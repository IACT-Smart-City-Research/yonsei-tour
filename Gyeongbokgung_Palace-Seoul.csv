Nice to see everyone in Hanbok! ,"First time here after rent hanbok at one of the store for 4 hours. Free entrance to Gyeongbokgung Palace if you’re wearing hanbok. Luckily no rain as the palace not all sheltered and it was hot day. Enjoy taking photos all around the palace and great experience to watch the Changing Guard. I spend the time here for 3 hours include my coffee break at one of the cafe, should put more indoor seats as all customer feeling hot and need aircon! Overall its a huge palace, nice to walk around and get many nice spot to take pics wearing hanbok. "
"Good for visiting, not really worth the Wons.","If you would like just to have a look at the neighbourhood, the grand palace and people strolling with their traditional hanbok, you can just stay outside and take wonderful pictures without having to soend your money getting inside as there were not so much to see."
Didn't know it's a replica,We went there thinking this is a real historic palace to only learn from the tour guide that it was rebuilt after WWII (the Japanese had demolished the original palace and built a modern government building on the same site!)
"Great, has many influence","Nice big complex, with múltiple buildings, historical place , i take with tour compañía, But cheaper by subway, a must if you go to seoul"
Historically endowed,"Everything about this Palace resonates history and the rich culture of the Koreans. Entry is free for vistors in the traditional outfit (Hanbok) and at a low cost for visitors without the outfit. There are several shops near the near Palace where you can rent a Hanbok for 1 to 2hours. The cost of renting my outfit was ₩10,000 for 2hours. The palace also has a park where you can have lunch after some sightseeing. This is worth your last penny. Enjoy"
First time at Gyeongbokgung Palace,"I visited Gyeongbokgung Palace on March 10th 2019, for me was a cold day since I live in the carribean, and thought I'd love to wear a hanbok, i could bear to be in thos very thin fabric dresses, so I skip that and pay the fee to access the palace. The place is HUGE I walked and walked and walked is seem endless. I visited the museum of South Korean history,was very interesting and very big too.The building I love to watch the most was the main building where the throne of the King was, and to watch the show of the change of guard at the main entrance of the palace. Was a great experience and I highly recommend it. Z"
Amazing!,"Unforgettable visit, will definitely return for another visit next time in Seoul! Very traditional architecture!"
Historic Palace Worth a Visit,"A visit to Gyeongbokgung should be on everyone’s list when visiting Seoul. It was the main palace for the Joseon Dynasty, the last dynasty before the Japanese colonization in 1910. It is significant historically, but also worth visiting because of its beauty. Be sure to rent some traditional clothing before going in to get some unique pictures that will be truly memorable!"
Beautiful Palace,"We had the fortunate timing of watching the palace guard change ceremony, and it was an event to watch. For those who are multi-lingual, the broadcast is in 4 languages: Korean, Japanese, Chinese, and English. The palace itself is grand, even though it's not the same scale as the Forbidden City in Beijing. Still, it is worthy of a visit."
Beautiful,We really enjoyed walking about the palace and learning some of the history. The dynasty and royalty is fascinating and the structures are beautiful.
Interesting,"If you ignore the whole place was rebuilt not long ago and hence isn't particularly original (although, of course, rebuilt in its impressive, historical, form) it is definitely worth seeing. Sprawling, busy and imposing it is a must when visiting Seoul."
Nice place to visit ,"Very nice place to visit while in Seoul. Historical site, not to crowded. Spend nice time there. Recomend it for everyone visiting even if they have little time. However is not worth to wait for the change of guards. "
The Happiest I ever was when i was here for half a day!!,Tried on a hanbok and had fun being silly photo taking and walking around the palace. Saw a cordoned off throne seating area. Walked the grounds in the summer heat but still enjoyed myself.
Largest and oldest of the palaces.,"This palace (mostly restored) is the oldest of the Joseon dynasty. Free for those over 65 and note that 64 in US counts as 65 in Korea (bring your passport for proof of age). Otherwise, just 3,000 won.Very large and many photo ops. Be sure to spend time in the free Palace Museum just outside the paying area."
A must see in Seoul,"Take metroline 3 (orange) and get out at Gyeongbokgung station. This is a must see/do when in Seoul. It´s one of the most well maintained historical sites I have ever visited. Like many ´main tourist attractions´ it´s full of tourists, but because many locals like to rent traditional clothing and walk around all dressed up it gives you a very authentic feeling (until you all see people taking selfies and you are reminded they are from 2019 and not from the past). For me it was a great way to get to know Seoul/ South Korea on my first day. I went on my own for a quick visit, but if you have a chance to do a guided tour and learn about it´s history I think that would be very interesting. The place itself is huge and you can easily hang around for two hours. Later I found out there was a huge chunk of the park I missed (the water part) because I crossed over to the National folk museum, which is also well worth a visit by the way. If you have more time and feel like walking a bit more, you can also visit the Bukchon Hanok village at about 500 meters distance."
"Yeah, it’s a bit like the Forbidden City of Seoul","Nice enough, but big open space and after you’ve stared at it for 5-10 mins...wondering what to do with one’s self. "
Nighttime Viewings Are Available on Specific Days Throughout the Year,"On the dates posted on their official website (in Korean; not in English), foreigners can purchase up to 4 tickets at the ticket booth with a valid ID/passport. When I visited in September 2019, nighttime ticket sales started at 6:30 pm. Visitors were able to enter the palace at 6:40 pm, and were guided to go out at 9:00 pm. Hanboks (Korean traditional dresses) look gorgeous with the palace's night view!"
Wonderful visit.,"The buildings, the grounds and the history are incredible. Everything you see is historic.To start, we took the #3 train and got off at the Jongno station, exit 1 takes you straight to the palace and museum. We got there right when the changing of the guards had finished so be there by 10 am or 2 pm if you want to see it. But we were able to go on the 11 am guided tour in English, it is free and it is the only way to know what you are seeing because most buildings look the same. The tour takes an hour and then you can walk around by yourself. It is very inexpensive, around $2.50 US unless you dress in traditional Korean clothes, then it is free.At the end exit towards the Seoul Library and walk to the Bukchon Hanok Village ."
Very nice ,"Very nice place, great to come over the weekend and see the local Koreans dressed on their traditional clothing "
Enthralling history,"Gyeongbokgung Palace was the royal palace of Joseon dynasty. Our tour guide, Erica, gave a detailed history of this dynasty and the sons fought with each other to occupy the throne and that lead to the construction of the other main palace. She explained about the summer and winter offices and rooms considering how hot and cold the temperature reaches during theses season in South Korea. Also, the change of guards is one of the major attractions of this palace. Don't miss it. Must visit."
Gorgeous piece of Joseon Dynasty,"An amazing, sprawling site you have to visit in Seoul. Get there by 10am on a weekday and you'll have a perfect view for the changing of the guard. it's an awesome show. Rent a traditional hanbok at a shop nearby, get in free and supercharge your instagram, yo."
Historical,"Since we booked a nearby hostel, it was just a good walk from our place. The palaces are quite interesting which gives you an idea of how they used to lived during the old times.It was a good thing that it was not crowded when we visited so we really enjoyed the beauty of the place."
Beautiful architecture,"This Palace has some beautiful architecture & bugger structures than Seoul other palaces, but this makes it a lot busier. The buildings are set in a classic structure - as you pass through the biggest & most regal first, then lots of structures of lesser quality follow after with buildings & Court yards to either side.This Palace is easy to wander on your own without a guide.The route follows through to the National Folk Museum & also the is the National Museum of Korea at the side. "
A must see in Seoul,"Love this Palace in every season. The Main Royal Palace of the Joseon Dynasty - if you are going to visit just one cultural site on your visit to Seoul I would recommend the Gyeongbokgung Palace. You can tour on your own, help a student volunteer offering a tour, or join a free guided tour offered by the management office in English, Japanese, Chinese, or Korean. Entry is a reasonable 3000 for adults, 1,500 for juniors and free for under 6y or over 65y. Changing of the guard takes place at 1000 and 1400 inside the Gwanghwamun gate and Gate Guard duty performance outside the gate is at 1100 and 1300 daily. Even without seeing these performances wandering through is worthwhile, you can see the blue house from the far corner of the grounds, and the National Folk museum entrance is connected to the eastern side. Highly recommend to all - accessible and enough room for the little ones to get some energy out."
I really feel like a princess,Gyeongbokgung Palace itself was easy to find! (Stop at gyeongbokgung station). Rent a hanbok and you are able to enter for free !! I must say the palace is big and beautiful As for me i really want to visit the palace as i always seen it on tv so seeing it in real life is amazing! Its big that you need 2 hours to explore the whole area and there’s alot of pretty spots where you can take photos with your hanbok!! Definitely recommend to visit with your hanbok because you’ll feel like you are a princess/prince!! But of course there will be alot of tourist so come early so there not much people!
Hanbok dress earns free entrance,A wonderful slice of history brought to life. Probably most easily navigated for tourists as part of a city tour. Note that there's free entrance to the palace for people in tradition Hanbok dress.
Elegant and spacious,This palace is a must-see if you are in Seoul for the first time. We visited on a national cultural day so many visitors had rented traditional clothing which made the visit even more colorful and entry was free this day. This palace is immense with many internal sections so plan on spending a few hours walking around the grounds. It is possible to rent headphones with a device where you point to a spot on the map and it gives you a detailed history (available in multiple languages). We witnessed the changing of the guard (at 10 am) which was a colorful event. The gardens and ponds in the back are serene and beautiful. There is also a museum full of national treasures from the Joseon Dynasty. Definitely worth a visit!
Must see,"If you're coming to Seoul, this place is a must see. The grounds are huge so be prepared to do a lot of walking. The view of the mountains is very majestic. You can rent a hanbok in nearby shops so you can enter for free which i highly recommend if you really want that Korean feel during your tour and take nice pictures in centuries old architecture. "
Good to see!,"The palace is sooo big... and many photo spots in here. Bring your camera. And dont forget to watch guard ceremony @ 11.00 AM, and 14.00 PM ... "
Most Impressive Of The Three Castles Visited,This castle was completed in 1395 shortly after the founding of the Joseon Dynasty. It was destroyed during the Japanese invasion of 1592 and was reconstructed in 1867.During the Japanese Occupation between 1910 and 1945 most of the buildings were torn down and work continues to fully restore the place since 1990. It is large and impressive and provides an interesting perspective of Korean history. It can get crowded but the grounds are extensive so it is not an issue.Access is via the Orange Line at Anguk or Gyeongokgung Stations.
Bring your canera,"After a while the palaces start to look alike, but they each are beautiful in their own way. Best viewed in the winter or after a storm because the skies are usually cleared of smog and yellow dust. Take your time while walking around, take ur all in. "
The most touristic thing to do,"If you are just looking to do what everyone ‘should do’ coming to Seoul, go there, rent a ‘traditional’ costume and take lots of selfies for your instagram posts.Otherwise stay away. Most of what you will see is less then 20 years old and there are so many dressed up tourists, it feels like carnival. There are much better places to get an impression of historical palaces.On the other hand, the two musea on site are worth it. One is focused on daily lives of Korean people through time and the other one boast a solid collection of the interiors of the palaces."
A nice photo stop,We came here on a cloudy day and didn’t choose to go deep into the palace compounds by paying an entrance fee. Tourists were soaking in the atmosphere with their rented hanboks.
History ,"Great place to visit if you are in Seoul, gives you a good feel of life back in the emperors time. Only knock is there are no real signs or plaques explaining what your looking at, but for the couple of dollars changed to get in, it was well worth it. "
Amazing especially at noon,Nice and worthwhile visit to the best palace complex of the city.. Try to have a sunset visit that will give you a unique and less crowded experience
Historical Visit,We recommend to visit this magnificent palace during weekends so that you can engage a volunteer tour guide to show you around the palace and giving you more insights into the Korean dynasty era. A nice place for history lovers! 
It takes you back in Time,The interesting thing about the visit was we had to dress the traditional hanbok or Chosŏn-ot and visit the palace. We were lucky to arrive during the changing of the guards at 4 p.m. The changing of the guards are done twice a day in the mornings and evenings. 
Details & Tips on visiting Gyeongbokgung Palace!,"Very beautiful palace that is super huge with lots to explore! Very photogenic palace. My friend and I got our hanbok rental + photography services on Klook Travel. It was a great experience and we went home with a lot of lovely shots to remember the day. Do check out the weather forecast before going! It happened to be drizzling when we went, which made the hanbok skirts wet and difficult to walk in, but the air was really nice and cooling! I personally think I enjoyed it better with the drizzles than if it was a really hot sunny day. Just avoid pouring rain and bring an umbrella in case. Here's a lil more about the place :> Largest & most beautiful of the 5 Grand Palaces> Built in 1395> represented the sovereignty of Joseon DynastyEntrance Fee is 3k wonFREE for seniors over 65yo, visitors in hanbok (you can rent nearby) and on Culture Day (last Wed of the month)> Free guided tours in 4 languages between 10am - 4pm> 2 types of Guard changing ceremonies between 10am - 2pm (Changing of palace guard ceremony inside Gwanghwamun gate & Gate Guard duty performance outside Gwanghwamun gate)> FOOD TIP : There is a Tosokchon Samgyetang nearby which is very well known for their Korean Ginseng Chicken. It is on the left side of Gyeongbokgung Palace.If you liked my review, do me a favor and give me a thumbs up please? :) I hope to share more as I travel! Thank you! Happy traveling!"
Cultural heritage,"A must-visit location in Seoul, portraying Korean architecture and culture. Try wearing hanbok (Korean traditional dress) while visiting the palace. "
A place to immerse yourself with Korean history.,This is a fabulous place for anyone and everyone to explore Korea history. From the palace walls to the museum inside you definitely get a sense of what the old days were like and beauty that Korea has Architect wise. The price to enter is such a small amount $3 USD or free if you rent a hanbok- which I highly recommended for memorable pictures.
“The palace greatly blessed by Heaven” ⛩,"The Gyeongbokgung Palace is an amazing experience and worth the visit when in Seoul! Step back into time more than 600 years to walk these grounds and take in all the history that makes this palace a “MUST VISIT”.! The grounds are vast with countless buildings, gates and walls to wonder around and take in all the aspects of Korean history and culture! Make sure you give yourself at least a couple hours for this one; it is spread out with lots to take in. Highly recommend.!!"
Love the surrounding,"Its a nice places to learn about the culture. You can try to use hanbok and the clothes are very pretty. Many foreigners as well as local use that during the visit. They have guard shift ceremony every 10 am and 2 pm, make sure not to miss this ceremony. The palace environment felt once you arrive the gyeongbokgung subway."
Birthday trip,"Wow. Visiting Gyeongbokgung Palace was the highlight on this one day tour. We felt as if we were transported back in time, by just walking through the Palace gate. It felt surreal for me. Seeing the size of the property and the designs certainly added to the mystique of the surroundings. The changing of the guards reminds me of British Palace tours, only more colorful and artsy. Added to the attraction were the visitors of all ages wearing rented traditional garbs. Amazingly awesome place to visit. We spent an hour here including visit to the National Folk museum situated on the same grounds. A must see when you go. "
Must See In Seoul,"We went in the morning with an organized tour group and we loved it. Admittedly, it always helps to have good weather and a clear, blue sky but the Palace grounds are very large and beautiful with plenty of different things to see. We also attended the Changing of the Guard ceremony which I would really recommend. I'd also recommend going with a tour guide because otherwise you'll be walking through the grounds not knowing what you see and you could get lost in this ""labyrinth"" and hence maybe miss some important buildings and stories. From the limited things I've seen in Seoul (it was a joint business/family 2-day trip), this was the highlight."
A Must visit in Seoul,"Very good morning touring around the Palace and surrounding buildings. Extensive grounds to walk around with many buildings. Most enjoyable was the changing of the guard at 10am and 2pm, also watching all the people dressed up in traditional clothing taking pictures."
The best of the Big Palaces!,"This Palace also houses the Korean National Palace Museum and the National Folk Museum.Because it was the biggest remaining Korean palace , the whole complex was systematically destroyed during the Japanese Occupation at the beginning of the 20th Century, and is slowly being rebuilt , including demolition of former Japanese government buildings to recreate the majestic Palace gateways! So everything you see today is very recent."
Close to center of city,"It was built prior to Forbidden City of China, but a bit smaller and maybe a bit simpler?Overall, enjoyed the changes of guard, even though they were all actors. As the biggest of the 5 palaces in Seoul, it is still a must to do list, but may not need to visit the other palaces after this one. "
Beautiful,"Free English and Korean tours available, usually 1.5 hour long. Three times a day, last is at 330pm or so. This was on a Sunday for us. I recommend the tour guides bc it makes seeing the building and at different aspects more enjoyable and knowing their history is a plus.Admission is 3000 won/ adult. Credit card accepted. You can rent traditional clothing and get free admission, rental rates is cheaper as you get further from the palace. Usually 10000 won nearby the palace. Folk museum is right next door and free admission. "
Great ,This place is a must visit to all visitors! You must rent Hanbok and take picture in the palace. Great view and great picture. 
Palace with a lot of greenery,"Less opulent than the Forbidden City in Beijing, but more trees, flowers, and greenery. Lovely to walk around and see people in hanbok (beautifully crafted traditional clothing)."
Worth it all!,"Beautiful place, definitely a place to visit with family, we got to know and understood a lot of the wonderful Korean culture."
MUST,"Simply a must see in Korea. Even if most of it has been rebuilt as it was mostly destroyed by Japs and Korean War after that, it is now in good condition. Large park, beautiful architecture, what are you waiting for?!"
Historical,Getting into the Gyeongbokgung Palace brings you back to the ancient scenes of Korea and makes you understand more their culture and history.
A day from the past,"It was an interesting place. The palace is a large area with different buildings and gardens. By the entrance gate it was very crowded but the more you walk inside, the less people there is. Alot of people are dressed in the traditional clothes, so it was very interesting. It felt like a movie set or a scene from the past. The buildings were simple with colored wood decorations."
Got Great Pics of Costumed Visitors,"I went by myself via the subway, which was very safe and interesting. The palace a short walk from the stop. I timed my arrival with the changing of the guard. I spent 2-3 hours here, wandering about and taking photos. The numerous costumed guests afforded me great shots as they posed, ran, or peaked out. The entry fee was reasonable. I'm happy tourists are allowed to view the grounds.Afterwards, I walked around the area and saw a huge protest at Gwanghwamun Square, which is a gathering place in front of the palace. I was told there something going on there almost daily. A further bit down the road and I ran into a Starbucks and then on to the tourist information center, where they were very helpful. I need an SD card for my phone and they called the nearby bookstore and inquired if they did indeed sell the cards as I had been told. I then walked across the street, to the bookstore, and discovered that it is nothing like I would know in the USA. They sell all manner of things inside that store. It was very interesting there too. This area is a must-see!"
Seoul day tour,"Amazing place to visit. We did this as part eof our Seoul full day tour, so our guide explained alot. We arrived right as the changing of the guard ceremony was beginning. Plenty to see and learn. "
Just Ike K-Drama,Interesting visit to the palace. Lots of other tourists in rented Hanboks to make the place more fun to visit. It would have been better with more signage to share more about the different areas of the palace and its history. Else it’s a nice stroll that takes about 2-3 hours. Nice shopping and food surrounding the palace too. 
Place to visit in Seoul,This historical place gives wonderful Korean experience. Lot of people wear Korean dress ( that gives free entry) and walk around. Many of photo sports. One can take free guided tours on specific times. A must see place if you visit Seoul.
"Packed with people in traditional costume, excellent guide!","We joined the free English tour, which was really excellent, informative and entertaining. If you come in traditional costume, the entrance fee is waived, but it was summer, so our hosts opted for the cooler choice of paying for the tickets. We were thankful!! Plenty of photo opps, beautiful grounds and buildings, fascinating history. "
Beautiful place of History must visit,If you are visiting seoul this is one of the places that it must be in your list to visit.Recommend to rent a hanok to wear which is the triditional korean custom and if you dress it you get a free entrace to the palace.The entrace for an adult cost 3000 KRW.Hanok custom rental for 2 hrs cost around 14000- 18000 KRW. Could be cheaper as a just visited on shop so cant compare prices with other.
Nice place,Royal Guard Changing Ceremony at Gyeongbokgung Palace was very interesting. Royal guard ware traditional cloth. Please check schedule for this ceremony!!
amazing place,"lovely palace with beautiful agrdens and ponds. great photo opprtunities. Dress up in traditional clothes (Hambok) for that special pic and feel, also for free entry in to the palace grounds. "
Visit to Gyengbokgung palace,One of the landmarks for Seoul and suitable to visit on a weekend. The place is colourful. Many people are dressed in traditional costumes. The trip can be completed by a visit to the nearby village. I recommend it for anyone interested to immerse himself in the past era of Korea.
Half a day MINIMUM,"One of the biggest palaces in terms of walking and things to see. Bit of a health and safety hazard, so watch young children as falls are signposted but there are few barriers. Pro of this, is better pictures without black and yellow health and safety tape on all edges. It's a little maze, and there's many complexes to see. Grab a free map from the entrance and tick off places as you visit, Look out for Korean's wearing traditional clothes and having photo shoots in the grounds. Easily could spend a full day here.Get it as part of the Royal Palace pass to get a discount - pass is valid for 3 months from purchase date."
Big palace compound ,"This is a huge palace compound. A clear fine product of the Korean Dynasty. There are a few gates and halls with distinctive architects for perfect photo. Even so when one dress in the traditional Hanbok. While the inner compound is stone paved and very bare, there is an outer area of greenery. This is the part we enjoyed most. Old trees, green grass, big pond with the willow trees which contrasted the inner court. Really enjoy the stroll and relax atmosphere. Another perfect spots for photos. "
AWESOMEEE,"Unfortunately we forgot to visit at the back side of the palace. Wear hanbok for free entrance. Hanbok rental is from 12,00/hour18,00/4hourThe shop just across the road from side gate of gyeongbukgung.There are many hanbok rental shop around there."
Beautiful and well preserved Bukchon village and Gyeongbokgung palace,Cheap entrance ticket or free when you enter wearing with traditional Korean “Hanbok” which can be rented in many shops in Bukchon village.Nice well preserved palaces and beautiful lake.
Thunder and Tragedy,"Into every lengthy vacation this side of the Gobi, some rain must fall. My luck finally ran out on my last day in Seoul, with a thunderstorm intense enough to put Noah’s 40 days to shame. Nevertheless, I was determined to see one specific ghost-ridden spot within Gyeongbokgung, of world-wide historical importance, rain or no. Pelting rain at the vast complex in August does keep you cool. Distant rain-shrouded mountains turn grey and misty, like an ink painting come to life (see Heungnyemun and Geunjeongleon photos). Gyeonghoeru Pavilion’s roof blends with its rain-swept lake, and its red eaves and balconies take on an (appropriately for me) sombre tone (see Gyeonghoeru Pavilion and Gyeonghoeru Eaves photos). And the colourful interiors of the Geunjeongleon Throne Room and Sajeongjeon’s Hall of Worthies are bright by comparison (see Throne Hall and Hall of Worthies photos). At Gyeongbokgung, these are a thunderstorm’s sole virtues.I worried that the rain would scare away all the Hanbok Belles, one of the aesthetic joys of visiting any Korean palace. But the downpour didn’t deter the Belles from strutting their stuff in the national dress. Their attitude seemed to be “Rain, fiddlesticks! We’ve never met the rainstorm yet that could whip our hoop skirts!” (See Hanbok 1, Hanbok 2 and Hanbok 3 photos).And tears from Heaven were appropriate given my reason for being there. I was headed to the back of Gyeongbokgung, as far from the entrance and the crowds as you can go, to see Geoncheonggung Palace. A barbaric event occurred there: the sadistic butchering of Queen Min: usually called an “assassination” though that word doesn’t begin to capture the horror of the actual event. That crime on October 8th, 1895 started a half-century reign of terror, with consequences still hanging over us.Following the Meiji Restoration, Japanese nationalism generated militarism and a policy of foreign expansion. Expansion generally means war, but does not necessarily mean systematic and sadistic barbarity. For all World War I’s horrors, the French, British and Germans on the Western Front neither tortured prisoners of war nor systematically gang-raped their enemies’ young women. For years the Austro-Hungarian and Italian armies on the Isonzo Front scrupulously abided by the Hague Conventions. Even the first chess-move in Japan’s drive to expand, against China in 1894, was a relatively gentlemanly naval affair, though one-sided. Japan got Formosa, but the Western powers blocked them from getting the mainland Chinese territory they’d demanded. So Japan turned back to another target they’d long been eyeing: Korea. Korea’s timorous emperor could easily be coerced. Japan’s problem was that Empress Myeongseong, “Queen Min”, could not be. To counter Japanese instructors of Korean militia, Queen Min brought in military instructors from the USA. Queen Min strengthened relations with Tsarist Russia, Korea’s northern neighbour, as a counter to Japan. Queen Min even got the Chinese Customs Service extended into Korea. That internationally-run service honestly collected customs revenues and delivered those revenues to Peking, and now to Seoul as well, thus strengthening foreign relations, and funding military improvements. Tokyo had been within an ace of making Korea a Japanese puppet. Now Korea was fast slipping out of their fingers, all due to Queen Min, particularly when she ordered the disbanding of that Japanese-trained militia. Viscount Miura, one of Japan’s most senior statesmen, was dispatched to Korea to remedy this. Miura decided to make Korea’s emperor “an offer he couldn’t refuse.” In the middle of the night, on October 8th, 1895, Japan staged a military-style assault on the Geoncheonggung Palace. The attackers included some pro-Japan Korean traitors, but the hard core of the assault were 60 or so Japanese. The palace guards were overwhelmed and massacred. Miura’s Japanese agents caught up with Queen Min and her maids of honour as they were trying to escape through a patio. First Queen Min was repeatedly raped; then she was hacked with swords, and finally she was burned along with her maids of honour, possibly while some of them were still alive. The king fled in terror to the Russian legation, where he was given sanctuary. It was obvious that Miura had ordered the barbarism, and the whole world was outraged, including Japan’s powerful ally, Great Britain. Due to that, the Japanese government was compelled to put Miura on trial for the crime. Perhaps if they’d hung him, the hard-line faction in Tokyo would have been cowed. We’ll never know, because the trial was as outrageous as the crime. Miura freely admitted that he had ordered the crime. His defence attorney argued that Miura should be acquitted on the grounds that no act done in the national interest of Japan, no matter how grisly, could ever be criminal. The Japanese court then found Miura innocent on grounds of insufficient evidence! Miura was hailed and honoured as a national hero. What more encouragement could Japan’s most ruthless factions have gotten? The Japanese are NOT a nation of sadistic thugs; just as Germans, Spaniards and Turks aren’t, despite Auschwitz, the Inquisition, and the Armenian massacres. But in all these countries, for a while, the worst elements were in control. During the half-century after Queen Min’s assassination, there was always an opposition to the direction that Japan was headed. What Queen Min’s assassination and Miura’s acquittal did, was to terrifically boost the power and arrogance of the extremists. Over those next 50 years, even respected senior Japanese statesmen would be assassinated with impunity by them. A dark path was taken; it started here. It led to the the 300,000 victims of the Rape of Nanking, to the slaughter at Singapore’s Alexandria Hospital, the Bataan Death March, the horrors committed in Intramuros, the victims—perhaps hundreds of thousands of them—of Unit 731’s biological warfare testing; and the hundreds of thousands of sex slaves whose lives were destroyed: 80% of these “comfort women” were Korean. Jaoan’s path led to a 50-year road, then highway, then super-highway of ever-increasing horror, which was only stopped by the counter-horror of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Over the 50 years that Japan ruled Korea, the Japanese diligently demolished places that might evoke Korean nationalism. Most of Gyeongbokgung Palace wound up being knocked down, and needless to say, Queen Min’s palace was one of the first to go. Korea has worked slowly and steadily at rebuilding exact replicas of the heritage that its enemies demolished, including Geoncheonggung Palace. If you go there, I was assured that what you see is identical with what stood there on that night. And you really are standing on hallowed ground.You can go to lots of other assassination sites: Ghandi Smriti, the Church of the Savior on Blood, Dealey Plaza, even the spot in the Theatre of Pompey where Julius Caesar was done in by Brutus. But if I am correct that the assassination of Queen Min lit a fuse igniting 50 years of horrors in Asia, and leading ultimately to the Damocles sword of intercontinental nuclear war that now hangs over all of us, then I can think of only one other assassination spot on Earth that matches this one for historic significance: the memorial plaque just off the Latin Bridge in Sarajevo, where Franz Ferdinand and Sophie were killed."
The Best attraction in Seoul..,"I really fell in love with Gyeongbokgung Palace.It's a big palace that shows the greatness of old Korean Kingdom.It's very easy see locals dressing in national costume: that's make the atmosphere even more magical.We also saw the changing of guard ceremony.Entrance ticket is cheap, only 3.000 won each."
Gyeongbokgung Palace,It's really interesting for visit the palace of the country we visit. This palace is the main one with beautiful views. 
Very nice place for pictures.,The palace grounds are very big and although there are lots of ppl around you can find a spot to take pics. 
Gyeongbokgung Palace - really must see,Top attraction in Seoul. Get there by 10:00am to see the changing of the guard. Stand in front of the ticket booth for the best views so you see them coming in the gate. 
Great way to spend an afternoon,"Even though this is all reconstruction, it's a pleasant view into the past. As most of Korea was devastated by war, we were thrilled that this complex has been recreated. On the day of our visit, a Sunday, we were treated to scores of folks in traditional Korea dress which only added greatly to the charm. We spent approximately two hours strolling through the grounds and enjoyed it immensely. It was well worth the visit!"
Sprawling complex of structures,"The palace is spread out over a large area and be prepared to do alot of walking. The map in English may not be accurate in identifying the different structures. For those who are conversant with Chinese characters, it's probably good to have the map with Chinese too as most of the structures have Chinese character names. The change of guard ceremony is interesting but not a must watch if you're short of time. Not allowed to enter most of the structures, can only view from outside. After a few of them, they all looked similar."
Palace,"The palace is quite lovely. I took the train to Gyeongbokgung station and walked to the exit marked with ‘palace’, super easy to get too, two trains from Seoul Station. I walked around the palace grounds visiting the large number of buildings. The grounds were beautiful, I highly recommend this palace. "
Spectacular Palace Ideal Exploratory Walk,This is one of the sites within Seoul that you actually get a sense what the early Korean architecture and culture would have been like in the 1400s and later. Much of the country was later destroyed in various wars. It is very photogenic as many locals rent historical costumes to wear while they visit the palace. The palace covers a large area and you should count on at least an hour to walk and explore the grounds.

Don't forget to go to Tosokchon to taste the original Samgyetang (Ginseng Chicken Soup) in the left side of this palace, or Bukchon Hanok Village in the right side."
Best palace to look around,"We were fortunate that the palace was free to enter on the day we went, however, even if you have to pay, it's the best palace in the city.It's also charming to see locals, especially youngsters dressing in national costume to get the best pictures for their Instagram account.There are a couple of cafes in the grounds and also at the museum towards the back if you need a break."
VIP Tours,They provide a guide and transportation. Very enjoyable tour. Guide spoke excellent English and ver knowledgeable.
One of the main tourist attraction in Seoul,"It was good to know the history of the biggest palace of Korean history. Pack of people taking pictures with hanbok in the front area, but if you walk more inside the complex area, there are less crowded place."
Lovely place to visit,"Gyeongbokgung Palace is a lovely place to visit and take photos, especially if you rent Hanbok (traditional Korean outfits). It doesn't cost much to visit, maybe 3000 won, but if you rent Hanbok you can get in for free and take awesome photos."
Must in Seoul! ,"It is the biggest palace as I know in Seoul. It is better to enjoy during the spring or fall, but it has it’s own beauty every season.So don’t hesitate to visit this palace! :)"
Beautiful palace ,A really great day out with English speaking tours! There was so much to see and learn about and we were lucky enough to visit whilst a guard ceremony was taking place.
Must visit in Seoul ,"Easily accessible in Seoul, gorgeous Palace, cheap to get in, look for traditional events on evening. "
A must visit for a bit of culture and history,It was a bit rainy when we came but don't let that put you off if you're prepared. There's a lot of buildings to walk around and see. There's also a Cafe and gift shop if you want to stop and rest a bit
Grand Palace,"Gyeongbokgung Palace is the grandest of Seoul's 5 royal palaces. It has had several uses through time but is now a major tourist attraction. The Royal Palace pass works here, the entrance fee is 3000KW. The Gyeonghoeru Pavilion is only visitable by pre-booking online, this is free. The guided tour is in Korean only."
Come see the changing of the guards,"Gyeongbokgung Palace is somewhat like the Forbidden City - smaller, but laid out as a series of inner squares with temples. (Also, less built up, less crowded and generally more accessible.) Watching the changing of the guard is an especially nice time/way to visit!"
Free this week ,Free as it is Korea National Day this week. Nice corridors to take photos but bad for a hot day.You will see lots of tourists dressed in traditional clothingHowever today It is scorching no shelter or shade to cool.Plan well before entering on hot day. 
Fun place!,"Dreaded going to this place as Im not a fan of historical sites but this was so different and a lot of fun! It was a pleasant surprise. Firstly, we rented hanboks from one of the many hanbok rental shops (10,000 won for 2 hours) really near the palace, it was fun choosing and coordinating the colours. And then we got to enter the palace for free because of our hanbok attire. It was a great experience to see this historical landmark and wear traditional korean clothes! Totally brought us back in time and felt so in character. P.s: It was in summer and wearing the hanboks made us feel warmer than ideal. Haha."
A place that boast of their history,This palace is the largest of all five palaces famous in Seoul. The beauty is mesmerizing. There is a small restaurant also that serves basic food along with some souvenirs. It will take around two hours to visit the place. The entry is not free here so ready to pay an amount that you won't regret later. A must visit place. 
Getting immersed in Korean History,"A fascinating palace complex which was the main palace of the longstanding Joseon Dynasty. It is preferable to visit with a tour guide who can provide background both on the history of the dynasty and the significance of the buildings. Its grounds also house the National PalaceMuseum and the National Folk Museum, both of which are worth visiting."
The largest of them all,"The entire palace grounds is huge as it houses 2 museums and numerous restored buildings within. The complimentary guided tour was quite informative and interesting. There are still many buildings yet to be restored and the government has been making good effort into the restoration of this palace back to its glory. It would be interesting to go again when there are more buildings. The two museums within its grounds are free to enter. The Royal Palace Museum is definitely a must if you would like to catch a glimpse into the past and the lives of those who used to live in Gyeongbukgung. This palace along with Changdeokgung, Changyeonggung, Deoksugung, the Secret Garden and Jongmyo Shrine are included in the Royal Palace Pass at 10,000 won. Really good deal."
Large palace complex.,"Located in the center of Seoul, conveniently accessible by subway. A lot of people, local girls in national costumes. On the territory there is a museum of royal life. If you go to the end of the complex, you can go to the presidential palace. Also, there is an art crafts museum nearby, very interesting!"
Iconic Symbol of Korea,"Most iconic symbol of all of Korea. The largest and most scenic of all the Palace with Mount Bugaksan in the background. Changing of the Guard Ceremony is a must: 1000 and 1300. Entry Fee is 3,000 won. Close every Tuesday. You can reach Gyeongbokgung Palace by taking Subway Line 3 to Gyeongbokgung Station Exit 3. "
Historical,If you love history and going back in time this is a place you must see. You can even dress up in the clothes they did.
PREPARE TO WALK,"This is a very interesting place, but if you don't like walking a lot, it is a place to avoid!The stones you mostly walk on are uneven and it can be very tiring and hard on the legs and feet."
take lots of pics!,"if you wear a hanbok, you get in free! there were many, many people wearing gorgous hanboks with their sig others graciously taking pics of them. great photo op with you in the traditional dress of korea. it's a very large area to walk around so never felt crowded even though there was quite a crowd there on a warm summer afternoon. exiting is difficult however we did find another one toward the history museum/hanok areas."
Anything Open?,"We went and it was pretty cool to see, but seemed to be missing something. One thing we noticed pretty quick was most places were closed and you could only see the outside of the buildings.If you have been to The Forbidden City, this can be a disappointment."
Could genuinely spend hours here.,"No exaggeration, you could easily spend 4-5 hours roaming the palace grounds. It's absolutely massive and full of things to explore. Great photo ops all over as well. Normally there's an entrance fee, but I went last week and didn't have to pay anything. One thing to note, when they say it closes at 6, they mean your butt better be out by 6. Those guards do not play at all, lol."
Like a dream,"This was the very first place we wanted to visit when coming to Seoul. We took the opportunity to rent traditional hanboks in one of the numerous shops longing the palace, so the entrance was free (if you don't rent one, then you must pay the entrance ticket). A walk in the palace took us a good two hours, it is even bigger than we thought when looking at it from outside. It feels quite magical when you're interested in Korean culture, even more when lots of visitors are wearing hanboks themselves. There are a lot of spots to take pictures, sometimes you might meet Korean people asking to take a picture with you!You cannot go inside the palace though, you can check what's inside from the windows. But it was overall a really good visit and we felt really involved thanks to the outfits. I recommend renting a hanbok to visit, it doesn't feel the same than when you wear your own clothes!"
Royal palace of the Joseon dynasty,"Must see in Seoul. Picturesque architecture, interesting history, It's worth seeing a change of guard. I recommend to come early, right after opening - this way you can avoid long queues that appear later."
Buildings,It was very pretty but the vibe I got was very touristy so I could not really enjoy it. There wasn't much more than eggshell buildings you could take pictures in. 
Beautiful place,Beautiful place and big complex. I visited the place with my parents and it is difficult to find toilets around
Picturesque ,A beautiful palace to visit - not as busy in the morning so I recommend going as early as you can when there are no ticket queues. We got there by about 10:30-10:45am and left by 12 and it was heaving - long queues. Lovely to see people walking around dressed in traditional outfits that they had rented. The areas surrounded by water are the most beautiful to see.
Historic site next to bustling city,Loved visiting this palace and it’s extensive grounds! Would be lovely to visit when weather is a little cooler as it is all outdoors. So historic and loved seeing people dressed in traditional clothing (hanbok).
Need to see in Seoul,If you dress traditional you don’t need to pay the entry. You can rent a dress in houses next to the palace. And have a photo shoot. Really great!50% is dressed like that. With makes it like you are in history....flash back.
Gyeongbokgung Palace,"I love history and it was amazing to visit the grand and amazing Gyeongbokgung Palace. Experience the changing of the guard ceremonies at the main entrance Gwanghwamun, the museums, ornamental gardens and some of Seoul's grandest architectural sights. Rent a Hanbook and besides getting free admission into the grounds with it, look good in your pics with the traditional Korean costume. Lots of culture and beauty in store here, like Gyotaejeon Hall and Amisan Garden, Gyeonghoeru Pavilion, Hyangwonjeong Pavilion, Sinmumun Gate, etc. Wear comfortable shoes for walking ....."
Beautiful Palace,"This historical palace is not to be missed when you are in Korea. We enjoyed walking in the grounds of the palace in our hanbok. You can sense the grandeur of the place during its time. Also, we were lucky enough to witness the changing of the guards ceremony."
Historical,This is a very important place for Korean History. It was an honor to review the palace and see where the Old School Kings lived.
Large Beautiful Palace.,"This place is huge. Many temples to see and the museums are included with the price. A lot of walking. Also got to see the changing of the guard, it is done twice a day. First one was at 10:00 am. "
Beautiful walk,To me it was more of a giant park than a historical palace visit. It is very large and so if you are wanting more than a beautiful peaceful walk I recommend going during one of the times with a tour guide.
Wear walking shoes!,"Beautiful gardens. Tour guides are very helpful and speak perfect English. It would have been a little easier to not wander in circles if the buildings and roads were better labeled. The grounds itself are really big, so make sure to wear walking shoes! If it's not too hot, go hire the hanbok costumes and experience the palace the way Korean royals would have in the Joseon era. "
Must see in Seoul,This huge palace is a must see while in Seoul. Its got so much to see and is right in the middle of the city. Lots of people were dressed up in traditional korean attire. Great place for pictures and scenery or just for a nice long walk.
Real Korean historical place,A history of Korean empire with. Beautiful architecture and surrounded by beautiful greenery.the cafeteria sitting place is very cute with wooden huts.
Beautiful palace in the middle a very busy city,Worth a trip to see this attraction. Just check opening hours. We arrived at 6.30 and it was closed so had to waiting until it re opened at 7pm. Also the late opening did not allow entry to the two Koreans I was with. After 7pm is for foreign visitors and older Koreans so we found out on the day.
Very Large,"A national treasure, but if you only visit one palace in Seoul, choose Changdeokgung Palace instead (I've left a review there, too). Gyeongokgung is gigantic, but in its current state feels empty. Actually, the museums inside were more interesting than the grounds themselves."
Royal Palace,Traditional custume.can rent and wear it..Creat special moment..it's royal and tradition of Korea.History of Korea
Peaceful,Instagramable view and different area to post even their trees are amazing like from the jungle also good for photo ops
Very big on a very hot day,"This palace is huge. The buildings are lovely. Not much to see inside them. Very cool though. Plan several hours if you want to see everything. The changing of the guards is something I only saw at this palace and was nice to see. Crowded toward the front, but far fewer people toward the back. Good view of the ""blue palace"" from the back gate. Gwanghwamun on the purple line is the subway stop I used."
Amazing Palace ,An Amazing Palace. You must see the guard change ans the Big garden. If you want all things to see you need a lot of time 
Beautiful,"Such a serene and beautiful palace set amongst the skyscrapers of Seoul. Must visit! Buy tickets online so you don’t ha e to wait in line. There are free tours in English but read the website to coordinate your visit during the times available. Very hot day, so we didn’t rent to wear any of the beautiful costumes. However I heard that if you do wear one, entrance is free. We truly appreciated those who braved the heat and donned costumes as it made our photos even more beautiful and colourful."
Very spacious with many things to see,"Make sure you find an offline map at the gate.It was a hot sunny day, and we travelled with a baby. The place was stroller friendly. Some of the areas were under constructions, including the famous small lake. But nonetheless, we managed to cover most of the areas and found many cheap and good quality souvenirs at the shop (make sure to try their drinks as well!). We got cute bookmarks, notes, even jewelries.Overall, it was a good place where you can have a leisurely stroll (even better if it's not too hot)."
Historical ,"A hug palace with historical architecture. If you want to explore this place, you should spend all day, its really big. "
"Hanbok costumes, while expensive, are photogenic","Renting hanbok costumes - traditional Korean dress - gives one free entry.Otherwise, the price is a most reasonable KRW3000 per person.\We visited on a weekday. It rained for 15 minutes but thankfully stopped.\The grounds are extensive and changing of the guard beautifully done. One can pose beside these individuals."
Breath taking ,"Gyeongbokgung palace was an amazing experience!!! To be submerged in korea's rich history and its tradition, i got to see alot of colorful hanboks(traditional korean clothing) and the amazing architecture surrounding the palace, the palace is huge, with alot of greeny and seats available for it's visitors, there are also bathroom facilities around the palace, although refrain from smoking! The palace also holds a Musuem, and in it a café and some gifts shops,you can also find an area of a very old 80's-town almost as if it got frozen in time, there are so many Hotspots to take selfies and photos so sometimes it can be over crowded but nonetheless the scenery is absolutely beautiful and to be in the presence of the palace was magical!!!! I felt i was reliving history "
Must visit,"Largest palace, entry free of 3000 won, free if wearing hanbok, must visit and have look at the grandeur, very beautifully maintained. Recommend joining a free tour for a very informative tour around the palace, can enter the palace museum and folk museum for free. "
Beautiful Historical Place,"The place was beautiful and historic. We saw a guard changing ceremony and it was amazing . There was a hanbok renting, but we decided that it was a too hot weather to rent a hanbok, so we rent a hanbok in Bukchon Hanok Village (see review of Bukchon Hanok Village). We took some beautiful pictures. Overall it was beautiful and historic."
Best Place ever,"Best place ever, it’s truly amazing. Some parts of it was under construcrion. Be aware that for the pavilon, you have to book tickets a day before. The entrance fee is unrealisticaly cheap. The avarage time what tourists spend there, is 3-3,5hour"
Great English-speaking guide,We joined one of the free English tour and the guide did a great job at summarizing the main points and explaining historical facts for people without knowledge of Korea history. The Palace itself is beautiful and the crowds of people/tourists dress in hanbok (traditional costumes) give it an additional charm. 
Beautiful Palace,This is a gorgeous Palace in downtown Seoul. Most of it has been rebuilt but it is historically accurate. Many people rent traditional clothes just outside the gate and then get in free to see the palace. We did not dress up as June in Korea is so hot.The palace itself is lovely to look at and you need about two hours to see it. Unfortunately you can't go inside any of the buildings; if you could it would really enhance the experience.
I am glad I visited,"I loved the place worth the visit, wearing the costume and taking photos it makes great memory pictures plus you can do the tour alone after doing some walk from the city"
Worth the visit,Love that it’s in the middle of city. Outside the walls is modern Korea. We were able to witness the exchange guards which was on Monday morning. Entrance is free if you wear traditional clothing which you can rent nearby stores. 
Good place to kill a couple of hours,Good place to walk around. Interesting to see everyone in national dress. (Not sure about the foreigners doing it as well though). Can be crowded. 
Palace is a palace,So we had to walk and walk and see where the women lived and where the king lived and where the conjugated. Sorry not my cup of tea. 
Korea's beautiful traditional palace.,This was built 500 years ago and some parts were burnt during Japan invade Chosun dynasty. It was restored and open to public. This palace is surrounded by mountain. Compare to Jaguemsung In China it seems small but this is more delicated. You can feel historic area among mordern Seoul. Nearby this palace you can reach many historic places around Jongro.
Impressive piece of history,"Thoroughly enjoyed walking through this palace and grounds. Opted to get dressed up in hanboks with my Korean friend and we were allowed free entry to the palace, which felt like a nice touch for tourists already spending money renting hanboks. The colours inside the buildings are mesmerising and my friend told us they were part of the decor to ward off evil energy or spirits, as well as the mythical creatures and sculptures at the end of the roofs. Very beautiful. Be sure to catch the guard changing ceremony as well, narrated via speakerphone in Korean, English, Japanese and Chinese."
Wonderful part of South Korea’s history,"During our stay in Seoul we went to visit this palace twice. The changing of the guards is wonderful with the instruments, precision and clothes. We enjoyed learning about the history of the kings of South Korea."
Mesmerising ,"I don't know where to start on reviewing this astonishingly beautiful palace except to say it us utterly beguiling and unmissable.It's so big and there is so much to see, different parts deserve their own listings to be honest!The highlight for me was the Gyeongheru Pavilion, just beautiful as its surrounded by a gorgeous lake. Its lovely to sit there and relax. Close second, and most people's favourite I'd say, is the majestic Geunjeongjon Hall which is the throne hall. The intricacy and colours are just mesmeric The King and Queens living quarters are lovely too and there is just so many lovely colourful and intricately decorated buildings around, not to mention scenic grounds. The row of chimneys in the Amisan Gardens to the rear of the queens consorts residence are interesting as they were vents for the underfloor heating!Anyway, give several hours, most of a day over to explore this magnificent palace complex. 5 stars just doesn't seem enough to give."
Quick Cultural Experience,As I was travelling for business I did not have much time to sight see. My colleague took me to the palace to breathe in some Korean heritage. It was a lovely experience and I learned a lot about Korean history in a short (1 hour) time. Glad I didn't miss out!
Changing of the Guard here,"We went on a Thursday morning in May and it was not too crowded. This is the largest of the Seoul palaces and there is much to see in this restored palace compound. The changing of the guard ceremony is in the area where the tickets are sold and happens at 10:00 and 2:00. It is quite colorful and is more than just a changing of the guard. Inside the grounds is the National Folk Museum and it is included with the palace admission. It also is a large space and we only got half way through. One could really spend a lot of time in this palace area. For us, a half day was enough but it was quite nice."
Wonderful place for visit and taking Hanbok photos,"Gyeongbokgung Palace is more like a Chinese ancient palace with beautiful scenary. If you go visit this place, you must go rent a Hanbok (Korean traditional costumes) first. With the Hanbok, you will have free admission to Gyeongbokgung Palace. There are many beautiful spots for taking nice photos at the Palace with Hanbok. "
One of the top places to visit is Seoul!,"If you are a first time visitor to Seoul, this place is a must. Rent a hanbok (traditional Korean outfit) from nearby venders around the palace and be a Korean for a day. I personally think everyone looks good in hanbok. There are free English tour of the palace and it is well worth your time if you want to get a glimpse of Korean history, politics and culture.Don’t miss the changing of the guards ceremony and this place have very festive and positive vibe."
The epicentre of the 3 main palaces in Seoul,"Regardless of the crowd, I still can feel the traditional vibe of ghost of its past. I thank anyone who were wearing hanbok(s) [The traditional Korean attire]. The palace was just okay though but the pillars were still in good structure and gives me the chance to enjoy the scene where the girls in hanbok are just so suited with the palace's pillars, just like what I always see in the historical Korean drama. Apart from that, the change of guard is also a must watch and it is pretty colourful."
Nice and cute ,"It is a great place to visit to connect with nature, it is safe and quiet, good option to get away from the noise of the city. Visit it comfortably birng water and camera. Good spots for photos. "
Top attraction,"this wasnt busy when we went,. Noon on a weekday. The palace is largr than life. So beautiful and people are dressed in their authentic korean wear (free entry if you have th dress code). But we paid some 3000 KRW to enter. spent about and 1 hr taking some pictures. amazing experience"
A must visit place for the 1st timer in Seoul,What else should be explained? All tourists must go to this place if they visit Seoul for the first time. Do not miss 'Changing of the Royal Guard' ceremony when you visit here.
Great location!,"This is a very beautiful palace, easy to stroll around, with many people dressed in traditional clothes adding to the charm of our photos. The changing of the guard is very simply done but with great honor and punctuality. Sadly, the tourists are all over the place and hardly notice this important tradition, but I am very pleased to have witnessed it. My only wish is that each building have a sign, in English (and other languages) to describe it's purpose. That would be a very useful addition."
Exciting historical palace,"Was amazing entrance to the palace, the change of guards took place just inside the gate. Inside the palace ground, are the National Palace Musuemof Korea and the National Folk Musuem. There many interesting and architectural parts of the palace for their different usage. Within walking distance to the other 3 palaces. Amazing mountain back drop frame the Gyeongbokgung .Palace. Was extremely busy on weekends, avoid it if possible."
History and Architecture,"Built in 1395, Gyeongbokgung is the largest and most important royal palace of the Joseon Dynasty. It was a good experience to take in all the history and architecture of the buildings that comprise the palace grounds. We rented traditional Hanbok at a nearby store for a more Korean historical experience. We were pleasantly surprised to learn that entrance to the palace is free if you wear Hanbok. Many spots within the palace grounds are Instagram worthy."
Beautiful iconic Korean Architecture ,This place is beautiful with all iconic ancient Korean architecture. You can take tons of photos in every corner. You can enter free if you wear Hanbok 
A nice day in the palace.,"A nice walk amongst the buildings of the main Seoul palace. The main problems that I faced while in Seoul are the following : A) if you have been in one palace, then they all look alike, B) they are not the actual buildings they have been restored or completely built from scratch. Still the amount of work and maintenance is astonishing. Also nice if you are there to watch the guards change which is also explained in English. Quite huge walk and might have helped taking the English tour which is available free thrice a day. But on the other hand, not sure if I could have stayed with the tour for the whole 20+ buildings. If you are going in the palace on a sunny summer day of Seoul, do make sure to have a fan (hand fan, battery fan, etc) and some shade provider (hat, umbrella, etc). "
Lovely.,"So serene and beautiful. Tons of foreigners wearing rented hanbok were fun made the dusty grounds very colorful and complimented the gorgeous buildings. Wonderful history lesson. The folk museum is right next door, too. Also well worth it. "
Layover visit,"We went to the palace during a long layover in Korea. I was initially hesitant as I was hoping for some shopping instead but ultimately I really enjoyed the visit. For US tourist, I would not even think of going here without a local guide. We saw many tourist trying to listen to our guide as they had no idea what they were looking at. Worth the trip . . ."
Witness the changing of royal guards ceremony,"If you only have time to visit one palace, I recommend this one. It is the largest of the 5 palaces and most impressive. Expect this palace you be crowded. Many female visitors are wearing the traditional dresses, which are great for photo shoots. Palace compound is huge, with many halls, rooms, quarters, pavilions etc. I spent about 1.5 hours exploring this compound.Time yourself to witness the changing of royal guards ceremony daily at 1000hr and 1400hr. Ceremony is held at the public square in front of the palace entrance. Hence, you can even watch this ceremony without purchasing the palace entrance ticket. If time permits, you can also visit the 2 nearby museums which are free admission, ie National Palace Museum of Korea and the National Folk Museum."
straight out of a historical drama,"We went in for free because we were wearing hanbok. The palaces were well preserved. We did not find the main palace though, maybe because of the ongoing constructions. And the hanbok was a bit hot so we just left after we took some pictures. I am definitely going back there on colder days."
Wonderful Palace With Lots to Experience,"It was close to 20 years since I visited the palace for the first time and the government has done a great job in continually restoring the structures and grounds that originally were part of the expansive palace. Knowing this would be the most popular palace to visit, we avoided some of the expected crowds by arriving at the opening. Adults were 3000Won while our teens were 1500Won. The main buildings that were most interesting to us were:Geunjeongjeon - Large, elevated hall where the king greeted his subjects or guests. Visible from the outside was his throne and ornately painted ceiling and beams. This was the first building seen and most popular with the visiting crowds.Gyotaejeon - This was the queen's quarters but the garden in the back with chimneys was more interesting. While not currently landscaped, I could see how it would have been a scenic getaway for the queen from the rather plain palace grounds.Gyeonghoeru - The royal banquet hall was a two story building supported on massive stone columns was but only visible from across the pond. This was a popular backdrop for many tourists photos that day.More buildings that what I originally remember went on and on including one for the queen's mother, crown prince, and library. Our last stop was to see the Hwangwonjeong which was built on an artificial island and supposed to be quite beautiful but unfortunately was under reconstruction so all we got to see were the workers and a larger wall.We came back to the main courtyard to witness the colorful changing of the guards ceremony. Periodically, helpful announcements were broadcasted over the PA system to explain the activities or significance. This time, I viewed it from inside the courtyard where I witnessed more activities than previously from outside the gate (though having that backdrop was good for photo ops).After the ceremony ended, we visited the National Palace Museum which was on the otherside of the courtyard wall from the ceremony. That was a good escape from the heat as the day warmed up."
Amazing!,It's like a picture comes alive... it is nice how the culture was preserve in vast metropolis.. Walking around coz there are different things that you can see and explore.
Fantastic,"A must visit! Don't miss the changing of guard show twice a day. Cross the street and visit the Gwanghwamun Square where you can see King Sejong statue and visit the little informative museum. Free, informative and a nice respite from the heat."
Short stop,We made a short stop and just took pictures outside the palace. It is nice to take picture with the palace as the background. The palace is also easy to reach via train. 
Good Show,"During the Korean Civil War (1950-53), Hanseong (Seoul today) was changed hands four times and everything in the City was destroyed by Air Raids and Bombs including the Palace of Chosun Dynasty.. The Main Gate of the Gyeongbokgung Palace was also totally destroyed. Now, the main gate of Gyeongbokgung Palace was rebuilt according to historic look and an tourist attraction event was performed at the Square behind and before the Palace. It is the Gate Guard Rotation Ceremony Show. Everyday, except closed day, has two sections. Morning section at 10 am and afternoon section at 2 pm. No admission fee necessary. Be reminded that you shud come before commenced otherwise you can not enter the Gate during the show. For preview, you can check the >30 seconds videos at map sites of Gyeongbokgung Palace Korea and Gwanghwamun or 12 minutes video at my tube.One very generous move here is free admission to the Palace for all elders of 65 and above, including foreighners."
Proud of Korea,It is a must visit place in Korea. Visitors can experience by getting wear traditional handbook. Folk museum and traditional village near by also attracted us lot. Thank you Seoul.
Hanboks,"Right place for a nice walk and to admire a lot of people wearing the traditional hanbok. It's the main Palace of the city so you should not miss it. If you are familiar with Asia and mostly with China, you will feel as you've been there already... "
Beautiful Palace - in town near City Hall,"This is a beautiful palace on large grounds, housing other temples and museums. One of the central spots to visit. Korean youth often visit in traditional costumes. You will want to plan most of the day to visit here and its associated attractions."
A MUST VISIT ESPECIALLY FOR THE CHANGING OF THE GUARD,"This is the largest and most spectacular of the ""Five Grand Palaces"", and we consider it a must stop in Seoul. If at all possible, visit this site when you can experience the Changing of the Guard (morning). This is a magnificent event--you will take more photos than you ever imagined. This was part of our tour, and it paid dividends to have a guide."
Place you need to see,"The views are amazing !! Good exposure to local tradition and heritage.You must wear a HANBOK! go for the theme hanbok which you can get for approx 30$You get free entrance to the palace of you do so, but it makes you feel like your in a movie or in a princess movie "
Extended weekend sightseeing,"If you want to see a Korean templethings, this would be Your place to visit. At the time of our visit, there was things under maintenance, but it did not bother too much."
Palace,Find guard changing period and go. Huge place so be prepared to walk.A lot of shops nearby for food. 
Outdoor activity,Place to learn korean royal familyOutdoor activity bring umbrellaGood to see people wearing hanbok3000 won for admission 
Excellent ,Main tourist attraction in Seoul South Korea.Palaces history is so interesting and beautiful stroll around. Lots of historical sites. Must visit if in Seoul. Love the tourists in their traditional dress.
Great site to visit in Seoul,This is a great Palace to visit. Palace's history and architecture are great. Visit early in the morning to avoid the heat and crowds.
must go for first timer!,"go with hanbok, then you don't have to pay for the entrance fee. yes, although the fee is cheaper than renting a hanbok, i think you'll feel more in place with hanbok - since many are also wearing them! the place is beautiful, although you might need more time to walk everything - but 2 hours is suffice for phototaking!"
Best of the best . . .,"Of the Joseon Dynasty in Seoul, this is by far our favorite -- though the signnage is less than ideal. Some of the buildings were undergoing renovation and there was no mention until one arrived at the purported location and all that was visible was a wall. But the grounds extensive -- and there are a variety of buildings. If one is only going to a single palace, I would suggest this is the one to visit."
"Vast, Amazing","If you want to know about history and see it first hand, this is the place to visit. It has very interesting story and you will be wowed with its historic sites, buildings and the surroundings. A must visit."
Interesting place,It is within walking distance from our hotel. Vast area and interesting place for a visit. Hop on hop off bus goes to this place. 
Must Visit,My friend and I enjoyed our visit here. I would definitely recommend joining one of the free tours. We caught the end of the free English tour and it was helpful for understanding what we were seeing.
Changing of guard ," The “military training” at 9.30 was cancelled because it was muddy. But the kids enjoyed seeing the procession. If u arrive at the area early enough like 8.30, u might hv time to explore the Hanbok rental shops that might be open and dress up before the procession. Note that the ground is not very stroller friendly. "
An important destination site,This place is well worth a visit—an important historical site. Grounds are well cared and buildings are really impressive—especially the main throne building.
Must see,"Take a whole day to explore this impressive place. There are so many different parts you can wander for ages. Kids can run free to their heart's content which is an extra if you are travelling with children. Make sure to see the change of the guards ( a few times a day).Gyeongbokgung palace is located in the center of Seoul and easy to acces. Bukchon Hanok Village, Insadong and Cheonggyecheon are in walking distance."
Beautiful at night,"A must see for anyone in Seoul. Walking through the palace gives an impression of what 14th century high society in Korea was like. If you are not coming with a guide, go on line and read about the history and locations within the palace for a forfilling experience."
Changing of guards,The palace is at the end of a long boulevard and located in front of some nice hills. Good for photos and watching the changing of guards.
Reminded me of Forbidden City in Beijing ,Beautiful old Palace with both striking buildings as well as gardens and ponds. Try to see changing of the guard (several times daily). There is a free English tour of about 60 minutes which is very worth while. Entrance also includes Folk Museum with lovely exhibits of daily life of the period.
Visiting in Summer ,"I went there early to avoid the crowds, but there were still too many tourists around the main palace. I recommend you keep walking inside, there would be more peaceful and you can enjoy your time there "
Great Experience,Located in the heart o Seoul and easily accessible by subway. You can spend the whole day wandering around the palace. Do catch the Palace Guard Changing Ceremony.
MIni Forbidden City,A very lovely and historic place. Full of wonderful images and architecture this is a must as are the other Palaces of Seoul
Heart of Seoul,"Gyeongbokgung palace is located in the heart of Seoul. It is super easy to access and there are many things that you can enjoy around the palace. You will see many people wearing hanbok which is a traditional clothing of Korea and it is free to enter the place if you wore hanbok. There are many cafes and restaurant around area. you can walk to Cheonggyecheon, Myeongdong, Insadong or Bukchon Hanok village from the palace. "
An entire day to wander about.,"Rather impressive and you can wander for ages. Would be a great place to let the kids run. Be warned, not much in washroom facilities. Could be improved be have period enactors."
Relaxing and peaceful place,"there's 2 different areas and both charge you 3k won each, though it is really worth it, or way better.especially garden and pond area was great, must see place in Seoul"
spectacular Palace - MUST see!,When you visit this palace make sure to be there in the morning to see the change of the guards at 10.00 - then take enoug htime to explore all the different bulidings it has to offer. Crowded place but worth it.
Traveling to see the palace in Kdrama's,"The first time I visited the palace was in 2011 to see the residence of Prince Gian and Prince Troy of Princess Hours. NOw that I'm back with my son, we got to discover more about South Korea through the museum and writings about the palace. We toured on our own and it was a warm day so we spent only a few hours here. It was really wide and we got to cool down while we explored the museums in the area.If in Korea, it's a must to see this beautiful structure and I'm glad they preserved the old buildings for us tourists to see,"
"Quite decent, but nothing spectacular","If you’re into history then this place is a must see, if you’re not then you’re better off visiting somewhere else. Tour guides will be provided if you’re keen on knowing more about the history of the place on a timed basis. If you’re visiting on summer, prepare some shades or else you will be fried by the hot summer sun. There are some spots that will only open a few times a day, so if you want to visit a particular area, get your schedule right before visiting. "
Gyeongbokgung Palace,"Firstly, the entrance tickets are very affordable -- W3,000 for adults and W1,500 for children up to 18 years old. These low entrance prices make the visit worthwhile to learn about the place and take photos. And a tourist has to take photos, right? Secondly, anyone can gain free entrance by wearing a traditional Korean costume, which can be rented from stores across the main gate of the palace (free entrance in other palaces too, while wearing the traditional Korean costume). This makes your selfie photos inside the palace even better :). Thirdly, the place was lightly filled when we came in on a Saturday late morning. Stay about 2 hours minimum, about 3 hours maximum."
First and Largest,"This was the first, largest and the main royal palace of the Joseon Dynasty. It was destroyed during the Japanese occupation and has taken much time and effort to be rebuilt and restored. The Changing of the Guard happened while I was there at about 9:30am. Free admission to even foreigner seniors. Many of the girls and some boys even wore the hanbok costumes for Instagram photos. From here one can go to the Folk Museum and then on to Bukchon Hanbok Village and then the Chandeokgong Palace which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Expect to spend many hours exploring this whole area as it is well worth it. Moving on from there take in lunch on Insadong Street and browse the shops. This will be such a day well spent in Seoul."
A MUST SEE,You cannot come to Seoul and not visit here. A must see. Gives you a great history of Seoul and you get to see how Royalty lived centuries ago. 
Holiday ,We visited this palace. This is by far the biggest palace so be prepared to walk a reasonable distance to cover most of the area. A lot of the buildings are very similar in style and it is interesting from a historical view. There was a changing of the guard which was colorful. Take a bottle of water as there are only a couple of places in the palace compound to get drinks. Worth the visit. 
Join the free guided tour ,This was built 6 centuries ago and is a really impressive palace in the centre of Seoul. The place is huge and can get quite sunny with little shade so don’t forget suncream and water. There are guards at the gate to look at and pose for photos with. We joined a free guided tour in English which started at 1:30 (they have some more but unsure on the times). This was really useful to tell us about each palace building and point out things you may have missed otherwise. It was hard to believe this is right in the middle of the city! Huge open space with big lavish palace buildings.
Grand palace,Nice and ancient grand palace of Joseon Dynasty of South Korea. There are more other palace that should be visited. 
Korean History !!,A MUST visit to Gyeongbokgung Palace. The grounds have been restored. The Changing of the Guard. Highly recommended. 
Amazing visit,A must go if you are a history addict! The museum offers free english guided tours at selected timings and the guide is very informative and lovely! Try to go before 9 am to get the tickets and roam around before the first english guided tour at 1030 to avoid the scorching hot sun later in the day during summer. The palace gets rather crowded and becomes difficult to take a good photo without other tourists in it. The palace is very well maintained and many areas worth exploring after the tour. One of the perks of wearing the Hanbok to the palace is that you get free entrance into all the palaces. Do note that this palace is close on Tuesdays.
A great Korean palace experience!,My family visited this palace and had a good experience exploring it. The palace covered a big area. Be prepared to walk a bit if you intend to cover every bit of it. Palace is easily accessible as it is located near to a Seoul Metro Station (Gyeongbokgung). You will need to purchase tickets to enter the palace too. 
This is a must in Seoul,This place was incredible. It was huge and incredibly maintained. We had gone during winter and there weren't too many people and so we were able to really walk around comfortably away from crowd. It was cold in the winter -- just as a precaution. There are nearby stores that rent out traditional Korean clothing for those who want to take pictures; this was very common.
Historical site-wear a hanbok!,"If u wear a hanbok to this place, your entrance fee is waived. Yes, I know the hanbok rental cost more than the entrance fee lol, but it’s the experience that counts. Overall a very beautiful place though some of the renovations were quite obviously of recent make. But it doesn’t detract from the beauty of the place. "
Very nice place,"Feel very humble inside this place, but it’s crowded and sometime hard to move or take pictures at the same time"
Not-to-be missed Korean treasure,"We really liked that the Palace provided free guided tours in English which helped us learn and understand the different structures within the complex, and the life of the Korean royals back in the day. This is especially interesting to those who watch K-Dramas."
Very nice,"One of the key cultural attractions of Korea in my opinion! There are many shops around the palace that rent traditional clothing especially to go to the palace, so that's what I did (foreigners are wlecomed to do so!). I loved walking around the castle and taking pictures. There are many tourists inside the main court but of you venture into the gardens behind the castle it gets less crowded. "
The Pearl Seoul.,Feel the pulse of the bustling capital of South Korea. This picturesque palace is the first royal palace built in 1395 during the time of the Joseon dynasty.
Beautiful palace,Really beautiful palace. Worth visiting while in Seoul.beautiful buildings and gateways. Clothing hire available. Wonderful architecture.Had a lovely walk around the palace grounds
Korean history on display and at it’s very best.,"We visited on Memorial Day. So everybody were out in their traditional hanboks, plus the Honour Guard really complemented the traditional pageantry.A must visit when in Seoul.Korean traditional architecture at it’s best, set in beautiful, extensive gardens."
Walking tour with lots of photos,"Still one of the places to visit when you are in Seoul. The palace is so intricately made and the mountain at the back is so amazing. However, it is so big but there is only 1 or 2 toilets nearby."
Wonderful large palace,"The original palace dates back to the 1300s but various invasions by the Japanese in the 1500s, 1800s and 1910 has meant a lot fo the original palace has been destroyed. Much of the palace is reproductions of the original buildings but the architecture is still very impressive. Be equipped with walking shoes and headwear as the palace is quite expansive and exposed"
Worth a Visit,"We visited the palace on the last Wednesday of the month, so the admission was free. However, a fee is charged for the guided tour. The palace area was large. There were many tourists wearing Hanbok at the palace. We saw the changing of guard ceremony. There is also a cafe that sells snacks and souvenirs in the palace area."
beautiful,"only issue was that wehn we there, they were preparing for some sort of conference, so missed the photo with the reflection!"
A big palace in Seoul,It’s a big place with long heritage and old construction building. But I have been to Beijing Forbidden Palace. The construction heritage and treasures of this palace just can’t compare to that
Beautiful! ,"We had a beautiful and enjoyable experience here. Rented a hanbok from nearby and took photos and videos in this Unesco heritage site. It was a really nice day. Come with a full stomach as food is not allowed inside. Or have snacks outside by the exit before or after. We enjoyed the dumpling shop and CU store, in our hanbok :-) Well kept and beautiful Palace. Staff in Secret Garden was kind and helped us on our way, especially when we were last in the group. Thank you for the English conversation and encouraging words to us as we walked up and down and climbed the steps. "
Big palace indeed,"Saw many local and tourists wearing the traditional costumes and indeed they brightened up the whole place, which was just ancient buildings. And it is amazing to see how the building was built with small caving like holes for firewood so that the whole building could be kept warm during winter time. "
Specky!,Love the architecture and colours on the palace . It wax good to see the guards in traditional dress. There are also a lot of ladies dressed in hanbok. 3000 Won entrance fee. Souvenir shop and cafe off to the side.
Wish it could be original,"this is a huge space with beautifully reconstructed gates, temples, and recreation areas. If one rents a native costume and wears it into the grounds, admission is free. Many tourists do this and it adds a flair to the grounds and they all seem to be enjoying their moment in native dress. It is a fairly large site and one can spend a great deal of time there or one can see the highlights in about an hour plus and move on. I highly recommend visiting."
History of palace,Nice taking photographs but long walk from station. Many people wearing the Hanbok. Good for children to understand their culture. 
"Vast complex, interesting rituals","I arrived in time to watch the changing of the guard at the entrance. It's long, involved and colourful. It's a busy place but there's lots to see. I joined a guided tour and am glad I did as it is vital to understand the place.There were a lot of tourists wearing hired traditional costumes wandering around adding to the colour. "
Good place to visit whilst in Seoul,Very clean area and can get very crowded during weekends. Good for photo shoots. Entrance is free. If you want to rent the Korean traditional costumes it is readily available near the palace before entry and very cheap as well.
Worth a visit,If you are looking to see a bit of history in Seoul the palace is worth a visit. Make sure to be there for the changing of the guard at 2pm. The Palace museum next to the actual palace is also very interesting.
Felt like stepping into History.,"I’ve watch many period dramas, I’ve read quite a few books on Korean History and always enjoyed documentaries in regards to the history of Joseon Dynasty. But to walk through it, to sit within the palace walls and have tea with dessert really made my knowledge come together."
History,To get the full appreciation of the site one needs to walk through the entire grounds and visit the museum. The Palace really shows a lot of Korean culture. We ran into a few groups of Korean students outside the Palace which put us in the right mood from the beginning.
Expansive,"The entrance, main palace and the palace museum are a must see (KW3000 entrance fee). The changing of the guards is an added bonus if you happen to be on time for the event. Note that the palace is expansive which require a lot of walking on stone path and gravel. There are not much shaded tress and places to rest expect around buildings. So an early morning visit is recommended. I made a reservation for an English guided tour of the Gyeonghoeru Pavilion only be disappointed as the tour guide decided to conduct it in the local vernacular. I did inquire though as she stated that she can give me a 10 minute English guide after she is done with the group but left before she finished."
The first of a few Temples visited,"Visited The Palace on our first day in Seoul. It is a beautiful place to visit, but I was saddened to read it’s history as we walked around. So often I learned about the demolition of Korean historical / sacred buildings being destroyed by enemies throughout the centuries. This Palace had been greatly recreated in recent years. Having said that the grounds are definitely worth a visit, tourists can hire Hangbok ( traditional costume) to wear and visit the palace in and many do and take hundreds of selfies. There is also a Changingof the Guards at certain times. Very colourful. "
Well worth a visit,This palace was very large & a bit hard to finish the tour but it's very good. The palace was informative & interesting stories about the culture & history of Korean!
Historic,"Worth the visit, easily accessible from train station.Could spend the day here and nearby villages. "
Amazing,Beautiful ancestral place.Having a tour guide to fill you in about all the history is great. Would recommend this to anyone visiting the area.
Beautiful Palace and Grounds,"Must see buildings, water garden, and crowds all dressed in traditional Korean costumes. Enjoy the Folk Museum within."
Nice walk,We went through the palace fairly quickly because there were so many people when we were there. I think school field trip was happening and there were tons of kids everywhere. It would have been nicer if it wasn't so crowded.
Beautiful,"Free entry on Wednesday is a bonus but either way the grounds are extensive and beautiful with palace complex, craft shop and museum all in one spot. Great way to spend an afternoon. I shall return in order to see the changing of the guards."
Must visit. Do join the free tour offered.,"We arrived at about 10am and found out that there is a free english tour at 11am. So, after walking around a bit, enjoying the view, we waited for the tour. There was about 30pax waiting for the tour to start. A lady dressed in a lovely hanbok gave us a tour. We enjoyed the tour a lot because the information provided about the palace were very interesting. You will appreciate the palace structure, architecture and culture better. The walking tour took 1 hr and after that, we were free to roam around the palace. Very enjoyable tour, highly recommended!"
Traveling,"My traveling to south korean finally completed by visit palace. A very great experience to enter the palace wearing hanbok, felt like a princess for a day. This palace has a huge areas, hence it might be exhausted to look around yet so fun.So guys if you have chance to come to korea, you must be come here."
A must see,"Beautiful traditional palace of the last ruling dynasty. The free guided tour was great with explanation on the architecture, history and culture. Recommend doing it at the beginning if your trip. "
Very nice but busy,"This place is huge and it's a maze inside. But it's fun to walk around and especially the pavillion on the water looks great. It was really crowded, though."
A must visit place.. Majesthic palace!,"A wonderful and huge palace to visit, the place is very wide and i guess it will take almost few hours to complete the whole place to visit. This is one of must places to visit. There are Museum, park, lot of unique buildings (palaces), kids zone and many more. You will spend almost half day or even full day here...."
Beautiful palace worthy of a visit. Can get busy.,"Being one of the prominent sites for tourists, Gyeonbokgung can get very busy. Try to time your visit to see the changing of the guard - it's actually quite impressive. There is no charge to watch the changing of the guard, but if you want to go inside the palace there is a small (not unreasonable) fee. Make sure you find a spot in the crowds near to the roped off area so that you can see what's going on. The palace grounds are vast. After visiting the buildings closest to the entrance, keep walking to see all the buildings behind. You'll find you get right away from the bulk of the crowds and can better enjoy the ambience of the place."
Massive,A massive complex which was a great experience. Surrounded by lovely grounds and the wonderful guards display. The guards seemed to change on the hour. 
Pretty Hanboks everywhere,wonderful experience seeing all the people in traditional hanboks everywhere at the palace grounds . A place one should not miss.
Delightful ,"Beautiful, peaceful!! So amazing to see everyone Dress up and take photos in traditional garb.Adorable, mothers and daughters, girls, boys and young families all done up.. so stunning. It’s a large enclosed palace grounds with loads of history and traditional Korean culture to take in.. cheap to get in and lots of ground to cover, perfect for a long stroll through time and a must if your visiting Seoul!!! Right downtown "
Palace which is worth a visit even when raining,"Put on traditional costume to get free entry, and be photographed at your best ancient look! Spend at least 3 hours there as we did, and we also had a volunteer guide (a high school English student) showing us around."
A must visit tourist attraction - The biggest main palace in Seoul,"Although not the most attractive, Gyeongbokgung palace is the biggest and the main palace in Seoul. So, ot is a must visit tourist attraction. Very crowded all the time, free entrance for visitors wearing traditional korean dress (Hanbok), that can be rented near the palace. Quieter areas are the walls surrounding the palace, with the pillars making the colorful walls and ornate ceiling beams more attractive for photos (instagram). Changing of the guard around 11:00am is also an interesting attraction to watch. "
Can spend and entire day here!,"This place is just gorgeous. You have the option of taking a guided tour but I opted to just wander around on my own. Signage is in Korean and English and there are printed guides in several languages. If you want to stick to a set time frame take the guided tour, but note yours in your language are limited to specific times of the day and the tour will typically last an hour to an hour and a half. I personally had fun wandering at my own pace and ended up spending several hours walking, viewing, thanking photos and videos, sitting and people watching, etc. it’s just a beautiful setting and experience."
Great walk around the palace,"This palace is one of the best ""parks"" to walk on a spring daytime. Good architecture and nature combined. "
Walk in costume!! ,The best way to see this place is to rent a korean costume !!You will be able to take great pictures!!
May 2018 warm day trip to the palace,"Very good palace overall~! It was May 2018 when I went there for the first time. Lots of people around this area because it was the main city centre. The changing of the guard is around 14:00 therefore, you should make good use of your timing if you wanna see the changing of the guard. The black shingles of the palace is a close resemblance of the Chinese palaces in Nanjing. Along the way, there are tons of Korean BBQ restaurants there and also the city hall with the I Love Seoul in the Garden! It's beautiful."
Interesting Sightseeing Stop,The gate itself is impressive and the grounds are well with the entrance fee. The most interesting quirk were the dozens of girls who bring along traditional outfits to photograph each other with their friends and take selfies. Even the tourists get into it and there’s a costume hire place conveniently located near by. Had a lot of fun here simply people watching. 
Amazing ,"We visited the place around 1:45 pm just before the changing of the guard at 2pm. This is amazing old meets new experience. There are many ladies dressed up in their Hanbok and they make the place come alive. The entry to the place is free. It’s great for children, couples and single travellers. It’s a total must see on your visit to Seoul. Wear comfortable shoes, be prepared to walk on uneven ground, and make sure you are there before the changing of the guards at 2pm. If you want a total Korean experience you can rent a hanbok and look like a total tourist! It’s a fun experience and I recommend it! "
Learn about the South Koreans history thru this site. ,Timing here is critical if you want to see the changing of the guard. Our tour guide (VIP Travel - Susan) got us there at 9:50 a.m. It’s not as crowded in the morning and you will get a good standing spot for the ceremony. Our tour guide (we arranged a private tour thru our concierge with a car which is really worth every single Won!) showed us how they invented a heating system for their buildings to have heated floors! Pretty smart. Don’t miss the pretty garden in the back and the reason for it. You need an hour plus here to get in the ceremony and viewing the buildings. Hope this makes your visit easier!
Very interesting place,"The place is full of people from everywhere who rent a Korean traditional clothes and visit the place. A lot of happy and smiley visitors, which we enjoyed a lot."
"Well, it's a palace and it's large...","A large territory with lots of rather typical traditional buildings. Nevertheless, a great place to walk around and explore, getting away from the crowd. Talking about the crowd, we've been here on Monday, and while the main square was moderately crowded, most of the territory was not busy at all, and we could still find lots of places to take some nice pics in peace."
Wonderful,"We visited the palace with our family and it's well worth the visit, however watch out for the school children. They come in their droves, but that's not a bad thing at all. It's lovely to see children learning about the local culture. It becomes difficult to take pictures at times though."
Korean History,"A visit to Seoul should include this sight of the palace. Easily accessible by train. Cost per adult is 3,000Won unless you hire the hanbok. Takes about 30mins to see most of the main halls. Not wheelchair friendly though if one is thinking of getting in with it. Uneven rock slab surface. "
Beautiful,If you are visiting Korea you must visit Gyeongbokgung! You can dress in Hanbok (Korean traditional dress) to gain free access to the palace. There are many Hanbok rental places just outside the palace which is convenient
Must see,I went here to see changing of the guards. It is different to what I expected! There is announcements in English so you understand what is going on. If you enter through the main gate stand on the right they will go out the gate and come back in. 
Palace within Palace,Palace within palace which for this palace there is chinese character written around it and kinda confuse me but still a great place to spend time and taking memories down the road by wearing their costumes which can be rented
Good visit a must see for anyone visiting Korea,A very historic place worth the visit to learn about Korean culture and history. It is one of the must see sites in Korea 
Visit with aged parents (wheelchair),"Mr Paul Chang’s Korea Wheelchair tour was engaged for our vacation in Seoul. He is exceptionally experience and professional when it came to helping my aged father in wheelchair.His dedication and commitment to helping my father was admirable. For those who have mobility challenges and wish to explore tourist attractions with vast areas, do consider hiring Mr Chang. "
Amazing,The scale of the Palace is amazing. On the day we went there were children dressed in traditional clothes celebrating a festival
Great site,Beautiful palace. One of the largest I’ve seen. You can even dress up an the traditional Korean garb and take pictures. A lot of the locals seem to do this. Parking was easy and relatively cheap. Definite must see if in Korea.
Beautiful Sights,We visited the palaces at the end of February. It was a freezing cold day and we got to the palaces very early so that we could get in before they got too crowded with school groups and other tourists. We wanted to get the palace pass for 10000 won which would allow you to visit 5 palaces and shrines in the Seoul but unfortunately we found out that the other main palace - Changdeokgung with the secret garden - is closed on Mondays so we just decided to purchase the single palace pass. It was a lovely day with some incredible architecture and history we read from the English provided guide book. We also managed to watch the changing of the guard at around 10am which was a cool experience. There is a narrator who explains the whole ceremony in English so that was a plus. We spend most of the morning walking around the palace and also made a quick stop in the Korean folk museum which is just alongside the palace. Would definitely recommend doing both palaces if you can and coming during a warmer month where all the grass and tress have bloomed as it is much prettier during this time.
Awesome palace,Entry was cheap. Went in the weekend and even though it was very crowded but the area is more than big enough. Lots of good photo spots. Many people were getting their pictures taken.
Beautiful historical site,This palace has many buildings and extensive grounds. If you rent a traditional Hanbok costume (shops at exit 2 of the subway) entrance is then free. You can wander on your own or take a guided tour. We chose to go it alone and had a great time.
Changing of the guard is great to watch,It was a worthwhile site to visit enhanced by seeing the interesting changing of the guard ceremony and being entertained by the large numbers of visitors in rented costumes 
Amazing Palace,You will be surprise when you arrive in this place. The palace is so huge and you will feel that you live in Joseon dynasty era especially you wear tradional korea custum (Hanbook Cloth) and go around the palace. The hanbook cloth can be rented in nearby palace area.
One of the top sightseeing's in Seoul,"We took an easy walk and got several nice photos. I think we spent there for almost 3 hours. As we went there in the morning (11), we managed to avoid the crowd what came afternoon."
Good for photo,"A beautiful place one in Seoul for photo. Entrance fee is W3,000 but free for anyone who wear hanbok dress. The door close at 5 pm. Should have at least 3 hrs here. "
Wandering Soul,We got here at around 1pm just in time for the last Changing of Guards. Great to see part of Korea's history and culture. There were too many tourist at the time of our visit that it's too hard to take a photo without photobombers LOL. 
Beautiful palace but leave before 30 minutes before closing,"We visited the palace at 5pm on a Monday. It was very busy but large enough to escape the crowds in the trails walking around the gardens. What wasn't great was from 5:30pm onwards, every 5 minutes, a loud voice over a speak system would usher us to the leave the palace asap as it was closing. This was the opposite of peaceful and made us feel like we were in some kind of theme park. I understand why this is necessary with 1,000s of visitors each day but if you're looking for a nice peaceful experience, I suggest you leave enough time to escape before 30 minutes before closing."
Awesome history!,"Nice view of the palace with the old and new, the changing of the guard and many people in costumes. It was friendly with a very nice walk and we had a good time even with our 9 year old. Lots of things to see and lots of pictures to take. Very nice walk."
Meh.,"I found this place to be initially beautiful, but it's really just a place for Koreans to get dressed up in traditional clothes and use the palace for their own personal photo shoots. Fun for about 10 minutes."
Best Palace in Seoul,"This was a lovely (and cheap) way to spend a few hours. The palace and grounds are huge. Once you get away from the main palace and start to explore the grounds, the crowds of people almost disappear and it is beautiful. I liked this palace better than Changdeokgung, even though people rave about how great Changdeokgung is...I preferred Gyeongbokgung overall. One of the best things to do in Seoul in my opinion. "
Not worth the time,"The ceremonies (including the changing of guards, guard inspection, guard training) were so boring, with most of them involving a group of men walking out in a line and/or walking around in circle before walking back.Even the tour inside the palace ground and the actual buildings were completely underwhelming - especially when you've been to other palaces in Japan and China."
beautiful Korean palace,"in the center, nice for about an hours tour and photo ops. price was 200 won,we went the 1st day as an eye opener to Seoul"
Characteristic Korean architecture ,"Enjoy the great palace of Korean empire and its pharaonic buildings! Don't miss the guard change, every couple of hours in a day! "
The famously known historical palace ,The palace is really huge and you can rent a hanbok from just outside the palace side street at a very affordable rate. Beautiful place for pictures and more pictures! Be sure to catch the changing guard changing shift!
Do not miss in Seoul!,"I traveled here with a friend of mine who used to live and teach English in Korea. She took me to the palace and I was blown away by how massive the grounds are, let alone the beautiful reconstruction of the architecture (sadly, only 10% has remained to this day). I dressed in the traditional hanbok attire and got in for free (although it cost me $20 for 2 hours just for the experience, otherwise it's 3,000 Korean Won or ~$3 for entry). It was neat seeing the ""changing of the guards"" which happens every hour in the enormous entryway before entering the palace itself. We went during the off-season, but it was still packed because it's Buddah's birthday in early May, so festivals and people were abound in preparation for it. I highly recommend visiting this palace over others for those who are baffled by the options. "
"Nice to visit, very large Grounds","This was a fun place to visit but there are a lot of open spaces with nothing to see. At the time of our visit there was construction going on so it blocked off parts of the grounds but there was also some mini-experiences that you could walk through to see what life might have been like a few hundred years ago. Overall the grounds are very beautiful and it takes time to walk around them. There are lots of good photo spots and about half the people there had rented the formal outfits of Korea’s past. Cost was very cheap to get in. I will say nothing was flat on the inside, little ones that are just learning to walk had a lot trouble."
Beautiful peasful place in the middle of the city,"This a beautiful ""must see"" place to visit located in the middle of the city. Very interesting to learn about Korean history in the museum and all the houses on the grounds. Also very nice to see people dressed up in the traditional Hanbok clothing that could be rented outside the palace to give you free entrance."
Must see historical site in central Seoul,"We spent about two hours exploring the beautiful grounds of Gyeongbokgung. The entrance fee of 3,000 korean won was waived as we wore traditional Korean hanboks.It was quite crowded with both locals and foreigners, but we were able to find some quiet spaces. There is a guard changing ceremony twice a day in the main square, which is pretty cool and also the perfect time to see the grounds as most visitors will be watching the ceremony. You can also join in the free guided tours that are offered several times a day in English, Chinese, and Japanese.It was a pretty enjoyable experience, and it transitions nicely into a view of the Blue House, where the President of South Korea resides, and a stroll through the traditional neighborhood of Bukchon. Highly recommended."
Korean’s very own Forbidden City,A must go if you are a big fan of ancient Korean history. It is like the Korean version of Forbidden City. You can see many people out there dressed in traditional korean clothings.
Very beautiful but busy,"We visited on a Monday when the quieter but by all accounts more authentic palaces were closed. Gyeongbokgung is definitely a must see when in Seoul but be prepared for there to be a lot of people, especially if it is a Monday and the alternatives are fewer. Allow around two hours to make the most of it and explore north of the main compound where the crowds become thinner."
great place,It is the authentic palace of old Korea built about many hundred years ago. It is elegant and graceful. The map was very clear and divided by sections of each function of places. 
A Must See despite the huge crowds!,"Beautiful palace in the heart of downtown bustling Seoul. Very beautiful grounds but EXTREMELY CROWDED and offputting because of that. Changing of the guard is twice per day and ceremonial, rather staged and tacky in my opinion but attracts huge crowds as well. If you're in Seoul it's a must see tourist attraction...but keep in mind, emphasis on the word TOURIST! And plenty of them!"
My #imightseoulyou trip🇰🇷,It’s a nice place and too crowded. It will be nice if you rent Hanbok for all your pictures but i didn’t do it coz when i see the crowd haha nvm. It would be bice if you come when cherry blossom blooms during last week of march first week of april. All in all it’s a nice experience in seoul
Great historical visit - but quite a lot closed for renovation :(,"Family of 3 adults. Good weather! However, several parts of the Palace were closed for renovation including the Sojubang Kitchen - which was very disappointing :( However, it was also fun to see plenty of tourists dressed in the national Korean costume 'Hanbok'. They are available for hire from plenty of local 'costume' shops - and to see them just added to your imagination! Walking around is very easy and seeing the 'Guards' at the beginning with their flags flying in the wind was also lovely!"
The Palace that closes on Tuesday,"I am sure this is not the grandest or most glamorous in South Korea. I was quite disappointed as this is said to be a must when in Seoul.Once you passed through the main gate, everything seems the same in every courtyard after each gate. The central building is also quite small, perhaps the dynasty was not a big one.We paid to go in as we were not wearing their transitional costumes, it was good that the fee was not expensive."
Not worth it,Overcrowded and not free.Bunch of people dressing the same way and taking selfies. IMO you can visit other great attractions in Seoul which are all free and less crowded.There is also a lack of places to rest and get a break from the sun.Take a picture and leave.
"Forget the day tour, go by yourself!","I decided to go by the day tour, you might miss the best part of this castle. I visit two times; one time with the day tour and the other time by myself. In day tour, the guide will give you an explanation about the place, the history of the castle, and such. But then again,you have Google and every part of the castle have a short yet detailed explanation about it. Without the day tour, we can go into more places that much more interesting for an international tourist like me. Places that day tour didn't show us, and walk slower, take more pictures.Watch the time, if I'm not mistaken at 12.00 KST, they have a guard changing ceremony (show). Watch it, definitely worth of your time."
Enjoyed the changing of the guard!,Very large area to walk around & pretty much the same in each area.. bit hard to condense the tour here I guess but wished we could..
Grand Palace,A must visit attraction when in Seoul this attraction is busy with visitors everyday. One has to queue to buy tickets and this can be uncomfortably cold in March and April. Do note that seniors get free entrance - do show your passport to get your complimentary tickets into the palace ground. The foot ways are uneven and one must be sure footed to prevent any tripping. One can see many people in rented period Korean costumes around the palace ground. Do rent one if you fancy taking photos with the palace in the background (but then there may be many people in the background too).
Beautiful,"Lovely palace grounds. But they could benefit from more exhibits. The area appears big, but could be completed within a 30min walkthrough."
History,Excellent place to visit for the history of KoreaFree to enter the museum 3 floors of exhibits Easy to get to via subway
Beautiful palace especially during cherry blossom,"Second visit to this beautiful palace. The scenery is much prettier with the cherry blossom. Even though the place was crowded during cherry blossom, we able to take some beautiful photos. The entrance fee is free of charge when you are wearing hanbok, which the entrance fee is 3,000 won per person. Estimate spending time at this palace for at least 2 hours, because the area is huge."
Beautiful Palace,"We bought a combination ticket that allowed us to visit 4 palaces (Gyeongbokong, Deoksusong, Changdeokgung & Changgyeonggung), secret garden (is within Changdeokgung palace) and Jongmyo Shrine. It saved us $4000 won for visiting these places. Great values. We joined the free guided tour which took about 1.5 hours. We were fortunate to have a good English speaker tour guide. Very interesting to know the history and the purpose of each building. She also explained the building architecture, heating system used in the old days. The weather was very cold that day and raining but we still wanted to finish the tour. I definitely will recommend you to join the free tour. If not it will be meaningless just to go thru each building and you might miss something interesting. To us, is a MUST. Next to Gyeongbokong palace there is a National Palace museum. It’s free. Nice museum. "
Beautiful and traditional,Did not manage to enter the palace as it was closed to public on the day we visited. Still we got to walk around the perimeter of the palace. Lovely and beautifully crafted traditional korean architechural wooden buildings..so rich in history. What a lovely sight to see and immense in the korean culture..in this case...in their buildings such as the palace. Surrounded by charming cherry blossoms and the cool weather which makes the walk around the place even more attractive. Though it was packed with visitors..the place looks spacious and serene. Definitely a great place to relax and take beautiful pictures with a landscape so amazing to look at.
The iconic of Seoul,"Very large area... must wear a comfort shoes... the palace has a ceremony every 9 o clock. If you want to wear hanbook costume, just go outside..you will find many places rent it, worth 4900 won(2 hours) If you want to set your hair in korean style, you must pay 5000 krw. If not..just wear a nice bando..free. "
must visit!!,"for first time visitors,try renting hanbok and explore the whole place while taking pictures.its hard to beat the crowd but there are parts of the palace that are less crowded..it took us maybe 2 hours to explore this wonderful palace while taking hundreds of pictures."
Different prices for Koreans and foreigners,"If you're a foreigner, you go into a foreigner-only queue where you pay a full-rate entry price to view the palace. If you are Korean, you go into a Korean-only line where you pay a special, discounted rate. This is typical of a foreigner vs. Korean mentality you find in many places in Korea, but it was surprising to experience this as a foreigner at such a big tourist destination."
Interesting,A very interesting experience. Good value for money and very easy to get to. Beautiful buildings and really well kept grounds.
Amazing architecture with historical value,"I came here from Chunjeongno Stn, commuting a public bus. It took me only 20 minutes to arrive here. wonderful place. entrance fee just 3000 krw per person but If you rent their Hanbok , you will get a free entrance. Goodlucl"
Great place to spend a morning or afternoon,Only 3000 Won entry. £2 or $2.50 US. Very reasonable for entry to such a beautiful place. Changing of the gaurd takes place outside the charged section so it's completely free. The 10am one is less busy. Perfectly timed to then take the 11am English tour around the palace. We absolutely loved it. Informative and friendly lady who guided us around in perfect English with subtle humour also. Highly recommend
Beautiful Cherry Blossoms,"We got there by taxi and realized that because of its central location many other attractions were within walking distance. The queues were long for the entrance tickets and some people approached us offering Hanbok rentals since wearing one grants you free entrance to the cultural attractions. The rental wasn't worth it considering the starting price was 10,000 won while the entrance only cost 3,000 won. If you're going to +3 places that have entrance fees then it might be worth it there's also a penalty for late returns. Inside the Palace we saw tons of cherry blossoms in full bloom. We rushed to the front entrance when we heard the drums for the changing of the guards but we couldn't properly appreciate it since the crowd was huge and we could only watch from a distance. "
Beautiful palace,"Easy walking, beautiful surroundings you can get into palaces free if you are in traditional dress, it was lovely to see so many doing this. It was a large palace but not too crowded"
Interesting visit,"This palace is in the same grounds as the Folk museum and, luckily I visited in Springtime when all of the cherry trees were in full bloom. It was built for the founder of the Joseon Dynasty, destroyed by the Japanese in the 16th century and rebuilt in the 19thC. It has four gates leading to it, the most important being the southern gate outside which there is daily a colourful changing of the guard ceremony."
Great tour,S. Korea has really revitalized this palace since I was a kid. We took the tour sponsored by the Korea Tourism Bureau.
Wonderful experience,"When we went in December, it was getting cold but we chose to not wear jackets over our hanboks. It was the best decision! We took some stunning pictures and because it was colder, it wasn't too packed. I loved it!!"
Visit once if you have not been,"We went with a youth guide who we met while exiting the metro station. He gave us a nice tour of the place lasting almost 2 hrs. Crowds aplenty, many were dressed in traditional costumes from one of the many shops nearby. Do catch the changing of the guard."
Interesting walking around in hanbok,Was good experience to walk around the palace in hanbok and admire the cherry blossom and scenery. Have an enjoyable morning walking around with many photo taking places
"Point ""must to see"" in Seoul.","Incredible palace. Totally different, then what we have in Europe. Mistical place full of the spirit of the old times. Great initiative of the young people to be the tour guide for free and in the same time to practice English. You can rent or buy the dresses from the royal family time, walk in palace and feel like a queen or king. Fully recommended for all families."
Four museums in one,"If you love museums, as we do, this is the place to go. The main event is the palace grounds. Though reconstructed, it give you an idea of royal life. Second, on the grounds (but I don't think you have to enter the palace to get there) is the National Palace Museum, which tells more of the story about what went on in the palace. Third, and my favorite, is the National Folk Museum, also free and outside the palace itself. This is where you learn how regular people lived - clothing, making kimchi, village life, etc. Finally, tucked away in a small building on the north perimeter is a library of material about the palace and the Josean Dynasty. All the signage throughout all the museums are in English. "
Cosplay day at the palace,"The palace is huge and you can find lots of picture-worthy spots. For entrance, you ca choose to rent costumes (hanbok/traditional korean attire) or buy entrance tickets. If you choose to rent hanbok, entrance will be included already, this option however, is more expensive compared to the regular entrance fee but you get to experience wearing hanbok and you will definitely enjoy taking pictures with it. Recommended time is 1 to 2 hours depending on travel speed. "
A Large Palace,"Arrived here at 2 pm and very crowded because many visitors from locals and foreigner. Cost me 3000 Won per person (free of charge for people using hanbok). There's a guardian changing ceremony at 10 am and 2 pm. But it's not a real guardian, only some actor (but they do it very very serious and nice to watch). This palace is very large, but never empty of visitors since it's the main palace. Oh good thing is this object provide free locker where we can put our bag. It's located near from the entrance. Many people come here using hanbok (traditional clothes from Korea). Surely can take beautiful photos here."
Best,When you stay in South Korea or you planning to travel you need to visit there. One of the history palaces...
A nice morning visit,A really nice family morning visit to see Korean history and see the sights of an excellently well preserved set of ancient buildings. 
A small forbidden city in the middle of Seoul ,Very nice palace with an interesting museum describing the life of Korean people through different times. You can spend 2 hours to visit the palace and the museum. The change of the guards is a must see. The tip from our guide is to wait outside to see the guards practicing before the official change inside the palace. 
11am free English Tour,"We arrived here in time for the 11am English speaking guided tour of the palace and its grounds. Super impressive!! The tour goes for about an hour and covers a lot of the history of the sight and the buildings along with their uses. Our guide spoke good English, so you’ll have no trouble learning something from the tour. In addition to the tour, you’re free to walk the grounds for as long as you want, something totally worth doing!"
Great place to stroll around for an hour or so.,Pensioners get free entry for a start.It is a large place to walk around and see the gardens and the lake.I watched a performance by the local band and dancers which was entertaining.You are not allowed in the palace grounds so the gardens is all you get.
Palace tour,This day a lot of tourists love to wear Hanbok dress ( the Korean traditional dress) if you wear Hanbok no entrance fee to enter the palace. If you go there in the Autumn you will see some color change very pretty. One day out of the month is free to enter (Every last Wednesday of the month don't forget to bring your passport) Even citizen less than 24-year-old and people who are 65 years old and up are fee enter. Don't for get to check National folk museum of Korea.
Beautiful and elegant,Our second time to visit this palace and caught the Changing of the Guard which is a great ceremony to watch. The palace area is huge so you have to be ready to walk but on a nice spring day it was quite pleasant and breathtaking. 
Appreciation of their culture ,"Actually my 3rd visit . But this time , there is the norm to wear their traditional attire , and the entrance to the palace would be free. If you want the more good quality hanbok it is either you rent or just buy. In doing so , the government was able to highlight their culture . Many would love doing their photo ops for social media motives. Place is huge , so just causally move around . By the way , at the start of the tour is the changing of the guard . But being late in the rental leaves you with the least desired among the traditional clothes. "
Great fun seeing people wearing hanbok dresses,"Alot and alot of people were wearing traditional korean dresses, and it just made it very fun taking photos around. Great palace, with alot of people wearing traditional dresses made it complete . Loved my cruising around there...."
Great outdoor space ,I liked the preservation of their history and culture. I liked seeing locals and foreigners dressing up in their rented or purchased Hanbok . Inexpensive $5+ USD for two adults. 
Amazing Experience,"Just came back from an amazing trip to South Korea and one of the most impressive experiences was visiting Gyeongbokgung Palace. We received a discounted Senior entrance fee which can obtain by showing your passport.The palace itself is massive and even though there were large crowds, we never felt crushed due to the expanse of this palace. Perhaps the most enjoyable aspect of the visit, however, was experiencing the throngs of Korean people who dressed up in the traditional Honok attire. It was simply gorgeous and the pride in which the individuals wore there garb was evident. It truly takes you back in time when you see people in traditional dress and being on those grounds made it even more special. A changing of the guard occurs every hour and that is fun to watch as well. When you finish that, make sure to walk the grounds entirely until you get to the National Folk Museum which is also on these grounds."
Big Palace,"With a group of people who rent hanbok, we entered this palace and it's free if you wear hanbok (Korean Traditional Dress). This is the 2nd time I have visited here. The palace is so big, and we didn't get to walk around much area. It's unique that you wear hanbok and take photos in here, seems like you are really living here. You have to experience it at least once."
Quick Visit of the Palace,We had a visit of the Gyeongbokgung Palace as part of a tour. We had a quick tour of the museum and the palace grounds and the changing of guards. Would love to go back to explore the entire place.
Really nice temple ,Big temple Areal with a long history. But was destroyed while the conflicts. It’s very similar to the forbidden city in Beijing. Take a walk around and use the west entrance! It’s new and nobody’s there. Very close to the bus station with the same name. 
Shouldn’t miss in your Korean trip,This place is like one of the main places you want to see when visiting korea. Old palaces and good for picture taking. Our tour guide gave us good information of history and culture.
"Such a beautiful and historic site, but overrun by hanbok-wearing picture crazy tourists!","When I first visited the palace in 2002, I was really in awe of the beautiful structures and the history of the site. During my last visit with my family, I ended up completely annoyed and found myself hurrying through the palace. The palace is now overrun by tourists that rent hanboks and are only interested in taking their posed photos, without appreciating the beauty and history of Gyeongbokgung. Maybe this doesn't bother you, but the experience was ruined for us. I would recommend going straight to the National Folk Museum first, and then making your way through the palace. I wish that we had done it that way. "
Very interesting place,Try to go early in the day if you want to avoid the crowds. Explore the area in and around the Palace.
Nice palace,"Visited the museum. Very interesting. Next time will consider renting the hanbok and go to palace to take photos. Apparently, entrance fee will be waived. Need to spend at least 2 hours. Weather was cold in March so going into museum was a great idea!"
A step in time,"I enjoyed exploring the palace with the English guided tour. Since we were in hanbok, we got to enter the palace for free and it became much more meaningful as we learn more of the history. There were many photo opportunities and it was nice to catch the changing of guards demonstration."
Gyeonbokgung,"This is definitely one the places you gotta visit if you’re going to Seoul, is such a very significant place.You can take pictures of the guards outside the palace, it’s a very huge place where you can fetch many things, at the back of the palace there’s a huge pretty garden, looks stunning when it’s nos autumn ."
Spring Break Get Away!,"Myeongbokgung Palace is a place to see while in Seoul, you can rent traditional clothes in Habok rental store for $10 and have picture taken while inside the palace ground. Must to see is palace guard. Food is great and affordable. Close to korean Village. "
Must see!,"You must visit ALL the local palaces, they are very inexpensive (1,000 won) and you get to see some cool history. I especially loved seeing all the people in authentic dress, by the way you can rent an outfit and you get free entry to any palace."
Beautiful!,"We visited on a warm, clear day in April and the palace was like something our of a fairy tale with everything blooming and all of the people dressed in hanboks. "
Historical place to visit,It was an amazing view to visit this palace and to admire the historical story behind was really mesmerizing. The building was neatly maintained and clean. There is a museum inside which is very much interesting to see.
Historical place,"This Palace is one of the most popular historical places to visit in Seoul. Some korean dramas have shot scenes here too. There's an entrance fee if you're not wearing a hanbok (traditional Korean clothing). I recommend renting one, I think it adds up to the experience. And lots of tourists are wearing hanbok there when we went there."
History and Scenery,"If you are interested both history and scenery, this is the place to go. At 11am you will be able to witness the guard changing at the front of the palace. Besides that, you are also able to do traditional rental dress at the nearby village. At Spring time, there are lots of sakura flowers around the palace area. Walk further in at the nearby museum, if you are lucky there will be some performances"
Absolute Must See,"Beautifully landscaped, older structures, and beautiful views of Seoul's prominent mountains. We were lucky to visit on a pleasant autumn day, plenty of blue sky and sunshine. It was great, very memorable.We took the free tour, in English. The guide pointed out several interesting smaller details without overwhelming us with too much information. The Palace is where I first became acquainted with Koreans dressing in traditional outfits and strolling historic places. I previously thought this was something daffy that only foreign tourists did. Nope, dressed in traditional vestments is how MANY Koreans experience their own heritage. That was impressive.The Palace is significantly smaller than the Forbidden City in Beijing, which means you can see it all in a morning or afternoon. As an added plus, the back gate of the palace opens up on South Korea's Blue House. It was amazing to see the history of the Palace and the present seat of Korea's political structure."
Marveling at History,"This may be my second time to visit Gyeongbukgung, but the wonderfully preserved remnants of the Joseon Dynasty is still breathtaking. In stark contrast to the sweltering heat I experienced during my first visit; the chilly winds of early spring were the ones which accompanied me during this visit. During my first visit, our sole focus was looking at the changing of the guards ceremony. In this visit though, the weather permitted us to take our time to go through the different structures within the compound. Due to time constraints though, we didn't have time to check out the National Folk Museum of Korea."
Lovely Banqueting Hall by the lake,The banqueting hall by the lake/large pond was the best feature of this Palace as the cherry trees were in bloom and the willows were well and truly weeping. The site overall is a pleasant spot with some nice reconstructed buildings giving a feel of how life was before the palace was destroyed by the Japanese. The changing of the guard at 10.am and 2pm is well worth timing the visit for and puts the British iof the Guard at Buckingham Palace into perspective. This is so much more colourful.
Fantastic Spring Day,We were lucky weather was perfect sun was out and the trees were in full bloom Although there were lots of people becos the grounds were huge once inside you didn’t feel the crowd at allOur family strolled slowly round and took lots of photos and just soaked in the whole atmosphere 
Must see in Seoul,"Beautiful place, but try to visit it as early as possible (opens at 09:00), because there're too many tourists later. As all palaces have sth in common, you may need to visit only one or two."
Huge compound,"Entrance fees is 3000 won per adult. Can easily spend one and a half hour walking around the palace. As it was drizzling, the imperial guards change process was cancelled. This palace is linked to the National Folk Museum of Korea. A must go in Seoul."
Fantastic rebuilding,It is amazing how they have rebuilt all Palaces and other buildings that were burned down along time ago. Must have cost a fortuna and they are still rebuilding . Use a guide to inform you.
Excellent and entrance fees is really not expensive,"I went twice as I really enjoyed the visit. 3000 KRW for the entrance fees. I was there for the change of guards and that was a must-see. There also provide free guides for English, Chinese and Japanese at specific time. You need 2 hours to really enjoy all the sites. Totally worth it."
So so,"Very disappointed. Have seen better and more luxury royal residences in China, Thailand and elsewhere. Probably a must for a day in Seoul but half an hour is probably enough. "
Beautiful!,The Cherry Blossoms were in full bloom and just added to how beautiful and well kept this palace was. This is a must see in the theater district of Seoul. You can even rent traditional dress(see picture) across the street to wear as you tour the various buildings that make up the palace area
Must visit this place!,"We were fortunate to visit here while the guards were being changed and the ceremony exceeds any other such ceremony that one typically can witness. Much grander of a scale, much more pageantry. But even if you don't get to see that take place, the Palace grounds and buildings are impressive enough to warrant a visit here for sure."
Don't miss when in Seoul,"This is the largest among all the palaces in Seoul. Two hours is not enough to cover and see this grand palace. Seeing the palace with the mountain as the backdrop was majestic. We went on a Sunday so the crowd was bigger.Tip 1 : It might be better to go on a weekday to avoid large crowd.Tip 2 : If you want to veer away from the crowd, proceed right away to the farther parts of the palace since most of the tourist remains at the front.We were blessed to witness the changing of guards at 2pm. I think they do this ceremony every 10AM and 2PM. If you want to witness a historical practice, don't miss this one. :)"
Copy of Beijing gugong,"Vast complex, can be combined with other sights, such as folk museum and Bukchon Hanok village. Transport back to city on the Hanok side."
The most beautiful palace,"We visited Gyeongbokgung early in the morning in rented hanboks therefore received free entry. You needn’t feel self-conscious as nearly every other person was dressed in traditonal dress wandering and taking photos. The palace is the most beautiful one we visited and we were able to appreciate the beauty early in the morning when there was less crowds. You needn’t have a tour as you can wander the location yourself even there there were not a lot of explanation signs. Be warned, as British tourists dressed in hanboks we were asked by many Asians for photos, so be prepared for pushy people and smile.One of Seoul’s top attractions!"
An iconic Korean architecture ,"This is one of the most beautiful architecture of Korea dating from Joseon Period. This is the main royal palace of Joseon Dynasty in 1395. Among the main point here is Geunjeonjeong, the throne hall. The Seoul trip is not complete without visiting this palace, as this palace is one of the most important palaces in Korea."
Five days in Seoul ,Easily accessible by metro from the grand ambassador hotel only four stops. Renting a Hanbok entitles you to free entry.
Beautiful,Palace area is huge. Highly recommended. Was short on time. Would suggest to keep 1 day only for Palaces..Worth visiting for 3000 K.wons per person. 
"Great Palace, must see in Seoul","Great palace to see, clean and interesting. Great place to take photos & learn about Korean history! Must visit in Seoul. Only $3,000 Won per person "
4 day city visit,"A beautiful palace, which unfortunately got caught in a fire in the 1800’s then was ruled by the Japanese for about 50 years. The Japanese tore it all down but fortunately stored a lot of the structures. They have spent the last 30 years, restoring and repair the palace, so not much of it looks very old but it is amazing when you read the history. The changing of the guard is a nice ceremony to watch. It is great to visit during cherry blossom as it all looks so pretty. "
Tour,It was great to watch the changing of the guards ceremony & to wear the Hanbok traditional dress for the occasion. Lovely photos with the beautiful palace buildings & environment. Worth the visit. 
Cultural Gem,"Beautiful palace full of cultural touches. It was amazing to see tourists and visitors dressed up in traditional clothing while walking around the sites. However, some part of the park was under construction when we went. Would definitely recommend seeing and dressing up too (as long as we remain respectful towards the culture)"
Great place ,Used Color of Korea for our tour. Can't say enough how pleased we were treated. Ms Ju and her driver Oliver were very professional and it would not have been the same without them. 
Must See!!,"This a great palace with history. It is huge and wear comfortable shoes!!! You can take lot of photos in each corner . good views , good pics and dont forget to wear Hanbok dress because you can get in there for free! "
Don’t Go on Holidays!,"Okay so! When we haven’t really considered the fact that the day when we went to Gyeongbokgung Palace was on a Holiday! The place was pack with people. You can’t take picture without people busy passing by . On the entrance area people flocked from local tourist to foreigners to students who’s having their educational tour.Most of the palace were closed, the one near it was closed that time. The palace is so big that you can just find spots for you to explore. However, popular spots are expected to be crowded. Just see my photo! ONCE AGAIN! Don’t go there on a holiday. Photo edit by my friend Trinity Uy. Thanks for the cool picture ❤️"
Weektrip Seoul,"Very interesting place to visit, most often free tours are available from cultural youth which are quite good"
Incredible Palace ,"Dont miss the Gyeongbokgung palace, the views are incredible. Check the times for changing the guards, it's a good way to start a visit."
Changing of Guards is highlight.,A interesting venue but best explored with a guide as more information about the many buildings can be explained in detail. The plaques erected all through the palace are also written in English which is great if you are not local. I was there for the changing of the guard which happens twice a day and it was the highlight.
It was lovely,The old architecture in the backdrop of a modern city is lovely to see. While I enjoyed I went and saw it I wouldn’t go again . It’s peaceful place to hang out and look around for an hour or so that was good enough for me.
Beautiful Palace,We watched the changing of the royal guards and it was very fascinating. The costumes are outstanding! We had our pictures taken with the guards too while they stood at attention. It's worth a visit if you're in Seoul!
Historic site! ,This palace is a great Korean historic site and a place that every tourist should visit. It is also the main palace in Seoul. 
Wear hanbok to get free entrance,You may spare a day to explore the whole location. Best spot is small lake (pond) inside the center area
Go early,Arrived at 9 when they opened and was able to enjoy the grounds in relative solitude along with the other early birds. By the time we left at around 11 the crowds were arriving. Amazing architecture and history especially with the hustle bustle of the city as a backdrop. Nice changing of the guard ceremony as well. 
Go for the free guided tour,"As per title, go for it - it’s free.The female guide was good and shares the history behind the Palace."
Main Royal Place of Josen Dynasty,"Like many of sites in Seoul a lot of the place was destroyed by the Japanese, A lot has been rebuilt to the original architecture, Only down side 95% of the buildings are empty, so gets a bit boring just look at the outside walls which all have the same decor. On highlight is the changing of the place guard ceremony twice a day except Mondays, If you are over 65 take a copy of your passport or other proof of age as its free entry. We also found the last Wednesday of the Month was free. Expect to spend around 1.5 to 2 hours here"
Needed more time huge complex,This is a much larger and more colorful attraction than I imagined. I do recommend visiting here in a rented Hanbok because the setting is just so gorgeous for photos and it is not an overcrowded site. However 2 hours is a standard minimum Hanbok Rental time from most shops near the Anguk subway station and it was just barely enough time to walk to place and through grounds. Rent for 4 hours! Entrance the palace is free - just walk through gate. We lucky to catch blooming cherry blossoms as well!
"Fun to See, Better with Guide to Learn the History","Always great to see history. This palace was originally built in the 1300's. We were on a city tour with a tour guide and they provided so much insite that you may have missed if visiting on your own.The buildings were built with such detail work and awesome colors. Lots of space to move about even though there is quite a crowd. There is a changing of the guard to see at specified times. Worth the wait to see it, but this is a ceremonal bit, not true militiary/security.I would call this a must see in Seoul. However, I would suggest if you have limited time, to see only one palace. The Changdeokgung Palace is almost exactly the same as this one.If you have time, exit the front of the place and walk straight out and see the statues of King Sejong and Admiral Yi Sunshin. These are two very important figures on the history of Korea.There is also a little known museum dedicated to the two of them under the statues. This is a nice secret spot to learn more history.The shops around the palace rent clothing of the era and many visitors rent the clothing and visit the palace. I am told if you were clothing from the era, you enter free. FYI, the entrance fee is very minimal.I highly reccomend visiting one of the palaces if visiting Seoul. A visit to the Buddist Temple is also a must!"
Beautiful ground-can only look on outside,"We walked the entire park. Beautiful buildings. No one there to talk about any of them. Cannot see inside at all. A few doors open to look at empty spaces with painted walls but most areas doors locked and cannot see inside. No furniture, no mats. Do not get a feel for how they lived many years ago. There is construction going on in some area which were completely blocked off. I was disappointed because I wanted a sense of how the family lived their lives during that time period. Only saw buildings. "
A historical place,"One of the five palaces in Seoul and is the largest one. Highly recommended: wear a hanbok, korea's traditional costume, while exploring the palace. Highlights: changing of the guards ceremony."
Sunday visit,We where lucky to see special ceremony what happened only once a year. The place offers a free walking tours or for few dollars you can rent the audio headset. The place was absolutely beautiful. The cherry blossoms are just starting to bloom. 
Hanbok Rental,"The palace is nice. There is an entrance fee and they have translators there so you can speak with someone who knows English. But if you rent a hanbok just outside pf the gate there is a shop and they accept credit cards, entrance is free. Rental of hanbok is 7000won for 2 hours."
Large and not much,"The switching of the guards is cool. The palace is large, lots of walking and little to see. We aren’t allowed to enter the the rooms but can see through the windows. Overall, I don’t care for it much. "
Buitiful palace!,The palace situated in heart of Seoul that you can see and feel Korean history you must visit. Also you must visit the musium right next to it.
Good place to spend couple of hours. Not a whole lot to see,"This palace has been rebuilt after it was destroyed. We had a volunteer high school student do the tour with us, she did a really good job. Unless you really care for the history and don’t have better things to do then it is good to visit. The metro line gets you there so you don’t have to worry about directions. We had to wait for around 15 minutes for tickets. But, overall, it was an ok thing to do. "
Wonderful changing of the guards,"It only costs you around $3 per entry, however if you are 65 or older the entry is free. It is also free if you dress up in national costume. The changing of the guards is great to watch. It is twice a day at 10:00am and 2:00pm. "
Beautiful!,Beautiful old charm surrounding with modern buildings in Seoul city. Gyeongbokgung Palace is very big area. Hanbok rental shops is located near to this palace.
Gyeonbomgung Place,"Our view of the places was average, nice grounds and Wednesday were free because of Culture day. It was nice to scroll on lesiure day."
Iconic experience of old Korea,"Gyeongbokgung Palace is similar to the Forbidden City in Beijing and almost as big, but it's a real pity that many of the original constructs have been torn down by the Japanese. Nevertheless the current compound consisting of original, restored and rebuilt buildings is still impressive. There are free tours available in English (and other languages), and even with 2 young children in tow we managed to pick up interested nuggets of Korean history.Tip: for a bit of fun, there are traditional Hanbok hire stops nearby - many locals and visitors alike will dress up while visiting the palace."
Beautiful palace still filled with tradition,"This palace epitomizes how the old and new blend together in modern Seoul: a sprawling centuries-old palace that is located nearby today's government complexes. The palace is a must-see at least once while in Seoul. A big plus is that it is free entry for everyone into the Gwanghwamun Gate, to witness the daily Guard Changing Ceremony (10am and 2pm daily except Tuesday), and even to enter the National Palace Museum of Korea where there are so many historical exhibits to see. You will be amazed how vast and rich Korea's history is! We did not enter the main palace grounds itself based on our time limit. It would require a nominal entrance fee which you can purchase on the spot. However, wear a traditional Korean Hanbok costume and you can enter for free! There are plenty of rentals within a short walking distance of the palace."
Thank you Korea :-),"Gyeongbokgung palace, the obvious seat of government in older times, is a showpiece for the city, staring down at the city's main avenue through the reconstructed Gwanghwamun gate, giving it the proper sightlines so important in eastern palace layouts. Being the main palace in Seoul, it features a number of displays, including performers in traditional dress showing various aspect of court pageantry. Also worth visiting is the folk museum within.The detailing and shape of the roofs are unique, and the large number of carved stone figures, some of them unfortunately encased in transparent boxes due to unruly visitors, interesting indeed. Lovely day !"
Lovely Place to take photo,Beautiful place with lots of angle to take photos. Palace guards changing ceremony and Gate Guard changing ceremony occurs at certain timings. You'll see people renting the Korean traditional costume for photos.
Must in seoul,"Very nice visit to a Palace from XIV Century from Joseon period.Try to get at specific hours to see guard change, its worth the Wait.You Can also rent a typical dress from the period and take great pics in this old and nice palace and buildings."
Must See,"Just go. You won’t regret it. Even though it is in Seoul, I don’t feel as though I am in a metropolitan city at all, was like stepping back in time. Gorgeous with so much architecture and history to appreciate. Lots of other awesome things nearby to see and do such as The Blue House (White House equivalent). Dress comfortably, one can easily spend a while exploring. You can rent traditional Korean clothing (Hanbok) to wear when you visit from one of the nearby shops. See if you can catch the changing of the guard ceremony. "
This is a must in Seoul,This is a must in Seoul. Built 25 years before the Forbidden City. It looked to somehow similar in structure. Beautiful buildings. Interesting heating systems in the ancient buildings.They have a change of guards ceremony. Amazing !!! I enjoyed the visit.
Beautiful architecture ,The first palace built in the Joseon dynasty with over 500 years history. The impressive royal culture and palace life can be experienced.
Big place to learn a LITTLE about Korean history,"The Gyeongbokgung Palace is extremely huge, similar to some of the palaces in China. There are many places inside the palace to take amazing photos. There are small signs around the palace with brief descriptions of the buildings in the palace, however, the descriptions are not very detailed and if you are truly interested in learning more about the Gyeongbokgung Palace, you should probably follow the guided-tours.There’s also a guard changing ceremony daily at 1000 and 1400 hours. The guard changing ceremony was pretty amazing, but be sure to arrive at the central area of the palace early to get a clear view of it. "
Spacious Palace,"This palace sits conveniently near the center of Seoul and is easily accessible by bus or train. You can easily spend half a day there. There are many Koreans and tourists wearing their hanbok costumes taking pictures everywhere. The area is huge and you need to buy an entry ticket. Its KRW 3,000 for adults and KRW 1,500 for youngsters. There are 2 guard changing ceremonies(at 10am and 2pm), so time your visit so that you can watch the ceremony. There are also guides with different languages at scheduled timings. "
The free guided tour makes the place all the more interesting.,"You can walk around all over the grounds by yourself and read the signs they have. But the your best bet is to take the guided tour in your language. They are offered several times a day. Check their website for the most up to date information. The changing of the guard is also a must see. Lots of people in traditional dress. Cheap to get in. Less than $3 US. Wear your walking shoes. The ground is uneven everywhere, and there are lots of steps, and a few ramps."
a place you should not miss!,"we joined the translated guided tour,and it was definitely worth it! a free locker service is also available, very convenient !"
Beautiful building & lots of photographs spot,"Great experience, has rented Hanbok and enter the temple for free. Antique building with beautiful scenery created an amazing place for photography. A must go place when you visited Seoul and you will not regret after you have visit this place. "
Seoul,Lovely part of palace. Nice place. Picturisque. We enjoyed our photos in this area. We drop by nearby souvenier shop.
Nice place with a museum,Took photos here and went to the museum to understand a bit more about korean lifestyle and culture.
Gyeongbok palace is history in Korea.,"Is a history attraction in Korea. Was aware of his ethnic culture and being in his old days. Is an old palace that still maintains it’s original condition quite well. Take Beautiful pictures. If there is a chance,should go."
Palace with many courtyards,"This was very easy to find on the train from Seoul. Large courtyards with many people who rented traditional Korean attire at the entrance and roamed the palace grounds. There’s a museum, cafe, and a separate center that demonstrated playing traditional instruments."
Extensive grounds with interesting parade,"We went on Seollal. It was crowded but because the grounds were huge, we were able to take photos and enjoy the palace grounds without fighting with people. As it was Seollal, entry is free as well! I think that arranging your visit to coincide with the changing of the guards parade will make your visit alot more interesting! Worth a visit!"
Tradition,"Beautiful place - unfortunately, they all take a selfie. on the one hand we see a lot of skyscrapers and on the other this humble side of Korea! the entrance cost $ 3 but the memories remain for a long time! we saw many traditional Korean dresses! It's worth seeing"
Amazing And Very interesting. ,"It didn't look as big from the outside as it really was. For only 3000 Won which is about $3US, it is very cheap and you can also go to the Korean Folk Museum for free which was also very interesting. You learn a lot about the Joseon dynasty. "
Great experience,This palace shouldn’t be missed even on the shortest trips to SK. They offer free English tours several times a day or you can explore on your own. Architecturally the palace is stunning and it’s neat to see people dressed up in traditional Korean attire around the palace. Your admission also covers free admission to the folklore museum. I would recommend visiting both.
Palace visit,We could feel the history of the dynasty which are kept in very good condition. Proud people of this ancient culture.
A must in Seoul,Once your are in Seoul is a must to go and visit the Gyeongbokgung Palace.This Palace is the biggest one in Seoul.Also there is a museum next to the palace.
Good place for hanbok photo taking and very relaxing,Gyeongbokgung station exit 3-1 .. there's alot of Hanbok boutiques for rental n walking distance to Gyeongbokgung very near .
Nice visit and cheap entrance fee,We spent a couple of hours visiting this palace where you can go from courtyard to courtyard to see various buildings. The queen’s quarter is interesting as well as the heating system they used in those days. There is a small cafeteria and souvenir shop within the palace area. 
best palace to visit,this is thes best place to viti. very educational..once you step in you can really feel you are there during joseon time
A MUST on your Trip to SK,"This is when it hit me that I had finally made it to South Korea. The architecture was stunning, but my favorite part was the changing of the guards- the outfits, the armor, what an experience. You can't come to SK and not see the changing of the guards!"
great place for photo-taking but boring if you are interested in the history and culture,"tried on the hanbok at a nearby rental shop and got complimentary entry passes to the Palace. It was very crowded and people were taking photos everywhere. The facilities were minimum and there seemed to be only one cafe for visitors to have a quite bite or hot drink.in my opinion, if you are interested to just take photos of yourself in a hanbok this place is an ideal choice. if you are into history and culture, i don't think it would be good . "
Spend the entire day here... ,... if you're into saegeuk.Wear a hanbok to get into characterBring a friend who wouldn't mind being your unofficial photographerWalkaround the entire palace ground (huge)Go into the Museum to read more of their History
Soak some Korean Palace vibe,"You can enter this palace if you are wearing a hanbok.Instead of entering via the main gate, we used the east gate coming from Bukchon Hanok Village."
Very interesting,"This was part of our private tour and very interesting. It was a lot of walking, as it is a big area and we have mobility issues, but it was worth it. Our guide did a very good job of explaining the various buildings that comprised the palace."
Much bigger than I expected ,"The Palace is not just one or two buildings, but rather a large complex, similar to the Forbidden City in Beijing. Lots of things to see, but not too much to do, although it’s hard to appreciate what you’re looking at when you’re not too familiar with Korean history. Luckily there’s a free English walking tour (free after having paid the entrance fee). The changing of the guards is a fun experience, and makes for some good pictures. "
"Big, very big","I didn't find it so impressive, but it's a matter of taste. A lot to walk, it's a big area. I wish more informations in english. "
Nice,So easy to get to this place and very near to the subway. This place is just beside the National Palace Museum of Korea. You also can rent a hanbok and experience walk around the palace with a traditional hanbok of Korea
Changing of Guards,The colourful event happens daily at 2pm where visitors experience live performances of changing of the city centred famous palace guards. Visitors are allowed to take pictures with the guards on duty just like the London’s Buckingham palace mannequin looking soldiers. Young Korean ladies would be seen wearing their cultural Hanbok dresses when visiting the palace area. It was a nice 12C bright sunny day during the Seoul city outing. 
"Gyeongbokgung Palace, a visit back in time","This Palace was the main royal palace of the Joseon dynasty built in 1395. The largest of the Five Grand Palaces built by the Joseon dynasty, Gyeongbokgung served as the home of Kings of the Joseon dynasty, the Kings' households, as well as the government of Joseon. Truly history comes alive with daily changing of the Imperial Guards at 10 am and 4 pm. A must see when in Seoul."
Korean Palace!,"I went with my friends and so many people were wearing beautiful Korean traditional clothes. I heard there's a place that you can rent them. Anyway, I kind of wished that they have more signs or at least have QR codes or something to explain what the building was. "
An interesting step back in time,"number one tip is to hire a Hanbok and get in for free. Loads of places to hire one, it cost around $13 for 2 hours. I hired one for 4 hours and had a ball. Being and older blondie, I copped a few stares and compliments, but had super fun. It is really a series of buildings that you wander around. Pretty wheelchair accessible, there are ramps over entrances etc. I highly recommend the museum that is attached. It is well set out and very interesting. I went with a Korean lad, but would have been fine to wander about solo. There is not a lot happening in the palace itself, more a wander through the building and complex. Still highly recommend this location."
PLEASE DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME,"We came to Seoul in Feb and were really looking forward to seeing this place. I was very glad that it only cost around 3000W/person otherwise I would just ask for my money back. Everything is fake. The different areas are rebuilt and are just new and reconstruction. You cant really get to the chambers. You will get more history and artifacts if you go to the Palace museum to the right of the main entrance and its FREE! The guard change is just laughable - the fakeness of it! The fake beards, the fake weapons... I guess it goes with the whole place."
Piece of old architecture ,"Large spaces padding every gate. Nice old wooden architecture. Be prepared to walk. Quite a lot of Korean tourists, not only foreign. "
Very historical rich place with nice views,The place has plenty of water surrounding the old unique Korean architectural buildings and thus offer great venue for photo taking.One interesting thing we observed was that some people were happy to hire traditional Korean costumes and move around the place and snapping photos in them! They did add a nice touch to the ancient surroudings! 
It’s just a simple palace.,"I have been to Japan, Indonesia and Thailand with my family... I’mSorry but the temples and palaces in South Korea are very simple."
Beautiful!,"It was snowing when we were there in winter feb , gosh this place is SO GORGEOUS! Stunning, when the floors are covered in snow. Beautiful!"
Don't miss,Big and nice place to spend 3-4 hoursYou can see the most beautiful traditional clothesand I had an opportunity to see and hear amazing traditional singers
A must visit Palace in downtown Seoul.,It's one of the most beautiful places in the Kyubgbokgung Palace. Used to be the place for receiving foreign guest and have banquet here.
Must see palace,"You have to dedicate half of your day to tour the whole palace, the museums inside and watching of change of guards.You may enter the front gate and National Palace museum (on the left side exit after entering the main gate) for free. Charges apply on the Palace entrance. All palace entrance fee are free during Chuseok holiday."
Must see,"The entrance ticket was really cheap, maybe 3k₩ , and if you wear hanbok it’s free. Which is a nice experience, especially when the weather is warm. There are many hanbok rental places around Gyeongbokgung. Going there be prepared for some walking, it’s a very spacious place. Also, there’s a folk museum inside. It’s very near other places worth visiting, such as Insadong, the Blue House and other palaces. "
"Big, nice & close to get","I was told to choose this palace if I could make just one. I am glad I followed the advise. Very easy to get there, and the experience was more than expected. I got lucky and saw the change of guards, and saw a lot (hundreds) of local people in local customs taking pictures of themselves and visiting the palace. I asked them why they were dressed like that and the answer was a tradition- loved it. "
"VISITED TWICE, NEVER DISAPPOINTED","I have visited Gyeongbukgung twice, once in the summer and once in the winter time. I personally hate cold weather, but, Gyeongbukgung is so much better in the winter time. With less tourist and less heat, you can wear the Korean traditional clothes comfortably during the winter time. "
Hanboks galore,"Definitely worth a visit if you are in Seoul. If you want a full experience, I would go rent a hanbok (the traditional Korean dress) at a nearby store before going into the palace. If you do rent a hanbok then admission is free! They have bag storage at the rental places so your outfit won't be ruined by a backpack or something. If you go during the winter, use base layers to keep warm."
Princess hours,"We felt like princesses during this time when we visited Gyeongbokgung Palace despite the cold weather we manage to stay, smile and mesmerized of the beauty of the palace and its surroundings."
Palace ,We saw the ceremonial changing of the guards. Very colorful and well organized. Would have liked to see more of the inside of the palace. 
Essential Seoul Tour,"Lovely day spent with our guide Stella & our mini bus driver. We visited Gyeongbok Palace which was amazing. Jogye Buddhist temple, dressed up in hanbok in Insadong which was fun. We got a little time to shop than we had a wonderful traditional Korean lunch. We visited Bukchon Hanok Village, went past the Blue House on our way to Bugak skyway that over looks the city of Seoul & finished in Myeongdong to shop. Stella was a terrific guide, warm & friendly, & she paced the day perfectly. The bus was clean & the driver very capable. I highly recommend this tour. "
Beautiful Palace,"Our initial plan was to wear a traditional clothes called Hanbuk at this palace while we walk around. Unfortunately, we went during winter time and I am not one to stand up against the freezing cold weather wearing only those clothes- this place is huge and you’ll need at least 2 hours to go around and enjoy the beauty of this palace. I have a good photographer (my ever so photo-enthusiast BF) so I won’t take credit on any of the pictures I’ve posted here... "
Jewels in the Palace,"So I'd say what's a palace without its crew? When we visited GBK Palace, we rented out hanbok from a nearby store so we can truly feel what's it like to live like a Korean in the past. Although it's kind of uncomfortable, it's nice to experience it while we're there. The costume for men starts at 17k KRW for 2 hours. If you opt to add a headdress, that would be an additonal 5k KRW. For girls it's a little but more expensive, but hey, girls dress more than we do. Hahaha"
Majestic,A must visit historical attraction when in Seoul. Beautiful landscape and very well kept. Many photo taking opportunities.
Great Palace / but many areas are being fixed and are cordon off for winter,"the Palace was nice with large gardens, but in winter lots of areas where cordoned off and many of the buildings where closed. The change of the guard is at 9:30 and is a very nice complement"
Tranquil and picturesque.,"If you had enough time to visit just one palace in Seoul, this would be the one. Gyeongbokgung is the main royal palace of the Joseon Dynasty. Most of the visit focuses on building exteriors, grounds and courtyard though there are some buildings where you can look in through the door and snap a few photos. Do consider the free guided tour that occurs throughout the day (1-1.5 hours) as well as the Changing of the Palace Guard Ceremony at 10:00 and 14:00. There is also a Gate Guard Duty performance at 11:00 and 13:00. And of course, you can always rent the popular hanbok attire for photo ops at nearby shops."
One of the highlights in Seoul,"the palace is large but most of the rooms are closed hence one gets to see the outer structures only. a self guide facility should be made available to understand the buildings better, fairly large and hence needs an easy 2-3 hours visit"
How did they build this,This place needs no review as it is a must see place while visiting Seoul. It is stunning and surreal. The changing of the guard happens at 10 am everyday and if you can be there at 9:45 you will be glad you did. 
Amazing!!!,"During our 5 days stay in Seoul, we actually visited this palace twice! It is so beautiful especially when it is snowing. Change of guards is amazing and the free guided tour is something we enjoyed a lot. "
A MUST VISIT PLACE,An interesting experience to experience by yourself. You can watch the Royal Guide Changing Ceremony and I was chosen to be the lucky one to knock the gong. Im so happy.
An okay palace in the midst of town,"If you've been to a few palaces in Asia and in South Korea, you will feel like you have seen it all. The area is paid to enter and there is quite a lot to see and luckily most of the displays have English so you can read about the history. However we felt that the area was a bit sparse in terms of things to do and did not really wow me compared to the other sites of Seoul. Be prepared to walk around for a couple of hours to cover most of the palace grounds."
Jus another Asian style palace,"That place a bit disappointing me. Most of buildings are basically replica and quite new. Off coutce there is reason why so, but still. Area is big and it is nice place to escape busy city. But at end of a day, it is just another Palace made for tourist attractions. "
Excellent place to learn and experience the Korean History and Culture,Majestic Palace. Enjoyed the changing of guard ceremony. Dressing in Hanbok to tour around the Palace is an experienced not to be missed!
Worth seeing,"I visited on a public holiday so there were many visitors at the time. Lots of space, artefacts, old court documents, costumes. "
Great place to visit,I was lucky enough to arrive in time to see the changing of the guard . Colourful experience . Photo op with one of the guards who looked a little scary . Lovely walking around the grounds and seeing all the people walking around in traditional dress which can be hired locally . I think there is a discount for wearing it too
Nice place but no remarkable,This is nice palace but no remarkable because their architecture is boring. But Korean advertise their culture is very good with free ticket if wear hanbok. I appreciate it
Great experience,"Great experience, the guard change is really interesting.The contrast with the modern city, build just some steps away, make it more interesting"
A Wonderful Symbol of Korea's Past,"I have been to Korea 5x now and I'm never ceased to be amazed by all the museums and historical sites! Anyway, this was my first time here and the site is quite large with expansive grounds, displays, and monuments to explore. You could easily spend a few hours here. If you're a fan of historical Kdramas, this would be a place to visit! Just to note, I was here during Korean New Year's (2/3 through 2/5?) and there was no changing of the guard ceremony. Also, aside from Myeongdong, many of the malls and underground shops were closed or partially open."
A truly free tour of a super cool place,"Our guide met us just after the changing of the guards, and took us on a full tour of the palace. She was really knowledgeable, and her English was excellent. I highly recommend this tour, and others provided by Seoul City Walking Tours as well!!"
Pretty cool ,It is not an abundance of things to do or see but it is really cheap and kind of cozy to stroll around in the gardens amongst the temples. And sitting in front of the mountains it is a pretty scenic. 
Colourful changing of the guards ,"This is my second visit. Once in summer (no shade and very hot so I didn’t walk around much). This time in winter, I was able to walk around more. The changing of the guards is every hour, on the hour and is worth seeing. It’s free. The costumes are colourful and the drums are cool. The palace entrance is 3000 won. The grounds are expansive and besides the pavilions and buildings, it’s pretty sparse. There were plenty of people in traditional costumes taking photos. There is a folk museum too but I didn’t go in. "
Nice to Visit,"You can see the culture and Heritage of Korea by visiting this place, Korean Royal Food and Traditional Dance , this Palace is near the lake and mostly crowded with travellers and visitors from various placed "
Great Palace but too crowded,Great views and tons of places for photos ... but there were too many visitors and you could hardly take nice photos ...
It's kind of crowded but good,"This one is definitely one of my favorite place during my 5 year living in Seoul. The place can be crowded sometimes but if you choose the right time to visit, this place offers a lot. They have a lot of spot where you can take beautiful pictures, and they offer a different vibes every different season. And there's also this museum inside the palace where you can learn about Korea's past time. So yeah, it's good. =DOh~! and one more thing, if you come here wearing a Hanbok (Korean traditional costume) then you can get inside here for free."
A nice place for a walk,The reconstructed site is a nice place to go for a walk but apart from the nice surroundings it lack interesting appeal.
💕,"Explored the palace twice actually. It was nice but everything is restored according to my friend. But still, it is very beautiful"
Beautiful historical,Opportunity to go back in time and enjoy the history of South Korea. Wonderful experience. Enjoy wonderful day of exploring and a tasty local lunch. Food cost in Korea is very inexpensive compared to USA. Can afford to eat out everyday.
Good sightseeing,If you are into lots of walking and in big groups will be nice. There are performances and was crowded but nice to see travellers in HanBoks. Good location to shoot documentaries and vlogs. 
Nice Palace,"Joseon Kingdom Palace. One of the nicest looking palace. This is like the miniature of Forbidden Kingdom, smaller, but you don't need to spend a lot of time visiting all the places, 3-4 hrs are enough. Better to visit around 1.30pm, and see that changing of the guard procession at 2pm and enter the palace afterwards.You can also see plenty of visitors wearing Han Bok, although mostly are not koreans. But if you manage to find a pretty one, don't hesitate to ask for a picture. Hehehe"
Amazing visit,Saw the changing of the guard on a minus 13-Celsius day but that didn't spoil the spectacle. The National Museum of Korea is right next door too and the subway stops right at the palace.
"Wow, I was impressed!!!!","I went here with my friend. It was a very nice experience. The palace is so beautiful, and there are things to do and see here too. You can do traditional arts and crafts, watch make-believe guards standing near by, and stroll along and take picture with King Sejong's beautiful statue. It is in front of the main gate, before you enter the palace. Also, you can see the Blue House from a distance. The Blue House is like the White House in the US, where the President lived and worked, or hold government meetings. It was nice to see. It is just across from the palace. I can see guards standing nearby. Pretty impressive!!! "
Fascinating. Not to be missed,"Came on a guided tour. If not must join one of theirs (English ones 11.30 & 2.30 Mar-Dec Korean ones on the hour)The history is fascinating, as is the palace.Beautiful gardens. Enjoyed the two museums as well. Loved seeing the young people of many nationalities enjoying walking around in traditional Korean dress. Very sorry I missed the changing of the guard as didn't know about it until I read a review laterCame on a ship's tour, which we all thought was very poor value, ($159) although it was easy being driven round the sights..Better to research to get the metro."
A walk in the Palace Grounds,"It was a cold day and the trees were all bare (as expected in winter) but the grandeur of the palace and the grounds around it was still impressive. Even better was the changing of the guards. If you’re going to the palace, make sure you get to see this."
A place and palace not to be missed,"Despite not being as big as the palaces in China, I still think Gyeongbok Palace is one place not too be missed when you visit Korea.We were there for only one hour as we arrived late in the day. So please check the hours of operation. They really chased you out when it was time to close."
Australia Couple,"My wife and I love attending palaces, museums etc in the countries we visit. We attended the palace and partook in the free tour. It was extremely informative and we really enjoyed it. Further more there was no request for tips or any form of payment. As the tour ended our guide thanked us for our time, wished us all the best on our holiday and then walked off. She was extremely polite and informative the entire tour and I actually felt like I wanted to tip her given how brilliant she was. I would highly recommend taking the free tour as you get so much more out of it that just walking around yourself"
Love ❤️ ,We went to the palace at afternoon with my kids they love the place and we see kids museum they love it 
Impressive,"The palace and the palace ground were impressive, just as we see them on TV. Well preserved, clean and well loved. "
Visit this if you could only pick one spot,"This was a great place to visit. At $3 for entrance fee with a free (and excellent) English tour, this is a must for all visitors to Seoul. Do take note of closing days (I think Tuesday). You can also combine the entrance fee to the other palaces for a bargain but I felt that I didn’t need to see the others after this one."
Seoul Historical Culture Must See!!!,Really enjoyed visiting Gyeongbokgung Palace. Covers a massive area so be prepared to walk and dress warm during winter . If you time it right you can watch the ceremonial changing of the guards(about 20 minutes). Also head to the back area so you can see the Blue House where the President resides. The property is kept very clean and organized. Was amazed to see the traditional dresses or “ Hanbok “worn by the female visitors. Bathrooms were spotless clean and nice. Great stop to see while in Seoul 
To do list,A historical place must visit for first timer in Seoul. Huge landscape and admiring the buildings that much influenced by Chinese.
Famous Landmark and Kdrama Shooting Site,"We took the metro and went to Gyeongbokgung Palace. Unfortunately, I didn’t rent Hanbok because it was really cold that time. It was -16 degrees Celcius when we toured the grounds of the palace. There were student volunteers who would tour you around the Palace explaining the history and the areas in detail. They are English-speaking tour guides and it’s for free. The students are training to be a teacher in the future that’s why they volunteer to tourists who wants to know the Palace’s history. The whole ground will take you more than an hour to cover. The grounds were huge and if you watch Korean historical dramas, most of the scenes were shot here (I particularly like Hwarang and Love in the Moonlight). Gyeongbokgung PalaceGyeongbokgung Station (Seoul Subway Line 3) and Exit 5.SUBWAY: 14mis: Euljiro 1 - - Euljiro 3 - - - - Gyeongbokgung"
Beautiful architecture and landscape...,"But maybe better in another season, like spring or fall. Went in December a few years ago, and the landscaping was pretty bare because of the frigid temperatures (Korea gets cold in winter), and I imagine it must be pretty spectacular in either spring or fall.Enjoyed walking around the grounds, and there are plenty of great places for photos even in the winter. Wish I would have gotten tour guide or one of those personal tour things, but was in a rush and did what I could in the limited time we were there. Would be a great place for a picnic (not sure if that's allowed though).Would definitely go back if it wasn't December."
Chosun at its finest,The architecture is amazing and well preserved its like being taken back in time or being part of an epic kdrama...but the highlight is watching the changing of guards the ceremony in itself is a definite must when visiting this place... 
History lesson,We went to palace without expecting anything and thought it will be only photo taking session but as we arrive at Gyeongbokgung subway we were approached by student who give free service of the palace tours! We were so happy and we understand more about the history of the palace. Overall a great experience visit.
Beautiful and crowded ,"It’s very beautiful place with castle and some garden. Also very popular for tourist and field trip students and kids! I saw many people wearing korean traditional dress, heard the entry fee is free if you wear those! "
Definitely worth while,"Definitely worth while to visit, staff very friendly to answer any question. Unfortunately lot of the pavilions are closed, so not much tonsee, other palace is better for this, bit nice grounds to walk around.Changing of the guards is not authentic and very touristic unfortunately. "
Under construction ,Important to note that a massive section of this is being renovated at the time of writing! Maybe if you read this at the beginning of 2019 err on the side of another palace not covered in hoarding...
Very Nice Palace,"It is a pride of our nation, But it is a shame when lose our country,But we hope it will be a lesson for our next generations."
Family tour in Korea,A Majestic Palace!! A must place to visit!!! You will be amazed of what rich history it must had held by just looking at the place and the intricate design on the ceilings and in the walls.
A taste of Korea,"One of the 5 grand palaces built by kings of Joseon dynasty, Gyeongbokgung Palace offers a good glimpse of Korean tradition and history. The complex is huge and seems to always full of people wearing Hanbok. Well worth 1-2 hour visit. Stay longer if you want to take a royal tea ceremony or learn to make rice cake."
"Enjoyable, especially changing of the guards","Large palace complex - the traditional wood buildings are beautifully painted with geometric floral motifs. The main throne room is beautifully decorated. Be sure to see changing of the guards ceremony, held twice, at 11am and 2 pm. It is a lot of fun with a lot of pageantry. The guards dressed in colorful traditional clothes, carry weapons and try to look fearsome. They are accompanied by a military band and other guards/men carrying colorful standards. The guards are very popular photo props."
Worth it ,I had a great time here it was informative and easy to get around even on a Sunday when many people visit. Be aware that the museum on the left as you enter is free (and also worth it) but there is one further in that has a cost of I believe 3000 won.If you can go in the winter you may even be able to see the frozen lake which is a great photo opportunity!
Experience wearing hanbok and watch exchange of the guard ,Your visit to Seoul Korea is not complete unless you visit the Palace wearing the traditional dress called Hanbok while walking around the Palace and witness the changing of the guard. 
Awesome! ,"I’ve been living in Korea for almost 5 years now, and I still visit the palace on a regular basis. Mainly when visitors come as a major site for them to see, but it never ceases to amaze me. It’s stunning and takes a good long while to walk around and take in the beauty, and for only 3,000₩ it’s a great deal for something to do on a low budget. "
Beautiful palace,"A beautiful palace indeed. I personally enjoy historical thing, so I was really happy with my visit to Gyeongbokgung Palace. The place is very big, so you have to prepare yourself with long walk if you want to see everything. Nad they offer free english guided tour at specified time for around 1.5 hours which I think quite worth it."
Serene and full with historical facts.,Get to the palace early to catch the first change of guards ceremony. There are also tour guides in the different languages that will bring you round the palace. The tour guide we had was hilarious and made the tour even more enjoyable.
Beautiful,Beautiful place...one of the places which you most visit if you are in Seoul!The ancient characteristics of the building are amazing! 
Glorious Day and Glorious Palace,The palace is a very popular with locals and tourists and things were very busy when we were there. The grounds are extensive and well worth a leisurely stroll. The buildings have been lovingly maintained and are in excellent condition - they don't show their age (built in 1300s) at all!
Wonderful experience,"We went on December 30 and the weather was cold but sunny. We went early in the morning as we purchased a hambok rental experience that said we needed to be there between 9:30 and 10:30. If you want to do the rental and see the palace, I do recommend going earlier to beat the crowds. The palace is massive! When I watch K-dramas, these palaces are featured, but I didn't imagine how large the property would be. The buildings themselves are impressive. There are a few showcases of rooms that you can view from the outside. There was also a cafe and restrooms available. It was just fun to walk around in costume and take beautiful and memorable pictures. I read the other reviews that recommended the changing of the guard. The one at 10:00 a.m. was cancelled when we were there, but we were able to view the one at 2:00 p.m. It was quite colorful and beautiful to watch. It lasts for about 20 minutes. If you have time, explore Bukchon Hanok Village on your own afterwards, as it isn't far and it's a beautiful walk around the neighborhood. If you can, time it just before sunset. It's gorgeous."
Huge.,"A huge place, to start with. I was in their hanbok so I got free entry. If you chose to wear traditional korean outfits, you are entitled to a free entry in to not only Gyeongbokgung, but Changedeokgung, Changyeonggung and Jongmyo Shrine. (Those were the places I went.)Didn't had enough time to actually explore the entire Gyeongbokgung but would come back for more - leisure strolls!"
Fabulous experience,"A beautiful Temple, well kept and offering a good half day's experience. Multiple photo opportunities."
Not Conducive to Winter,December is extremely cold in Seoul and regrettably limited our ability to enjoy the experience.We did however enjoy the changing of the guards.
Nice,We spent 2hrs there in the morning.the palace is very nice to take photos.you can get a free english speaking guide.which you have to to understand about everything.at 11am you can watch changing of the guards at the main gate except on tuesdays.it is not suitable for wheelchairs as there are many steps.
Probably the only palace you need to visit in Seoul ,"ThisIs the biggest palace at Seoul, so, really the only one you need to visit. Palaces at South Korea are just not as impressive as in Japan, so, i think a visit to one is sufficient. "
Interesting palace,"Several buidings to see, also big grounds with a lake. There are occasional guided tours, or you can just wander."
Time Well Spent and Great History,The Gyeongbokgung Palace is a must when visiting Seoul. The Palace is easily accessible within the city and very well maintained. You can rent the traditional Korean dress and go for a walk around the premises. The Palace covers a large area and you would be able to visit different premises within the Palace which offers a close encounter with the Palace history and Korean culture. Take your time and walk around while taking some pictures it would be time well spent.
Tourist visit ,"I just had a couple of hours for my self after a long meeting, then I have decided to visit this amazing Palace . "
Korean palace in the heart of Seoul,"Nice grounds to see. Some areas were closed for restoration when I went. Make sure to be there for the changing of the guard ceremony. A lot of it is outdoors, so if you're coming in winter, be prepared. A lot of visitors stopped by the gift shop / cafe to warm up for a bit."
Such an awesome grand historic place.,"Simply, you are not visiting Seoul if you do not visit Gyeongbukgung Palace together with Gwanghwamun Gate. This palace carries so much history that it is a must for all visitors to visit. Make sure you catch the guard changing ceremony."
Korean tradition and beauty,"Korea has maintained a single nation state for 5,000 years. It is a country that has never been invaded by other countries while suffering invasions of foreign powers."
"interesting, but not fascinating","The Palace is in fact a complex of buildings and gardens, with space in between. Closed on Tuesdsay! Can be easily explored in a few hours. The buildings are relatively new, much was destroyed in the many wars of Korea, but have been rebuilt in style. The changing of the guards near the entrace gate is a colourful spectacle, a few times of the day. Check for timing. Some of the buildings are in fact large halls, with colourful paintings and some sculptures, that one can look at from the outside, but not enter. Other buildings can be wandered through; those are spare and not very interesting. The museum for Folk Art is part of the complex, with separate admission. When finished with the palace, one can walk (approx. 20 minutes) to the Bukchon Hanok Village, a collection of relatively well preserved (often renovated) traditional houses along narrow lanes. Very tourist oriented and often crowded, but somewhat pleasant to wander through. Many craft shops for buying souvenirs. "
Main Palace of Joseon dynasty,"This Palace, the largest is one of the main tourist attraction in Seoul. Gyeongbokgung or G Palace is said to have been built during 1395, boosts of more than 7500 rooms and spread over 40 hectares. This Palace served as the main place of residence for Kings of Joseon Dynasty, the nobles and the government servants before most part of it was destroyed by fire during the war with Japan.However, the temple complex has been gradually restored after the war by the later kings of Joseon Dynasty and the Government over the years.Today this palace also houses the Korea’s National Palace Museum and National Folk Museum.This is a massive Palace complex needs at least 4-5 hours to have a decent look inside. Plan your visit so that you do not miss the “Change of Guard Ceremony” which is conducted twice a day.And if you are interested to wear the Korean Traditional Costume, you can get the same on rent here."
Lucked out with free entry ,"Went here with one of my kids and my mom. Not sure how we would feel about it if we had to pay but we lucked out with free entry as it was the last Wednesday of the month as part of Culture Day. We walked around for about 2 hours and had enough. On the way out we saw another museum, the National Folk Museum of Korea, with free entry and had a wander through there. Could have spent hours there but had other plans. "
Nice architecture ,We visited the palace just in time for the changing of guards ceremony which was interesting. The architecture of the gates and the palace was a nice change 
Underwhelming,"This is a sad replica of the Forbidden City in China. The litter around the place is depressing, too. Save your money and go to Beijing instead."
A must visit place for Seoul ,"I would say this place has been the most enjoyable for me throughout my trip in seoul. Very nice and well maintained palace which says a lot about the history of koreans. From 10am to 4pm, there is also a changing guard ceremony which should not be missed. I have also heard that if you wear a hanbok, entrance is free! Do check it out if you visit Seoul! "
Recommended!,"I accidentally joined the free guided tour they provided, and didn’t regret it at all. It’s definitely a must visit place when you’re in Korea. "
Trip down the history lane,This place brings so much traditional feels for the millenials. I also recommend wearing hanbok while visiting this place to give you more superb traditional experience
HANBOK RENTAL,"Not really a review of the place but for those who wants to wear/try hanbok, the Korean traditional dress. Just to let you know that they are available from 5,000KRW. If you ever found one, which costs around 20,000KRW — RUN. Because you will regret it. My friends and I rented one for 20,000KRW. We were dressed with the more ‘normal’ ones as opposed to the commonly rented ones which looked soooo good. The place is good for photoshoot while wearing the hanbok."
True Korean Heritage,"A must visit place if one really want to look and feel the true korean culture and heritage. All the buildings are well preserved. To get the best experience, try to go during the changing of royal guard ceremony (everyday, except on Tuesday, at 10 am and 2 pm), it really worth watching."
This place was doodoo ,"Place was so boring. It was freezing and it had literally nothing there. There were costumes for you to wear, but definitely not worth your time :/"
Go around to see the Beauty ,This palace is beautiful and there is much more to it if you go to the back and around the property. Look for the small lake and take instagramable pictures. 
Very cool part of history ,What a cool place to visit. There is a lot of history here to see. There is a museum next door too that is connected and I believe part of the exhibit that has history displays. There was a changing of the guard at the front entrance of the Palace that was cool too.
interesting place!,went here in winter and i got to see the pond frozen which looked truly magical !! my family and i enjoyed visiting the palace
Family Trip in Seoul On Christmas 2018,Nice to see that this place is wellmaintained so people can really appreciate one of Seoul’s main tourist spots. 
Excellent museum exhibits,The design and artefacts inside the museum are well thought out. You can either read the signages or rent an audio self-guide @ 1000W. Entry to the museum is free but you need to pay to enter the palace grounds.
Interesting and grand,Good place to walk around for an hour or two and see how the palace was organized. All outdoors so dress appropriately for weather.
Beautiful Palace Worth A Visit,This is an amazing palace complex well worth a visit and try and include the changing of the guard. It’s large so lots of walking but flat terrain so comfortable and then a short walk to the presidential blue house.
A good view about the old history,The area is pretty large so it takes at least two hours to go it thru. I recommend to take a guided tour at least for a some time to hear some important things about the place and the Korean history as well.
Changing of the guards,"The palace is rich in history and culture if you’re a history buff. Walking around in the freezing cold was quite difficult because I was with my 72-year-old mom and brother with arthritis. However, it’s a must-visit place in Seoul and we were lucky to witness the ceremony of changing of the guards."
Interesting tour of the palace grounds,The palace has free tours of the grounds with narration in English. It was really interesting to get views of how Korean royalty lived.
BEAUTIFUL,"Seriously one of the most beautiful palaces i've ever been to.It's a MUST!And do not go if you are on a rush, you will need time."
Lots of Replicas,"Since much of Korean culture was destroyed by the Japanese, all the buildings in the palace are replicas of actual buildings. Interesting if you are a history buff but not particularly impressed with the structures themselves."
Great place very traditional,"Hello , Great place to visit suggest you should see guard change and wear traditional clothes .Recommend highly"
The most famous palace in Korea,"This is the most well-known palace in Korea. Representing Joseon Dynasty, visitors who are interested in Korean history and culture would have fun here.- Visitors in Hanbok are free to enter.- There are special programs like evening performances or entrance to Gyeonghoeru Pavilion. So, check them out on the website. You'll have more fun to join them.- There are ceremonies at Gwanghwamun Gate(광화문). 10:00/11:00/13:00/14:00- Hyangwonjeong Pavilion(향원정) is so amazing with lotus pond. It's still under repair unfortunately. Only watching through small windows is allowed.- Gyeonghoeru(경회루) is a large pavilion with nice pond around. The access is only available during special period.- National Palace Museum(국립고궁박물관) and National Folk Museum(국립민속박물관) locate inside Gyeongbokgung. They are also good to visit."
Over hyped. ,"Nothing much except that’s it’s really big. Went during winter, lots of space to walk around but nothing really fascinating "
Lovely to walk around,Enjoyed our visit to the palace an was lovely to walk around (also close to other attractions such as Bukchon Hanock Village and Jogyesa temple. Admission cost was 3000 won. 
Wonderful place to explore,Wonderful place to visit and explore. Good to read up about the place before visiting as that would add to the appreciation of the place.. 
HUGE with lots to discover,"The lake was frozen when I went in February but it was absolutely gorgeous. Learned alot about the history of Korea. The explanations are available in Korean, English, and Mandarin. Also visited the Olympic Winter Games PyeongChang Special Exhibition ""Wintering"" at one of the museums. I remember wishing there were more food options."
Scenic historical locale ,We managed to walk to this location as our hotel is located within walking distances. We had wanted to watch the change of guard but unfortunately it was snowing and the change of guards procession had to be postponed. But we do welcome the snow as it turned the whole palace compound white and it lift the moods of tourists who visited it ! We took some spectacular photos at this location . Highly recommended to visit !
A place not to be missed!,We arrived Gyeongbokgung Palace around 11am and the ticket can be purchased easily when arrived. The ticket queue seems much longer in the afternoon when we're about to leave so start early if you can. Most of the visitors were dressed up in Hanbok costume (traditional Korean dress) where you can rent it. Do note that the guard changing ceremony is at 10am and 2pm. There's a free English Guided tour at 11am but I believe there're other timings in the afternoon as well. 
Change of the guard,4/5 only because the construction at the ticket booth continued during the ceremony. Very clean and historic. 
Tour service was excellent !,"We visited the Palace on a Saturday and was there in time for the Change of Guards ceremony which was held at 10.00am.Don’t be eager to get the tickets without reading carefully the ticket charges. Seniors above 65 can enter free, and child below the age of 7 are free also. Although we are a party of seven, we could have paid for only 3 adults and one child, as the 2 seniors and the child of five years ago were free.After the Change of Guards ceremony, we joined the free tour, which started at 10.30am, for Chinese language. The tour guide was very knowledgeable and very patient with answering questions from the tourists. The explanations were very clear and she did the delivery in an interesting way. History is not necessarily a boring thing if you have someone good at explaining them. Good job to the lady tour guide! "
Simply Amazing,Very highly recommend.Amazing tour. Make sure you attend the guard switching ceremony.Better visitor with a guide to learn about the history.
An Interesting Place to Visit,The Royal Palace is a short distance walk from our hotel. It was very busy on our day of the visit but the palace area is vast so have plenty of areas to move and walk about and don't really feel crowded. There are many individual 'gates' within the complex but they are all spread out including some in the quiet corners too.
Nice palace! ,"Beautiful, historical palace -a photographer's dream setting! A must see in Seoul! Not expensive! Get there early to beat the crowds!"
Nice place must visit ,"Good place for photo memories nothing much to do only to watch the show small show , across the road one shop you can rent the traditional custom per hour and you go inside the place and enjoy taking photos "
"If you like Korean period dramas, you will enjoy walking around","The place is quite big, but guide maps are provided as well as English tours (we just walked around on our own, it was good enough). The performances are VO-ed in English and Mandarin.As we walked along the corridors, scenes from K period dramas I've watched flashed before my eyes haha! Most of the buildings are not the original (no thanks to the Japanese occupation during the war) but rebuilt. They are absolutely beautiful, with gorgeous artwork and minute attention to detail. Later, I watched Monstrum and when they mentioned the name of the hall, I told myself, hey! I've been there!Oh we saw a few Korean young ladies dressed in beautiful hanbok taking pictures? videos? in some of the quieter grounds. Not sure what they were trying to achieve but they were taking turns to run down a stretch and turn around or something. Rather interesting and funny, hee."
Beautiful architecture ,"Great picturesque location, even in winter months as water becomes iced and trees shed leaves. Enjoyed the time out with the family. Downside for visits in winter months is that the place is all outdoors. Limited heating areas (only the cafe close to exit). Otherwise a good place for learning Korean history and taking beautiful pictures with the mountains in the background of the palace. "
Heritage Site,"A palace located in the central of the city of seoul, very easy to get here by MRT there is special exit of this area, inside there the local guide wearing korean traditional will give u the explanation of this site, you can also take a foto using the korean traditional custom inside here. Culture parade will be held here but I forget the start time Recommended place for your holiday in seoul"
More restored grandeur,As part of the tour of the Palace grounds you will encounter this austere yet beautiful building.The setting is perfect for group pictures and a quiet moment.
My Duo Trip to Seoul #cha2korea,"This is my 2nd time visiting the palace. But this time around, i had the chance to suit up myself and my daughter in the traditional Hanbok costume. Walking with the lovely costume to the Palace gives us a brand new experience. Plus, my daughter had fun time with some of the tourists whom was excited to capture her pic in the costume. Nice historical place!"
Beautiful scenery,"Beautiful place, which closes at 17:00So plan accordingly for your visit and enjoy the most of it.Rafael "
Beautiful place stunning buildings,"Well worth the visit, you can feel the history in the place and it's amazing seeing lots of people in the traditional dress .. it's almost like stepping back in time"
Typical Palace,"You will consider the Gyeongbokgung Palace a average asian palace if you've been to Imperial Palace / Forbidden city in China or Angkor Wat in Cambodia. Hence, don't expect too much once you enter the Gyeongbokgung compound. If your main purpose is just to take pictures, you can spend a max of 4 hours roving around the palace. The highlight of our visit in Gyeongbokgung is the changing of guards which is scheduled every 9AM and 2PM."
Must see!,"The palace grounds are massive. You can spend hours walking around Gyeongbokgung Palace. Lots of interesting architecture and statues. Palace was under some construction at the time but didn't take away from the experience. Lots to see so give yourself a couple hours at least. The Museum inside the palace grounds has a lot of exhibits to see as well. If you're a fan of history, this is a must see."
Huge and Majestic,"To be fair, all the buildings that we can see today are accurate replica. The original palace was burnt to ground in 1592. Several buildings were restored in 1890s, while the rest were reconstructed in last 20 years. So, the palace actually contains less historical value compares to Changdeokgung and Deoksugung. However, the Gyeongbokgung is the original ruling palace of Joseon Kings. That attracted us to visit the palace, to see to prosperity and greatness of the Korean Dynasty at its best.The palace is huge, so allocate at least one to two hours to walk around the compound while enjoy the beauty of the gardens, especially in autumn. Wearing comfortable shoes can ensure a good time walking through the ground with sand and uneven stone tiles. There are a few stairs to climb as well. Checking the weather forecast is important so that we can bring an umbrella in case of raining. We found only one cafe available at the souvenir shop. So we need to bring enough water to keep us hydrated if we are planning to stay long in the palace."
Quite Boring,"As important as this palace is in the list of national treasures of South Korea, it's actually quite a boring place to visit full of empty buildings, except for the throne room and the changing of the palace guards. Wish they had filled those buildings with some kind of exhibits to reflect the glory of this palace. I had to get a sense of the magnificence of the palace during its glory days in the National Palace Museum instead."
Historic,I love watching korean drama joseon era... do i love it. Its simple .... nothing special if u don't appreciate history. My friend and i rend an hanbok from the near rental shop which cost us 15000 won per person and we enjoyed taking nice pic with it.
good place to know more on Korea history,a nice place but crowded with tourists. walk through the museum and you will notice that it's actually a good place to see the korea history. the and etc 
Step into your own historical Korean drama!,"Had so much fun touring this palace, imagining the drama and intrigues within its walls! You MUST, I repeat, MUST plan to visit first a hanbok rental place nearby and enjoy wearing this traditional costume while visiting the palace. This made the visit especially memorable and fun.PROS:* Super-fun wearing hanbok (traditional Korean costume) while visiting the palace* Free entrance into the palace, while wearing hanbok.* Lots of opportunity for photos in this historic place, while wearing traditional costume.CONS:* Chilly in November (40F), but manageable * Hanbok rental costs more than palace admission, but hey, it's fun.* Did not rent the audio tour because my husband said it wouldn't match his costume (hahaha!), but would have added much to the tour.Rented hanbok for 3-4 hours because hate to rush back, but we only took 2.5 hours because it was chilly and any longer would not have been necessary."
Immerse yourself in Goryeo setting for an afternoon,"If you’re a fanatic for ancient Goryeo history, probably this will be a good place for you to play princess/prince/queen/king for an afternoon. You’ll be able to rent Hanbok over there and you can take incredible photos with the setting and the costume. Personally I think winter season will be a better time to come as the palace and the snow will make your picture perfect. :)"
Beautiful scenery,Amazing view during late November. The palace was covered in snow when we went so many photo opportunities from outside to inside. Didn't get to finish exploring though cause boyfriend's sports shoes got soaked in puddle from the melted snow...so a heads up to those planning to go to wear proper winter shoes or else you're going to have frozen feet the rest of the walk.
Lovely palace ,Beautiful and scenic also saw the changing of the guard . Please check the website for timing . Must visit to see the scale of the place 
The palace ground is large and very grand,"We made our way here on a Saturday morning, and it was very cold in winter. The palace ground is large and very grand. Definitely a good opportunity to take many photographs and worth a visit if you have time. "
Amazing view. very romantic and very beautiful.,We were there for just an hour. But our eyes drank in the beautiful view. The place has a rich history. Most ideal time to visit the place is autumn. 
Stately and Beautiful,"Stately, commanding buildings. Beautiful lake and pavilion. Mountain views, symmetry. Intricate detail, great line of sight."
A beautiful temple with a rich history.,"We had the pleasure of taking a 2nd trip to Seoul where there is a free transit tour offered by Incheon airport to promote tourism. We stopped in Gyeongbokgung Palace and it was simply amazing. From the ornate designs throughout the various structures to the citizens adorned in traditional dress, it was a great experience from beginning to end. Our tour guide Heejay provided great detail on the history of Korea & of the palace. We will certainly return to spend more time in Seoul & explore all that it has to offer!"
The best but so so,"There are 5 palaces in Seoul, we visited Gyeongbob Palace as recommended the best among the 5. The tour guide told us that most of the palaces are rebuilt because they were burnt down during world war II. I'm not impressed of this best palace. It looks fake. Cannot compare with those I saw in China and Japan. Can give it a miss unless you want to kill time. "
Historical Korea,"Those who loves the history and have exploration anxiety must visit. The guided tour in different languages is available and it is worth. Yes, it is free but have some fixed timing. How it is still under the redevelopment stage and have great plans for it. Thx "
Historical Visit,A must visit place if you are in Seoul. It's in the middle of the city area and you see a lot of tourist wearing Korean traditional Hanbok. There are shops that you rent Hanbok just outside the palace.
Must visit,This is the largest palace of 5 in Seoul. Free entrance for whom wear hanbok. Without hanbok the ticket is 300won.
Nothing much,"Small and nothing much to see. I expect that the palace is more or less like the forbidden city in Beijing, but a bit dissappointed after visiting gyeongbokgung palace. "
Beautiful palace with lots of tourists on traditional clothing,This is one of the major palaces in Seoul with a beautiful pond in the middle of the palace that is one of my favourite photo spots in town whenever I have visitors to the city.
A historical place,This palace is the historical place. We can learn real history and ancient culture of Korea. I would like to recommend to visit this palace at least once who want to understand the Korean history.
Tour visit,A great experience & great scenery. Enjoyed the nice photographic scene. Do rent a traditional Hanbok nearby to experience the Joseon era aura
Great Seoul Palace,"The palace with great history, please accompany with Guide, and have the opportunity to know the history, the people of Korea are extremely good."
Weekend sightseeing,The palace was 10 minutes walk from the Four Seasons and we could see it from the hotel itself. We were fortunate enough to catch the first snow of the season overnight so awoke to a blanket of 2-3 inches of settled snow. The walk to the palace took longer due to the conditions and the visit to the palace made a little more magical by the white out effect. Ordinarily there isn’t too much to see but we dawdled to admire the scene even though it was cold. Felt a little sorry for the guards in costume - hopefully they were suitably dressed underneath. 
"Good sight to see while in Seoul, South Korea ",Just outside the front gate is Gwanghwamun Square and the statue of King Sejong and Admiral Yi Sun-Shin. The palace itself is a nice visit. Try to see the changing of the guards if you can. This palace is one of five found in Seoul. Definitely worth a visit.
Take your time to stroll around the vast palace grounds,"Be there by 10.00 am to watch the changing of the royal guard ceremony; then take a leisurely stroll around the palace grounds and visit the various pavillions and palace buildings. You can cover the palace in about 2.5 hours. Entrance fee is KRW3,000."
Beautiful palace,I loved the palace. Must visit this palace if you’re in Seoul. It’s the most historical place in South Korea. 
Lovely scenery,The grounds of the palace is huge which cannot be covered in half a day. The scenery is beautiful and breathtaking! Shops offering hanbok rentals are many nearby. Visitors to the palace in their hanbok bring back visions fr the royal era.
Majestic,"If you wear a Hanbok, you get to enter the palace for free. It's a very huge palace with majestic architecture. They have free guided tours too. "
A lesson on Korea history,"Acclaimed as the most beautiful palace in Seoul, Gyeongbokgung does measure up to its reputation. With over half a century of existence it encompasses a large area with many buildings and pavilions. I paid USD 10 for entrance and audio guide and spend 3 hours exploring the palace. Despite the large number of tourists, students and locals dressed in typical outfits posing for pictures, one doesn't get the feeling of being crowded. Many buildings were reconstructed to its original design and are very well preserved. I thought the audio guide to be very useful given that there were not many descriptive boards.If you have little time to visit Seoul - as in my 14 h layover - this is the place to visit."
Easily accessible by subway,"I wish I had allowed myself more to explore this palace's halls. However, the short time I was there well whetted my palate to know more about Korean dynastic history.Picturesque, colorful, and ripe with color, texture, and imagery."
K - drama came to life!,"Aside from being a popular place for historical dramas, being in Gyeongbkogung took us back to the old times. I really loved how we were able to experience walking around it and just mesmerized by the structure, culture and history that it holds and represents. The details on the palace, the intricacies in the designs is just awesome. "
A must in Seoul,"No stop in Seoul would be complete without a visit to the former imperial palace, and, for such, you will require to leave at least 2 to three hours for a complete visit.The palace complex consists on several inner buildings as well as a Korean history museum at the very rear of the palace.As with most traditional historical Korean building, most of the ground consist of gravel, so wheelchairs and strollers will require extra effort to move through it. Most of the buildings are located a few steps above ground. When planning your visit, you should check in advance the times for the changing of the guard, which, by itself, is quite a colorful sight."
Very interesting place,Very interesting place. I'm sure it is even more beautiful in the summer months. Only wish there were more signs in English explaining the various buildings. Saw many locals going into the buildings to pray but we weren't sure if tourists were allowed and if they were what the protocol was to enter. We didn't want to be ride or inappropriate and enter so we just admired the beauty from the outside. 
Huge palace,"It's a great palace, like any other I suppose. I tend to imagine what it was like living in a place like that centuries ago while roaming around. Do swing by.I had a good experience."
Nice,Supposed to be the largest. Not that impressive but restoration effort is still on-going. The changing of the guard held at the main gate added to its appeal
Come early or expect crowds,I came here on Sunday noon. There are loads of visitors however you can manage some space in the palace grounds. All the buildings are new since the original were destroyed. It was a really pity. The grounds aren’t huge so you can cover it within 2 hours. 
Nice but Not Spectacular,Nice still through the park.Model of the ancient Palace.The Impression May be better when the Grass is Not Brown and Dry as it was.
Fun adventure wearing their traditional clothes,"The Gyeongbokgung Palace is quite a huge place, with museums inside that describes about the history of ancient Korea. The entry to the palace is free when you wear their tradtional clothes, ""hanbok"". Do remember to check the days the palace is closed before going!"
Their paalcr,If you are into history of ancient and modern Korea. You can pay a visit.You need to pay to get into the main palace. But the museum itself is free. Inside you can learn about the history of Korea.
Visit to the palace,"It was a big palace, although i was not able to visit the inside, to see the interior and the activities. But in general, if you had more time then maybe..."
Must see,This palace seems to go on and on and continues to amaze. The grounds are incredible and the self guided tours (headset and map) are helpful and informative. One really fun thing is that if you dress in traditional Korean clothes entry is free. 
"Gyeongbokgung palace, Seoul, Korea",Excellent historical place to visit. Interesting architecture. There are many hanbok rental shops nearby the palace...a lovely sight seeing tourists all wearing hanboks...view is like straight from the movie set of an ancient korean drama.
Interesting history,Gyeongbokgung palace with it’s various buildings is an interesting place to walk around and explore. It was the main palace of the Joseon dynasty. It not only served as a home of the kings but also the government of Joseon. The palace has been destroyed several times and restored. 
A must-see in Seoul,"I would not miss this palace whenever I came to Seoul. It was just magnificent. Crowded most of the time especially on weekends. If you are lucky, you may be able to visit at night. This year, it closed on Nov. 3. New comers are usually fascinated by the imperial guard ceremonies in the front courtyard. Since I have visited the place many times previously, I rather look for interesting people and things around, for photography."
"Historical Palace, worth to visit","conveniently located nearby the subway, Worth to visit. Buchon village is 15 mins walking distance with a lot of handbook (Korean costume) rental shop and locate clothing/ souvenir shops."
Historical Visit,Visit during autumn/fall season. The scenery very nice with dry cold condition. Need to spend a lot of time due to the big area of the palace.
Highlight of Seoul,"This is without doubt the highlight of Seoul, which you shouldn’t miss out. It is not a spectacular as the forbidden city in Beijing but (at least when we visited) also not as crowded. Many Korran people (and touristsaswell) love to rent historical clothes in one-off the shops around the palace, so you will see many people in traditional dresses. "
Hanbok Heaven,Make sure you visit when the Imperial Guard ceremony is taking place and don't forget to wear your hired Hanbok for the full Kore-xperience.
Palace with train station nearby,The palace ground is so big that 2 hours tour is not enough. The palace are well maintained. Free entrance if your wearing hanbok outfit. Palace guard perform traditional drum parade. 
Great place to visit; closed Tuesdays,Rent the Hanbok and walk around the palace like royalty.Be sure to time your visit for the changing of the guard.
changing of guard,"if you not a history or archi buff, all korean palaces look almost the same to the untrained eye. This is no different. But the changing of the guard ceremony at 10am or 2pm is worth catching. The ceremony is free but hte palace entry is payable.. "
Beautiful palace,"If it’s your first time in Seoul, this is a must see. The palace is huge, you will need to allot 1 to 2 hours or more if you fancy taking pictures while wearing hanbok. The place can get very crowded. Check the schedule of changing of guards and be there to watch it."
Good history introduction,My first introduction to Korean history was a relaxed walk in the palace grounds. I opted for the English language audio guide. Saw the change of guards and enjoyed seeing the many visitors in traditional outfits. I appreciated the effort to preserve Korean culture and present wonderful examples of architecture.
Beautiful palace,"The Palace full of beautiful autumn scenery but also have renovation at major attraction, so cannot fully experience whole beauty of the Palace. The experience of wearing the costume is unforgettable and the changing ceremony also interesting. Not to be miss."
Beautiful fall tour,My boyfriend and I had a great afternoon strolling around the grounds of the Palace. Even though it was a busy day the grounds are so big you barely notice. We had the headset for a self guided tour which made it great for zigzag through and finding some less traveled sections. Beautiful architecture was great for pictures. Really enjoyed our time at the palace. 
Massive Historical Palace,"Gyeongbokgung Palace was the first of many temples I visited around Seoul. This one was definitely the largest and most crowded. I was here during the week so there were a lot of school groups and tours. Admission is really cheap and they do tours as well. I opted to explore by myself, and really tried to experience the history. Unfortunately a lot of the palace was under construction when I went, so I could not see 100% of it. There were so many other buildings and alleys to walk around and see, I was still here for a couple hours. I really enjoyed the scenic mountains in the background, made for some great photo opportunities."
Big and Nice Scenery,One of the 4 palaces in Jongmyo. Good place for photos and it is huge. Happen to also witness protests going on outside the palace.Pretty unique experience and ticket is affordable. Just that a lot of walking to do.
It’s like walking into a historic drama! ,"It’s pretty cool here! Walking around the grounds of the palace, and it’s pretty big too so can spend a good 1-2 hours here. Make sure you come right when they open to avoid the crowds! However the downside is we went to the dessert place inside the palace and wanted to order the “royalty” sweets set, and they told us it won’t be ready until afternoon time. They also offered free guided tours at specific times in different languages throughout the day! "
History buffs - must visit ,"The tour to the palace will give you insights of Korean history, particularly the monarchy. We had a great tour guide, Sharon Yi of VIP travel who gave us detailed historical accounts of Korean Peninsula history and the dynasty that once led the monarchy.The Changing of the Guards was also an interesting experience. Although it was in a smaller scale than what I have seen in other countries, it's always good to witness this spectacular display of a nation's culture. The concept and mechanics are similar as in other countries, but the uniforms are different. Fun colors, interesting style. Palace tour takes a lot of walking. Palace grounds is a work in progress. Since most of it was destroyed during the war, the government is trying to rebuild, replicate and preserve whatever is left of it."
Ideal for art lovers,This is a good place and needs to be in your itinary if you want to see culture or relates to art. It could be crowded so need choose your time very carefully.
Family Trip,"Overall, we enjoyed our visit to Gyeongbokgung palace which served as the household of the Joseon dynasty. The grounds are beautiful and the architecture intriguing. The tickets were reasonably priced and there are free English tours a couple times a day- ours was at 1100. Sadly you don’t get the opportunity to enter any of the traditional buildings and the grounds are rough making them inhospitable to collapsible strollers. Still worth the visit. "
Beautiful,Beautiful and impressive palace.The museum is within the grounds and free to enter. Definitely worth a visit.The palace itself is fantastic. Walking around seeing so many girls in Hannibal makes you feel truly immersed in history. :)
Gorgeous temple fantastic historic place,This place is one the must ones you need to check out while your stay at Seoul it is all about koreans
Gyeongbokgung Palace,I was impressed by the beauty of the Palace and its huge territory. In spite of rainy weather tour to tha Palace was very interesting and informative.
Drizzles,"This palace is beautiful! You get a view of the mountains right behind the palace too. We came in hanboks so we didn't need to pay for entrance. It would have cost us 3000won (18 below is 1500won). You can find their national palace and folk museums inside. They also have a nice cafe where you can find good souvenirs. Lots of places to take photos at. It started drizzling and it added to the drama. They have a changing of the guard ceremony but we didn't get to see that. It happens evert 11am and 3pm. There are English, Japanese, and Chinese guides but you'd need to inquire in advance. Definitely a must go to place!"
Changing of the Guard is a highlight!,"Arrived at the palace at around 9:15am, got our tickets and grabbed a coffee at the Palace Museum before the Changing of the Guard at 10am. Would strongly recommend the Changing of the Guard - was easily the highlight of our visit. After that, we spent about 45 minutes walking around the palace grounds. Without a tour, it's pretty hard to understand the importance of each individual building - if you get the chance to take a tour then definitely do it. After 45 minutes, we were a little bored and ready to move on. It was entertaining watching everyone in their traditional costume take photos around the palace!"
Quảng trường !,"Gyeongbokgung continued to serve as the main palace of the Joseon dynasty until the premises were destroyed by fire during the Imjin War (1592–1598) and abandoned for two centuries. However, in the 19th century, all of the palace's 7,700 rooms were later restored under the leadership of Prince Regent Heungseon during the reign of King Gojong. Some 500 buildings were restored on a site of over 40 hectares.The architectural principles of ancient Korea were incorporated into the tradition and appearance of the Joseon royal court.In the early 20th century, much of the palace was systematically destroyed by Imperial Japan. Since then, the walled palace complex is gradually being restored to its original form. Today, the palace is arguably regarded as being the most beautiful and grandest of all five palaces. It also houses the National Palace Museum of Korea and the National Folk Museum within the premises of the complex"
Really great,Amazing! Went by fall when the colors are so vivid. Not that many other tourists also. Really recommended
Go at 10 AM or 2 PM for the changing of the guard,"If you only have time to visit one of Seoul’s grand palaces, I would recommend this palace. If at all possible, time your visit for either 10 AM or 2 PM for the changing of the guard. You won’t even need to buy an admission ticket to see the guards as they will perform just inside the main gate. About 20 minutes before the above hours the guards will be marching outside the grounds to the changing area. They will be playing drums so you’ll know. Grab a spot outside the blue nylon “crowd control belts” for the best photo opportunities. If you wait too long you’ll be behind 2-4 people. Keep in mind if you’re expecting something similar to Buckingham Palace you may be mildly disappointed. I would estimate there are only about 25-50 marchers/musicians. Still, it’s a wonderful exhibition. "
Lovely ,A friend of ours recommended this place and we were surprised the gardens were beautiful some of the trees were loosing their leaves and the old buildings were pretty and you got to get a sneak peek at one of the buildings getting a upgraded lots of space 
Greatly Blessed by Heaven,"Gyeongbokgung Palace is a must see, the most iconic sight in Seoul. The palace was build in 1395 and it was the largest of the five grand palaces in Seoul. The name Gyeongbok means “greatly blessed by heaven” The architecture , the trees and the mountain reflect spectacular views. Great place for photographers, history lovers, and art lovers. It is stunning in all seasons white in Winter, pink in Spring, orange in Autumn and green in Summer. Tours are available in English language, you can rent the “hanbok costume” and walk through the palace to take photos. The palace also has the National Palace Museum of Korea and the National Folk Museum of Korea"
Where history resides in the middle of Seoul ,"From what I recall, this place used to serve as the king's household back in the day. It was destroyed a few times, but it has been restored to its striking beauty. The main palace and gate can be quite busy with tourists, but if you wander off into the surrounding gardens, you will feel as though you have been transported back in time. It's just you and no one else.You can almost imagine what the palace would have been like back in the day, with the queen's ladies rushing back and forth, scholars being fully concentrated on their books, concubines hidden within the palace walls, and the king ordering his soldiers around. I would highly recommend that if you are planning to go to only one palace during your time in Seoul, that you go to this one."
Large palace grounds and interesting history and architecture,"Neat place. Though destroyed last in the 20th century Japanese occupation, it has been nicely restored. The grounds are extensive so plan a couple of hours, depending on your speed and interest in details. The great thing is that a guided tour is available once you have paid the 3,000 KW admission (like $3US); the tour is available in Chinese, Japanese and English (I assume Korean too!). The English one was available twice / day. 11AM and, I think, 1:30 PM. The guided tour helps appreciate more than the structures so I recommend that you do it as otherwise you are just looking at interesting buildings but miss the ""why"" and ""how"" of royal times in Korea. It is very convenient to the metro. The Blue House (President's House) is right outside the north entrance to the palace grounds so go out the north gate to see it from a distance (you can re-enter palace grounds with your ticket OR, what I recommend, walk east along the outer walls and venture into the historic Bukchon village area just east of the palace). The changing of the guards occurs twice a day: 10 AM and 2 PM."
Nice,"The architecture is mesmerizing. Even can relate to China and Japan's architectures, still it has its own identity"
Beautiful autumn view,"Wounderful autumn view in the palace. Stunning view must visit place in Seoul. We take a lot of beautiful pictures wearing hanbok. However, the palace is super crowded so is advisable to visit in the morning."
Authentic Korean Feels,Went there as part of the group tour package we had on Nov 1-6 2018. I havent read anything about the place so i cherished the experience of just soaking it all in. We went first to the National museum and just a stone throw away is the entrance of this palace. We just basically went directly to the Kings chamber and Queens quarter then that's just it. most of the rooms are close. would have been better if tourist can see what is inside those roomscome a bit early if you don't want other tourist ruining your pictorials. mostly tourists arrived around 10am just like ours in time of the changing of guards ceremony.. 
Great Landmark with Plenty of History,It is one of the important landmark to visit when you're in South Korea. Huge place with plenty of history. Worth a visit.
One of the Main Landmarks ,"This place is a must visit. Really beautiful and serene, great atmosphere, excellent views, touch of history."
Strolling in Palace ground,The palace is very near our hotel. We rented a hanbok costume and stroll in the palace. Wearing their national costume is a welcoming experience its like time travelling on how its like to be a royalty.
Beautiful,Just happened to be there on family culture day. Made it extra special. Anyone who wore traditional dress had there admission price waived. It was fun seeing all the Korean people dressed up. It seemed like they were having a blast. I would go back architecture was incredible.
Must go.. go .. ,"This a beautiful place. Immediately, the beauty of nature well treated by centuries captures you. The trees, changing leaves in this so beautiful autumn in Seoul, the ancient architecture, the wonderful traditions — all makes up your day— a place to visit."
Very interesting ,We totally enjoyed our guided tour of the palace. Such an interesting historical landmark. Our guide was very informative and made sure we were looked after and safe. 
Enormous,"When I first entered the palace, I thought, oh that's all of it. Ok but so-so. Then I went to the back of the palace, and found another palace, the I went deeper, found another, then another, then another. Took me 3 hours to reach the end of the palace and I belive I still did not visit everything. There were the main hall, king's palace, queen palace, prince palace, library, the harem palace, the queen's garden... It's beautiful. They also has many attractions such as traditional music and dances for the tourist."
Great piece of history ,This palace is very atmospheric as you see locals dress in traditional clothing whilst sightseeing. Lots of interesting structures to see. Can get crowded but can still take good photos.
A nice stroll,You can’t get in to too many buildings but just walking around is stunning. The bright colours and the architecture - worth it.
Gyeongbokgung Palace,We arrived in time for the changing of guards ceremony. After watching the ceremony and taking photos we proceeded to rent some Hanbok to wear. We easily found one near the gate. Rent the hanbok for 4 hours so we have an ample time to explore. The place is big enough that you have enough private space even though there were a lot of people during our visit. Lots of areas for photo ops with all the traditional Korean architecture all around. We came during autumn so the colors of the leaves enhances more the beauty of the palace. There were also lots of tourist that came in hanbok. Definitely had a great time with this experience.
Gyeongbokgung Palace,"The Palace complex was interesting, easy to take 1-2 hours and see everything. The architecture was very interesting and tours were available. Great venue for pictures. It was about 45 minutes from Downtown so Metro, Uber, or Cab. "
Worth th visit,One of the five seoul palaces but the most important one. we attend first the guard change ceremony (very interesting) and then we went with the english guided visit offerd by seoul city by a very nice weather.The palace has a typical korean architecture and the garden are also so nice.A must during a stay in seoul
Let's free from stress here,"I went to Gyeongbokgung Palace last year with my friends. The transportation to get there is not complicated. I took the subway( Line 3 orange one) and got off at Gyeongbokgung Palace station. I was really excited to try Hanbok on which is Korean traditional clothes. There are many shops where visitors can lend Hanbok. My friends and I also wore Hanbok. We walked around inside of Gyeongbokgung Palace, and the time was really good because it was super peaceful.If you like peaceful place, I recommend you enjoy Gyeongbokgung Palace with Hanbok."
the history part of the city,"Worth visiting to learn about Korean history. Don't go in rainly weather as part of the ground is sandy. Check the time for free guided tour, and definitely the guard change ceremony twice a day (10:00 am and 2:00pm). If you want to dress in traditional Korean costumes, you rent in nearby shops and don't need to purchase the ticket."
Palace visit,A good visit to understand the erstwhile Korean royal traditions. Wearing the Hanbok is an option to consider
Summer trip,"From the nearest metro to the palace is quite far. Just head straight to the statue and the palace gate is behind it. There is exhanging of the guards during specific times, so be sure to check it out before heading there to not miss it out. "
A taste of Korean History,"A taste of Korean history. Don’t forget to check the timing changing of guards inside the Palace with their traditional military attire. Feel free to roam around the Palace like Joseun’s princesses, princes or even like a King! You can rent traditional outfits inside. A must for K-drama fans. Explore korean cuisins outside the Palace as well. Best time to travel in fall, winter or spring time! Korean history is cool and very interesting!"
A Palace to remember!,Been here for almost 4x in my Korea trip. But it always amaze me everytime I go here. It really gives us the ambience of a palace in the city. :)
Going back in time,"It's like visiting a K-drama historical era. If you have a tour package, it might not included the hanbok rental and your tour guide might only go to areas that are more popular for picture taking. If you have time, explore the whole place visit the small alleys that are less crowded and quiet."
History and Cultural in The City,One of the best side that we found on our trip to Seoul. Must try the King's Tea set meal that they offer at Royal Kitchen.the best time to visit are in summer since you can enjoy the beautiful landscape and pond the have in the castle. Would love to pay visit one more time in nearest time.
A must see palace in Seoul,"The culture of Joseon dynasty is almost similar with China Beijing palace too. The palace ground is not so huge but it is good for photography.Before visiting other palace, this is the main building for administrative during the Joseon era. Many of the buildings has been rebuilt and maintain as it was during that time. Now it is a musuem for everyone to enjoy."
historical site with great view,"while visiting gyeongbokgung, try wearing hanbok. You can find hanbok rental around the palace. if you using subway, go to gyeongbokgung station exit 5, you'll go straight to the palace. if you want to rental hanbok go to exit 3. You won't net to pay the entrance fee if you're using hanbok (which cost 3.000 won/person). it's noce experience wearing hanbok and strolling around this nice palace. a lot of instagrammable spot."
Geongbuksung palace,"It is a huge palace with huge compunds. I assume the palace must be a very busy place with lots of activities going on, during those days. Another attraction is of cours the president’s official residence, which can be viewed from one of the gates in the palace."
A fun afternoon exploring,Do yourself and other tourists a favor and rent a hanbok from one of the nearby rental places across the road before going in. You save the price of admission (which admittedly isn't high) and have a whole lot more fun. 
Welcome to Korea,It was a good glimpse of their tradition and culture. The place is very clean and just the right spot for a tourist spot. 
Sightseeing,It was last Wednesday of the month when we visited hence it was entrance is free. Did not realise this till we were there. Nice scenery and it felt as though we were not in the city~
Best visit in the autumn,"This is a beautiful palace that is located near the Jae Sung de hwang statue. I enjoyed the autumn leaves color at this Palace, so beautiful!"
Beautifully preserved historic place,"I went there with my family wearing the Hanbok, so we got the free admission. The place is wonderful, and not too crowded. Lots of chance to take good photograph."
grand palace,It was a great place to see how Korea's royalty used to live. The tour guide told us that there was no longer a royal family but the structures were still preserved and respected by Koreans. 
Well preserved historic site,If you want to step into history that is well preserved and has people dressed from that era walking around. This is the place to visit because there are actual guards standing outside and guard changes during certain times. The building and everything has been well-preserved and it is just a beautiful site to take in. There are tour groups that you can join for explanations. 
It is amazing.,"The Palace surprised me: it is huge and very interesting, I had a guided tour with my workgroup and all of us were fascinated."
Large Palace,"I would suggest to go early. So that you can get your insta-worthy shots without too much background distractions. We reached the palace around 10am-11am and it is already packed. It might be due to that I visited the palace on Sunday. Such a shame that I didn't get to watch the guard changing ceremony.Good thing that our tour guide is well versed with the history of the palace, so we don't have to use the tour provided by the palace. "
A Korean palace ,Lovingly place to visit during autumn when the weather is nice and cooling. A lot of space with mountains as a backdrop.A lot of Korean history has Chinese influence. Draw your own comparison if you been to china and korea :)
Beautiful,"I would recommend going early. By 11am the place was very crowded. There are 3 free English speaking tours and we attended the 1.30 tour. It was very informative. The buildings are interesting and we learnt a lot of its history. However the highlight was the peaceful garden, by the water and with the mountains in the background. We sat here for at least an hour after the tour, away from the bustle of seoul outside the walls."
majestic indeed,this is a majestic palace. we got a glimpse of korean culture of the past. it was cold when we went there so it was a chilly tour but we enjoyed it
Definitely worth a visit,"Really pretty in autumn, with lots of golden leaves everywhere. Stunning buildings and tranquil pools. "
It is okey ,well I still prefer JAPAN and Beijing .... Korean palace is not that really interesting like in Japan or beijing .... 
beautiful slice of history in the midst of modern day seoul,"other reviews have summarized the palace nicely so i'll just add a few extra points:- changing of the guard happens twice daily. i saw the morning change and the route goes from the side door by the ticket booth to the front main entrance at gwanghwamun gate, with most of the action taking place in the middle aisle approaching the gate. situate yourself accordingly.- attempted to use the discover seoul pass for palace entry and we were denied by two different ticketing agents. it's only 3000 krw though so paying the entrance fee wasn't an issue. just a heads up for others using the pass!- didn't join a tour group because of time constraints but if you have the time to wander the grounds slowly, i'd suggest joining a free tour group! you'll get even more insight than just from the pamphlets. - while there are some ramps available, the grounds as a whole aren't very wheelchair friendly. i saw a few elderly tour groups struggling to push people in wheelchairs over the stone pathways. i can see the terrain and general layout of many thresholds and stairs as being a hazard for people using canes, walkers, and other mobility aids."
Lovely stroll through history,"I thought the most amazing thing about the palace was the surroundings. You looking at these hundreds of years old buildings, no running water, hot water electricity, turn your head and see skyscrapers.The juxtaposition of the new and old is one of the best things about South Korea, the past isnt just there, its embraced and celebrated and the palace is one of the best examples of that.Plan half the day, the buildings really do look similar and its easy to get turned around, i recommend using the information map and having a pen to mark off the buildings listed to make sure you really saw everything. The best part was that it wasn't a look and dont touch experience, there is a library on the grounds that you can enter, they give you slippers, and look at the books."
Picturesque,"In my opinion, you can skip the Changdeokgung Palace but not this one. Try on a Hanbok and be one with the crowd in awe of the wonderful scenery --not to mention, the instagram-worthy spots too!"
Back to the past,"Highly recommended to rent a hanbok to tour this grand Palace. Many photogenic spots available for you to shoot. Don't worry, there'll be many others who is wearing hanbok too over there. Free entrance for those who are wearing hanbok. "
Very interesting historical visit ,"Very close from Subway station in line 3 (gyeongbokgung station), this is a must see if you are a few days in town. Not expensive ( 3000 krw), no big wait line. I was lucky to arrive at 10 am on a Saturday when a show with dressed up Korean warriors played a ceremonial entrance at the sound of trumpets and gong. In addition, not as crowded as historical sites in Beijing. Thumb up therefore."
'A palace not to be missed',"This is my second time coming to the palace. I spent more time in the palace this time round and even wore a hanbok. Most parts of the palace looks the same but if you are short of time, just see the main entrance area and the big front part of the palace and finish of by visiting the garden. y.I didnt spend alot of time this palace when I came the first trip because I had other sites to explore. Good for picturesque shots and instagram worth. Try to come early if you want less people."
 An iconic place to visit,The Palace is at The Center OF The City. IT has three gates and at 10am there is The changing OF The guards. The events takes about 15 to 20 minutes. The Palace grounds is huge and The Center is The throne Building. You can see Thru The Front door to see The throne but you can not get inside. Then you can see The living quarters OF The royale at The back. Be ready for The crowd but a worthwhile activity.
Great view and Large Area to see!,This palace is pretty and very big to explore. You can take a half day for taking so much beautiful picture especially on the part where you enter the palace and go to the left where there is a park there is a palace in a middle of little lake. Very recommended to go there.
Interesting place to see,"Wonderful to see and learn about the history of Korea, we visited in a Wednesday and it wasn’t overly crowded. Very beautiful. We had a small group and a guide who was enthusiastic about his tour which was great to have clear information and easy to walk around. Seoul N Tour company was excellent, confirming and communication with tours."
Easy access to large palace grounds and buildings,"This is one of the main attractions of any visit to Seoul. We walked right around the exterior walls in the early morning before it opened for a bit of exercise. The buildings on the inside are large but nor elaborate - grand but understated. The thing that interested me most was how they heated these large buildings in winter by having fires burning in alcoves in strategic places in the stone foundations to provide underfloor heating. Without that, they would have been freezing in winter."
The Gyeongbokgung Palace,Its a good place to visit if you are one interested in the cultural experience exploring new places. Try renting a Hanbok while walking around the place. It was a bit crowded when we were there (peak season) and dont miss the Changing of the guards ceremony (check the times when you visit)
cultural experience,it's really fun to experiece with hanbok at this palace. i just a little crowded during the month i visited. maybe it's autumn now! overall great and enjoyed at here. love it.
Hanboks are the attraction for me,I feel like i enjoyed the people wearing their traditional costumes more. The palace itself is not so much an attraction for me. 
Worth the visit,"When I visited the palace was closed to the public, it is closed on Tuesday, but nevertheless I was not disappointed, it easy to get to the palace by subway, you to get to Seoul station, read the map, buy the ticket and get to the palace station, from there it is about a 3-5 minutes walk to the palace, there is a museum with a couple shops and café nearby, it was raining when I visited so my exploration was limited, however I would recommend the palace visit, entry to the museum was free of charge and the subway is inexpensive, on average it costs about 5000 south Korean won per trip one way and the journey may take about 1 hour from Seoul station."
Lovely in the fall,Had a lot to take in and a short time to do it. didn't get to see it all. but the architecture and vibrant colors of the buildings and the fall foliage was wonderful. for 3000 KRW it was well worth the visit.
Beautiful,"Quite busy with Hanok wearing tourists but the palace is great to walk around and take it in , especially when it's a sunny day"
Awesome view,"Historical places, nice to take picture as a tourist ( landmark) Also you get to try hanbok( korea traditional cloth) "
Great museum and the Palace,The museum is a good introduction to Korean history and society.Unfortunately was a rainy day and walking outside was limited. 
Scenic,nice and scenic. good for pictures taking. must rent the costume from the east side of the palace. free entrance if you are in costume. otherwise need to purchase ticket.
Night at the palace ,Went specifically for the night lights. There was a special music performance at night but didn’t manage to stay for it. Go if you want to take amazing photos 
Beautiful Palace,This is a beautiful place to wander around and imagine what it was like in the past. The changing of the guards was an interesting ceremony.
Nice to see,"Cheap enough to enter and as others have said, once you've seen one you've kinda seen them all. Would recommend."
Worth visiting the Palace ,It's worth seeing this palace and get to know some historical facts.Huge Palace and you need to buy ticket to enter the main Palace. 
Nice palace but too pack with tourists,"One of the major palaces in Seoul city center. All tourists tours will definitely make a stop here. The place is nice but its just too pack with people. Opt for the other palace, although smaller but you get to enjoy it"
Beautiful Palace and grounds,"I was fortunate on my visit here to see a lot of students dressed in traditional Korean costumes which made the atmosphere more enchanting, even though it was drizzling during my visit. Close the the Folk Museum also which was great!"
Bringing Drama Scene To Life,"Visited this palace during the fall season, and you will see the surroundings with yellowish or redish trees. I only visited 2 palaces in total, but seems this is one of the biggest? Not too sure. It seems that the palace internal design and its layout looks pretty much similar. If you are one who watched quite a few of those Korea’s ancient drama, you will feel that those drama scene came alive in front of you. There’s a national museum (just right when you came out of the station) which is free admission. Personally, I find it really interesting as you get to know the rich history of Korea in the past. Further ahead (right besides the museum), there’s a park (at least that’s what I think it is) where you will see a big massive big yellowish tree. Many people who rented the traditional hanbok costume will be taking pictures at there. It was really some nice scene and relaxing. "
Historical ,"This is the only palace we visited during this trip, we did make an online reservation 3 days ago in order for us to join their palace tour. Same entrance fee for visitor with or without the guide, we have chosen the morning session and very lucky that the weather is so good and we managed to get some nice photos. My own opinion, if you would like to take more photos then try not to follow the guide, we drop the group half way so that our time is more flexible and no need to rush, remember the palace is very big, it is not easy to finish the tour and then walk all the way back to the place that you want to take photos."
Beautiful Palace,"It was my second time visiting this palace and it was still a wonder to the eyes. It is very large and touring around it will take more than an hour. This is one of the more famous filming sites in Korea. If you are lucky, there are also ceremonies which you will get to see live for free. Entrance fee is 3000 won and it is worth it (at least for me); clean and very well maintained. If you’re into architectures and culture, this place is highly recommended."
Must see place,"The palace is really characteristic and I recommend its visit. Remember, that you need to purchase a ticket to enter the area."
Amazing architecture and history of korean royals,"One of the most iconic sites in seoul. You need to buy a ticket to visit the rest of the palace’s compound. There are more residences, hall and pavilion inside the compound. You can also see the changing of the guard ceremony at the gates. Its free."
One of my top 10,The palace has a ceremony for the changing of the guards. And the architecture is breathless. Definitely need to check it out when In Seoul.
Great place to take photos and enjoy the history,Nice Palace for taking photos with family and friends. Alot of greens and lakes lakes around the area. Recommend to come early as it gets packed quickly with tours. 
Best Palace in Seoul,No comment. This the best Palace in Seoul compare to other palace. The view is prefect even without autumn leave. Must visit.
Appreciate History,Venture in this place if you want to see historical architectures. Many locals and tourists visit here too.
Average destination but in a good location,You can see a bunch of palaces and interesting places. The major gripe I had was the amount of information in English was limited. I would love to see more in depth historical descriptions and other things to make looking at the architecture worth it. Worth the trip if you are in the area but not terribly exciting
Nice Palace Beautiful Costumes,We enjoyed our visit to the Palace and especially the surrounding park and open area. The weather was sunny and pleasant so there were many people wearing traditional Korean costumes which created a special atmosphere and beauty. Costumes can be rented a shops around the park. Definitely worth a visit and even donning a traditional costume!
Historical Visit to Ancient Seoul,Great 1/2 day trip staring with watching changing of the Guards. Wonderful grounds and beautiful buildings. Top it off with a visit to the Korean Folk Lore Museum. 
Fairy tale place but full of tourists!,"If you travel to Seoul, a visit to this palace is a must! While we did not hire any handbock (found it a bit of a tourist trap), we did enjoy the walk around the palace and very much loved watching people dressed up with the traditional Korean clothes, and took many pics of people taking pics. I can recommend a visit but be aware that you will find many many people there."
Worth visiting but busy ,This palace is definitely worth visiting. Be prepared to walk as it is big. Changing ceremony is good but do note that it is supremely busy so try and find a quiet time or go early. 
Heritage Architecture,"There are a lot of palaces in the Seoul, but this is the best of the lot. Very nice and well maintained....but NO visitors ..."
Main royal palace of the Joseon dynasty,"Consider purchasing the royal palace pass that includes 4 palaces and the royal shrine for 10,000 (approx $8.80USD).Destroyed by a fire in 1592, it remained in ruins for over 270 years. In 1867 it was restored...during the Japanese occupation a lot of damage occurred. In 1915 over 90% of the buildings were destroyed. In 1990 a new renovation project began.If you purchased the 4 palace package of tickets it is worth to see."
Very interesting ,Was business trip with a little pleasure mixed in. Found the palace of great interest. Place is clean and in the center of the old part of town. Easy parking. Traffic to get there is bad. But traffic in The city is bad everywhere. 
Worth it to visit at least once,Went there in the morning and with the perfect weather it was a great stroll. Saw a lot of people wearing the traditional korean outfit. It has good history and make sure you grab a map as you go it for guidance.
"If you have only a few hours of free time, visit here","This is the most popular palace in Seoul, for both locals and foreigners.If you only have a few hours in Seoul between business meetings, I recommend starting from here, take a stroll down towards the City Hall.Gyeongbok Palace's pond is one of must-see views of Seoul."
Thoroughly enjoyed strolling around the extensive grounds,"I came here on Sunday not really sure what to expect having read that it is a very popular place. Certainly the queues at the ticket counters weren't as long as the day before, but nevertheless I was rather apprehensive about getting caught up in the crowds. As it was I didn't need to worry. There were a lot of people around but the grounds are really impressively big and I never felt being in an overcrowded situation. Indeed, the deeper you walk north towards the Bukaksan mountain, the thinner the crowds become. I found myself walking though some Palace buildings completely on my own. I wasn't worried by the paucity of information in the English language. I navigated around with a small pamphlet available near the entrance and dipped into the internet whenever I needed special information like details about the alleged gruesome assassination of Queen Myeongseong by Japanese assassins.Indeed it's worth noticing that this ""Brilliance and Fortune"" Palace (Gyeon Bok) of the Joseon dynasty was destroyed by fire and Japanese invaders going back many centuries (and even as recently as the 1940s during the last WW2). And most, if not all of the buildings were restored since the 1990!sI visited on a lovely warm, sunny October day which was ideal. I was really impressed to see so many people dressed in traditional ""Hanbok"" costumes from the Joseon period. There were even the odd (really odd) groups of lads dressed up in the costumes usually reserved for ladies... Apparently anyone so dressed gets preferential and free access to the palaces, so now you know."
Fascinating but crowded ,"A short trip, this place needs a guide.Many tour groups create challenges for accessThe historical significance is important but lost as few English signs or information boards.An English map is available free near front gate office "
Amazing look into History of Korea,Beautifully maintained buildings and gardens. A real onsite in to the history of Korea. So many people dress in traditional clothing to visit the palace. You can enjoy a tea ceremony of learn to make rice cakes. Allow several hours for your visit but dont miss it
Interesting Palace,"My mother wanted to go to Asia and this is what she expected to see. It is a turn ""East Asian"" experience. A must see in Seoul. "
Must do when in Seoul! Wear a traditional costume when you're there!,"As an avid fan of main attractions when travelling, I find Gyeongbokgung a great experience because it is value for money and it is immersive. You get to walk around the palace almost unrestricted and the place is well maintained. Great for photos and a half day session. Be sure to catch the changing of guard ceremony that happens at midday.Check out one of the traditional costume rentals around the vicinity of the palace and rent them around 15000-20000 won for two hours.It's great because you don't have to pay for palace entry when you're in costume!"
Loads of walking and picture taking,I had fun visiting this place and reading about its history. Some people dressed up in the national attire which made me feel like I travelled back in time.
A good place to visit ones,"Make sure you catch the English(or your language) free tour they offer twice a day. Without that and coming from more grandiose places( in India), this might not look like a big deal unless you learn the history."
Grand palace,Impressively large courtyards leading to the main palace. Arrive early in the morning to have no crowds and the whole place to yourself for great photos. Not much shade so bring an umbrella when it's very sunny outside.
Great Place to Visit!,"We enjoyed visiting Gyeongbokgung Palace very much. We were, unfortunately, there during a rainy patch. It would have been a lot more fun on a sunny day. Many visitors show up in traditional Korean dress and take photographs, which adds to the ambiance. "
Summer in Gueongbokgung Palace,"We went there in summer, it was so hot and crowded at the same time. We enjoyed visiting historical palace in Seoul eventhough only for a while because there were many good spots to take photo and the sunlight really supported us :)"
Step back in time,We spent a few hours living/wandering through the Josein Dynasty as we explored this palace. Easy access to the area by bus or Subway. We arrived in time to watch the guard change at the front gate and then wandered inside. Loved especially watching the gals in their period dresses taking each other’s pictures. It was a great day.
Great Palace,"Great Palace,, the architecture, the building and also perfect weather in October. One of the place you have to visit in Seoul. "
Nice Location,Great location lots of people in traditional costume. Unfortunately it was raining and it is an open air kind of deal but still worth it
Awesome!,Arrived just in time to watch the changing of the guard. Neat to see and get to take pictures with them. The palace grounds is quite large and lots to see. Do recommend!
"Beautiful palace and gardens, a must see","We got to the Palace about 9.45 am, just in time to watch the changing of the guard ceremony which was colourful and interesting. It took about 20 minutes and then we explored the palace and the gardens. It was extremely busy, many visitors opting to rent hanboks, the traditional Korean dress from shops nearby, and then posing at every opportunity for selfies or group photos. We opted not to do the free guided tour as the leaflets we got with the tickets gave us enough information and there are signboards beside each building, all in English as well as other languages. Given the number of visitors it would be hard to hear your guide unless you had individual audio devices and headphones (which I noticed some private groups had).The palace buildings are well preserved and interesting in themselves, but the gardens are equally lovely and as the grounds are quite extensive we spent much of our time just wandering around enjoying the scenery away from the crowds. "
Excellent !,"After a nice lunch at nearby famous eatery, we walk to Gyeongbokgung, the weather is cool but the sun is torching above us. The surrounding atmospehere is great because you can see a huge percentage of people wearing hanbok, Korean traditional costume and alot of people are shooting photo like pro inside the place.And so coincidence the day we visited is the beginning of chuseok, where the entrance is free to every one, the palace it self is quite a huge area, the setup and building is heavily Chinese influence.My kids are having lot of fun inside, because they can run around the palace spacey area, they have a small cafeteria inside where you can have sip of coffee and some light korean delights. In it there is a small section of souvenir corner too where you can get some Gyeongbokgung Palace related items"
"A beautiful royal palace near Anguk station, Seoul","Easy to visit, not expensive (I paid my entrance 3000 Wons), it is beautifully restored and shows that grandeur of the Joseon . You can visit the palace, the pavilions, lots of beautiful gardens. This palace used to be the home of Kings of the Joseon dynasty, the Kings' households, as well as the government of Joseon. Not to be missed!"
Beautiful palace,"Chinese style palace, but still very beautiful.You can enjoy the palace with Korean traditional clothes which could be rented out side the palace.Very beautiful inside.Must see spot!中國式的宮殿，但仍然非常壯麗。你可以在景福宮外頭租韓國傳統的服飾一遊景福宮。宮殿內頭非常漂亮。非常推薦的景點。"
Scenic and Incredible,Korea has preserved this place of over 600+ years and it still looks spot on. The place is scenic and incredible. It is very rich in history and there's a free English tour.
Gyeongbokgung Palace during Chuseok 2018,"At first I wasn’t aware that my time of visit to seoul coincide with one of the biggest Annual Korean Holiday which is Chuseok or Korean thanksgiving. Me and my family decided to visit Gyeongbokgung during the first day of chuseok (we had prior research on which place will open during that time and Gyeongbokgung Palace happen to open during that day). Keep in mind, turns out the entrance fee during chuseok is free for public during chuseok days ! The palace was really crowded with people and best time to visit is during lunchtime. Although it will get real hot since the sun is just right above us ! But all in all we had a great time there, even my sister and mom decided to rent a hanbok (Korean traditional dresses) to get into the spirit of festivity."
Magnificent monument,This is a hitoric and intesting 600 year old palace. Great view of the old and new parts of Sepul from the terrace. The Banquet hall is elegant and peaceful. Free admission.
It’s still fun to visit ,"Was there for the free English tour. It was nice, i can understand that it won’t be too informative as it’s free tour after all. But the tour guide gave us some understanding of Korean king culture. A lot of people wearing hanbok to get in for free. Missed the change of guards because of the free tour. we would thought that they will arrange the tour timing so that tour started off with the change of guards. To have that nice flow"
Beautiful architecture & historical monument,A highlight of a trip to Seoul. So beautiful to see locals wearing the traditional hanbuk outfits. The downside? The multitude of selfies taken by tourists!!! Doesn't anyone enjoy sightseeing anymore?!
"Very busy, but worth a visit!",This beautifully restored and maintained property is lovely to see. It's very scenic with many folks wandering the grounds in traditional costumes. I would have loved to spend more time here!
love it,You should visit all the palace. all are special in there own way. Gyeongbokgung is ofcourse the bigest and the one you shoud do for sure when you are in Korea
Gyeongbokgung - main palace in seoul,"Gyeongbokgung - main palace in seoul. A must do on your Seoul tour list. A hugh palace area with wide green areas, a lot of temples and wonderful atmosphere. 3 bucks (2018) for Entrance is absolutely worth. ITip: f u want to top it costum in traditional hanbok clothes and feel like princess and prince charming with your beloved as many other couples do. Hanbok rental in nearby streets. (10.000W per 2hour). If u prefer more calm time for your visit avoid weekends. See u there"
Beautiful,This is one of the biggest palace i every been in Seoul. You can hire Hanbok nearby and take pictures about the whole palace. There are alot of different performance nearby such as Folk museum and others within the palace. There are alot to see inside the palace and alot of photo area to pose with your hanbok! 
My 3rd visit and still enjoyable,"Seoul is one of my favorite cities and this palace is a great place to start a Seoul visit. The Palace ticket is 10,000 Won and a great deal. It allows you to visit all 4 palaces which charge entry plus the Joseon tombs and the secret garden tour. This palace is the center of Seoul and considered the most important palace in the Joseon reign. The guided tour is worth taking and then you can go to the nearby folk museum or palace museum. Plan about 2 hours for the palace and 4-6 hours if you combine it with the excellent neighboring museums."
Cultural visit to immerse oneself in the Korean palace grounds,"The location of the palace is accessible by subway and there are lots of helpful signage to reach the area. Take note that the palace is HUGE - so pls wear proper walking shoes and be prepared for some exercise! If you rented a hanbok (traditional Korean clothing) then you would be waived for the entrance fee, but for those who wear the usual clothes, you need to join a long line to queue for entrance fee of KW6000. We arrived just in time for the activity for training palace soldiers on attack and defense, it was quite a show by the soldiers complete with drumbeats and war-cries. After that was the activity for changing of the palace guards, which had a marching band and another set of cultural steps to show the audience. The costumes were lovely and really brought us back to feeling the age of that era!The buildings are really something to admire the intricacy of designs and the entire palace grounds layout is amazing. The flooring is mostly made from uneven stones, so pls ensure you have proper shoes to walk steadily. It makes me wonder how do people from those days run on such ground!"
Gyeongbokgung,I dont like this place. It's better to go to Kyoto (Japan ) or Hue ( Vietnam ). I think I wont come back.
Beautiful,Rent a hanbok and wear the traditional Korean outfit for free entry and snap beautiful selfies in the picturesque grounds that also has a cultural centre next door.
Beautiful palace in the middle of Seoul ,This is a must see. The architecture is beautiful and it’s an oasis in the city. Take some time and walk the grounds as well. 
Beautiful place not to be missed when in Seoul,"We visited this place with two children.It is beautiful place and lots to see Highly recommend.Give enough time .Lots of walking .We took English speaking guide,Bit disappointed as she spoke very fast and did not allow group together to catch up.Go early as not to miss changing of guard and visit to Gardens. ."
Impressive grounds,Quite a number of structures displaying typical housing of past royalty. Well maintained and easy to get around. Large place and makes you think about what life was like in the past. Ceremonial changing of the guards was pretty neat to see as well. .
Changing of the guards,"Arrived just in time for the changing of the guards! We took a cab to the palace, so I’m not too sure about parking. "
Place to see the traditional Palace of Korea,"With the entrance fee of 3000KRW for an adult, it is worthed to see the beauty of Palace and park with the background of the mountain. Besides that, you can see people wearing the traditional Hanbok walking around the palace. There is a museum where you can visit and have a look the antique things and the history of the Palace. "
Good place but not friendly wheelchair,I bring my daughter use wheelchair. She is very exciting to see king's palace..but unfortunately she's can't explore because the location is not very friendly for wheelchair. Hopefully someday uf we can back to Seoul again the goverment make some revolution for wheelchair can more convenient.
Iconic Korean historic sight,Good start to touring Seoul & Korea. Limited English signage. Great place to see people wear hanboks. (Free admission to palaces if wearing.)
Nice place to walk around ,"We spent a couple of hours walking around a looking at all the buildings and then went to a museum at the end, which is included in the admission fee. You are able to rent traditional costumes for photo taking. We didn’t do this, but we did see a lot of people wearing the transitional clothes. "
You can rent a Korea costume to walk through the grounds in and then your entrance is free,That’s what someone we met there said. It’s like Buckingham palace Korean style in that they have their fancy guards too at the gate. The grounds are beautiful and can’t believe how many buildings they have rebuilt. Very traditional architecture. Very central to walk to other interesting places. The president’s home and various embassies are directly behind the temple. You can’t go in the gated compound of the president and embassies but it is interesting never-the-less. The Museum of Korean Folk History is right beside the compound. Also worth seeing.
Beautiful!,"I visited the Palace grounds twice as the first time I did not get a chance to see it all. The second time with a friend, we rented traditional Korean outfits and explored. Was such a neat experience and excellent for photographs. The palace and the grounds are beautifully kept and so much history. "
Great Historic Site,I was impressed by how much history this site holds. Even though most of the buildings are not original it's still a great stop in Seoul. Be sure to be present for the changing of the guards that was my favorite part of this visit!
A must see in Korea,"Take a tour of the palace, they will make sure you're in the right spot to get great pictures and see all the entertainment."
One of Seoul Icon,"Visited this palace with family.We rent hanbok, so we can take a nice picture around the palace.If you are wearing hanbok the traditional outfit of Seoul, you can enter the palace for free.You can also see the ceremony of palace guard changing at 10 AM.You can rent the hanbok outside the palace and walk accross the street to enter the palace."
Gyeongbokgung - 3 hours ,Quite ok if you’re not rushing for time to shop and prefer sightseeing. It gets more interesting after you are half-way done where you get to see smaller designated rooms/areas meant for various functions.
Beautiful and picturesque,"This is a fantastic palace to visit in Seoul as it's very large and there's so much to see. There are many picturesque views to photograph and if you bought the combination ticket for the palace and royal shrine, you'll be able to read a little of its history in the booklet."
Must visit in Seoul,Gyeongbokgung is a must visit attractions in Seoul. Easy access from every corner of Seoul. This vast palace complex is well preserved and well maintained. It took more than 3hours to tour this complex. You can learn the magnificent Koryo Kingdom from this palace.
Beautiful old time piece preserved ,A nice stroll in any time of the day is great in this palace. So much to venture and see. You'll meet friendly locals here just watch out for the tourist ;) 
The best 'historic' site to see in Seoul,"Hands down this is the best historic site to see in Seoul. Although it is not the original structures from hundreds of years ago, as the Japanese have repeatedly burned the down over the years, it is still very nice and provides a view into the Korea of yesteryear. If you are in Seoul and enjoy architecture or history this should be at the top of your list."
Spend a Couple Hours Minimum,"At first I thought this would only take a half hour to get the gist of, but we ended up watching the changing of the guard, strolling around the pond, and also seeing the throne room, which was all nice. Then we moved through the historic village on the premises and really liked that. We didn’t go inside the cultural center or the gallery on the grounds. We ended up spending two hours, and could have stayed longer. Well worth the entry fee of around $3."
Was a bit boring,"We took the train and came out on the opposite end and hence we didnt know there was another exit where you will see rows of rentals of hanbok. We went into the palace expecting to rent hanbok for the children and realized they were outside (we saw many of them when we left). Would be nice if there is a notice board or something where they can inform us where to go for the rental. If you are coming out of the palace, turn to your left towards the station. when you hit the first traffic light, you will see lots of rental shops opposite. That's the place to rent your hanbok for photo taking. The palace itself was nice but probably I was expecting more. The palaces look pretty much alike and nothing much to see for us. Probably they do not have a richer and older history as China. We practically walk everywhere in the compound and our last stop was the library where you will have to take your shoes off and be real quiet! I don't think I enjoyed unless there was an event there. If not, I think its worth to skip it unless you really want to dress in your hanbok and walk under the hot sun (yes we went in June)!"
Beautiful palace ,This is a massive beautiful palace. I would highly recommend a guided tour as there are not many signs explaining what everything is. 
Its original and comfy,"this place was quiet comfy for me but it made me sleepy being here for 1 hours. i like the environment, very clean and nice. "
"Went with a tour group, got very lost!","Stick with your tour guide cos I got lost! Luckily they were able to bring the bus round to get me but still... it’s a beautiful place with lots of history and culture. We arrived in time to see the guard changing ceremony which was great, and there’s a lot to see. A must see if you visit Korea!"
Free Entry,"A must visit for first time visitors. Gyeongbokgung Palace is grandest of all the other palaces in Seoul. Built in the heart of Seoul with a beautiful lake, surrounded by mountains. Guard changing ceremony (guards dressed in Korean traditional costumes) was a real pleasure to watch and gives you an opportunity to experience Korean tradition. Great place to capture gorgeous pictures of the scenery and architecture. Free guided tours in English are available at 11:00, 13:00, and 15:30.Quick Tip: 1. Integrated Ticket of Palaces can help you save money if you wish  to visit multiple palaces in Seoul.  2. Wearing traditional Korean dress “Hanbok” will grant you free entry  into the palace"
Get your gears for the kids and camera! This palace area is huge!,"We went here with 3 children aged 7, 4 and 1. The palace itself is really gonna bring you hundreds of years back to the times of the royals of Korea. A huge area to explore, and definitely you must explore and take pictures at every corner of the area because of its picturesque surroundings. My kids were quite tired of us stopping and taking pictures, thank God we brought strollers with big tyres (the palace lawn is mostly of white pebbles) thus it was easier to push. You can also rent a hanbok here (apparently every young visitors do that!) and your instagram worthy pics taken, lol. Do check the weather. I had my pic taken on a great sunny day. Thus the pic of me with the palace as the background was made more memorable with strings of cloud and very blue sky.Don't forget to wait for the guard changing march. I think it's at 2-3 pm. Worth the wait!"
what a wonderful,"visiting the final night opening in this year 2018. lots of people are there. so fantastic and beatiful palace. Keep remins that when you want to visit here, should buy ticket in advance through Internet. 정말 멋지고 꼭 한번은 봐야할곳. 올해의 야간개장은 끝났고 내년을 기약하며..일반개장도 야간못지않게 또 다른 느낌이니 꼭 한번 아니 두번 가보시길.입장권 예매는 필수. "
Beautiful!!,A must see attraction in Seoul. Got in free because it was a national holiday. Beautiful buildings. Lots of photo opportunities.
Historical Castle in the Middle of modernised city,"You can go there by subway. Just the subway line 4 to Chungmuro and transfer to line 3 to Gyeongbukgong station. Then, walk towards the exit 5 to reach the palace.The entrance fee to Gyeongbukgong Palace 3,000KRW per person. There were many teenagers and couples visiting there by wearing hanbok and took memorable picture. Inside the castle site there guided English speaker who will assist you in the castle tour. The castle area was large. Make sure to wear proper shoes. You can also visit National Palace Museum of Korea. The admission is free. There are exhibitions of traditional clothing and architecture of royal family history. You can relax in the air-conditioning building while learning the Korean history. There are also free access to clean lavatory and free water to drink in the museum. Overall experience visiting there was good."
Majestic in all aspects,Easily accessible by subway. You can almost imagine how they lived back in the days. It is a good thing that they are preserving the palace. 
Desapointed,"Nothing special. Not real good things, just buildings from the XX century but old style. If possible, go somewhere else..."
Beautiful,"Amazing palace in centre of seoul. Got some great shots, especially of moutains one side, modern skyscrapers the other. Lots of english friendly exhibits and helpful staff. Plenty to see for an afternoon/ half day. A real must see for any first time visitor to Seoul."
Beautiful palace,Get there early and watch the changing of the guard at 10:00. Wander around for a while and see the old buildings.
There are free tours,"We loved this place. It is very big, its not only one palace but a series of royal palaces and gardens as well. You should allow about two hours at least to see it all. and it was so great that when we arrived we found out there was a free English tour every hour o half hour, which takes over one hour. The guide was a really nice Korean girl and she took us to the most important parts of the palace and gave us very very interesting explanations about the life there, the architecture, etc. After the tour is done she recommends you to go to the rest of the places in the palace complex - its huge, but we already learned some background about it. There are two museums very close to the palace, so it may take even half a day to see it all. Definetely worth visiting. "
History directly in Seoul,"If you want to experience history in modern Seoul, you have to go here. Korean history comes alive while you wander the extensive grounds. My tip is to come here during the Chuseok Holidays"
Royal Guard Changing Ceremony,"Lovely Palace with a colourful Royal Guarding Changing Ceremony every day at 10:00 and 14:00, except tuesdays . Don´t miss it. In the middle of a hightech city, an ancestral ceremony."
Seoul: Gyeongbokgung Palace,"This is a ""MUST-SEE"" if you ever come to Seoul! I am a huge fan of architecture, and you will find exquisite designs here. The grounds are vast, and you could walk around for hours, which is what I did and loved every meter of it! The history here and what was told to me by my girlfriend was simply incredible! Oddly enough, she had never been and yet lives in Seoul, lol. You must dedicate at least a couple of hours to explore this wonderous place and even go into the museum if you find yourself with some extra time. Also, the gardens are just fantastic!"
Beautiful,"Love it love it love it ... picture perfect, truely enjoyed. Its like going back in time, visiting the golden era."
Great but crowded,"I booked a tour including a stop here through Viator. It was great to get to know about the history of the place and also see the changing of the guards at 10 am. It’s a huge area with many buildings. In many ways similar to the Forbidden City in Beijing. Note that there is free access on the last Wednesday of every month. But also expect lots of tourists all the other days. It’s located close to the other palace, in walkable distance but don’t plan both on the same day as I recommend you the guided tour of the Secret Garden which starts at 10.30 am. It is possible to book another time online, though, but I found it fine to take one palace at a time."
Beautiful ,"If you are in Seoul, this is a must-go place. Beautiful, beautiful palace. Big compound. Join the guided tour to understand its history better. You can easily spend 3 hours here. "
Nice place to visit,You need to come here if you’re planning to visit SeoulJust a ‘must visit’ area. Not more than that i think
A step back in history.,"To learn about South Korean history, there is nothing better than this amazing palace. We didn't book a tour but we did it ourselves. Before the visit, we had to document ourselves to learn about this amazing country Every step took us to the hidden gems of this palace. We had a great time. There is a small admission fee. But if you rent the costume, you don't have to pay anything. The costume itself speaks volumes about the Korean traditions, customs and way of life. It's worth the visit."
Nice palace,Spent time here on my first day and it was worth seeing. Very big and in the centre of places to see for tourists.
5 days in Seoul,Excellent place to visit when in Seoul. If you speak English they offer free tours in English 2 or 3 times a day. Check times before going. You do have to admission fee unless you are 65 or older. Tour last about 1 hour. You can spend some additional time on your own.
Very Historical,"Nice place to educate foreigners of a part of the history of korea. We were with a guided tour and it was pretty awesome to know a lot about the story of the palace, and the royalty. "
Tradition in the heart of a modern world,"This is good place to learn about the Korean culture and history. It is in the heart of Seoul and is an expansive place to walk around so wear good walking shoes. The buildings are preserved well, and the grounds are well-maintained. It is nice to see some of the people dressed up in the traditional costume so you feel like you were there in the old days."
Nice place,"One of palace you should visit when you came to seoul. i visited the palace wearing their traditional Korean costume,they called it ""Hanbok"". their place very nice especialy on spring season. their entrance fee is free if you go inside the palace wearing hanbok."
Görülmeli!- a must see,"Türkçe: Burayı mutlaka gezmelisiniz. Buranın en önemli saray yerleşkesi.You should definitely see this place. If you visit here in september, they have thanksgiving holiday. It is free and you can see people with traditional clothes"
Gyeongbokgung,Good educational things kids can learn and some kinds of activities they can experience. Yuo could have some life time good pictures.
Better to visit with traditional costume,The beauty of this palace is beyond question. We visited the palace with the traditional Korean costume. At the beginning I was very skeptical about this idea but it turned out to be a unique experience. Then I figured out there were about 5% visitors dressing the same so we didn't look strange at all. It is definitely memorable to walk in the ancient palace with this costume!
Must visit Palace,Korea’s main palace. Walk The whole vicinity for half a day. Worth it to have a feel of the Korean imperial culture 
Skip the changing guards performance in exchange for a quiet stroll,"What we can admire currently is the result of the modern day government's great effort of rebuild / restoration because like too many other historical sites in Korea it was unfortunately heavily destroyed by Japan in various invasions throughout the centuries.This main palace is quite large and nice, many interesting things to see - except the changing guards performance which we found ordinary and boring. Skip it during the performance times than you will have the palace to yourself quietly : )"
So amazing and free ,I think that it’s a best free thing about Seoul! You will enjoy Korean culture and spirit of the old city. Buildings are so beautiful and mountains near it looks great
A very nice and huge palace,"The palace, I must say, is quite huge that weren’t able to visit the whole place. So many picture-worthy spots everywhere especially if you’re a fan of KDrama. "
Forbidden city - mark two ,"Located in the centre of the city, this is easy to walk to from most hotels with the added benefit of escaping modern life as soon as you walk in to the outer courtyard.The buildings are stunning, changing of the guard ceremony is something to watch and a must for photographers and tourists alike."
Amazing,I loved visiting this palace. They have free guided tours and you can make reservations at the website.
Tour of Gyeongbokgung Palace,"While visiting Seoul in September 2018, My husband & I took one hour free English tour provided by the palace. I believe they provide two English tours per day. The tour schedule was posted in the ticket office. We enjoyed the tour very much & learned about not only a part of Korean history but also current cultural historical connections. I am glad we took the tour. We also watched a change of guard ceremony which I wasn’t too impressed with. Overall it was a nice 1/2 day tour at the palace."
Great cultural experience,"This is my second visit and learned more each time I visit, The gardens at the back were closed off this time due to some renovations,but still a lot of area to cover that is still open to public, "
Very nice palace ,"Don’t visit it in summer because really hot, it’s open palace but u can’t go in just see it from outside, entrance fee cost 3$ , their are 2 show changing guard 1 out palace 2 in palace "
Excellent ,Interesting location to visit and take photos. I recommend to rent their costumes and take photos there
Beautiful! ,It is definitely worth stopping by and do try to see the changing of the guards around 10am any day other than Tuesday.
Great attraction ,A must see when in South korea.They have the exchange in guards ceremony that is entertaining. Great tour if you are into palaces. 
Great Historical Palace ,This was a great experience! The palace grounds are large. Easy to get around and English guide and tours available!
Beautiful palace,"This is the first and grandest of the palaces in Seoul. You may rent a hanbok just outside the palace. If you wear a hanbok, the entrance fee is waived. It was very nice taking our pictures wearing the hanbok in the different very picturesque buildings, hallways, and walls. They have a changing of the guard ceremony in the morning. Unfortunately, we were not able to watch it. This is the palace you must visit when you are in Seoul. It was really fun posing like K-drama actors."
Beautiful in Autumn,The palace is beautiful so well kept and the weather for me was also perfect. there was so much to see and do and the entrance fee was so cheap too!it was just at the change of autumn and the colours were amazing no tree or plant was the same shade! the changing of the guard is fabulous to watch so many people gathered to see it
"Great price, great place!","The price was around 1-2usd.The amount of places to see and hang around is pretty big and very beautiful views!Comparing to nearby palaces this one is the best value for money. If you want to watch the guard's changing ceremony it's actually outside of the paying zone.There are toilets and cafeteria, nearby is a free of charge museum."
Make sure you see the change of the guard ,"We visited on a Wednesday and the palace was quite busy. It is a very good experience to see this palace. There are many people dressed in the traditional Korean attire which is lovely to look at and get some photos of.The queue for the tickets wasn’t bad at all, only 5 minutes long.Tickets very reasonably priced! Equivalent of 5 Euro for a ticket.There are many areas to walk around and explore within the palace boundaries.All buildings have explanations in English and Korean which was nice to be able to understand.The changing of the guard happens at 2pm and is a must see! It is directly inside the gates and does get very busy for this so be sure to be there 10 minutes before to get the best view.A lovely day exploring traditional ancient Korea."
"Huge palace to walk around, enjoy and photograph ",In my opinion this is the most remarkable place on your trip to Seoul. You get a feel for how korea used to be in past and it's very easy to get here using the subway. Check the closing times though as i believe it closes around 5pm most the time .
Back to the ancient time,"Although the current palace is not the original one, we still enjoy the ancient atmosphere, the magnificent structure. Highly recommend to make a visit in the autumn, when all the ginkgo trees turn to magic yellow and all the palace sinks in a very romantic atmosphere. You also can hire a Hanbok, dress up, walk in the palace and let your imagination go through back the ancient time!"
Beautiful palace in the middle of city,Beautiful palace grounds - views are spectacular with the mountains forming the backdrop to the palace. Lots of photo opportunity places as long as you are able to find a time when there will be less crowds. 
Going back through time,"The Palace was magnificent and the area is quite huge. We rented a Hanbok ( traditional korean attire ) We wore it roaming around and it feels like going back through time. it will also save you from paying for palace entrance and going thru long queing lines going inside. We were also lucky to witness the changing of the palace guards. There was a traditional ceremony, guards were wearing korean warrior outfits. We were also amaze with the structures of the palace and easily appreciated the korean culture. Must see at seoul. "
Huge ! But nobody actually speaks English!,"I will wrote down my bad experience here, we went here without expecting the place would be that huge, we wore hanbok ( since you'll get free admission) and took pictures inside the area , half an hour later we left, we didn't explore the whole area ) and I just realized that I lost my phone, I ran back to find it but it's gone, I asked the securities and almost no one speaks english ! I found it's very irritating becuase it's one of the first tourist destination and nobody speaks english! the lady in the security guard told me to go back to the first gate which I already went to and they couldn't help me, and they didn't do anything to check if someone found my phone, at the end somebody told me that her nephew found my phone and HAND IT TO THE LOST AND FOUND COUNTER! it irritated me most because that means they didn't even checked the lost and found counter ( that is hiding behind the dessert counter ) . The attarction itself is nice, spare your time becuase it's huge, if you rent hanbok make it at least 2,5 hours so you can wear them around the cultural village as well. But if you need help , embrace yourself since nobody speaks english to help you."
Nice place to visit,We went here before the Changing of the Guards ceremony and there were a lot of people already. Better to visit wearing a hanbok to truly feel the ambiance of the place and of course for pictorial sessions. :) I would love to visit again!
"Massive structures and ground areas to explore, but not in the middle of summer!","While interesting to explore, not much areas to take cover for a quick respite from the searing heat of summer. Changing of guard ceremony is a sight to watch, but times and length of ceremony depends on the weather. Ticket is good for one entry only. If you come out to watch the changing of guard ceremony from exploring the palace, you will not be allowed to get in again unless you buy a new ticket, so be careful. Massive structures of palaces and other buildings, all replicas. Still, an experience not to miss when in Seoul."
Must see,My first Palace in Seoul and of course a must see. The guards are a bit over the top but the Palace is great to wander around. It has a filmic atmosphere with the mountain background. Consider going in on the north side and walk down to the main entrance.
Nice palace,"Nice place, pool and park inside. Near the mountain. Fresh air and for relax..Easily accessed by metro."
Must do,It is worth to wander and see all the areas around. Everything is well protected. Some buildings have rooms furnished and set up to give one a glimpse of how daily life was conducted in this palace.There are 2 museums that are worth visit as well.
nice place ,"i habe several times visit and each time have recognized different point. do not expect alot, so simple and quite, no luxry but let you to feel strenght"
Grand Palace,"Very well-maintained palace. This is one of the 5 major palaces available for tourists in South Korea and I think the one that’s most accessible. There are 2 main entrances to this palace, we went through the entrance outside of the National Folk Museum of Korea, which was free, so you can also visit that place before going to the palace itself. "
Enormous!,"This palace just goes on and on. Many people arrive in traditional dress which really adds to the experience even if you don’t dress up yourself. The palace is similar to other East Asian ones if you have visited China for example. Opportunity to indulge in a royal afternoon tea, or visit the folk museum (fee). Alternatively go into the Royal Palaces Museum right next door.Great way to spend a morning."
Impressive but too hot to visit in the summer!,"If you have a choice, do not visit in the summer... it is way to hot. In any case we enjoyed as much as possible and there was a nice museum at the end of the palace which was interesting."
Imperial Joseon,"Built in 1395, the Gyeongbokgung Palace is arguably the most cherished of South Korea’s many heritage sites. It is similar to Beijing’s Forbidden City, but at a slightly smaller scale. However, do not let this scale comparison confuse you, this palace and its grounds are quite expansive and should rightfully take at least half a day to visit properly. The complex has been extensively and lovingly restored following destruction by and expulsion of the Japanese during WWII. It is currently a museum (Korea’s imperial family is long gone), the grounds of which also contain the National Folk Museum. This is a must-see while visiting the South Korean capital."
Must go,"This was such an amazing trip, anyone who is going to seoul must visit the palace and village, it takes a few hours to walk around the palaces but so worth the walk, make sure to find the information guide and get a map off them because you'll definately need it."
Attractive architecture,"You will know you are at the correct place once nearby.. There would be A LOT of people dressed in traditional Korean costumes walking all over inside and out. You can rent these at shops nearby, ranging from 7500 Won to 15000 Won. With these costumes, you would get free entrance to the palace. If you do not want to play dress up, there is a small entrance fee. After entering the front gates, you will soon see the main congregation hall. Surrounding it is a vast area mixed with other palace buildings and a nice garden and lake. It would take up to a whole day to cover the entire area. Very picturesque."
Great starting location for exploring Korea,"I'd highly recommend starting your stay in Seoul at Gyeongbokgung Palace. It's very picturesque and takes you back to another time. Also, it was very interesting seeing the Blue house nearby with all the security guards at the end of my exploration of Gyeongbokgung! Also, it's near Bukchon Hanok Village, which shows a bunch of traditional Korea houses. Prime location to start your exploration!"
A must visit place,"one of the beautiful palaces. Huge and probably will take most of your day.The tickets are cheap and if you wear korean dress, then its free entry.Change of guards is good but not as good as Buckingham palace, London"
Historical,I personally love the garden of the palace. It's a huge palace located at the centre of the city. Even though there were many tourists but it doesn't feel crowded due to huge size of the place. 
Try on guard costume! View of Blue House!,"A lot of people don't know that you can try on the guard costume for free right after the Changing of the Guard ceremony. There's this building on your left once you enter through the main Gwangwhamun gate that appears to be closed during the Changing of the Guard. Once it ends, there are women in hanbok who come and open this building. You can choose which costume you want to wear. The building is only open for a very short time (maybe only for 30 minutes?) and you cannot wear the costumes to go into the palace. You don't have to pay anything though, and you can take pictures using the gate and the palace as a backdrop.We were there on a Monday morning to catch the Changing of the Guard ceremony. It was quite a long walk from the Gyeongbokgung subway station (give 10-15 mins allowance). I didn't really understand a lot of what was going on despite the loudspeakers, but the Changing of the Guards looked pretty interesting. You could take pictures with the guards in front of the gate after the ceremony.There are free English tours offered at certain times, but we chose to do a self-tour. We were there for less than two hours, and only chose to check out certain parts after the Changing of the Guard - the Throne Room, the two pavilions, and a bit of wandering around the other parts. You can easily spend a whole morning or afternoon here, considering they also have a free museum inside the palace. A lot of people came dressed in hanbok, and it was admirable to see them as the weather was pretty hot and stifling when we were there end of July!You can catch a glimpse and take a photo of The Blue House coming from within Gyeongbokgung Palace. Keeping the Hyangwonjeong Pavilion walls (the two-story hexagonal pavilion that's currently walled up as of July 2018) on your right, and the Jibok-jae building in front of you, keep walking until you see a gate with guards on your left. (The gate is closest to the Jibok-jae building within the Palace, and is on the north area of the palace complex.) Go out through the gate, and you'll see a larger gate with guards on your right. You can go out to take a photo of The Blue House across the road, but be sure to keep your Gyeongbokgung entrance ticket with you as you re-enter Gyeongbokgung!"
Want for a short visit,"Went for a short visit as it was way too cold.. Was - 13 that day. Didn't not manage to go for the free guide tour as well but we managed to catch the changing guards ceremony, it was magnificent. Overall quite a nice place to visit. "
A step into the past ,"This palace is definitely a step into the past in Seoul. The palace is really big though, you'll probably need at least 3 hours to explore, or even 5 hours! It's really big but it is so beautiful. You can learn about the history of the palace while admiring the beauty of it! "
Magnifique!!!,First it is a perfect mix between the modern city and the culture and traditional buildings. Is some of the most interesting points from Seoul 
Don't miss the changing of the guard,"The changing of the guard at Gyeonngbokgung palace is a lot of fun. It's easy to get a good viewing spot and take photos. The ceremony itself is colorful and lively. The best part is when it's over, you're allowed to take photos with the participants."
old place in a new surrounding,"be sure to visit this palace - the first and main of all palaces own by the chosen dynasty.lots of people walking in traditional Korean clothe, the place is really big and interesting to see some Asian traditions."
Pretty setting with lots of buildings to wanter,"We enjoyed touring this palace, though it should be noted that most of it has been rebuilt in the last decade or so. The experience was enhanced by the tourists dressing up in local costume and floating about."
Great place to visit,"Even on a hot day, you'd still want to visit the place to see the sights, the intricate designs, the culture and it's great for picture taking. There were a lot of people but the place is big enough to go around. You'd definitely should put this on your itinerary."
Palace,"One of the larger palaces to see. Lovely grounds, with ponds and greenery to stroll through. The changing of the guards is especially interesting. 2 Korean Museums are on the same grounds and we enjoyed them also."
A must see Palace in Seoul!,"It was a very hot day when we visited, but it's so worth it. My kids rented the traditional Korean costumes (Hanbok) before entering the palace. It's free admission if you are wearing Hanbok. The place is huge, we visited a few of the main buildings, very beautiful paintings/decor. Lots of places to take good photos. You can get there by subway with a short walk, it's definitely worth a visit!"
A cultural must see,"First some top tipsClosed on Tuesdays ( well it was when we went)We wanted to see the changing of the gaurd at 10.00 hrs - it starts very promptly. Stand on the right hand side to watch, as you are near the drum and effectively everything marches by twice as they leave the parade square.Best tip, last Wednesday of every month is Korean culture day..........its free!!!!!!!!!Geat place with good history, we took a free English speaking tour. This met at 11.00 hrs inside the second gate on the right. There is a meeting post you can see as you go in. This was very beneficial.Gaurds I am told are actors rather than military. Beards all look great........from a distance.Nice clean toilets in the museum , housed in a modern building on the far left of the first main square where the changing of the gaurd takes place."
A lot to do,"i went there during winter, the lake was frozen, there was snow everywhere on the land because last night of my visit day was snowing so it was so beautiful. there, you can take a lot of pictures, it is the largest palace, just a very historical place, i would recommend other to go to this palace first, and then go to the gwanhwamun, take a picture of king sejong, walk down to cheonggyecheon stream (make sure, you check the festival event, there may be a lantern festival at night ). it is a lot of walking and please wear sneakers. then take a lunch and go to the bukchon hanok village."
Largest palace in Seoul,"Gyeongbokgung used to be the main palace of the Joseon dynasty and out of the different palaces in Seoul, it is definitely larger and grander in scale.The palace is consisted on several areas. The main grounds is where the throne room is situated, with a huge surrounding plaza and gates. This is the most crowded area as many people would want to take photos here and being here makes you feel like you're in a historical drama.There are many smaller areas to explore around the main palace if you're a history buff and if you want a more in depth explanation, do check their website for guided tours.It takes about an hour to three hours to cover the entire area depending on how thorough you want to be and your walking speed, but this place is well worth the visit. While not as mystical as the Changdeokgung Palace, Gyeongbokgung is the palace to visit if you can only visit one palace on Seoul.There are two cafes in the palace grounds as well and visitors need to pay an entrance fee. If you have the time (1-2 days), I strongly suggest getting the Palace Pass at 10,000 won that allows you access to the notable palaces and shrines in Seoul."
Lots. Of walking,"Beautiful complex, georgeous painting, very reaonably priced but go before you have spent a lot of time walking already-the complex is huge and you can walk for 2 or 3 hours"
My first visit in a traditional Korean palace,"The place is magnificent, building impressive with color and artistic details. People were wearing traditional beautiful Korean costumes.Changing of the guard was an attraction.This place transported me in ancient times.Thank you!"
Beautiful place!,Wonderful to come and visit for a couple of hours. Definitely not to be missed if on a trip to Seoul. 
Good ,Must see place in Seoul. Lots of history. Good for taking pictures. Add it easily to your itinerary when in the area. A bit too hot in August though as little shade. 
Pretended to be Korean Princess for 2 hours,"Gyeongbokgung Palace located in the buzzling area of Seoul. However it keeps the tradition such as changing guard activity. The admissions is 3000 Won, but it is free for those who wear hanbok, the Korean traditional costume. So I chose the experience of wearing hanbok, pretending to be a Korean Princess while going around the palace. It was quite enjoyable although for only 2 hours, as we went there in summer and it was really hot inside hanbok :)"
So authentic,Please come here and you can pose around the palace. Just take note that they have few gates. If you're not coming from the front gate make sure to ask the guard how you can go to the front gate. I was quite lost at that time don't forget to rent your hanbok!
Beautiful Tourist Spot,Excellent destination for tourists to experience South Korean culture and history. Visited during the summer weather and it made for a spectacular day out exploring the palace and learning about South Korean history. Lots to see and experience including cultural performances
Tourist must visit,"Cannot say that I was absolutely astonished by the palace, but it is a tourist must visit in Seoul.To make experience more fun, make sure you rent traditional Korean costumes and wear them around. There are plenty of places nearby + you get free entry to the palace! "
Lovely Palace,"One of the great things about Seoul is that the old and new are within reach in the capital. You will pay a small fee to get into the palace but it is worth doing. Due to proximity, consider doing Changdeokgung Palace and Bukchon village at the same time."
pretty place,The palace is pretty though a bit bare compared to Indian and European palaces. The walk around the gardens was a delight. 
REALIZATION OF K-DRAMA SCENES,"I was visiting Gyeongbokgung to make the K-Drama scene I watch every single week comes true. The palace is so traditional and ethnical, and we could take pictures with traditional Hanbok (but remember that the Hanbok should be rented outside Gyeongbokgung Palace area)."
Visit,It was such a pretty place.. could spend a few hours walking in the palace grounds. However it would be more helpful if there were more information written in English as language can be an issue sometimes though people are very polite it's difficult to get your point across.
Beautiful Palace Complex - Free admission free admission for seniors !,"Visited gorgeous Gyeongbokgung Palace in August 2018 and was wowed by the beauty and size of the complex. First of all, our visit was enhanced through a free guided tour arranged prior to our arrival to Seoul with the City of Seoul Walking Tour. The guide met us near the ticket booth at 10 am, just in time to watch the change of guards ceremony. The guide spoke excellent English and was very knowledgeable about the palace and Korean history. Better yet , there was only one other couple in addition to us. So it was almost like a private guided tour - sure beats the regular tour from the palace. We were also pleasantly surprised that when we asked about senior discount admission tickets, we were asked to show identification documents (and we only had with us Ontario driver’s licenses), the ticket lady gave us free admission tickets. What generosity, even for foreigners!Most of the Gyeongbokgung buildings were beautifully reconstructed and maintained. The complex was one of the best palaces that I have visited in my travels, especially the Heungnyemun Gate 興禮門，the Geunjeogjeon (Throne Hall, 勤政殿), and Gyeonghoeru (Royal Banquet Hall, 慶會楼）with its beautiful pond and gardens. Our guide knew all the intricacies of the various buildings, how they were used, the best angles to take pictures and the different stone sculptures. It was a very interesting tour. We ended the tour at the rear gate of the palace after the emperor’s library and had a view of the current Korean Presidential Blue House. Don’t miss this palace and take advantage of the generosity of the City of Seoul!"
Breathtaking,"Due to time restraints I was only able to stop by for one of the guard-changing ceremonies, but wow! Highly recommended; it's a wonderful opportunity to take-in part of Seoul's rich history, and if you're able to actually go in and see the palace it will undoubtedly be worth it. A must-see on any trip to Seoul."
Great Historical Site that is MUST SEE,"Amazing great experience - you should see the changing of the guard. Bring an umbrell , fan and or hat as this is a sun soaked experience. I must have lost 2 lbs of water weight seeing this great ceremony. We were on a tour for this which is good as they could explain all the nuances of the site"
Aug visit ,"I had a personal guide with me but you could totally do this solo! The change of guards happens at 10am and they have Korean, Chinese, Japanese and English explanations of what is going out throughout the whole process. You prob just need to spend 2 hours here MAX if not less! But I’ve been to China’s Forbidden City Palace already so I wasn’t as wow-ed but it was still a good place to check out and also hit up the museum (exit 5 of the Gyeongbokgung Station - gives some good info and also great to have a break from the heat. Same exit to visit the palace. It wasn’t overly crowded at this time. After we cabbed it to Bukchon Hanok Village after to check out the old style houses and had lunch at insadong after. They are all close-ish but I wouldn’t walk in summer so just cab/uber it. "
Must to see,It’s mandotary to see. A ceremony is done in the enterance at 10:00. It’s a pleasure to watch. You have to spend at least two hours to visit. 
Great history and architecture,"This is one of the most important places to visit when in Seoul. The palace has a lot of interesting history and is full of beautiful old buildings and there is even a cafe and gift shop.The most interesting part is watching the changing of the guard so try to be there when it happens. The guards are dressed in colourful blue and red uniforms and mustaches and beards (they look fake) and the event is pretty interesting and one needs to show respect and not get up in the faces of the guards.All around the palace on the main road and small alleys are shops that hire out traditional costumes for visitors to wear in and around the palace. So inside the palace grounds you can see lots and lots of especially girls wearing these colourful costumes and posing for photos. There are far less men wearing these outfits.I visited the palace on a very hot day and fortunately had a cap with me otherwise I would have been cooked.This is really nice place to visit, nothing compared to the Forbidden City in Beijing, but still an impressive place to visit and spend a couple of hours."
Gyeongbokgung Palace Seoul Korea,Nice place to walk around and visit the different chambers... It is nice to have a guide to explain the history...
History,"If you like history you should visit gyeongbokgung palace, you can see royal guard performances and learn about korean history. You should allocate sufficient time to enjoy the palace."
One of the most top attractions in Seoul,This historical palace is one of the most popular attractons in Seoul. Royal guard performances occur several times a day during opening hours and are worth watching. There is also a large pond within the inner palace grounds. Overall the palace is beautiful but crowded with tourists.
TOP 10 Seoul places of interest ,"Should be on your bucket list when in Seoul, large premise so do allocate sufficient time to slowly enjoy what the place have to offer. Tend to get crowded during public holidays "
History and Tradition of a Modern city,Great value of Korean Culture and Tradition dates back to thousand years.History lovers will definitely enjoy this gigantic palace with great views and excellent architecture
Have been several times,"This was actually the first major attraction I visited upon moving to Korea almost five years ago. I have been several times since; most recently in the spring of 2018. It is of great historical significance and also never seems to end. However, it is also overrun with tourists. Especially on weekends."
A slice of Korea’s history ,"The main and largest royal palace built during the Joseon dynasty, Gyeongbokgung Palace takes you back in time to see how it was like during those days from visiting the on-grounds museums or even trying on a traditional hanbok for photo taking and the experience! Do check the timings for the changing of the guards for an interesting show as well :)"
Traditional,If you're visiting make sure you're there in time for the changing of the guards ceremony. That was lovely to see. The palace grounds are massive and requires a lot of walking. There was a lot of tourists around so be prepared for the crowds. 
A brief history of Korea in a few hours!,"Awesome complex of palaces, temples, lakes and gardens! A visit here is a must for any traveler! I had the chance to visit Gyeongbokgung during cherry blossom season, and it was simply magnificent!"
WONDERFUL PLACE TO VISIT,"Those who are exploring SEOUL this palace is a wonderful option, Half Day Trip will educate you about the history of Korea."
Awesome,If you are in Korea you must visit Gyeongbokgung Palace for sure. The guard change attraction is very amusing as well as Korean girls wearing hanbok. You will get the feel of Joseon era in every corner of the Palace
excellent place,I like the place because it is historic and well designed and have beautiful buildings and landscape
Massive Palace,"Massive palace, maybe going in the heat of august was not a good idea, but overall it was a nice experience to visit"
Great History,Great history here. If you get a chance take a tour and you will learn stuff that you would not know by just walking around.
Gyeongbokgung Palace,"I've visited this before and went again with a friend. While it was hot when we went (mid-July) it was a nice trip. Various areas were being renovated while we were there. There are signs in several languages (to include English) which explain what each building or object is. There is a museum attached to the grounds which is nice to visit. If you go in the summer, bring a hat and water. There is underground parking but is limited in the number of spots. The cost to enter is reasonable but you will need Korean Won. "
Great!,"Definitely worth visiting, very beautiful palace. Entrance is cheap, free if dressed in Hanbok. free English tour was great too. Informative but not too long."
Amazing place in Seoul,"it's already my second time visiting, but still amazed by its design and construction. Strongly recommended to spend at least a couple of hours inside and around that neighborhood. Worthy of checking in."
Amazing Palace for Explore History of Seoul,Big Palace and Amazing Palace. And if we came at 10.00 or 14.00 we can looking change guardian. Near from Subway Station. If we came with hanbok they will give us free entry. 
Educational Experience,"The palace visit was very fun and education. Renovations had not changed the palace completely, so you can still enjoy and look at ancient history, culture and style influence of Seoul. Definitely worth going there for a full day, and easily accessible by metro, taxi and bus."
A must in Seoul,It's a must visit if you're new to Seoul. This amazing palace (the main palace in the latter part of the Choseon Dynasty) becomes even more beautiful in the clear blue sky days. Indeed a green haven in the heart of the city.
A leisure stroll in history,This is a beautiful and peaceful palace of historic significance. Save your taxi money and simply take the subway there - very easy and direct. I would also recommend going as early as possible to avoid the noisy tour groups. The palace opens at 9 am. Bring a parasol if it's summer and drinking water as there is very limited shade available. There are free guided tours available but I recommend either hiring an audio guide or purchasing a guide book for 500 Won - you can then visit at your leisure. A good solid hour of walking the site and returning to the courtyard in front of the palace at 10 am will allow visitors to watch a re-enactment of the changing of the guards. While the process is not exciting - the pageantry and costumes are beautiful!
Beautiful Palace,"This palace has a very large area which is divided into several parts. The front of the palace as in the palace there are generally guard guards where tourists can take photos and if we are lucky we can witness the procession of replacing the palace guards.The middle part is the king's palace which is not too big but magnificent. Then on the side of the palace there is a very large garden, very beautiful and very suitable for relaxation. Tourists can relax in this area.In general this palace has a high historical value for the population of South Korea. and as information if the diatric straight line, this palace has a straight line with Seoul Tower or Namshan Tower"
Free Admission when wearing a Hanbok (Korean traditional attire),"Gyeongbokgung is a must-see for anyone who is traveling to Korea for its history and traditional culture. The palace grounds are wide and you can see various traditional buildings with traditional art that are perfect for artists and architect enthusiasts. Surrounding the palace are hanbok rental stores where you can rent beautiful hanboks for about 2 hours for about 10,000 won. Considering that a basic hanbok is a few hundred thousand won, it's a great deal for those who just want to wear it for a day. It also gets you free entry into the palace (normal admission is 3,000 won for adults)."
Magnificent and lots of people wearing Korean costume,"Even in hot summer, there was lots people here. Some wore Korean traditional costume and took photos, with many of them were non-Korean. There is a subway station that can reach to it directly. There is a museum next to it and free of charges. A good place to hide from the strong sunshine for a while. With many big palace houses, a must go venue for costume photo taking. Better go earlier to avoid the crowds. But if you the guided tour in several languages, you need to go after lunch."
Gyeongbokgung Palace in the Autumn,"We went to Gyeongbokgung Palace in Autumn 2017. To enjoy the palace with fewer crowds, it is best to get there early in the morning if possible just when the gates opened at 9:00 am.Get your tickets from the main ticket booth just inside of the main Gwanghwamun Gate, to the right and grab one of the guide map brochures at the booth.Our walking trails was past the Gwanghwamun Gates to the Geunjeongjeon Hall is the main throne hall of Gyeongbokgung Palace. You are not allowed into the premise but you can take pictures from the outer side through the windows.Next would be the living quarters of the King and Queen -Gangnyeongjeon Hall, named after the virtue of health, served as the living quarters and resting area for the king and the Geoncheonggung Residence.Gyotaejeon Hall, located behind Gangnyeongjeon Hall, was the main living quarters and resting area for the queen. Head towards the Gyeonghoeru Pavilion supported by 48 stone pillars and set in a lotus pond, the pavilion was a favored place for the King to entertain visiting dignitaries. Interesting fact - A bronze dragon was discovered in the bottom of the pond below Gyeonghoeru Pavilion when it was drained for cleaning in November, 1997In what ever sequence you do get around, take the time to enjoy the little nuances of the palace. 1. The Haetae (A 'lion' guardian stone statue) - Upon seeing the haetae, all civilians are supposed to get down from their horses or carriages and continue to walk to Gwanghwamun Gate2.Net or fork-like tools on the roof tops to discourage birds from perching3. Notice the elevated footpath on the center which is reserved for the king.4.The court officials stands/sits by the stone marker that indicates their rank.5. The Metal Rings found near the store markers are actually tent ring to keep the tent in place for protection from sun or rain for the court officials waiting for the king.6.The palace uses Ondol system (traditional Korean floor heating). The floor is heated with smokes runway underneath it.7.The sun and moon painting that can be seen in each of the grand palace behind the King’s throne8. And with our basic feng shui, do enjoy the beauty of the palace which is located in an auspicious site with Namsan Mountain and Cheonggyecheon Stream in the front and Bugaksan Mountain at the backOperating Hours:March to October 09:00-18:00 / November to February 09:00-17:00Interpretation Services (1 hour):* English: 11:00, 13:30, 15:30* Japanese: 10:00, 12:30, 14:30* Chinese: 10:30, 13:00, 15:00Getting Here:Gyeongbokgung Station (Subway Line 3), exit 5.orGanghwamun Station (Subway Line 5), exit 2 and walk 400 meters."
The Palace,This was a lot of fun. beautiful place to visit. Inexpensive and friendly staff. It was the chinese new year when I went so everyone wore their formal attire whenever they were out. 
A must see,Interesting area just in the centre. For tourist free entrance with the national costume. You can rent your costumes nearby the palace.
Interesting gem,"It is inspiring to walk across the wide squares in front of the king's palace, or to take refuse from the intense summer heat in one of the minor houses, where doors leading to secret paths remain close and silent to the occasional visitor. "
Enormous Palace attraction including museums and more,"Seoul features a number of palaces dotted across the city, but Gyeongbokgung would have to be the most impressive in addition to being the most centrally located to other city highlights. The enormous grounds feature a number of buildings, gardens and pagodas, all stunningly presented. Locals and tourists add to the attraction by dressing in traditional Korean attire, which makes for great photos and a more authentic sense of time and place. Allow several hours to visit the site, as there is also an interactive museum of Korean history as well as a smaller children's museum (both included in the entry price) and the expansive area features plenty of pathways where you will discover totems and shrines. A number of cafes can be found throughout. The surrounding neighbourhood includes contemporary art galleries, history galleries and the Bukchon Hanok Village (traditional wooden houses)."
A must see,"This place is like Verseille in Paris, Schönbrunn in Vienna or the Empire State Building in NYC a must-see in Seoul. If you have time go inside and take a tour, it is a nice impression about the Korean culture."
Impressive Palace,Loved the palace! It played a fundamental part in the history of Seoul and South Korea. Beautiful place with over 7000 rooms. The place is extremely walking friendly and traditional with such neat architecture 
A great palace,The palace is a must see for ALL . Tickets needed to be bought from the right side after the main gate to be able to see the inside .U can also buy traditional uniforms and dresses to look like old fashioned Korean .We kept place and almost always crowded .
Nice place to visit!,The grounds were huge! Lots of walking and pls get a free English speaking guide(believe they are student volunteers) if your are a tourist. They are available at one of the exits from the metro. Lots of history and many photo opportunities. Many people rented hanboks to wear for taking photographs. It would have been a lot more pleasant if the weather was not so hot.(was 37 degrees when we were there) We were walking around looking for vending machines but there was none. Neither were there water coolers. We finally found a cafe near to the entrance. 
Scenic open palace in the middle of Seoul,One of several nice palaces in the north of Seoul. Close to Insadong but peaceful (apart from the occassional giant tour group)
Must see,"We were able to experience the changing of the guard, which was definitely worth seeing. Also sought refuge from a deluge of rain in the coffee shop, which was convenient! LOLSite is easy to navigate on your own, but may be more interesting with a (private) tour guide."
Very calming location amongst the bustle of Seoul,Lots of different parts to wander round and explore. This is a haven of peace and beauty in amongst a bustling city. Great if you have an hour to spend and are staying centrally.
Great palace,"Large, huge and beautiful. We have to spend min 2 hours to explore all the palace. Some attraction also good to watch."
Not amused,"This is the biggest of the 5 palaces of Seoul . Is really big and you will need like 2 hours to see it all, the most interesting part is the museum and the Chinese zodiac escultures. Another good thing is the free bathrooms but apart of that is very similar to the palaces of Japan or China, maybe the most interesting thing to see is the constant ""this building was destroyed by Japan"" comment. Finally , the main activity here is take amazing photos, I suggest to rent a traditional Korean dress and go crazy with the Instagram photos, check different prices for renting this clothes."
One of my favourate castles!,"This is a huge castle that is situated next to the Folk museum and other museums and it takes a lot of time to see it, especially if you like sitting around gazing at the constructions. Obviously there is an evening ticket, that is possibility to visit it at night, around 7 pm. This information is not available on the webpage. I found it out by coincidence. Very easy to reach. Bus 272 stops at it as well as the subway - line 3. Not far away from Insadong. "
Fascinating look at life,"Visited on a really hot day in summer. Be aware that there is little shade on the paths and none at the Changing of the Guard so bring sunscreen and an umbrella or cover up. We used the audio tour which was 5,000kw (you need to leave a form of ID as collateral). It was a good one because it paused until you indicated you were in the right area rather than it continue and you're struggling to get to the next spot. I think I would have preferred a tour with a guide though. I didn't feel like I got enough of the history from the audio tour. Keep walking right to the back of the Palace gardens to get a view of the Blue House (Korea's version of the White House).The highlight was the re-enactment of the Changing of the Guard so be sure to look up when that's on. I wish I had dressed up in the Hanbok (I had even found one that catered for bigger western sizes) but it was just too hot. I already suffered in the sun. Try the teas at the kiosk!! Yum but very sweet. It was very easy to get to the Palace on the Subway, a side pathway takes you straight there. "
Great place to visit a part of Joseon Dynasty!,Second time going here; this time with family. It's always a great place to go to appreciate the history of South Korea. Our family was lucky to enter without a fee when we went.
When history meets beauty,We enjoyed visiting the palace....honestly the place was out of this world....very quiet...green scenery a real flash from the past kind of an architectural building strongly recommend everyone to visit.
historical place,"this is a palace komplek in korea . beside the main palace there is a small palace nar gyengbokgun palace. actually its not a palace its a princess house. in this are you can rent a hanbok and sometime you can watch a guard changing position ""guard with koran traditional clothes like old times"". i forgot how much is the price bacause i wnet there with my tour group. but you can search on internet to see the price."
A lot of history in a great city,"Whether you are sensitive to history or not, this palace will please you. The guides are very attentive and will give you great anecdotes about the life of the royal Koreans at the height of this building. A must see!"
A must for the free transit tour!,I went here due to the free transit tour during my long layover in Korea. The palace itself is amazing and good thing that this iconic place is maintained very well. The place is huge hence maps or probably signages will be helpful for foreign people like me.
Seoul History,We spent a few hours walking around the palace grounds. It was much bigger than we expected but the architecture was beautiful and well kept. We had a 3 year old with us and he loved exploring the countless pathways until he got tired and opted to ride in the stroller. They had many ramps around the palace so the stroller was not a problem. Overall a very worthwhile place to tour in Seoul for a step back in to history.
A must see in Seoul,"If you want to do one touristy thing in Seoul, this is it. The big park surrounds the different part of the palace buildings which are nicely decorated.You need 1-2hours or more if you want. Nice to hang around in the park or you might visit the National Folk Museum Check the times for the changing of the guard, worth waiting for."
Very Beautiful,"very huge palace depend on your pace, need 1-2 hours to visit, and , enjoyed guard changing parade. we clicked snaps with palace guards, it was very nice experience. my children enjoyed a lot. "
Impressive,I really like the style and decoration of Korean palaces so enjoyed this highest one despite the heat of the day - - the complex of buildings covers many acres and there are huge courtyards open to the blazing sum in between buildings so may be best to avoid in the heat of the day. I visited on Sunday so as many as half of the visitors were wearing national dress adding to the experience. I understand that anyone can rent these as costumes at nearby shops for ~$20 and then receive free admission to the palace and plenty of photo ops. While I was there a quintet dressed in traditional clothes playing traditional music entertained for a while under a little grove of trees near the garden. Very nice! 
Overrated and Boring,"Compared to most our palace visit, this was uninspiring. I thought it would be much bigger, but the King's palace is very small. I don't get the barrier around the pond with windows to peek through to see the Pagoda, looks abandon. Aside from the entrance guards, there are nothing to interact with after the guards, just a few old buildings, you can walk through this in about an hour, will be bored after the palace. The most interesting thing was seeing all the Chinese tourists dressed in traditional attire walking around, we took pictures with a few. Need signage to describe what we are looking at, I rented the audio guide, without that, one would be clueless on what they are looking at. "
Iconic palace,This is my 4th visit to Seoul. Gyeongbokgong still a Must go place for 1st timer. Brought my friend there n she loves it at 1st sight.
A beautiful palace,"Like other people have stated, the entrance is free if you're wearing a hanbok and it was definitely worth it in my opinion. Me and my boyfriend both rented them (rent for one was 20000w for 4 hours in our case) and they were so beautiful. A lot of people are wearing them also so you don't have to be shy.The changing of the guard ceremony was imteresting to see. It was also explained in English, I am not sure if that's every time or if we were just lucky to be there at the right time though.The palace itself is very beautiful and the palace grounds is a very large area that you can easily spend a lot of time exploring. It is also cool when you look to the city and see the modern cityline outside of the historical palace wall. A mix of old and new.We also visited a traditional tea house inside the palace grounds and while it probably was more expensive than the tea places outside the grounds it was very nice. Their fruit tea was honestly one of the best I have ever tried."
Worth a Visit ,Watched the changing of the guards in the morning and then spent 90 minutes exploring the palace. It’s a must visit. Check the times for the changing of the guard. 
"Largest palace, the most popular",It is a must on your itinerary. You can easily spend half a day here. A large complex. The changing of guards ceremony is highlight and is a must see. (check the timings before visiting).
Don't miss this wonderful palace,"There are five palaces in Seoul and we decided to visit this one only. I think most of it has been reconstructed but there must have been about 100 buildings in the compound. It is good to get your photo with the guards by the main gate, probably the most photographed Koreans in the country. In several of the rooms there were displays of the people going about their business several hundred years ago. We spent about 3 hours at the palace and it was well worth while."
Excellent guided tour,We attended a guided tour in English. The guide made the tour extra interesting and funny. One of our top excursions on our Seoul journey. 
Still nice on a rainy day,"The day we went there was light rain. We still enjoyed walking around and taking pictures. We arrived early so it was not crowded. As we were leaving the crowds were arriving. I would add this to you list of ""must see"" items in Seoul."
Take the free guided tour,"The Royal palace in Seoul is a great attraction to visit, much has been written about the palace on TA. This is a huge complex of buildings and outdoor areas to explore, that is why I highly recommend taking one of the free guided tours which are offered daily in four languages, English, Korean, Japanese and Chinese, then after the tour wander around on your own. The tour lasts between 1-1.5 hours depending on the size of the group and the guide. Our guide was most informative as she lead our group of about twenty five around the complex. We were told many interesting stories and facts about the life in the Royal Palace, about family members, details of the architecture and general life in the palace. The Palace is inexpensive to visit, 3000 won/adult, but I believe if you come dressed in traditional Korean costume you can get in for free."
Beautiful palace with sad history,"Compare to the palaces in China, the size of the palace is small. But when you know the history, you will realize how valuable this palace is to Korean."
Nice Palace and Museum but very hot weather in July !!,Like the palace from the outside...it is a pity visitors are not allowed to look inside rooms inside the palace. But in July the weather is really hot even for us from tropical country ! It is definitely better to visit in spring or autumn season. We look around the palace just after a quick tour inside the museum.
Spectacular,The changing of the guard should not be missed. It was definitely a high light of our vacation. It was beautiful to see. The Palace was impressive and out tour guide was very informative in explaining the history and culture. So go with a guided tour!!!
Definitely worth a peek,"Many of the historical sites in S. Korea are rebuilt or refurbished, but they are beautiful all the same. They have a strong cultural tradition, much like their food traditions -- that are interesting and rich."
Architecture is Love,"The palace is about 2-3 blocks walk from the Anguk Train Station. Entrance is free is you're wearing a hanbok. We rented the dress for 18,000KWN. Prices depends on the design and you could get it for as low as 10,000KWN to around 25KWN. It was raining when we visited but they still allowed us to rent the hanbok. Make sure to hike up your skirt while walking to avoid getting the dress soiled (I ended up soiling it still though). If you want to see the exchanges of palace guards ceremony, make sure to be there around 9AM. The open area is good for taking photos with the palace as the background. A nice place for people who loves architecture, otherwise, there's ""nothing much"" for you to see as palaces would ""look the same"" in one way or another."
Great place for photographs ,"One of the best experience in Korea, it’s a must visit if you intend to west Korean hanbok especially to girls, lots of people wearing them around the palace, it’s not big but the environment is conducive enough for you to take photos without problems, you can rent the hanbok near the palace, I rented mine just next to the palace about usd$30++,A must visit if you are in Korea! "
WOW,We went at night. The place was amazing I could spend lots of time just looking at the detail. This is a very easy walk.
Very big palace ,This is a very old palace which was first built more than 600 hundred years ago. It was a residence for the Korean kings previously.It was destroyed and rebuilt again many times over the years. The builidngs are empty inside because most of the original furnitures and items were destryoed already.The palace has got very colorful exteriors. There are many courtyards inside. Big space and yards. Lots of tree.Very pleasant to walk around and take some nice photos. 
beautiful,its beautiful i recommend taking a tour as some of the signs are not in english so it is hard for non korean speakers to know the history of certain builsdinbgs
CIty Tour included Palace,"Palace is very vast and grand. but wrong timing for us as the weather was extremely hot.The changing of guard, while colourful, is not very pompous. should include more soldiers and perhaps horses, etc."
Beautiful palace!,Beautiful and grand palace. Make sure you catch the Changing of the Guards ceremony and take lots of photos! Its culturally rich and very colourful ceremony. 
Go for the free English guided tour!,"At 13h there is a free English guided tour which passes by the main buildings of the palace. Make sure to take the tour, because otherwise it is just a collection of old buildings and you have no clue where to look for or what their purpose was."
Could use some relics...,Gorgeously remade castle ruins. The only thing that would make it better would be adding more relics. Armor hanging from the walls? Ancient style outfits in the king's quarters? Such detail ont he roofs. Super beautiful. Seeing the Blue House at the end was a bonus we weren't expecting. It was nice to see the Hanok Village right next door as well.
A nice palace!,Please check the Opening dates before your visit. I have noticed that some Palace are closed on Mondays while other are closed on Tuesdays. Please check! I did it with the Red Bus Tour!
Beautifully History ,"The history and culture is rich! I highly recommend a visit here, pack a lunch and make it a picnic! This is a place to enjoy, and take in! I couldn’t spend enough time here if I tried! Also take advantage of the free speaking tours! "
Historic palace grounds,"Enter these walls and you'll find yourself lost in a labyrinth of pathways and structures. And although the expansive grounds seem to extend infinitely toward the mountains as you press deeper and deeper, what remains today is most but not all of the once massive palace grounds that existed in the 15th century (as illustrated by a mural in the palace museum).Built in 1395, this was the Joseon dynasty's most extensive endeavor, an enormous facility on 107 acres with 7,700 rooms (99 acres remain now). This is a stunning relic of the past, a maze of buildings, every turn providing new adventures. I highly recommend this site if you're visiting Seoul."
The sum of all palaces,This palace is the greatest palace of all palaces in Seoul in my opinion. Both in size as in attractiveness. Beautiful buildings and landscape. If you want to visit only one palace this is the one.
Traveling back to the past,I recommend you visiting this with a hanbok rental. Most people go here for photos and this place never disappoints. 
Gyeongbokgung Palace,I’ve loved the experience of wearing a traditional Korean cloth (Hanbok) and walking in the palace. The admission to Gyeongbokgung Palace was free since we were wearing Hanbok. I do encourage people who wants to experience Korean culture to visit the palace. The rental shops are near by the Palace where they offer for men’s and Women’s Korean clothes. There are few coffee shops and gift shops inside. Beside you will be able to see presidential blue palace. 
Good palace,"The area of the palace very large. We were there for 2 hour but not explore all. Enter the palace must pay, but if you wear hanbok (korea traditional clothes) you can enter free). We rental hanbok at LOK GALLERY (picture number 2) the owner very2 patient(you can see from the first picture- wearing black), but my kids rental at different place but the owner was rude(last picture). The first time we go to their place becauce it is in front of the main stret, but after now the owner like that, me, mum and husband looking another place and found LOK GALLERY(from the the gallery i book for my kids just walk forward you can find the LOK GALLERY, located in small stret. At certain time there is performance at a field before enter the palace (at that time i saw at 2 pm), so if you don’t want pay, you can still see the performance. If you want to see the garden and small lake (the view here was good)after enter you can go to left side. Must visit palace if you go to korea."
An impressive place,"Many royal palaces, some unfortunately under re-construction. Good to stroll around even wihout a guide."
Gyeongbokgung Palace,It gives you a sense of traveling back in time. Gyeongbokgung palace is a great place to visit with your family and friends. You can even try on their traditional Hanbok ( traditional Korean outfit ) if you want to feel and look authentic. Took a tour around the whole palace and the view was utterly breathtaking. One of the best palace I've ever been too. 9/10
Changing of the Guard Ceremony,"Watching the Changing of the Guard Ceremony was free but to get into the rest of Gyeongbokgung Palace cost 3000Won. It was sunny and hot with no shade to watch the Ceremony at 10 am. I highly recommend wearing a hat, sunglasses, and sunscreen. Some people were using umbrellas. There are free pamphlets about the Changing of the Guard Ceremony and about Gyeongbokgung Palace near the main entrance of Gwanghwamun Gate.The layout of the palace complex reminded me of Beijing’s Forbidden City. Gyeongbokgung Palace is the largest of the four main palaces. There are free guided tours in English. Just wait by the sign just past the ticket entrance at Heungnyemun Gate. I joined the one that started at 11 am. The tour lasted about an hour and the guide was very good and spoke very good English. You’re free to wander around after the tour.I combined the visit to the Palace with visits to the nearby National Folk Museum of Korea and National Palace Museum of Korea. The National Folk Museum of Korea is right in the Palace ground and the National Palace Museum of Korea is next the exit 5 of the Gyeongbokgung Station for the L3 subway line."
A Must See For Korean Royalty Culture,"GyeongBokGung is absolutely stunning and beautiful! History is alive here and everything has been preserved so well. I'm so happy to see such thriving history and stunning culture of what royal life must have been like to come alive right before my eyes. Everything as soon as you enter the gate, to the changing of the guards, the buildings, and throne room -- ALL is stunning. You don't want to miss this!NOTE: I believe this palace is open everyday for tourism and it's super cheap! I only paid like $2 or $3 dollars and my teenage sister was half price. So this is definitely a lengthy and cheap tour for the whole family! Enjoy!"
Stunning,Just when you think you've seen all the grounds...there's more. Great place to visit in any season !!
Amazing experience,"My husband and I wanted to go back to Hong Kong (our hometown) celebrated his birthday. We stayed in Seoul for 5 days and then to Hong Kong for 5 days.Seoul was very nice and clean, younger Korean speak English. We didn’t have enough time to visit all palaces, I picked Gyeongbokgung Palace to see the changing of the Royal Guards. It was amazing! Seoul is easy to get around with great rail system. We would go again to the Gyeongbokgung Palace again when next time we visit in Seoul again."
Best Cultural Place,"If you like about the culture of Korea, you should go here for enjoying the culture of it. In this place also a time for the changing of the guard of the palace, a museum about the Korean culture, and the building are still in a very good condition. If you use Hanbok (Korean traditional clothes) you don't have to pay for the entrance fee which is 3,000 won or around 2.7 USD"
Beautiful palace!,I had a great time at the palace. It was pretty much what I expected when I arrived. I loved the contrast between the old architecture and the new buildings in the background. Worth the small fee! And make sure you catch the changing of the guards. 
"Amazing Palace, A must visit","If in Seoul, you have to visit this place. Make sure to check opening hours and days that are closed. Sometimes, there are events and the palace can be closed. Take comfortable shoes, since you will be walking a lot. Make sure to take a hat and water with you as well. It will take at least 2 or 3 hours to check out most of the spots. You will be able to take some lovely photos of the palace and the beautiful settings there. It must have been so quiet and peaceful back then. I have made it to 155 countries. I have an extensive blog at pinchetravels.com, if you want to read more about my travels. "
Recommend!,"The palace is so much humorous. One the best place to take a picture, you can rent Hanbok dress at the store behind the palace and get free entrance the palace so you don’t have to buy a ticket at front of this place. "
"Second best palace, but right in the middle of the city, beautiful to walk around","In terms of size and magnificence it's the second best of the 4 palaces in my opinion. However, this one gets the most tourist because it's right in the middle of the city with a big statue in front of it. It's the palace of one of the wisest king in Korea who also invented the modern Korean writing script in an attempt to replace the Chinese script.Inside it's beautiful with many places to walk around and enjoy a nice day in the park. The palaces and buildings, like all other 4 palaces, could be that much better enhanced if they actually placed ancient artifacts/furniture in there instead of a big empty room. Most of them are locked up..."
Cool sight ,This was super interesting to see. The tickets are only $3 to go inside and walk around. The grounds are expanse which is crazy because it sits in the middle of Seoul. There were guards dressed up along with several of the visitors. Men and women wearing transitional outfits. Unsure if this is the norm or we were there on a special day. It’s mostly outdoors so prepare for rain or shine. The walking is easy. A section of the pond was closed for reconstruction. Definitely worth seeing if in Seoul. 
A must visit Palace in Korea,"You are not ""visiting"" korea if haven't visit this palace! very unique and beautiful buildings! You even can rent hanbok, a korean traditional cloths and going around this huge palaces!"
Seoul vacation,"We learned a lot of the history of Korea when we visited the palace. Despite the place being packed and the rain, we had a great time. This is definitely one of the must see places in Seoul. "
Great Palace,"Plan a whole morning to visit this palace. Its bigger than i imagined. Start by watching the Guard Exchange. Buy the Combo ticket, that includes 5 total Palaces/Temples around Seoul."
History in the city centre,"Gyeongbokgung Palace is really nice place and must see place in Seoul, it is located in the right city centre just next to skyscrapers.this place is not just aboutGyeongbokgung Palace itself, there're many other smaller buildings, streets and secluded places. To visit this place in the morning seems to be better to avoid crowds."
Main historical place,Seoul has been destroyed by invasions and catastrophes several times so you have to have in mind that most part of the monuments have been heavily restored. Having this is mind is a beautiful place to understand Korean culture
Awesome!!,It's a nice place for a historic site visit. I was with my friends and they gave me a real good and well rounded tour along with a nice dinner place recommendation right next to the palace.
Nice historical palace,Good place to revisit Korean history. Otherwise the place doesn't really have much of other stuff to do.Imperial soldiers will parade the ground every few hours. Great photo-taking opportunity. Otherwise 1 to 2 hours here should be sufficient.
Breathtaking ,What a privilege to tour Gyeongbokgung Palace. You see many women and men visiting wearing traditional garments to compliment the scene. I arrived right in time to whiteness changing of the guards. This was my first time to South Korea so especially for first time visitors I’d highly recommend. 
Great cultural experience,"The main palace in Seoul, located in a straight line with the statue of Admiral Yi Soon Shin, the Great King Sejong, and the Gwanghwamun Gate.You can enter for free when you wear hanbok (Korean traditional costume) which you can rent from places across the palace for around KRW 7,500 to 10,000 for 2 hours, or you can pay KRW 3,000 to enter. The palace is very spacious. At the end there is the throne room which you can see only from outside.Beside the palace, there is an adjacent garden and smaller living quarters. Great for taking pictures and to just absorb the places whete the royal once lived.During certain time, there is a changing guards activities at the main Gwanghwamun Gate."
"History, buildings and a nice walk",Cater 4 hours for a stroll through the palace. I strongly suggest to engage a local guide to inform your group. There are local guides who volunteer without charge. The stories could have come from a K drama.
Beautiful historical palace,"Really beautiful palace grounds. Lots of interesting areas, with different views. There’s an area for traditional performances. And a crafts shop. Throne room in view and 7 story pagoda. "
Nice palace with great history,Very nice palace. Think Forbidden City but on a smaller scale. Great recreation of changing of the guard.
Great day out,"If you're in Seoul, you really need to visit this place. Amazing, also has a good museum inside which is worth a look. "
Very impressive,A totally unexpected bonus was that when exiting the station there were a group of high school volunteers who offered to take you around absolutely free. They were a part of a programme and professionally presented so we used them. Our guide was Daniel Shin who was extremely knowledgeable spoke excellent English and adapted to our curiosity and interests. For one so young he was excellent in painting a story of the palace over the ages. We would have been worse off without him and the programmme for youngsters they run. 
First must see place in Seoul,"This is where your visit through Seoul must start: the Great Palace!Spectacular, magnificent, a reminder of the culture once Koreans shared with Chinese. Located among New Seoul, this Palace reminds u of the dynasties in this place. You can perfectly picture the outside fortress or wall, the inside chambers for the people close to the emperor, the emperor’s palace, the opulence of his room, the gardens, exits, streets and hallways. Take as many pics as you can, every little space is awesome!Get there by metro, the Station has the same name as the palace, within walking distance you can also find downtown and many local restaurants."
The most popular Palace in Seoul,"Most the group tour this is number one attraction to visit, we came on hop-on hop-offSeoul city tour bus A is Downtown and Palace course, we got on at Myeongdong, it took about 35 minutes to get here, along the way, we pass many attractions which we already visited, still fun the see all part of the city, this is a very big Palace with many buildings, many tourist young and old dress in the traditional costume, taking pictures with their cell phone, good memory photos to bring home to show friends, it's a huge area, easily take couple hour or more, you can see the change of guard on schedule 10 am and 2 pm."
Must visit when in Seoul,The first palace built in the Joseon dynasty - very majestic and impressive. Went on a guided tour of the palace 2 years ago and this time we stumbled upon a late opening in the evening. Entrance was only 3000 won and there were 500 tickets reserved for foreigners. There were many people in hanbok and performances on a stage so it was a great atmosphere. The palace looked stunning lit up. A must-visit in Seoul!
Beautiful place...,"This place is huge and a lot of walking. There was a ceremony for about 10 mins and it was nice. I don’t know how much would it cost for the entrance, since our tour guide got it for us. A lot of people, but since the place so big that people were at diff places. Overall, great place to visit if you’re in Seoul."
Ancient palace,"Lots of great photo ops, but lots of people even though we were there on a weekday. You should note that you can get in for free if you wear a traditional hanbok, which is very fun to do. I believe that there is supposed to be a free English language tour, but we didn't find it. It might have been more interesting if we did"
Absolutely beautiful ,The vastness of the palatial palace can't be captured with a picture. It is absolutely splendid. I suggest you do the hanbok rental. Also use the metro to travel to the palace as it takes you to the doorstep of the palace and its the cheapest method and best method of transportation. A must see!! 
Wonderful palace,With rented hanbok we enjoyed the palace and it was really a wonderful experience! Definately must see!
Must see in Seoul,"There are 4 more palaces in the city but this is the one to visit if you need to pick one. ¥3000 entrance fee for an adult. Beautiful palace grounds. Free guided tours. If you rent a traditional costume palace waive the entrance fee. Although I don’t feel it (cultural appropriation) is right thing to do, yet it looks great on the majestic palace grounds. There is a near by museum with historic artifacts and detailed facts about Korean history. A must see!!!"
Day trip,Well worth a visit. Think of the Forbidden City in Beijing. The Palace is just as amazing to see. It’s a large place with lovely grounds to walk and enjoy and impressive buildings. 
Amazing work of Art,Get to know the history of Korea by visiting one of this majestic palace. The architect and colors are out of this world. Try to experience yourself the fine details of the palace.
Georgeus old palace,"It is really worth od seeing. If your love old asian architecture, you will love this old palace. They have free english guide every 2 hours I think. So you will have better experience from this place. "
"Beautiful, easy half day trip ","This place is pretty big! Very pretty and picturesque, lots of areas to walk around and enjoy. People wearing traditional clothing, snack shop with coffee etc available (pricey though!) we spent 3 hours here in total and enjoyed it."
Great historical place to visit in Seoul!,Very elaborate architectural design from the past. The Gyeongbokgung palace is a must for every traveler! Really inexpensive to get in and plenty of beautiful things to witness inside the palace premises.
Gigantic,"I had a two hour visit to the Gyeongbok palace with a tour guide miss Sue Chung, a government certified English tour guide. The palace is gigantic in location with many chambers such as working and residential. The Gyeongbokgung Palace, which once had more than 7,000 rooms. The palace was restored in 1867. The palace is truly worth it. By the way, you will surely need to take a bottle of water, sunglasses and a hat with you. We rented traditional Korean attire for photos and roaming around the palace. The shopkeeper was the one who selected our attire with bright colors. SEE photos."
Don't miss the changing of the guard.,"Beautiful site, huge area. We spent over 6 hours there and could have spent another 6 looking around. The changing of the guard takes place at 10:00 am and 2:00 pm - definitely worth seeing. The grounds are gorgeous, peaceful.You forget about the bustling city outside the gates and lose yourself in centuries of history. The buildings are intriguing, the detail impressive. The mountains surrounding the palace are a majestic backdrop for the views and photos.The museum included in the price of entry spans two floors with an excellent collection of artifacts and glimpses of what life would have been like over the centuries. We only had an hour at the museum which was okay for a quick look. Next time I'll allow minimum 2 - 3 hours. Well worth seeing! "
Old Korea in the middle of the modern city,This palace is on a large piece of property with lovely old architecture and statues with the mountains behind on one side and the city on the other. Try to go at 10am or 2pm when they do the changing of the guard at the entry gates.
Wonderful and lovely place to leant more about Korean Heritage ,Amazing place to get involved into old days of Korean culture.You can find several place to take and become a nice photographer.Just a peaceful place. Highly recommended 
Amazing palace,Try to make the free performances of the guards. We saw all 3 performances. The palace is huge so wear comfortable walking shoes and pack water. It's difficult to decide whether this palace or Changdeokgung is better. Each has its unique charm. Took us about 4 hours to see all the shows and tour the palace. 
Main palace in seoul,The palace is a nice place to visit and learn of the countries history. the compound is made up of a number of building all having its own use and part in the kingdom.. give at least a few hours to roam and enjoy the area. check the changing of the guards schedule. there is free guided tours by students on the weekends you can find them in the subway going to the palace.. very knowledgeable kids doing the tour.. you wont regret
Beautiful Palace lovely Building and history ,"I loved this Palace. I enjoyed it a lot even tho it was raining hard when I went to visit in May.Some of the pictures have some sun light and many have rain drops.I’m a single 25 world travelerThe admission for the palace was very affordable 300 Won about 2.70 USD.I went by myself and I enjoyed walking around and seeing history and Korean style of Agriculture.I travel a lot and I enjoy seeing history and different styles.I roamed around the palace for hours and hours lots to see and capture. I sometimes imagine myself in the times when the palace was created and how great there building methods were to be able to still be shown today.If you are by yourself like me or in a huge group it will be perfect for EVERYONE I also enjoyed visiting the store in the Gyeongbokgung Palace.I love buying homemade Souvenirs, prices were reasonable.If you want to get the beautiful jewelry or crafted big items they are expensive.Make sure to ask for Tax Free if you are American or a Foreigner.Hope you enjoyed my pictures and a MUST see if you are in Seoul, South Korea "
Visit it at night for a different experience!,"We visited the palace in the evening - and loved the serene lightup of the palace. there was also a live performance of traditional drum dance and songs. only thing is, there weren't guided tours - we were pretty much on our own relying on the guide brochure. it was a breezy evening and really loved the serenity of the palace in the evening.after that, we took a short walk to Tosokchon Samgyetang restaurant to enjoy traditional korean ginseng chicken soup! Perfect end to the evening."
#SeoulMates,Good place. You can feel the cultural vibe is well preserved. Since view for the some photo snap. You can feel the vibe of being back in the past. 
Must see in Seoul,A beautiful peaceful place in the center of the city. I recommend buying the integrated palace ticket as it offers great saving
An awesome encounter with history!,"This was a great attraction, and I spent several productive hours here. THe Chosun Dynasty relics were particularly interesting. The ticket prices seemed reasonable and so many of the buildings and annexes were intensely photogenic."
Great Piece Of Korean History,Visited the palace while in S. Korea (Seoul) for my sons wedding. This was a great stop and great lesson in S. Korea’s history.
Single ticket or bundle,"When enter the palace you must buy a ticket except you wear a hanbok. There're single ticket ( ₩3000) or combination ticket for 4 palaces and Jongmyo Shrine (₩10.000). If you aren't sure, buy a single ticket. Gyeongbokgung itself very beautiful. Very clean."
History class to attend,"Great place to know the history of Korea in a day !. Took a metro train to Gyeongbokgung Station exit 5. After a short stroll, we were lucky to bump into a group of teenagers wearing the same orange coloured T shirts, apparently attached to certain organisation, lined up to be noticed and approached. We were asked whether of foreigners and one 14 yo girl, Veronica offered a guided tour for FREE. Yes, for free. Sure, we took it up right away.We were recommended to visit Gyeongbokgung Palace for various reasons. She took us to every corner of the palace that lasted 2 hours with detailed Korean history in fluent English.Inside you can attend and learn Korean palace tea technique and ceremony. Not far from tea site, a restaurant serving ancient palace meal as well. At 3:30 pm, we were lucky to enjoy Korean classical music with fantastic backdrop as shown in pic.Unfortunately we missed to rent/wear the Korean ancient costumes (only around the palace). Do remember the renting place is right inside the main gate. First come first serve basis. Apart from the palace , there are a few great museums within a short walking distance to explore all about the history of Korea."
Gyeongbokgung Palace ,"Large Palace complex adjacent to government precinct. Beautifully rebuilt and very well maintained. Can self-navigate, and different language brochures available including English. Check tines for opening and changing of guard (a colourful highlight). Plan for 1.5 to 2 hours."
Must visit place,"i am interested in historical place, if you do then you need to go here. They have a hanbok rental around the palace, so you can really walk around using hanbok like you are in joseon dynasty.The place it self is interesting."
Nice historic palace,It's a lovely place for selfie lovers. Especially when you dressed up in Hanbok and experience your time in the palace.
Gyeonbokgung Palace,This is one of the palaces at this location. You may spend couple of hours going through the whole location. Lots of locals with their hanboks (traditional Korean dress) visit this location to take pictures. You have to pay like 7 won per person to get in. You will be able to see several beautiful palaces.
Majestic,Would have wanted to experience during the different seasons but being there in summer was already breathtaking.
Good.,We visited all the four palaces & a shrine with the integrated ticket system(for more details check their official website). As far as my personal opinion i didnt enjoy much. My thoughts and expectation where to view the lifestyle of the Korean kings and Queens. In order to experience that we need to see the things they used the same replica of things atleast....but all we saw were just long or small plain halls with not much furnitures or things used by the kings and queens. Most of the halls or rooms were locked and not open for public. This palace was the biggest in area with many halls and grounds. As far as we saw people were just wandering about here and there just like us. May be if we had chosen the guided tour we would have known which place served for which purpose...but then too we dont get to see and imagine ourselves how lives would have been for the Royal family! Its my personal opinion...i dont mean to put down the spirits of visitors who are eager to visit soon or tourists who just get satisfied to set foot into the Royal ground. All 4 palaces were the same.
Interesting and rich cultural place,We joined the English free guided tour for the palace and gained many interesting insights to the palace that we wouldn't have known otherwise! 
Good stroll and scenic photo taking site,Great landmark tells on the Korean history and king Queen Palace. Good for hannok photography. Will visit again 
Beautiful,"beautiful place. learned a lot about the history of Korea. Also they offer free guided tours which was really cool! Our guide was a high school senior who graduates soon (Riley), she was very aware and informative about the history of Korea and the Palace. Definitely worth the visit. Also if you dress up in traditional Korean clothing you get in for free."
A must-see in Seoul,Definitely get a guided tour because without it you don't get the historic perspective and greater appreciation of what you are seeing. Tip: Rent a traditional Korean custome called hanbok at any of the rental stores nearby; admission is free plus you get to take some memorable photos with the palace in the background.
Fun day of palace viewing ,It’s pretty relaxed not much to do but actually see the palace so it’s great for learning about the culture pretty sure there are some guided tours I actually just got a ticket and explored was fun and a little confusing there is a museum on site but they were closed when I was there all in all it’s a good place to get a walk about in and see and feel a little history at the same time also some really good photo spots for scrapbookers 
Impressive imperial castle,"Historical Korean castle. It's quite huge, authentic and kept in good conditions. Highly recommend for those interested in history."
Go for the guided tour pls,"Gyeongbokgung is conveniently located near it's same name metro station. Managed to catch the changing of guards before entering the compound (entrance fee is 3000won per adult).Within the compound, because we didn't go for the guided tour, most of the time we felt quite lost :(I would think a guided tour would add more content and insights, rather than just random walking and photo taking within the compound."
Pretty cool,A great place to go learn about Korean traditon and stuffs. Good operation for a touristic site.....
Korean historical experience,"I went here by korean metro, if you go here on weekend, there is a bunch of students who offer a free tour for the palace, the students explanation is a lot better since they are better in english that the tour guide inside. Make sure you wear a warm clothes if you visit in winter, the wind here was pretty strong."
"A ""typical"" imperial palace","This looks like almost very other imperial palace, with the entry gates and rings of buildings surrounding the central palace. What makes this one different are: (1) the changing of the guard, which is worth seeing/waiting for; and (2) the very many -- at least on the day I visited -- women and men in traditional dress. Lots of picture taking of each other, and it makes the scene much more colorful than at other imperial palaces."
First time trip,"Place is beautiful. Large. And only cost 3 or 4 dollars for entry and free if you wear traditional Hanbok clothing which can be purchased outside the temple for a few from between $15-$50 dollars for 2 hrs depending on the store and how detailed you want yourself to look (i.e make up, accessories, clothing choice from standard to premium etc) You can go with a tour guide who will fill you in on who stayed where and what each building was or you can go on your own as we did and discover the place yourself. definitely recommend it."
Hanbok experience,We went here with matching traditional Korean clothes.We got lucky that there were ceremonies that we get to see.My tip is to bring lots of water. You can also buy inside. Not advisable to bring toddlers in strollers. No entrance fee.
Guards rotation,"Also one of the more beautiful palaces of Seoul but besides walking around for a good couple of hours inside these grounds, the rotation of the guards performance was the highlight. Don't remember how often it happens but be on the outside of the entrance when it does. It takes place at the entrance near Gwanghwuman. "
Rent the traditional costume for a more complete experience,"If you rent the traditional costume (hanbok) for the nearby shop (just check with the staff at the entrance), you get to go into the palace for free. If not, entrance fee will have to be paid after the first courtyard. Palace is really big and you will get an idea of the various functions of the different buildings if you have a local guide with you. If not, just listen in to the various guides who are shouting commentaries. As for photo opportunities, there are heaps and it just multiplies if you come dressed in their traditional costumes which a lot of the visitors do anyway, so you will not be the odd one out. There is not much shade beyond the buildings so bring some headdress as it is quite hot from noon onwards. In summer anyway. "
Huge and Perfect for Photo-ops,"I was so shocked to find such immaculately preserved ancient history in the middle of such a bustling city! Loved seeing the other visitors in their transitional dress for the tours. The picturesque mountain in the background, ponds, trees, and temples are exactly what you’re looking for in a great photo-op."
Great place to visit,Closed on Tuesdays. Found out only after we got there so had to come back another day. Overall a great experience. We revisited on Wed and it happened to be their cultural day so it was free entry. Downside are the crowds on that day with lots of students visiting. But still a must visit place
So so place to visit,"Like other places in Mainland China, this Palace dont have many things to see. All buildings were similar with chinese deco and tipical. almost half of the palace filled with sand field. No ete catching gardens that make our visit impressed. Only visitors with traditional hanbok dress could attract your eyes."
Beautiful (and Huge) Palace Complex,"The Gyeongbokgung Palace is one of the most fascinating things to do in Seoul. Plan to spend at least 2 1/2 hours there, perhaps more if it particularly interests you. The site is huge and includes multiple buildings and gardens. Just next to the grounds are also the interesting Palace Museum and Korean Folk Museum, both worth a visit."
Amazing site to visit while in Seoul,A comfortable park located in the city downtown are of Seoul. We enjoyed walking through and learning the history behind this site.
Interesting sight,"We took a free guided tour as it was offered at certain times, Interesting sights and very good with a guide that gives you information about the traditions and history of the place."
A Palace,"When you come up to the castle you will see places rent teen out traditional Korean clothing. I later discovered that you can get in the palace for free if you are wearing an outfit. If I remember correctly it was 3000 to get in or 10,000 for admittance to three palaces and One additional attraction. At certain times of the day they have a changing of the guard ceremony which is fun to watch."
Pretty cool place,I would go on a weekend so you can see everyone wearing beautiful traditional clothing. There isn't much to do when you get there but its nice to walk around just take a few hours to yourself.
Guard changing at 10am and 2pm,"Get there at 10am or 2pm for guard changing ceremony. Adds value to your visit. After the changing ceremony, you may take fotos with the guards at the gate. The palace is a place to visit to learn more about joesan dynasty. I had an interesting time there with a local guide. Best to read up before you go so that u can appreciate the culture and palace more. "
Well the visit and charge your camera ,Rented the traditional Korean dresses (hanbok) with a Korean friend at a shop close the palace. We took a lot of photos at the palace and had a lot of fun. Highly recommend it if you want to feel like a princess and travel back in time. I would recommend good and comfortable footwear as the palace is quite big and it took us a couple of hours (plus photo time) to finish. 
A bit confusing but nice,My only real complaint is that there really aren't enough English explanations.I enjoyed walking around but a lot of the time you have no clue what you are looking at.That said its easily accessible well maintained and very affordable.
A huge palace,I decided to visit with my friend. Entrance is very inexpensive and you get to see a huge palace. I must have walked over 7miles. From hotel to palace and backagain.There is a little cool feature that you could enjoy. In the middle street there is a huge statue of one of the smarter kings. You will see a little hut so check it out. The lend some period costumes for free and a spot where you can take a nice picture.
Interesting place,"It's an interesting place. Wear a hanbok and you can get in for free! It's a very big place so make sure to wear comfortable footwear. They have free flyers where you can read about each structure. And I think they offer FREE walking tours (but it's only at designated times). We weren't able to catch the changing of the guard ceremony so i have no comment on that. The palace grounds is huge and after a while, the buildings all seem to look the same. "
My favorite place so far,"Oh this was my favorite, i will come back for sure. We rented a hanbok for 10000won(10$) for two hours but we just finished for just 1hour so it is truly worth it and we only rented not the premium ones as we were trying to save money for other stuffs. I think there is an entrance fee but if you wearing a hanbok it is free. The palace is really a huge place. We dont know which way to go left or right but i think some of them are typical. I am looking for the lake it was on the left aide. I’ve watched a lot of historical dramas so it was like i’ve seen it before and for me as akdrama addict it felt so magical. It was like living from ancient times. It was summer so remember to put sunblock and get ready to sweat from wearing hanbok hehehe. Oh by the way the other lake was close but you can view it only in small windows from the fence."
Beautiful Palace,"It was really hot in early Jun so please put on sunblock for your little ones. The palace is a good place to visit if you wish to understand the korean culture and history. Be sure to catch the parade at the palace square. Please find out when the s A visit to the museum first (opposite the ticketing booth) will be most useful because it allows us to appreciate the place better. In comparison, this palace may not be as grand as the forbidden city."
Majestic palace ...,Largest and most famous palace in South Korea. Identical to Forbidden city in China. Beautiful Korean architecture. Many locals comes there wearing traditional costumes called Hanbok. Not only for locals anyone can hire these outfits and entry will be free of charge. We were there on time to watch royal guard ceremony in their traditional uniforms carrying flags & weapons. Unique on it own way.Beautiful garden with cherry blossoms in season. Must stop at Hyangwanji pond to see the grand pavilion. Palace closes at 6 pm. Wear comfy shoes .Great place to see their culture and traditions.
Don't forget your Hanbok,"Time travel is true to this well preserved palace. Despite being in the middle of busy CBD, the times goes back a couple of century when you're inside the gates. To complete your experience, Hanbok rentals are available outside the palace for KRW 5,000-KRW10,000. And yes, the KRW5,000 ones are good set but the shops are located at quite a distance from the palace entrance. ^,^. English speaking tour guides are also available for free. Their stories will make you appreciate the palace more. Just check their schedules near the entrance. If you're a morning person, you can check for changing guards ceremony ^,^. It's really a must see!"
Awesome Korean Cultural Field Trip,"If you are looking at traveling back into the main city center of Korean Dynasties, you are looking for Gyeongnbokgung! Make sure to wear a traditional Korean Outfit for a discounted fare in certain circumstances! I highly recommend for travelers with families. Enjoy!"
Great place to take hanbok pictures,"I recommend this place for hanbok picture taking. There are a lot of people dressed in traditional Korean clothes which adds to the feel of the whole experience. We stayed here for almost two hours, just taking pictures."
An icon in Seoul. One visit would do.,A must to visit. Very big place so we did not cover the whole area. Spent about 1.5 hours inside... There’s a small fee to enter the palace and it’s crowded everywhere.. You may want to find out the timing for changing of guards. Nothing interesting but we so happen to be there when it happened. 
Palace visit,This is a Wonderful experience that everyone should see when visiting Seoul. Many locals were dressed up in traditional Korean attire. The walk thru this place is very fascinating. The architecture is really a true work of art. The museum in the grounds was also a very memorable place to see.
Busy but some lovely buildings,"This is a great tourist attraction. They make no bones that the palace is not an original and was rebuilt in 1868 after being ruined for 300 years. At 10AM they have a tourist spectacle when they do a changing of the guard ceremony which is very colourful. That takes place in the first courtyard, which is a huge enclosure. From here you proceed to various staterooms, sleeping quarters and then a small garden. The restoration has been nicely done so you can get a feel of how the place used to be. The chimneys are interesting, being outside of the buildings and I think there is one original fireplace and chimney from the 1360's. It was a shame that when we were there the gardens behind the main palace that had a pavillion in the middle of a lake of waterlillies, was actually closed. Admission was 3000 won and there are plenty of bus stops right by the front gate."
Super beautiful with evening lights,"We went to visit the palace just before sunset and it was really stunning to see the palace in the evening light and later on with the lights on. We were extremely lucky to hear and see performances of traditional singing and music that evening. Wonderful palace, really worth a visit when you are in Seoul."
Great piece of history,bring a hat or umbrella but its great. with enough facilities for whatever you need. there is even an MRT entrance within the palace ground
Impressive complex,We visited all five of the big palaces in the city and found Gyeongbokgung together with Changdeokgung to be the most impressive ones. While you can't really enter any of the buildings it's worth a visit for the impressive view on the gate alone.
"Great place, wear a hanbok for free entry!","One of the biggest palaces in central Seoul and I'm impressed by how well-kept the place is. It feels like you can step back in time and feel what it was like a few hundred years ago. Something you might not know is that you can rent a hanbok (Korean traditional dress) from the nearby areas and enter the palace(s) for free. I got mine from Hanboknam but there are a ton all around the palace. Might as well get it and feel like a part of the era. Little things like the changing of guard ceremony also help in helping visitors appreciated what it was like in the past.I would have appreciated if there were picture signage to help me identify where I was within the palace. That said it would have broke into the whole authenticity of the space. Overall it's a beautiful timepiece symbolic of an older Korea. Worth 1-2 hours of just visiting and wandering around, more if you're wearing a hanbok and taking pictures."
Really nice but so big! ,This palace is really nice to see even knowing that it's all reconstructed. The this is that you need to take your time to go around because it takes at least 2-3 hours to go around and see everything. The library at the end is also very nice. 
Reconstruction done well,"Since the japanese destroyed all,it was rebuild.Notting much left inside but fancy woodwork.frankly i wasnt impressed much!If you skip it you wont miss much"
Jus t amazing!,I think that if you are out of Asia you will be very impressed once you visit any palace in Seoul. You need to visit them.
It’s beautiful ,It’s beautiful lovely place so many thing to see and amazing garden and you can see a blue house where is the Korean President live !! Very clean good place to visit and relax !! You can shop and have coffee shop too !! You can walk or take MRT or bus if you stay in the center of city ! I do love Seoul very much will come back next week June 5 
Beautiful palace!,"With just 3000 entry fee, this place was worth the visit. It is huge and I would recommend visiting during 4 in the evening when the sun is not harsh and it closed by 6 PM, so 2 hours would be a good time here. I recently heard about the night tour, if they have it - go for it.Gardens, palaces and museums - a long walk but a good experience."
A must to visit,"Gorgeous, history filled and truly a spectacle. Be there by 10am to witness the ceremony of guard change, 11am if you want the free tour guide (which is highly recommended because you really feel attached to the place).."
A must to visit in Seoul,"The view around the palace is so awesome, many tourists are wearing Hanbok, the place is a bit touristy, recommended to visit when you are in Seoul."
A must visit place in Seoul ,The palace and the surrounding are well maintained and beautiful. It’s free entry if you wear the traditional Korean dress or hanbok. There are many rental shops nearby. It is also a fun experience to wear the traditional dress walking around the palace.
Very hot place,Didn't enter because it's too hot. End up visit the national museum nearby which is great to visit as well.
Important to visit once,"If you haven't seen korean tradional buildings (palaces, temples etc), you should go here to appreciate the style. They also have a change of guard ceremony in traditional clothes. Once you have seen it, be aware that every other traditional building in korea has near identical shapes, colors etc. "
The royal palace,A must to visit this place when you are in SeoelThis Ares is completely renovatie and give you A good idea of the past. The buildings and the area inside are wonderpil. Surely you wil make beautifull pictures
"A nice place, must visit","It was a wonderful experience visiting this place. We went to Anguk station to rent a hanbok before going to Gyeongbukgung. This palace is huge and beautiful, great places for picture. Free entrance should you dress in hanbok, must visit at least once."
a must-visit place in seoul,"the view is simply stunning. i went there in nov and there r red leaves. amazing. if u r lucky enough, visit the secret garden as well. we cant get the tix though as they r sold out - we wanted the guided tour, and that needs online registration which has quota. i guess the pics i took simply couldnt capture the beauty. go there yourself to find it out"
A must visit for everyone,"So beautiful and large with many small old buildings inside. The architecture is so wonderful and unique. I had a great experience with Hanbok - a Korean traditional dress there. You should try to rent one (they have all clothings for men, women and children also with many styles and colors) and take some pictures with this place. In addition, you can go inside for free if you wear Korean traditonal clothings, so cool! "
Traditional,"Good place. Must visit. Know about a lot of history, the rulers etc. It shows about their dynasty, about the king etc."
Great for pictures but not much to see,"It was fun wearing Hanbok, Korean traditional outfit, and walking around the palace. Plenty of rental shops around. Free entrance if you are wearing Hanbok! However, there isn’t much to see but great for pictures!"
The palace is really pretty but crowded,"I rented a hanbok and visit Gyeongbukgung, if you do that you can get in for free! However eventhough it was mid-week, it was very crowded and it was hard to enjoy the scene fully. But I definitely enjoyed it! "
korean heart,Not expensive (almost 3 USD) and you will enjoy it a lot! Also you can join a free tour guide (English) and learn everything about the palace and the king.After the tour you can stay there admiring all the palace and it is near of other sightseen sites.
"Dress up, and admission is free!!","I visited Gyeongbokgung Palace with my family. Although I was not dressed up, I realized that many people were dressed up in traditional Korean dresses and outfits. Their clothing really adds to the overall traditional aspect of the temple. If you chose to rent traditional Korean clothing, you do not have to pay admission into the temple. Otherwise, you pay admission to enter. There are many temples inside, along with a lake and sometimes music performances. (Folk music). Would definitely recommend if you are interested in either experiencing traditional Korean clothing, or watching others do so!! "
Gyeongbokgung Palace,"Main palace of the Joseon Dynasty and built in the 14th Century. The palace grounds are vast and the national museum for palaces is situated in its grounds near Heungnyemun Gate (main gate). The entrance fee is quite cheap only 3000 won or free if you arrive wearing traditional Korean clothing such as a Hanbok. This activity is definitely something you should do when it is a dry day and it is near other sites like Samcheong park, Changgyeonggung palace and Deoksugung park. Plenty of other places, street food, restaurants in and around the area so you can make a big day of it. We made a big day of it visiting both palaces, once in traditional hanbok and once not and we got some great food including Gyeranbbang (egg bread) and chicken ginseng and looking around the local shops and markets."
A must visit attraction in Seoul,"This is really one of the must visit attraction for any visit to Seoul. It's nicely preserved and clean, expect during our visit, there is some area under renovation and closed off."
The Power of and Ancient Nation,"To visit a country so proud of its cultural heritage is pleasant. So much time has been taken to not only rebuild a nation so recently devastated by war, but to rebuild a historical journey of a country that has been in the middle of conflict since ancient times. Gyeongbokgung was the primary Palace and stronghold of the King and when you see it you will understand why. The skill to build such a place without the technology of today is breathe taking. Don't just look at the walls and the buildings, take the time to look at how they were constructed and how they fit in with the other palaces, shrines and protective walls that were built to repel invasions. When you sit and take in the sheer expanse of these sites and the amount of people it took to make them run it is mind blowing. To see early ducted underground heating in these ancient sites is stunning. Sit in the gardens, take photos and enjoy everything the site has to offer. "
Hanboks made for great photo opportunities,It is easy to get off at one subway stop and travel to many sites on foot through a day in this area. The palace was made even more beautiful with Koreans dressed up in hanboks that you can rent from local shops. Pictures were very fun!
A must visit attraction,"As everybody says in the review, you can't leave Seoul without visiting this place. It is always busy everyday throughout the year, but it'll worth it. I visited during a weekday, and there were lots of students ranged from elementary school to college, that were on their study tour. Some of them wears beautiful hanbok because admission is free if you wear hanbok. In fact, it's just like going to Disneyland without Mickey's ears, so be sure to rent one, there are lots of hanbok rentals around. Some of the students will ask you for a photo though, it's their assignment from the school. It's quite fun, but probably a little annoying if you don't like talking to strangers."
Must visit while in Seoul...,"Wonderfull Palace and a discovery of the Korean culture and traditions, it was really interesting and beautifull. Definitely you can spend some time here and enjoy the moment..."
Korean history in the midst of Seoul,"We only had two days in Seoul and this was one of the first places we headed to see. I am very glad we did - the palace was beautiful and its surrounding grounds large and stunning. You could easily spend a whole day just walking around and taking in the different areas, however I would recommend setting aside two hours for a good feel of the place. It is definitely worth paying the low fee of the entrance ticket to fully enjoy the grounds and not just the entrance area.What really adds to the historic feeling is the many beautiful dresses worn by Koreans. Shops in the area will rent out historic costumes and many Korean girls and couples can be seen taking photos within the palace grounds. It's a beautiful sight that's worth seeing. If you're daring, perhaps rent out a costume yourself for a nice photo-shoot? The grounds definitely have loads of opportunities for lovely pictures than cannot be taken anywhere else."
OK. ,It's just Palace which no longer original. But it's still worth spending time while in Seoul. And all the buildings look the same. 
Sublime!,"It was my place that I visited just after I arrivedAt least I discovered immediately the Korean culture and ambianceYou should see the Guards who wear traditional dress, the 3 mains courtyards are full with locals who rent traditional costumesBut the others part of the royal complexe are empty and full of serinityIt s like a city inside the cityAll was destroyed but the gouvernement decided to rebuild it as it was and they win the challengeIt s stunningIf you love take pictures be ready!"
Nice day out.,Lovely palace with lots of history to learn about. Try and catch the traditional Korean music concert that happens near the cafe/gift shop cause it was really good! 
Awesome Palace,This place is huge. Very nice architectures and houses. Great for picture taking in historical sceneries. We spent 5 hours here. 
Heritage in city center! Must go place,"A wonderful place with great history that showcases South Korea in the bygone days. It is neatly preserved and some parts are being reconstructed to ensure the touch of history is intact. The entry is 3000KW and you will have to walk through the many palaces, rooms and many sites around the complex. A wonderful place to enjoy Korean History and a must visit when in South Korea."
A must when in SoKor,I guess everyone who goes to SoKor gets to see this place. Those who love k-drama will definitely enjoy the visit. The area is huge and having a tour guide makes going around more convenient.
Change of guards viewing - No entrance tickets needed,"If you only have time to view the famous changing of guards, you do not need to purchase the admission fees to the palace. For those who rented traditional Korean costume and wish to take more pictures within the huge grounds of the palace, you will need to purchase entrance tickets. The changing of guards is an impressive ceremony and worth the wait."
A palace in the centre of the city,"An old palace that is right in the centre of the city that attracts lots of tourists and locals daily. Along the way to the palace, we spotted a lot of shops that rent out Hanboks to tourists and many tourists were in Hanboks walking towards the palace. My friend and I did not bother to rent as we find it a hassle to walk back to the shop to return. But we realised a reason for wearing a Hanbok to the palace as you get to enter for free! You can see almost the palace were filled with visitors wearing Hanboks. Only a handful (my friend and I) were in our plain clothes. It is a big palace with a museum built inside the palace. We had a good stroll looking around at the beautiful structure and many areas are still constructing/refurnishing. A good place to stroll and relax. We saw a lot of elderly walking around, sitting under the trees etc to enjoy the day. But there isn't much to be fascinated as I prefer nature scenery to buildings. But if you like buildings, you may want to spend a whole day walking around."
Changing of the Guard,"The changing of the Guard is very impressive!...With their traditional blue and red uniforms, colorful flags and traditional weapons, it kind of takes you momentarily back into the past. And the end you even get to take pictures with some of the guards, making the event more memorable and a part of the visit not to be missed.The architecture of Palace is beautiful. Within it's nice and well maintained garden, a there's an uncountable number of buildings, which in some places lead your eyes to a perfect fusion of pointy rooftops, and overhangs decorated in predominantly green colors, as well as interior ceilings decorated in perfect details.With many people visiting on a Saturday, it was sometimes a bit difficult to take pictures in the most popular spots, but Koreans are very nice and cooperative people, hence no problem.A lovely place to visit, an experience not to be missed!..."
Worth to visit,"It's must visit place if you are in Seoul. The Palace is beautiful, buildings are impressive. Better to take a guided tour to learn about history and culture. Every hour you can see changing guards ceremony. If you rent a Hanbok in nearby shop, you can take very authentic pics."
A must-see in Seoul,"It is a grand palace with impressive buildings and gardens. In certain times of the year one could visit it at night. For foreigners one could buy the ticket at a special ticket counter near the entrance. I have visited the palace several times, usually after visiting Changdeokgung Palace and Changgyeonggung Palace. From the front of the Changdeokgung Palace, I normally take a taxi for a small fare to go to Gyeongbokgung, as the road traffic goes in that direction ie without a big detour and it also saves a lot of trouble eg going there by metro."
Nice Palace,"It's a good experience to visit Gyeongbokgung Palace with our Hanbok wear. If you are wearing hanbok you can enter the palace for free. Our tour guide brought as around and the place is big and the view, flowers and everything is beautiful. A nice place to take pictures and understanding its history about the palace. A must visit place when you visit seoul."
Great morning,Spent the morning at the palace arrived at 1000 for the changing of the guards then free English tour for about one hour starting at 1100am
Impressive,Worth a visit when in Seoul. Enjoyed the grounds and changing of the guards ceremony. The entrance fee is very affordable and worth the cost. Must see. 
Excellent!,"With 3,000 won,its really worth it!so many beautiful spot to take picture.also u will learn a lot when u go to the museum inside the palace.recommend it!"
Wonderful blend of past and present,"My girlfriends and I visited the palace dressed in Hanbok, the traditional Korean dress, on a Sunday morning. The Hanbok rental place (3355 Hanbok rental) is conveniently located approx. 5 minutes walk away from the palace. The first thing we noticed when we arrived was the huge crowd outside of the visitors' entrance. The reason for this soon became clear- the changing of the guards' ceremony was taking place. This is when the palace guards (all dressed in their traditional guard attires) would 'change shifts' and it is a must see as the ceremony is quite elaborate and goes on for about 30 minutes or so.The next thing we noticed is the crowd in general. If you wear a Hanbok to visit the palace, entry will be free (please do confirm for yourself there as this might change). Thus, there were a lot of people, both foreign and local, dressed up in the Hanbok visiting the palace. And it was of course, a weekend. I'd advise you plan your visit for sometime during the week if possible.Insofar as the palace itself is concerned, it is well-preserved and definitely worth visiting as it is a piece of Korean history- both in terms of culture and architecture."
Palace Visit on a Traditional Korean Culture Day. ,This palace is to be visited when in Seoul and the best part of the day was seeing the people. When I went there was a festival of Korean Culture where people dressed up in traditional clothing and wandered the site. To be honest I’ve visited too many of these temples of late but it is impressive and if you can go at night (which I did not - I saw a friends pictures) it is more impressive. There are stores nearby that rent the traditional clothing so if you are interested you too can look like you fit in. 
History Magic! ,Love the palace and the vibe ! All girls and boys dressed up in Hanbok traditional clothes and as colorful and royal as it looks. 
Good enough ,"Bought a good deal from kkday for Php 899/person for a 6hr rental of hanbok. The location of the hanbok studio is strategical since it’s in front of the gate of this palace. Wearing traditional dress like hanbok will free yourself from paying entrances for most of the palaces. I believe Changdeokgung palace is the only palace that’s asking for an entrance fee even if you’re are wearing hanbok, as I’ve heard this is the most beautiful and instagrammable of all. We did not able to visit all palaces on the same day because of the limited time. We thought 6hrs is enough to explore those, but I was wrong, since palaces are far from each other. Gyeongbokgung is a huge palace and most of the time it’s crowded, but we did enjoy the sight seeings, go ahead and take a picture with the doors and walls, it’s instagrammable. The comfort is very far so I suggest you take one map from the tourist information, if you plan to wear hanbok, (Irecommend that for a full experience) I suggest you rent a 24hr and do it very early so that you can explore all the palaces. All the palace close at 6pm. But you can opt to rent for hours more cheaper then take a cab going to other palaces too. This the way going there: Take a subway going gyeongbokgung station and exit 3-1 there’s many hanbok rental on that exit. But if you don’t like wearing one just go straight up to the other side of entrance. Please download Seoul subway map. "
#1 Tourist site you should visit,"If you visit korea, this palace is a must to visit. This place is amazing and this palve is a site of korean saeguk drama shooting place.Dont forget to watch change guardian ceremony and wear ur hanbok so you could enter this place free (with no hanbok u must pay 3000won)"
Worth visiting ,"This palace is worth visiting if you are in Seoul. Will need to pay an entrance fee but the place is big enough for a couple of hours of touring. Do check out the timing for change of Guards ceremony, will be worth watching. Remember to check out the museum too, free admission for palace visitors."
Nice palace to visit,"Among the several palaces to visit in Seoul, we chose this one. It is quite big , with gardens and you meet lots of people going around in hired traditional costumes. Nice atmosphere"
Doesn’t really matter that most everything is a reconstruction,"Most all the Palace buildings were demolished during the Japanese occupation in the early 1900s and restored in the 1990s. The buildings are still stunning with mountains in the background to the north and west. When we were there, there were a great number of school children as well as about 10% of people walking around in hanboks, the traditional dress. There are free guided tours available. We were with a private tour."
Good for Photo-Taking with Hanbok,"One of the biggest palace in Seoul that we were recommended to visit. However after heading over, we realised there was not much to see. However, it proves as a good spot for photo-taking if in Hanbok as it matches the theme. Luckily for us, it wasn't overly crowded and photo-taking was a breeze. However depending on the locations of the hanbok rental shop, the journey to the palace may take up to 30min! "
Nice Place ,It offers a nice atmosphere to walk around and learn the history. Morning time to visit is better as we have to walk a lots 
Majestic at night ,This site is definitely worth waiting for in the evening. The lighting shows the fabulous colors of the facades and decorative woodwork. Enjoy the walk through the walled palace and gardens.
 Breathtaking,"One of the best places in Seoul. Rent a hanbok (traditional costume) and walk in the palace. There is a view to the river, and a park there. Enjoy also the guard change. "
Best with hanbok,Probably the most famous for palace visitors in Seoul. Wear hanbok for a free entrance to the grounds. Nice place for taking pictures.
A regular palace,We only went to this palace due to the limited time we had.Perhaps it's ignorance and lack of knowledge but it was one big building (palace i assume) in a huge enclosed area.The best part for us however was to dress in traditional hanboks and take pictures- again perhaps ignorance on my part to not being able to appreciate the history and significance of this. 
"Beautiful, serene","We lived in Seoul more than a decade ago and visited the palace then. It seems more beautiful than I remembered it. The palace is situated right in the city with mountains on the side. We saw many tourists wearing hanboks, the traditional Korean dress. Apparently, there were some rental places just right outside the palace. We went by metro and our exit led us straight to the palace so we missed the shops. My two daughters thought it would be nice to dress up and take photos on the Palace grounds. We spent about two hours here. "
Must See While in Seoul,This is the only tour we did guided in Seoul. The rest of the attractions we went to unguided. Korea has such a great history 6ou have to get the guided tour to bring everything together. Must see. 1000 there is a changing of the guard ceremony which I highly recommend. Great tour. 
Gyeongbokgung palace,"Is amazing in korea. Make me like korean girl, hanbok and the kingdom of republic korea. I love this vacation"
Go further inside to see the picturesque man-made lake,"If you only have time to visit one palace in Seoul, then go to the Gyeongbokgung Palace, which is found in the Seoul City center. We were very fortunate to arrive right before the changing of the guard, which was an experience in itself. The place is huge, so make sure you wear comfortable shoes. We went during this year's cherry blossom season (April 11, 2018) when cherry blossom trees were in full bloom, which made the palace grounds even more picturesque. Rent a traditional Korean outfit (Hanbok) and admission to the palace grounds is free. Children and students have discounted entrance fees as well.For those who are Kdrama fans (especially of Goblin, which starred Gong Yoo), this is where the female lead Ji Eun-Tak came out of in Seoul when she first went through that famous red door (in Canada)."
huge,"You might want to wear your most comfortable shoes, and avoid summer time. We came August of last year and it was so hot. But worth it. It's interesting and impressive, happy to see that they maintained it."
The first palace ,The first palace . Burn down during war. The best thing is the guard change process in the morning 9.30 . U can see the actual history . If u wear the traditional Korean dress the entry ticket is free. 
Worth a visit,"We happened to chance upon the palace after finishing our meal at Tosokchon Samgyetang for our ginseng chicken. Definitely worth a visit, palace was beautiful and well maintained. Would recommend coming early in the morning to avoid crowds and if you want a picture with the palace guards. Try and catch the change of guards that happens around 10am."
Chanced upon this place,"Happened to walk into the palace thinking of going to the palace museum and coincidentally it was exactly the time for the guards changing ceremony.It was certainly interesting and quite an experience. Not so sure, but I do think they keep to traditions and everything is authentic.The whole ceremony took about 15 mins. There was Chinese, English, Japanese commentary alongside Korean.Kinda pity the guards though, had to stand straight without moving a muscle while out in the cold weather. But I guess back them hundreds of years ago that's what they did. "
Huge grounds with lots to see,"We came here since it was part of the Discover Seoul Pass. The palace is one of the first things that you see but what we didn't know was that the palace grounds had plenty of other things to look at. We spent a morning just walking around looking at the different buildings and views. The building over the lake, Gyeonghoeru, was an interesting one to see. We also ended up in a display for Princess Myeongseong which was nice cause it was inside one of the buildings.The maps were handy and since it's all numbered, it's fairly easy to get around and find the area you are looking for. We ended up leaving at an exit near the National Folk Museum.A really interesting place where you can easily spend a day just looking at all the different buildings."
Great place to spend an afternoon,"One of the many palaces in Seoul, this one is a must see. The grounds and palace are well kept and you will be sure to get a taste of Korean history. Be sure to do a tour if you can. "
Wear comfortable shoes!,It’s the largest palace in Korea so it’s huge and impressive but there is a lot of walking around in the sun (there is little shade there). Wear comfortable shoes! 
Interesting - Beautiful,Excellent place to walk around; as well as; noting all of the beautiful costumes worn by many. I would visit again but at a different time because of the amount of people there. A huge palace with a lot of area to cover.
😘,A great spot to take a pics or vlogging! Although i was here when it was winter (its suuuuper cold) but i really like the palace :( i havent explore this place much bcs of the bad weather. But this palace is so great ok recommended
Koreanovela Memory Lane,Very nice place to walk around and enjoy the old Korea. Hanging out here is a must and you may even wan to wear traditional dresses.
"Huge palace, thought it was just ok, not great. Too many people","We came here after visiting Changdeokgung Palace, as we had the Secret Garden tour booked for 10:30am, so by the time we got here, it was already super crowded. Changdeokgung was nothing like this, not many people at all. Anyway, so we bought tickets and started walking around. The grounds are huge, so many houses etc. to see but I wasn't as impressed with Gyeongbokgung as I was with Changdeokgung. I have to say though that the Secret Garden at Changdeokgung was my favorite things, so maybe that's way. If I'd come again, I'd visit first thing in the morning, or just before they close. It's still nice though, not to miss."
Check it Out!,"What impressive about this place it is in the heart of Seoul. A mini escape. we arrived on a Wednesday and it was free entry. Beautiful grounds, amazing history. When I go back to Seoul I will go back for another look as it is definitely worthwhile."
The Icon of Seoul,"A short visit to this place. I went to this place with the Korean traditional cloth - Hanbok. We rent the cloth nearby this place. When we visited Gyeongbokgung, the place is big and quiet crowded because it was the first week of spring and the students got two free-day. Well we didn't really get complete information about this place because our short time and we preferred to make some photos. "
Lovely Palace and Grounds,"Having visited the Forbidden Palace in Beijing, the Seoul counterpart is smaller, less crowded, more quaint, but no less grand. The aesthetics and beauty are Superior to Beijing in almost every way.Also a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the place feels earthy and calm. Of course, the city has sprouted up all around, obscuring what must have once been a superlative view. The palace and gardens are quite magnificent. There is quite a bit of greenery and foilage unlike the Forbidden City. While it is impossible to not compare the two, the Seoul Palace stands on its own as a place of magnificance and wonder. Get the Royal Pass and visit at least the Secret Garden and the Temple across the street. Worth the extra few 1000 won(2-3 dollars)"
Awesome History,Amazing historic landmark. A must-see. Join one of the tours given by student volunteers. Really great to see the pride and knowledge the youth have for their history. Very friendly and welcoming staff. Be sure to visit the gift shop for unique palace replica mementos and refreshing teas in the cafe within the shop.
A taste of the past,"Gyeongbokgung Palace is one of the places to visit in Seoul. It’s a must see place on your visit and gives you a real taste of history. It’s around 3,000 KRW to enter but if you turn up wearing a traditional Hanbok, which many do for great photographic opportunities, you can get in for free. Be sure you watch one of the two daily changing of the guard ceremonies. A great spectacle. Also, be sure to confirm opening times as it closes a couple of day per week. Enjoy. "
Huge and beautiful,Wear a hanbok and enter free. Well preserved with huge grounds. Structures were maintained. We were not able to watch the famous changing of the guards but you can take photo with them. Background of the palaces were made where you can read in english version. Easy access trough gyeongbokgung station.
Surprises around every corner,"One way to get there is by subway - Line 3 exit 5 Gyeongbokgung Station. This will bring you out directly in front of the National Palace Museum and you can freely enter a side gate into the entry courtyard. To enter the palace proper, you'll need a ticket - from the ticket booth directly across from the side gate (to the right if you enter the main gates). This was my first Korean palace and I wasn't disappointed. Many ordinary people were dressed in Hanboks (traditional dress available for free), which made the atmosphere of the palace come alive. I liked the smaller details of the walls, buildings, statues, and the few items around ie cauldrons. In some places, the grounds were empty space where buildings used to be, but there were other surprises around every corner. This could be the statues of the National Folk Museum or the massive pagoda (not the one by the lake) - You can't miss it. Note: These are still on the grounds but outside the palace - Keep your tickets to re-enter the palace. Well worth a visit."
Stunning Palace,Changdeokgung palace is called the palace of illustrious virtue. It is a unique Korean palace built in harmony with the landscape. While we were there we were lucky enough to see the people dressed in national costumes a great photo opportunity.
Must Visit in Seoul,"Such a rich historical site in Seoul, a lot of travelers visited Gyeongbokgung Palace that day even it was a winter. I took many photos and memories. You can find hanbok (traditional dress) rental around and enter the palace for free. Very recommended."
NICE,"Going to historical places is such an interesting thing, you can see the colorful buildings the way they were built, in places like these you will probably see people wearing their traditional Korean attire waking around taking pictures which is popular to do"
Amazing Palace!,Very peaceful and our favorite Palace of South Korea. You can rent a traditional dress (Renting places are very close to this Palace and we rented it 15.000 Won for 2 hours) 
Nice Historical Place to Visit,"This palace inherits centuries of history way back from 15th. It was destroyed and rebuilt somewhere in 19th century.Fully built with wood, the main meeting hall is an amazing architecture. Can spend a half day in here, including the neighbouring muzeum. "
Biggest and Best,"One your trip to Seoul you have to visit one of the palaces. This one is the biggest. I’d describe it more like a compound . In that it has many buildings and courtyards within the outside walls. The cost is just a few dollars to enter the main gate. You will likely see folks dressed in traditional Korean attire waking around taking pictures etc. it’s popular to do, and encouraged in that they get in free if they are dressed accordingly. We saw at least two wedding parties taking photos there. There are English translations on most displays. I believe you can rent audio guides if you want. The palace grounds are large, with ponds and courtyards. It’s a very night stroll around to check it all out."
Korean history ,"Visited the palace with kids, the palace had guards dressed in their traditional outfits there were heaps of tourists dressed in traditional dresses too really colorful and a pretty site.The palace itself is quite large has multiple gates and building. You could spend anywhere from 30 mins to a couple of hours. There are restrooms around the a traditional tea house. There is also attached is a arts museum which can be visited"
Be sure to hire a hanbok to wear here,"This is a nice looking palace with large grounds.The experience is heightened by dressing in the colourful traditional Korean clothes called hanbok. You get free entry to the palace grounds if you wear a hanbok and you won't be out of place as there are many others wearing hanbok as well. We were able to get men and women hanbok for 5000 won each for 2 hours, at ABC Hanbok Rental which is located on the second floor of a building across the road from the palace on the Geonchunmun Gate side.Changing of guard ceremonies at 1pm and 2pm were worth watching, as well as guard training at 1:35pm. A 'Mexican wave' of swords drill was particularly impressive! There are free guided tours as well. There was an English speaking guided tour at 1:30pm, which seemed quite popular. We didn't go to that as the timing clashed with the guard training session.A good place to get a photo is the banquet hall to the left side surrounded by water and mountain in the background."
Tourist,Gyeongbokgung palace is very impressiveIt is a large place and in the open It tells us about the culture the history and how people lived in that era. It has a lovely walkway enveloped with lovely cherry blossom trees and benches to rest on. A lovely place to capture photographs. It has a small cafe to unwind. Entry is free if one wears the traditional clothes which can be hired in a nearby place. It was wonderful to see so many youngsters wearing their Grady costumes with lovely hairstyles and wearing gorgeous accessories. We took many pictures with them and wished we had also hired those traditional clothes I highly recommend a visit to the Gyeongjokjung Palace
"Nice palace, but not the best one","Very nice palace, with a beautiful lake, but very crowded and not much to see inside. People seem to go there mostly to take pictures in hanboks and not to experience the place itself. Entrance is very cheap. "
Great for pictures. ,"It’s a lovely complex. I personally skipped the tour because I could get the history online (and there are video clips of the tour). Also, if you are looking for a reduction in crowds, get there just before the changing of the guard (everyone is watching them, so you have more photo opportunities without the crowds). This worked for me because I had other cultural activities on my itinerary. I did a quick walk around by myself in under an hour. "
Amazing Palace/ 100% must do in Seoul!,Absolutely stunning I will recommend fitting a visit while on Seoul.We went on a Sunday and loads of Koreans and even more tourists were dressing up with the traditional Hanok which made the palace and it’s surroundings have an even more special feeling.Need to buy ticket at the counter but costs only around £3.Must do to visit the building with the lake for amazing shots.
One of the best palaces to visit,"There are a lot of palaces in Seoul, but Gyeongbokgung is definitely one of the more interesting palaces. It can be quite busy at times so make sure to check the best times of day to visit. If visiting at night is an option I would recommend this during summer as there is an amazing light show running every hour. Friendly to all ages."
Incredible. Impressive. Beautiful... some of it is closed down for maintenance but still worth it.,"Impressive palace with lots of history and culture. The place is massive, with lots of ground to cover and sites to see. The moat with island was closed and under maintenance when we visited in April 2018. I think it is set to re-open this fall. You can peek in from open windows and see over the wall at times from around the grounds however.Located in downtown Seoul, you can see this palace in a couple hours and right next door on the way out is the Nation Folk Museum. I recommend seeing all of the palace before going to the folk museum as you will not be let back on the palace grounds after 5PM."
Large Scale Complex - Lots of Walking,We did not realize the scale of this palace complex. The most interesting part was the Koreans (and likely tourists) that dress up in traditional costumes to visit the Palace. This certainly adds to the effect and sense of history.
So much history! Great place to visit!,Do make sure that you dress up in hanbok (you can hire them nearby) and walk around the grounds of the palace. Make sure you are there for the changing of the guards because it is an amazing sight. It is a truly beautiful palace and a big part of the history of South Korea.
Stunning,"Had 13 hours on a layover in Seoul so only enough time to see 1 of the many beautiful sights in the city. So glad I chose Gyeongbokgung Palace. The complex is huge, the architecture stunning. It was quite busy but that did not deter from my enjoyment. Serene, beautiful and made me want to see more so definitely planning a return trip. I would highly recommend a visit if you are in Seoul; even for a layover. Took about 1.5 hours each way to get there from the airport but well worth the time."
Beautiful palace,This former kings palace in Korea is amazing. It reminds me of the forbidden city but on a slightly more human scale. I love that one is allowed to just wonder around and linger in shady spots. It is adored by the teenagers who wonder how one could have lived here. I highly recommend a visit even on a short trip to Seoul. 
Self-Guided Tour ,Beautiful and majestic palace with views of Seoul and the surrounding hills. The self/ guided tour is easy with literature available in multiple languages. Allow enough time to tour the grounds and see the beautiful cherry blossoms (in April) and architecture. 
Wonderful landmark,You can reach here by seoul metro and stop at Gwa ghamun station. The palace is great and have much instagramable spots to take.
Must visit palace in Seoul!,"If one has to pick one palace to visit in Seoul, I would recommend Gyeongbokgung palace! We went at 1000am in the morning and watched the colorful change of guard ceremony. The palace is huge and takes time and lot of walking to explore the entire place. It was spring time and quite beautiful with the cherry blossoms. Lot of tourists and locals in hanbok added to the colorful atmosphere. There is a cafe inside to take rest after walking and warming up in cold weather. The palace is spread out so it doesnt feel crowded even when there are lot of people around. It was an enjoyable visit."
A delayed flight got us a palace tour from ICN,"While mechanical problems in Seattle caused us to miss our connection to India, the 24 hour delay awaiting our next connection opportunity gave us an awesome chance to see some of Korea. The first stop on our free layover tour provided by Incheon Airport was Gyeongbokgung Palace. Steeped in history, and quite well preserved, the Palace grounds we found were quite large, and filled with palace structures and artifacts. The interiors of the palace were quite well preserved, awash in colored interior spaces, and the palace was teaming in costumed Korean soldiers of around 16th century Korea. The changing of the guard ceremony happens in the afternoon, and it's quite a flamboyant spectacle with many costumed participants. The ceremony lasts around a half an hour, and is well worth a pic or two. To add to the historical flavor, many locals come in costume to the Palace, and parade around the grounds. I had heard many weddings also take place at the Palace, however, that was just traveler talk, nothing from anyone official.Self guiding audio tours with earbuds are available in many languages at the entry, and there seemed to be an ample supply. As far as entry costing goes, I have no idea, as it was included in our airport layover tour.We found it worth the effort, and would recommend it to anyone exploring Seoul."
Royal Palace,"It was built in 1395, it continued to serve as the main palace of the Joseon dynasty until the premises were destroyed by fire during the Imjin War and abandoned for two centuries"
All the Korean historical drama feels,"The place was huge, get your hanbok and you can get inside for free, you could tour all the palaces, it's just the distances between them takes a long walk. One hour is not enough to tour this place."
Lots to see,"This palace site is REALLY big and even on our guided tour we probably only saw about half of it.Hard to tell what is original and what is rebuilt - take that as a criticism or a compliment, it works both ways.The changing of the guard was colourful and loud and looked pretty professional. Lots and lots of schoolkids made it a bit manic at timesNeeded lots more insitu explanation boards and direction signs"
Improvements needed for tourists,"Palace is beautiful but disappointed that it didn’t have clear directions.I wish the buildings were labeled with a numbering system (and a starting point) and a more detailed explanation of each structure. Info pamphlet, 500 won, was in very small font and difficult to read. Also, it would be nice if the cleaning staff can clean and quietly during non-tour hours. They were yelling at each other inside the structures with the tourists looking on. We were at the Nijo Castle in Kyoto just couple of days prior to this visit. Plenty of explanations and quiet working staff in uniform. Also, it was disappointing to see sub-par restorations (for some parts) to a national treasure. "
A must visit for all first timers to Seoul,"I think a visit to Seoul for any first timer is not complete without a stopover to this Grand Palace located in the heard of Seoul. A grand palace it is indeed! The grounds were well kept, and the landscaping made it so serene and calm (apart from the busy groups of tourists taking selfies in their beautiful rented hanboks)The changing of the guards is a must see too!"
Knowledgeable Guide,"The last time when I took the English tour, the guide was merely running through basics. But I brought my parents along this time around and we joined the Chinese tour. It was one of the most enjoyable time during our stay there. The guide was knowledgeable and friendly. "
"Interesting, but not so much fun at 5 degrees F","We went to see the changing of the guard at 9:00 a.m. Very nice presentation, with dozens of elaborately, historically dressed soldiers. The Palace complex is a grand, interesting sight, but that’s about it. As a foreign tourist who has a limited knowledge of Korea, I couldn’t quite appreciate the history by walking around looking at buildings. Most viewing was only from the outside, except occasionally being allowed to look inside a door or window. Nearby was the Korean National Folk Museum, which focused more on the Korean way of life, including the evolution of the clothing, cooking, farming and family upbringing."
It's alright ,"I think is the best historic place in Seoul, but there are better shrines in other Asian countries. If you are not a history gig and don't understand much about these places , so it would like all others shrines. Only thing makes it little different is the size. Is really big."
Beautiful palace,"Seoul has about 5 palaces to see but gyeongbokgung is the most interesting for me. It is situated in an area surrounded by a Mountain View with nearby places like museums, restaurants and the bukchon hanok village. Experience the changing of the guards at 11am and 2pm."
Fun place to take photos with hanbok,Near the palace there are hanbok rent places. You can rent there and take photos at Gyeongbokgung. The palace is look like the one in the dramas so you can pretend to be the protagonist of saeguk dramas for a moment
A great photography location for Hanbok,"The Gyeongbokgung Palace was our highlight of the trip because we rented Hanbok, the traditional dress to take pictures here. For those wear Hanbok or Korean Traditional Clothes, no entrance fee is required. We rented our Hanbok at a nearby shop. Within walking distance, we can reach the Palace. The scenery was beautiful and when we took the pictures, we thought we were transported back to the ancient time. You can see many different colors and design of Hanbok in the Palace. The view was spectacular. Gyeongbokgung Palace is the most visited among the five palaces in Seoul. Hence, you can expect the number of visitors here. We took every opportunity to take pictures while admiring the beauty of this Palace. We then visited the museum to learn more about the history of the Palace and the emperors."
Way back,"Great place, if you're wearing a hanbuk (Korean traditional dress) your entrance is totally FREE.. Explore the Korean world, ild Korean Style"
Don’t miss - guard change shift,"do go early to watch the guards changing shift ceremony which start at 10am. The whole ceremony last about 20mins, you can take photo with the guard thereafter but remember don’t touch them "
Pretend like it’s your own drama,"My friends and I were limited with time so we went to the most touristy of the touristy and it did not disappoint. Although it rained and stayed cloudy for the rest of the day (so there wasn’t a changing of the guards ceremony), it was breathtakingly beautiful. Every inch of the palace was photo-worthy. What I loved the most was that it was free to enter if you rented a hanbok! "
Rent a hanbok,"If you want a full on memorable experience here, rental a hanbok before you go. The girls wearing them were so cute that I regretted not getting one. This place is great for photo ops and roaming around the entire place to learn about how they lived centuries ago. It’s huge so you could spend at least 2 hours here. Not recommended on a hot summer day because you’re pretty much out out in the open. This one is larger than the UNESCO palace and better in my opinion. If you’re visiting Seoul, Myeongdong this is highly recommended. It’s walking distance to the cute Bukchon Village where people roam around in their hanboks as well. Great experience, I’d do it again but this time wearing a hanbok. "
Worth a visit once,"A must see location for tourists, but once you see one Korean palace, you've seen all korean palaces."
Beautiful grounds,A highlight of our visit was the changing of the guard ceremony at 10am. We also got to see some cherry blossoms. Well restored buildings and brochures telling about the history are available in English.
a must see,a great place to visit. would recommend planning your visit ahead of time as the palace is not open every day (closed on Tuesdays i thInk). There are set times for changing of the guards so again check out the times if you want to see this
Revisit,"Visited 20 yrs ago. A v quite palace but now a bit crowded. Visitors wearing traditional Korea costume, taking fotos everywhere, esp under the cherry tree. A bit annoying"
For my lack of knowledge...,"Only gave it a passing review - because I did this without a tour, and it was really boring :X. The compound is huge, u can't step into the building but look at it from outside only. There's tons of tourists wearing hanbok which I feel it is one of the must-do experience. As u venture into the further parts, there are less and lesser tourists but the same building and mini gardens, sigh - tour guide is a must.Don't miss the guard changing routing like I did :( there's 2 rounds of it in a day check out the timing. "
Lovely Place,"Nice to see a palace from Joseon Dynasty, I watched Korean drama and Joseon Era is always shown. Nothing much to see inside, the fee was $3; some people dressed up in hanbok dresses and walked around the palace and take pictures. The change of guards was great to see, they do it every half hour."
JFK JROTC Cadets Tour ,"The Palace is beautiful. Our tour guide, with quite a sense of humor, did a great job explaining the history and present-day status of the palace. There as a medium-sized crowd overall, and good thing we had our jackets! It was cold!! The palace is worth visiting! Truly iconic! If you have limited time, be sure to add this to your tour list! Lots of nearby restaurants too. The mountain scenery is breathtaking! "
Well worth the visit,"Try to get to the palace for the 10am guard changing. Seeing all the tourists in traditional costume is hilarious, and like nothing I’ve seen anywhere in the world. Sadly, the palace is mostly a replication of the 14thc original, which burned down and was sacked by conquerers, but still a worthy visit. "
Hmmmm,This was the first palace I went to and I'm not sure if I find it that amazing... Probably if I have more time to go around and explore the entire compound. There were many tourists around that was probably why I did not enjoy it that much. It's great for experience purposes if you want to get exposed to Korean culture. There are a lot of things to do outside as well so you need not worry where to eat and stuff. It's also near other famous palaces and Insadong.
"One of the landmark in Seoul, South Korea","The largest and oldest palace in Seoul, which is one in five of the palaces.This place combines historical stories,beautiful architecture and nature. I love here. Recommend to visit."
Take the free guided tour,"This palace is very large and grand. It was nice catching the performance of the changing of guards. If you missed the performance here, you can catch another one at Deoksugong. Our Chinese guide for the free tour impressed us with her good language skills and extensive knowledge. We learnt a lot about the Korean history and culture. The visit will not be half as good without the guide, it would just be buildings of which we would know little about. To take the tour, wait at the appointed time at the black stand just after the entrance. Highlights were the building in which Korean language Hanggul was invented by King Sejong (although original is no longer there), pavilion with rows of cherry blossoms in front of lake, hidden dragons at the main shrine hall, the decorated main chimney chute for emissions from ten rooms. Other than that the rest are similar to the other palaces. Each palace has a different history and usage, we visited each one in the combined pass each time taking the guided tour and it was still interesting. Don’t miss out the Korean folk museum and the north village which have free admission and are connected to the palace."
Amazing,The place was so big and amazing. Very unique on its own. The people will also perform their traditional dance and parade.
Visiting while wearing Hanbok,"When visiting Gyeongbokgung Palace, you must wear the traditional korean clothes ( don't pay the entrance fee ) It gives the tour a special feeling of the past times."
Great Palace in the middle of the town,"Huge and Massive. The two words that you can describe about this Palace. Full of many tourist who wearing old traditional costume of South Korea and walking as well taking picture in many corner of this palace. A must see place that you should visit when in Seoul. Very simple to find and walking distance to some hotels, other tourist area and main attraction. "
interesting,"This was a very nice visit, I went for the tour which had a lot of rich information about the culture, architecture and so on. If you wear a hanbok (typical Korean outfit) you can get in for free, they rent them in many places near the palace. I didn't try the hanbok option but I found it as a really cute option especially if you are into taking pictures."
Lots to see-bring walking shoes,"The Palace is huge with lots of buildings to see. We were treated to the changing of the guard which had local people dressed in period costumes. The changing of the guard was quite colorful and according to our guide was authentic. One could take a lot of pictures of the changing of the guard in addition to the interior and exterior of the various buildings that were on the palace grounds. On the palace ground is also the National Palace Museum of Korea which housed a good collection of the emperor's personal belongings, the cars, clothes, and items used in the daily living. Between the Palace and the Museum, plan to spend about 4 hours plus to see everything. There is also a small snack stand where one can get a cold drink and sit for some time to rest up."
Fabulous place to visit,It’s fun if you rent the Korean traditional clothes (hanbok) and visit it free. The hanbok gives the place a festive atmosphere. The place is big and has a lot of places you can take pictures at.
A huge palace. Must visit.,The palace was huge and it took us more than 1 hour to cover all areas. We took the free guide to take us around the palace and it was useful as we were able to discover more than just seeing the areas inside the palace.
A must visit ,"Definitely a must visit place in Seoul. Such a beautiful and huge palace. I do recommend to get a tour guide to understand better, unless you want to freely wander around."
Very wide!,Do this activity on a day you are feeling energetic because this place is huge! Avoid on the weekends because there are many protesters in the nearby area on Sat/Sun. Wear a Hanbok to get some stunning photos! There are tons of local shops nearby!
Beautiful,"We loved walking around the palace when the cherry blossoms were just coming out, it’s worth getting a free map and planning your walk to visit each of the amazing buildings. My only disappointment was that a number of the buildings were undergoing renovation and access was prohibited."
Beautiful and Serene,The grounds were very beautiful and peaceful. There are lots of places to take pictures. You must really time your visit around the changing of the guards ceremony. In addition go to the neighboring shops where you can rent traditional outfits for the hour or time duration of your choice. It really adds a special feel when you are wearing the traditional clothing and visiting the palace grounds.
very nice preserved palace and great ceremony,"we visited the palace on a sunny day. it's inportan6to have explanations from a guide, so j recommend a guided tour. don't miss the change of guards ceremony. twice a day. check.well tines because the official site is not always accurate.the screening is very colorful and beautiful. the tourif palace is also extreme nice enjoy"
Transported back in time ,"What a beautiful place , right in the middle of the city Could spend a few hours there +museum if the weather is nice . The area is walkable also if you want to explore after spending time at the palace "
Tried guard costumes for free,"Near the entrance to the left, there is a small house offering free guard costumes for tourists and guests. They have schedules posted on what time they open so better take note of the time. The catch is you can only wear it and get to take a picture just nearby the house, you cannot go far and roam around. So when you have the chance, take all the pictures you can get with your group of friends and do all the poses you can make."
A Must See but Self Tour for Free,"Loved walking around the Palace and grounds. I opted to do a self guided tour for free and glad I did. I passed by many guided/paid tours and though you do learn a little more than reading the signage posted, I do not feel I missed anything and was able to spend more time where I wanted and move on quickly when the lines were long and slow.There are many young girls and boys in period clothing which was fun to see and capture in pictures. Seems to be the thing to do for the young!"
Not very interesting,"Admission ticket is 3000 won, palace closed at 6pm, and last admission is at 5pm. A very huge compound, lotsa walking but nothing much to see except if its sakura else you see many people taking photos, young couples strolling (and more photos taking). Basically this is a paid admission to walk around the big compound. There is of course guards changing performance else I can't convince myself what else to see.The museum across is another different story."
Beautiful palace,I went on a Saturday morning around 11 am so I could see the change of the guard act. It is ok but nothing that you will feel disappointed if you miss it. The palace is huge and interesting. Some of the pavilions were closed for repairing.There were a lot of tourists and some of them hired Korean traditional customs. Be ready to have lots of girls dressed up in Korean traditional dresses spending ages in different parts of the palace taking pictures. They are an absolute nightmare. They take and retake pictures and selfies for hours.I felt that there should be some information about the different buildings and their function. 
To people who likes the history,Don't miss this place If you're interested about history of Korean culture. This palace where you can see the king was living during the ancient centuries. 
Join a free tour!,"Lovely palace, and best appreciated if you join the free tour. You can also rent a hanbok in nearby shops -- I believe you get free admission if you do."
Must see,"Firstly, this is one place to catch the glance, understand the culture. Most cetainly, this is a must for vising Corea/Seoul."
"Beautiful Palace, Amazing History","We went on a free Seoul airport tour to see this palace and did not get to see everything. It is a massive place where one should set aside a few hours to explore. We also went in the winter, when it was cold. I imagine in the summer it's a lot better. With that said, I really enjoyed walking and taking pictures of the various buildings. There wasn't too many places to go inside, but one could look into some of the main buildings, such as the throne room of the king. This is pretty much a ""must see"" if you are going to Seoul and it is located right near the center of the city, so there's no excuse to miss it unless such things bore you."
Experience in Hanbok ,"Fee entrance with Hanbok attire. A lot of Hanbok rental shop Nearby. 2 hours of rental cost from KRW10,000 is sufficient for us to take photo and walk around."
the palace you must visit,"Out of four palaces, Gyeongbukgong is the main palace. What I love about this place, it was easy to find when you exit Gwanghwamun Station. It was so big and can be seen far away. The changing guard ceremony will be held at 10 am on the front lawn."
One of the main highlights in Seoul ,"Must see.One of the main attractions in the city.The area is huge. So make sure you have enough time. Traditional costumes are available, so you can dress up and take nice pics. The main event that takes place there several times a day is the changing of the guard. It’s a good show, very colorful. Make sure you check the schedule, all the guidebooks have it. Don’t miss it.And there is a fantastic museum nearby - the Folk Museum. Highly recommended as well."
Grand Historical Palace in the City,It's a must visit while in Seoul. Historical architecture and daily changing of guards ceremony for public viewing. Every last Wednesday of the month is Cultural Day at the Palace and entrance fees are waived. We were there on the last Wednesday of March and was wonderfully surprised to see locals and tourists visiting in their traditional costume that is the hanbok! What a lovely sight! Highly recommended to visit the palace while in Seoul!
Excellent,"I spend almost 2 hours here, so many beautiful places here, and it's huge. you should come in spring and autumn. I think it will be a great picture to take. Don't forget to rent Hanbok (Korean traditional dress) "
Seoul Icon,"You must to visit the Gyeongbokgung Palace one you landed here in Seoul, i guarantee you'd be amaze. Traditional cultural building in the middle of metropolitan city and yet it's blend very well. One thing that you should watch is the Guard Exchange Ceremony."
Have to visit ,The palace is amazing need to visit .. am not history fan guy .. but the place is big and you can take long walk and see the palace and have great pic 
The Main Palace to Visit in Seoul,"The Gyeongbokgung Palace was the main royal palace of the Joseon dynasty and was definitely a must-visit on our Seoul bucket list.. Built in 1395, it is located in northern part of Seoul and with that said, it was a rather gobsmacking experience to observe how much Seoul has modernised over the years just by standing at the entrance of the palace. The colours, design and interior of the palace was remarkable and well-preserved over the years. I visited the place at 1pm, just in time for their change-of-guard ceremony which lasted for about 10 minutes. It was an interesting performance to witness and thank goodness for perfect timing. Expect a lot of tourists dressed up in hanboks (traditional Korean garments) lining up to take a photo with the palace guards or posing everywhere along the palace grounds (and I mean it, EVERY WHERE). I visited the palace on a Tuesday (mind you it was a non-holiday season) and it was packed. I can't imagine what it would be like on a weekend!There are free tours of the palace grounds in English but I did not follow the crowd as I started getting annoyed at the number of tourists mindlessly carrying their selfie sticks and swinging them around everywhere. It was just me though, I dislike crowded places and flocks of tourists. Worth a visit, nevertheless!"
Palace to visit in Seoul,"Nice place for tourists, especially the changing of guards, it will be more meaningful when you are able to see it. If I'm not mistaken its 2pm."
Closed every Tuesday,"We made the mistake of going in a Tuesday, but was still able to see the surroundings and go to the museum, which was also free."
Very beautiful Palace,"The place is really big, was there just as the guards switched and was very nice. Most Korean wore traditional clothing which was nice too. Would definitely recommend a visit when you’re in Seoul. "
Most impressing sight in Seoul,This is the largest and most impressing of the royal palaces in SeoulNot to be missedAfter visit this Palace there are interesting neighborhoods and markets near by also museums so you can plan a full day of. Sightseeing in this area before heading to the famous shopping and street food areas
Amazing,"If you are visiting Seoul, Gyeongbokgung Palaca is a MUST! You can only see the gardens with a guided tour, which you can arrange inside (many languages available)."
awesome!,Nice view of the palaces and picturesque place to go around. Enjoyed my sightseeing! Some areas are under restoration and renovations. Place is quite huge but feast for the eyes!
Worth a Visit,"I had been to Seoul many times, but never able to visit Gyeongbokgung Palace. Glad I did this last trip. They have free guided tours in English which last and hour which was helpful in learning more about the palace and grounds. The changing of the guard ceremony happens at 10 and 2."
Worth a short visit. Wear Hanbok for free admission.,"Right, before you visit this place be sure to rent a Hanbok outfit! It really does make the whole experience worthwhile. You get to pick your outfit and walk the palaces amongst tourists and locals also doing the same. Admission to the palaces is free if you're wearing the Hanbok outfits :DIts really scenic and quiet and its rather beautiful. However we couldn't find much information on the buildings themselves so I'd recommend a guided tour if you're really interested. We could only explore for an hour as we only rented the Hanbok for an hour but you could easily spend a couple of hours here."
Beautiful ceremony of gate guard change,"We got there a bit late, couldn’t go through the gate anymore. But it was probably better to watch it at the front of the palace, later they let us in, we still saw the band, the marching columns, Colorful/ beautiful costumes . It lasted about an half hour. In the end we got to take pictures with generals and soldiers . Was fun."
The first place to visit when in Korea..,"This was our first place to visit after our breakfast at the hotel.It was winter that time but the sun is out .The place was huge and while we were walking,our guide was telling us the story of the Palace.I recommend to visit this place first hour during your visit in seoul because you can no longer take the pictures you like if there are many people already."
"Disappointed, but still worth to go","I walked the whole palace. I was giving high hope to review the history and how the emperor or ancient Korean lived. However, it seems like no one comment this is a REBUILD of everything!!!! You can still be amazing by the size and the building structure. However, beside the main palace all other places are empty..... A bit disappointed because I like to understand the Korean culture more. Still you can see the Korean government's effort to rebuild the palace and allow tourists understand their past."
Great place to Visit in the city,"It’s a very scenic palace and it’s a must go place for tourist whom visit Seoul. But unfortunately for us that coming to Seoul on Seollal Day, the palace closed early than it supposed to so it is very disappointing as we are unable to go in even though it still early. It stated that the palace closed at 4.30pm due to the Public Holiday as we already reached there at 4.20pm, they are not allowing us to get in. So it is really saddening me cause it is my dream place to visit. What we can only do is taking a picture outside the palace. "
The Korean royal history,The palace is an interesting area to visit. Plenty of information to learn about how the king and queen lived before capitalism ruled over. The ritual of changing of guards at 10am Seoul time in the vicinity of the palace is not to be missed. 
Amazing experience!,"I paid a visit with my couple just a few days before she went back to her Homeland, and we had an amazing time.First of all, ""Nightseeing"". During summer, they also open during night time, and usually foreigners had special price (which is more expensive) in any country; in the palace, foreigners have an opportunity to get a different personal daily quota (Some Koreans may not have a place... but we got it).Moreover, they held presentations, special lighting and a very unique opportunity to see Seoul and Korea's history in a whole different way."
Crowded but still worth a trip,This is probably the main palace most tour guides and groups take tourists to. That being said it is crowded if you go at the wrong time. Admission is free if you wear a hanbok(korean traditional wear). Once you stray a bit from the main entrance it does quiet down but be prepared for crowds on days with nice weather. There are sometimes protests going on in the surrounding area outside the main gates. 
Beautiful palace,It is a must to visit this beautiful palace and watch the Changing Guard Ceremony... It has a beautiful place to give us imagination about what happened in the Korean Dynasty long long time ago...
"Gyeongbokgung, Palace of Memories","Seeing Gyeongbokgung Palace is on the A list for tours, but beyond the history and the culture, the thing that I enjoyed most was watching Koreans take pictures in their traditional clothing, Hanbok. This is a serious activity for Koreans, especially for the young in love, engaged or recently married. There are ""required"" photo ops and it was fun watching the ""romantics"" cue up for traditional photo spots. I offered to take photos for several groups so that everyone could get into the picture and they allowed me to take their picture as well. Some even invited me to pose with them and shot a picture for me on my camera! Note: If you wear a hanbok, then admittance is free to the Palace. Over 65 are also free. I also shot pictures of all the Haechi statues at the palace. The Haechi (a picture of which is on almost every Seoul taxi) is a mythical lion-like horned creature that often appears in myths as a guardian against fire and disasters. A large Haechi statue stands on guard in front of Gyeongbokgung Palace, protecting the nation. Also, there is a nice place to have a tea or other beverage and small pastry."
Lack of Historical Naration,"The place is very BIG and clean, but historical naration to the tourist is not sufficient. Only some area has a naration."
Our Beautiful Walk,"It was worth paying that 3000w we paid for each person. We had a long walk, good thing we went towards the end of winter so walking was not a problem since the weather was very good!!! Its nuce too that ladies wear the hanbok and the setting was perfect. Beautiful sceneries and architecture"
A must to visit in Seoul,Visiting this palace makes you feel you're in a Korean historical drama while wearing Hanbok which is free entrance when you wear it. The place is very big and many spot for instagram photos. One of the best is the lake view.
Korea adventure ,We had fun inside the palace. We rented Korean costume and had lots of fun photos. The best one in the one in the lake. It was postcard quality photos. Highly recommend to come and visit this place when you are in Korea. 
Beautiful Gyeongbokgung Palace,"I have been to Gyeongbokgung Palace for more than 5 times and all are different season. Those most I like is during Autumn. The lake is so beautiful. Many people visited this palace dressing Hanbok, its make the place looks like very historical. I love the architecture of the palace. Its so classic and beautiful. The information about the palace is very clear. The ambience is so nice and relaxing."
Impressive,Architecture was great and we arrived just in time for the changing of guard ceremony. Good place to visit.
Stunning Architecture,This palace reminded me so much of the Forbidden City of Beijing except Gyeongbokgung had way more signs explaining the historical context. It's definitely worth a visit!
Seouless...,"It is hard to be impress by the palace if you have been to China. Those are bigger, more grand and more historically significant than the ones in Seoul. There is a lot of empty spaces with just sands and normal trees. Very little historical information are given and the whole place just feel souless. Better off to visit the national museum nearby. You can also see many people dressed in Korean hanbok but I find it gimmicky, you do received free entrance if you do that as well. It is one of those places you go so you can said I been there."
A must visit place in Seoul,A must visit place in Seoul and main attraction palace ... It is a good initiative that people who dressed in Korean hanboks received free entrance to the palaces during the day ...
Feel the Breath of History,"Biggest and in my opinion best palace in Seoul. Great for photo sessions because you can always find some good spots without any people. Also, service is available in English, Korean, Japanese and Chinese so no problem with sightseeing. I've already gone there like 20 times and gonna back anytime"
Must visit place in Seoul,"One of the must visit places in Seoul. It's a big palace complex where you can not only enjoy traditional architecture but sometimes also performances, such as guard changing ceremony. I've visited this place many times and I definitely recommend to go there dressed in Hanbok. Not only you can enter for free but also the whole experience gets better!"
Impressive,Buildings are awesome and is one of the top attractions in Seoul. It;s kind a similar to Changdeokgung Palace. It;s huge and is amazing.
Main attraction Palace in Seoul,"Love the elevated man made lake as it is such a beautiful spot for a great picture! As it is ending of winter the time I visit, the trees are all bald out but it still looks pretty in the photos. Am sure when spring with all the beautiful leaves and flowers it would look magnificent. "
One of the highlights,"Visited as part of a half-day, multi-site tour. Visiting the palace and watching the changing guards ceremony was definitely one of the highlights. My trip was in early March so we did not get to see the cherry blossoms, but if you visit during the warmer months you will get to experience the blooming season and capture excellent photos and memories."
Must do visit.,"Time this for the changing of the guard. Well worth it for the photo ops. The palace is definitely worthwhile and they are working to get ramps everywhere. So if you are a little disabled it’s ok.The national costume rental, allows the wearer to enter for free.Hint; remember to get a guide book at another counter."
Historic building,"A beautiful place with historic building, if you really like the history things, this place will be the best choice when you visit Seoul.There is a lot of Han-bok renting store near the palace. You can book the traditional hanbok online, then go there change cloth. Go into the palace will be ticket-free with hanbok costume."
Must see!,"It was my first encounter with this kind of architecture and I was thoroughly impressed. I lost my bonnet while I was walking the grounds and lost&found wasn’t very helpful, but it didn’t dim my wonder with the place. You can walk around the buildings at your own pace, and if you are wearing the national custom, entrance is free (you will see dressed up girls everywhere, another delight!). Not that it’s expensive otherwise - I think it’s about 2 or 3 US dollars. I wasn’t there in time for the free tours and I feel I would have loved it even more if I had taken one; for someone who knows very little about Seoul or even Korea, most of the context is lost. In any case, it was a wonderful way to pass the time (stayed there about one hour and a half) and I would come back any time :) "
Changing of the guard ,"Interesting palace, can get crowded at the times for the. Hanging of the guard, but worth it.Recommended "
A Quiet Peaceful Winter Visit,"If you have been to the Forbidden City in Beijing, you will be more tolerant of this rebuilt collection of buildings that is the Gyeongbokgung Palace. Some reviewers complain there isn't much to see here. But I guess it depends upon what your goals are.Yes, the buildings are mostly closed or empty. But the way the palace is built with exposure to weather with unheated buildings, it is understandable why they won't be full of ancient artifacts. You'll find those in museums nearby. I have been here probably five times going back over 30 years, and I never cease to find it a place to calmly reflect on Korea's ancient and interesting history as a keystone located in the heart of East Asia. Additionally, you will find two great museums within its boundary. A great place for leisurely walks and quiet thinking (except on Korean holidays!)."
Beautiful trip into the past,The whole area around this is simply astonishing. Good thing - we got a perfect day with blue sky. Lots of people borrowed local costumes which gave the place a lot of flair. 
Nothing much to see,"I was pretty excited to visit this palace actually. We reached there early in the morning by subway. Once there, people are gathering to watch changing guard ceremony. I thought it's gonna be awesome but it was just average and nothing special about it. We purchased tickets and was asked if I wanted to purchase entrance tickets for all palace. We purchased tickets for Gyeongbokgung Palace only and was glad we did not purchase ticket for all. Nothing much to see inside, not too big or too small. All building are closed. Even if it's open, there's nothing much to see. Nice place to take pictures though. There's a exit gate in the middle of the palace. Exit that way and turn left. You may walk to Bukchon Hanok Village which is just around the corner. 10 minutes walk is required."
Can get crowded,"Very wide palace, wore hanbok when we entered and we availed a free entrance. Be early to get a nice photos"
Good to visit,"For first timers to Seoul, this palace is good to put on the itinerary. Rent a hanbok at the numerous rental places and get free entry into this historical venue where kings and queens reined.Catch the changing of guard ceremony while you are there."
I would choose this palace if I do not have enough time,"Generally, all 4 main palaces in Seoul look the same. If you do not have enough time, Gyeongbokgung should be your first choice. Be there before 10am to watch guard ceremony, recommend to stay 2-3 hours."
Very impressive,Just as we arrived they performed the changing of the guard which was very impressive. The grounds are beautiful and it is relaxing if you just want to sit on a bench and enjoy the scenery. 
Lovely Korean Palace,"Located in the center of the city, its beauty will attract everyone. I went there in the afternoon and it was great. We can feel the ancient times and we will be amazed with the structure and paintings in their details!You can get free ticket also if you go there in hanbok (Korean traditional clothes)!"
Insight into the Rich Korean History,"Gyeongbokgung Palace is one of the five palaces in Seoul area. This is the main palace of the Joseon Dynasty. Although the palace was restored after suffering damages in 1592 and during the Japanese occupation, the palace was restored beautifully by the Koreans. The palace ground is vast and houses many buildings and halls, all having their own use and purpose. We made use of the free guided tour in English, provided by the Palace Management Office. The guided tour explains in detail the purpose and history behind each building in the palace. After the guided tour, we had a much better understanding of Korean history. We also managed to catch the Changing of Palace Guard Ceremony. The ceremony was a reenactment based on historical documents and records. For seniors(over 65 y/o), admission is free (make sure you bring your passport).Would recommend a visit if you are interested in history and ancient architecture. If we had more time in Seoul, we would like to visit few more of the other four palaces."
A palace to remember !,"A palace to remember,you can see,experience and learn something new about history.. if you're a history lover especially to those cultures of different countries,then hooray and come.. for sure you'll love this place.. if you're wearing a hanbuk (cultural dress) then your entrance fee is 100%free,(no need to buy ticket for the entrance )"
2nd visit ,"This is my 2nd visit to the palace , Gyeongbokgung palace was the biggest , 1st visit was with tour guide and he will explain section by section of the palaces , my 2nd visit was on our own , we didn't go inside the palace this time , instead strolling around outside the palace which was beautiful too and it's free . Admiring ladies wearing beautiful Hanbok . If you wear Hanbok korea traditional clothes admission is free for men & ladies . "
Tacky,I visited this palace today. Wow - how boring can a palace be! This one takes the biscuit!! Lots of Koreans all garbed up in traditional Korean dress which they hire locally - even men so they get free admission. Selfies are the order of the day. We maybe just a bit of glamour. Let's get down to hard facts. Lots of buildings - most closed with nothing to see. Those open / nothing inside - again empty rooms - nothing to see. Exceptions: the throne room has a throne in - basic and the Gyeonghoeru Pavilion is of national significance for its important part in architectural design and application. This is not a place to visit even if it only costs 4000 won. The National Palace Museum of Korea is in the same compound (admission free) is excellent. So head there when disillusionment overcomes you from your Palace experience.
Largest of the Palaces near us,"We had a day in Seoul. This large Palace and all the historical information was enough to keep us busy for the the day. We watched the changing of guard, saw lots the architecture, and experience and learnt some of the South Korea’s culture ."
a Great Palace,one of the palaces in the middle of the seoul. Near to gwanghwamun square and choenggyechon stream. the most visited palace among others.
Currently under renovation,Visited this palace in end Feb and a huge part of the palace is under renovation. Will not recommend visiting until renovations are over 
Snow-covered Palace,The scenery was fantastic because of the snow that came down a few days ago. Was very impressive.
A Seoul necessity,"Gorgeous buildings and grounds facing downtown Seoul. Temples, pavilions, shrines, and ponds. Plan at least a couple of hours"
Instaworthy!,"Had a great afternoon there, would recommend it on a sunny day for nice photos. Do rent the hanbok for a perfect photo and check out the restaurants nearby."
Nice old charm,"My mom loves korean movies. Specially old historical movies. It felt i was walking in one of their scenes. Interesting palace. I wish i was there in spring time, i am sure with all the trees and flowers would have looked marvelous"
A must see,"Even if you spend only a few minutes here, Gyeongbokgung Palace is a beautiful and important part of Korean history. The main palace is a stunning example of Korean architecture and it is a great place to sightsee with all the visitors in traditional Korean dress. "
So much to see,"Spent the afternoon at Gyeongbokgung Palace, the National Palace of Korea. We were totally amused watching the guard's antics before and after we entered! It is a huge site with many areas under restoration. The grounds were beautiful and an array of stunning autumn colours set the scene. Many young women/men (and older) in full traditional dress, it was so special to see. A huge site, it was also home to the Korean Fok Museum and Korean Nationa Palace Museum. We spent an afternoon here, but if you want to visit the Museums it could almost be a full day visit.At one gate we were able to go out and see The Blue House which is the executive office and official residence of the South Korean head of state, the President of the Republic of Korea."
Nice to visit,"Walking distance from our hotel, we visited the palace in the morning where there is not much people yet around. Good for taking photos and nice to see Korean architecture. You have to see the changing of guards that takes place at certain hours of the day. You can also rent traditional Korean attire at a few places around the palace to capture awesome memorable pictures."
Peaceful historical sight,We visited the site during the New Year weekend so it was full of visitors wearing their own or rented Hanbok traditional clothing. The atmosphere was very festive with people all dressed up sitting on the steps of the various structures taking photographs. Be sure to look up and enjoy the painted colors of the buildings. There is a brief changing of the guard with drums and flags and guards in colorful period uniforms. The adjacent museum had an english audio guide to assist you through the exhibits
"Must visit on Summer/Autumn, not recommended in Winter",Excellent for tourist who wants to experience the history and culture of korea. I recommend it for nature-loving and people who don't mind walking and listening to lectures. there is a guided tour that are very informative and the place is relaxing.
Palace at its Finest,"My friend and I rushed to Gyeongbokgung Palace to witness the Changing of Guard Ceremony, we were awed with performance despite of the cold weather. Afterwards, we rushed to the nearby store to rent a hanbok-traditional Korean dress. It was a bit expensive but it was worth it. If you visit this place wearing a hanbok, entrance fee is waived. The palace is a beauty to behold. This is the biggest palace among the 5 palaces of Seoul, South Korea. This is the living witness of the history of Korea. The palace offers breathtaking views, perfect for pictorial. If you are a heritage lover, then this place is a must see. Aside from the palace itself, you can witness the changing of guard ceremony observed every morning and visit the National Palace Museum and National Folk Museum within the compound for free. It was lovely experience, it was a dream come true!!"
Good place to visit,Great place to spend and hour or so looking around. Very beautiful in every season even in the rain. Highly recommend spending a day looking at all the palaces in Seoul!
Awesome!,Best palace in Seoul. Really beautiful. The entrance is 3000w. Worth the visit and there are no queues.
To do in seoul,I recommend taking the combo tickets and doing all the palaces in 1 or 2 days it is worth the 10.000 won. Gyeongbukgung is the biggest palace and the most impressive one ^^ enjoy the history of thr joseon dynasty and the museum next to it :) but the palace Doeksugung that l lesser known and down from gyeongbukgung is worth a visit after sundown !!! Only palace that is open and lighted up at night ^^ it is impressive and so pretty !
Main palace,"My sister and I visited Gyeongbokgung, once without a hanbok (entrance fee is 3000krw/person if I'm not mistaken) and again with hanbok (free entry) for the fun of it. Visitors are not allowed to enter any of the buildings which are empty, however are free to walk everywhere. Everything is outdoor... The weather was pretty cold when we were there. The cafe and gift shop was our temporary hideout for snacks and hot tea. There are free English tours available at certain times during the day. We did not join the tour due to the cold weather. The guards change ceremony is also interesting to watch. This was one of the busiest palace we visited during our trip. We spent about 2-3 hours here. "
Beautiful structure,"Beautiful, surrounded by water a classic Asian structure made of carved colourful wood and fine ceiling design and typical old Asian roof tile style. Asian classic."
Must see,"This is the main palace in Seoul, South Korea, from the Joseon period built in 1395. Also known as the Northern palace, v/s the Eastern and Western palaces. The largest and most beautiful one. The National Palace Museum and the National Folk Museum are nearby just outside of the respective gates. Well worth a visit, if one has to understand the history of Korea."
"Expansive Grounds, Fascinating Architecture","The palace is set against the impressive backdrop of Bugaksan Mountain and the grounds offer a great insight into the power and majesty of the Joseon royal court, the most long-lasting dynasty in Korean history. There are English brochures at the ticket stand to aid foreign visitors. I believe there are also guided tours, but we chose the self-guided option and used our brochures to walk the grounds and explore the sprawling compound. Also on-site and free to enter: the Korean National Folk Museum and Korean National Palace Museum."
Dress up in hanbok,"It was zero degrees celsius when we visited but we just had to dress up in hanbok. I think doing so made it more special. It was unbelievably cold but it still fun. I opted not to get dressed in kimono when I visited Japan, this experience makes me want to go back and try the kimono."
A Simple Royal Palace,"The Royal Palace is a must-see attraction if you want to appreciate the life style in the old Korean kingdom. The actual palace is rather large, with a lot of empty spaces. The actual living quarter for the residences are very small. There are simple buildings with several rooms and courtyards. In comparison, I found this Palace more formal than the Japanese. The design is similar the one in Beijing; but in a much much smaller scale."
👍🏻👍🏻,This place is really huge and I was amazed by the structures being preserved up to this time. Witness the changing of guards and a lot at least 1-2hrs when visiting. This is a must visit place in Seoul!! This is totally worth it. 
Worth going with a guide in a workday in sunny weather,"I absolutely recommend you to join the free guided groups (every 1-2 h). As well, I went in a morning of a workday, so no pretty crowded. You can also buy Palace Pass (10 000 W) for 4 palaces, which makes sense as the ticket here is 3 000 W for all (no student discount). My advice: eat well before going, no shops on the territory, and take comfortable shoes and warm clothes as you will be walking 2-3 hours."
Not to be missed ,Wonderful palace showcasing the beauty of simplicity of Korean royal architecture. Visit early in the morning before it gets too crowded. Change of guards at 10am and 2pm worth to watch. Lose yourself among the various pavilions and do not miss the wooden palace at the top north of the estate. 
An absolute must.,"I've been to this palace twice now, once in winter and the other in June and both times were so much fun. Attend the free tours and take your time walking around the grounds. Rent a hannok too!"
Grand Space,The sheer size of this place is awe inspiring. The changing of the guard ceremony was colorful. The free guided tour was informative. A nice way to spend a couple of hours.
Tiny palace with not much to see,"While it’s sort of pretty with what there is, the palace grounds are really small and doesn’t really have much grandiosity to it. If compared to the forbidden palace, it pales greatly in comparison. Most (if not all) of the palace is reconstructed from a fire before being abandoned for a few centuries, so it doesn’t look or feel how an ancient structure would typically be. At the end of the palace, beyond it, there are some weird prison like structures that absolutely destroys the beauty of the mountain as a backdrop to the palace. Entry fee isn’t expensive though, at US$3, so it’s worth a visit if you’re exploring the area. Not really worth a detour."
Very nice place to visit - especially in the winter,No regrets of making a stop at the Gyeongbokgung Palace. This place is huge and has a lot of history. You can spend an easy 2 hours strolling around and for those who love photography- this is a great place to take pictures. 
Classic Korean Site,"The entrance fee is only about 3,000 won but free on holidays, and it is excellent! There are free tours in English, and you can walk the grounds with a group or wander free. It's a beautiful palace and at the center of Seoul. Highly recommend!"
Korean doll,Gyeongbokgung is a beautiful historical place. The most beautiful thing is that everyone can rent a traditional dress and visit it!
Excellent way to see Korean history stunning views,"We enjoyed the experience here. Be aware it is closed on Tuesdays (we found out the hard way) Do be sure to go when they have the mock changing of the guard I believe there is a morning show around 11am and another at 2pm. It is very well maintained with signs in Korean, English, and I believe Chinese also. I recommend allowing at least 1 1/2 hours as it is expansive. You can rent traditional Korean outfits from several places around the palace if you want to do that as well."
Great bit of Korean history,"We visited the Gyeongbokgung Palace while we were in South Korea for the Olympics. It allowed us to soak in the long standing history of the country in a very modern and busy downtown city like Seoul. First thing we noticed without much research into the palace was the size and scope of the area. We initially entered the palace thinking it would be a good hour of exploration, but if you want to take in everything the site has to offer that would likely require 4-6 hours. By the time we left, I clocked about 3.5 miles of walking. The buildings are magnificent. Most are recently built because they have been destroyed so many times over the past 800 years so you won’t be looking at historic monuments per se, but you get the grand scope of the palace as you venture around. We happened to visit right at the end of the four day Korean National holiday so there were a lot of South Koreans taking very traditional pictures with the cultural clothing rented from local shops. We found that extremely interesting and actually allowed us some great pictures of the palace buildings with amazingly garbed locals. The one thing that I would say is definitely take your pictures, but at a certain point the buildings look very similar and the photographs kind of meld together. Therefore don’t be afraid to put the phone/camera down and just experience the history in front of you. The buildings will look too similar in pictures but you will still be in awe of the surroundings that only your eyes will be able to soak in. The winter is very cold and the plant life is all in hibernation. I would love to see what the palace looks like in the spring in full bloom but all in all it was a great visit. "
Korean Experience,"It was a very interesting experience We enjoyed watching the changing of the guard and hearing the history if the palace. We chose to rent Korean dress and walk around which wass fun. I would encourage this as many people chose to take their pictures with us. It is amazing how large this palace is. Unfortunately the weather was cold when we visited but it didn't dampen our experience.If you do go, there are not many places to eat in the area, so eat before you go to it."
another i-SEOUL-u review,Amazing built of palace! A lot of foot exercise but its worth every single step!We walked from our Hotel Metro to the palace via Gwanghwamun. It was a FOC visit for us due to the Seollal (:For early birds: - there is 2 different ceremonies.0940 - there is a rehearsal of changing guards ceremony inside the palace.1000 - Heungnyemun changing of guards ceremony.1100 - Gwanghwamun changing of guards ceremony.
Worth the Visit Only with the 1st Changing Guard Ceremony,It is worth the visit if you go early morning to catch the 1st changing guard ceremony. If not there is not much to see inside just many buildings and they are all the same. 
It was a nice 2-hour tour!,"it is near the Anguk station on the brown line, few hundred meters away! Pro-tip go on a weekend cause it is usually free that time and go early so that you could still take your photos in peace away from thousands of tourists."
Excellent palace,"We able to see the changing of guards it was really a nice experience, it was just too cold for me to wear hanbok but it was really nice having picture in the palance wearing hanbok;) the palace is nicely keept, and clean even comforts rooms;) "
Excellent! Although difficult at times with a stroller,"Well worth a visit!! Lots to see, I could easily spend a full day here! Its often very busy, and there were many school trips on the day that we went. Lots of people were dressed in traditional outfits and ealking around taking pictures too.Worth bearing in mind that it can be a little difficult at times with a stroller. There are ramps up and down most steps but the ground is uneven and rocky in places. My friend was ok wkth her stroller as it had big and solid wheels!"
Historic palace ,"A beautifully restored palace, several lovely temples and some well-kept grounds are the highlights of a visit to Gyeongbokgung. Plan on spending an hour or so wandering through the site and immersing yourself in the 500 year plus history of the Joseon Dynasty.Ps - time your visit to make sure you experience the changing of the guard. It happens several times per day and is worth seeing."
wear your hanbok while visit this palace. a memorable one,"a big palace from the past, must visit spot if you come to seoul.many photo spot inside. a famous tourist spot but not so crowded. try to visit it in 4 different season, you'll find a different feelings."
Perfect,My favorite place in Seoul. It's so rich in culture that I could stay the whole day and still not see and learn enough. A MUST go!!! 
Photogenic location filled with history,"This is an amazing palace and grounds - and way bigger than expected from the outside. You can get some great photos of the spectacular architecture against the cityscape, as well as the visitors in traditional Hanbok dress. I arrived just before the changing of the guard at 2 pm, which you shouldn’t miss. It’s quite a show, with military pomp, drums and uniforms. Kids would probably love it.I took a free Seoul Walking Tour around the palace, which is a great option to get the most out of the experience. There is a lot of history that one might not get without a guide. "
Very interesting,Its free entry inside the palace if you wear the traditional hanbok. Otherwise changing of guards and walking around the palace is free too. Lots of photogenic places. Hanbok rentals are mostly at bukchan hanok area across the street and up. Loads of variety of price and time limit. So ask first before purchasing. Trustworthy enough to keep your coats with them remember to bring along your wallet and phone and camera on a handbag rented by them. 
Korean history lesson,"We were visiting 2018 Olympic Games and stopped fro few days in Seoul. Visiting Gyeongbokgung Palace was highlight of our visit, watching changes of guards, visiting different parts of palace was awesome. Korean history is reach, interesting and memorable."
Historical n mystical,Really enjoyed the walk in the palace ground with my sons. As a fan of Korean movies n dramas it feel surreal to walk around this beautiful place.
a very lovely place,"Well preserved. Full of history. They even offer free tours (chinese, english, korean etc) inside the palace. The people wearing hanbok makes the palace alive."
Life in the Place,To enhance your Korea experience.It is recommended to wear their traditional costume they call Hanbok. It’s amazing to stroll around this well preserve palace. Last time June 2017 the pavilion was renovated but the rest of the area is still accessible.
Joseon feels,Me and my friends rented a hanbok so we can enter for free also the scenery feels like you're in a different world like those you watch in korean dramas its really an amazing experience .
History well preserved ,Lovely area with very reasonable price entrance prices' easy to navigate even for persons that have difficulties to walk' the photo ops all around are unique nor too be missed' and the place is able to maintain its beauty even with thousands of tourist inside its ground because of its sheer size' 
"If you like Korean movies / drama (especially movies about ancient Korea), this is a good place to visit","You can dress up in hanbok (especially the costumes for king / queen, etc). Lot of photo opp, but not really much to look at. Vast space and not really much inside. It's interesting how international Korea has become.. lots of tourists from all over."
How to get there and more.,"It's also called The Northern Palace or The Royal Palace and it's the biggest of the five palaces in Seoul. In summer, it is open from 9 a.m. until 6:30 p.m. and closes on Tuesdays. You will need at least half a day to see it completely and good walking shoes which you can take off easily. I strongly recommend checking the official website in English and buying an Integrated Ticket that will allow you to save some money and to visit four palaces and a shrine. The ticket is worth 10,000 won. You can book it online and pay for it when you go into one of the palaces. In order to get there, the best way is to go to Gyeongbokgung Station (Seoul Subway Line 3) and Exit 5 or go to Anguk Station (Seoul Subway Line 3) and Exit 1. You can also take buses No. 1020, 7025,109, 171, 172, 601 or 606 and get off at Gyeongbokgung Palace Bus StopIf you want to visit this palace with a tour, there are three tours in English every day. We decided to do it on our own at our own pace but we went on tours in other palaces and the guides are usually great and very professional.The most beautiful part was a temple in the middle of a lake.You can see the pictures on my blog.You will see people dressed in beautiful traditional Korean clothes called Hanbok. We mainly saw young groups of friends and couples. All five palaces waive admission fees for visitors wearing hanbok and there are shops that rent them. Mind you, we never saw a foreigner wearing a Hanbok.There was a small café in the palace and we had to sit there to have a drink and eat something because we were exhausted.All in all, this palace is a must and no matter how tired you end up it's totally worth it."
The unique combinations of Seoul ,"This place is one of the many reasons why many people visit Seoul. The old architectural surrounded by the most technology building makes most unique combinations. It makes you almost feel the revolutionary. The palace itself contains many historical secret which we can only guess through the presence. Not to mention the “rental hanbok” nearby which you can turn yourself into a historical as well. People visit here all year round, even in the winter. Don’t worry about the subway line, it’s everywhere and it’s pretty easy to get there cheaply. It’s 2 in 1 because there’s also a museum. Very recommend!"
Pretty place to take pictures,"You can reach this palace by using the subway train, the Gyeongbokgung station. Once you arrived, it is recommended to rent a Hanbok dress, because your picture will look more classic. Haha. You can walk about 300 meters to the left of this palace entrance to go to the Hanbok rental shop. This palace was a nice place to take a lot of pictures."
"Fun for a while, but not much to do but look","It's a great cheap little thing you can do for an hour or two. I think it was 3,000 Won or something like that. Very well preserved and very beautiful, but unless you time your visit right with the tour or any shows, it's hard to stay entertained for so long. The museum next door is fantastic, though. All in all, if you're visiting Seoul it's definitely a place to see."
Worth visiting even if you've been to Forbidden Palace,"It's definitely not as big as the Forbidden Palace in Beijing; however, it's still worth a visit. The layout is similar with gates and buildings where the Royalties would enjoy entertainment, and such. It's great to see the urban city behind the Palace and admission included a visit to the Folk Museum, which was worth a stopover to see their exhibitions. Great place to take photos if you decide to borrow and wear a hanbok."
Beautiful,"Just like Changdeokgung Palace, Gyeongbokgung Palace is grand, beautiful and peaceful. Well preserved. You can also catch the changing of the guard if you time your visit right. Worth a visit."
I always love walking around in this palace,"Start pestering the guards on duty. Their traditional silk garbs are photogenic. The palace grounds are beautiful. This time, it snowed. It was beautiful. A must do in Seoul. "
Worth a look,"We came here during Feb when the Olympics were in South Korea. We came here on our first morning. It was a cool look around, and the guard ceremony was worth watching. "
Go for the Guards changing,"This is probably the ""best"" palace to look at. But beware that you're only looking at the outside of a lot of buildings that to the untrained eye look very similar to one another. It's not like visiting Versailles or a UK palace where you get to walk around inside and see how people really lived. That said, it's a slice of history, you can admire the architecture and appreciate the sheer scale of the royal residence. The changing of the guard ceremony is well worth watching - the highlight of my visit "
Beautiful,"Was the first royal palace built in the Joseon Dynasty. Is the largets of the 5 palaces remaining in Seoul. You have to pay around 3,000 Wons per Adult and foreigners under 18 years old can enter for free. This palace is close on Tuesdays. Changing of the Royal Guard Ceremony twice daily. Is a beautiful and incredible place to visit, the colors are incredible you can learn a lot of this beautiful culture and country. Every time i go to seoul i love to visit it."
Amazing place,No one can ever imagine how the previous century citizen build this amazing palace. It’s beautiful and wonderful palace. Even me myself would love to stay here for lifetime. Big playground for a family. Nothing can compared to korean cultures . It was amazing. Highly recommend for tourists to visit. 
So huge,"Look, if y’all want to came here it better be on fall- early winter.The palace was huuuugee and so instagram-able. The guard swith show was one to watch!"
Transported to the past,"Went to visit the Palace in February on a very cold (-15C) and windy day. It's a beautiful place that can easily transport you back to the past, especially if you have many people wearing the traditional costumes. Followed the free English tour and that made the place more interesting. What's left is 10% of the original palace and it's also been rebuilt. Recommended to visit this palace to get a feel of the past vs the modern Korea."
OMG magnificent palace,"If you like to take pictures then you visit this palace as you can wear traditional dress then you enter every where free, their is show (guard changing shift) last move 14:00 and if u need English guide u can find after 13:30 "
Interesting ,The grounds and gardens of the palace are interesting to walk through especially when it’s not busy as you feel transported back to a different age. It’s a relatively cheap attraction to go to ( ₩4000) which includes the main palace and the gardens. Aldo it’s easily accessible by metro.
A standard on the tour path,Every time someone wanted me to play tour guide in Seoul I took them to the palace. It’s big and there’s a great museum inside it. It’s good for a walk or a rest during the summer. I’ve taken a nap there after reading a nice book. It’s peaceful and affordable. Definitely a lot to look at and a lot of history going on. Not a 5 because I’m comparing it to the forbidden city in my mind. This is wayyyyy smaller and not a full day activity. Still a great part of an itinerary. Don’t miss it 
Best palace in South Korea,Never forget this place as my travel experience because there are many spot of photoshoot and also many palace to visit. Note : you don't have to pay if you're using hanbok. And you can find the rental of hanbok near that area (choose wisely there are many option of rental)
Good Example of Korean Architecture,Covered in snow when I went in late January. Nice architecture with a good bit of history. Beautiful in winter.
History,History and culture tour. Beautiful place for picture taking and dress up in Korean traditional costume.
Exploring Korea 2018,"Great experience to visit this lovely Palace in the winter. With temperatures between -10 and -15 degrees C we did a tour to the Secret Garden and found it interesting, beautiful and freezing. Jay, our guide, did and excellent job in explaining the ways of the people in the earlier years. I would highly recommend this tour with all its well maintained structures."
The Palace,"I suggest you take the guided tour of the grounds to get the real feel of what transpired so many years ago. Take note of the detail that went into the buildings centuries ago. The guards are like they were when the Palace was lived in, I don't even think they blink"
awesome free tour by middle school students and great view,"if you take the subway directly to gyeongbokgung palace stop, near the exit to the palace, we were fortunate to meet a group of middle school students who are part of a cultural society offering free tours in English to foreigners. We gladly accepted their offer and had an awesome tour with great explanation! On top of the reasonably priced entrance tickets, the tour was a cherry on top!"
Seoulful even in winter,"Tickets were considerably cheap for adults as it only costs 3000 krw entry.We went pretty early, arriving at 9.50am. Luckily for us, we were just in time to spectate a guard changing ceremony at the front gate. My sister was wondering if the guards had real or drawn on mustache. Who knows? We had a lot of fun wandering through the castle grounds making lots of guesses to what each building was for. If you want, you could request for an english speaking tour guide at the front. Me and my sister managed to listen in to other's english speaking tour guides, but it was all more fun when we had to guess. A lovely place to wander in and spend a good 1-2 hours with lots of picturefriendly spots. I imagine it would've been more lovely in spring as a lot of the trees and flower shrubs were quite bare at the moment due to the not-forgiving weather. We would've hired a hanbok, however it was way too cold for us to bare."
Came to this place two times,I went to Gyeongbokgung in 2014 with my friends and in 2017. This place is a place I always back to. They have a ceremony every certain hours and I am lucky to always witness it whenever I come.
Magnificent ,Super beautiful and huge. I would recommend visitors to wear a traditional hanbok (rental is available around this area!) to go to the palace as the entrance fee will be free and you'll be able to feel like one of the people living in the joseon dynasty! a really good place to visit especially if you're interested in Korea's history. :)
Very pretty,"Though there’re many people, the palace is big enough to wander around on your own and have good pictures. There’s a hanbok shop nearby, from which you can rent beautiful handbok and access the palace for free (I guess they included that in the rental fee). Very nice experience "
Beautiful,Make sure your rent the hanbok costumes from the shops outside the palace before visiting there. Dont miss the Changing Guards event.
Nice palace!,If you lke to visit palaces. It was a great palace to visit. Obe of the most visited palace in Seoul.
Beautiful places,"this places is so beautiful, i was there when in winter season. i feel freeze of course, but i feel so comfort here so many places to taken a photos. I’m happy being here"
the icon,"best location to take photos, every corner were good for taking photos. this grand palace was well taken care of."
Amazing,Our tour guide Harry shared the every detail of the historical background of this palace. The architectural structure is truly amazing because every detail has its own meaning.
"Beautiful palace, frozen lake, need to spend 3 hours or more","This palace is one of our favorite place. We visited this place around 03.00 p.m, which is a warmer time in winter. We only had 2 hours to look around. The children felt amazed seeing Gyeonghoeru Pavilion and the frozen lake. It was very beautiful. There were a folk museum and children's folk museum inside this palace. We suggest you to visit those museums. "
King Palace,"This place is a korea historic place. Nice place to walk around and enjoy the scenery, there are museums too inside the palace area. You can join free english/korea tour managed by the gyeongbokgung staff. Try to find a good spot far inside to get good photos."
Vast,"While it is beautiful, it is also extremely expansive. I didn't join and tour and perhaps I should have because about an hour into the palace I was turned around wandering through different alleys. It was really hot that day and there really isn't any refereshment options inside so after a few hours of looking around, I did feel a little like a rat trapped in a maze.Worth going but wear really good shoes and bring plenty of water."
Big palace,We watched the guards changing ceremony at the main square before proceeding into the palace. Most of the rooms were not accessible so we can only view from the outside. Big place to cover and nice scenery while walking around the different parts of the palace. My children enjoyed the children's museum in the palace.
Beautiful elegant palace!,"This place was gorgeous. The color and detail in the pillars and palace were exquisite. It was super cold when we got here as snow was everywhere. However we were delighted to see the Kingsguard ceremony was EPICCCC. Loved the way they dressed up in ceremonial clothing from back then as well as the moustaches too. The band was stellar and loved all the pretty colors. The gong player was awesome too. Lots of walking required and I didnt have the energy to walk everywhere. There is a cafe where you can purchase a hot chocolate which we did right away. A few girls came dressed in Hanboks and they looked incredible. Probably something we should have done as we dressed in them after, but way too cold at the time. Best time to go is at 9AM as NO one is there, makes for taking better photos."
Tour,Very near the President' s house. Beautiful landscaping and the changing of the guards is something to see
A great trip,Visiting this palace was such an unique and special experience! My daughter and I had a great time while we were there.
Beautiful Palace!,"Our tour guide from Here Travel Korea brought us here to visit the palace and learn more about the Korean history. It was huge and indeed, an amazing sight during the winter. Our tour guide was very knowledgeable and shared with us the history of the palace, the building structures, etc."
Huge Palace!,This place is huge! My feet got tired just walking around this place and didnt have the energy to go to another palace. There are shops nearby where you can rent hanbok so better to rentone before going around to take photos :)
Very nice place,"Went to this Gyeongbokgung Palace, but too many people and couldnt find any clear instruction on the usage of the traditional costume. But still, this palace is attractive!"
A Huge and Beautiful Korean Palace,"One of the many Palaces than can be seen in South Korea. It is a long walk but a lot to see. It is better appreciated if you have a Tour Guide to understand the importance and history of every architectures inside this huge Palace. There's no entrance fee. If you're a kdrama fan, you might remember some historical period dramas that depicts the Korean's Joseon dynasty. Another attraction is the changing of royal guards ceremony located in one of the gates (Gwanghwamun gate). You can see a lot of tourists and locals wearing traditional clothing (Hanbok) and you can wear one too (but with a corresponding fee) to add to the vibe. It is so crowded when we visited-an hour before noon."
Very historical,The palace is huge and not at all stroller friendly.There are lots of stairs not suitable for strollers. Can get very crowded. We did the English guided tour which provided us some good insight. There were guards standing at the main gate and everyone was clicking photos with them. Very well connected to the subway.
Huge palace!,Huge palace with lots of tourists. Make sure you check out the changing of guard times. Beautiful autumn atmosphere but had few restoration works while we were there.
Historic and Beautiful,"A nice place to spend an hour or two wandering the grounds. Walking tours in multiple languages are conducted every 2-3 hours or so. There is lots of history to be learned here, and many beautiful photo opportunities!"
Visit this palace for a relaxing walk,"This palace is the biggest among the other 5 palaces in Seoul. It is huge and grand and a great way to spend a relaxing morning. The palace buildings are beautifully restored and its granduer really impressed me. You can easily spend 4 hours just looking at every nook and cranny. Do allocate some time to watch the changing of guards at the main Gwanghwamun gate. Do not rush through this attraction as you sit down at the many seats provided to just watch the relaxing scenery.National Folk Museum of Korea is also situated in the Palace's ground. I was able to enter the museum FOC with the Palace ticket.With such a big ground to cover and a museum to visit, do wear comfortable walking shoes, bring drinking water and your camera. I believe you will enjoy your visit as much as I did."
English tour,Great to visit if you do the guided tour. It is a large compound and you do not get as much out of it walking around on your own without the guide.
A very relaxing sight,"Very large and relaxing area, good combination of nature and architecture, and very peaceful for a long walk.There's a lot to see and also to walk, you can start at one point and see the next ones just after each other like a chain. Make sure to be there on time not to miss the ceremony of guard changing (I think every 30 minutes or so)..Enjoy the walk there and peace and the view of the mountains."
Historical Palace within Seoul,"One of the main palaces of Seoul, the grounds are huge while the palace itself is beautiful. Expect large crowds especially during the guard change ceremony."
Must visit!,Excellent must-visit place especially for first timers in Seoul. Helps if you have a Guide - learn much more Korea’s history. 
Nice view,This place is amazing and is a good place for us to understand on Korea culture. Wearing hanbok is free entrance! It was a great experience wearing hanbok walk around and snap photo around the Gyeongbokgung Place.
a restoring palace,"this palace is still under restoration. Most buildings are not allowed to entry so you can only see outside of the building, which is a disappointment. "
Palaces,Tho palaces have common colours and shapes it gave me a glimpse of the old setting Korean telenovela i am watching. 
"Reserve the entry to palace, before going there!","As I walked all palace area form east side, not front gate, this was the last thing what I saw in that territory. Around palace is big water bucket, full with fish and in that square traditional music is playing. Palace was beautiful BUT I was upset when I wanted to walk in there (it is on like a island), but it was written I needed to make a reservation to go there 24 hours before. Me as tourist, who doesn't normally plan where I will go, don't like it. And it is one of the biggest palaces, so I am mad that I was not able to see it closely while I where in Seoul."
Nice place with free tours),"Must visit spot! Interesting and beautiful. But better in Summer or the beginning of the autmn. Free tours provided, so it makes it even better :) In English, Chinese. "
Great place,Great visit. Many tourists can be seen wearing traditional Korean attire.Mountains at its back look awesome. Like Buckingham Palace guard changing ceremony this palace also offers something similar which is wonderful. available on.It was very cold but we had fun watching the changing of the guards. Walk around and get lost wondering the palace. We had a temporary expo that was worth going.
Super Museum,Beautifully restored buildings and it's an oasis of calm in this mega city.There is so much to see.
Excellent travel to the past experience of Korea.,"I enjoyed our tour of this palace. The Korean tour guide is English speaking and has an excellent knowledge of the history and culture of Korea. We entered here wearing a Hanbok and our entrance is free because of it. Some tourist is taking photos with us too. The parade is a must to watch, check the schedule and wait for it. If you're visiting during summer or autumn don't forget to bring umbrella or sunscreen."
Very educatiobal,"Lovely stroll around palace grounds. Great insight on the royal family's lives, the palace architecture... so much to learn."
Interesting palace to visit,"The biggest palace in Seoul, take the morning to wander around, watch the changing of the guard ceremony, see the locals in traditional dress enjoying themselves. "
A landmark of Korean Culture,"Well, when our family went to Seoul, we visited Gyeongbukgong Palace first. We took the train from Myeongdong Station and got off at Gyeongbukgong Station, then took Exit 5 where it leads you to the palace' left side. You'll know you're there when you reach The National Folk Museum of Korea next to it. The palace entrance was big and had guards on it, you can take photos of them, they wont hurt you. The ticket booth should be at the side of the gate. After going inside the palace gate, i was impressed by the beautiful architecture especially when you reach the main palace. Prior to the main palace you'll be crossing a bridge where the scenery is good for taking photos. The main palace is big enough that even if from afar, you can clearly see the sharp details of Korean Traditional Architecture. Inside, you can see a sacred place with murals on the panels and ceiling. At the right side of the main palace there is also a garden where you can enjoy the scenery of the garden, At the back of the palace is the village, where there are houses and crafts. Although i wasnt intrested in that part compared to the main palace.Overall, i think the Gyeongbukgong palace tour would take you 2 hours to explore and take photos. There is no need to spend half a day there. Also, for those renting a hanbok, there is a rental shop outside the palace (few blocks outisde at the station) or inside the palace itself. The staff and guides were accomdating to tourists. Gyeongbukgong Palace is actually a must see site if you're planning to visit Seoul."
amazing,"i am so amazed of the korean people on how they preserved gyeongbukgung palace. it is really beautiful and a place where tourist must not fail to visit. i would like to try the costume but because of so much cold, i will just try next time. "
Gyeongbokgung Palace ," I visited Gyeongbokgung palace with my family (kids between 7-14) and it was a lot of fun. The entry was very reasonable as it was 9,500 won for 5 tickets. The grounds are very large and plan to stay for 2 or so hours to wander around if you’re not part of a tour. Additionally the palace museum is on the west side of the grounds and is free of charge as well as the Seoul Metro exit comes directly into the palace grounds. I highly recommend to go to see the history of Korea. "
Gyeongbokgung,I entered from the Folk village entrance which caused me to miss a half of the park. Enter from the main entrance ask for the information booth set up to use their free guided tour which goes out every 1.5 hours. They will take you to all the main spots you need to go to. They also have 2 different types of the changing of the guards show. It was fantastic 
History in center of city!!,"Visited here during the month of September 2017. Its a must see palace if you are visiting Seoul. It's quite a big palace and will take you around 2 hrs to cover it fully. The palace has an entry fee of 3000 Korean won. There is also another ticket which cover 5 palaces and valod for a month I guess, buying that ticket will get you a good deal if you are planning to visit all palaces.Also the guards changing ceremony is the one which everyone looks forward for.As I remember it starts at 2. So be there in time to witnesses it.After the ceremony you can also get pictures clicked besides the guards.Also around the palace you will find shop's were you can rent the traditional Korean attire and visit the palace in that attire."
Must see- consider Hanbok and Joseon scholar costume rental for pix,"We enjoyed visiting this with our tour guide- he was able to get us to the best place to view the changing of the guard, and also helping to find a close place to rent Hanbok and Joseon-era clothing for taking pictures at the Palace during changing of the guard. We usually are not the type to do cosplay but this was actually a really fun way to go around the palace grounds. If you do rent costumes, admission is free into the palace grounds. (was only able to convince one of our teenage daughters to dress up though...)"
Good seoul attractions,"One of the top Seoul attractions. Very vast, a lot to learn about Seoul history. Prepare to walk a lot inside."
Great atmosphere,"The front yard area is nice and open, it's lovely to walk around the whole palace and see the different parts of it.It was quite cold when I went in the hanbok but it makes for a picturesque area for sure.It is worth a visit especially because there's so much more to see in the area."
nice experience,I like it place amazing lots of history for King I hope to come again to visit palace really is amazing I feel in movie 
Too big area,If u want to visit there search about hours about ceremony changing of security. When i was there it happened at 11 o clock. And last about 30 mins.
Perfect for history buffs ,The palace is hugeee. We forgot to take the flyers at the information counter making it hard to understand the while history behind it. U can also rent a hanbok and take picture here. We didnt do it because it was below 0 degrees when we went. I had fun admiring the architecture of the palace too. 
Wear hanbok at Gyeongbukgung,"I always visit Gyeongbukgung every time I go to Korea. This time, my friends and I decided to rent hanbok (Korean traditional attire) at Hanboknam before going to the palace for a royal entrance. We really enjoyed walking from Hanboknam to the palace because it was autumn then. "
Nice place to visit in Seoul,"The day I visited the palace was -15 degree so I didn’t really taking my time to stroll around as I would do to other sightseeings, but I really love the blue sky on the cold days. It is a beautiful place and you can go to the National Folk Museum Korea without charge but when you re-enter the palace, remember to show the ticket you purchased from the main gate of the palace. There are free English tours offered at the sign on the right after you enter the ticketed gate. I didn’t join the tour since I was at the palace at 12:30pm and the next English tour is at 1:30pm. "
wonderful history,A great place to visit full of history and the beautiful buildings and gardens takes you back 600 years. The guards guarding the palace gates were amazing. just stands so still.
Not much to see,There is really not much to see there. Visitors are not allowed to enter the palaces. People just walk the halls and take photos. 3000 W entrance feeline 3 (orange line) - Gyeongbokgung St - exit 5 
Amazing palace! ,Well maintained palace. Only 3000 won per entry! You can always buy the integrated tickets so that you can enter 3 palaces and 1 shrines with one price! 
Good Place to Visit,In all our Asian tours we make it a point to visit temples and palaces to learn about the history and culture of the country we are visiting. Gyeongbukgung Palace being the residence of the last King in the last Korean Dynasty was a must visit for us. It was a huge place which we would not have appreciated if not for the free guided tour in English. The guides were waiting off Exit 5 of Gyeongbukgung Station and would offer visitors a free English tour. Yes...free! Our guide spoke eloquently in English and was very knowledgeable in history of the palace and explained to us intricate details of its construction to both keep the king and his family comfortable as well as protected from threats. The walking tour was about an hour. Oh don’t forget to check out the changing of the guards at the palace main entrance. 
It would be better if you visit with tour guide,"Went during winter with temperature -7Celcius, freezing cold! We managed to get a volunteer tour guide during the visit of this historical place, takes about 2 hrs. Without tour guide, I don't think I will stay this place more than a hour. Every design or architecture has it own fengshui and symbolization. Quite an interesting place for those who would like to understand more about Korea's history"
Changing of the Guard,"If you're visiting on a budget and not wanting to pay to enter the inner areas of the palace, then try to come by right around the changing of the guard, which happens at 10AM and then at 1PM (the morning guard change is less crowded). It's free to watch the ceremony, which takes about 10-15 minutes. You can then take a picture with the guards who stand at the front."
A must see in South Korea!,"This past summer I took a trip to South Korea with the Korean Ties program. This was my first trip to Asia. Visiting Gyeongbokgung Palace was one of the first places we visited. I was blown away by how beautiful the buildings were and the amazing craftsmanship. This place was very clean and had lots of great sights. The space is very open with lots of area to roam and take pictures. This is a must see if you are in Seoul, South Korea."
Seoul Classic,"A very nice palace that will bring you right back into the olden days era. If you wish to rent hambok,they do not offer it at the palace. You have to head to the shops outside the palace to rent it. It is very easy to find. Overall a very nice palace. "
Take the free tour,We arrived to the palace as the free tour was about to take place. The tour goes for around an hr to an hour and a half. The tour guide was very well knowledgeable and lead the tour in an interesting way. I was never once felt bored or disinterested. The palace is a beautiful place with lots of photo opportunities if you decide to dress up. The tour take you to the main areas but there a plenty of other area to explore. 
Take your time to explore this place,"While the entrance seems packed because everyone was waiting for the changing service of the guards, the inner compound wasn't that crowded. There are a few lakes in the palace however one of it was under renovation during our visit. The compound of the palace is huge and we took our own time to take photographs. People who dress up in traditional hanbok could enter free of charge. Nice and quiet place. "
Photo opportunity,Very clean and spacious with minimal queue. Managed to catch e change of guards and there is english tours as well but we were ok to wander on our own amd explore. Trend to rent a traditional costume and walk around taking pics. Worth a visit and its free!
An enjoyable tour,"Although the palace is huge, there are actually limited opportunity to view the interior of the building. Having said that, those that we were able to, had simple open structure within the building, unlike the Chinese or Japanese palaces. Nevertheless, appreciate its culture for what it is. Watch the change of guards and join the free guided tours (check out the timing)"
A top place to visit in Seoul,"Large historic palace and garden with multiple buildings, gardens, artificial lake, etc. Plan 3-4 hours to visit the place. The royal changing of the guard ceremony is held at the main gate hourly from 10:00 to 15:00 and is well worth visiting. Plan your timing so as to be at the main gate on the top of the hour either at the beginning or end or your visit. We visited on a beautiful day in the fall with some of the trees in autumn colors and a nice reflection of the Gyeonghoeru pavilion in the water. At the exit from the subway, underneath the National Palace Museum of Korea, is the modern small museum shop and good-sized café Gogungddurak where you can have a simple good meal for lunch."
History and culture,Amazing place and lots to see.The guard ceremony is not to be missed at the gate followed by the free tour. Guide was knowledgeable and interacted with the group to make the hour plus walking interactive and interesting.Station right at the front of the park makes getting there and back again easy.There early January and was a fresh minus 4 outside plus a bit of cooling wind. Rug up with some good warm clothes for the hour or so of walking the grounds.Well worth a few hours to go and see.
Beautiful Park,"Second time coming here still beautiful as always. Amazing palaces with lots of history. The lake was under renovation though so that was a miss. In general, a must go if you come to Seoul."
Palace,"A little sparse on a cold snowy day. Tour guides on hand to assist, but not a massive amount to see. Should be combined with other local museums/attractions. "
Well preserved,The palace is well preserved but i guess that's the reason why visitors are not allowed to enter. the entrance fee is cheap and you are required to join their in-house tour depending on the language of your preference.
Interesting history,Very beautiful palaces but can require A LOT of walking. Place is suitable for families with kids. Very beautiful if you visit in Winter and Autumn. 
A good cultural tour!,"We visited the Palace on 16 Dec and it was freezing though the sun was shining brightly. Before we arrive at the Palace, we were greeted by 2 student volunteers who brought us to purchase our tickets and showed us around the palace and explained the history of the Palace to us. The free tour was awesome and educational!"
Historical sight,"Enjoy the palace on snowy days, I think it is more beautiful that way. Atleast what my family & I did! Only 4- because there is not much to see. When you are inside there may be a second museum which holds different event for different seasons. There you have to pay aswell, nothing is free in this world my sons. "
Take a free tour to better understand the history of this palace,We enjoyed a free (English language) tour of the Palace and it did help explain many of the significances that merely viewing on ones own does not enable
New Year Changing of the Guard,"Got to witness the “changing of the guard”. Although more theatrical than a Military Parade and Review I’ve seen in other countries, it looks more traditional."
Worth the visit!,"Brought my family with a total of 7 adults and 1 toddler. The Palace was crowded and it was a great place to take pictures. If you were to visit this place during winter. Be prepared that it will be rather cold in the Palace. To get a free entry to the Palace, you can rent a Hanok during your entry to the premise. Being there, twice. "
A Must-Visit Seoul Highlight,"I've been here three times in three different seasons. It is stunning and informative, and I always recommend it. However, it is particularly lovely in autumn. :)"
A Fulfilling Day Trip,"Do plan for a full day trip if you can afford the time. It's easy to go there by subway. Plan your arrival time to catch the Guards Mounting ceremony at about 10 am. If you are early, you can watch their rehearsal too. You can consider buying their all places entrance tickets at only KRW10000. That entitles you to visit 3 other palaces/shrine. You may spend more time in the palace tour if you like to take beautiful pictures. Plenty of nice photo locations especially if you are couples! Do have a good breakfast before going in as there's no food/ drinks available. You should not miss the free English speaking guide tour which can last about an hour plus. Lastly, you will probably enjoy the free museum tour which is located adjacent to the palace. A good tour may take up to more than 2 hours. Overall it's a very fulfilling educational tour for the family."
Short walk from the hotel,"Very convenient to the hotel we were at, it was new year's day and very popular for the traditional dress since it was a culture day, which is the last weekend of every month. The only thing that sucked was the museum was closed, other than that, it was totally worth the wall. It is a bit new in some aspects, but really considering the damages to it during the war, I would hope they had repaired and repainted certain areas, it isn't a war memorial after all."
Watch the change of the guard,"This is a special place for Koreans. During the Japanese occupation the palace was destroyed and a huge Japanese administration building was erected by the Japanese instead. I saw this some 20 years ago. Now the Japanese building which also hosted a big museum was torne down by the Koreans and the Palace reconstructed. More reconstruction is planned. Koreans are proud about their history. So the change of the guard, all in traditional clothes , is quite impressive. Many Korean women visitors show up in their traditional dresses, the Hanbok, which stems from the time of the Korean empire."
The main palace in Seoul,The palace is the biggest palace in Seoul. A must visit while in Seoul. Make sure to check the gaurd changing ceremony at 10am.
History of the Joseon Dynasty life style ,"What a pleasant visit! Let me just start saying how nice Seoul and it's people are. As a solo tourist I had to ask for assistance every now and then. About Gyeongbokgung, it is a lovely palace full of history of the Joseon Dynasty. I was approached by a high school tour guide who offered me her services as a guide of the Gyeongbokgung palace as an opportunity for her to speak English. She showed me the palace grounds, explained about life during the dynasty. Interesting to think how the empress life was lonely and how she would never leave the palace again, even after the wasn't the empress anymore. The palace is beautiful in its simplicity. Totally worth a visit."
Beautiful-K Drama fans will love this palace,"Stunning, amazing and very accessible. Handbook rental adds to the experience. $3.00 entrance fee and $10.00 if want to dress up and pretend you are in the Joseon era. "
On list of must sees in Seoul ,"Reminds you of the Forbidden City in Beijing, but much smaller in scale, but nice to see nevertheless.Colourful change of Guard ceremony every hour.Try to catch the English free guided tour 2 or 3 times Daily.Entry to palace is free on last Wednesday of the month."
Nice stroll through the palace park,"This is mainly an outdoor experience rather than a museum and we enjoyed discovering the palace buildings and old architecture. Luckily there weren't too many tourists in December, but a couple of buildings were closed for renovation as well. We managed to enter only one building, where you had to take of your shoes to visit 2-3 rooms. Explanations in English were limited though, translations were mainly in Chinese."
History,Nice to visit to have general view of Korea history. But nothing much to appreciate. However recommender 
Beautiful piece of history,"Toured the palace on a very hot day. If travelling during July - August, Seoul gets very hot. Beautiful history, lovely palace."
A step into history ,Such an amazing tourist attraction right in the center of Seoul. An awesome place to spend the afternoon. 
A Must-See while in Seoul,"Gyeongbokgung Palace is a must-see while in Seoul. The changing of the guard is beautiful to watch, and walk around the grounds, which is huge. If you are 65 or older, admission is free, just bring proof (passport). Admission is inexpensive anyway ($3 USD if I remember correctly)."
BIG palace indeed,My daughter was awestruck on how a palace can be soo grand and soo big.. that was when she initially stepped foot on it after about 45 minutes of walking though. she said when will this end? ha! soo there you go.I as an adult was up for it but with teenagers you gotta whack the history of the place into thier heads.
Charming beautiful palace,"If you enjoy learning or just experiencing some of the history of South Korea, then Gyeongbokgung Palace is a beautiful place to take a trip to, especially since it's not too hard to get to and reasonably priced! There's a lot of rooms and traditional buildings to see and they're all maintained well. Great location to take photos and definitely try and dress up in the hanbok if you get the chance!"
Beautiful palace with traditional architecture ,It is a beautiful huge palace which has a traditional architecture. Mountains at its back look awesome. Like Buckingham Palace guard changing ceremony this palace also offers something similar which is wonderful.Many tourists can be seen wearing traditional Korean attire which is available on rent It’s a must visit attraction if you are in Korea.
Beautiful palacw,"It was very cold but we had fun watching the changing of the guards. And if you manage to catch that, after the ceremony, you can try on the guard costumes for free at a little hut on the left hand side after passing the entrance. My son had fun wearing it and taking photos around the palace (near the hut).Beautiful grounds but big! Walk further in and venture around to quieter areas where you can get lovely photographs."
The palace in Seoul,Great visit. The guard change is a must see. Walk around and get lost wondering the palace. We had a temporary expo that was worth going. 
Must-visit when in Seoul,"You'll always see this palace featured in travel blogs because it's the real deal Korean royal palace~ the biggest one, i think. There is a scheduled changing of the guards that you should not miss to have a full experience.. It's just like the royal guard changing ceremony in Buckingham Palace - but more colorful with the bright costumes of Korean officials! Very much accessible via train or bus, but get ready to walk and walk to see its beauty. The pavilion there is the one featured in the drama Rooftop Prince which made me more excited to see it. Just 3000yen for the entrance and they have hourly walking tours if you'd like to join. Also, the entrance is free if you're wearing a hanbok! Such a treat to see all the people wearing them while inside a historical place~"
A commanding oasis,"A very big place, which had 7700 rooms I read, not as big as the much bigger Forbidden City in Beijing and its notional 9999 and a half rooms, but similar in impact. A sense of command to the buildings and courtyards but also tranquility"
Good to visit,The palace is in Korea traditional architecture and is well maintained. There is a museum in the complex where you can get useful information about local life.
Nice attraction and photo time~,"This is the nice place to visit and we had a great memory by wearing hanbok to enter the palace. There is free admission by wearing hanbok into palace.Unfortunately, this time missed to watch the guard changing ceremony, will back here again someday later."
Gyeongbokgung palace,"I went to gyeongbokgung palace,the scenery is so pretty. Outside view is modern but when you come inside the palace is like you go to another world. Specially if you wear hanbok."
A beautiful palace,A great place to visit and they offer free tours in English. It's beautiful and a great way to learn about Korean history. The changing of the guard is also very interesting. Although the tour was a bit too long for my 5 year old. If you go in winter dress warmly. 
Not my fav,"Although there are many tourist, the palace grounds are large enough for everyone to walk around in. I didn't find the palace very interesting, but i did enjoy the changing of the guards ceremony."
Beautiful Palace!,It was a beautiful palace. A very huge compound and you'll keep walking and walking into the palace with many sub-buildings. Very unique design. Manage to watch the marching during the evening. There were huge crowd visiting the palace. It was our first stop of visit when we were in Seoul. Very convenient to walk from the subway Line 2.
"Extensive grounds, realistically maintained","Spent most of the day exploring the palace grounds, which is every large and is complemented very aptly with related, free museums. The palace buildings are well maintained, but not over the roof ie they show signs of natural aging ie realistically illustrated There are also free “change of guards” and free guided tours. Check the website for detailed timing. A must go if you are on vacation in Seoul!"
Best palace,"Had a wonderful tour! It's my fifth visit since I came here so many years ago. It's amazing to tour solo or with a friend and all seasons, too. I recommend it to everyone. Even if a few places are being renovated, go see it. Pictures don't give it justice."
Beautiful night view in the palace,"Absolutely it is legit to go there during daytime, but also you must not miss night view in the palace.For Korean, I recommend you to reserve ticket through internet!but if you are foreigners or one of your friend is a foreigner, you can buy ticket up to 4 tickets with the foreign friend!As I remember, the ticket costs around $2-3 dollars, which is not a lotAt nominated time, there are some traditional musical shows in the place near to entrance, so it will be enjoyable as well!I recommend you guys to visit the palace during daytime (especially at super early morning, around opening time, which is not crowded at all!) as well as during night!However I heard that this night view is run only in specific duration!so before I visit, check it!"
Huge palace & a must visit if you only have one palace to see!,"We went there on our 3rd day in Seoul. The palace was very huge. There were not as many people as I would have expected since it's coming to Winter season but then you can still see lots of people there. Great place to get to know the history of South Korea. If you want to see the Guard Changing, please be there before 10.00 am as we missed it on that day. Just managed to take pic with the guards. If you plan to visit the palace & few other attractions, you might as well buy the Discover Seoul Pass. A must visit place if you just want to see one palace in Seoul ^_^"
Hanbok experience,Our group opted to rent a Hanbok for 4 hours via KLOOK and the best place to go is no other than the Grand Palace itself: Gyeongbokgung Palace.Tip: If you enter the palace wearing hanbok - entrance fee is free!We explored the palace under 0 degrees while wearing our chosen Hanbok (Heat tech underneath ) -- it really fit the place and our pics turned out to be awesome!
Beautiful in Autumn,Bought as a half day tour. The changing of the guard was totally worth it. Get there early if you want the best seat. The palace is large and the foliage around the palace is gorgeous during Autumn.
Nicer scenery in winter,Have been twice - once in autumn n once in winter. Felt that the winter scene is much nicer when it comes to taking pictures. Do be careful while walking though as it can turn out to be pretty slippery.
A must see in Seoul,"There is so much history in this palace. Take the audio tour and if you get the chance, watch the changing of the guards!"
Great visit ,Go on Saturdays to enjoy plays at the museum inside the temples. It would be nice to have a guide to explain the history of each building. 
Interesting,"It's an interesting place but although the site is ancient, the current remains are not so old. Going in the winter does not show it off as best as it could be."
Boring ,We made an appointment for a tour guide through the government tourist website. It was a free of charge. The tour started around 10:30am and ended around 12pm... There are no signs to describe what I was looking at. Most of the palace was rebuilt. There is a folk museum and a palace museum that you can visit for free. The folk museum is near the back of the palace and the palace museum is across from the ticket booth. After visiting these museums you can you use the same ticket you purchased for the palace to get back into the palace area. 
The cold never bothered us anyway ❄️🇰🇷,"..it was winter and snow just showed up when we were walking around the palace, and it was freezing cold :) ..but despite of the freezing cold weather, there were still plenty of tourists including us! Several ladies were in their Hanboks and they looked great with the snow covering the trees in the background. ...a must visit place when in Seoul "
Beautiful!,We decided to wear hanboks on the day that we visited Gyeongbukgung so we were able to enter without paying the entrance fee. It was beautiful inside and well-laid out. I was amazed by the architecture and the grandeur of the place.
Great place. Very grand. ,Need to be PROPERLY attired for winter. Wind is bone chilling cold. Information on the history is a little thin. Can’t really follow. Maybe it’s me. 
Well-laid out palace,"If arriving via the subway (Gyeongbokgung station), the palace is only a short 5min stroll. The subway exit opens up next to the National Palace Museum inside the palace grounds. It is worth going to the front entrance (Gwanghwamun gate) for the Gwanghwamun plaza and statue of Admiral Yi Sun Sin. This front gate is also where the changing of the guards take place. Back inside the palace grounds, the ticket counters are along the east side of the complex, audio guides are available for rent, recommended for more insight about the palace as there are limited signage in the palace. Apparently people wearing hanboks get a discounted price for ticket entry or possibly free.The courtyards are well laid for an easy stroll and looked after along with manicured gardens. Unfortunately during our visit in late October , the Hwanwongjeon pavilion was closed off for renovation works. Price of entry also includes the free entry exhibitions in the National Folk Museum (there were some exhibitions that require additional admissions). Cafe, museum shop and washroom facilities were also available here in addition to some back outside in the palace courtyards."
Photo time!!,This is a place to go to see the traditional change of guard. And lots of photos can be taken even outside the palace without paying to go in. You can rent a Traditional Customs nearby and you get to enter the palace for free.
Tiring but worth it,"This is a very large Palace..If you will go here prepare to walk, walk, walk and walk.. prepare your feet, enjoy the view and take a lot of pictures"
ReNewed Palace,"The palace itself as been reconstructed and seems to serve as a hub for tourists though many Korean families were there --perhaps from outside the city as well as ""Seoulites"". It was interesting to see the other buildings that will be reconstructed as part of the Korean effort to reclaim their history, They are using old documents, paintings etc. as guides.We timed our visit to see the the changing of the guards. Recommend doing this, And having a guide or really good guidebook helps better understand the importance of the palace and what went on there.Fun place for families...Little kids we saw were loving the changing of the guards--"
Impressive UNESCO site,"Buy the combination ticket if you plan to visit the various palaces around Seoul. It will save you a few WON. Just be mindful of which dates the different locations are closed (some on Monday and some Tuesday). The site itself is lovely to walk, and you'll see dozens of young people dressed in traditional hanbok dresses and suits wandering around taking selfies. "
Pretty palace with relatively large palace grounds,"Nice to visit for a first time but probably not someplace to revisit again since there are other palaces as well. Palace grounds were quite large, but a lot of them were recently rebuilt and after awhile things started to look the same. If you wear a Hanbok you get in for free, else you pay KRW3000 per person (buy tickets at the ticket counter to the side before the entrance gates so don't line up directly at the entrance gates like we did)!"
Beautiful Palace Grounds.,"Prepare to spend at least an hour exploring the palace grounds. On the north side of the palace, you can visit a museum as well as the Blue house. "
Young people from high school act as tour guide,"We came here in December and not much scenery. There are students waiting for you at entrance that speaks English and Mandarin to give you tour.They explained the various part of palace , the oven outside the building to heat up the palace, the reason for having a river to divide up the palace from town...etc.I will not consider to come in winter since it is sluggish , dragging my feet in the snow is not comfortable at all.Hope you find this review helpful and vote for me."
Palace of Joseon Dynasty ,"This is one of the main royal palace built in Joseon Dynasty. It’s a nice palace but because the weather was too cold (-6deg), we didn’t spent much time there. There are people who put on hanbok (traditional korean costume) and take pic in the palace. You could enter the palace FOC (normal ticket fee is KRW3,000 for adult and KRW1,500 for children), if you enter it with hanbok. "
Amazing,"Theres not much stuff to see if you don’t like traditional scenery. For me this tour was educational and amazing to see structures with very beautiful art. You can even rent traditional palace clothing outside the vicinity. It was negative degrees when I came December this week, so during this season its very advisable to wear appropriately not to get sick. We paid i think 3000 or 4000 won for me and mt friends since they said about something being free of charge but I forgot. They have a mini show in front gate with the guards marching but mostly thats it.. your not allowed to come inside the kings office and other rooms but u can take pics by the outside. Overall it was great and crowded but surprisingly clean since I did not see trashes loitering around. Thats how the people there are disciplined. "
Travelling back to Joseon Dynasty,"Built in 1395, stepping into Gyeongbokgung Palace is like travelling back in time to Joseon Dynasty where you can dressed up in traditional hanok as Gongjunim or Jeonha, wondering around the palace , taking beautiful pictures against a backdrop of majestic architecture so rich in history & culture. Here's 2 considerations which may be helpful if you are travelling in the winter months:1. Every last wed of the month is free entry. So if you are travelling end of the month, consider visiting on a wed. The palace is close on Tue anyway.2. Consider wearing long john or thermal undergarments if you plan to dress up in hanok as it get very chilling & windy in the big palace. The palace is very well preserved & clean. However, it is also very crowded with many tourists especially in the front, making it very hard to take pictures without being 'photobomb' by visitors. Unless you are on a 2 hour express hanok rental, otherwise, we suggest you skip the guided tour & take your time to wonder deeper into the palace to enjoy the beautiful scenery & create beautiful memories with photos. "
A trip back in time,Amazing experience. Like traveling back in time. You have to watch the change of guards as well. The Palads is a must see in Seoul
Beautiful,"Gyeongbokgung Palace is absolutely stunning, with amazing traditional Korean architecture. I would highly recommend this to anyone visiting Seoul."
"The ""big momma"" of all palaces","Among the palaces in Seoul, the stately Gyeongbokgung Palace is the undisputed ""big momma"" of them all. You can tell by the number of visitors thronging the site, with some donning the traditional hanbok to get in the mood. Tickets are 3000 won for adults and 1500 for youths below 18. The palace grounds are enormous and dotted with many many buildings to explore, and you can spend an entire day there without getting board. There is so much history here. Just tag along any of the free walking tours and you'll know why."
Changing of Guards Ceremony,"We were in Insadong and decided to drop in for the changing of guards ceremony at Gwanghwamun 2pm.Arrived early at 1.30pm and managed to see the military training performance as well.The performances were just ok. Nothing grandiose. Can watch if you happen to be in the area, but I wouldn’t travel just to see it.(We didn’t visit the palace.)"
"Nice scenery, must visit","The biggest palace was a must visit place for our family. We went in Dec and it was so cold. We managed to catch the 2pm guard changing ceremony and it was just outside the main entrance. We went on a Mon morning and there wasn't a big crowd. Quite a number of tourists wearing hanbok walking around taking pictures, and it was sooo cold. Conected directly to the subway and very convenient. Toilet was difficult to find though, we had to ask around. The scenery was very nice and we enjoyed the palace. "
Huge compound to explore ,"If you're looking for a huge Palace to explore, this has to be your first stop. It's so vast that it took us an hour or so to explore. This place has many areas, that if you're looking for photo opportunities, just go further in. People usually gather in the front, taking photos, not knowing that they have so many chances to get better photos where it's not crowded further in. I went here in late November where the wind was strong, making the cold bearable, but uncomfortable on the face. Wrap up and bring chapstick! Additionally, I really think the admission price is worth it. 3000 Korean won for a big place to appreciate its architecture, landscape amd history is a win for me."
Gorgeous palace,"Gyeongbokgung palace, the obvious seat of government in older times, is a showpiece for the city, staring down at the city's main avenue through the reconstructed Gwanghwamun gate, giving it the proper sightlines so important in eastern palace layouts. Seen from the outside from the newly built pedestrian center area of that avenue, the gate and palace grounds are nicely framed by a backdrop of green mountains.Being the main palace in Seoul, it features a number of displays, including performers in traditional dress showing various aspect of court pageantry. Also worth visiting is the folk museum within.The buildings are predictable large and ornate, and more geometrically laid out than at other palaces. The detailing and shape of the roofs are unique, and the large number of carved stone figures, some of them unfortunately encased in transparent boxes due to unruly visitors, interesting indeed. As usual in such palaces, the women's sleeping quarters have a more livable look to them.Maintenance and upkeep are very good, reflective of the country's current prosperity."
Very beautiful palace,"Must visit when in Seoul. Buy ticket pass to enjoy this palace and the other three, Changdeokgung, Deoksugung, Changgyeonggung. I came when Chuseok and it's free entry. Visit Jongmyo shrine too."
Amazing place!,They have guards at front gate. The buildings have been beautifully restored to its former glory. You will see a lot of locals dressed in historic outfits walking around. Apparently you can enter for free if you are wearing this. It is a large area so reserve at least two to three hours for your visit.
Must Visit Attraction,"Worth the visit. Tickets at KRW3,000 per adult and 1,500 for children. Wear a hanbok and entrance is free. Nice to walk around and take pictures. Change of guards at 10am, 11am,12pm,1pm,2pm and 3pm. Free guided English tour at 11am, 1pm and 3.30pm."
Large palace,The largest palace in seoul built in 1395 built by the Joseon dynasty and one of the well preserved and maintained palace. Where you can see and experience the rich culture and history of south korea. Its a must visit landmark in seoul.
Beautiful attraction,Good place to visit and take pictures. The weather wasn't too cold when I travelled so was very enjoyable. 
Epic visit,"Visitors to Seoul should definitely not miss this gem. It's amazing how Seoul has been able to preserve such heritage. Very clean, calm, and relaxing to stroll and see the corners of the palaces. "
Amazing Experience ,Easy to get here in the metro and a short walk from/to Insa-Dong. This is an amazing retreat from the busy bustling city just outside the walls. The palace grounds are peaceful to wander independently or a self guided tour reading placards and handouts. I’m sure a guide would make it an even more incredible experience if you have time and the preference. Renting the Hanbok nearby makes for a fun photo shoot for some (makes for interesting people watching for others). Definitely worth the trip and a great place to bring visitors if you are living in the area. Beautiful to see and accessible to other lovely areas to explore. 
Great place to visit,"Worth to visit, the culture and history place are well manage. they open during night on a certain period, the light are so beautiful at night. when there is are public holiday such as chusok, they give for free entrance"
Main place to see,"even though its been fully rebuilt, alot of the old old charm still shines through. Expect to spend a few hours roaming around the grounds"
The main palace to see,We have seen most of the palaces in Korea. This one is the main one to see. Make sure to book an English tour inside and be ready to spend 2-3 hours as there is a lot to see.
Beautiful palace,Well worth the visit. This is a very cultural site with great history and well managed. I always come here when i visit Korea
Beautiful ,"It was a beautiful place to see. It’s an insight into the history of Korea. If you’re planning to visit I suggest you go wearing a traditional Korean dress called a Hanbok which also gives you a free pass to the Palace. However, if you want to visit ‘The Secret Garden’ (another part of the Palace) you have to pay admission fee. It was a memorable experience. I went during November which means the weather was a bit cold, so it was uncomfortable wearing a Hanbok at the time as it is a thin material. If you want to wear a Hanbok, you can rent it from Oneday Hanbok. It’s cheap and if you want the best looking Hanbok you have to be in early or make a booking via their email. "
If I ever go back I'll have to visit again,"A big part of the palace is closed for renovation right now. So it might be worth going again, but in the current state, it's a pretty large palace and a nice promenade, not much else."
Grand and amazing Palace,"Being a fan of kdrama, I have watched several period drama where the plot is in Josean era. Gyeongbokgung palace reminds me of these drama and it gave me a lot of goosebumps. But take note that this palace is closed every Tuesday so plan your trip and consider their operation days. "
Pretty as anything,"Very nice to visit. I visited during a long lay over. Would recommend to do same.Extremely traditional and picture perfect.Exactly what you expect when in Seoul. Also, as opposed to my normal dealings, I bought some very nice souvenirs in the souvenir shop."
Beautiful palace in Seoul city,Must visit tourist spot in Seoul. Very big palace with interesting stone carvings and traditional buildings. Watch changing of the guards procession. Easily accessible.
Nice attraction,"I's nice but all the palaces have been locked and the tourists can only look around, can not go inside to see more about the architecture. A bit disapointed."
Different and beautiful ,A nice contrast to normal life in Seoul.. a must see if you are a true traveller.. very beautiful kept and a fantastic view info korean history...
Worth checking out,"Worth checking out. Palace, although smaller than the Forbidden City, was still quite large. Was nice to walk through it and see all the fall colours. Be sure to check out the elevated pagoda thing by the pond in the middle. The view of the mountains is also very nice when you walk further Northwest. You can't see inside many buildings though so you don't really need to walk through it all. You won't miss much if you don't, save the view."
Old legend,The place is known for being a tourist spot. I am not a big fan of palaces so for me the place was OK. However the place gives a very good insight on the Korean culture 
Great place for Hanbok photos,"If you are wearing the traditional Hanbok, then you no need to pay entrance fee. Good place for photo shoot during autumn."
Must see!,This is the highlight of Seoul for sure. It's so full of culture and beauty. Walk around the grounds and the gardens. I also highly recommend stopping at the tea house for some traditional tea and snacks. The tea was delicious; the snacks were...interesting. But it was such a great experience! You have to do it.
Underwhelming ,"An okay enough place to visit. It was pouring with rain when my wife and I visited. We were a little underwhelmed when comparing it to other palaces in Asia. Nonetheless, it is one of Seoul’s main attractions. We spent 30 minutes there, and thought that was plenty of time. "
Must See in Seoul,These beautiful grounds and buildings reminded me a lot of the Forbidden City in Beijing. Plan to spend a few hours walking around. There are lots of signs in English and free English guided tours available. This is a beautiful place that is a must see on anyone's trip to Seoul. It's cool to see old buildings set against the modern skyline.
Don't miss the Free Guided Tour,"Gyeongbokgung is the biggest palace in Seoul. It is near the City Hall, Insadong and is easily accessed by metro (blue line to Jongak Station). If you enter the Palace through Gwanghwamun, you will find the information center on your right. There is an entrance fee of 10000W per adult. You can check out the free guided tour (1 hour; in English) and the time of the guard change. You can also get a palace map (in English). We used it to navigate and find washrooms.The guided tour was very informative and the tour guide spoke fluent English. The tour guide showed us different buildings / courts where the King, the Queen and the Queen mother lived. She also pointed out the in-floor heating system used in those buildings and where were the chimneys. It definitely helped us understand more about the Korean culture, architecture and how the royal family lived. We saw a lot of young students and teenagers dressed up with the traditional Hanbok. It makes it seem like you are at the ancient time. The Palace is huge and has a strong contrast with its surrounding buildings. The architecture of the buildings is unique and all of the buildings are nicely maintained. There is a museum, gift shops and a snack bar inside the Palace. There are washrooms near the entrance and museum. We spent about 4 hours in the Palace. After we exited the Palace through the main entrance, we strolled around the area on the left of the Palace. There are lots of cafes, restaurants, a Daiso etc. We had lunch at a famous restaurant for ginseng chicken soup (Tosokchon). We really enjoy all the visits.My tip to the Palace: go there early in the morning and take lots of pictures first. Then join the free guided tour (the first one is 11am)."
Can feel old Korea ,Gyeongbokgung Palace is huge. We couldn’t see everything even though we were in 2 hours. And I think if you wanna go the palace you should wear sneaker . Gyeongbokgung Palace is worth seeing. You can feel you are in Korean historical drama 
A too see place,"One of Seoul’s place to see, lots of tourist and it is the biggest of the Palaces but it is not all finish yet lots of restoration being done as of now!"
A must when in Seoul,"Magnificently located in the bustling city of Seoul, this palace is worth seeing! One must have ample time to walk around or walk with a historian at least."
Beautiful Palace and grounds,"Autumn around Gyeonbokgung was certainly a delight, amazing architecture and gardens with the opportunity to try some royal tea and confectionary."
Beautiful Palace,I believe this is the largest palace that I visited while in Seoul. I bought the combination palace ticket which included 4 palaces and a shrine. This palace was beautiful. It is a must see even if you’re not interested in the history behind it. The grounds that the palace is located on is very vast as well. They offer brochures in multiple languages so it’s very convenient to visit. 
"Most Popular Korean Palace/ Adult Admission 3,000won","Expect about 2-3 hours, depending on the crowd and personal pace of movement. The actual Palace grounds is very large and the architecture is beautiful. The Palace is also connected to the Korean Folk Museum, which is free. Wear comfortable shoes. There are traditional Korean outfit rentals nearby, which is very popular. There were a lot of families with strollers, however there are some areas parents will have to pick up the stroller to access some entrances. Fee for adults is 3,000won. Less for children."
"Beautiful architecture, becomes repetitive","Expansive grounds but very crowded even on the (literally) freezing and rainy day we visited. Free guided tours but an informative pamphlet with map is sufficient. The smaller buildings start to get repetitive as they are all identical in architecture and painting, so we ended up spending more time on the larger and more interesting buildings."
Awesome! ,"Lovely place to walk around and see the traditional and cultural part of Korea. It’s actually a huge place you can spend around 2 to 3 hrs depend on you. Can rent the traditional clothes and walk around to the palace. I came here during autumn season so I really enjoyed the sorroundings. I didnt see restaurants or shops inside so make sure your full if energy when you start sightseeing here. You need to buy ticket for the entrance fee. Some go for tour guide some don’t, like what I did I just go by myself and explore the area."
Big place; be prepared to walk,Big place also flanked by palace museum and folk art museum. Can get confusing. The map can do with better navigation. Be prepared to walk in the outdoors. Can be chilly in winter. The saving grace was the English guided tour. The guide was very knowledgeable. Kids took the audio rental but it wasn’t intuitive to use and it kept repeating. Kids say the audio tour they experienced in Alcatraz was much better
 interesting,I went here as part of a business conference. The architecture and history were very interesting. The palace and grounds are beautiful. A good way to understand a little more about the history of Korea.
Closed on Tuesdays,We only got to sneak a peek from the outside so don't go on a Tuesday if you want to go inside. Seen many traditional dresses on people. They get in for free to certain attractions...very lovely. You can rent them too if you wanted to in the area.
A must while in Seoul...,"This is one of the principal places of the Joseoon Dynasty in Seoul which was established few centuries back. There are several halls and requires 1-2 hours to see. The whole temple complex is huge and very attractive. There are free guided tour in different languages including English. One can also see the changing of the Palace Guard Ceremony inside the square at 1000 and 1400 hrs. There is also gate guard duty performance outside the Gwanghwamun Gage at 1100 and 1300 hrs. The temple is closed on every Tuesday. Entry fee: KRW 3000. On weekends and holidays, lot of young local population come there in their traditional dress and make the complex very colorful and attractive. Metro: Gyeongbokgung Station by Line 3 Exit 5 OR Line 5 Exit 2. Highly recommended."
A must see in Seoul!,"A great attraction to visit in Seoul. Very affordable to enter the complex and rather large. The little ponds, lakes and gardens inside are particularly lovely! Well worth a visit!"
It was alright.,The heat kept us from enjoying the place as much. The walk was also too long. Playing dress up was fun though. ☺
Beautiful,"Although the property is huge, the palaces themselves aren't of grand scale. I only mention that because seeing some royalty properties around the world, these don't give off the sense of grandeur. One of the cool things about the Korean palaces is that there's shops that rent out traditional outfits for both men, women, and kids, so when walking the property, there's great photo opportunities of beautifully dressed tourists. Check out my photos to see what I mean."
Great place to view the old palace for the king,"The place is big. It takes quite 1 hour minimum to view the palace. It is better to take your time, relax, take photos of the beautiful place at a leisure pace. There are some shop around the area to rent your Hanbok to walk around the palace and take photo. They are currently rebuilding some building when I visit it. Overall, great trip but a bit tired from all of the walking around."
Must visit palace.,"There are several other palaces in Seoul but this one is a must visit. Spend like 2-2.5hours here, it gives the best feeling. It can be crowded at times but there are certain areas within the palace area that are not and great for photo-op. Gwanghwamun gate is located here also so it's like killing two birds with one stone. Just cross the street when you're done and walk down to Gwanghwamun Square for a photo-op with King Sejong statue. Note that there is a museum under it (the statue)."
Very impressive architecture,Very convenient to get there via the subway. Just alight at Gyeongbokgung station and follow the signages.The outer court is free of charge. But you need to purchase tickets in order to visit the inner courts. The building architecture is amazing and absolutely a great place for photo-taking with family and friends. The place is huge so be prepared to do a bit more walking.
Here's how you do it!,1. Get the Hanbok for rental and get free entrance to the palace.2. Enter the palace.3. Find out the timing of change of guards and be there to witness the change.
Geongbukgung Palace for its Architecture & Walk its historical walls,"This is on top of the 5-palace tour and a scheduled concert on the grounds makes it a must see. You literally walk along paths of Korea’s history and admire its architecture. There are English tours but if you have read its history and armed with a map of the grounds, you can do the tour on your own. It is a bit of a walk and some cobbled stones may be hard for some so wear comfortable and decent clothes, or wear traditional Hanbok for instagrammable photos and you get in free. If you have the time to tour at least 3 palaces then get the combination ticket, you will save a lot."
Great place to wind away a few hours,I very much enjoyed walking around this palace on a sunny cold morning! It took me 3hours ish to wander around and take it all in. It was very peaceful and although it was only rebuilt recently I feel they have tried to keep it as traditional as possible. Don’t miss out walking down the west side past all the trees! They were looking so beautifully this time of year. I enjoyed watching all the korean people in the traditional dress running around and taking photos. Such a sweet thing to see! 
"Beautiful Palace, make sure visit the National folk museum behind the palace too!","The palace is well-maintained and beautiful. Entrance fee of S$3.80. Will be nice to be there at 10 or 11am, or 1pm and 2pm to watch the performance.We spent a good 1.5 hours walking around the palace. This place is huge.There's a National Folk Museum just behind the palace and the entrance is free. Make sure to check that out. It's a fantastic museum gives lots of information about how Korean cultures like. Totally enjoyed it. You can also rent a costume at the shop nearby the museum. Must-see in Seoul if you're first time there."
Just symbolic,"Even though it's the symbol of ambient Korea, the majority of this palace is built in recent 200 years. One thing I do like is the respect and promotion to traditional culture here. If you wear Hanbok, the entry is free."
Unique Experience,We were part if a tour when we went there and ao we didn’t get to experience to fall in line for the tickets. I was imagining the k-dramas I’ve watched as I was touring the place. It was fun seeing people wearing the korean clothes in touring the place and I plan to wear a hanbok on my next trip to the palace.
Lovely grounds and great historical reenactment,"We saw the changing of the guard re-enactment. It was very well done with commentary in Korean, English, Japanese and Chinese, making it accessible to all. Good job to all involved! The grounds of the palace are quite large - lots of walking - but you can also see the main sights without going too far if you don't want to walk much. Many people rent traditional dress for their visit, which was great to see too. Lots of beautiful hanboks."
Nice Place But A Bit Empty,"This is well worth a visit if you are in Seoul. It is huge and will easily take 2-3 hours to get round. The buildings, while for the most part reconstructions, are impressive, especially the throne room, even if most a reconstructions following the destruction of the originals by the Japanese when they annexed Korea. There are a lot of locals in traditional costume too - easy to hire nearby and gets them in for free as well as making for more picturesque photos.It is stupidly cheap to get into: a couple of dollars/pounds/euros equivalent.Do take one of the free guided tours in English (10am and 2pm but check). Without one of these, or a Korean speaker, you will be pretty-much in the dark as to the function of buildings and underlying stories. The only building open to view is the impressive throne room and the only one that you can get inside is a small memorial to a queen who was murdered by a Japanese hit-squad for opposing their takeover.I would time a visit to take in the changing of the guard: OK, they are actors but it is well-worth the twenty minutes (and you can get into the front court to see it without paying)."
History and Photo Taking Galore,Fair warning the palace is huge. Lots of photo taking opportunities especially if you're into renting the traditional costumes. There are several opportunities to catch actors reenacting scenes of the king and queen moving around with their entourage. Also the change of guard ceremony really brings you back in time. Found the best time to take pictures is just before closing. You'll have 30mins to an hour to yourself to grab some good shots without a tourist walking into your frame.
Beautiful large palace and grounds in the middle of a bustling city,We spent about two hours walking around on a late weekday afternoon. The palace grounds were busy but not overcrowded. Not many employees there to help answer a question if we had any but that did not detract from a very pleasant and inexpensive (less than 5 euro) walk around a beautiful area. We were not able to catch any of the shows but heard from another guests they are worth seeing. Would definitely recommend to do when in Seoul.
Lovely historical palace,Nice historical palace in Seoul you will enjoy typical Korean architecture and history with lovely style and colors
Nice place ,We visited the palace on the last day. Can only visited part of it because we need to go another place. The weather was sunny. Many local people wearing the national costume visited the palace. Luckily we can see the shift ceremony.
A Must!,This is a must when you visit South Korea!! Be sure to catch the shows offered at 10 AM and 2 PM — gives great insight to the Korean culture. Traditional Korean attire is available for rental at nearby shops — feel free to rent one for the full experience. 
A pleasant walk,"The Gyeongbokgung Palace is very large and it’s a pleasant walk around the structures and green spaces. To get there, get off at the Gyeongbokgung station (metro/bus) its 2 blocks away/ 5 min walk to the palace, some buses may take you just in front of the palace but check your route for details. Maybe before or after your visit you may enjoy a lunch at Tosokchon Samgyetang (opens at 10:30) only a short walk away, they are known for their ginger chicken soup but expect long lines after 12 noon. I didn't think there was a lot to see but architecture and the cultural value is worth a visit. You can try to be at the front entrance for the changing of the guard at 11:00 and 13:00 (free). I must warn you the changing of the guard is more of a reenactment and is a bit “cheesy” as the guards are more actors than real guards, they're pictures ops for tourists, the fake beards doesn't help. I would think as part of the job they would have to have a real one. If you want to go inside go to the right pass the entrance to get a ticket, 3000w/pp. I recommend making your way up to the National Folk Museum of Korea and exit the palace by the gates just below. That exit gate is only a short walk to the Bukchon Hanok Village."
Lots of walking space in a historic site,"This palace complex is easily reached by the metro. It offers a very nice day visit in autumn to view some autumn foliage, and offers large areas of walking spaces. The attractions are nicely spaced out, sothat even though there are huge numbers of visitors, we were able to easily find some quiet spots to relax and see some of the structural attractions.Allow about half a day to view the different structural buildings in a relaxing mode. There was an ongoing renovation of some iconic sights in the palace complex which we were not informed. But still, it made for a nice autumn day trip. In terms of autumn foliage, Deoksugung is more spectacular.Public restrooms were extremely clean, as always we have experienced in Seoul."
Exciting experience in Gyeongbokgung Palace,An interesting place to visit. The palace is really spacious with a lot of interesting spot to take nice picture Don't forget to wear Korean traditional hanbok too!!
Must for First-timer,"We were able to watch the exchange of guards in the palace at 1pm, the ceremony lasted for 10 minutes. They use big drums and old flutes before the guards do their marching."
景福宮,"Visited on 15/11/2017, massive palace in the middle of the city.The palace was clean, gardens were well looked after.Great place to spent a couple of hours.Entrance fee 3000 Won."
Visit for the colored leaves ,Full of colored leaves every where. The weather was great so we could enjoy the nature literally. Full of visitors in traditional customs that make the garden more beautiful. The house “Geonchung-gung” where King Gojong and Queen Min lived together was still open for public. Geonchung gung is the place where Queen Min was assassinated by Japanese street gangsters. 
"If there's only one place to visit in Seoul, make it this one","This palace is really beautiful and really huge. Even though there was a lot of people, you can just turn a corner and found out you are alone in this place filled with history. Do take the guided tour although my tour guide was not really that good. After that, do take your own time exploring the palace. The gardens are especially gorgeous during the autumn season. Do not miss the guard changing ceremony."
Majestic! ,Went at the right time so managed to have a glimpse of the guard-changing ceremony! I rented the audio guide and it was really helpful!  
Nice palace with beautiful spots,"It is such a large palace in the central of Seoul. You can take subway there easily as the signage is everywhere.The palace is beautiful with traditional architecture. If you rent hanbok to wear then entrance tickets are free. Again, it is very crowded for photos. It is quite spacious so wear comfortable shoes and hats. It is a popular placeso a lot of tourists wearing hanbok, which is quite nice. Hanbok rental shops are just opposite the street. There are some spots in the palace under construction including beautiful pond with red leaves. Hope it can be finished soon. "
Great place to learn Korean History,The palace is just amazing. It is beauty and grand at the same time. It's a nice place to learn Korean history at the same time you can enjoy the scenery.
Beautiful Palace in the Heart of Seoul ,"This palace is a must-visit if you're in Seoul! I'm so glad my fiancé and decided to check it out, because it was definitely one of my favorite parts of our trip. The palace is massive and so beautiful! We were a little short on time when we visited, so I'd suggest giving yourself two hours to visit. There is also a metro stop right inside of the palace - Gyeongbokgung Station."
I love this palace from dramas and readings but...,Our guide was bad and the famous Hyangwonjeong Pavilion was closed for renovation. I wish my family would have gone in ourselves and read the signs and blocks patiently rather than joining the free tour. It was morning and it spoiled our day.Positive note : the Changing of Guards were nice
Beautiful palace,"We visit the palace during autumn where the tree start to turn orange and yellow. Many people wear traditional korean costumes making the place more special. the palace is quite big and need 1-2 hours to walk around, or even spend more times when you like to see it in a more detail ways."
Impressive,"Very impressive in size. Well maintained. We did not have time to visit the museums but will take the time when we come back. Many people wearing traditional tunics made this experience very special. I was almost more interested by them than the palace itself!We did not take a guide, which would have probably made the tour more interesting. For 3,000 won, it is a nice place to visit and you can take time to wander and immerse yourself in the old, while the new Seoul is only steps away."
A four-hour palace experience,"This place brings you back to the monarch times of royal families in South Korea. This is a very huge place with wonderful scenery around during autumn! Leaves of various trees with different leaves colors and hues ranging from reds, browns, yellows, greens to any color you can think of in between those mentioned colors. The royal guard parade in the morning is one of the highlights of the palace visit. Many tourists enjoy the sight in this place along with the 2 more palaces situated nearby this area. The structure of this palace shows how meticulous ancient people were in designing intricately the style of this palace. Indeed a Korean-like experience especially when you wear their national costume when you are roaming around the place."
Grand palace,"This is a must visit in Seoul. We didn't do a tour but enjoyed walking round and taking pictures. Entry fee was 3,000 won which was about £2. We spent a good few hours here and enjoyed it."
Largest of the Five Grand Palaces,"Gyeongbokgung Palace is a superb place that the whole family would definitely enjoy. The palace is surrounded by establishments where you can find ""Hanbok"" or ""Korean Traditional Dress"" for rent. It is located at the heart of capital of Seoul (Hanyang) and at the back of it is ""The National Folk Museum of Korea"". When we visited, there's an ongoing cultural presentation which they sang beautiful traditional songs.Insadong-gil is just a walking distance from Gyeongbokgung Palace that's well known as ""traditional streets"" where you can find traditional porcelain, metal and wooden chopsticks, handcrafted keychains and handmade wallets.*Located at 161 Sajik-ro, Sejongno, Jongno-gu, Seoul, South Korea*Entrance going to Gyeongbokgung Palace - 3,000 won (each)"
Must visit,"In every city that you visit, there is always that one place you have to go to otherwise you cant really say that you have been to that place. And I think for Seoul, its this place. On our itenerary, originally we were to visit palaces during a Sunday but because the DMZ tour was fully booked on our scheduled day, we had to rearrange our schedule. So we decided Monday for palaces. Big mistake since all the palaces were closed on Mondays EXCEPT for this one. And we were exceptionally happy that we were lucky enough that this wasnt closed on a Monday because we would have been missign a lot. Now, we went by ourselves to this palace. And I think this place would be visited best with a guide to explain what the buildings were and their importance. When we visited the Forbidden City in Beijing we did so and it was extremely insightful and I wish we did the same when we went to Gyeongbokgung.Now if your here just for some photo ops wearing hanboks, then you wont really care for that tour but for someone who likes history do hire a guide.For photo ops, autumn is a great time for that. The golden tres juxtaposed with the palaces would really lool great wearing your rented hanbok. "
Must visit,Although we missed the changing of the guards we totally enjoyed the palace grounds. Must visit especially in autumn - very surreal- and affordable too at 3000 kwn (freebif you are wearing hanbook). Allow at least 2-3hrs to cover the grounds and its surroundings. 
Nice visit to look back at korea history,"It is a crowded tourist place. Nice to see the guard changing ceremony. Visitor is allowed only to see the outside of the buildings inside the palace. not all of the buildings are accessible, the huge lands are only accessible for certain parts only. The most disappointing aspect is that this palace was destroyed so many times and the buildings seen today is recent. And not 1000 +++ old. "
Nice palace ,Well worth the visit if you are in Seoul for a few days. Very impressive oriental structures and the grounds are very well maintained. Cheap enough entry and was easy to get to by subway
Nice place to visit,I spent almost 4 hours here. I suggest you to come here in the morning so you could stay longer. We were so lucky that we got a free tour guide that day. Don’t forget to try the hanbok and watch the exchange guard ceremony. Very recommended. 
Nice palace and history,Went on a Monday and it was not too crowded. Managed to join the English walking tour and the guide was great in sharing the history. The buildings were very well maintained.Apparently visitors dressed in hanbok gets to go in for free. There are hanbok rental shops near the palace and Insadong.it was about 20000won for 2 hours. There are many visitors dressed in Hanbok so it does feels like going back in time (if not for the selfie sticks)We took train to Anguk Station and walk to the palace.. about 10mins walk. Join the guided tour..
Well laid out and maintained. Many people in Hanbok costume,"This was a very pleasant Palace to visit. It's only 3,000 Won (£2 sterling). which is great value. It a huge area so although there are many visitors it never seemed overcrowded.It's mainly buildings and structures with number of opportunities to view the insides. There is a children's museum exhibition area and a mock up of an old street which was interesting. The grounds were immaculate as you come to expect in Korea....It has an added attraction that there are many (lots and lots) of people in tradition Hanbok costume which really adds to the atmosphere and gives many photo opportunities.You also have free entry to he National Palace Museum of Korea in the same grounds and that is a very impressive museum, first class...... Do not miss visiting the museum.In total it will take at least two hours to go around to give it justice including the museum etc easily three hours.... I feel your better dong one of the palaces thoroughly rather than trying to rush around the all just to tick the box. !!!In summary well worth he visit and do visit the National Palace Museum...."
History at a glance!! ,With splendid palaces and pagodas donning this palace one is taken back in time as one strolls through this complex. The best part of the visit is the traditional guard changing ceremony! And one can get clicked with them once they have taken their place. Would be even better if one can get a hanbok to move around and have that authentic feel.
A Must Visit Palace,"One of the biggest palace.Rent a hanbok, stroll the palace and take pictures. Free entrance if wearing hanbok.Come on weekdays."
Overrated,"We felt this palace is too overrated since the artifacts inside are not all original, many were destroyed during the Japanese occupation. The palaces are quite small (if compared to China's Forbidden City) and not much to see. Some parts are also being restored/ rebuilt."
Hanbok experience,"Its a good place to wander around wearing hanbok, and you are free to enter if you wear one. We got to see the changing of the guards ceremony and its like a kdrama scene. The place is pretty specially in autumn."
Grand Palace,"The nearest metro station is Gyeongbukgung Station on Line 3.This Palace is an impressive set of buildings. It was built three years after the founding of the Joseon Dynasty. It has an interesting history. It was destroyed during the Japanese invasion in the 16th century. It was rebuilt in 1867. It was again destroyed by Japanese occupation in 1915 and replaced with the headquarters of the Japanese government. The present Korean government has embarked on an ambitious restoration project started in 1990 to bring the palace to its former glory. The backdrop to the palace is Mount Bugak. The main entrance to the palace is through Gwanghwamun Gate. There is a colourful changing of the guard ceremony held every morning. Within the grounds are the National Folk Museum of Korea and the National Palace Museum of Korea. Also, the offices of the King and the Korean state officials are located within the outer court of the palace walls. The inner court has the residences for the royal family. The Queen’s palace and the Crown Prince’s palaces are within the main Gyeongbokgung palace.Admission for adults are 3,000 Won (equivalent to about GBP2.00 Aug 2017).In the summer months of June, July and August, the opening hours are 9am to 6.30pm – and the last admission is one hour before closing time. It is closed on TuesdaysThere are facilities for the disabled like free wheelchair rental, parking access, ramps and toilets."
Not as expected,"Usually I'm the architecture junkie that make sure every trip is filled with historical sites and buildings, but Gyeongbokgung to be honest, didn't lived up to my expectations. The palace is rather big and empty( in terms of decor / plants etc) I'm not sure if its because I went in Autumn, and the plants died off + there was an event setup going on in the middle of the palace (kinda ruins the vibe). Some of the buildings are closed of for repairs extension for winter(?), which made my visit kinda disappointed. But the palace was rather big and the museum at the side was worth the visit."
Wearing hanbok in Gyeongbokgung Palace,For the first time we wearing hanbok. And it is the best experience ever. We will return here again. 
Historical,Imagine having to walk the same paths within the palace walls as the kings of Goryeo ... Joseon Dynasty.
Grandeur,We went on a weekday while my partner rented a Hanbok for 4 hours. Entry to palace (otherwise 3000 won ) was free for people wearing Hanbok. Beautiful palace with a museum inside to explore. Lots of places for ‘ that perfect photo’ opportunity. Good half a day spent on this venue. Highly recommended. 
Back In Time,"This is a place for those who loves historical events. It is a Palace which was been restored under many challenges. Must congratulate the government and the people of South Korea whom had done a really good job.This Palace was built during the Jeoseon Dynasty and had been serving about 27 Kings during the old days.The tour will takes about an hour and a half, we will have the opportunity to explore every building originally occupied by the King, The Queen, and all of their day to day labour.Please come before 11am, as by then, the ceremonial Changing Of Guard will be diaplayed. You can enjoy the show, as it is being done with the most traditional way. Every details were being presented as if we are “back in time”.Enjoy guys!!"
Free English Speaking Tour,"We visited the palace and arrived just as a free English speaking tour was starting, very useful and gave us a real taste for what happened in times past. As an added bonus there was reduced priced entry for seniors, we had photos of our passports on our phones!!"
Gyeongbokgung Palace,"Gyeongbokgung Palace is beautiful we toured around Seoul on a whistle top tour in October on the Hop on Hop off Bus at Chuseok holiday time, this is one of the best times to visit Seoul as the queues are less and most of the attractions are free for the holidays.Unfortunately we had so little time here, but it was beautiful. You must visit this Palace to understand the rich cultural past of South Korea."
Most popular palace out of five,This palace is big but can get so busy. Watch out for the change of guard ceremony times. The pavillion that I was looking forward to is being renovated until 2019. There's a reason to go back then. :)
Beautiful palace!,Really enjoyed my visit at the Gyeongbokgung Palace. We were able to join a free English tour and the tour guide did an excellent job at explaining some of the palaces history. Tip: Join the free tour group. Check website for time.
Colourful changing of the Guard and interesting palace,"The last time we were in Seoul about three years back, we chanced on the changing of the guard at the Gwanghwamun in front of the palace. Then it was crowded with throngs of tourists.On this trip with some friends, we decided we would get a good position to see the entire ceremony and visit the palace as well (a bonus was a visit to the National Palace Museum nearby).Since China curtailed visits by its citizens over the installation of anti-missile systems in South Korea, the crowd was much smaller and we were afforded excellent views of the ceremony.The palace too was likewise not very crowded and gave us lots of time to wander about and admire the architecture and the displays.Free admission to both events was a bonus.And there were lots of people in hanboks, or traditional Korean dress,A while back, a rule was introduced that people wearing hanboks (Korean or otherwise), did not have to pay for entry into the various palaces that charged entry.It was quite amusing to see Caucasians, South Asians, and pretty much everything in between in hanbok.The changing of the guard ceremony is held three times a day, 11.00 a.m., 1.30 p.m. and 3.00 p.m. But check the website and tourist guides."
Very Big Place for a Castle,"A must to place to visit if you are into history of a place. They have a guided tour (English speaking). You can also wear Hanbok, their traditional clothes in South Korea. The place is huge, you can get lost. But they have beautiful garden for picture taking."
Beautiful Palace - best of the five,"This palace is the largest of the five palaces in Seoul, and definitely worth the visit. We toured it during a hanbok festival weekend, so it was very crowded, but the crowds were largely composed of Koreans in traditional dress, and it was a cool experience in itself to see that. I really enjoyed this palace and would recommend it. The guards out front are a great photo op."
A must do in Seoul,If you want to know more about Korea as a first visitor you must see this palace to understand more about the incredibly rich culture of South Korea
Beautiful and historical ,"We loved visiting this place. We were fortunate to go on the last Wednesday of the month and get admission for free. I recommend exiting out the ""back"" entrance and checking out the Blue House, then walking around Hanok village after!"
Good,"Good view /big place/easy to find/wonderful place /i think ,,u should come to there everything is good"
This place is beautiful in autumn ,Visited for a second time when friends from Canada came to see us. Great time of year when the leaves are changing. Colorful Changing of the Guard-worth your time.
Grandest palace of the 4,"If you have to choose from the 4 palaces to visit in Seoul city, choose this. Join the English tour so you will understand the history behind the different structures found in this area."
Free English tour 1130am daily,"English tour was lovely. Very similar to other big Asian palaces- clean and not super crowded. Last Wed of every month is free entry all national heritage sites, but only 10$ entry other days anyways"
Free entry when wearing hanbok,"Rental costs for hanbok costs around 30000 won each for both men and women so it's worth getting as the entrance ticket is around 10000 won. So might as well take pictures with the hanbok if you like the idea!Big complex with many smaller buildings and large gardens. At certain times of the day, there are parades and a change of the guard. Don't miss one of them!"
Need to visit here again!,"We went to Seoul by using a tour package. Our tour guide was so frustrated that the tour package is not inclusive of visiting Gyeongbokgung Palace, Korean culture. Therefore, during the free time, we went here. Not knowing the place is MUCH BIGGER PLACE. We stopped at the second entrance cause the time 11.00 AM will show performance on Royal Gate shift change. There are hourly free guided tour ; English, Chinese, Japanese and etc. Free entrance and you can come here by subway ; Gyeongbokgung. I didnt any see souvenir shop here. Too bad :("
Well worth visiting- magnificent buildings,A must visit sight in Seoul. Extensive buildings of restored royal palace. Changing of the guard is touristy fun. Very little inside the halls except for one exhibition. 
Amazing Palace,"Surroundings are clean and the place is so authentic. You can enjoy korean food inside the palace... Latest Entrance price is 3000won..For those people wearing korean traditional hanbok, entrance is free :)"
Go for the free guided tours,Check when the free guided tours are. This included in your ticket. The palace is not very grand but still beautiful. Our free guided tour was also interesting. A must-do if visiting Seoul for the first time. 
Big palace,Top tourist spot in Seoul. Free entrance if you wear hanbok . Ticket is 3000 for normal admission. Follow the guided tour to understand better on the history of this building.
Great Picture Stop,We stopped here for the sole purpose of taking some great pictures for our walls at home. Other than the site being under construction during our visit which limited the availability of some of the areas we were pleased. 
Majestic Palace in the Middle of the City,"This Palace is a must visit, especially for those visiting Seoul for the first time. The palace grounds are wide and spacious, so it may take up to a half day to explore this historical site. You will just be awed at the design and colours of the place. The weather can be very hot in October, so make sure you bring your sunnies and water bottle. I took a lot of pictures, can’t get enough of the place, but of course the pictures are unable to demonstrate the beauty and atmosphere of the place. So, must really go visit it! "
Definitely worth it ,"So if you are visiting Seoul, I think this palace is definitely worth it. The landscape is beautiful the architectures breath taking. While you are there you can see lots of people dressed in traditional attire and for those picture aficionados, the palace offers great views. Not to mention the history behind the actual palace. "
Lovely place to wander in,"This is a lovely, well maintained palace with lots to see. The grounds are also well maintained and the pond with the pagoda in the middle is a nice view to look at while relaxing and taking in the scenery."
Most popular palace,I underestimated the size of this place and it took me much longer to see the place than I thought. I made sure to arrive in time to see the changing of the guard ceremony.
Part of the History,"Sadly I don’t speak Korean, nor read Korean, if not I would have got more out of it. Nonetheless, if you are interested in Palace, history, pay them a visit. There is a changing guard at the main gate at 9am, arrive there around 8:40 so you beat the crowd and get a front roll seat!"
Once upon a time in Korea...,Access to the attraction was convenient via subway. The structures and buildings are well preserved or refurbished.The free explanation tour available in few languages is highly recommended. Do check the official website for the available languages and timing. Embark on a 1.0-1.5 hours history lesson on purposes of the buildings and imagine how they would look like in the old times.We went with young baby in a stroller. We found out that certain areas are not so stroller/wheelchair friendly but overall was ok.Plenty of spots for good phototaking on a nice sunny day so bring your lenses!
Impressive Palace,An impressive location in the middle of the large city and in the area of parliament and government buildings. Many interesting palace buildings. It is recommended to take a guided tour as it helps to understand the historical happenings.
Beautiful!,"I've been to Korea three times, and every single time I always visit Gyeongbokgung Palace. I can never get enough of this beautiful ancient relic.On my recent trip, my family and I decided to wear hanboks and it made for some amazing pictures. The entry for the palace is free, if you hire hanboks."
Great place for a walk,Super love this place. Its beautiful and not so crowded compared to other palace in Seoul. Would come back again for sure.
A must see on visiting Seoul,"The Palace of Shining Happiness is just that. It's relaxing, beautiful and great for photos. Allow 1/2 day to walk around"
Upgaded accesibility,"With access from the subway station named for the palace, buses that stop right in front, and parking spaces almost inside the walls, this palace lends itself to being visited. And on the second of Chuseok this year, many many people took advantage of the free entry and crowded into the palace.As an example of the Joseon dynasty building style, this palace presents all the traditions. Offering many scenic places in which to photograph oneslef and one's companions, it is a lovely place to capture memories.What I personally love is that there are many places where the backdrop to the palace buildings are just the hills behind - no tall buildings, no 21st century intrusions.The museum is worth a visit as well."
Heart of Seoul,If your as hIstory buff or just a tourist looking to see Ancient Korean Culture and architect then this is the place for you. I spent more time here then most observing the layout of the palace grounds and the architect then anything else.
Famous temple but overcrowded,Interesting place but not enough structure or explanation. Nice place to rent a hanbok and snap some selfies. Sometimes there are extra activities or music. A bit overrated in my opinion.
Gd for Photo taking and Instagram friendly,"there's one big palace and a indoor museum. Admission is free to both place. Alot of ladies renting hanbok from nearby shop (facing main road turn right and cross the street, turn right and enter left thru small lane.) rental range from 10k won to 20k won(2hr) 15k to 25k to 4hr and 25k to 35k for whole day. "
"So much history, beautiful in the city","This was a great place to walk about. We visited all of the palaces in about 5 hours time during a Saturday afternoon. So peaceful and a great break from the busy City. All of the building look very similar, but the grounds are worth a look. It was a great afternoon."
Great place to take pictures,"The Guards change ceremony was much better than the one at Deoksugung palace. We bought the royal pass (10,000 won for adult, 5000 won for kids) which includes admission tickets for Deoksugung palace, Gyeongbokgung palace, Changdeokgung palace (inclusive of secret garden admission), Changgyeonggung palace and Jongmyo Shrine. If you have time for only one palace, go to Gyeongbokgung palace if you would like to see the Guards exchange ceremony and experience a traditional Korean tea and snacks served the royal style. "
Recommended tourist attractio,One of the places that recommended to visit. We can rent a Handbook and take nice pictures at the palace. The small palace by the lake was on the old 10000 won billete. Nice palace and very clean.
Huge Palace,"In the middle of town there is a little oasis. Great fun to see the Koreans getting dressed when visiting. Plenty of buildings to see and a nice stroll all around. When we were there, a simulated (mock) attack on the American embassy took place by 3 helicopters and abseilers with some accompanying big bangs - quite spectacular to watch."
Beautiful Scenry Historical Lessons,"Highly recommended to visit this place!Entry for an individual is 3,000 Korean Won (AED 9/ $2). You can either walk the entire place yourself and take time to read the descriptions, or you can catch a free tour (10 people at a time) and they provide guides of different languages (Eng, Jap, Chinese & Korean) just check for timings. Recommeded to go as early as 10AM before the school trips & tour trips come over and over crowd the place!The amount of history in this place is amazing, clean & quite frankly can be a maze!"
Interesting ,"We visited the place for the propose of photography, we took pictures for the tourists with the cultural costumes but the heat was great problem at that time. Most of the palaces for out side view only. But worth visiting. "
Beautiful place!,"Totally worth it to go inside, it costed 3usd pp approx. The place is huge and has amazing views. Also recommended to see the guard change at 10am or 2pm."
Well restored,"This is a lovely way to spend a morning before the crowds, its a large complex and is well restored. We were there during the Chasseuk Holiday so all the palaces were free and many people were dressed in traditional costumes. The changing of the guards is a good thing for kids."
A good place to spend 3 hours,The palace is a vast place to cover. You have to walk a lot to see the sprawling palace and other places located. There is an entry fee. But it is worth the money. You can easily spend around 3 to 4 hours.
Majestic palace,"Since I visited this during Chuseok holiday, it quite crowded and difficult to get nice shot but good thing to compesate that is free entrance. I spent hours admiring their fine art and cant believe this palace so old but still majestic. I figured out lot of entrance to the palace, you can walk from bukchon hanok village, or from dongdaemon or take a subway and stop at jongno-3-ga and walk. Many ways at our convenient. "
Try to Get a Free Tour,"This is Seoul's main palace. It is certainly not to be missed. If you have limited time in Seoul, this is the palace you need to visit. The palace offers free group tours. English tours are every day during 11:00am, 1:30pm, and 3:30pm. The palace also has tours in Japanese and Chinese. Most of what can be seen in the grounds are reconstructions. Interestingly, the Imperial Throne Hall survives both the Japanese colonial rule and the Korean War and is one of Korea's national treasures (National Treasure No. 223). There are still many reconstruction and restoration efforts going on the palace grounds. So, try going back a few years and see what has been returned back to its former glory. "
Breathtaking,"Honestly, the best tourist destination spot I’ve been in Korea. The view of the mountains is amazing. I was in awe throughout the entire time I was there. I highly recommend to rent out the Hanbok from nearby shops for around KRW 10,000-20,000 then go around the palace and take beautiful photos! Getting there is also easy! Google it and you can get the directions there "
Lovely Placr,Very lovely place with lots to see inside. You can take a leisurely walk inside the palace and admire the views. We also went near autumn so the trees were lovely! Definitely one of my favorite places. 
Colorful Changing of the Guards was highlight of visit,"Gyeongbokgung Palace was crowded as it was Chuseok, translated as ""Korean Thanksgiving"" in English. We watched the changing of the guards which displayed colorful uniforms, musical instruments, and formations for the traditional ceremony. One must be in good shape to climb the stairs to the palace."
Awesome ,"Visited on a weekend break to Seoul. Entry to everything was free but not sure if that was because it was Chuseok. The whole place is amazing, really well preserved and rebuilt. The contrast between the skyscrapers and the ancient palace is amazing! When we went there were Koreans dressed in traditional dress walking around and if you turned the corner to an empty courtyard with only a couple of Koreans dressed in Hambok walking along you felt like you'd gone back in time! It's an absolute must in Seoul!!"
Nice,"If u are hanging around seoul u must visit this place, and if u rent an hanbok it will be even better :)"
Major tourist attraction,"The Palace's royal guard changing ceremony is the best experience, providing very good experience of traditional Korea culture and traditional army clothes. The Palace s very similar to China' Forbidden City but i a smaller scale."
History,"We walked to the Palace from Hanok village. From the outside palace doesn’t seem that big, but once you get inside it’s easy to get lost. For someone who lives in China and who saw so many temples Palace itself wasn’t anything new or breathtaking, but for people who have never been to Asia I’m sure it’s breathtaking. I loved the nature. In the end we saw guards in front of the main entrance. They have their show every hour or two. Make sure to rent hanok before coming to the palace to feel like a part of history :)"
Must see historical site,"This is a must-see place, but it's also one of those that doesn't really have any surprises. Splendid architecture, and impressive site and sense of history, but I sort of knew what to expect. Both palaces are worthwhile, and this a bit grander, but with the crowds its not really anything that knocks your socks off, which is why I gave it a 4 and not a 5. "
Go dressed for this one,We had a great day visiting this palace and decided to make a special effort to hire costumes for the family which would gain us free entry into the place as an added bonus.. there are lots of places you can do this and the staff are very helpful in dressing you! As English visitors we were in the minority! It was a very hot day and could only last two hours in the costume but the place could easily be experienced in this time 
A peek into Korean history,"For those who are familiar with korean drama, you would recognise the buildings from this palace. I visited this palace 8 years ago and it is still beautiful. Visitors wearing the traditional hanbok can enter the palaces for free! This is an experience everyone should try.. donning the hanbok in the palace and admiring the beauty of history. Note: there are plenty of people wearing the hanbok so don't worry about being the odd one out. Just go to many of the rental boutique around the palaces. "
Once in a life time !,The palace is one of the must see attractions at Seoul. If you were to rent the Hanbook (traditional Korean) costume you can enter the palaces for free. Great for photo taking.
Step back in time,This palace is a beautiful example of dynastic architecture in Korea. The gardens and buildings are well kept and you can easily spend a large part of your day wandering the grounds. Many rent traditional Korean costumes to wear into the place for free entry and interesting photos. 
Excitement of Seoul's unique beauty,"Gyeongbokgunf palace is located in the center of Seoul, yet you can feel that the palace takes you back to the time of Josun Dynasty.I like the atomosphere of the palace and one can see many visitors wearing Han-Bok there."
A Must Place !,Must place for travellers looking for a real-Korean place for unforgettable memory in Seoul. Five star recommendation.
Beautiful Joseon dynasty palace,I visited Gyeongbokgung Palace with a tour guide in a group. The palace is very big with many buildings and we took lots of photos with the palace in the background. I recommend this place for anyone visiting Seoul. 
Impressive site,"Possibly the largest of the five main palaces in the centre of Seoul, Gyeongbokgung has a lot to see, but it's all rather 'samey'. The original palace is long gone and like the other four, this is a recreation that was redone in 2007. It's hard to imagine the original palaces were as drab and austere as the recreations, but I definitely don't believe they all had exactly the same brickwork, exactly the same woodwork and all had exactly the same paint jobs. The result is that as you wander around, you just see the same thing over and over. Like all the other palaces, you cannot enter any of the buildings. Two of the largest buildings have open doors so you can see inside, but that's as close as you get. The Hyangwonjeong Pavilion is completely closed for renovation as of October 2017 and you can only visit the Gyeonghoeru Pavilion if you have pre-booked (and presumably paid a separate fee). Make sure you buy the Palace Pass for W10,000 as that will give you a big discount on the five palaces and the shrine that it covers. If you turn up in traditional Korean clothing, you get in free (that's true of all the palaces). However, since you have to pay W10,000 for four hours to rent the costume, it's no saving at all."
Amazing History and Architecture,Came here on the tour provided from the airport during a layover. The architecture is just amazing. Photos don't capture just how grand it really is to stand under these amazing buildings. Enjoyed the changing of the guard ceremony. Since this was part of a larger tour we only had about an hour to see the front area and chamber. As I understand it there was much more to see that we just didn't have time for. ideal plan to spend 2-3 (maybe more depending on your stamina and interest level). Enjoy a beautiful picnic. There was a fee to enter but since it was included in the tour price I am not sure how much it was. Enjoy!
huge area and beautiful,"Admission is not free, but i went during their national holiday so it was free entrance when i went there. Huge place and there are many beautiful backdrops for taking photos. However, it was very crowded due to the public holiday. Very relaxed place, but limited shades so recommended to go in the morning or late afternoon. It is a little difficult to walk as the ground are mostly sand and uneven pavement. Wear comfortable shoes!"
The place to be to see tourist and locals in Korean traditional dress,Unfortunately the palace was closed and we only managed to walk around its perimeter and took some photos of its red main entrance door.There were many locals and tourists milling around in colourful hanboks and traditional costumes and taking pictures.
Busy but beautiful,Busy but beautiful. Watch out for the sun and heat as there is not much shade available. Parts of the palace are covered in dirt instead of paved so don't wear your favourite shoes. Would recommend!
Historical ,Located near the city. Watched changing of the guards ceremony and tour guide showed us around the palace. There is a museum near by and good place to start tour. Interesting history. 
Busy Place,Great place to visit. We went during a Public Holiday a great vibe. Beautiful surroundings. Easy to get to on the Subway
WOW 😮 ,"It’s a must to visit this palace. The palace overview the mountain(not sure what’s the name) and it’s was breathtaking. We actually rented the Hanbuk, so we could feel how it’s like to be in a royal family we did a mini photoshoot in the palace itself. You will be mesmerised by it. "
"Good place to visit, but can be very crowded","Although I think there are some other palaces in the world are bigger, but still I enjoyed the visit here. It was South Korea's national holiday when we visited so was super crowded though"
Very Cool,This is a very neat place to see when you are visiting Seoul. It has a lot of history an they offer tours of the Garden in English and Chinese. 
Better than I expected,"First to saw that you can spend one-two hours here if it is not a really hot day. Go EARLY in the morning because the summer heat and humidity will drain all your energy. You'll be mostly in the sun. This is a free attraction and we enjoying it. We got there on as part of a bus tour. I suggest you go by yourself and NOT as part of a bus tour so you can see it at a more leisurely pace and not be rushed by trying to keep up with a tour guide.It is very colorful and unique. They keep it clean and shinny. Lots of history here and you will do a lot of walking because it is a large area. Although there are MANY people on any given day, it isn't very crowded because the area is so large.The guard changing ceremony reminds me of London, but I like this better.Definitely worth your time."
A good glimpse of Korea history.,A glimpse of the history of S Korea. We really enjoyed the changing of guards ceremony and the museum inside the palace.
Palace grounds not actually inside the palace,"You can download an app, it gets more interesting if you hear what the room or that spot was before. If you just walk around there you might get bored as it was just really the palace grounds. People wearing hanbok made it really nice too.I was actually expecting to see the throne rooms, old kitchen, dining area etc... its a nice place to check-out if you are really interested in Korean traditional and historical architecture. You will just walk around the area but you cannot actually go in or I never tried.People will bring their tripod here as it really makes a good backdrop."
Large Impressive Building,Large impressive buildings that look a lot like Chinese architecture. I couldn't really appreciate it because I don't have any context for Korean culture.
Awesome!,Awesome! Visiting this place was really a wonderful experience. I felt like i was being transported to Joseon dynasty. So bad i didn't see the royal guards changing ceremony. 
Palace So-So but Awesome Backdrop,Replica rebuilt. Feels like a theme park. But the mountains backdrop is nice. Gives a sense of wideness and depth.Chuseok week free entrance.
Poor man's forbidden city ,"Had very high expectations of this based on rave reviews on Trip Advisor. But was underwhelmed. It's decent enough. In good condition and some nice architecture, but I guess I've been spoiled with the Forbidden City.Usually 3000 KRW entry but was free for holiday. Checkout the men in traditional uniform. Great for a pic. Multiple entry gates. Not many bathrooms Always busy "
Large Josean palace,"Perhaps the largest and most popular palace. Guards change regularlly (we enjoyed their stuck on beards!), and there was also a parade of royalty, ladies-in-waiting and guards which was fun. All buildings rebuilt and repainted in the 1800-1900s since pretty much burnt down by the Japanese in the 1600s. You see the same Josean period architecture everywhere in Korea (Buddhist temples etc) since most things older seem to have been destroyed centuries ago. Lots of girls and young women in hired Hanok costumes as this gives free entrance but adds to the atmosphere for all. Allow a couple of hours."
Great Palace Located Right in Seoul.,I want to preface this review by saying that although the palace might be smaller than others in Asia I believe it still to be a great experience. One also has to consider that all but a few buildings were destroyed during the Japanese occupation of Korea and it is still under re-construction.I really enjoyed my visit to Gyeogbokgung. You can view many of the old palace buildings and see of the royals of Korea lived before the modern times. There are many artifacts that are original located in the buildings but unfortunately many of the buildings are reconstructions due to being destroyed by the Japanese during their occupation. With this is mind I still believe this is a great experience and a historical attraction that is worth visiting in Seoul. The guided tours in English are also well worth it and are free. The entrance fee is also very cheap and just a couple thousand won!
A wonderful palace in Seoul,No trip to Seoul would be complete without a visit to one of its palaces. You can't do better than the Gyeongbok Palace. It's a well-invested couple of hours.
Beautiful,Gyeongbukgung Palace is worth spending 1-2 hours at. It has beautiful buildings. We also watched the changing of the guards ceremony. After that we tried on the guards costume for free (you can wear for 5-10 minutes).
Not to be missed.,"The Gyeongbokgung Palace was our favorite of all the palaces in Seoul. The grounds are beautiful and the buildings, along with their settings are picture perfect."
I wouldn’t spend more than an hour here,It was good for picture taking but that was pretty much it. I guess because we didn’t have a tour guide with us.
Interesting place ,If you unfamiliar with Asian (Korean-Chinese) history then this place is must visit! You can find all sort of temples and historical reconstructions. Also they have some shows where you can listen traditional Korean music and watch the performance. Lots of art galleries near by. So if you get tired of it then you can change the place to some modern art. 
Worth a visit to get an idea of the histrorical past of Seoul,"Hmmm.. mixed feelings on this, this palace has been rebuilt ( like much of Seouls historical places) ater being destroyed numerous times through war. A little disappointing - none the less it serves as a great vessel to get some background into the histroical past of South Korea"
An interesting visit.,"I especially love the change of guard, rich in tradition. Enjoyed looking at the display of traditional Korean outfits, worn by locals and tourists alike. Had a pleasant walk throughout the vast complex. The palace itself was impressive. It was en enriching experience."
Slice of Korean History,Must see piece of Korean cultural history for any tourists in Seoul! Free admission and musuems attatched to the palace grounds.
Rent your Hambok at Hambokdan,"Renting a Hambok and having your hair done is so worth the less than $2. So fun walking around the palace feeling so special! The palace, although a replica of the original, is ornate and beautiful. "
Visiting on Chuseok,I’ve visited this palace on national holidays it was insane since there’s so many ppl but you can see Korean cultural things It was so beautiful to walk around and was interesting to see it in the center of the city
Gyeongbokgung Palace with Here Korea,Going to the palace was a lot of fun our guide took us to rent hanbok before going to the palace. It was a lot of fun to walk around and see the many things at the palace.
Interesting and historical,"Enjoyed walking around the various palace sites, although it was really crowded with many people (both locals and foreigners) wearing hanboks and taking photos around the palace. The area with the pond area was especially pretty!"
Great,"This was out favourite place to visit during the trip. It let you know more about history about Korea. Beautiful place, if you like history, then you must visit this place"
Gyeongbokgung with Hanbok~,"Went to this palace last two weeks! Didn’t even plan to go here but seeing as it is really close to Insa-dong, we rent Hanbok for two hours and walk around 5minutes to see this palace. So many people so might have to wait in order to get good spots for photos! Overall, great experience even though we don’t have enough time to explore all parts of the palace. Great atmosphere and nice scenery! "
A glimpse of the past,"The area offers a glimpse of the royal past of korea. It provides a better understanding of korean palace life.Tips:- rent a hanbok and walk around in traditional attire (most rentals also include free entrance to related sites)- there are free walking tours (english ) so good to check the schedule at the entrance- study the package offers (single entry ticket vs all entry ticket to 5 related sites) before buying your ticket...and grab a map at the ticket area (maps are free)- wear comfortable shoes, clothing and sunblock...- make sure to hydrate and have a lip balm handy (weather can be sunny AND windy)- for those with medical condition or are easily hungry, bring a snack if you plan to tour everything that is on the map :)- watch out for changing of the guards and other ""presentations""- you can take a picture of/with the guards...the only reminder given was to please not touch them- take your time, appreciate the past and enjoy the stories behind each structure"
Quaint,If u have extra time in d city n get bored of people watchingCome here for a peaceful one hr or two before flying off
AMAZING PLACE!,This was absolutely stunning and historical. It is located in a very central area that is easy to get to via metro. I would give this place at least half a day because there is so much to see and there is also another museum that lies inside of the palace. You should also go around the Hanok Village Area to rent a Hanbok to walk around the palace and neighborhood to take pictures. You can even enter the palace for free if you walk in with your Hanbok.
Must See in Seoul,Crowded but worth it. You can spend just and hour and see the highlights or go slow and spend hours just experiencing history.Go early in the day to avoid some crowds.
You should see ,"It's one of important things to see in Seoul and remember to visit the hanok village just walking distance and maybe passing to insa dong where you can buy hand crafted staff , as all 3 in same area same station stop Anguk "
Great place to have a trip,Me and my friends have decided to have a walk and see around in Seoul and that’s a place where we wanted to try The place a bit crowded and really nice to see 
Group Tour,"This a major sightseeing location and is popular. Go early! It is excellent, there are many building to see. try to get there for the spectacular Changing of the Guard all done is some amazing costumes."
Unusual Guard changing ceremony,Our visit coincided with Moon Festival so admission was free and the timing coincided with the Changing of the Guard ceremony. Very colourful and unlike any other such ceremony anywhere else. The palace itself is definitely worth a visit with a lot of interesting buildings and architecture. The area is quite large and there is also an entrance to National Folk Museum which has a very welcome cafeteria/snack bar.
Totally worth it ,We went during the Oct holidays so there was a lot of local Koreans wearing their traditional cloths The palace has a lot of buildings and is next to a museum of Korean history The buildings are very busy impressive particularly since it is in the middle of Seoul. Highly recommended 
Gyeongbokgunk Review,"Here is one of the must-visit places in Seoul. It is well organized for visitors with resting places, guidance signs and free guided tours. Dedicate at least half day. Area is quite big including several palaces for royal dynasty of Korea."
A place for the Royals,"Peaceful, serene royal and most importantly a must-see attraction in Seoul.I am not a history or touristy place visitor. I enjoy beach, quiet and easy-going places. This time me and my wife visited this Palace just to see how the look and feel of the place is. It is really a place for spending quiet time and get lost in your thoughts. The lake and structure in the middle is really something one should experience. The calmness and cool breeze even in the may-june afternoon sun does makes it relaxing. They have folk dance and song show at the palace. Coffee shop is a typical touristy place for drinks and leisure out. Overall, if you are a history-buff do visit this place.Cheers,BokaBoy"
Hanbok day,You can rent Hanbok for 1-2 hr before entrance the palace. It's free entrance fee if not you have to pay the fee(I'm not sure for the price). Near the palace have shopping street and many cafe.
Definitely a Must,"Gyeongbokgung Palace is a beautiful example of Korean architecture, albeit rebuilt. This palace is the oldest and I rate it a definite must see. This palace served as the seat of government during most of the Joseon Dynasty. Well worth a visit."
nice place for FALL,"you can go at night or morning. Both times are good. You can see colors of changing leaves in the morning. At night, they have some cultural activities. "
big. it's so big. ,"beautiful place. took me a long time to actually get there but it was great. the grounds are so pretty. standard entry is 3,000₩ (free if you wear a hanbok so you'll likely see lots of ppl running around in them which is cool) as you walk further into the palace you can see the mountains and if you look back you'll see the city which is like the most seoul thing ever.they serve tea in the library and other drinks in the cafe/souvenir shop (most upwards of 5,000₩). i finally got there at almost 11 -quite busy, the grounds are big though so getting shots without other people is possible. i put it into my itinerary as a quick morning activity and didn't end up leaving until just after noon so make the time if you're the type to want to explore every corner of a place, it really is huge. "
Must see,"A Must do if it's you're first time visiting South Korea. The palace is beautiful, Entrance fee was about 3000 won. you can also watch the changing of the royal guard ceremony. "
Amazing place! So much history!!,"This temple is the best in Seoul, SK. Entrance is only $3,000W like $3usd. There is so much to do inside the place. There is also a museum and a few other shrines. This was my favourite spot in Seoul. Make sure you go there early because it gets packed so it is tough to take pics without people around. This is a MUST."
Worth the trip,"The Gyeongbokgung Palace was worth the trip across Seoul - we walked it to get a feel for the city but you could easily take the Metro. The entrance is intricate and worth a picture in front of the gate, the palace itself is beautiful and is a good spot to sit and relax for a few minutes outside of it just to take it all in. We were there on a Sunday and there were quite a few people dressed in traditional Korean clothes, still uncertain as to why, but it added to the experience. You should allot about an hour or two to wander the grounds. "
Mediocre,This is part of the 4 main palace in Seoul. You can get a combined ticket for all the 4 palaces of else an individual ticket costs 2000 KRW. We didn't intend to go to all the 4 palaces and hence bought individual tickets. The palace itself is a bit underwhelming. We spent an hour walking around the grounds and it's alright if the weather is good. It's one of the tick the boxes attraction in Seoul and you could visit it if you feel the need to. Not missing much if you don't have the time.
Great Potential not fully realized,"This in some ways has some of the strengths of the forbidden city, without the traffic and air quality woes. Unfortunately they do not have the nice displays of palace furniture, art objects and treasures that the forbidden city has. Still impressive, but could be so much more. Perhaps these items are in other museums? If so they should be repatriated for the Korean people "
A must go place in seoul,The biggest and the oldest palace in seoul. Very nice experience for a foreign tourist to see local culture
Another day of Sightseeing,"Arrived after an interesting Subway ride, this is a vast complex take your time enjoy it. my expectation was alot higher based on the Photos I had seen previously. Still Interesting worth a visit"
 Really amazing history in middle of busy city. ," The subway takes you right to the entrance. 3000 fee to enter is amazing. If you want to rent a costume nearby for 10000 then you free entrance. Touring of actual buildings is limited, but able to see in a few. There are tours offered but we did not take one. Read that tours of the pavilion are available but must be booked via internet at least one day in advance. Wear sunblock as shade is minimal. Wear good shoes as path can be uneven. The architecture is amazing and we really enjoyed as this was our first trip to an oriental country... completely different than anything we had seen. "
Stumbled upon a gem,We were in for a pleasant surprise as we happened to come across this palace! Beautiful palace with plenty to see! Definitely recommend! We were lucky to see a concert there in the evening filled with amazing Korean music - must see!
Beautiful Palace. A must do in Seoul. ,"If you rent/wear hanbok (Korean traditional clothes) in Seoul. You can enter in any of their major Palaces for free. It's not a bad idea. And the clothes are super comfortable and beautiful. My friends and I rented our hanbok in Myeongdong area (onedayhanbok.com), then took a cab (or take the trains) to Gyeongbokgung.The palace is a huge compound of traditional Korean architecture. Take your time in walking around. "
Amazing building,"Gyeongbokgung Palace , was the main royal palace of the Joseon dynasty. Built in 1395, it is located in northen  Seoul,now National Palace  Museum of Korea and National Folk Museum  I went to Gyeongbokgung Palace in 2/9/2017.The ticket was 3000 KWN.The ticket office not crowded. The entrance is a massive open area with the palace in front of a serene mountain backdrop. Although not the original construction.It is contain 6 gates (Gwanghwamun The Main and South Gate,Heungnyemun The Second Inner Gate ,Geunjeongmun Gate,Sinmumun Gate,Geonchunmun Gate and Yeongchumun The West Gate .Moreover it contain many buildings like Gyeonghoeru ,The King's Quarters ,The Throne Hall , magnificent park ,lakes and Etc.I enjoyed In this place .But,The weather was hot when I came.You must see this Attraction."
A Palace of Old,"This palace was nice to see for historical reasons, but it is not impressive after you have seen the Forbidden City. It is similar, but smaller and less appointed. Enjoy the extras they have at different times, like shows, teas, and such."
So so,Quite a sight. Grand and beautiful. But thats it. Just a place for u to take photos. Shdnt spend more than an hour here unless you are doing a photoshoot or something. 
Historical & Amazing Architecture,"Wonderful architecture and a must to visit. Would be ideal to have a proper tour guide to show your around and understand the history of each of the structure. Part of the palace was destroyed during the world war, but they preserved what is left and they build a replica."
Nice Palace,This is o must to see in Seoul very nice Palace.. take you time to Walk around in the Palace 1.5 hour is Good
Probably the biggest and most beautiful palace complex in Seoul,"We visited here using the metro via exit 5 at Gyeongbokgung station. We first paid a short visit to the National Palace museum which had free entrance before visiting Gyeongbokgung palace. Entry fees was KRW 3000/pax. The palace complex was big and the structures were beautiful. Plenty of visitors here and many took the opportunity of posing in the Korean national costume for photos. We spent a good 2 to 3 hours walking around and taking photos. As it was autumn, some of the leaves were already changing colours. If you only have time to visit one palace in Seoul, this is it. We didn't wait around to observe the changing of the guards here."
Must Visit in Seoul,"Entering the Palace grounds is deceptive - it is really a large complex and you could spend a good deal of time exploring the buildings. You can rent a hanbok & venture into this palace, like it was Joseon period. The architectural details are beautiful. Love the to sit beside a lake & relax."
Interesting ,Offers some interesting insight on Korean history and the nobles that use to live in this palace. They have free tour guides in English.
Amazing place - Must see,"Be ready to walk a lot. The place is huge. Drinking water availabe in fountains. Went in september and weather was great. Bring cap/hat and sunscreen. The gardens are beautiful, the buildings are amazing specially the one with the lake around. Amazing photos. It will take you at least 4 hours."
One of the beautiful places I've visited.,"We went to the palace we only had an hour to be there before it closed, I suggest to go there in the first half of the day because they close 4 pm (Korean time) The price I paid is 9000KRW I've got a discount since I am a student. The place itself is beautiful but I think that it suits the best for people who are interested in historical destinations. I did enjoy the place because I learned more about unknown to me Korean culture.P.S. Everyone is very friendly"
Big area to cover with rich heritage,"The place is so big with many historical background behind it. To enjoy the site the fullest, make sure 2 things: 1) have a guide that can explain 2) rent yourself the Korean traditional clothing and take photos with it."
Beautiful place,"It is a wonderful historic site and is quite big so make sure to take water and comfy shoes. You also have free access to a museum that is inside the compound. Its a great day time activity, right in the middle of the city."
Home for a Royalty,"Breathtaking view of the metro facing the extremely old facade of Gyeongbukgung Palace is exquisitely the best. Having the mountains of Korea as the backdrop, the palace for the Crowned Prince of Korea is the place to be if you're lusty of the epic royalties of Korea. Why not to try some Hanbok for an experience of a lifetime?"
One of the Must-visit palaces in Seoul,"I've been to Korea over and over, and I always ended up here, because they always have many festivals held in the palace. It's beautiful during spring, autumn and winter. If you are wearing hanbok (Korean traditional clothe) then you get free admission to enter the palace."
Loved this palace,This is lovely and not very crowded. We took a guided tour of the garden. Would call this a must do in Seoul.
Beautiful Palace and Must See in Seoul,"It's a beautiful palace, at certain time during the day (10:00am) I believe, there is ceremony of the guard change. It's was fun to see it. The palace itself is gorgeous. We had a guide so the experience was even better because it included explanation of the history/culture. Overall I recommend it if you are in Seoul!"
A quick visit in rainy season,Sadly we visited this palace on a rainy day. So could not see all the parts of this beautiful palace. Still whatever we could see was beautiful in its own way. Its better to take a guided tour of this place just in case u want to know the historical aspects.
Great tour,Free tours in various languages are given throughout the day once you go inside. Entrance free is very cheap. 
Extraordinary,"The palace is beautiful, its architecture standsout, the guides are very informative, you can see the people in their traditional hanbok everywhere. Its a must do in SK."
Historical site,"The palace is still in good condition, and have a good view. You can see the ceremonial on guardians changing on 10am and you have chance to take a picture with the guardians. Unfortunately, there's some undermaintenance work in some area.Admission fee 3000₩/person."
Beautiful ... and very easy to access,Gyeonbokkung is a beautiful palace for which the history dates back 1395. It has been extremely well refurbished. We visited with kids and they didn't feel bored at all. The palace is easily accessible by bus or subway.
Huge,"It will take at least 2 hours to walk around this sprawling palace. Can get boring to towards the end as it is so big, so pace your visit accordingly. The central palace is really impressive, and busy. They were setting up for s[special event when visiting so didn't get to see everything. Also didn't visit the museum inside the palace grounds and fatigue was setting in."
So simple,Nothing interest in this palace on September. May be I should come back in the winter. Snow should get everything better. Just a bit disappointment.
Beautiful Palace right in the heart of Seoul!,"Interesting Palace, and good location. We were there for the changing of the Guard, and then joined the free guided tour of the palace and grounds. Very impressive and worth a visit."
only visit,"Gyeongbokgung Palace in the ancient palace in Seoul. It very easy to take MKT to the palace by drop off at Gyeongbokgung Station then walk follow the sign only 5 minutes.There will be the entrance fee if you need to experience the interior. The palace is huge and attractive if we see from the outside. When we enter to the palace, it was crowded and difficult to find nice location for our best shot.Recommend you to buy a ticket with local guide. If you buy only ticket then you would not know anything about this palace. There is no sign, no explanation then we could not get any knowledge from here.Anyway, once in Seoul Trip recommend you to have a shot with the palace."
Such a breathtaking place," You can see the pure art of Joseon Dynasty. Some stupids always said that it is quite smaller than chinese or japanese palace and nothing impressive. Yes, it is true that Gyeongbokgung is 30% smaller than Beijing palace. So what? If you want to see just big palace just go to the north korea, there is world's biggest palace(Kim il sung palace). Chinise palaces were built on the massive flat ground just to show their power to the world. Japanese palaces were built to fight against the other clans. But Korean palaces, especially Gyeongbokgung, were considerd to make a harmony with mountains and waters. When you travel some hiatorical places, I recommend you to study the background information about that place."
Beautiful ,We visited the palace on a beautiful sunny day. It was beautiful the grounds and buildings are in great condition. We saw the changing of the guards which was great to see. Lots of people there had rented 'hanbok' the traditional style dresses to walk around the palace and get some great pictures in the beautiful scenery. I felt a little under dressed without one. Would deffinatley recommend renting them from nearby as we noticed after we had been around the palace. Worth a trip here. 
I expected more,"The place is nice but it looks always the same, from the entrance to the center and surrounding . A small concert was on, and many girls were wearing typical korean old time dress, nice to see and to listen at . My young guide, a 15 yo volontaire , have been very kind . Very interesting to know that the floor heating have not been invented recently and probably not in Europe, ... no idea . "
Interesting story but as an attraction it's mediocre ,We had a great tour guide and he made the tour enjoyable but the palace was not as nice or as visually interesting as the one in Beijing. Since it was rebuilt recently it lacks the historical feel of other similar palaces. There is a lack of furniture for example in the rooms and the complex is half rebuilt.I think it's worth a visit but definitely make sure you get a guide because I don't think it's very interesting if you're just walking around. 
Cultural and Historical yet breathtaking experience,"Very Interesting to understand how the medieval koreans lived. Also it shows how well preserved the palace has been kept. Its really cool to see the inner infrastructure of the rooms and quarters that the King , Queen and the maids lived in. The palace is massive and not really recommended for elderly and disabled tourists. It is definitely worth a go if you live around the area ! Its my second time here and would love to go again !"
Excellent ,"Amazing scenery and ambience ! A must go when in Seoul and rich in history as well! Tickets for foreigners costs 3,000KRW per adult and for kids it's 2,500(I think). They are free guided tours in English , Chinese , Japanese and Korean and stipulated timings as well. Do note it closes on Tuesdays! "
Interesting,Make sure - before you visit this palace- that you know the times of the changing of the guards.Very colourful.
"Very large compound, Nice architecture, Museum at Back","Very interesting to walk around with a guide to learn about the history. Architecture and designs are nice but because this was rebuilt, it doesn't have a high level of fascination (it's basically a replica).Quickly make your way to the Museum to learn some interesting things."
Big palace!,"This palace is closed on Tuesdays and costs W3000, unless you are 65 or over in which case entry is free.A visit will last 1-2 hours depending on how much you want to see.Free guided tours in English are available at specific times. Otherwise it is self-guided. There are notices in English but not everything is explained.It is the biggest of the palaces in Seoul and has been much restored after having destroyed by fire, neglected or damaged by others during the 600 years since the oldest parts were built.The buildings are set within lovely grounds and flower beds. There are two pavilions set within ponds which are particularly scenic.Only downside is the small print in the information leaflet!The palace is next to the National Palace Museum of Korea.A must see in Seoul. Though note that many buildings are not lavishly furnished."
Must-go Palace,"Gyeongbokgung Palace is probably one of the more interesting of all in Korea. If you can, try planning to go on the last Wednesday of the month as admission to most palace and museums are free. Also, in Seoul, they do free tours. However, you need to make reservations at least 48 hours beforehand. So, make sure to do your research before visiting the country. Gyeongbokgung Palace is cool in so many aspects, particularly the guard change every hour. In addition, men can also try out guard uniforms free of charge, in which you can walk within a specific area for 5-10 mins to take pictures."
History in the Middle of the City,This Palace was a great break from a long day of walking around the city. It was great to able to walk around and take in all of the history. 
Must Visit Historical Site,"This is one of the highly recommended site to visit in Seoul. Alight at Gyeongbokgung station and only 3mins walk to the palace.We actually rented the Hanbok and managed to get free entry to the palace. (due to Korea National Day). Nonetheless, it is highly recommended for couples to rent their Hanbok across the street (10mins walk, approx USD 30 for 2 hours rental). Have fun with your photo shoot in the Hanbok. You will not regret it. Just remember to bring along your selfie stick :)"
Gyeongbokgung Palace - Lovely Palace,"The most wanted bucket list, just turn on Gyeongbokgung Palace station, the directions very clear. you can rent Hanbok cross the street (Behind the Ticket entrance), if you using Hanbook (Rp. 150.000 - Rp. 200.000 for 1 hours and half) you don't need to buy the ticket again (Free), just entrance and explore the Palace as you want, I suggest all of you come in the morning, to see the Ceremony."
"A peaceful, romantic place",It is impossible to get there and can only see from afar. But the scene here is quite peaceful and romantic
Underwhelming experience.,"Comparing to palaces of same era in China or Japan, this is for us the least exciting. The grounds are not very well kept and parts of the palace are under renovation. "
Visit Gyeongbokgung if you only have time for one palace,"Having visited both, I would recommend Gyeongbokgung over Changdeokgung. The architecture is about the same at either palace, but I personally think Gyeongbokgung's mountainous backdrop is more breathtaking than Changdeokgung's secret garden (which I thought was overrated).Try to visit during an off-peak time to avoid the crowds. I visited around 3 pm on a drizzly weekday afternoon and found the palace to be wonderfully uncrowded. The free English tour was a nice way to learn more about Korean history, but I also recommend taking the time to explore some of the more remote areas of the palace--the buildings are just as nicely restored and most people don't bother to walk that far in so it felt like I had the whole place to myself."
Amazed by its size,"At first I didn't expect too much of it, I thought it was just an ordinary palace, like the ones I visited back in my country. However, when I set foot in the palace, I knew I was wrong. The palace was historical, huge, and marvelous. It's the kind of place that you can spend half a day there just to walk around and gaze upon the beauty of it.You can also see soldier marching and try traditional Korean Hanbok there!P.S. The entrance fee will be free if you rent Hanbok there!"
Beautiful palace,My family had a great time walking around the palace wearing the traditional Korean clothes and took a lot of photos. We were quite surprised to see how many dressed up like us. The solider performance at the main gate was neat. Great gift shop/cafeteria as it provides not only a place with AC for rest/drinks but offer many well made souvenirs. We were glad that we went in the morning because it started getting too hot in the afternoon. It was disappointing that the main pond/lake was under construction.
it's huuuuge,"spare sometime if you want to throughly walk around the place. it can be overwhelming, but there's a free 30-minutes tour in english. look for schedule near the entrance from gwanghamun gate. personally i'm happy with just that, then spend more time in other palaces like changdeokgung (within walking distance from gyeongbukgung) which has prettier garden and pavilions in my opinion."
Main palace,"Probably the main palace in Seoul, very cheap entrance fees, large palace to go around, possibility to visit the seoul folk museum nearby for free"
Interesting,I like to visit this place again to get a good feel of the Korean culture. A must see to visit and experience. 
Go at night - reserve tickets online,"A must see for any tourist visiting Seoul. During the summer I recommend visiting the palace at night. You will need to make a reservation online (you'll find how to do that on their website royalpalace.go.kr), it's worth it. The views of the palace and the surrounding area are more scenic at night and the humid/hot summer weather is more bearable."
Very historical palace!,"It was really great! The palace was very big, and I love the architecture inside the palace. Worth every penny. But, the palace a little bit crowded when you came on weekend."
Pretty but hard to engage with,"We arrived expecting splendour in a Korean style. The buildings, of which many are restored recently, are very pretty and the setting is beautiful. But you can't enter almost all the buildings and apart from a big sign at each building there's little to provide an engaging context for grown ups and kids alike.Might have worked better if framed as a pretty stroll rather than a history/culture site. Also, the place is quite exposed so if you go on a sunny day with steering heat and small kids in tow I'd advise late afternoon."
Great History lesson,When touring Korea there are a lot of historical shrines and palaces to visit. If you only do one this is the one. Allow a couple of hours as it is extremely large and there is a lot to see. The authorities are continually restoring the palace and it is in great condition The entry fee is only a few dollars and well worthwhileEnglish speaking guides are availableWhile we missed it apparently the changing of the guards is a highlightThe palace is also within walking distance to the Bukchon Hanoi village as well
Rich history and cultural heritage ,"It was a great experience - learning about the rich history and culture, and different dynasties in Korea's history such as Goryeo to Joseon periods, understanding the early Chinese & Japanese influence and development of the Korean alphabet and language. It all helps to someone like me who also appreciate Korean period dramas. The changing of guards performance was colorful and interesting. It's a huge place so alot of walking is required. I was glad that the weather was perfect that morning - cool and slightly windy. I also made the right decision to join a guided tour and was rewarded with a pleasant and patient tour guide who not only speaks English well but has a great understanding of Korean history. All said, I had enjoyed the tour tremendously and would certainly recommend it ! "
Grand Gyeonbokgung,"Huge palace! One of the bigger tourist-draws, so it's often more crowded than a lot of the other palaces. They give free tours in English (and some other languages) at set times throughout the day, which are fun but a bit slow. (My guide was really nice, there's just a lot of extra time given for people to take pictures at each building.)If you're interested in the surrounding museums (which I've heard great things about) or specific on-site attractions, like the library or the gardens, call ahead as they have separate hours than the Palace."
Vintage Korean Tourist Place,"I love Korea, love Seoul and Gyeongbokgung Palace. We could hire a hanbok and wore to take pictures with local guards and local citizens or even other tourists. Must visit place in Seoul xx"
Worth a trip,Great piece of history in a modern city! Many locals visit in traditional dress and interesting to see the changing of the guards.
Really worth a visit to this historical palace ,"Beautiful architect of the historical royal palace. The place is accessible by Seoul Metro and admission fee is just 3000 won (U$2.7). I found some visitors (foreign and local) hiring hanbok to dress themselves as traditional Koreans, especially popular among ladies. There are a few shops nearby offering the Hanbok rental at a price as low as 5000 won. It will take about 1.5-2 hours walk around the palace. "
Vast array of well preserved palace buildings,"Similar in style to other Seoul palaces, Gyeongbokgung differs in size and the extensive complex of palace buildings and compounds. There is much to see here so it is best to allow at least two hours to explore. I recommend entering through the main gate and exiting at the rear of the grounds to ensure you don't miss the beautiful book room and final home complex of the revered empress. The walk back from the rear of the grounds takes you past a number of small art galleries. Avoid the weekend if possible as there are many tour groups."
Great historic visit,Great place to get sense on Korean history and architecture.I recommend this to all families that are interested in Korean history 
It's a must !!,"Very nice place in the middle of the city. It is a well preserved and maintained piece of history. There are lots of tourists here, but due to the size it's still nice."
Love it,be prepared to walk a lot. Its beautiful palace with rich history. I really enjoyed it. It could get hot so do carry umbrella 
Most striking palace to learn about Korean history,"A visit to Gyeongbokgung Palace is one of those things you do in a lifetime that stick in your memory for the rest of your life. What a stunning palace and what an amazing opportunity for anyone to learn so much about a country's history that no school would ever teach. Visiting this palace was one of the best things I have ever done for myself. This visit made me realize just how little we learn about Asian history in the West and I lamented this but welcomed and enjoyed the opportunity to remedy this sad reality at least a little by learning as much as I could. I was so impressed by the meticulous care of this historical place. Authorities in Seoul ought to be applauded for their exceptional care of this historical jewel. This is not a place you can visit in just an hour or two. Take your time! See all the details, read everything, learn and enjoy! It'll transport you to ancient times long gone and to such a different culture and world you could never imagine unless you went there yourself. We spent an entire day here and loved everything, from the unique and delicate gardens, to the royal chambers of the king, the superb collections of antiques that show different times in Korean history. The pagodas are exquisite, the details of the architecture, even the small village of their servants provided a clear contrast that showed how differently their servants lived within the palace. We also marveled at the great contrast between this ancient structure next The the modern city surrounding it. Absolutely magnificent!"
Very interesting,"Everything is very interesting in Korea, it is not colorful like in Japan or China but still worth to see it. Do not forget to take umbrella as in June / July rains a lot!"
Beautiful palace,This is a must visit when you are in Seoul. One of the biggest palaces in the city. You can really feel and smell the ancient history of Korea. 
Mistakenly going at night = Magical,"My husband and I actually went to see Gwanghwamun Gate (The main gate to the palace) under the night lights not realising the palace was open at night. After a couple photo's at the front we tentatively walked in and joined the short que for a ticket.It wasn't that crowded to begin with and we were close to the front of the line when the gates opened. If your ever in the same position when the gates open, don't follow the crowd and walk straight. Walk to the left and through a side door. That was where the magic started for us. as it slowly got darker and the palace just became magical, the only thing that could have enhanced it is with fireflies (not possible, but it does let your imagination go.) After that it becomes harder to fully enjoy the palace with so many people and children. So many people looking for the perfect selfie in front of everything. We went again to the first area at the end of our trek around the palace, but the magic was lost with the shear number of people there.People forget about the history of the palace and what it has seen, it became a beautiful scene to take selfies before moving to the next beautiful scene. Not to say we didn't take any selfies, but we took a moment to read what little english text there was and to just imagine what it was like in that era."
Great palace to visit in Seoul. Highly recommend,"This was our favorite palace to visit during the trip. It is the restored main royal palace of the Joseon Dynasty. The architecture was awesome. Enjoyed walking through the various areas. Takes you back in history and people dressed in tradition dress added to the experience. There is also a museum. The palace museum and front area where the changing of the guards happens are free. However, to get into the main palace grounds there is an admission charge. Ticket was only 3,000 KRW when we were there."
Beautiful,"A really beautiful place. I wish we had more time there as we were with a tour company and they were rushing us a bit. However, we were lucky to catch to the changing of the guard ceremony - really took you back in time... Not only is it beautiful to see the grounds, the gardens and the buildings but how interactive it is - you could dress up in traditional hanbok and walk around. We didn't do it because it would have been too hot but I can only imagine how that could help you feel, imagine what it may have been like once a upon a time... in some areas of the palace in the village area there were rooms where one could actually nap like they did back then. You take your shoes off and lay down on the floor and nap! So cool! I would love to go back when cooler and try the full experience."
A must see in Seoul,"If you like to know more about the old Korean Kingdom and see historical buildings, this is a place you should not miss. It is located in the city centre and it is advisable to take metro to go there because, if you drive there, you would have difficulty to park you car. Since the National Folklore Museum is just next door, you may wish to visit both the palace and the museum in one go. As the area is fairly large, please be prepared to allow at least a half day for this visit. "
Great palace with changing of the guard,We visited the palace in April and had a great time. The palace is beautiful and huge! We didn't take a tour so we just wandered around at our own pace. It was awesome getting to watch the changing of the guard ceremony. It takes place several times throughout the day. Don't miss it!
Escape the City for a Peaceful Tour,"Gyeongbokgung Palace is reminiscent of Central Park in that it is situated in the middle of an enormous, loud city but allows for a level of peace and solitude that you wouldn't expect to find. Having been built originally in the 1300s, the palace is a shell of it;'s original self having been destroyed by the Japanese hundreds of years later. That being said, the majority of the building have likely been rebuilt but their beauty and attention to detail are remarkable. A must see while in Seoul."
an amazing historical palace ,"among all the place I visited in Korea, this is the place I love the most. A great historical Palace which very beautiful and well maintained."
Had Fun Doing Anniversary Photoshoot ,Dressed in hanbok at the Gyeongbokgung to commemorate our wood anniversary #5thanniversary! Thank you #seohwahanbok for the glamorous hankok and memorable photos....! ❤❤ So much fun to join in the local youngsters in this #newtrend during springbreak and take group pictures with them!
Great Place to Learn About History,We visited here and took an English tour. It's really worth you time to see and hear about the history of Place and Kings in Korea. 
"Super beautiful, but be prepared for the heat!!","I really enjoyed going to Gyeongbokgung. I actually met up with a friend there that I had met on a language exchange app but never met in real life, and we had so much fun! Because that friend insisted on paying for my ticket for me, I don't actually know how much it costs. But I found out from people there that if you go to one of the Hanbok (traditional Korean clothing) stores nearby and pay to rent Hanbok (which you can do, prices vary depending on the outfit you choose and how long you want to borrow it, I borrowed the ""cheap"" outfit for 2 hours and it was 20,000 Won (~$20)) you can enter the palace for free. So it was quite cool, as we walked around the palace, there were people everywhere wearing the traditional Korean palace clothing! Bless their hearts though, that day was HOT. If you come to the palace in the summer, be prepared for that... I was not... lol. Overall it's a gorgeous place to visit and a lovely walk during the day. There's a mini museum/cafe/information center/gift shop near the main building of the palace, so you can go there and enjoy some A/C if you're dying in the heat (like I was). There are also a lot of cute cafes and restaurants nearby that you can go to, with delicious food! Overall, I would recommend visiting this palace, but it's more fun if you go with a friend or a group for sure. :)"
My eyes was busy capturing the scenery,The palace is incredably huge. (TIPS) We went to the hanbok rental and got free entry ticket because we use hanbok. People were staring at our group (8 of us walking together with hanbok) but hey we got to take good pictures in hanbok as well. The entrance to the center part is quite the same. Don't take to much time taking picture outside as the inside parts have less people around. Don't forget to come in to the lake. It was beautiful and breathtakingly pretty.
The palace with a lot of rebuilt items,The palace was one of the palaces lived by the king of Korea. It is a much smaller version of Forbidden City of China. The palace has been somewhat destroyed by Japanese in past. Several areas of the palace are rebuilt just few years ago. 
Beautiful gardens,"The Gyeongbokgung Palace, or the Northern Palace is a sprawling place with beautiful gardens surrounding it. We were fortunate to come on a pleasant August day where people were dressed in traditional clothing (hanbok) and taking photos together. A very nice day out. Don't miss the Museum right next door."
Beautiful Palace,My son and I enjoyed every corner of this Gyeongbokgung Palace. On our 1st visit we arrived 30mins before closing and missed opportunity to tour through the majority of the palace complexes. We loved it so much and decided to return next day for 10:30am for English Tour Guide through Secret Garden. It was worth it.
Enjoyable day out - free guided tour and changing of the palace guards,"Taken on a English language guided tour of the palace. The length of tour was about 60 minutes. The tour guide was knowledgeable and engaging. The guide whizzed us through the various parts of the palace and gave us a taste of the live of the King and Queen. After the tour, we retraced the path to truly enjoy the beauty of the palace. All in all, we spent 90 minutes to 2 hrs at Gyeongbokgung.Oh, yes, the to guided tour is free and you can find out the tour schedule online.Changing of the palace guard. The 15 minute ceremony was colourful, enjoyable and full of aplomb. A strategic location to site yourself is on the west side of the viewing area - the guards will march in from the East Gate and turn towards the South Gate."
Beautiful Gyonbokgung palace,"Beautiful palace, very large, cheap entry fee, lovely views and gardens, very peaceful. Convenient entry from metro station."
Take a tour! Or just wander. ,"I enjoyed learning about dynasties, intrigues in the palace and architecture. Secret Garden tour is beautiful and interesting as well. "
Great Place,"very nice grounds, love these types of places. if you like history, then you must visit the palace. k?"
Beautiful Palace,We had a great time strolling around the grounds of the palace. Lots of nice pmaces to pise for a pucture. Fun to people watch as people rent Korean dress when visiting the palace. Very nice gift shop too.
Once you see one...,"Similar to the other palaces, just bigger and a little more elaborate. Doesn't compare to the palaces in Forbidden City.We had volunteer staff give us a tour. Exhibit information at points of interest would have been helpful."
Rent a hanbok and entrance will be free,"Rented a handbook for 2 hrs for 10,000won. From a shop just across the road. Rented the cheapest so the design was much simpler than the more expensive ones at 30,000won. Both female and male handbook available.Once you wear a handbook, entrance is free!!! Great time to photo shoot. Even locals wanted a picture with us may be because we were wearing our hijab with the Hanbok. The weather was hot and we were perspiring a lot in that thick and heavy hanbok. Bring your bottle of water along coz there isn't any shops inside the palace. The palace is so huge, took us 2 hours to explore most of it. Taking into account our endless.phototaking hahaha.There's the exterior part, with a beautiful pond and am.overview of the mountain at the back."
Gyeongbokgung palace is the one of the beautiful palaces in Seoul!,"It was really amazing to visit such a beautiful place in the middle of the city Seoul. I thought it was really interesting how both traditional and modern life coexist together in a city. The traditional clothes, Hanbok, that everyone wore are so pretty and I am sad that I didn't know much about the rental information. Maybe I should try next time.It is a must visit place and you won't regret!"
Amazing Palace: Must See in Seoul,Step back into time and walk the massive palace grounds right in the middle of Seoul. See the secret island where the king relaxed with his lady. Take pictures in front of the party pavilion. See the magnificent throne room View the building where hangul was invented.
Excellent free tour,"The palace is very interesting, but also very crowded. The changing of the guard was pretty spectacular.Make sure you register for the free tour of the palace! Our guide was a young lady who spoke very good English and offered a lot of interesting information about the palace and about Korea. It was a very pleasant experience."
Beautiful,We wandered round by ourselves and really enjoyed the tranquillity in this massive complex. A must do on your 1st trip to Seoul to appreciate the development of Korea as a nation
amazing and magic place,It is an amazing place....just the peace and the beauty in the middle of the city. It is worth it to visit
Nice palace,"قصر جميل جدا ويجب الذهاب له ، قبل القصر يوجد متحف مجاني الدخول ، كثير من الزوار يلبسون الهانبوك والزي التقليدي لأخذ الصور فيه ولأنك ان لبسته فالدخول للقصر مجاني Beautiful palace, although we miss the show when the guards martch with music? We came last second, it keeps showing but wasn't sure every what, You can enter free if you dress in tradition oitfit which places near provide them for rent."
A very nice palace,"This is a very nice palace. The further back you go, the less crowded it gets. Loved the changing of the guards. Like a little Forbidden City with its layout."
Like a step back in time ,This is one of the must see sites in Seoul. There are guards out the front who do a kind of changing of the guard. Inside you have a few palaces with descriptions of each one. With both locals and tourists dressed in local hanbuk clothes it makes this place feel like a step back in time and from a historical Korean tv show. Nice pavilion on a lake in the middle. Takes around an hour to walk around. Worth seeing. 
"A beautiful, peaceful and tranquil historical place","It is an excellent place to see and take many photos with beautiful royal scenery behind, especially wearing the historical hanbok and wearing the hanbok can enter the royal palace without fee. We entered from the North gate and started to take pictures in front of the halls, corriders, gardens, ... within the four hours rental period and visited the Korean Culture Gallery where we knew bit by bit the Korean culture systematically. We were lucky that we could watch the royal parade around noon time."
Worth it,A good reconstruction of an ancient palace. Extensive building and forecourt The loos in the museum are good too 
Very interesting history,There is a lot to see at this Palace. It is like a palace and the forbidden city rolled into one. The changing of the guard is really worth looking at. It is interesting to hear the history of the palace though I would not want to be around during when it was occupied.
It's okay but don't spend too much time here.,It's as the title says. I think it's something that is worth the visit but there are nicer palaces to be seen.
Good cultural experience,"Gyeongbukgong Palace was the main royal palace of the Joseon dynasty, which already makes it worth a visit. The palace is quite big, and is a good cultural experience as you get to walk around palace grounds and learn more about Korean history."
Great palace to visit; Changing of the guard was the highlight!,"We were in Seoul on a family vacation and wanted to see one palace rather than visiting multiple ones. We were told that this one is the biggest palace and it happened to be very close to our hotel (the wonderful Four Seasons Seoul). So we ended up walking (which was so convenient). We loved seeing the changing of the guard. The costumes, the drums, the ceremony - it was all wonderfully memorable, dramatic and enjoyable. We loved seeing various visitors dressed in traditional Korean attire. Afterwards, we walked around the vast palace. There's a roped off area that you need to purchase tickets in advance to enter (we didn't know that, which was kind of a bummer, as we would have liked to go into that part of the palace).Overall, we're glad that we went to this palace, since we only had time to visit one while in Seoul. Nearby there is a historic street that shows Korean streets as they looked in the past. Also nearby is the folk museum but unfortunately we didn't have time to go there."
Beautiful Palace,"The Palace grounds are huge, there is a lot to see. Many of the areas are open for pictures. The museum was the best part I enjoyed as well as the show in the court yard. "
"ITS AMAZING, YOU FEEL LIKE YOUR INTO KOREAN DRAMA","One of the best place i ever went, it really exceeded my expectation, as im a fan of korean drama. Plus wearing there traditional Hanbok it makes you feel that your in Joseon Dynasty Era."
City tour,"Interesting place. Extensive walking, so be prepared. If it's hot, be sure to have water. Changing of the guard ceremony is interesting & colorful."
Main Palace - worthy of a visit,"We purchased the Palace Combo pass which included entry to all 4 palaces plus Jongmyo Shrine. This Palace is huge and requires at least half a day to see it all. There are changing of the guard ceremonies on several times throughout the day and also a chance to dress in traditional costumes. There is a tea house in the far back corner of the Palace grounds and a cafe inside the Folk Museum (which is worthy of your time), but apart from that, not many options for food/drink. Gardens are extensive. Take plenty of water."
"wonderful, expansive and convenient to all things seoul","This palace is centrally located, beautiful both day and night, accessible to all. The history is fantastic and you should check out the museum next door as well."
Lovely Palace,"We spent a Sunday afternoon visiting the palace on an English guided tour. The tour lasted around an hour and towards the end we decided to break away from the Group as we had seen as much as we wanted to see. We found the Palace interesting in terms of its history and the tour, buildings, artwork, decorations made the visit worthwhile despite it being very hot, humid and wet."
I was not impressed,"It is a large complex, like a big park, with several buildings. You need at least 2 hours to go through them all and in the severe heat of the summer, it is quite exhausting. The buildings all look more or less alike. The main building is supposed to be the Gyoenghoeru Pavillion, which is not impressive. Very little or no information is given, at least not in English, which is shameful. However, this is the largest palace in Seoul and the complex is the most important tourist attraction ao it is a must see."
Beautiful Afternoon,"It would take at least a couple of hours on a moderate pace to go around the complex. It also makes one think how patriotic the South Koreans are, looking at groups and families whiling away a beautiful afternoon in the rain."
Massive,"Massive-would be my first reaction to this place. It is a place that you should visit in Seoul to appreciate some histories, traditional Korean architecture and garden. There were a lot of tourists there but the place is so spread out so you won't feel that it's too cramped in there. ( at least the day I was there ). Prepare to spend about 2 hours if you would like to walk it all. There is locker area near the main gate but I recommend taking your belonging with you because there are other gates that you can exit as you walk deeper into the property. And from those gate you can easily walk to other attractions. In summer, bring along umbrella and water."
Best Palace!!,"Lots to see. People in native dress. Opportunities to rent native dress. Many buildings and beautiful grounds. Very highly recommend, it was an amazing place!"
Beautiful palace with lots of history,This ia must see as it contains lots of history and beautiful Korean architecture. You will need to spend minimum half a day here to even just do most of the area. Longer if you want to go into the details.
Beautiful Palace,The palace is huge and rather amazing that is located in the middle of a bustling city. One can feel the history and culture by just being there. Worth the visit.
Try the evening viewings,"The palace is one of the must visit sites for tourist coming to Seoul. To get the full traditional Korean experience, you can rent Hanbok (traditional Korean clothing) from many stores near the palace. During the summer, I recommend visiting the palace at night. You'll need to make reservation online, but the hassle is worth it. The views are much more scenic at night and the summer heat become more bearable (especially if you are wearing Hanbok)."
Gyeongbok gung,One of the best place in Korea.Hire Hanbok so that you don't have to buy ticket!!I had a really great time here! 
A great place to spend half a day!,"Seoul is definitely not all about just shopping! I went to Seoul for a Year-end holiday with 2 friends and we decided to visit Gyeongbokgung on the first day of 2017. It was a very grand palace with very nice scenery! We took our time to slowly walk around, embracing ourselves in the cultural air. There were many tourists too, well, in fact, a bit too many! It was rather difficult to take any photos without some people ""photo-bombing"" our photos! Well, I guess that can't be helped! Anyway I love watching some ladies wearing the traditional hanboks and taking photos. When we realised that we can rent hanbok, my friend went to rent one immediately and we had fun taking photos and having fun! I would strongly recommend to visit this Palace if you have time in Seoul."
Visit Changdeokgung Palace instead.,"Gyeongbokgung Palace is LARGE! very, very large. the grounds go on forever and it's size and history is fasinating. They also have fantastic free tour guides that you can book online. However I would probably recommend visiting Changdeokgung Palace instead. Most of Gyeongbokgung Palace was destroyed during the war and is being restored from the ground up to resemble what it would have been like ""back in the day"" so to me it felt a little bit like walking through a theme park. Changdeokgung Palace on the other hand is a world heritage listed site and maintains a lot of it's original structures, it also has a wonderful garden ""secret garden"" that is a favourite for many Seoulites. "
Palace,Great museum and Hongboks are a must. Go across the road and deck the kids with hongboks and do the tour. Changing of the guard is interesting.
Nice spot in the heart of the city ,Very easy to get to and very reasonable entrance fee. I went to see the changing of the guard...which got rained out but it's a nice place to see history in the heart of the city. 
Well worth to visit it!,"The imperial palace in Seoul down town is the last witness of the Korean story, in fact most of historical building were destroyed during Second World War.Well preserved, the building has more similarity with Forbidden city ad exception to color of the roof (bue in Korea and red in Cina) and the symbol of the Korean Imperator Family.Inside to the palace there is the national museum where is summarized the Korean story.At the end of the visit there is the Blue Roof Palace where the president of Republic of south of Korea live. "
"If you like really cool, giant temples this is for you",I will say it being located right in the middle of the city threw me off a little bit but this was a must stop for anyone going to Seoul.
Iconic,"Gyeongbokgung Palace is one of the most iconic sights in all of Korea because of its long and storied history. Completed in 1395 at the beginning of the Joseon Dynasty. It's is the largest and the most scenic because with Mount Bugaksan and Mount Namsan. Free guided tours in English at 1100, 1300 and 1500. Don't miss the Changing of the Guard Ceremony at 1000 and 1300. Entrance Fee is 3,000 won. Do expect at least 1-2 hours to roam around the compound. The National Palace Museum of Korea is located South of Heungnyemun Gate and National Folk Museum is located on the eastern side. You can reach the Palace by taking Subway Line 3 to Gyeongbokgung Station Exit 5 or Line 3 Anguk Station Exit 1. "
A beautiful Palace by the US Embassy Seoul,"Wonderful Palace with nominal entrance fee., free cultural shows daily . on the orange metro line #3, close to Us Embassy, city hall and other palaces and museums "
Beautiful Place,A beautiful and colorful place that I wished to discover since long time ago!! Got back in the korean History
Grand but empty,"This was very disappointing and says a lot about major sights in Korea and China. Extremely grand and a wonderful photo opportunity as you will see many people using it. Unfortunately there is no content or real history here. The temple is completely gutted and the buildings become very samey, very quickly.A nice walk but not much to see or learn here."
Beautiful palace,"It was quite hot when we visited the palace. The sun was very glaring when we stood there watching the changing of guards parade. But it was interesting. The palace is very big, very nice structures. We are a group of 10 people so can get cheaper entrance rates. Those who wear hanbok, (the korean costume) think can enter free of charge. Nice to see people wearing hanbok at the palace."
Royal palace..,This is one of the largest palaces in seoul..you can rent a hanbok the traditional costume of Koreans while you are sightseeing..very beautiful place.. definitely recommend it
Wow! What a beauty,"This palace is extraordinary! What a beauty. I was amazed how big this place is when I got in. There's a lot to see. I'm Korean, so I'm very proud at the fact that my ancestors built this palace. It's definitely a must see when you are in Seoul. Don't leave without seeing this place!"
If Your Time is Limited... This is the Attraction 4 U,"I often travel to The Philippines and have at least an 8-hour layover in Seoul. This gives me limited time to grab a bus into the city, eat and check out the sites. Gyeongbokgung Palace is a terrific site to behold. From the guards out front dressed in the style of a bygone era to the magnificent architecture of the buildings. Thank goodness for digital photography, because you will definitely have many photos opportunities here. I recommend that anyone like me who might have limited site-seeing time to stop here first, as this is the Korea you really need to see. Enjoy."
Not as impressive as other palaces around the world ,Not worth your time if you don't have that much time in Seoul. It is a replica most of the palace stuff have been reproduced.
Excellent visit ,Spent half a day visiting the whole palace. The biggest palace and we thoroughly Enjoyed our visit 
A symbolic of city of Seoul,"The Palace is a must be place for being in Seoul and it is massive. Because it is so vast somehow you felt it is a bit ""empty"". However, I love the mixture of old and new all in one city and within walking distance, there are many attractions to explore in the surrounding areas."
Dont miss the palace,Beautiful to just walk around here and take photos next to the buildings. The entrance fee was cheap.
Not to be Missed,"Amazing palace grounds with a vaierty of temples, which reminded me of a smaller version of the Forbidden City in Beijing. Tip: Get there when it opens at 9: no crowds and the weather cooler."
Beautiful,"I really enjoyed my time in this beautiful place. Entrance fee is 3000 kwn, if you want you can get a free English tour (11.am., 3.30pm) There are also Korean national dresses for rent, you can rent it out and stay your visit wearing this dress. It reminds me at some point forbidden city in Beijing but with way more greenery, beautiful ponds, less people and way more space. If you like museums don't forget to pass by national folk museum, it's right next to the palace."
not over interesting,"Found it to be only soso ,all looked the same and there is nothing in the buildings,though the muesum is very good"
Beautiful palace to start to off your day in Seoul,"My brother and I arrived at the gates of Gyeongbokgung Palace, on a sunny December morning. Exhausted from our debate on how to properly pronounce 'Gyeongbokgung', we were instantly silenced upon being greeted by two stone sculptures. Was it a hairless lion, or a mythical beast? Something to debate as we explored the palace further. Royal Guards dressed in traditional uniforms, swarmed in as we walked through one of three large red doors. Their spears pierced the heavens as they marched towards us in a ceremonial fashion. It was an amazing transition from the busy, modern streets behind the red gates of the palace; like stepping back in time. Alarmed at first, we were relieved to learn it was only the opening of the palace gates that we nearly interrupted. After a pleasant ceremony feature, we proceeded through the massive courtyard, at the entrance, to the ticket booths. The ground was soft. The sand filling the courtyard was fine and yellowish orange in colour. I was fascinated by how comfortable it was to walk on it. I dimwittedly thought there was nothing more to the palace, beyond the courtyard. That was until we advanced further in through the palace's second second gates. We spent 2.5 hours wandering the grounds of Gyeongbokgung Palace, discovering amazing detail in architecture, beautiful natural scenery, and a taste of Korea's history and culture through the people we encountered an learning about the demolition and restoration of the palace.It was not too busy, but if you are trying to capture tourist free photos, you may have to be patient for the perfect moment :D I enjoyed viewing the city, which towered over the walls of the palace, from within the center of the palace. It was an exciting place to be; almost like viewing the future while standing in the past. If you are Palace, Temple, Castle, etc. hoping throughout East Asia, do not miss this palace. There is also plenty to see and do around the palace if you have time to spare in Seoul."
A must visit,Stunning Historical Place. Absolutely beautiful. Highly recommended. you will spend at least 2-3 hours in this palace. Make sure you wear comfortable shoes.
If you only see one palace...,"We lived in Seoul for two years but this was always the palace we took guests too! It's location, museums, buildings, and ease of use make it the best to see. You can walk from the main entrance all the way through to the back and view the president's house. They have wonderful exhibits, it looks awesome in any season, and twice a year they have it open in the evenings with special light exhibits. Make sure to buy the 500w guidebook at least once because it contains excellent information to read as you walk around! The pagoda at the back of the grounds is my favorite and looks so cool with the changing seasons!"
Beautiful palace and palace grounds,Wonderful opportunity to experience a piece of history in the heart of Seoul! Very popular destination. Be prepared to stay for a few hours to really enjoy the amazing architecture and nature that grace the area. Also check for current opening and closing times before you head out. 
Impressibe,Just what's it says it is. A large palace with interesting architecture. Be sure to time your visit for the changing of the guard 
Palace visit at night,It is well worth it to visit the palace for the night opening. The lighting and the atmosphere are very beautiful.Make sure you bring your passport or id to get the reduced entry fee.
Number one to visit in Seoul,"I had only one day in Seoul that time and I wanted to visit something, which represents the city and Korean culture. I chose the Gyeongbokgug Palace. I was lucky as they have free entrance on the last Wednesday of the month. It was a nice surprise! The palace is magnigicent! Of course, it is better to know more about it history, but even if you don't, it is a nice place to walk and discover, to forget all the troubles and just walk and enjoy the beauty of pavillions. There were many young people in national dresses, it gives this place even more magic and brings you somewhere centuries ago."
Informative and eye opening,We were lucky to have met the ICI youth Cultural Corp volunteer. They provided us with a afternoon of informative tour of the palace. And all the information and friendliness are for free!! 
Stunning Historical Place! The Must Visit in Seoul!,"Paying only 3,000 KRW each for entrance fee and you will be able to explore such a great palace -- free of charge when you are dressed in traditional Hanbok. All manmade architecture and decoration are well-presented! Soldier marching is interesting! Folk Village with performance inside is awesome! The most outstanding place to stop over before heading to other places!"
Absolutely beautiful!,"I had a wonderful time at the Gyeongbokgung palace.Korean history is absolutely fascinating! You can see the influence of Confucianism in the architecture and aesthetics, but the Gyeongbokgung palace is a testimony to the fact that simplicity is both powerful and beautiful!The ceremony of changing of guards is definitely recommended!"
Best seen after visiting the museum,"There's a lot to see around this palace. Unfortunately, the lovely pavilion on the water can only be visited with a guided tour that must be booked online in advance. And the other temple on a lake was shut down for pond cleaning. What is visible is very interesting. The changing of the guard ceremony is fun for kids, but a bit hokey."
Fun Experience in this Historical Place,"We went with Hanbok, and have a nice experience in this historical palace. The architecture is nice, with some guard in the traditional wear patrolling the palace. Overall it was an enjoyable experience. PS: entrance is free for anyone in Hanbok."
Must see if in Seoul!,"A personal favorite of all the palaces. It was pouring with rain the day we went, and it still did not disappoint. Lovely gardens and architecture, with the mountains in the background."
Great place to visit. Go during the Change of Guard timings,"I enjoy my visit to this palace. You need to get an excellent guide to orientate you around the palace or else everything doesn't really make sense and all you see are just buildings and more buildings. I had a great Korean guide, June who made the tour enjoyable. She even point to us minor details that tourists fail to see.It used to be really grand and there, you will see a portrait of it being even more majestic than before. Sadly, majority of the buildings were destroyed during the Japanese Invasion. Restorations are still taking place.The fun part is the changing of guard ceremony. I think it's a normal ritual in every palace but since we are living in modern time, it's quite fascinating. You can take photos with the guides too.If you know Feng Shui, I was told that this palace was deliberately built around 4 mountains. The mountain behind the palace was Bukhansan, a very beautiful mountain!I enjoy this visit. Love the pictures!"
Hassle-free!,"When you visit Gyeongbokgung Palace and decided to rent Hanbok before entering, congrats! Your admission to the palace will be free! The palace is so big and well preserved. It is also a great place to observe the changing of guards and experience their traditional costume. So close to their national museum and bukchon village."
The place where you must visit,"No matter you are korean or foreigner, I strongly recommend to visit this place if you are in seoul. You can see the beauty of korean traditional architecture. Also, you can borrow a pair of korean traditional clothes(hanbok) near here. so, it will be memorable experience to walking around here with hanbok."
Nice palace,"Most palaces are closed on Mondays, but this one is open Mondays (closed on Tuesdays), so as it was Monday, this is where we decided to go. We timed our visit to coincide with the free English tour along with 50 or so other English-speaking tourists. Luckily, our hanbok-clad tour guide came equipped with a microphone and speaker system so all could hear.Our tour guide started by explaining the history of the palace. The tour then continued passed the Geunjeongjeon Throne Hall, the Gyeonghoeru Pavilion party building, Gangnyeonjeon Hall where the king slept, the queen’s gardens behind Gyotaejeon Hall (queen’s residence), the decorative chimney of the Jagyeongjeon Hall (king’s mother’s residence) and finally to Hyangwonjeon Pavilion (currently under renovation and could only be photographed by holding your camera above the fence — if you’re tall enough). The tour took approx. one hour and was well worth doing.The palace complex was moderately busy and there were many people visiting wearing hanboks. There are many hanbok rental places around the palace. Entry is free when you're in hanbok."
Royal,"The Gyeongbokgung Palace is one of the most visited palace in Seoul mainly because it is the main royal palace during the Joseon Dynasty. It brings you back to the old Seoul amidst the highly urbanized backdrop outside the palace. For an added cultural experience, there is a Changing of the Royal Guards ceremony at 10 am and 2 in the afternoon. You also get to try the royal guard costume. "
Must see in Seoul,The place is awesome! Try to discover when it will be the change of the guard. It happens once at the morning and once at the afternoon. Just in the main entrance of the palace. You must see to learn about some history of Korea. The public transportation in Seoul is cheap and you can visited any place in this city! There are other atractions near by.
Wearing hanbok in 경복궁!,"I used to live in Seoul for almost 3 years, and have visited 경복궁 for more than 10 times I guess. But this is my first time to wear hanbok(한복) to get into 경복궁, then it'll be free for the fee, what a nice and a special experience over there!"
Large complex. A great place for a leisurely walk,"We were on a ship's tour with this Palace as one of the stops. Amazing to see all the different buildings and the way the Korean Royalty lived. Many young people come, dressed in traditional garb to enjoy the day here. Adds authenticity to the viewing of the buildings and grounds."
Quite and yet beautiful,Place to see in Seoul quite and beautiful Temples are simple and in line with Korean culture with style and harmony 
Amazing historical place,"It is a must for anyone to visit while in the Seoul. I visted with the pre-organised guided tour, purchsed at viator.com. It included the visit to palace , information about it and plenty of free time to look around and take images."
Interesting Castle,Was rainy when I went so the views weren't the greatest. However the compound inside the castle is very well kept.
Good Value,Lots to see. You can stroll at your own pace. Changing of the guard is interesting and the price is outstanding.
Majestic palace,"This is the only palace i have visited during my short korea trip. Reached there at 10am to see the guard changing ceremony. After the short ceremony, we signed up for about 15min free trying of royal guard uniforms at the left side of the gate. Took some photos in the uniforms around the gwanghwamun gate. Palace is very beautiful and huge. We could connect with the various sections of the palace that appeared in korean drama. It's uniquely korean to see many visitors in hanbok walking in the palace despite hot summer. Definitely a must-see place."
Pretty But Repetitive,"It is my humble opinion that you only need to see one palace in Seoul, and this is not the one you should see. Perhaps I was underwhelmed as it was our second palace of the day, but I kind of felt like I was at exactly the same place I had visited earlier that day even though it was a different palace and a new entry fee (admittedly very affordable). "
It is not only a palace but also a beautiful park with lot of visitors,"Was there last Sunday. Spent about 3 hours there and only did see a part of the whole thing. Have to visit again. A perfect place for photographers, as many people enter the area in old costumes in return for free entry and to be photographed by other tourists. The whole area is very picturesque and with many people in the costumes this is perfect for photographers. "
"Nice, but there are better palaces....",We prefered the Changgyeonggung palace over this one. Because everyone goes here making it bussier. Also the grounds and buildings are not as beautiful as in the other palace. The changing of the guards felt like a themepark schtick with fake goatees and everything. It has some impressive buildings but it did not make a lasting impression on us.
History,"Nice to see, shows but bring cash If you want to se the Hole area. Good food in the restaurant and good service "
The ambience & guard changing ceremony,"If u wish to catch the guard changing ceremony, better come early & check the timing. Beautiful scenery & make sure to walk all around the place."
Beautiful - Long Walk - Do not Miss the Museum,"The Palace is great - the entry fee isn't expensive 3000 won - group is 2400 won for 10 people above. I think audio guide is about 1000 won. If 4 palace ticket is 10,000 won and valid for 3 months. At the entrance is the Palace museum which is free of charge and a must. You can spend almost all day here - Start off at the museum - have some lunch, and then go explore the palace. There are traditional hanbok dressing for rent around the palace. You can just take a picture outside if you do not want to walk however if you want to explore the entire place it will take 2 - 3 hours and alot of walking. There is a free palace tour every day i think about 11 and 1 pm. Check the schedule again in case it changes."
Gyeongbokgung Palace: Elegant Palace with Beautiful Pavilion on a Pond,"Gyeongbokgung Palace is an elegant palace with beautiful pavilion on a pond (Gyeonghoeru), and had been the home for many Yi Dynasty kings. Inside the palace compound is National Palace Museum of Korea with informative displays worth visiting. The admission ticket to Gyeongbokgung Palace includes visit to this museum.You can visit this palace by Metro Line 3. Get off at Gyeongbokgung stop, and follow ""Gyeongbokgung Palace"" exit sign (Exit 5) to reach the palace compound. Turn right upon getting out of the metro exit, and walk all way the across the big palace ground to the ticket office. At the ticket office, buy your admission ticket for the palace. Seniors from foreign countries are eligible for half-price admission when a proof of age such as passport or driver's license is shown to the ticket agent at the ticket window. Once you enter the palace inner court by presenting your palace admissions ticket at the entrance, you can wander around the palace ground with historical palace buildings. You can visit the palace halls, and walk to the beautiful pavilion on a pond (Gyeonghoeru). On the palace ground, you will come across many young people wearing colorful Korean costume (Hanbok) making you feel as if you have embarked on a time travel to the past. Many of these young people wearing Korean costume (Hanbok) are tourists who are wearing rented costumes, because five major palaces in Seoul waive admission fees to those wearing Korean costumes. Hanbok can be rented for a relatively low price from many shops at Eulji-ro Underground Shopping Center, located near Myeong-dong and Jongno.You can view the changing of guards ceremony on the outer compound where the ticket office is located. On the way out, you can also visit the National Palace Museum of Korea near the metro station entrance."
Great piece of history,A must visit palace to learn more about the history of Korea and their historical dispute with Japan.
Nice Palace!!,we were staying near seoul station. took a taxi and within 5-10 minutes we reached this palace on 30 June. Spent a couple of hours. saw the gaurd changing ceremony. explored every corner of the palace. lots of travellers were there who were wearing the local dresses to take a picture. We loved this place.
One word : Amazing!,"I love everything about this palace. I explored every corner of this palace and I think this palace is amazing. I went in November 2016, it was fall and quite cool. Rented Hanbok ($45 for 12 hours) and went all over places wearing it. It was my most precious experience and I will surely do it again in the future!!"
Rebuilt but beautiful piece of history,When visiting Seoul you have to visit one of the palaces. Sadly most of them didn't survive however they been beautifully rebuilt. I strongly recommend taking a guided tour otherwise the purpose of the structures and grounds is lost. Be sure to plan your visit during the changing of the guards ceremony to see the beautiful uniforms and 'parade.' 
Must see on every visit to Seoul,Beautifully restored palaces in the Center of Seoul. Defiantly worth the trip and the about 3$ of entrance fee. 
Worth the visit,"Check out the palace and grounds. Allow about 2 hours and make sure to catch the changing of the guard. Afterwards, it's an easy walk to see the traditional homes of Bukchon Hanok Village. Weave your way down the hill and grab lunch at one of the many cafes."
a must visit attraction in Seoul,The palace is one of the few historical main attractions in the city so we went. We visited in June so the weather was in the 90s F. Since the palace is an open space so I highly recommend to bring an umbrella or sunscreen to reduce exposure to the blazing sun. The main hall is grand and beautiful and you would see many tourists dressed in traditional Korean costume. Expect to do a lot of walking in this area. I didn't visit all the halls as most of them are fairly similar. Therefore i only spent less than 90 mins at the palace. There is also a children's museum on site. The palace gives you a sense of historical korean architecture as well as artistic value. Definitely a must go destination in Seoul!
Pretty palace ,This palace has a lovely moat which makes it more attractive than some of the others. It also has a traditional change of the guard ceremony that is worth timing your visit around as it is quite a spectacle. 
Magnificent!,This place is a must for all travellers. Come early before 9am for the changing of guards. When we went here there was a flea market outside the palace grounds where you can buy the traditional Hanbok at costs similar to rentals. So check first the market outside. 
"Very big place,","I enjoyed the place, including those people wearing the hanbok dresses though so many tourist can't do al with picture taking"
Beautiful!,"A must-visit for tourist visiting Seoul. South Korea's historical landmark. We were able to watch the Royal Guard Changing Ceremonies, it was awesome. The place is huge, don't forget to bring your umbrella with you during summer and rainy months."
Experience the Gyeongbokgung Palace during Summer,We took an English guided tour that they have. Tour starts in front of Gyeongbokgung Palace Information Center inside the Heungnyemun Gate. Definitely gave us a better understanding of what we are seeing. The guide speak very good English. One thing I would highly recommend is to bring an umbrella during hot sunny Summer days since it's an hour tour. There is a cafe inside as well after the tour ends as you walks towards the exit direction.
best place to experience Korea culture,"This place is good to visit when there is no sun, avoid summer and also winter. spring and autumn the best. There is a museum that you can visit and it's free on the west exit. This place is big and has a mountain background that is good to take picture with. You can rent hanbok or korean traditional clothes and visit this place to add that special feels. check out my youtube channel~ search by title:#6 TRAVEL BLOG DAY 5 SEOUL - CULTURAL DAY"
super impressive,impressive. love the guards ceremony. a must go.pity we did not wear the hanbok ..it would have been perfect if we wear the hanbok & take photos against the palace. 
nothing special,"it was big, thats it. there were no guidance. good to take photo with, but you can get bored easily. "
Stunning Historical Site,"I arrived in time for the changing of the guards. What an amazing spectacle with a parade of guards in their colourful Korean uniforms, marching in formation carryingdifferent coloured flags that fluttered in the breeze. Then the main event of horns and conchs being played as a a parade of guards filled the forecourt for the change over.Definitely a unique ceremony not to be missed. I spent a number of hours exploring the Palace which has many buildings, each different and the lovely gardens. Was a real pleasure to see many Koreans dressed in traditional Hanbok clothing that added to the ambience of the Palace. So many photo opportunities particularly of the architecture and the backdrop of the mountains behind. A highlight of my Korean visit."
Tips and Directions to Bukchon Hanok Village from Gyeongbokgung Palace,"The palace is frequently visited by tourists and locals. On any given day, you will see young people dressed up in their traditional clothing, hanbok, taking pictures at the palace. The guard change ceremony starts at 10 on the main ground but there is a pre-ceremony (about 945am) that not too many people know about that begins right outside of the palace ground along the side entrance by the ticket windows. The crowd is less and IMO provided an excellent opportunity for us to take some photos. It is about 20-25 minute walk to Bukchon Hanok Village from the palace. After the ceremony you can exit the side door next to the ticket windows, turn left, and you will pass the parking lot for buses. There is a snack bar and a restroom if you wish to use. Keep walking left passing the palace walls, there should be an Art school on the right after about 7 minutes walk. Keep walking and you will pass a museum on the left. Soon after that you will see a traffic light (it should be the third crosswalk you will see since leaving the palace). Cross the street to the right and keep walking, it should be a bit uphill but still lots of fashion shops and restaurants. In about less than five minutes, there is a tourist information center on the left. Please take advantage of it because we had a hard time finding the Bukchon village even with the help of Google map."
A One-Stop Haven for Korean Tradition,"This wonderful and large complex at the heart of Seoul is a must go for Korean drama enthusiasts, especially donning their own traditional Hanbok costumes. It is a wonderful destination to visit with all the palaces, amenities (both modern and traditional) and structures flanked in lush greens."
Impressive and a great way to understand the history of South Korea,"We were actually told by our hotel that the palace (and all the other palaces in Seoul) close on Mondays but we happened upon it on our walk around Seoul in search of the Hyundai Art Gallery. As it turned out the gallery was closed but the palace was open so we were able to walk in to the imposing forecourt and surrounds. The setting is wonderful overlooked on the one side by a towering mountain and on the other by a range of imposing city skyscrapers. The 13th century palace has been built and rebuilt and destroyed several times over the centuries, the most recent renovation only a couple of decades back. There's enough there to give a sense of days gone by and former splendour. "
Nice palace for photo opportunity,"Rent a Hanbok at any stores nearby and you will gain free admission to the palace. Although the rental is more expensive than the admission ticket (around 15,000 won for 1.5 hour rental) but it is a good experience and all your pictures will come out better in this nice palace. There is also guard changing shift ceremony at the main gate so do drop by for the show before leaving."
It was a lovely place,"We were there in winter, so it was very cold. The weather made it difficult to stay outdoor for a longer time. Otherwise, is a very nice place for pictures taking and strolling. Go in other seasons, I am sure it is more enjoyable."
A touch of old time charm ,This place is big. Be prepared to spend a few hours if you really want to explore each corner including the royal kitchen. Many tourists put in the traditional clothes n the ladies look great in the hanbok. Picturesque with lots of history. Worth the visit. 
one of my favorite place in seoul. must see!,"like the title, this is one of my favorite place in seoul. its beautiful throghout four seasons,, nice to walk around. They open at night two times a year. Spring and Fall about two weeks each. The entrance ticket sold out like in one minute for night entrance, but if u r foreigner they have extra ticket available at site. so much more possibility to enter. special lights makes the palace extraordinary . must try!"
Venture back in time.,Visited the royal palace on a Sunday. Lots of people about taking in the beautiful weather with clear blue skies. It was fantastic to see many young Koreans in traditional dress at the palace. I was by myself so took my time in looking around
Breath taking ,"This was an excellent place the visit. We saw some beautiful architecture, gardens, and sculptures. I would recommend though that you do a walking tour, which is free. We did not have time but I think we would have learnt more if we had done one. "
Very insightful historical site,"Palace site is very big, it took us about half-day to explore it. The architecture of the palace and the surrounding buildings are very interesting, the garden inside the palace itself provides some shades during hot day. The free museum visit at the entrance of this palace should definitely worth a visit."
Past glory,This takes you to the times that were...make sure you have a good tour guide. We were with a great group and got to see this as well as the change of guard
Travel through time in a modern city,"There aren't many places in Asia where a city would sacrifice so much land in the middle of the central district to history. Seoul is a city where technology is perhaps is currently at the forefront of the world and yet they respect their rich history and display this to visitors from all over the globe. Make sure you work your time table around to see the change of guard (every two hours I think). Gwanghwamun, Heungnyemun and Gyeongbokgung are all located in the same area. One ticket will allow access to both Palaces. For those keen you can also change into Hanbok to walk around the area. Recommend checking the weather before heading there lot of open areas to walk through avoid rainy days if possible. "
Nice place to visit.,"This place is a photographer's dream. Mountains in the background. Nice clean garden, beautiful green trees and lakes and historic Korean walls and buildings and huge yards. Tourists often hire Korean traditional costumes and go here to do their best pose. Come on a weekday so less tourists and have more chance to take a shot without someone accidentally photobomb you. The nearby Folk Museum is a great way to learn about Korean history and civil culture. English audio tour available."
Great Place to Visit/Great Photo Ops,We enjoyed the palace very much. It is very large and it takes a while to go through. There are many great locations to take photos. This is a must see location in Seoul!
 Beautiful palace,"I went to the palace with my brother and I was amazing .. looked similar to forbidden city in Beijing in the beginning but then it was different.. the weather was nice also mild rain on and off and not too hot. There was a part of the palace near where the king use to take a boat trip where you can't visit unless u booked a day before, unfortunately I couldn't go there. I enjoyed my time there a lot, strongly recommend it "
Beautiful Site,Gyeongbokgung Palace is a place of pride for Koreans. I've been to this historical site several times over the years. I highly recommend taking a tour through the grounds.
Wow,First make sure you get to see the Guard ceremony we got lucky and just happened to get their right when it began. Allow yourself time to explore its big and you will find a lot of locals dressed in traditional garb getting pictures. Take you time and enjoy it is very special
LOVED THIS PLACE!,It is so big! You can also see the Blue House out of one of their exits (liken it to the white house). Our children wanted to dress like Korean princess so we hired Hanboks for them. It is a must do. It makes it all a little more magical.
Afternoon stroll in the Palace,"I went here in the afternoon with my friends. Just stop at Anguk Station and check the exact exit # so that you will not get lost. Actually, if you are not k drama fanatic you will not admire the place. It will take you at least 1 hour to take pictures and go around the area, you can just walk to the other exit of the Palace going to Bukchon Village, just ask the guard for the direction."
Nice historical site,Going there around november 2014.Quite impressing when the guards changing shift. The ritual took about 15 minutes. Heritage sites thats instagramable feels like in joseon era. I heard they lend some costume for take picture but dunno not doing it..
Intriguing palace,Intriguing palace and a nice introduction to the Korean culture. Fun to walk about and explore the buildings.
Must see,"Took a tour on a hot day. It was ok.Rented a aoudio guide. It did the job. Easy to go around with. The place is beautiful , building and gardens. There sevral cultural shows during the day. "
Beautiful palace and park,"Was very impressed by this palace and the park. The president's palace is just behind the park, so it makes it even more worth the visit. "
Meh.,"I can see why people would think this place is great. Especially for history buffs, but it's just not for me. It feels similar to Beijing's Tian An Men."
Nice place for traditional Korea,"A nicely restored/preserved palace of Korea, the location is also quite convenient with easy access from Ankok Metro station. If you wear traditional Hanbok, you will be granted free access to the Palace."
Highly recommeded Free English guided tour,"They offer free guided tour 3 times a day and no reservation necessary. Tour lasts for an hour. English : 11:00, 13:30, 15:30"
Traditional Korea. Peek into the past,Must stop on your short or long stay in Korea. Beautiful grounds. Colorful palace and building. Amazing photo opportunities. Lots of folks choose to rent local traditional clothing. Dress like a king and get free entry. Makes it very attractive and lots of participants 
Free entry every last Wednesday of the month,Visited the palace and managed to get in free as it was the last Wednesday of the month. The guard changing ceremony takes place twice a day (10am and 2pm) in the courtyard. It wasn't crowded and we took a leisure walk through the palace. There's also a little tea place within the palace if you want to drink tea or taste some royal snacks. 
Free guided tour,"I joined a free guided tour which helped me to appreciate some things that I would normally have overlooked. It's a shame that so much of it was destroyed at various times in the past, but it was impressive nontheless and well worth a visit."
nice historic place,One of historic places in Seoul that must be visited...A place where you can learn about the history of South Korean kingdom in the past
Beautiful ,"I have been to this palace three times so far. Last time I wore Hanbok. (by the way if you wear Hanbok, you can enter the palace for free) It is a beautiful place with a lake and sometimes you can see traditional ceremonies. "
Palace is good,Honestly it looks a lot like Chinese palace with lesser stuffs It's big enough and a must see but then it was an ok place for meIn front of the palace are expensive food and nothing special about it Just a must see then but not a must stay in the area 
June 2017,"Went here on a hot day in June. It was pretty cool to see. I'm by no means a history buff or even that into cultural things, but I can appreciate the history of this palace. I think its a must-see if you're in Seoul!"
Love it ,I love it.. If you love Historic places you will love this place many good place to see and to learn about Korean culture and history.. The the emperor and royal family .. Also there are a museum.. Good place to take your child with you to see and to learn from.. And infant can also enjoy as there are a special area for children and mother to rest and to enjoy the time with educational playground and game 
Incredibl historical complex,"One of the main attraction and iconic site of the city, a very big complex with many historical palace, residences, pavilions and halls. There's free guided English tours at specific times and also don't miss the changing guard ceremony, a must see "
Very nice place,A must try when in korea. A lot of people wearing hanbok and taking pictures. For peopleqho wants to take beautiful picture its a nice place to visit
Really Interesting ,The changing of the guard ceremony is really good and costumes are so colorful. The precision of the performance is just perfect. The palace is amazing and buildings are intricate in design. Such a pleasant walk amongst real history.
Great Location full of interesting history,We had a great time going through the Gyeongbokgung Palace. The history was quite interesting. We thoroughly enjoyed the museum. 
"Good, but could be so much better","A smaller version of Beijing's forbidden city. Not so old in reality given it seems to have been ravaged by Japanese occupation at least twice but the city is trying to restore to its former glory. So much history there but not much by way of signage to indicate the role and purpose of many of the buildings, how life was lived in the palaces and grounds. Very few photos of what it looked in its heyday before the modern city of Seoul swamped its grandure. "
Beautiful Palace,I visited this palace in May.. Its beautiful and very well preserved. You need plenty of time to walk around the palace and enjoy the beauty. 
Beautiful,"We rented the hanbok (the traditional outfit) and walked around the palace. It felt like you were part of a Korean drama. It was fun and the place is surprisingly huge, so were your comfortable shoes. "
Nice and well preserve historical site,A well known historical site for tourists to see in Seoul.The palace located in the center of the city. Easy to find by car bus or subway
Huge place that look the same inside,"It nice for sure. But when you walk into it for a few hours, you realised many buildings are the same and start to get bored"
Pleasant stroll ,"Lovely stroll in the afternoon, beautiful greenery, not crowded at all.. definitely worth the visit! "
If you have plenty of time,"We visited the palace today. Arrived about 1030 and paid our $14,000 won. We were able to easily walk around the site and whilst there was some fascinating features in the roof of the buildings and beautiful parkland surrounds the feature were the mountains in the background.We were then lucky enough to see the changing of the guard ceremony as we were leaving.The visit was an ok experience but would have survived without it.A 6/10 experience."
Historic landmark,"This palace is the first one in the list of must-see destinations in Seoul. If you want to get a full immersion into the Korean culture I strongly advise to rent a Hanbok (traditional Korean dress) and walk around the palace in it. Btw, the entrance to the palace is free if you're wearing Hanbok, and it is relatively cheap to rent one- around W20,000 for 2 hours."
Historically significant !,The Korean palaces are excellent stops when touring Seoul. Great stories of kings and history in Korea. Architecture is fascinating and worth taking time to enjoy. Amazing how the palaces are positioned inside a modern city and how they have been preserved for visitors. 
Good,Gyeongbokgung palace so beautiful. The place so clean and well groomed. It's best place for take a photo. You must visit here if you go to Seoul
lovely,"Beautiful and very pleasant and interesting, easily accessible and very well maintained. Strongly recommended!"
"Beautiful, grand, tranquil Gyeongbokgung","Highly recommend a visit to this grand and beautiful palace. Many young (and old) ladies were wearing hanboks and taking photos around the palace grounds (you can rent a hanbok inside the palace grounds, or you can rent one from one of the stores just west of the palace entrance). We didn't catch the changing of the guards, but we still enjoyed taking photos around the palace. We stayed at the Four Seasons hotel, and it was a nice 10-minute stroll from the hotel. Even the kids enjoyed the vast open space. We stayed at Gyeongbokgung for less than an hour as we had a dinner to catch, but you can easily spend more time here."
Looks more like a newly built studio set than a historical site,"The place is vast but nothing impressive/memorable. The palace looks newly built rather than a historical site.Lots of vast , sandy open areas. The gardens are very boring and ameteurish. Didn't find it interesting or memorable. Seen much more impressive historical sites in Asia than this. Japan has much better and more impressive historical site. If you don't have much time in Seoul, can skip this. "
A place to visit once. ,"Not for everyone. If you get tired of seeing the same structures repeatedly, visiting just this palace would do. You can skip the other palaces and go straight to shopping or other activities. "
Can't miss when in South Korea,"From the National Folk museum, you can walk through the vast land area full of architectural buildings in an old Joseon era set up. One can guess that this is where historical Korean dramas are shot. Free guided tours are available in English. The place is good for photo op's & during our stay, most locals came with their traditional hanbok costume. "
Look at the past,A wonderful look at the lifestyle several 100 years ago. It is amazing to watch the changing of the guard ceremony.
Time travel back to the Joseon Dynasty,"No visit to Seoul is complete without a visit to the iconic Gyeongbokgung Palace. This is the main royal palace of the 500 years old Joseon Dynasty. With a name (Gyeong-Bok) that literally means brilliance and fortune, this palace does not flatter to deceive. With an internal compound that is as grand as the Forbidden Palace in Beijing, it would take you a good 2 hours to cover all grounds within the palace. The many tourists walking the grounds dressed in traditional Korean costume (hanbok) which are rented from the nearby shops, helps create an atmosphere from the bygone Joseon Dynasty days. I only wish more of the interior rooms could be opened up to give visitors a glimpse into how the King and his royal escorts live their lives back then. Finally, don't forget to visit the 2 adjacent free museums - National Folk Museum and National Palace Museum - to complete your time travel back to the Joseon Dynasty."
Intense Culture of Korea,"A place where I felt the history and culture of Korea. From the Royal Guard ceremony at the entrance gate to the pavilions and gazebos inside the palace, it left me breathless, speechless and amazed. My favorite place so far in Seoul."
Nice place -- well commented and distributed,It was great to go through the various palace areas which were well described and the maps did a great job of explaining the various structures ---Liked the place
A Glimpse Into Korean History,"We visited as part of a tour on a very hot day… so I was somewhat anxious to do a quick visit then leave. If you are into history and seeing temples and palaces, this will probably be worthwhile. Personally, I found it somewhat boring."
Must go,"This is a historical monument which is conserved well. If you want to take a photo with the traditional costume - Hanbok in the Palace, you can rent at many shops outside, around the Palace ( you must ask for the price before renting). And, if you wear the Hanbok, you haven't to pay for the ticket. The Palace is large with the traditional, feature architecture and landscape design. Hope you will enjoy this place! "
Great experience,"I never went to palace before.This is my first experience and we loved it even we didn't explore palace further more because we did bring two strollers but this place definitely most go when we visit Seoul.We are in seoul right now.Summer but wind was chilling so we didnt even feel like we are in summer season.Gyeongbokgung palace also very accessible using subway ""Gyeongbokgung""."
Fantastic must see (guide and a night visit recommended),"Steeped in history and beauty, this massive historical complex is being tastefully restored. The free guided tours will bring this place to life as they steer you through the characters and events which makes this a first class experience. English 1030 and 1530 lasts about 70 minutes and well worth it.Beautifully illuminated at night and worth the return visit.Thanks for the vote if you found this review helpful."
Beautiful palace,Free if you wear a hanbok to the palace. Do check out this place.. big place with peaceful environment.
Historical place in Seoul,"If you are in Seoul, it is one of the places you have to drop by. Historical palace and you can see many people with korean traditional custom."
Beautiful palace!,"This a beautiful palace with buildings set among picturesque gardens and lily ponds, well worth the price of admission. Also, don't miss the Folk Art museum (included in the ticket price). There were some very interesting exhibits covering many different aspects of Korean culture, traditional craftsmanship and history."
Nice palace,"We spent a total of about 2 hrs walking around here. The taxi driver dropped us off at the side entrance by the culture museum so that's where we started. The whole palace here is not very big, so doesn't take very long to walk through. Since we came through the side, we weren't able to join a free tour either. So unfortunately there was not much explanation minus what was mentioned briefly on the map. I do wish they had signs or something up in each area so you're not just staring and walking blindly.There is a lot of construction going on right now so you'll see a lot of white fences up, which unfortunately blocked visiting any of the over water structures. That was a bit disappointing but understandable.If the timing works, I do recommend catching the catching of the guards performance. They don't need real guard any more these days so it's more of a show than the real stuff like at Buckingham, but was still fun to watch for 15 min. Then you can go take pictures with them.Given a lot of similar structures and building styles, I can't stop comparing this to the Forbidden City. Gyeongbokgung is just not as large or grand and therefore did not seem as impressive to me. But still worthy of a visit."
A great palace worth visiting ,So many palaces in Seoul and decided to visit this one. Really made the right choice as amazed by the beautiful sceneries. Entry fee is 3000 won for adult.
Interesting Palace,"One of the places we visited to learn more about the history of Seoul, You can also visit the museum next door. "
Largest of the palaces,"Gyeongbukgong is the largest palace in Seoul and is a must visit attraction. And most popular which means lots of tourist. You must get there before 10 am so as to watch the changing of the guards. Great for taking pictures. But if want to see history, you must not miss this palace and all the grounds."
Trip,Perfect for cultural exposure. Big field with old historical monuments and small waterstreams between houses. Good for any tourist who looks for understanding into korean tradition and history
one of the palace to visit in Seoul,"To learn the history (even it is related to recent 600 years only)and King's life, it is highly recommended to visit this palace."
Spectacular,"Awesome architecture, wonderful performance. The place is huge, lots of tourist. Near to Bukchon Hanok Village, walking distance. "
So grand!,It's grand and really huge. So happy to finally see it coz we've been seeing it only in Kdramas. It's huge so I suggest to wear comfy shoes. There's a lot of hanbok rentals nearby to complete the experience. Plus you can enter the palaces for free if you're wearing a hanbok. 
Visit to Gyeongbokgung Palace,"Get off from Gyeongbokgung Station exit 5 you walk directly to the park of Gyeongbokgung palace.very huge place.free entry if you wear Hanbok,korean traditional outfit.you can rent 15,000₩/person for 4 hours at the shop near the Palace.You can take some picts in the palace area..but you cant enter the palace..in the outside of palace we will meet the guard.the changing guard will be taken at 11am.You can cross the street and walk to Gwanghwamun Area.There's a park and museum of King Jeoson who discover Hangeul.Interesting museum..you must go there...free entry."
Unique,This was one of my favorite historic sites to see in Seoul. I would recommend seeing this for yourself. Some of the women dress up in Hanbok to take photos inside. Near local subways stations or you can catch a cab.
Amazing Palace,"I don’t want to miss Gyeongbokgung Palace because it is the oldest and largest Seoul’s palace. The entrance fee is only 3,000 won but if you want to experience wearing Hanbok or Traditional dress you can rent for 30,000won + you can get a free entry discount. One more thing, don’t miss to watch the Royal Guard Changing Ceremonies. It is a great opportunity to experience a rare traditional scene in Korea."
Most popular Palace attraction,"There are several palaces in Seoul opened to the public. Gyeongbokgung is perhaps one of the more popular. Comparatively it does have more interesting structure. Of all the palaces I visit, Gyeongbokgung has activities that bring Korean culture closer to the visitors. Overall definitely one of the palace you should visit if palaces is on your agenda. "
Grand,"This is a huge palace that has been restored by a fire in the past. If you exit from the train station Gwanghwamun, you will be awed by a huge golden statue of King Sejong placed in the square outside the palace gate. Turn around and you will see the statue of a soldier guarding the whole place.The admission cost KRW3000. You could get to witness the Change of Guards ceremony at a certain time.Take your time to explore the splendour and architecture."
Join the on-site free tour!,Rented a hanbok and was able to enter the palace for free. Joined the on-site tour in English and it was good :) Enjoyed the guard-changing ceremony too!
Beautiful palace ,I was there with friend after our work it's amazing and beautiful.we very much enjoy wearing costumes hanbox a traditional Korea Stye where u can find rent from outside palace cost approx 15000-20000 won its so nice to get this experience and you don't have to pay for entrance fee if you are in the costume. There is parade for guards exchanges which is very interesting too. We spend almost half day there it really a wonderful time☺️
Nice to visit and walk around - more like a park rather than a historical place,"It's a nice palace, but there is nothing that describes the buildings or the history of it.I was hoping that it would provide some detailed history of the buildings and not just where people take pictures ONLY."
Fascinating Sunday,"I decided to immerse myself in at least one major attraction (ended up with three), and this was the crown jewel. Not only were the buildings beautiful and fascinating, but on the day I visited, there were parades and demonstrations by costumed employees. It is hard to fathom the life the Koreans have been under, given near-continuous wars and occupations, but this palace does give the visitor a feeling of the grandeur of the country at peace. I would recommend this, as well as the neighboring museums, for a deep appreciation of the people, their politeness and hospitality, despite many years of turmoil."
Beautiful palace,"We took the English tour. Included in the admission. The tour was well done explaining the history and pointing out many items you wouldn't notice on your own. Mostly outside, so it is best to go on a nice day."
Changing of guards ,We took the metro to Gyeongbokgung station and exited at exit 5. This will bring you to the left side entrance of the palace. The palace is huge so put on some good walking shoes to fully explore the entire compound. We arrived just in time for the changing of guards ceremony at 1100hrs which is a real highlight of our visit as we got to see the colorful and meaningful ceremony (commentary in English and mandarin is played on the PA System) explaining the ongoings. We then took some time to pose with the guards (warning no touching of their clothes or bodies when posing with them.) You will then need to buy tickets to access the inner section of the palace and pls note that washrooms are after the ticket booth somewhere in the middle section of the palace compound. We had to do a long detour back after we exited the compound. There are lot of locals and tourists in traditional hanbok dress who have purposely dressed up or rented outfits somewhere outside posing for photos throughout the palace. So incase you want to catch photos of someone in traditional dress. Also there is a hanbok dress up rental within the palace incase you want to join them. A must visit for a chance to see old Korean historical building and ceremonies.
Wonderful place to visit,Caught the changing of guards. It was very well executed. Fun taking photos with the 'guards'. The palace is big and impressive. There is also a folk museum. It is of high quality. The children folk museum is also fun. The exhibits are interactive and well designed. Really surprised that for such a nice place it is free to visit for all.
The Palace,"The Palace ground is big, There are Korean's who dress in their national costumes who look so beautiful. At the ticket area, you will find some people who want to be a free guide to you to speak english. They will explain to you the history of the Palace. Inside there is also a National Palace Musem of Korea. Take note that the guard changing ceremony is at 10.00 am & 14.00pm. The guard duty performance is @ 11.00 & 13.00pm . "
Cultural bliss,"Reconstructed palace of history. What a peaceful spot in the middle of a large and vibrant city. Kit yourself out in Hanbok costume for free entry or just pay and enjoy the delightful show. Koreans love this place. The costumes enliven and lighten the wide open spaces. The further you enter into the site, the nearer you get to the mountains. Delightful and a must see."
Huge palace,"The palace grounds is very huge, and it is a great place for photo taking. Many tourists and locals, as well as students, visit the palace daily. The palace guards changing ceremony was interesting. It took place at around noon time. A small entrance fee is required to visit the palace."
K Drama,Nice place to visit. Reminiscing the Korean dramas....Make sure to bring gadgets for picture takings. So many nice spots.
Go well prepared during hot days,"Suggest to go visit during the morning or later in the afternoon. We went just after lunch and it was a really hot day at 30 degree Celsius. We were so tired and thirsty and have to rest every now and then after 30mins walking or so. Bring a cap/hat, sunglasses and water if you do go during summer or hot day! Palace is huge and will be even more pretty I believe during the Autumn period. One can spend at least 3 hours covering the whole palace so it will be good to go during a cooler day. We did not wait for the guided tour as we did expect to spend more than 2 hours in the palace which in the end we did due to much walking and resting!"
Deserving of all the hype. The best single site attraction in Seoul,"This is a large complex of restored palace buildings that also includes two stand-alone museums, each of which would be a worthwhile attraction in their own right. The combination could easily occupy half a day or more and provides a great combination of history, art, and architecture. The one sight to see even with only a short time in Seoul. Be aware that there are restoration works going on regularly, so there will be some construction fencing and inaccessible areas.The changing of the guard ""show"" takes place in the main courtyard and so does not require admission--handy if you ""miss"" it due to schedule or weather and want to do it separately.It is possible to combine it with the two ""C"" palaces in the area, but that would be a lot of walking and maybe an overload on ""restored palace"" experience. "
"Great palace, need a tour guide","This palace is impressive and has been restored well. It is one of the busiest palaces so we went in the morning to avoid crowds. The buildings are beautiful but there is barely any information. I highly suggest either reading up about the structures online or hiring a guide to take you around the site. Without either of these things we were left stuck looking at buildings and wondering their purposes. Additionally, spend the small extra for a multi ticket as you can see other nearby palaces with it."
Korea history ,"It's a smaller scale palace compared to other countries. But it's a good place to learn Korea history. Free guided tour offered in English inside the palace, check the official website for the schedules. The free tour's duration is about an hour."
Must see in Seoul,"The attraction is very well maintained. There are many tourists going around here. You will see many people wearing hanbok. This is quite interesting, and do not forget to watch the ceremony on the changing of the guards."
History of Korea ,"This is one of several places you need to visit, learn about the different kingdoms, and how one king united the country preWWI, see the changing of the guards, and enjoy the beautiful view of the palace offers "
"Impressive reconstruction, but do not go without a guide","Sprawling Palace complex reconstructed based ancient documents, it is very interesting to see, but we would not have known what we were looking at, or the lifestyle and other interesting aspects of it if not for the guide we had. A good look at their ancient past."
Huge palace ,"If you only plan to see 1 Palace, this should be it because it is like the other main palaces, except huge, it takes a few hours to fully appreciate everything. Be sure to see an event with the guards, it's very interesting. Additionally you will see a lot of people wearing the traditional hanbok. "
Change of guards,The palace is worth the visit for its unique oriental buildings and its change of guards which matches that at the Buckingham palace. The rooms are empty so don't expect to see fine interiors. 
Seoul sisters ,Came to see the Palace with my sister. Soooooo pretty and the weather was perfect. We loved it. There's a museum as well as a lot of people doing reenactments. It is a fair amount of walking and some stairs. 
Nice place for a sunny day,Expect a lot of outdoor walking as this palace consist of many separate buildings. So go on a sunny day if you want great photos or a cloudy day if you don't like constant exposure in the sun. You can watch the changing of the guards just outside of the palace as well but personally I didn't think it was that spectacular. There are several free guided tours in various languages each day which I highly recommend as it gives you a little bit of background of the palace including some interesting facts. It lasts for an hour or so and afterwards you will still get plenty of time to explore the place yourself. There are plenty of nice photo spots especially if you're in Hanbok (the traditional Korean clothing). Btw if you're dressed in Hanbok you get into the palace for free. Including the guided tour we spent around 2.5 hours there. 
The most famous royal palace of Seoul,"In the morning you can view the changing of the guards, then you can walk around the site and imagine yourself back then."
"Heart of the city, spirit of nation","This palace is one of many, but only one must to see. Plan to use half of day to move around and get inspired by great culture. Best time to visit is outside summer months since it's quite hot and crowded this period. Easy to get there by subway since it's located just downtown if city. After that can connect with leisure walking around the city."
MUST-VISIT PALACE OF KOREA,"If you must visit a pavilion or palace, consider making the trip to Gyeongbokgung. Even when we visited on a rainy day, it was still worth it. The palace is humongous in proportion, and is right in front of the National Museum of Korea. I was aware that parts of Gyeongbokgung are already reconstructions from the original, but the scale is still astounding. You'll be swept away with the sights and ambiance of Korea's past dynasties. There are so many photo taking opportunities too, especially if you look around the nearby city for Hanbok rentals. If you're more into the history of the palace, there are English audio guide rentals for solo travelers and walking tours in Chinese and English. I absolutely adore this landmark and I feel like I haven't seen enough of it to truly understand its complexity. This is a must-visit! "
Interesting,The grounds are mostly outdoors and the palace/throne rooms are even more open air. It takes a while to cover the area and I wish there was more educational value to the location. The changing of the guard ceremony was neat.
An attraction with both ancient and modern history,Not far from the National Museum this Palace is set in very attractive gardens where the atmosphere is both clam and peaceful. Dating back over 600years it is still used today and we were told that it was the venue of a high level meeting involving major international dignitaries not too long ago. The pagoda style is typically Korean and although the building itself may only be of interest for a short period of time the grounds are well worth a visit.
Don't wait until the afternoon,"We only got their around 3pm, and felt as though as we had to rush to see everything (and not get lost in the process!). Tea rooms were closing. There are walls within walls. We were heading to find the water feature, only to eventually find we'd been circumnavigating it: it was behind temporary walls for renovation!"
Must do when in Seoul,"Must see place to visit allow a couple of hours here to take in the culture, history and wander around exploring. The guards at the front seem to be more a tourist attraction with their stick on beards and more a part time job than others I have seen in London etc. Don't let this put you off thou as once inside you get to see and learn about the history of Gyeongbokgung Palace. Do make sure you take the free tour lasting just over an hour will give you a good insight into its history and best of all it is free, if you dress traditionally thou it is free entry, great to see so many doing it certainly adds to the atmosphere. Like most places in Seoul it was cheap admission and certainly worth the cost."
A Must Visit! ,It's worth to get up early to watch the live Royal Guard changing ceremony and the free guided tours. The Korean female guides are very professional and patient in their sharing. Worth visiting! 
Beautiful and Memorable,We went here in traditional Hanbok (so you get in for free!). We brought ours but you can hire them in stores near to the Palace. Its a fun experience to walk round in Hanbok as you can imagine days past where the royalty would be walking round in those types of clothes. The museum areas are really informative and the palace is just beautiful. I would definitely recommend going if you are in Seoul.
Nice culture ,"This place is really busy at times, that busy that it is hard to get a good photo, it is pretty big to so make sure you have good walking shoes on and take water, you can not miss the changing of the guards at 11am 1pm and 3pm it good to watch.  "
Large Palace,A giant palace which many get lost easily if you don't have a guide or a map. Buildings are similar across the whole palace with minor differences. It would be great if you have a guide with you as many things they mentioned was not easily discovered by tourists.
Breathtaking palace,I went with my sister when she came to visit me in Korea. I have been there many times before but it was the first time I attended the tour. This place is absolutely beautiful and the tour was very informative. Also went to the tea restaurant and had tea inside the palace which was an amazing experience. I felt very traditional! 
great photo ops,Went 2 hours before closing and had more than enough time to see everything we wanted to. If you want a guided tour go early but a I don't think it is needed
Must see,"Even if you have only very limited time, this is a must see. Very impressive and built to last. Takes 1-2 hours."
Nice place,It's nice to visit here! you can try Korean traditional clothing nearby that you can get in the palace without admission fee. The palace is so big that you might need to spend whole morning here. Seeing their traditional building and have some pictures here are truly fun! 
Excellent palace visit,"The palace was great place to go. It is quite extensive and we took one of the free tours in English, which was offered at the museum, and was very informative. Our tour guide was Korean but spoke e cel lent English. We visited on ""Culture Day"", which is the last Wednesday of every month when admission to museums are free so that was great. Highly recommend to visit if in Seoul!"
Excellent palace,I visited Changdeokgung palace and this one and I definitely recommend this one if you only have time for one. We enjoyed watching the changing of guards and it had more structures to see.
Very nice palace,First time coming to Korea with my husband. Always wish to try the Hanbok and finally i wore one. We were accompanied by our friend that stay in seoul. We went there by public bus and walk to the shop area to rent the hanbok with price KRW10.000 for 2 hours. If we wear hanbok then the entrance fee is free. We strolling around the palace and there were some music performance from the youngster which was really nice but we missed the changing guard ceremony as we arrived there at 15:00.
Changing of the Guard.,"When visiting Seoul, it is necessary to tour palaces. I toured all of the palaces in Seoul. My conclusion, if you see one of the palaces, you have seen them all. That said, I still believe it is necessary to visit all the palaces as it is a one time experience. Gyeongbokgung's changing of the guard isn't too exciting, but still interesting. "
Not just another palace,"The Gyeongbokgung Palace is much more like a series of palaces within a palace. The majesty you feel when you walk in builds as you walk through its various inner palaces - as does the sense of wonder of how yet another suite of royal accommodations could be so impressively sited seemingly in total privacy despite being in a huge complex. And if you walk around the outer wall before entering you'll come across first a series of Mom&Pop hawker joints to eat in (recommended, they are full of personality and very honest, local food) and then some trendier renovated lanes full of boutiques and the like. Do make the effort to fully explore not just the palace, but everything there is around it."
So unique.,"If you go there in the morning,(around 10) you can see the changing of the guard. Then you can walk around until 11, and at 11 an english 1 hour tour starts and they can tell you all the history and stuff."
Very cool,"If you are a history buff, I recommend doing a guided tour. There is plenty of history to be explored. I recommend watching the change of guard. "
"Huge palace, Korean history",A glance into Korean history. Super huge and pretty palace. It was once damaged during japanese invasion period but it was rebuilt.. 
Good for walking and experiencing Korea,"Enjoyed walking and enjoying the sights and architecture, especially with visitors in Hanbok around. After awhile the buildings all sort of look the same. Appreciated those temporary exhibitions within the grounds. "
Beautiful!,"Go there in the morning and catch the ""Changing of the Royal Guards"" which starts at 10 a.m. before exploring the large palace buildings. They are no less than stunning."
Forbidden city of Korea but less crowded,This place is much better to walk around coz its way less crowded. its a big facility as well so be prepared for lots of walking. Take photos with the soldier in ancient uniform at the front gate and also a demonstration from the soldiers as well
Very interesting,Definitely worth a visit when in Seoul. Very interesting and very well preserved for a small entrance fee. Try to see the changing of the guard ceremony - excellent to watch!
Historical place with nice views ,It is one of main palaces located in heart of Seoul city. Connected well by Seoul metro. Has a museum attached to it. Behind the palace you can visit folk museum where traditional Korean folk dance are exhibited
huge palace,"one of the top-things-to-do in seoul on websites and travel guidebooks.it's good and fun.a lot of locals and tourist wearing hanbok,huge complex so it'll take some time.there's also a guard-changing ceremony that you can watch. and its cool.."
Palace,It's a awesome and magistic place. You can walk around and explore this gigantic place by your self. Guide's are also good but according to me no need for that. Many things are in English and you don't need to know much if you only want to see the palace....how the kings and queens lived. It's a big place....i listened to music and walked around!. After I visited the palace museum that is free and nice to see. I also visited the teahouse inside the palace and drank one of the kings favourite tea against illness it was a nice experience! If you like culture....then you must visit this place...u won't regret it! 
Fabulous historical place to visit,You just can't go to Seoul and not visit this place. Such a beautiful palace and entry is not expensive. Very big place so reserve at less half a day here.
Fun,I enjoyed it. I went on a Sunday and many families and couples were there dressed in their traditional garments. It was fun! 
Back in time!,"Made me feel transported back to the time of the old Korean dynasty with a view of the palace, surroundings, the royal guards, and the heat! Nostalgic moment."
Wonderful Visit,We enjoyed the history of this Palace. The changing of guards is fun to watch. The people coming to visit have an opportunity to dress in costume dresses to visit the Palace. Completely awesome!!!!
Very cool palace,"We came here as part of a shore excursion on a cruise. The buildings and grounds are very interesting. I don't remember if there was much signage so you may need a guide to interpret what you are seeing. There were many young people roaming the grounds in traditional Korean dress and you can pose for pictures with them. I found that very cool and I enjoyed my time here. There were not a lot of inside things to see, just peering through a door."
Heritage palace,"Downtown. It's seem have to visit this place before you visiting another place tourism. No wifi, Clean, clear signage, family. "
Must-see tourist spot,Rent a hanbok from any of the hanbok stores nearby and get a ticket for free at the booth from the side. Otherwise you would have to pay a fee. Take pretty pictures with the hanbok though it might be hot wearing it.
Dont bother too long if you are not interested in History,"It is a must see attraction in Seoul that every visitors should pay a visit here. However if you are not immensly interested in history, peeping in through the front door is fine since every palace look exactly the same."
A beautiful inspiration heritage palace ,Huge open and garden area to walk and must love the architectural work to be indpired. You can have pictures takenwith the guards at entrance. Beautiful area to wonder and see the museum and new President building but don't lose your entrance ticket to re-enter the palace ground. Also the temple building just above the museum. Worth the visit and canter around the palace ground plus the emper throne. Enjoy the magnificent architecture.
Very cool palace,Outstanding museum attached to the palace. The grounds and palace were very interesting. Took lots of photos.
Good for first timers in Korea,"As Korea and Chinese has similar cultures, if you had been to Forbidden City in Beijing,then this is a dwarf version. However, if this is your first time in Korea, it would be recommended. One can tell that they put in a lot of effort to make the place interesting by adding a lot of cultural experience for tourist. Overall it's fun and entertaining and worth the visit!"
Gyeongbokgung palace,It was great place to see the history of Korea- Josun Dynasty including good time and sad time. (the last King of Josen Dynasty)
"Main palace among ""Five Grand Palaces"". UNESCO believes otherwise.","Gyeongbokgung is the main among ""Five Grand Palaces"" in Seoul – Changdeokgung, Changgyeonggung, Deoksugung and Gyeonghuigung. But! Its rival -Changdeokgung became UNESCO World Heritage from 1997. Why didn`t Gyeongbokgung become despite its historical meaning? Thanks to its history! It was twice destroyed by the Japanese during the invasion and occupation. Last time Japanese destroyed it as the symbol of national independence and sovereign power. That`s why most buildings inside are rather new. Not restored but built again. Palace is closed eaurly at 5.00. p.m. That`s why I could visit it just with 3rd attemt. We`ve lost 1-st day in Seoul due to Jetlag, 2-nd and 3rg days I arrived from Namhanseong and Suwon just at closure. I arrived just in time for the closing. And only in the morning before leaving for Busan, I was able to come almost to the opening. It was a weekend and the Babylonian pandemonium was in the Palace. But mostly Koreans participated in Babylonian pandemonium. According to the traditional attitudes of the tourist to look at the Palace of nothing. No furniture. Sculptures no. Paintings either. In short, not Versailles, and not the Hermitage. If this is your first Palace, a slight disappointment or confusion can not be. I already had one Palace of the big five and 2 UNESCO world heritage in Suwon and Namhansanseong, so I was not surprised. Once ambivalent sense it is necessary to visit: Gangnyeongjeon (King's Quarters), Geunjeongjeon (Throne Hall), Gyeonghoeru (Royal Banquet Hall), Gyotaejeon (Queen's Quarters). They are almost the same. But next place will be romantic - Hyangwonjeong Pavilion near small lake. After that I would recommend to turn to right (East) and visit Korean folk museum. You`ll able to understand that the technological victories of Samsung, LG and Hundai on the world markets are not random, but prepared by the whole history of Korea. Entrance ticket is the same as in Gyeongbokgung."
historical grand palace,"a must visit when travelling to Seoul. As Joseon dynasty's main palace, it is one of the most preserved palace, beside Changdeokgung. It is always packed with tourist. you can visit the palace for free if you wear hanbok. To learn more about its history, you are suggested to join the palace guided tour."
Stunning night view,This was the second time I was here because of night entry. From 19:00 - 21:30 you could wander around the palace for night scenes. There were not a lot to see but the most important thing was to see the building above the lake. The mot stunning view I saw in Seoul. Definitely can't miss the chance for night entry!
Lovely view,Very scenic view for couples to stroll around. The spring Breeze and setting sun makes it so relaxing to walk! Should drop by the national folk museum of Korea as well since it just beside. 
An excellent glimpse of traditional Korean architecture and royal life in the heart of Seoul,"This palace is highly accessible to those who visit Seoul. The palace has many features that both shared with other traditional Asian architecture, and also unique for Korea. Like many other grand structures built by hand in other parts of the world, this palace made me feel in awe over the engineering and human effort required to erect such a building. Worth a relatively quick 1 to 2-hour visit for first-timers to Korea."
A must see,"Historic Palace in central Seoul on all the standard tours so you won't miss out seeing it, very enjoyable"
The cultural experience is still the best in Seoul,One of the things that I look forward to when I visit the country is the overall cultural experience. A lot of countries today are so westernized and modernized that they lose the culture and what is their country is known for.But for Seoul it is intact. The palaces and its history are preserved. Must see when in South Korea!
nice place to learn about culture and instagram photos,"It is a beautiful place and good to learn about their cultures. You will be in best experience if you rent a hanbok from nearby store and visit around the palace, I felt like I was in Korean drama, had a lot of Instagram shots ;)"
Beautiful! No filters needed!,A must if you visit Seoul! The views and the palace is heavenly. Try to go on weekday as so many people are there on weekend and hard to see the performances! 
Awesome! ,We visited the Palace in the morning where there were no crowds yet. There were several buildings to walk by. We were awed by the guards ceremony. Amazing! So surreal!
