"Nice big complex, with múltiple buildings, historical place , i take with tour compañía, But cheaper by subway, a must if you go to seoul","October 5, 2019"
"Everything about this Palace resonates history and the rich culture of the Koreans. Entry is free for vistors in the traditional outfit (Hanbok) and at a low cost for visitors without the outfit. There are several shops near the near Palace where you can rent a Hanbok for 1 to 2hours. The cost of renting my outfit was ₩10,000 for 2hours. The palace also has a park where you can have lunch after some sightseeing. This is worth your last penny. Enjoy","October 4, 2019"
"I visited Gyeongbokgung Palace on March 10th 2019, for me was a cold day since I live in the carribean, and thought I'd love to wear a hanbok, i could bear to be in thos very thin fabric dresses, so I skip that and pay the fee to access the palace. The place is HUGE I walked and walked and walked is seem endless. I visited the museum of South Korean history,was very interesting and very big too.The building I love to watch the most was the main building where the throne of the King was, and to watch the show of the change of guard at the main entrance of the palace. Was a great experience and I highly recommend it. Z","October 4, 2019"
"Unforgettable visit, will definitely return for another visit next time in Seoul! Very traditional architecture!","October 4, 2019"
"A visit to Gyeongbokgung should be on everyone’s list when visiting Seoul. It was the main palace for the Joseon Dynasty, the last dynasty before the Japanese colonization in 1910. It is significant historically, but also worth visiting because of its beauty. Be sure to rent some traditional clothing before going in to get some unique pictures that will be truly memorable!","October 3, 2019"
"We had the fortunate timing of watching the palace guard change ceremony, and it was an event to watch. For those who are multi-lingual, the broadcast is in 4 languages: Korean, Japanese, Chinese, and English. The palace itself is grand, even though it's not the same scale as the Forbidden City in Beijing. Still, it is worthy of a visit.","October 3, 2019"
We really enjoyed walking about the palace and learning some of the history. The dynasty and royalty is fascinating and the structures are beautiful.,"October 3, 2019"
"If you ignore the whole place was rebuilt not long ago and hence isn't particularly original (although, of course, rebuilt in its impressive, historical, form) it is definitely worth seeing. Sprawling, busy and imposing it is a must when visiting Seoul.","October 3, 2019"
"Very nice place to visit while in Seoul. Historical site, not to crowded. Spend nice time there. Recomend it for everyone visiting even if they have little time. However is not worth to wait for the change of guards. ","October 2, 2019"
Tried on a hanbok and had fun being silly photo taking and walking around the palace. Saw a cordoned off throne seating area. Walked the grounds in the summer heat but still enjoyed myself.,"October 2, 2019"

"This palace (mostly restored) is the oldest of the Joseon dynasty. Free for those over 65 and note that 64 in US counts as 65 in Korea (bring your passport for proof of age). Otherwise, just 3,000 won.Very large and many photo ops. Be sure to spend time in the free Palace Museum just outside the paying area.","September 30, 2019"
"Take metroline 3 (orange) and get out at Gyeongbokgung station. This is a must see/do when in Seoul. It´s one of the most well maintained historical sites I have ever visited. Like many ´main tourist attractions´ it´s full of tourists, but because many locals like to rent traditional clothing and walk around all dressed up it gives you a very authentic feeling (until you all see people taking selfies and you are reminded they are from 2019 and not from the past). For me it was a great way to get to know Seoul/ South Korea on my first day. I went on my own for a quick visit, but if you have a chance to do a guided tour and learn about it´s history I think that would be very interesting. The place itself is huge and you can easily hang around for two hours. Later I found out there was a huge chunk of the park I missed (the water part) because I crossed over to the National folk museum, which is also well worth a visit by the way. If you have more time and feel like walking a bit more, you can also visit the Bukchon Hanok village at about 500 meters distance.","September 30, 2019"
"Nice enough, but big open space and after you’ve stared at it for 5-10 mins...wondering what to do with one’s self. ","September 30, 2019"
"On the dates posted on their official website (in Korean; not in English), foreigners can purchase up to 4 tickets at the ticket booth with a valid ID/passport. When I visited in September 2019, nighttime ticket sales started at 6:30 pm. Visitors were able to enter the palace at 6:40 pm, and were guided to go out at 9:00 pm. Hanboks (Korean traditional dresses) look gorgeous with the palace's night view!","September 29, 2019"
"The buildings, the grounds and the history are incredible. Everything you see is historic.To start, we took the #3 train and got off at the Jongno station, exit 1 takes you straight to the palace and museum. We got there right when the changing of the guards had finished so be there by 10 am or 2 pm if you want to see it. But we were able to go on the 11 am guided tour in English, it is free and it is the only way to know what you are seeing because most buildings look the same. The tour takes an hour and then you can walk around by yourself. It is very inexpensive, around $2.50 US unless you dress in traditional Korean clothes, then it is free.At the end exit towards the Seoul Library and walk to the Bukchon Hanok Village .","September 29, 2019"
"Very nice place, great to come over the weekend and see the local Koreans dressed on their traditional clothing ","September 29, 2019"
"Gyeongbokgung Palace was the royal palace of Joseon dynasty. Our tour guide, Erica, gave a detailed history of this dynasty and the sons fought with each other to occupy the throne and that lead to the construction of the other main palace. She explained about the summer and winter offices and rooms considering how hot and cold the temperature reaches during theses season in South Korea. Also, the change of guards is one of the major attractions of this palace. Don't miss it. Must visit.","September 28, 2019"
"An amazing, sprawling site you have to visit in Seoul. Get there by 10am on a weekday and you'll have a perfect view for the changing of the guard. it's an awesome show. Rent a traditional hanbok at a shop nearby, get in free and supercharge your instagram, yo.","September 28, 2019"
"Since we booked a nearby hostel, it was just a good walk from our place. The palaces are quite interesting which gives you an idea of how they used to lived during the old times.It was a good thing that it was not crowded when we visited so we really enjoyed the beauty of the place.","September 28, 2019"
"This Palace has some beautiful architecture & bugger structures than Seoul other palaces, but this makes it a lot busier. The buildings are set in a classic structure - as you pass through the biggest & most regal first, then lots of structures of lesser quality follow after with buildings & Court yards to either side.This Palace is easy to wander on your own without a guide.The route follows through to the National Folk Museum & also the is the National Museum of Korea at the side.

"Love this Palace in every season. The Main Royal Palace of the Joseon Dynasty - if you are going to visit just one cultural site on your visit to Seoul I would recommend the Gyeongbokgung Palace. You can tour on your own, help a student volunteer offering a tour, or join a free guided tour offered by the management office in English, Japanese, Chinese, or Korean. Entry is a reasonable 3000 for adults, 1,500 for juniors and free for under 6y or over 65y. Changing of the guard takes place at 1000 and 1400 inside the Gwanghwamun gate and Gate Guard duty performance outside the gate is at 1100 and 1300 daily. Even without seeing these performances wandering through is worthwhile, you can see the blue house from the far corner of the grounds, and the National Folk museum entrance is connected to the eastern side. Highly recommend to all - accessible and enough room for the little ones to get some energy out.","September 26, 2019"
Gyeongbokgung Palace itself was easy to find! (Stop at gyeongbokgung station). Rent a hanbok and you are able to enter for free !! I must say the palace is big and beautiful As for me i really want to visit the palace as i always seen it on tv so seeing it in real life is amazing! Its big that you need 2 hours to explore the whole area and there’s alot of pretty spots where you can take photos with your hanbok!! Definitely recommend to visit with your hanbok because you’ll feel like you are a princess/prince!! But of course there will be alot of tourist so come early so there not much people!,"September 26, 2019"
A wonderful slice of history brought to life. Probably most easily navigated for tourists as part of a city tour. Note that there's free entrance to the palace for people in tradition Hanbok dress.,"September 26, 2019"
This palace is a must-see if you are in Seoul for the first time. We visited on a national cultural day so many visitors had rented traditional clothing which made the visit even more colorful and entry was free this day. This palace is immense with many internal sections so plan on spending a few hours walking around the grounds. It is possible to rent headphones with a device where you point to a spot on the map and it gives you a detailed history (available in multiple languages). We witnessed the changing of the guard (at 10 am) which was a colorful event. The gardens and ponds in the back are serene and beautiful. There is also a museum full of national treasures from the Joseon Dynasty. Definitely worth a visit!,"September 25, 2019"
"If you're coming to Seoul, this place is a must see. The grounds are huge so be prepared to do a lot of walking. The view of the mountains is very majestic. You can rent a hanbok in nearby shops so you can enter for free which i highly recommend if you really want that Korean feel during your tour and take nice pictures in centuries old architecture. ","September 22, 2019"
"The palace is sooo big... and many photo spots in here. Bring your camera. And dont forget to watch guard ceremony @ 11.00 AM, and 14.00 PM ... ","September 22, 2019"
This castle was completed in 1395 shortly after the founding of the Joseon Dynasty. It was destroyed during the Japanese invasion of 1592 and was reconstructed in 1867.During the Japanese Occupation between 1910 and 1945 most of the buildings were torn down and work continues to fully restore the place since 1990. It is large and impressive and provides an interesting perspective of Korean history. It can get crowded but the grounds are extensive so it is not an issue.Access is via the Orange Line at Anguk or Gyeongokgung Stations.,"September 21, 2019"
"After a while the palaces start to look alike, but they each are beautiful in their own way. Best viewed in the winter or after a storm because the skies are usually cleared of smog and yellow dust. Take your time while walking around, take ur all in. ","September 21, 2019"
"If you are just looking to do what everyone ‘should do’ coming to Seoul, go there, rent a ‘traditional’ costume and take lots of selfies for your instagram posts.Otherwise stay away. Most of what you will see is less then 20 years old and there are so many dressed up tourists, it feels like carnival. There are much better places to get an impression of historical palaces.On the other hand, the two musea on site are worth it. One is focused on daily lives of Korean people through time and the other one boast a solid collection of the interiors of the palaces.","September 21, 2019"
We came here on a cloudy day and didn’t choose to go deep into the palace compounds by paying an entrance fee. Tourists were soaking in the atmosphere with their rented hanboks.,"September 21, 2019"

Nice and worthwhile visit to the best palace complex of the city.. Try to have a sunset visit that will give you a unique and less crowded experience,"September 17, 2019"
We recommend to visit this magnificent palace during weekends so that you can engage a volunteer tour guide to show you around the palace and giving you more insights into the Korean dynasty era. A nice place for history lovers! ,"September 17, 2019"
The interesting thing about the visit was we had to dress the traditional hanbok or Chosŏn-ot and visit the palace. We were lucky to arrive during the changing of the guards at 4 p.m. The changing of the guards are done twice a day in the mornings and evenings. ,"September 17, 2019"
"Very beautiful palace that is super huge with lots to explore! Very photogenic palace. My friend and I got our hanbok rental + photography services on Klook Travel. It was a great experience and we went home with a lot of lovely shots to remember the day. Do check out the weather forecast before going! It happened to be drizzling when we went, which made the hanbok skirts wet and difficult to walk in, but the air was really nice and cooling! I personally think I enjoyed it better with the drizzles than if it was a really hot sunny day. Just avoid pouring rain and bring an umbrella in case. Here's a lil more about the place :> Largest & most beautiful of the 5 Grand Palaces> Built in 1395> represented the sovereignty of Joseon DynastyEntrance Fee is 3k wonFREE for seniors over 65yo, visitors in hanbok (you can rent nearby) and on Culture Day (last Wed of the month)> Free guided tours in 4 languages between 10am - 4pm> 2 types of Guard changing ceremonies between 10am - 2pm (Changing of palace guard ceremony inside Gwanghwamun gate & Gate Guard duty performance outside Gwanghwamun gate)> FOOD TIP : There is a Tosokchon Samgyetang nearby which is very well known for their Korean Ginseng Chicken.

"A must-visit location in Seoul, portraying Korean architecture and culture. Try wearing hanbok (Korean traditional dress) while visiting the palace. ","September 16, 2019"
This is a fabulous place for anyone and everyone to explore Korea history. From the palace walls to the museum inside you definitely get a sense of what the old days were like and beauty that Korea has Architect wise. The price to enter is such a small amount $3 USD or free if you rent a hanbok- which I highly recommended for memorable pictures.,"September 15, 2019"
"The Gyeongbokgung Palace is an amazing experience and worth the visit when in Seoul! Step back into time more than 600 years to walk these grounds and take in all the history that makes this palace a “MUST VISIT”.! The grounds are vast with countless buildings, gates and walls to wonder around and take in all the aspects of Korean history and culture! Make sure you give yourself at least a couple hours for this one; it is spread out with lots to take in. Highly recommend.!!","September 15, 2019"
"Its a nice places to learn about the culture. You can try to use hanbok and the clothes are very pretty. Many foreigners as well as local use that during the visit. They have guard shift ceremony every 10 am and 2 pm, make sure not to miss this ceremony. The palace environment felt once you arrive the gyeongbokgung subway.","September 14, 2019"
"Wow. Visiting Gyeongbokgung Palace was the highlight on this one day tour. We felt as if we were transported back in time, by just walking through the Palace gate. It felt surreal for me. Seeing the size of the property and the designs certainly added to the mystique of the surroundings. The changing of the guards reminds me of British Palace tours, only more colorful and artsy. Added to the attraction were the visitors of all ages wearing rented traditional garbs. Amazingly awesome place to visit. We spent an hour here including visit to the National Folk museum situated on the same grounds. A must see when you go. ","September 14, 2019"

Step back into time more than 600 years to walk these grounds and take in all the history that makes this palace a “MUST VISIT”.! The grounds are vast with countless buildings, gates and walls to wonder around and take in all the aspects of Korean history and culture! Make sure you give yourself at least a couple hours for this one; it is spread out with lots to take in. Highly recommend.!!","September 15, 2019"
"Its a nice places to learn about the culture. You can try to use hanbok and the clothes are very pretty. Many foreigners as well as local use that during the visit. They have guard shift ceremony every 10 am and 2 pm, make sure not to miss this ceremony. The palace environment felt once you arrive the gyeongbokgung subway.","September 14, 2019"
"Wow. Visiting Gyeongbokgung Palace was the highlight on this one day tour. We felt as if we were transported back in time, by just walking through the Palace gate. It felt surreal for me. Seeing the size of the property and the designs certainly added to the mystique of the surroundings. The changing of the guards reminds me of British Palace tours, only more colorful and artsy. Added to the attraction were the visitors of all ages wearing rented traditional garbs. Amazingly awesome place to visit. We spent an hour here including visit to the National Folk museum situated on the same grounds. A must see when you go. ","September 14, 2019"
"We went in the morning with an organized tour group and we loved it. Admittedly, it always helps to have good weather and a clear, blue sky but the Palace grounds are very large and beautiful with plenty of different things to see. We also attended the Changing of the Guard ceremony which I would really recommend. I'd also recommend going with a tour guide because otherwise you'll be walking through the grounds not knowing what you see and you could get lost in this ""labyrinth"" and hence maybe miss some important buildings and stories. From the limited things I've seen in Seoul (it was a joint business/family 2-day trip), this was the highlight.","September 14, 2019"

"This Palace also houses the Korean National Palace Museum and the National Folk Museum.Because it was the biggest remaining Korean palace , the whole complex was systematically destroyed during the Japanese Occupation at the beginning of the 20th Century, and is slowly being rebuilt , including demolition of former Japanese government buildings to recreate the majestic Palace gateways! So everything you see today is very recent.","September 13, 2019"
"It was built prior to Forbidden City of China, but a bit smaller and maybe a bit simpler?Overall, enjoyed the changes of guard, even though they were all actors.

I'm happy tourists are allowed to view the grounds.Afterwards, I walked around the area and saw a huge protest at Gwanghwamun Square, which is a gathering place in front of the palace. I was told there something going on there almost daily. A further bit down the road and I ran into a Starbucks and then on to the tourist information center, where they were very helpful. I need an SD card for my phone and they called the nearby bookstore and inquired if they did indeed sell the cards as I had been told.

"Into every lengthy vacation this side of the Gobi, some rain must fall. My luck finally ran out on my last day in Seoul, with a thunderstorm intense enough to put Noah’s 40 days to shame. Nevertheless, I was determined to see one specific ghost-ridden spot within Gyeongbokgung, of world-wide historical importance, rain or no. Pelting rain at the vast complex in August does keep you cool. Distant rain-shrouded mountains turn grey and misty, like an ink painting come to life (see Heungnyemun and Geunjeongleon photos). Gyeonghoeru Pavilion’s roof blends with its rain-swept lake, and its red eaves and balconies take on an (appropriately for me) sombre tone (see Gyeonghoeru Pavilion and Gyeonghoeru Eaves photos). And the colourful interiors of the Geunjeongleon Throne Room and Sajeongjeon’s Hall of Worthies are bright by comparison (see Throne Hall and Hall of Worthies photos). At Gyeongbokgung, these are a thunderstorm’s sole virtues.I worried that the rain would scare away all the Hanbok Belles, one of the aesthetic joys of visiting any Korean palace. But the downpour didn’t deter the Belles from strutting their stuff in the national dress. Their attitude seemed to be “Rain, fiddlesticks! We’ve never met the rainstorm yet that could whip our hoop skirts!” (See Hanbok 1, Hanbok 2 and Hanbok 3 photos).And tears from Heaven were appropriate given my reason for being there. I was headed to the back of Gyeongbokgung, as far from the entrance and the crowds as you can go, to see Geoncheonggung Palace. A barbaric event occurred there: the sadistic butchering of Queen Min: usually called an “assassination” though that word doesn’t begin to capture the horror of the actual event. That crime on October 8th, 1895 started a half-century reign of terror, with consequences still hanging over us.Following the Meiji Restoration, Japanese nationalism generated militarism and a policy of foreign expansion. Expansion generally means war, but does not necessarily mean systematic and sadistic barbarity. For all World War I’s horrors, the French, British and Germans on the Western Front neither tortured prisoners of war nor systematically gang-raped their enemies’ young women. For years the Austro-Hungarian and Italian armies on the Isonzo Front scrupulously abided by the Hague Conventions. Even the first chess-move in Japan’s drive to expand, against China in 1894, was a relatively gentlemanly naval affair, though one-sided. Japan got Formosa, but the Western powers blocked them from getting the mainland Chinese territory they’d demanded. So Japan turned back to another target they’d long been eyeing: Korea. Korea’s timorous emperor could easily be coerced. Japan’s problem was that Empress Myeongseong, “Queen Min”, could not be. To counter Japanese instructors of Korean militia, Queen Min brought in military instructors from the USA. Queen Min strengthened relations with Tsarist Russia, Korea’s northern neighbour, as a counter to Japan. Queen Min even got the Chinese Customs Service extended into Korea. That internationally-run service honestly collected customs revenues and delivered those revenues to Peking, and now to Seoul as well, thus strengthening foreign relations, and funding military improvements. Tokyo had been within an ace of making Korea a Japanese puppet. Now Korea was fast slipping out of their fingers, all due to Queen Min, particularly when she ordered the disbanding of that Japanese-trained militia. Viscount Miura, one of Japan’s most senior statesmen, was dispatched to Korea to remedy this. Miura decided to make Korea’s emperor “an offer he couldn’t refuse.” In the middle of the night, on October 8th, 1895, Japan staged a military-style assault on the Geoncheonggung Palace. The attackers included some pro-Japan Korean traitors, but the hard core of the assault were 60 or so Japanese. The palace guards were overwhelmed and massacred. Miura’s Japanese agents caught up with Queen Min and her maids of honour as they were trying to escape through a patio. First Queen Min was repeatedly raped; then she was hacked with swords, and finally she was burned along with her maids of honour, possibly while some of them were still alive. The king fled in terror to the Russian legation, where he was given sanctuary. It was obvious that Miura had ordered the barbarism, and the whole world was outraged, including Japan’s powerful ally, Great Britain. Due to that, the Japanese government was compelled to put Miura on trial for the crime. Perhaps if they’d hung him, the hard-line faction in Tokyo would have been cowed. We’ll never know, because the trial was as outrageous as the crime. Miura freely admitted that he had ordered the crime. His defence attorney argued that Miura should be acquitted on the grounds that no act done in the national interest of Japan, no matter how grisly, could ever be criminal. The Japanese court then found Miura innocent on grounds of insufficient evidence! Miura was hailed and honoured as a national hero. What more encouragement could Japan’s most ruthless factions have gotten? The Japanese are NOT a nation of sadistic thugs; just as Germans, Spaniards and Turks aren’t, despite Auschwitz, the Inquisition, and the Armenian massacres. But in all these countries, for a while, the worst elements were in control. During the half-century after Queen Min’s assassination, there was always an opposition to the direction that Japan was headed. What Queen Min’s assassination and Miura’s acquittal did, was to terrifically boost the power and arrogance of the extremists. Over those next 50 years, even respected senior Japanese statesmen would be assassinated with impunity by them. A dark path was taken; it started here. It led to the the 300,000 victims of the Rape of Nanking, to the slaughter at Singapore’s Alexandria Hospital, the Bataan Death March, the horrors committed in Intramuros, the victims—perhaps hundreds of thousands of them—of Unit 731’s biological warfare testing; and the hundreds of thousands of sex slaves whose lives were destroyed: 80% of these “comfort women” were Korean. Jaoan’s path led to a 50-year road, then highway, then super-highway of ever-increasing horror, which was only stopped by the counter-horror of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Over the 50 years that Japan ruled Korea, the Japanese diligently demolished places that might evoke Korean nationalism. Most of Gyeongbokgung Palace wound up being knocked down, and needless to say, Queen Min’s palace was one of the first to go. Korea has worked slowly and steadily at rebuilding exact replicas of the heritage that its enemies demolished, including Geoncheonggung Palace. If you go there, I was assured that what you see is identical with what stood there on that night. And you really are standing on hallowed ground.You can go to lots of other assassination sites: Ghandi Smriti, the Church of the Savior on Blood, Dealey Plaza, even the spot in the Theatre of Pompey where Julius Caesar was done in by Brutus. But if I am correct that the assassination of Queen Min lit a fuse igniting 50 years of horrors in Asia, and leading ultimately to the Damocles sword of intercontinental nuclear war that now hangs over all of us, then I can think of only one other assassination spot on Earth that matches this one for historic significance: the memorial plaque just off the Latin Bridge in Sarajevo, where Franz Ferdinand and Sophie were killed.","August 31, 2019"

Over the 50 years that Japan ruled Korea, the Japanese diligently demolished places that might evoke Korean nationalism. Most of Gyeongbokgung Palace wound up being knocked down, and needless to say, Queen Min’s palace was one of the first to go. Korea has worked slowly and steadily at rebuilding exact replicas of the heritage that its enemies demolished, including Geoncheonggung Palace. If you go there, I was assured that what you see is identical with what stood there on that night. And you really are standing on hallowed ground.You can go to lots of other assassination sites: Ghandi Smriti, the Church of the Savior on Blood, Dealey Plaza, even the spot in the Theatre of Pompey where Julius Caesar was done in by Brutus. But if I am correct that the assassination of Queen Min lit a fuse igniting 50 years of horrors in Asia, and leading ultimately to the Damocles sword of intercontinental nuclear war that now hangs over all of us, then I can think of only one other assassination spot on Earth that matches this one for historic significance: the memorial plaque just off the Latin Bridge in Sarajevo, where Franz Ferdinand and Sophie were killed.","August 31, 2019"
"I really fell in love with Gyeongbokgung Palace.It's a big palace that shows the greatness of old Korean Kingdom.It's very easy see locals dressing in national costume: that's make the atmosphere even more magical.We also saw the changing of guard ceremony.Entrance ticket is cheap, only 3.000 won each.","August 30, 2019"

"Even though this is all reconstruction, it's a pleasant view into the past. As most of Korea was devastated by war, we were thrilled that this complex has been recreated. On the day of our visit, a Sunday, we were treated to scores of folks in traditional Korea dress which only added greatly to the charm. We spent approximately two hours strolling through the grounds and enjoyed it immensely. It was well worth the visit!","August 29, 2019"
"The palace is spread out over a large area and be prepared to do alot of walking. The map in English may not be accurate in identifying the different structures. For those who are conversant with Chinese characters, it's probably good to have the map with Chinese too as most of the structures have Chinese character names. The change of guard ceremony is interesting but not a must watch if you're short of time. Not allowed to enter most of the structures, can only view from outside. After a few of them, they all looked similar.","August 28, 2019"
"The palace is quite lovely. I took the train to Gyeongbokgung station and walked to the exit marked with ‘palace’, super easy to get too, two trains from Seoul Station. I walked around the palace grounds visiting the large number of buildings. The grounds were beautiful, I highly recommend this palace. ","August 21, 2019"
This is one of the sites within Seoul that you actually get a sense what the early Korean architecture and culture would have been like in the 1400s and later. Much of the country was later destroyed in various wars. It is very photogenic as many locals rent historical costumes to wear while they visit the palace. The palace covers a large area and you should count on at least an hour to walk and explore the grounds.,"August 21, 2019"

And then we got to enter the palace for free because of our hanbok attire. It was a great experience to see this historical landmark and wear traditional korean clothes!

The Royal Palace Museum is definitely a must if you would like to catch a glimpse into the past and the lives of those who used to live in Gyeongbukgung.

We got cute bookmarks, notes, even jewelries.Overall, it was a good place where you can have a leisurely stroll (even better if it's not too hot).","July 21, 2019"
This huge palace is a must see while in Seoul. Its got so much to see and is right in the middle of the city. Lots of people were dressed up in traditional korean attire. Great place for pictures and scenery or just for a nice long walk.,"July 26, 2019"
A history of Korean empire with. Beautiful architecture and surrounded by beautiful greenery.the cafeteria sitting place is very cute with wooden huts.,"July 25, 2019"
Worth a trip to see this attraction. Just check opening hours. We arrived at 6.30 and it was closed so had to waiting until it re opened at 7pm. Also the late opening did not allow entry to the two Koreans I was with. After 7pm is for foreign visitors and older Koreans so we found out on the day.,"July 24, 2019"
"A national treasure, but if you only visit one palace in Seoul, choose Changdeokgung Palace instead (I've left a review there, too). Gyeongokgung is gigantic, but in its current state feels empty. Actually, the museums inside were more interesting than the grounds themselves.","July 24, 2019"

"This palace is huge. The buildings are lovely. Not much to see inside them. Very cool though. Plan several hours if you want to see everything. The changing of the guards is something I only saw at this palace and was nice to see. Crowded toward the front, but far fewer people toward the back. Good view of the ""blue palace"" from the back gate. Gwanghwamun on the purple line is the subway stop I used.","July 23, 2019"

Its lovely to sit there and relax. Close second, and most people's favourite I'd say, is the majestic Geunjeongjon Hall which is the throne hall. The intricacy and colours are just mesmeric The King and Queens living quarters are lovely too and there is just so many lovely colourful and intricately decorated buildings around, not to mention scenic grounds.

Many female visitors are wearing the traditional dresses, which are great for photo shoots. Palace compound is huge, with many halls, rooms, quarters, pavilions etc. I spent about 1.5 hours exploring this compound.Time yourself to witness the changing of royal guards ceremony daily at 1000hr and 1400hr. Ceremony is held at the public square in front of the palace entrance. Hence, you can even watch this ceremony without purchasing the palace entrance ticket. If time permits, you can also visit the 2 nearby museums which are free admission, ie National Palace Museum of Korea and the National Folk Museum.","July 1, 2019"
"We went in for free because we were wearing hanbok. The palaces were well preserved. We did not find the main palace though, maybe because of the ongoing constructions. And the hanbok was a bit hot so we just left after we took some pictures. I am definitely going back there on colder days.","July 1, 2019"
"It was close to 20 years since I visited the palace for the first time and the government has done a great job in continually restoring the structures and grounds that originally were part of the expansive palace. Knowing this would be the most popular palace to visit, we avoided some of the expected crowds by arriving at the opening. Adults were 3000Won while our teens were 1500Won. The main buildings that were most interesting to us were:Geunjeongjeon - Large, elevated hall where the king greeted his subjects or guests. Visible from the outside was his throne and ornately painted ceiling and beams. This was the first building seen and most popular with the visiting crowds.Gyotaejeon - This was the queen's quarters but the garden in the back with chimneys was more interesting. While not currently landscaped, I could see how it would have been a scenic getaway for the queen from the rather plain palace grounds.Gyeonghoeru - The royal banquet hall was a two story building supported on massive stone columns was but only visible from across the pond. This was a popular backdrop for many tourists photos that day.More buildings that what I originally remember went on and on including one for the queen's mother, crown prince, and library. Our last stop was to see the Hwangwonjeong which was built on an artificial island and supposed to be quite beautiful but unfortunately was under reconstruction so all we got to see were the workers and a larger wall.We came back to the main courtyard to witness the colorful changing of the guards ceremony. Periodically, helpful announcements were broadcasted over the PA system to explain the activities or significance. This time, I viewed it from inside the courtyard where I witnessed more activities than previously from outside the gate (though having that backdrop was good for photo ops).After the ceremony ended, we visited the National Palace Museum which was on the otherside of the courtyard wall from the ceremony. That was a good escape from the heat as the day warmed up.","June 30, 2019"

"During the Korean Civil War (1950-53), Hanseong (Seoul today) was changed hands four times and everything in the City was destroyed by Air Raids and Bombs including the Palace of Chosun Dynasty.. The Main Gate of the Gyeongbokgung Palace was also totally destroyed. Now, the main gate of Gyeongbokgung Palace was rebuilt according to historic look and an tourist attraction event was performed at the Square behind and before the Palace. It is the Gate Guard Rotation Ceremony Show. Everyday, except closed day, has two sections. Morning section at 10 am and afternoon section at 2 pm. No admission fee necessary. Be reminded that you shud come before commenced otherwise you can not enter the Gate during the show. For preview, you can check the >30 seconds videos at map sites of Gyeongbokgung Palace Korea and Gwanghwamun or 12 minutes video at my tube.One very generous move here is free admission to the Palace for all elders of 65 and above, including foreighners.","June 27, 2019"

"If you only have time to visit one palace, I recommend this one. It is the largest of the 5 palaces and most impressive. Expect this palace you be crowded. Many female visitors are wearing the traditional dresses, which are great for photo shoots. Palace compound is huge, with many halls, rooms, quarters, pavilions etc. I spent about 1.5 hours exploring this compound.Time yourself to witness the changing of royal guards ceremony daily at 1000hr and 1400hr. Ceremony is held at the public square in front of the palace entrance. Hence, you can even watch this ceremony without purchasing the palace entrance ticket. If time permits, you can also visit the 2 nearby museums which are free admission, ie National Palace Museum of Korea and the National Folk Museum.","July 1, 2019"
"We went in for free because we were wearing hanbok. The palaces were well preserved. We did not find the main palace though, maybe because of the ongoing constructions. And the hanbok was a bit hot so we just left after we took some pictures. I am definitely going back there on colder days.","July 1, 2019"
"It was close to 20 years since I visited the palace for the first time and the government has done a great job in continually restoring the structures and grounds that originally were part of the expansive palace. Knowing this would be the most popular palace to visit, we avoided some of the expected crowds by arriving at the opening. Adults were 3000Won while our teens were 1500Won. The main buildings that were most interesting to us were:Geunjeongjeon - Large, elevated hall where the king greeted his subjects or guests. Visible from the outside was his throne and ornately painted ceiling and beams. This was the first building seen and most popular with the visiting crowds.Gyotaejeon - This was the queen's quarters but the garden in the back with chimneys was more interesting. While not currently landscaped, I could see how it would have been a scenic getaway for the queen from the rather plain palace grounds.Gyeonghoeru - The royal banquet hall was a two story building supported on massive stone columns was but only visible from across the pond. This was a popular backdrop for many tourists photos that day.More buildings that what I originally remember went on and on including one for the queen's mother, crown prince, and library. Our last stop was to see the Hwangwonjeong which was built on an artificial island and supposed to be quite beautiful but unfortunately was under reconstruction so all we got to see were the workers and a larger wall.We came back to the main courtyard to witness the colorful changing of the guards ceremony. Periodically, helpful announcements were broadcasted over the PA system to explain the activities or significance. This time, I viewed it from inside the courtyard where I witnessed more activities than previously from outside the gate (though having that backdrop was good for photo ops).After the ceremony ended, we visited the National Palace Museum which was on the otherside of the courtyard wall from the ceremony. That was a good escape from the heat as the day warmed up.","June 30, 2019"

"During the Korean Civil War (1950-53), Hanseong (Seoul today) was changed hands four times and everything in the City was destroyed by Air Raids and Bombs including the Palace of Chosun Dynasty.. The Main Gate of the Gyeongbokgung Palace was also totally destroyed. Now, the main gate of Gyeongbokgung Palace was rebuilt according to historic look and an tourist attraction event was performed at the Square behind and before the Palace. It is the Gate Guard Rotation Ceremony Show. Everyday, except closed day, has two sections. Morning section at 10 am and afternoon section at 2 pm. No admission fee necessary. Be reminded that you shud come before commenced otherwise you can not enter the Gate during the show. For preview, you can check the >30 seconds videos at map sites of Gyeongbokgung Palace Korea and Gwanghwamun or 12 minutes video at my tube.One very generous move here is free admission to the Palace for all elders of 65 and above, including foreighners.","June 27, 2019"

It’s a big place with long heritage and old construction building. But I have been to Beijing Forbidden Palace. The construction heritage and treasures of this palace just can’t compare to that,"June 8, 2019"
"We really liked that the Palace provided free guided tours in English which helped us learn and understand the different structures within the complex, and the life of the Korean royals back in the day. This is especially interesting to those who watch K-Dramas.","June 12, 2019"
"One of the key cultural attractions of Korea in my opinion! There are many shops around the palace that rent traditional clothing especially to go to the palace, so that's what I did (foreigners are wlecomed to do so!). I loved walking around the castle and taking pictures. There are many tourists inside the main court but of you venture into the gardens behind the castle it gets less crowded. ","June 12, 2019"
Feel the pulse of the bustling capital of South Korea. This picturesque palace is the first royal palace built in 1395 during the time of the Joseon dynasty.,"June 12, 2019"

"Still one of the places to visit when you are in Seoul. The palace is so intricately made and the mountain at the back is so amazing. However, it is so big but there is only 1 or 2 toilets nearby.","June 10, 2019"
"The original palace dates back to the 1300s but various invasions by the Japanese in the 1500s, 1800s and 1910 has meant a lot fo the original palace has been destroyed. Much of the palace is reproductions of the original buildings but the architecture is still very impressive. Be equipped with walking shoes and headwear as the palace is quite expansive and exposed","June 9, 2019"
"We visited the palace on the last Wednesday of the month, so the admission was free. However, a fee is charged for the guided tour. The palace area was large.

"We had a beautiful and enjoyable experience here. Rented a hanbok from nearby and took photos and videos in this Unesco heritage site. It was a really nice day. Come with a full stomach as food is not allowed inside. Or have snacks outside by the exit before or after. We enjoyed the dumpling shop and CU store, in our hanbok :-) Well kept and beautiful Palace. Staff in Secret Garden was kind and helped us on our way, especially when we were last in the group.

Make sure you find a spot in the crowds near to the roped off area so that you can see what's going on. The palace grounds are vast.

We visited the palaces at the end of February. It was a freezing cold day and we got to the palaces very early so that we could get in before they got too crowded with school groups and other tourists. We wanted to get the palace pass for 10000 won which would allow you to visit 5 palaces and shrines in the Seoul but unfortunately we found out that the other main palace - Changdeokgung with the secret garden - is closed on Mondays so we just decided to purchase the single palace pass. It was a lovely day with some incredible architecture and history we read from the English provided guide book. We also managed to watch the changing of the guard at around 10am which was a cool experience. There is a narrator who explains the whole ceremony in English so that was a plus. We spend most of the morning walking around the palace and also made a quick stop in the Korean folk museum which is just alongside the palace. Would definitely recommend doing both palaces if you can and coming during a warmer month where all the grass and tress have bloomed as it is much prettier during this time.,"May 14, 2019"
Entry was cheap. Went in the weekend and even though it was very crowded but the area is more than big enough. Lots of good photo spots. Many people were getting their pictures taken.,"May 13, 2019"
This palace has many buildings and extensive grounds. If you rent a traditional Hanbok costume (shops at exit 2 of the subway) entrance is then free. You can wander on your own or take a guided tour. We chose to go it alone and had a great time.,"May 13, 2019"
If you are visiting Korea you must visit Gyeongbokgung! You can dress in Hanbok (Korean traditional dress) to gain free access to the palace. There are many Hanbok rental places just outside the palace which is convenient,"May 16, 2019"
I went here to see changing of the guards. It is different to what I expected! There is announcements in English so you understand what is going on. If you enter through the main gate stand on the right they will go out the gate and come back in. ,"May 16, 2019"
Palace within palace which for this palace there is chinese character written around it and kinda confuse me but still a great place to spend time and taking memories down the road by wearing their costumes which can be rented,"May 16, 2019"
A very historic place worth the visit to learn about Korean culture and history. It is one of the must see sites in Korea ,"May 16, 2019"
"Mr Paul Chang’s Korea Wheelchair tour was engaged for our vacation in Seoul. He is exceptionally experience and professional when it came to helping my aged father in wheelchair.His dedication and commitment to helping my father was admirable. For those who have mobility challenges and wish to explore tourist attractions with vast areas, do consider hiring Mr Chang. ","May 14, 2019"
The scale of the Palace is amazing. On the day we went there were children dressed in traditional clothes celebrating a festival,"May 14, 2019"
Beautiful palace. One of the largest I’ve seen. You can even dress up an the traditional Korean garb and take pictures. A lot of the locals seem to do this. Parking was easy and relatively cheap. Definite must see if in Korea.,"May 14, 2019"
We visited the palaces at the end of February. It was a freezing cold day and we got to the palaces very early so that we could get in before they got too crowded with school groups and other tourists. We wanted to get the palace pass for 10000 won which would allow you to visit 5 palaces and shrines in the Seoul but unfortunately we found out that the other main palace - Changdeokgung with the secret garden - is closed on Mondays so we just decided to purchase the single palace pass.

You will be surprise when you arrive in this place. The palace is so huge and you will feel that you live in Joseon dynasty era especially you wear tradional korea custum (Hanbook Cloth) and go around the palace. The hanbook cloth can be rented in nearby palace area.,"May 10, 2019"

We got here at around 1pm just in time for the last Changing of Guards. Great to see part of Korea's history and culture. There were too many tourist at the time of our visit that it's too hard to take a photo without photobombers LOL. ,"May 9, 2019"
"We visited the palace at 5pm on a Monday. It was very busy but large enough to escape the crowds in the trails walking around the gardens. What wasn't great was from 5:30pm onwards, every 5 minutes, a loud voice over a speak system would usher us to the leave the palace asap as it was closing. This was the opposite of peaceful and made us feel like we were in some kind of theme park. I understand why this is necessary with 1,000s of visitors each day but if you're looking for a nice peaceful experience, I suggest you leave enough time to escape before 30 minutes before closing.","May 9, 2019"
"Nice view of the palace with the old and new, the changing of the guard and many people in costumes. It was friendly with a very nice walk and we had a good time even with our 9 year old. Lots of things to see and lots of pictures to take. Very nice walk.","May 8, 2019"

"I traveled here with a friend of mine who used to live and teach English in Korea. She took me to the palace and I was blown away by how massive the grounds are, let alone the beautiful reconstruction of the architecture (sadly, only 10% has remained to this day). I dressed in the traditional hanbok attire and got in for free (although it cost me $20 for 2 hours just for the experience, otherwise it's 3,000 Korean Won or ~$3 for entry). It was neat seeing the ""changing of the guards"" which happens every hour in the enormous entryway before entering the palace itself. We went during the off-season, but it was still packed because it's Buddah's birthday in early May, so festivals and people were abound in preparation for it. I highly recommend visiting this palace over others for those who are baffled by the options. ","May 6, 2019"
"This was a fun place to visit but there are a lot of open spaces with nothing to see. At the time of our visit there was construction going on so it blocked off parts of the grounds but there was also some mini-experiences that you could walk through to see what life might have been like a few hundred years ago. Overall the grounds are very beautiful and it takes time to walk around them. There are lots of good photo spots and about half the people there had rented the formal outfits of Korea’s past. Cost was very cheap to get in. I will say nothing was flat on the inside, little ones that are just learning to walk had a lot trouble.","May 6, 2019"
"This a beautiful ""must see"" place to visit located in the middle of the city. Very interesting to learn about Korean history in the museum and all the houses on the grounds.

"We spent about two hours exploring the beautiful grounds of Gyeongbokgung. The entrance fee of 3,000 korean won was waived as we wore traditional Korean hanboks.It was quite crowded with both locals and foreigners, but we were able to find some quiet spaces. There is a guard changing ceremony twice a day in the main square, which is pretty cool and also the perfect time to see the grounds as most visitors will be watching the ceremony. You can also join in the free guided tours that are offered several times a day in English, Chinese, and Japanese.It was a pretty enjoyable experience, and it transitions nicely into a view of the Blue House, where the President of South Korea resides, and a stroll through the traditional neighborhood of Bukchon.

Only 3000 Won entry. £2 or $2.50 US. Very reasonable for entry to such a beautiful place. Changing of the gaurd takes place outside the charged section so it's completely free.

"We got there by taxi and realized that because of its central location many other attractions were within walking distance. The queues were long for the entrance tickets and some people approached us offering Hanbok rentals since wearing one grants you free entrance to the cultural attractions. The rental wasn't worth it considering the starting price was 10,000 won while the entrance only cost 3,000 won. If you're going to +3 places that have entrance fees then it might be worth it there's also a penalty for late returns. Inside the Palace we saw tons of cherry blossoms in full bloom. We rushed to the front entrance when we heard the drums for the changing of the guards but we couldn't properly appreciate it since the crowd was huge and we could only watch from a distance.

"for first time visitors,try renting hanbok and explore the whole place while taking pictures.its hard to beat the crowd but there are parts of the palace that are less crowded..it took us maybe 2 hours to explore this wonderful palace while taking hundreds of pictures.","April 27, 2019"
"If you're a foreigner, you go into a foreigner-only queue where you pay a full-rate entry price to view the palace. If you are Korean, you go into a Korean-only line where you pay a special, discounted rate. This is typical of a foreigner vs. Korean mentality you find in many places in Korea, but it was surprising to experience this as a foreigner at such a big tourist destination.","April 27, 2019"
A very interesting experience. Good value for money and very easy to get to. Beautiful buildings and really well kept grounds.,"April 26, 2019"
"I came here from Chunjeongno Stn, commuting a public bus. It took me only 20 minutes to arrive here. wonderful place. entrance fee just 3000 krw per person but If you rent their Hanbok , you will get a free entrance. Goodlucl","April 25, 2019"
Only 3000 Won entry. £2 or $2.50 US. Very reasonable for entry to such a beautiful place. Changing of the gaurd takes place outside the charged section so it's completely free. The 10am one is less busy. Perfectly timed to then take the 11am English tour around the palace. We absolutely loved it. Informative and friendly lady who guided us around in perfect English with subtle humour also. Highly recommend,"April 25, 2019"
"We got there by taxi and realized that because of its central location many other attractions were within walking distance. The queues were long for the entrance tickets and some people approached us offering Hanbok rentals since wearing one grants you free entrance to the cultural attractions. The rental wasn't worth it considering the starting price was 10,000 won while the entrance only cost 3,000 won. If you're going to +3 places that have entrance fees then it might be worth it there's also a penalty for late returns. Inside the Palace we saw tons of cherry blossoms in full bloom. We rushed to the front entrance when we heard the drums for the changing of the guards but we couldn't properly appreciate it since the crowd was huge and we could only watch from a distance.

"Easy walking, beautiful surroundings you can get into palaces free if you are in traditional dress, it was lovely to see so many doing this. It was a large palace but not too crowded","April 24, 2019"
"This palace is in the same grounds as the Folk museum and, luckily I visited in Springtime when all of the cherry trees were in full bloom. It was built for the founder of the Joseon Dynasty, destroyed by the Japanese in the 16th century and rebuilt in the 19thC. It has four gates leading to it, the most important being the southern gate outside which there is daily a colourful changing of the guard ceremony.","April 24, 2019"

"We went with a youth guide who we met while exiting the metro station. He gave us a nice tour of the place lasting almost 2 hrs. Crowds aplenty, many were dressed in traditional costumes from one of the many shops nearby. Do catch the changing of the guard.","April 22, 2019"
Was good experience to walk around the palace in hanbok and admire the cherry blossom and scenery. Have an enjoyable morning walking around with many photo taking places,"April 22, 2019"
"Incredible palace. Totally different, then what we have in Europe. Mistical place full of the spirit of the old times. Great initiative of the young people to be the tour guide for free and in the same time to practice English. You can rent or buy the dresses from the royal family time, walk in palace and feel like a queen or king. Fully recommended for all families.","April 22, 2019"
"If you love museums, as we do, this is the place to go. The main event is the palace grounds. Though reconstructed, it give you an idea of royal life. Second, on the grounds (but I don't think you have to enter the palace to get there) is the National Palace Museum, which tells more of the story about what went on in the palace. Third, and my favorite, is the National Folk Museum, also free and outside the palace itself. This is where you learn how regular people lived - clothing, making kimchi, village life, etc. Finally, tucked away in a small building on the north perimeter is a library of material about the palace and the Josean Dynasty. All the signage throughout all the museums are in English. ","April 22, 2019"
"The palace is huge and you can find lots of picture-worthy spots. For entrance, you ca choose to rent costumes (hanbok/traditional korean attire) or buy entrance tickets. If you choose to rent hanbok, entrance will be included already, this option however, is more expensive compared to the regular entrance fee but you get to experience wearing hanbok and you will definitely enjoy taking pictures with it. Recommended time is 1 to 2 hours depending on travel speed. ","April 21, 2019"
"Arrived here at 2 pm and very crowded because many visitors from locals and foreigner. Cost me 3000 Won per person (free of charge for people using hanbok). There's a guardian changing ceremony at 10 am and 2 pm. But it's not a real guardian, only some actor (but they do it very very serious and nice to watch). This palace is very large, but never empty of visitors since it's the main palace. Oh good thing is this object provide free locker where we can put our bag. It's located near from the entrance.

If you want the more good quality hanbok it is either you rent or just buy. In doing so , the government was able to highlight their culture . Many would love doing their photo ops for social media motives. Place is huge , so just causally move around . By the way , at the start of the tour is the changing of the guard .

We received a discounted Senior entrance fee which can obtain by showing your passport.The palace itself is massive and even though there were large crowds, we never felt crushed due to the expanse of this palace. Perhaps the most enjoyable aspect of the visit, however, was experiencing the throngs of Korean people who dressed up in the traditional Honok attire. It was simply gorgeous and the pride in which the individuals wore there garb was evident. It truly takes you back in time when you see people in traditional dress and being on those grounds made it even more special.

"A beautiful palace, which unfortunately got caught in a fire in the 1800’s then was ruled by the Japanese for about 50 years. The Japanese tore it all down but fortunately stored a lot of the structures. They have spent the last 30 years, restoring and repair the palace, so not much of it looks very old but it is amazing when you read the history. The changing of the guard is a nice ceremony to watch. It is great to visit during cherry blossom as it all looks so pretty. ","April 9, 2019"
It was great to watch the changing of the guards ceremony & to wear the Hanbok traditional dress for the occasion. Lovely photos with the beautiful palace buildings & environment. Worth the visit. ,"April 9, 2019"

A interesting venue but best explored with a guide as more information about the many buildings can be explained in detail. The plaques erected all through the palace are also written in English which is great if you are not local.

The old architecture in the backdrop of a modern city is lovely to see. While I enjoyed I went and saw it I wouldn’t go again . It’s peaceful place to hang out and look around for an hour or so that was good enough for me.,"April 4, 2019"

You may spare a day to explore the whole location. Best spot is small lake (pond) inside the center area,"April 4, 2019"
Arrived at 9 when they opened and was able to enjoy the grounds in relative solitude along with the other early birds. By the time we left at around 11 the crowds were arriving. Amazing architecture and history especially with the hustle bustle of the city as a backdrop. Nice changing of the guard ceremony as well. ,"April 3, 2019"

"Like many of sites in Seoul a lot of the place was destroyed by the Japanese, A lot has been rebuilt to the original architecture, Only down side 95% of the buildings are empty, so gets a bit boring just look at the outside walls which all have the same decor. On highlight is the changing of the place guard ceremony twice a day except Mondays, If you are over 65 take a copy of your passport or other proof of age as its free entry.

This is a much larger and more colorful attraction than I imagined. I do recommend visiting here in a rented Hanbok because the setting is just so gorgeous for photos and it is not an overcrowded site. However 2 hours is a standard minimum Hanbok Rental time from most shops near the Anguk subway station and it was just barely enough time to walk to place and through grounds. Rent for 4 hours! Entrance the palace is free - just walk through gate. We lucky to catch blooming cherry blossoms as well!,"April 1, 2019"
"Always great to see history. This palace was originally built in the 1300's. We were on a city tour with a tour guide and they provided so much insite that you may have missed if visiting on your own.The buildings were built with such detail work and awesome colors. Lots of space to move about even though there is quite a crowd. There is a changing of the guard to see at specified times. Worth the wait to see it, but this is a ceremonal bit, not true militiary/security.I would call this a must see in Seoul. However, I would suggest if you have limited time, to see only one palace. The Changdeokgung Palace is almost exactly the same as this one.If you have time, exit the front of the place and walk straight out and see the statues of King Sejong and Admiral Yi Sunshin. These are two very important figures on the history of Korea.There is also a little known museum dedicated to the two of them under the statues. This is a nice secret spot to learn more history.The shops around the palace rent clothing of the era and many visitors rent the clothing and visit the palace. I am told if you were clothing from the era, you enter free. FYI, the entrance fee is very minimal.I highly reccomend visiting one of the palaces if visiting Seoul. A visit to the Buddist Temple is also a must!","March 31, 2019"
"We walked the entire park. Beautiful buildings. No one there to talk about any of them. Cannot see inside at all. A few doors open to look at empty spaces with painted walls but most areas doors locked and cannot see inside. No furniture, no mats. Do not get a feel for how they lived many years ago. There is construction going on in some area which were completely blocked off. I was disappointed because I wanted a sense of how the family lived their lives during that time period.

"This palace epitomizes how the old and new blend together in modern Seoul: a sprawling centuries-old palace that is located nearby today's government complexes. The palace is a must-see at least once while in Seoul. A big plus is that it is free entry for everyone into the Gwanghwamun Gate, to witness the daily Guard Changing Ceremony (10am and 2pm daily except Tuesday), and even to enter the National Palace Museum of Korea where there are so many historical exhibits to see. You will be amazed how vast and rich Korea's history is! We did not enter the main palace grounds itself based on our time limit.

"Gyeongbokgung palace, the obvious seat of government in older times, is a showpiece for the city, staring down at the city's main avenue through the reconstructed Gwanghwamun gate, giving it the proper sightlines so important in eastern palace layouts. Being the main palace in Seoul, it features a number of displays, including performers in traditional dress showing various aspect of court pageantry. Also worth visiting is the folk museum within.The detailing and shape of the roofs are unique, and the large number of carved stone figures, some of them unfortunately encased in transparent boxes due to unruly visitors, interesting indeed.

Gorgeous with so much architecture and history to appreciate. Lots of other awesome things nearby to see and do such as The Blue House (White House equivalent). Dress comfortably, one can easily spend a while exploring. You can rent traditional Korean clothing (Hanbok) to wear when you visit from one of the nearby shops. See if you can catch the changing of the guard ceremony. ","March 24, 2019"

"The Gyeongbokgung Palace is extremely huge, similar to some of the palaces in China. There are many places inside the palace to take amazing photos. There are small signs around the palace with brief descriptions of the buildings in the palace, however, the descriptions are not very detailed and if you are truly interested in learning more about the Gyeongbokgung Palace, you should probably follow the guided-tours.There’s also a guard changing ceremony daily at 1000 and 1400 hours.

There are also guides with different languages at scheduled timings. ","March 22, 2019"

Being and older blondie, I copped a few stares and compliments, but had super fun. It is really a series of buildings that you wander around. Pretty wheelchair accessible, there are ramps over entrances etc. I highly recommend the museum that is attached. It is well set out and very interesting.

"If you had enough time to visit just one palace in Seoul, this would be the one. Gyeongbokgung is the main royal palace of the Joseon Dynasty. Most of the visit focuses on building exteriors, grounds and courtyard though there are some buildings where you can look in through the door and snap a few photos. Do consider the free guided tour that occurs throughout the day (1-1.5 hours) as well as the Changing of the Palace Guard Ceremony at 10:00 and 14:00. There is also a Gate Guard Duty performance at 11:00 and 13:00. And of course, you can always rent the popular hanbok attire for photo ops at nearby shops.","February 18, 2019"
"the palace is large but most of the rooms are closed hence one gets to see the outer structures only. a self guide facility should be made available to understand the buildings better, fairly large and hence needs an easy 2-3 hours visit","February 16, 2019"

It is in front of the main gate, before you enter the palace. Also, you can see the Blue House from a distance.

Be aware that the museum on the left as you enter is free (and also worth it) but there is one further in that has a cost of I believe 3000 won.If you can go in the winter you may even be able to see the frozen lake which is a great photo opportunity!,"January 16, 2019"
Your visit to Seoul Korea is not complete unless you visit the Palace wearing the traditional dress called Hanbok while walking around the Palace and witness the changing of the guard. ,"January 15, 2019"
"I’ve been living in Korea for almost 5 years now, and I still visit the palace on a regular basis. Mainly when visitors come as a major site for them to see, but it never ceases to amaze me. It’s stunning and takes a good long while to walk around and take in the beauty, and for only 3,000₩ it’s a great deal for something to do on a low budget. ","January 15, 2019"
"A beautiful palace indeed. I personally enjoy historical thing, so I was really happy with my visit to Gyeongbokgung Palace. The place is very big, so you have to prepare yourself with long walk if you want to see everything. Nad they offer free english guided tour at specified time for around 1.5 hours which I think quite worth it.","January 15, 2019"
Get to the palace early to catch the first change of guards ceremony. There are also tour guides in the different languages that will bring you round the palace. The tour guide we had was hilarious and made the tour even more enjoyable.,"January 15, 2019"

The palace is a very popular with locals and tourists and things were very busy when we were there. The grounds are extensive and well worth a leisurely stroll. The buildings have been lovingly maintained and are in excellent condition - they don't show their age (built in 1300s) at all!,"January 14, 2019"
"We went on December 30 and the weather was cold but sunny. We went early in the morning as we purchased a hambok rental experience that said we needed to be there between 9:30 and 10:30. If you want to do the rental and see the palace, I do recommend going earlier to beat the crowds. The palace is massive! When I watch K-dramas, these palaces are featured, but I didn't imagine how large the property would be. The buildings themselves are impressive. There are a few showcases of rooms that you can view from the outside. There was also a cafe and restrooms available. It was just fun to walk around in costume and take beautiful and memorable pictures. I read the other reviews that recommended the changing of the guard. The one at 10:00 a.m. was cancelled when we were there, but we were able to view the one at 2:00 p.m. It was quite colorful and beautiful to watch. It lasts for about 20 minutes. If you have time, explore Bukchon Hanok Village on your own afterwards, as it isn't far and it's a beautiful walk around the neighborhood. If you can, time it just before sunset. It's gorgeous.","January 12, 2019"
"A huge place, to start with. I was in their hanbok so I got free entry. If you chose to wear traditional korean outfits, you are entitled to a free entry in to not only Gyeongbokgung, but Changedeokgung, Changyeonggung and Jongmyo Shrine. (Those were the places I went.)Didn't had enough time to actually explore the entire Gyeongbokgung but would come back for more - leisure strolls!","January 12, 2019"

"The Palace is in fact a complex of buildings and gardens, with space in between. Closed on Tuesdsay! Can be easily explored in a few hours. The buildings are relatively new, much was destroyed in the many wars of Korea, but have been rebuilt in style. The changing of the guards near the entrace gate is a colourful spectacle, a few times of the day. Check for timing. Some of the buildings are in fact large halls, with colourful paintings and some sculptures, that one can look at from the outside, but not enter. Other buildings can be wandered through; those are spare and not very interesting. The museum for Folk Art is part of the complex, with separate admission. When finished with the palace, one can walk (approx. 20 minutes) to the Bukchon Hanok Village, a collection of relatively well preserved (often renovated) traditional houses along narrow lanes.

Although we are a party of seven, we could have paid for only 3 adults and one child, as the 2 seniors and the child of five years ago were free.After the Change of Guards ceremony, we joined the free tour, which started at 10.30am, for Chinese language. The tour guide was very knowledgeable and very patient with answering questions from the tourists. The explanations were very clear and she did the delivery in an interesting way. History is not necessarily a boring thing if you have someone good at explaining them. Good job to the lady tour guide! ","December 20, 2018"
Very highly recommend.Amazing tour. Make sure you attend the guard switching ceremony.Better visitor with a guide to learn about the history.,"December 20, 2018"
The Royal Palace is a short distance walk from our hotel. It was very busy on our day of the visit but the palace area is vast so have plenty of areas to move and walk about and don't really feel crowded. There are many individual 'gates' within the complex but they are all spread out including some in the quiet corners too.,"December 20, 2018"

"The place is quite big, but guide maps are provided as well as English tours (we just walked around on our own, it was good enough). The performances are VO-ed in English and Mandarin.As we walked along the corridors, scenes from K period dramas I've watched flashed before my eyes haha! Most of the buildings are not the original (no thanks to the Japanese occupation during the war) but rebuilt. They are absolutely beautiful, with gorgeous artwork and minute attention to detail. Later, I watched Monstrum and when they mentioned the name of the hall, I told myself, hey! I've been there!Oh we saw a few Korean young ladies dressed in beautiful hanbok taking pictures? videos? in some of the quieter grounds. Not sure what they were trying to achieve but they were taking turns to run down a stretch and turn around or something. Rather interesting and funny, hee.","December 19, 2018"
"Great picturesque location, even in winter months as water becomes iced and trees shed leaves. Enjoyed the time out with the family. Downside for visits in winter months is that the place is all outdoors. Limited heating areas (only the cafe close to exit). Otherwise a good place for learning Korean history and taking beautiful pictures with the mountains in the background of the palace. ","December 18, 2018"

"To be fair, all the buildings that we can see today are accurate replica. The original palace was burnt to ground in 1592. Several buildings were restored in 1890s, while the rest were reconstructed in last 20 years. So, the palace actually contains less historical value compares to Changdeokgung and Deoksugung. However, the Gyeongbokgung is the original ruling palace of Joseon Kings. That attracted us to visit the palace, to see to prosperity and greatness of the Korean Dynasty at its best.The palace is huge, so allocate at least one to two hours to walk around the compound while enjoy the beauty of the gardens, especially in autumn. Wearing comfortable shoes can ensure a good time walking through the ground with sand and uneven stone tiles. There are a few stairs to climb as well. Checking the weather forecast is important so that we can bring an umbrella in case of raining. We found only one cafe available at the souvenir shop. So we need to bring enough water to keep us hydrated if we are planning to stay long in the palace.","December 12, 2018"

"Gyeongbokgung continued to serve as the main palace of the Joseon dynasty until the premises were destroyed by fire during the Imjin War (1592–1598) and abandoned for two centuries.

"If you only have time to visit one of Seoul’s grand palaces, I would recommend this palace. If at all possible, time your visit for either 10 AM or 2 PM for the changing of the guard. You won’t even need to buy an admission ticket to see the guards as they will perform just inside the main gate. About 20 minutes before the above hours the guards will be marching outside the grounds to the changing area. They will be playing drums so you’ll know. Grab a spot outside the blue nylon “crowd control belts” for the best photo opportunities. If you wait too long you’ll be behind 2-4 people. Keep in mind if you’re expecting something similar to Buckingham Palace you may be mildly disappointed. I would estimate there are only about 25-50 marchers/musicians. Still, it’s a wonderful exhibition. ","November 14, 2018"

We arrived in time for the changing of guards ceremony. After watching the ceremony and taking photos we proceeded to rent some Hanbok to wear. We easily found one near the gate. Rent the hanbok for 4 hours so we have an ample time to explore. The place is big enough that you have enough private space even though there were a lot of people during our visit. Lots of areas for photo ops with all the traditional Korean architecture all around. We came during autumn so the colors of the leaves enhances more the beauty of the palace. There were also lots of tourist that came in hanbok. Definitely had a great time with this experience.,"November 9, 2018"

"other reviews have summarized the palace nicely so i'll just add a few extra points:- changing of the guard happens twice daily. i saw the morning change and the route goes from the side door by the ticket booth to the front main entrance at gwanghwamun gate, with most of the action taking place in the middle aisle approaching the gate. situate yourself accordingly.- attempted to use the discover seoul pass for palace entry and we were denied by two different ticketing agents. it's only 3000 krw though so paying the entrance fee wasn't an issue. just a heads up for others using the pass!- didn't join a tour group because of time constraints but if you have the time to wander the grounds slowly, i'd suggest joining a free tour group! you'll get even more insight than just from the pamphlets. - while there are some ramps available, the grounds as a whole aren't very wheelchair friendly. i saw a few elderly tour groups struggling to push people in wheelchairs over the stone pathways. i can see the terrain and general layout of many thresholds and stairs as being a hazard for people using canes, walkers, and other mobility aids.","November 3, 2018"

It seems that the palace internal design and its layout looks pretty much similar. If you are one who watched quite a few of those Korea’s ancient drama, you will feel that those drama scene came alive in front of you. There’s a national museum (just right when you came out of the station) which is free admission. Personally, I find it really interesting as you get to know the rich history of Korea in the past. Further ahead (right besides the museum), there’s a park (at least that’s what I think it is) where you will see a big massive big yellowish tree. Many people who rented the traditional hanbok costume will be taking pictures at there. It was really some nice scene and relaxing. ","October 28, 2018"

My own opinion, if you would like to take more photos then try not to follow the guide, we drop the group half way so that our time is more flexible and no need to rush, remember the palace is very big, it is not easy to finish the tour and then walk all the way back to the place that you want to take photos.","October 28, 2018"
"It was my second time visiting this palace and it was still a wonder to the eyes. It is very large and touring around it will take more than an hour. This is one of the more famous filming sites in Korea. If you are lucky, there are also ceremonies which you will get to see live for free.

There were a lot of people around but the grounds are really impressively big and I never felt being in an overcrowded situation. Indeed, the deeper you walk north towards the Bukaksan mountain, the thinner the crowds become. I found myself walking though some Palace buildings completely on my own. I wasn't worried by the paucity of information in the English language. I navigated around with a small pamphlet available near the entrance and dipped into the internet whenever I needed special information like details about the alleged gruesome assassination of Queen Myeongseong by Japanese assassins.Indeed it's worth noticing that this ""Brilliance and Fortune"" Palace (Gyeon Bok) of the Joseon dynasty was destroyed by fire and Japanese invaders going back many centuries (and even as recently as the 1940s during the last WW2). And most, if not all of the buildings were restored since the 1990!sI visited on a lovely warm, sunny October day which was ideal.

A highlight of a trip to Seoul. So beautiful to see locals wearing the traditional hanbuk outfits. The downside? The multitude of selfies taken by tourists!!! Doesn't anyone enjoy sightseeing anymore?!,"October 14, 2018"

This is one of the biggest palace i every been in Seoul. You can hire Hanbok nearby and take pictures about the whole palace.

"Seoul is one of my favorite cities and this palace is a great place to start a Seoul visit. The Palace ticket is 10,000 Won and a great deal. It allows you to visit all 4 palaces which charge entry plus the Joseon tombs and the secret garden tour. This palace is the center of Seoul and considered the most important palace in the Joseon reign. The guided tour is worth taking and then you can go to the nearby folk museum or palace museum. Plan about 2 hours for the palace and 4-6 hours if you combine it with the excellent neighboring museums.","October 14, 2018"
"The location of the palace is accessible by subway and there are lots of helpful signage to reach the area. Take note that the palace is HUGE - so pls wear proper walking shoes and be prepared for some exercise! If you rented a hanbok (traditional Korean clothing) then you would be waived for the entrance fee, but for those who wear the usual clothes, you need to join a long line to queue for entrance fee of KW6000. We arrived just in time for the activity for training palace soldiers on attack and defense, it was quite a show by the soldiers complete with drumbeats and war-cries. After that was the activity for changing of the palace guards, which had a marching band and another set of cultural steps to show the audience. The costumes were lovely and really brought us back to feeling the age of that era!The buildings are really something to admire the intricacy of designs and the entire palace grounds layout is amazing. The flooring is mostly made from uneven stones, so pls ensure you have proper shoes to walk steadily. It makes me wonder how do people from those days run on such ground!","October 13, 2018"

But also expect lots of tourists all the other days. It’s located close to the other palace, in walkable distance but don’t plan both on the same day as I recommend you the guided tour of the Secret Garden which starts at 10.30 am.

"To learn about South Korean history, there is nothing better than this amazing palace. We didn't book a tour but we did it ourselves. Before the visit, we had to document ourselves to learn about this amazing country Every step took us to the hidden gems of this palace. We had a great time. There is a small admission fee. But if you rent the costume, you don't have to pay anything. The costume itself speaks volumes about the Korean traditions, customs and way of life. It's worth the visit.","September 25, 2018"

Excellent place to visit when in Seoul. If you speak English they offer free tours in English 2 or 3 times a day. Check times before going. You do have to admission fee unless you are 65 or older. Tour last about 1 hour. You can spend some additional time on your own.,"September 24, 2018"
"If you want to experience history in modern Seoul, you have to go here. Korean history comes alive while you wander the extensive grounds. My tip is to come here during the Chuseok Holidays","September 29, 2018"

"This is a ""MUST-SEE"" if you ever come to Seoul! I am a huge fan of architecture, and you will find exquisite designs here. The grounds are vast, and you could walk around for hours, which is what I did and loved every meter of it! The history here and what was told to me by my girlfriend was simply incredible! Oddly enough, she had never been and yet lives in Seoul, lol. You must dedicate at least a couple of hours to explore this wonderous place and even go into the museum if you find yourself with some extra time. Also, the gardens are just fantastic!","September 27, 2018"

"I booked a tour including a stop here through Viator. It was great to get to know about the history of the place and also see the changing of the guards at 10 am. It’s a huge area with many buildings. In many ways similar to the Forbidden City in Beijing. Note that there is free access on the last Wednesday of every month. But also expect lots of tourists all the other days. It’s located close to the other palace, in walkable distance but don’t plan both on the same day as I recommend you the guided tour of the Secret Garden which starts at 10.30 am. It is possible to book another time online, though, but I found it fine to take one palace at a time.","September 27, 2018"

Equivalent of 5 Euro for a ticket.There are many areas to walk around and explore within the palace boundaries.All buildings have explanations in English and Korean which was nice to be able to understand.The changing of the guard happens at 2pm and is a must see!

"The Palace was magnificent and the area is quite huge. We rented a Hanbok ( traditional korean attire ) We wore it roaming around and it feels like going back through time. it will also save you from paying for palace entrance and going thru long queing lines going inside. We were also lucky to witness the changing of the palace guards. There was a traditional ceremony, guards were wearing korean warrior outfits. We were also amaze with the structures of the palace and easily appreciated the korean culture. Must see at seoul. ","September 11, 2018"
"I will wrote down my bad experience here, we went here without expecting the place would be that huge, we wore hanbok ( since you'll get free admission) and took pictures inside the area , half an hour later we left, we didn't explore the whole area ) and I just realized that I lost my phone, I ran back to find it but it's gone, I asked the securities and almost no one speaks english ! I found it's very irritating becuase it's one of the first tourist destination and nobody speaks english! the lady in the security guard told me to go back to the first gate which I already went to and they couldn't help me, and they didn't do anything to check if someone found my phone, at the end somebody told me that her nephew found my phone and HAND IT TO THE LOST AND FOUND COUNTER! it irritated me most because that means they didn't even checked the lost and found counter ( that is hiding behind the dessert counter ) . The attarction itself is nice, spare your time becuase it's huge, if you rent hanbok make it at least 2,5 hours so you can wear them around the cultural village as well. But if you need help , embrace yourself since nobody speaks english to help you.","September 10, 2018"
We went here before the Changing of the Guards ceremony and there were a lot of people already. Better to visit wearing a hanbok to truly feel the ambiance of the place and of course for pictorial sessions. :) I would love to visit again!,"September 10, 2018"
"While interesting to explore, not much areas to take cover for a quick respite from the searing heat of summer. Changing of guard ceremony is a sight to watch, but times and length of ceremony depends on the weather. Ticket is good for one entry only. If you come out to watch the changing of guard ceremony from exploring the palace, you will not be allowed to get in again unless you buy a new ticket, so be careful.

The complex has been extensively and lovingly restored following destruction by and expulsion of the Japanese during WWII.

Once it ends, there are women in hanbok who come and open this building. You can choose which costume you want to wear. The building is only open for a very short time (maybe only for 30 minutes?) and you cannot wear the costumes to go into the palace. You don't have to pay anything though, and you can take pictures using the gate and the palace as a backdrop.We were there on a Monday morning to catch the Changing of the Guard ceremony. It was quite a long walk from the Gyeongbokgung subway station (give 10-15 mins allowance). I didn't really understand a lot of what was going on despite the loudspeakers, but the Changing of the Guards looked pretty interesting. You could take pictures with the guards in front of the gate after the ceremony.There are free English tours offered at certain times, but we chose to do a self-tour. We were there for less than two hours, and only chose to check out certain parts after the Changing of the Guard - the Throne Room, the two pavilions, and a bit of wandering around the other parts. You can easily spend a whole morning or afternoon here, considering they also have a free museum inside the palace. A lot of people came dressed in hanbok, and it was admirable to see them as the weather was pretty hot and stifling when we were there end of July!You can catch a glimpse and take a photo of The Blue House coming from within Gyeongbokgung Palace. Keeping the Hyangwonjeong Pavilion walls (the two-story hexagonal pavilion that's currently walled up as of July 2018) on your right, and the Jibok-jae building in front of you, keep walking until you see a gate with guards on your left. (The gate is closest to the Jibok-jae building within the Palace, and is on the north area of the palace complex.) Go out through the gate, and you'll see a larger gate with guards on your right. You can go out to take a photo of The Blue House across the road, but be sure to keep your Gyeongbokgung entrance ticket with you as you re-enter Gyeongbokgung!","September 2, 2018"

"This palace is definitely a step into the past in Seoul. The palace is really big though, you'll probably need at least 3 hours to explore, or even 5 hours! It's really big but it is so beautiful. You can learn about the history of the palace while admiring the beauty of it! ","September 1, 2018"

"I'd highly recommend starting your stay in Seoul at Gyeongbokgung Palace. It's very picturesque and takes you back to another time. Also, it was very interesting seeing the Blue house nearby with all the security guards at the end of my exploration of Gyeongbokgung! Also, it's near Bukchon Hanok Village, which shows a bunch of traditional Korea houses. Prime location to start your exploration!","September 3, 2018"
"one of the beautiful palaces. Huge and probably will take most of your day.The tickets are cheap and if you wear korean dress, then its free entry.Change of guards is good but not as good as Buckingham palace, London","September 3, 2018"
I personally love the garden of the palace. It's a huge palace located at the centre of the city. Even though there were many tourists but it doesn't feel crowded due to huge size of the place. ,"September 3, 2018"

This met at 11.00 hrs inside the second gate on the right. There is a meeting post you can see as you go in. This was very beneficial.Gaurds I am told are actors rather than military.

"Gyeongbokgung used to be the main palace of the Joseon dynasty and out of the different palaces in Seoul, it is definitely larger and grander in scale.The palace is consisted on several areas. The main grounds is where the throne room is situated, with a huge surrounding plaza and gates. This is the most crowded area as many people would want to take photos here and being here makes you feel like you're in a historical drama.There are many smaller areas to explore around the main palace if you're a history buff and if you want a more in depth explanation, do check their website for guided tours.It takes about an hour to three hours to cover the entire area depending on how thorough you want to be and your walking speed, but this place is well worth the visit. While not as mystical as the Changdeokgung Palace, Gyeongbokgung is the palace to visit if you can only visit one palace on Seoul.There are two cafes in the palace grounds as well and visitors need to pay an entrance fee. If you have the time (1-2 days), I strongly suggest getting the Palace Pass at 10,000 won that allows you access to the notable palaces and shrines in Seoul.","August 28, 2018"

The admissions is 3000 Won, but it is free for those who wear hanbok, the Korean traditional costume.

"Visited gorgeous Gyeongbokgung Palace in August 2018 and was wowed by the beauty and size of the complex. First of all, our visit was enhanced through a free guided tour arranged prior to our arrival to Seoul with the City of Seoul Walking Tour. The guide met us near the ticket booth at 10 am, just in time to watch the change of guards ceremony. The guide spoke excellent English and was very knowledgeable about the palace and Korean history. Better yet , there was only one other couple in addition to us. So it was almost like a private guided tour - sure beats the regular tour from the palace. We were also pleasantly surprised that when we asked about senior discount admission tickets, we were asked to show identification documents (and we only had with us Ontario driver’s licenses), the ticket lady gave us free admission tickets. What generosity, even for foreigners!Most of the Gyeongbokgung buildings were beautifully reconstructed and maintained. The complex was one of the best palaces that I have visited in my travels, especially the Heungnyemun Gate 興禮門，the Geunjeogjeon (Throne Hall, 勤政殿), and Gyeonghoeru (Royal Banquet Hall, 慶會楼）with its beautiful pond and gardens. Our guide knew all the intricacies of the various buildings, how they were used, the best angles to take pictures and the different stone sculptures. It was a very interesting tour. We ended the tour at the rear gate of the palace after the emperor’s library and had a view of the current Korean Presidential Blue House. Don’t miss this palace and take advantage of the generosity of the City of Seoul!","August 24, 2018"

"The main and largest royal palace built during the Joseon dynasty, Gyeongbokgung Palace takes you back in time to see how it was like during those days from visiting the on-grounds museums or even trying on a traditional hanbok for photo taking and the experience!

There are signs in several languages (to include English) which explain what each building or object is. There is a museum attached to the grounds which is nice to visit. If you go in the summer, bring a hat and water. There is underground parking but is limited in the number of spots. The cost to enter is reasonable but you will need Korean Won. ","August 13, 2018"

This is a beautiful and peaceful palace of historic significance. Save your taxi money and simply take the subway there - very easy and direct. I would also recommend going as early as possible to avoid the noisy tour groups. The palace opens at 9 am. Bring a parasol if it's summer and drinking water as there is very limited shade available. There are free guided tours available but I recommend either hiring an audio guide or purchasing a guide book for 500 Won - you can then visit at your leisure. A good solid hour of walking the site and returning to the courtyard in front of the palace at 10 am will allow visitors to watch a re-enactment of the changing of the guards. While the process is not exciting - the pageantry and costumes are beautiful!,"August 7, 2018"
"This palace has a very large area which is divided into several parts. The front of the palace as in the palace there are generally guard guards where tourists can take photos and if we are lucky we can witness the procession of replacing the palace guards.The middle part is the king's palace which is not too big but magnificent. Then on the side of the palace there is a very large garden, very beautiful and very suitable for relaxation.

"Gyeongbokgung is a must-see for anyone who is traveling to Korea for its history and traditional culture. The palace grounds are wide and you can see various traditional buildings with traditional art that are perfect for artists and architect enthusiasts. Surrounding the palace are hanbok rental stores where you can rent beautiful hanboks for about 2 hours for about 10,000 won. Considering that a basic hanbok is a few hundred thousand won, it's a great deal for those who just want to wear it for a day. It also gets you free entry into the palace (normal admission is 3,000 won for adults).","August 6, 2018"

Take comfortable shoes, since you will be walking a lot. Make sure to take a hat and water with you as well. It will take at least 2 or 3 hours to check out most of the spots. You will be able to take some lovely photos of the palace and the beautiful settings there. It must have been so quiet and peaceful back then. I have made it to 155 countries.

We were asked whether of foreigners and one 14 yo girl, Veronica offered a guided tour for FREE. Yes, for free. Sure, we took it up right away.We were recommended to visit Gyeongbokgung Palace for various reasons. She took us to every corner of the palace that lasted 2 hours with detailed Korean history in fluent English.Inside you can attend and learn Korean palace tea technique and ceremony. Not far from tea site, a restaurant serving ancient palace meal as well. At 3:30 pm, we were lucky to enjoy Korean classical music with fantastic backdrop as shown in pic.Unfortunately we missed to rent/wear the Korean ancient costumes (only around the palace).

A beautiful peaceful place in the center of the city. I recommend buying the integrated palace ticket as it offers great saving,"June 23, 2018"
"This was a great attraction, and I spent several productive hours here. THe Chosun Dynasty relics were particularly interesting. The ticket prices seemed reasonable and so many of the buildings and annexes were intensely photogenic.","June 23, 2018"
Visited the palace while in S. Korea (Seoul) for my sons wedding. This was a great stop and great lesson in S. Korea’s history.,"June 23, 2018"
"When enter the palace you must buy a ticket except you wear a hanbok. There're single ticket ( ₩3000) or combination ticket for 4 palaces and Jongmyo Shrine (₩10.000). If you aren't sure, buy a single ticket. Gyeongbokgung itself very beautiful. Very clean.","June 22, 2018"
"Great place to know the history of Korea in a day !. Took a metro train to Gyeongbokgung Station exit 5. After a short stroll, we were lucky to bump into a group of teenagers wearing the same orange coloured T shirts, apparently attached to certain organisation, lined up to be noticed and approached. We were asked whether of foreigners and one 14 yo girl, Veronica offered a guided tour for FREE. Yes, for free. Sure, we took it up right away.We were recommended to visit Gyeongbokgung Palace for various reasons. She took us to every corner of the palace that lasted 2 hours with detailed Korean history in fluent English.Inside you can attend and learn Korean palace tea technique and ceremony. Not far from tea site, a restaurant serving ancient palace meal as well. At 3:30 pm, we were lucky to enjoy Korean classical music with fantastic backdrop as shown in pic.Unfortunately we missed to rent/wear the Korean ancient costumes (only around the palace). Do remember the renting place is right inside the main gate. First come first serve basis. Apart from the palace , there are a few great museums within a short walking distance to explore all about the history of Korea.","June 22, 2018"
"Large Palace complex adjacent to government precinct. Beautifully rebuilt and very well maintained. Can self-navigate, and different language brochures available including English. Check tines for opening and changing of guard (a colourful highlight). Plan for 1.5 to 2 hours.","June 22, 2018"
"i am interested in historical place, if you do then you need to go here. They have a hanbok rental around the palace, so you can really walk around using hanbok like you are in joseon dynasty.The place it self is interesting.","June 21, 2018"

We visited all the four palaces & a shrine with the integrated ticket system(for more details check their official website). As far as my personal opinion i didnt enjoy much. My thoughts and expectation where to view the lifestyle of the Korean kings and Queens. In order to experience that we need to see the things they used the same replica of things atleast....but all we saw were just long or small plain halls with not much furnitures or things used by the kings and queens. Most of the halls or rooms were locked and not open for public. This palace was the biggest in area with many halls and grounds. As far as we saw people were just wandering about here and there just like us. May be if we had chosen the guided tour we would have known which place served for which purpose...but then too we dont get to see and imagine ourselves how lives would have been for the Royal family! Its my personal opinion...i dont mean to put down the spirits of visitors who are eager to visit soon or tourists who just get satisfied to set foot into the Royal ground. All 4 palaces were the same.,"June 19, 2018"

Definitely get a guided tour because without it you don't get the historic perspective and greater appreciation of what you are seeing.

It’s pretty relaxed not much to do but actually see the palace so it’s great for learning about the culture pretty sure there are some guided tours I actually just got a ticket and explored was fun and a little confusing there is a museum on site but they were closed when I was there all in all it’s a good place to get a walk about in and see and feel a little history at the same time also some really good photo spots for scrapbookers ,"June 18, 2018"

"This is a great tourist attraction. They make no bones that the palace is not an original and was rebuilt in 1868 after being ruined for 300 years. At 10AM they have a tourist spectacle when they do a changing of the guard ceremony which is very colourful. That takes place in the first courtyard, which is a huge enclosure. From here you proceed to various staterooms, sleeping quarters and then a small garden. The restoration has been nicely done so you can get a feel of how the place used to be. The chimneys are interesting, being outside of the buildings and I think there is one original fireplace and chimney from the 1360's. It was a shame that when we were there the gardens behind the main palace that had a pavillion in the middle of a lake of waterlillies, was actually closed. Admission was 3000 won and there are plenty of bus stops right by the front gate.","June 2, 2018"
"We went to visit the palace just before sunset and it was really stunning to see the palace in the evening light and later on with the lights on.

"This is a great tourist attraction. They make no bones that the palace is not an original and was rebuilt in 1868 after being ruined for 300 years. At 10AM they have a tourist spectacle when they do a changing of the guard ceremony which is very colourful. That takes place in the first courtyard, which is a huge enclosure. From here you proceed to various staterooms, sleeping quarters and then a small garden. The restoration has been nicely done so you can get a feel of how the place used to be. The chimneys are interesting, being outside of the buildings and I think there is one original fireplace and chimney from the 1360's. It was a shame that when we were there the gardens behind the main palace that had a pavillion in the middle of a lake of waterlillies, was actually closed. Admission was 3000 won and there are plenty of bus stops right by the front gate.","June 2, 2018"
"We went to visit the palace just before sunset and it was really stunning to see the palace in the evening light and later on with the lights on. We were extremely lucky to hear and see performances of traditional singing and music that evening. Wonderful palace, really worth a visit when you are in Seoul.","June 1, 2018"
bring a hat or umbrella but its great. with enough facilities for whatever you need. there is even an MRT entrance within the palace ground,"June 1, 2018"
We visited all five of the big palaces in the city and found Gyeongbokgung together with Changdeokgung to be the most impressive ones. While you can't really enter any of the buildings it's worth a visit for the impressive view on the gate alone.,"May 30, 2018"
"One of the biggest palaces in central Seoul and I'm impressed by how well-kept the place is. It feels like you can step back in time and feel what it was like a few hundred years ago. Something you might not know is that you can rent a hanbok (Korean traditional dress) from the nearby areas and enter the palace(s) for free. I got mine from Hanboknam but there are a ton all around the palace. Might as well get it and feel like a part of the era. Little things like the changing of guard ceremony also help in helping visitors appreciated what it was like in the past.I would have appreciated if there were picture signage to help me identify where I was within the palace. That said it would have broke into the whole authenticity of the space. Overall it's a beautiful timepiece symbolic of an older Korea. Worth 1-2 hours of just visiting and wandering around, more if you're wearing a hanbok and taking pictures.","May 29, 2018"
This palace is really nice to see even knowing that it's all reconstructed. The this is that you need to take your time to go around because it takes at least 2-3 hours to go around and see everything. The library at the end is also very nice. ,"May 29, 2018"

It’s beautiful lovely place so many thing to see and amazing garden and you can see a blue house where is the Korean President live !! Very clean good place to visit and relax !! You can shop and have coffee shop too !! You can walk or take MRT or bus if you stay in the center of city ! I do love Seoul very much will come back next week June 5 ,"May 29, 2018"
"With just 3000 entry fee, this place was worth the visit. It is huge and I would recommend visiting during 4 in the evening when the sun is not harsh and it closed by 6 PM, so 2 hours would be a good time here. I recently heard about the night tour, if they have it - go for it.Gardens, palaces and museums - a long walk but a good experience.","May 29, 2018"

"Main palace of the Joseon Dynasty and built in the 14th Century. The palace grounds are vast and the national museum for palaces is situated in its grounds near Heungnyemun Gate (main gate). The entrance fee is quite cheap only 3000 won or free if you arrive wearing traditional Korean clothing such as a Hanbok. This activity is definitely something you should do when it is a dry day and it is near other sites like Samcheong park, Changgyeonggung palace and Deoksugung park. Plenty of other places, street food, restaurants in and around the area so you can make a big day of it. We made a big day of it visiting both palaces, once in traditional hanbok and once not and we got some great food including Gyeranbbang (egg bread) and chicken ginseng and looking around the local shops and markets.","May 23, 2018"

"To visit a country so proud of its cultural heritage is pleasant. So much time has been taken to not only rebuild a nation so recently devastated by war, but to rebuild a historical journey of a country that has been in the middle of conflict since ancient times. Gyeongbokgung was the primary Palace and stronghold of the King and when you see it you will understand why. The skill to build such a place without the technology of today is breathe taking. Don't just look at the walls and the buildings, take the time to look at how they were constructed and how they fit in with the other palaces, shrines and protective walls that were built to repel invasions. When you sit and take in the sheer expanse of these sites and the amount of people it took to make them run it is mind blowing. To see early ducted underground heating in these ancient sites is stunning. Sit in the gardens, take photos and enjoy everything the site has to offer. ","May 22, 2018"

"As everybody says in the review, you can't leave Seoul without visiting this place. It is always busy everyday throughout the year, but it'll worth it. I visited during a weekday, and there were lots of students ranged from elementary school to college, that were on their study tour. Some of them wears beautiful hanbok because admission is free if you wear hanbok. In fact, it's just like going to Disneyland without Mickey's ears, so be sure to rent one, there are lots of hanbok rentals around. Some of the students will ask you for a photo though, it's their assignment from the school. It's quite fun, but probably a little annoying if you don't like talking to strangers.","May 21, 2018"

You could easily spend a whole day just walking around and taking in the different areas, however I would recommend setting aside two hours for a good feel of the place. It is definitely worth paying the low fee of the entrance ticket to fully enjoy the grounds and not just the entrance area.What really adds to the historic feeling is the many beautiful dresses worn by Koreans. Shops in the area will rent out historic costumes and many Korean girls and couples can be seen taking photos within the palace grounds. It's a beautiful sight that's worth seeing. If you're daring, perhaps rent out a costume yourself for a nice photo-shoot? The grounds definitely have loads of opportunities for lovely pictures than cannot be taken anywhere else.","May 21, 2018"

"My girlfriends and I visited the palace dressed in Hanbok, the traditional Korean dress, on a Sunday morning. The Hanbok rental place (3355 Hanbok rental) is conveniently located approx. 5 minutes walk away from the palace. The first thing we noticed when we arrived was the huge crowd outside of the visitors' entrance. The reason for this soon became clear- the changing of the guards' ceremony was taking place. This is when the palace guards (all dressed in their traditional guard attires) would 'change shifts' and it is a must see as the ceremony is quite elaborate and goes on for about 30 minutes or so.The next thing we noticed is the crowd in general. If you wear a Hanbok to visit the palace, entry will be free (please do confirm for yourself there as this might change). Thus, there were a lot of people, both foreign and local, dressed up in the Hanbok visiting the palace. And it was of course, a weekend. I'd advise you plan your visit for sometime during the week if possible.Insofar as the palace itself is concerned, it is well-preserved and definitely worth visiting as it is a piece of Korean history- both in terms of culture and architecture.","May 13, 2018"
This palace is to be visited when in Seoul and the best part of the day was seeing the people. When I went there was a festival of Korean Culture where people dressed up in traditional clothing and wandered the site. To be honest I’ve visited too many of these temples of late but it is impressive and if you can go at night (which I did not - I saw a friends pictures) it is more impressive. There are stores nearby that rent the traditional clothing so if you are interested you too can look like you fit in. ,"May 13, 2018"
Love the palace and the vibe ! All girls and boys dressed up in Hanbok traditional clothes and as colorful and royal as it looks. ,"May 12, 2018"
"Bought a good deal from kkday for Php 899/person for a 6hr rental of hanbok. The location of the hanbok studio is strategical since it’s in front of the gate of this palace. Wearing traditional dress like hanbok will free yourself from paying entrances for most of the palaces. I believe Changdeokgung palace is the only palace that’s asking for an entrance fee even if you’re are wearing hanbok, as I’ve heard this is the most beautiful and instagrammable of all. We did not able to visit all palaces on the same day because of the limited time. We thought 6hrs is enough to explore those, but I was wrong, since palaces are far from each other. Gyeongbokgung is a huge palace and most of the time it’s crowded, but we did enjoy the sight seeings, go ahead and take a picture with the doors and walls, it’s instagrammable. The comfort is very far so I suggest you take one map from the tourist information, if you plan to wear hanbok, (Irecommend that for a full experience) I suggest you rent a 24hr and do it very early so that you can explore all the palaces. All the palace close at 6pm. But you can opt to rent for hours more cheaper then take a cab going to other palaces too. This the way going there: Take a subway going gyeongbokgung station and exit 3-1 there’s many hanbok rental on that exit. But if you don’t like wearing one just go straight up to the other side of entrance. Please download Seoul subway map. ","May 11, 2018"

"This palace is worth visiting if you are in Seoul. Will need to pay an entrance fee but the place is big enough for a couple of hours of touring.

We went during this year's cherry blossom season (April 11, 2018) when cherry blossom trees were in full bloom, which made the palace grounds even more picturesque. Rent a traditional Korean outfit (Hanbok) and admission to the palace grounds is free.

There is quite a bit of greenery and foilage unlike the Forbidden City. While it is impossible to not compare the two, the Seoul Palace stands on its own as a place of magnificance and wonder.

I liked the smaller details of the walls, buildings, statues, and the few items around ie cauldrons. In some places, the grounds were empty space where buildings used to be, but there were other surprises around every corner.

"One your trip to Seoul you have to visit one of the palaces. This one is the biggest. I’d describe it more like a compound . In that it has many buildings and courtyards within the outside walls. The cost is just a few dollars to enter the main gate. You will likely see folks dressed in traditional Korean attire waking around taking pictures etc. it’s popular to do, and encouraged in that they get in free if they are dressed accordingly. We saw at least two wedding parties taking photos there. There are English translations on most displays. I believe you can rent audio guides if you want. The palace grounds are large, with ponds and courtyards. It’s a very night stroll around to check it all out.","April 25, 2018"

"This is a nice looking palace with large grounds.The experience is heightened by dressing in the colourful traditional Korean clothes called hanbok. You get free entry to the palace grounds if you wear a hanbok and you won't be out of place as there are many others wearing hanbok as well. We were able to get men and women hanbok for 5000 won each for 2 hours, at ABC Hanbok Rental which is located on the second floor of a building across the road from the palace on the Geonchunmun Gate side.Changing of guard ceremonies at 1pm and 2pm were worth watching, as well as guard training at 1:35pm. A 'Mexican wave' of swords drill was particularly impressive! There are free guided tours as well. There was an English speaking guided tour at 1:30pm, which seemed quite popular. We didn't go to that as the timing clashed with the guard training session.A good place to get a photo is the banquet hall to the left side surrounded by water and mountain in the background.","April 25, 2018"
Gyeongbokgung palace is very impressiveIt is a large place and in the open It tells us about the culture the history and how people lived in that era. It has a lovely walkway enveloped with lovely cherry blossom trees and benches to rest on. A lovely place to capture photographs. It has a small cafe to unwind. Entry is free if one wears the traditional clothes which can be hired in a nearby place. It was wonderful to see so many youngsters wearing their Grady costumes with lovely hairstyles and wearing gorgeous accessories. We took many pictures with them and wished we had also hired those traditional clothes I highly recommend a visit to the Gyeongjokjung Palace,"April 25, 2018"

Also, if you are looking for a reduction in crowds, get there just before the changing of the guard (everyone is watching them, so you have more photo opportunities without the crowds).

You can peek in from open windows and see over the wall at times from around the grounds however.Located in downtown Seoul, you can see this palace in a couple hours and right next door on the way out is the Nation Folk Museum.

"While mechanical problems in Seattle caused us to miss our connection to India, the 24 hour delay awaiting our next connection opportunity gave us an awesome chance to see some of Korea. The first stop on our free layover tour provided by Incheon Airport was Gyeongbokgung Palace. Steeped in history, and quite well preserved, the Palace grounds we found were quite large, and filled with palace structures and artifacts. The interiors of the palace were quite well preserved, awash in colored interior spaces, and the palace was teaming in costumed Korean soldiers of around 16th century Korea. The changing of the guard ceremony happens in the afternoon, and it's quite a flamboyant spectacle with many costumed participants. The ceremony lasts around a half an hour, and is well worth a pic or two. To add to the historical flavor, many locals come in costume to the Palace, and parade around the grounds. I had heard many weddings also take place at the Palace, however, that was just traveler talk, nothing from anyone official.Self guiding audio tours with earbuds are available in many languages at the entry, and there seemed to be an ample supply.

a great place to visit. would recommend planning your visit ahead of time as the palace is not open every day (closed on Tuesdays i thInk). There are set times for changing of the guards so again check out the times if you want to see this,"April 13, 2018"
"Visited 20 yrs ago. A v quite palace but now a bit crowded. Visitors wearing traditional Korea costume, taking fotos everywhere, esp under the cherry tree. A bit annoying","April 13, 2018"
"Only gave it a passing review - because I did this without a tour, and it was really boring :X. The compound is huge, u can't step into the building but look at it from outside only. There's tons of tourists wearing hanbok which I feel it is one of the must-do experience. As u venture into the further parts, there are less and lesser tourists but the same building and mini gardens, sigh - tour guide is a must.Don't miss the guard changing routing like I did :( there's 2 rounds of it in a day check out the timing. ","April 13, 2018"
"Nice to see a palace from Joseon Dynasty, I watched Korean drama and Joseon Era is always shown. Nothing much to see inside, the fee was $3; some people dressed up in hanbok dresses and walked around the palace and take pictures. The change of guards was great to see, they do it every half hour.","April 12, 2018"
"The Palace is beautiful. Our tour guide, with quite a sense of humor, did a great job explaining the history and present-day status of the palace. There as a medium-sized crowd overall, and good thing we had our jackets! It was cold!! The palace is worth visiting! Truly iconic! If you have limited time, be sure to add this to your tour list! Lots of nearby restaurants too. The mountain scenery is breathtaking! ","April 12, 2018"
"Try to get to the palace for the 10am guard changing. Seeing all the tourists in traditional costume is hilarious, and like nothing I’ve seen anywhere in the world. Sadly, the palace is mostly a replication of the 14thc original, which burned down and was sacked by conquerers, but still a worthy visit. ","April 12, 2018"
This was the first palace I went to and I'm not sure if I find it that amazing... Probably if I have more time to go around and explore the entire compound. There were many tourists around that was probably why I did not enjoy it that much. It's great for experience purposes if you want to get exposed to Korean culture. There are a lot of things to do outside as well so you need not worry where to eat and stuff. It's also near other famous palaces and Insadong.,"April 12, 2018"
"The largest and oldest palace in Seoul, which is one in five of the palaces.This place combines historical stories,beautiful architecture and nature. I love here. Recommend to visit.","April 11, 2018"
"This palace is very large and grand. It was nice catching the performance of the changing of guards. If you missed the performance here, you can catch another one at Deoksugong. Our Chinese guide for the free tour impressed us with her good language skills and extensive knowledge. We learnt a lot about the Korean history and culture. The visit will not be half as good without the guide, it would just be buildings of which we would know little about. To take the tour, wait at the appointed time at the black stand just after the entrance. Highlights were the building in which Korean language Hanggul was invented by King Sejong (although original is no longer there), pavilion with rows of cherry blossoms in front of lake, hidden dragons at the main shrine hall, the decorated main chimney chute for emissions from ten rooms. Other than that the rest are similar to the other palaces. Each palace has a different history and usage, we visited each one in the combined pass each time taking the guided tour and it was still interesting. Don’t miss out the Korean folk museum and the north village which have free admission and are connected to the palace.","April 10, 2018"

Very simple to find and walking distance to some hotels, other tourist area and main attraction. ","April 9, 2018"
"This was a very nice visit, I went for the tour which had a lot of rich information about the culture, architecture and so on.

On the palace ground is also the National Palace Museum of Korea which housed a good collection of the emperor's personal belongings, the cars, clothes, and items used in the daily living.

Be ready to have lots of girls dressed up in Korean traditional dresses spending ages in different parts of the palace taking pictures. They are an absolute nightmare.

"We went on a free Seoul airport tour to see this palace and did not get to see everything. It is a massive place where one should set aside a few hours to explore. We also went in the winter, when it was cold. I imagine in the summer it's a lot better. With that said, I really enjoyed walking and taking pictures of the various buildings. There wasn't too many places to go inside, but one could look into some of the main buildings, such as the throne room of the king.

"The Gyeongbokgung Palace was the main royal palace of the Joseon dynasty and was definitely a must-visit on our Seoul bucket list.. Built in 1395, it is located in northern part of Seoul and with that said, it was a rather gobsmacking experience to observe how much Seoul has modernised over the years just by standing at the entrance of the palace. The colours, design and interior of the palace was remarkable and well-preserved over the years. I visited the place at 1pm, just in time for their change-of-guard ceremony which lasted for about 10 minutes. It was an interesting performance to witness and thank goodness for perfect timing. Expect a lot of tourists dressed up in hanboks (traditional Korean garments) lining up to take a photo with the palace guards or posing everywhere along the palace grounds (and I mean it, EVERY WHERE). I visited the palace on a Tuesday (mind you it was a non-holiday season) and it was packed. I can't imagine what it would be like on a weekend!There are free tours of the palace grounds in English but I did not follow the crowd as I started getting annoyed at the number of tourists mindlessly carrying their selfie sticks and swinging them around everywhere. It was just me though, I dislike crowded places and flocks of tourists. Worth a visit, nevertheless!","April 1, 2018"

"Right, before you visit this place be sure to rent a Hanbok outfit! It really does make the whole experience worthwhile. You get to pick your outfit and walk the palaces amongst tourists and locals also doing the same. Admission to the palaces is free if you're wearing the Hanbok outfits :DIts really scenic and quiet and its rather beautiful. However we couldn't find much information on the buildings themselves so I'd recommend a guided tour if you're really interested. We could only explore for an hour as we only rented the Hanbok for an hour but you could easily spend a couple of hours here.","March 28, 2018"
"We got there a bit late, couldn’t go through the gate anymore. But it was probably better to watch it at the front of the palace, later they let us in, we still saw the band, the marching columns, Colorful/ beautiful costumes . It lasted about an half hour. In the end we got to take pictures with generals and soldiers . Was fun.","March 27, 2018"

"I walked the whole palace. I was giving high hope to review the history and how the emperor or ancient Korean lived. However, it seems like no one comment this is a REBUILD of everything!!!! You can still be amazing by the size and the building structure. However, beside the main palace all other places are empty..... A bit disappointed because I like to understand the Korean culture more. Still you can see the Korean government's effort to rebuild the palace and allow tourists understand their past.","March 26, 2018"
"It’s a very scenic palace and it’s a must go place for tourist whom visit Seoul. But unfortunately for us that coming to Seoul on Seollal Day, the palace closed early than it supposed to so it is very disappointing as we are unable to go in even though it still early. It stated that the palace closed at 4.30pm due to the Public Holiday as we already reached there at 4.20pm, they are not allowing us to get in. So it is really saddening me cause it is my dream place to visit. What we can only do is taking a picture outside the palace. ","March 26, 2018"
The palace is an interesting area to visit. Plenty of information to learn about how the king and queen lived before capitalism ruled over. The ritual of changing of guards at 10am Seoul time in the vicinity of the palace is not to be missed. ,"March 25, 2018"
"I paid a visit with my couple just a few days before she went back to her Homeland, and we had an amazing time.First of all, ""Nightseeing"". During summer, they also open during night time, and usually foreigners had special price (which is more expensive) in any country; in the palace, foreigners have an opportunity to get a different personal daily quota (Some Koreans may not have a place... but we got it).Moreover, they held presentations, special lighting and a very unique opportunity to see Seoul and Korea's history in a whole different way.","March 25, 2018"
This is probably the main palace most tour guides and groups take tourists to. That being said it is crowded if you go at the wrong time. Admission is free if you wear a hanbok(korean traditional wear). Once you stray a bit from the main entrance it does quiet down but be prepared for crowds on days with nice weather. There are sometimes protests going on in the surrounding area outside the main gates. ,"March 25, 2018"
Nice view of the palaces and picturesque place to go around. Enjoyed my sightseeing! Some areas are under restoration and renovations. Place is quite huge but feast for the eyes!,"March 28, 2018"
"I had been to Seoul many times, but never able to visit Gyeongbokgung Palace. Glad I did this last trip. They have free guided tours in English which last and hour which was helpful in learning more about the palace and grounds. The changing of the guard ceremony happens at 10 and 2.","March 28, 2018"
"Right, before you visit this place be sure to rent a Hanbok outfit! It really does make the whole experience worthwhile. You get to pick your outfit and walk the palaces amongst tourists and locals also doing the same. Admission to the palaces is free if you're wearing the Hanbok outfits :DIts really scenic and quiet and its rather beautiful. However we couldn't find much information on the buildings themselves so I'd recommend a guided tour if you're really interested. We could only explore for an hour as we only rented the Hanbok for an hour but you could easily spend a couple of hours here.","March 28, 2018"
"We got there a bit late, couldn’t go through the gate anymore. But it was probably better to watch it at the front of the palace, later they let us in, we still saw the band, the marching columns, Colorful/ beautiful costumes . It lasted about an half hour. In the end we got to take pictures with generals and soldiers . Was fun.","March 27, 2018"
"This was our first place to visit after our breakfast at the hotel.It was winter that time but the sun is out .The place was huge and while we were walking,our guide was telling us the story of the Palace.I recommend to visit this place first hour during your visit in seoul because you can no longer take the pictures you like if there are many people already.","March 27, 2018"
"I walked the whole palace. I was giving high hope to review the history and how the emperor or ancient Korean lived. However, it seems like no one comment this is a REBUILD of everything!!!! You can still be amazing by the size and the building structure. However, beside the main palace all other places are empty.....

"Seeing Gyeongbokgung Palace is on the A list for tours, but beyond the history and the culture, the thing that I enjoyed most was watching Koreans take pictures in their traditional clothing, Hanbok. This is a serious activity for Koreans, especially for the young in love, engaged or recently married. There are ""required"" photo ops and it was fun watching the ""romantics"" cue up for traditional photo spots. I offered to take photos for several groups so that everyone could get into the picture and they allowed me to take their picture as well. Some even invited me to pose with them and shot a picture for me on my camera! Note: If you wear a hanbok, then admittance is free to the Palace. Over 65 are also free. I also shot pictures of all the Haechi statues at the palace. The Haechi (a picture of which is on almost every Seoul taxi) is a mythical lion-like horned creature that often appears in myths as a guardian against fire and disasters. A large Haechi statue stands on guard in front of Gyeongbokgung Palace, protecting the nation. Also, there is a nice place to have a tea or other beverage and small pastry.","March 24, 2018"
"The place is very BIG and clean, but historical naration to the tourist is not sufficient. Only some area has a naration.","March 24, 2018"
"It was worth paying that 3000w we paid for each person. We had a long walk, good thing we went towards the end of winter so walking was not a problem since the weather was very good!!! Its nuce too that ladies wear the hanbok and the setting was perfect. Beautiful sceneries and architecture","March 24, 2018"
Visiting this palace makes you feel you're in a Korean historical drama while wearing Hanbok which is free entrance when you wear it. The place is very big and many spot for instagram photos. One of the best is the lake view.,"March 24, 2018"
We had fun inside the palace. We rented Korean costume and had lots of fun photos. The best one in the one in the lake. It was postcard quality photos. Highly recommend to come and visit this place when you are in Korea. ,"March 23, 2018"
"I have been to Gyeongbokgung Palace for more than 5 times and all are different season. Those most I like is during Autumn. The lake is so beautiful. Many people visited this palace dressing Hanbok, its make the place looks like very historical. I love the architecture of the palace. Its so classic and beautiful. The information about the palace is very clear. The ambience is so nice and relaxing.","March 23, 2018"
Architecture was great and we arrived just in time for the changing of guard ceremony. Good place to visit.,"March 22, 2018"
This palace reminded me so much of the Forbidden City of Beijing except Gyeongbokgung had way more signs explaining the historical context. It's definitely worth a visit!,"March 22, 2018"
"It is hard to be impress by the palace if you have been to China. Those are bigger, more grand and more historically significant than the ones in Seoul. There is a lot of empty spaces with just sands and normal trees. Very little historical information are given and the whole place just feel souless. Better off to visit the national museum nearby. You can also see many people dressed in Korean hanbok but I find it gimmicky, you do received free entrance if you do that as well. It is one of those places you go so you can said I been there.","March 22, 2018"

Not that it’s expensive otherwise - I think it’s about 2 or 3 US dollars. I wasn’t there in time for the free tours and I feel I would have loved it even more if I had taken one; for someone who knows very little about Seoul or even Korea, most of the context is lost.

Some reviewers complain there isn't much to see here. But I guess it depends upon what your goals are.Yes, the buildings are mostly closed or empty. But the way the palace is built with exposure to weather with unheated buildings, it is understandable why they won't be full of ancient artifacts. You'll find those in museums nearby. I have been here probably five times going back over 30 years, and I never cease to find it a place to calmly reflect on Korea's ancient and interesting history as a keystone located in the heart of East Asia.

I visited this palace today. Wow - how boring can a palace be! This one takes the biscuit!! Lots of Koreans all garbed up in traditional Korean dress which they hire locally - even men so they get free admission. Selfies are the order of the day. We maybe just a bit of glamour. Let's get down to hard facts. Lots of buildings - most closed with nothing to see. Those open / nothing inside - again empty rooms - nothing to see. Exceptions: the throne room has a throne in - basic and the Gyeonghoeru Pavilion is of national significance for its important part in architectural design and application. This is not a place to visit even if it only costs 4000 won. The National Palace Museum of Korea is in the same compound (admission free) is excellent.

This is not a place to visit even if it only costs 4000 won. The National Palace Museum of Korea is in the same compound (admission free) is excellent. So head there when disillusionment overcomes you from your Palace experience.,"March 8, 2018"
"We had a day in Seoul. This large Palace and all the historical information was enough to keep us busy for the the day. We watched the changing of guard, saw lots the architecture, and experience and learnt some of the South Korea’s culture .","March 7, 2018"
one of the palaces in the middle of the seoul. Near to gwanghwamun square and choenggyechon stream. the most visited palace among others.,"March 7, 2018"
Visited this palace in end Feb and a huge part of the palace is under renovation. Will not recommend visiting until renovations are over ,"March 7, 2018"
The scenery was fantastic because of the snow that came down a few days ago. Was very impressive.,"March 6, 2018"
"Gorgeous buildings and grounds facing downtown Seoul. Temples, pavilions, shrines, and ponds. Plan at least a couple of hours","March 6, 2018"
"Had a great afternoon there, would recommend it on a sunny day for nice photos. Do rent the hanbok for a perfect photo and check out the restaurants nearby.","March 6, 2018"
"My mom loves korean movies. Specially old historical movies. It felt i was walking in one of their scenes. Interesting palace. I wish i was there in spring time, i am sure with all the trees and flowers would have looked marvelous","March 5, 2018"
"Even if you spend only a few minutes here, Gyeongbokgung Palace is a beautiful and important part of Korean history. The main palace is a stunning example of Korean architecture and it is a great place to sightsee with all the visitors in traditional Korean dress. ","March 5, 2018"
"Spent the afternoon at Gyeongbokgung Palace, the National Palace of Korea. We were totally amused watching the guard's antics before and after we entered! It is a huge site with many areas under restoration. The grounds were beautiful and an array of stunning autumn colours set the scene. Many young women/men (and older) in full traditional dress, it was so special to see. A huge site, it was also home to the Korean Fok Museum and Korean Nationa Palace Museum. We spent an afternoon here, but if you want to visit the Museums it could almost be a full day visit.At one gate we were able to go out and see The Blue House which is the executive office and official residence of the South Korean head of state, the President of the Republic of Korea.","March 4, 2018"
"Walking distance from our hotel, we visited the palace in the morning where there is not much people yet around. Good for taking photos and nice to see Korean architecture. You have to see the changing of guards that takes place at certain hours of the day. You can also rent traditional Korean attire at a few places around the palace to capture awesome memorable pictures.","March 4, 2018"
We visited the site during the New Year weekend so it was full of visitors wearing their own or rented Hanbok traditional clothing. The atmosphere was very festive with people all dressed up sitting on the steps of the various structures taking photographs. Be sure to look up and enjoy the painted colors of the buildings. There is a brief changing of the guard with drums and flags and guards in colorful period uniforms. The adjacent museum had an english audio guide to assist you through the exhibits,"March 4, 2018"
Excellent for tourist who wants to experience the history and culture of korea. I recommend it for nature-loving and people who don't mind walking and listening to lectures. there is a guided tour that are very informative and the place is relaxing.,"March 4, 2018"
"My friend and I rushed to Gyeongbokgung Palace to witness the Changing of Guard Ceremony, we were awed with performance despite of the cold weather. Afterwards, we rushed to the nearby store to rent a hanbok-traditional Korean dress. It was a bit expensive but it was worth it. If you visit this place wearing a hanbok, entrance fee is waived. The palace is a beauty to behold. This is the biggest palace among the 5 palaces of Seoul, South Korea. This is the living witness of the history of Korea. The palace offers breathtaking views, perfect for pictorial. If you are a heritage lover, then this place is a must see. Aside from the palace itself, you can witness the changing of guard ceremony observed every morning and visit the National Palace Museum and National Folk Museum within the compound for free. It was lovely experience, it was a dream come true!!","March 4, 2018"
Great place to spend and hour or so looking around. Very beautiful in every season even in the rain. Highly recommend spending a day looking at all the palaces in Seoul!,"March 4, 2018"
Best palace in Seoul. Really beautiful. The entrance is 3000w. Worth the visit and there are no queues.,"March 4, 2018"
I recommend taking the combo tickets and doing all the palaces in 1 or 2 days it is worth the 10.000 won. Gyeongbukgung is the biggest palace and the most impressive one ^^ enjoy the history of thr joseon dynasty and the museum next to it :) but the palace Doeksugung that l lesser known and down from gyeongbukgung is worth a visit after sundown !!! Only palace that is open and lighted up at night ^^ it is impressive and so pretty !,"March 4, 2018"
"My sister and I visited Gyeongbokgung, once without a hanbok (entrance fee is 3000krw/person if I'm not mistaken) and again with hanbok (free entry) for the fun of it. Visitors are not allowed to enter any of the buildings which are empty, however are free to walk everywhere. Everything is outdoor... The weather was pretty cold when we were there. The cafe and gift shop was our temporary hideout for snacks and hot tea. There are free English tours available at certain times during the day. We did not join the tour due to the cold weather. The guards change ceremony is also interesting to watch. This was one of the busiest palace we visited during our trip. We spent about 2-3 hours here. ","March 4, 2018"

The National Palace Museum and the National Folk Museum are nearby just outside of the respective gates. Well worth a visit, if one has to understand the history of Korea.","March 4, 2018"
"The palace is set against the impressive backdrop of Bugaksan Mountain and the grounds offer a great insight into the power and majesty of the Joseon royal court, the most long-lasting dynasty in Korean history. There are English brochures at the ticket stand to aid foreign visitors. I believe there are also guided tours, but we chose the self-guided option and used our brochures to walk the grounds and explore the sprawling compound. Also on-site and free to enter: the Korean National Folk Museum and Korean National Palace Museum.","March 4, 2018"
"It was zero degrees celsius when we visited but we just had to dress up in hanbok. I think doing so made it more special. It was unbelievably cold but it still fun. I opted not to get dressed in kimono when I visited Japan, this experience makes me want to go back and try the kimono.","March 3, 2018"
"The Royal Palace is a must-see attraction if you want to appreciate the life style in the old Korean kingdom. The actual palace is rather large, with a lot of empty spaces. The actual living quarter for the residences are very small. There are simple buildings with several rooms and courtyards. In comparison, I found this Palace more formal than the Japanese. The design is similar the one in Beijing; but in a much much smaller scale.","March 3, 2018"
This place is really huge and I was amazed by the structures being preserved up to this time. Witness the changing of guards and a lot at least 1-2hrs when visiting. This is a must visit place in Seoul!! This is totally worth it. ,"March 3, 2018"
"I absolutely recommend you to join the free guided groups (every 1-2 h). As well, I went in a morning of a workday, so no pretty crowded. You can also buy Palace Pass (10 000 W) for 4 palaces, which makes sense as the ticket here is 3 000 W for all (no student discount). My advice: eat well before going, no shops on the territory, and take comfortable shoes and warm clothes as you will be walking 2-3 hours.","March 3, 2018"
Wonderful palace showcasing the beauty of simplicity of Korean royal architecture. Visit early in the morning before it gets too crowded. Change of guards at 10am and 2pm worth to watch. Lose yourself among the various pavilions and do not miss the wooden palace at the top north of the estate. ,"March 3, 2018"

"While it’s sort of pretty with what there is, the palace grounds are really small and doesn’t really have much grandiosity to it. If compared to the forbidden palace, it pales greatly in comparison. Most (if not all) of the palace is reconstructed from a fire before being abandoned for a few centuries, so it doesn’t look or feel how an ancient structure would typically be. At the end of the palace, beyond it, there are some weird prison like structures that absolutely destroys the beauty of the mountain as a backdrop to the palace. Entry fee isn’t expensive though, at US$3, so it’s worth a visit if you’re exploring the area. Not really worth a detour.","March 1, 2018"

"We visited the Gyeongbokgung Palace while we were in South Korea for the Olympics. It allowed us to soak in the long standing history of the country in a very modern and busy downtown city like Seoul. First thing we noticed without much research into the palace was the size and scope of the area. We initially entered the palace thinking it would be a good hour of exploration, but if you want to take in everything the site has to offer that would likely require 4-6 hours. By the time we left, I clocked about 3.5 miles of walking. The buildings are magnificent. Most are recently built because they have been destroyed so many times over the past 800 years so you won’t be looking at historic monuments per se, but you get the grand scope of the palace as you venture around. We happened to visit right at the end of the four day Korean National holiday so there were a lot of South Koreans taking very traditional pictures with the cultural clothing rented from local shops. We found that extremely interesting and actually allowed us some great pictures of the palace buildings with amazingly garbed locals. The one thing that I would say is definitely take your pictures, but at a certain point the buildings look very similar and the photographs kind of meld together. Therefore don’t be afraid to put the phone/camera down and just experience the history in front of you. The buildings will look too similar in pictures but you will still be in awe of the surroundings that only your eyes will be able to soak in. The winter is very cold and the plant life is all in hibernation. I would love to see what the palace looks like in the spring in full bloom but all in all it was a great visit. ","February 26, 2018"
"It was a very interesting experience We enjoyed watching the changing of the guard and hearing the history if the palace. We chose to rent Korean dress and walk around which wass fun. I would encourage this as many people chose to take their pictures with us. It is amazing how large this palace is.

Its free entry inside the palace if you wear the traditional hanbok. Otherwise changing of guards and walking around the palace is free too. Lots of photogenic places. Hanbok rentals are mostly at bukchan hanok area across the street and up. Loads of variety of price and time limit. So ask first before purchasing.

Hanbok rentals are mostly at bukchan hanok area across the street and up. Loads of variety of price and time limit. So ask first before purchasing. Trustworthy enough to keep your coats with them remember to bring along your wallet and phone and camera on a handbag rented by them. ,"February 21, 2018"
"We were visiting 2018 Olympic Games and stopped fro few days in Seoul. Visiting Gyeongbokgung Palace was highlight of our visit, watching changes of guards, visiting different parts of palace was awesome. Korean history is reach, interesting and memorable.","February 21, 2018"
Really enjoyed the walk in the palace ground with my sons. As a fan of Korean movies n dramas it feel surreal to walk around this beautiful place.,"February 21, 2018"
"Well preserved. Full of history. They even offer free tours (chinese, english, korean etc) inside the palace. The people wearing hanbok makes the palace alive.","February 20, 2018"
To enhance your Korea experience.It is recommended to wear their traditional costume they call Hanbok. It’s amazing to stroll around this well preserve palace. Last time June 2017 the pavilion was renovated but the rest of the area is still accessible.,"February 19, 2018"
Me and my friends rented a hanbok so we can enter for free also the scenery feels like you're in a different world like those you watch in korean dramas its really an amazing experience .,"February 18, 2018"
Lovely area with very reasonable price entrance prices' easy to navigate even for persons that have difficulties to walk' the photo ops all around are unique nor too be missed' and the place is able to maintain its beauty even with thousands of tourist inside its ground because of its sheer size' ,"February 18, 2018"
"You can dress up in hanbok (especially the costumes for king / queen, etc). Lot of photo opp, but not really much to look at. Vast space and not really much inside. It's interesting how international Korea has become.. lots of tourists from all over.","February 18, 2018"
"It's also called The Northern Palace or The Royal Palace and it's the biggest of the five palaces in Seoul. In summer, it is open from 9 a.m. until 6:30 p.m. and closes on Tuesdays. You will need at least half a day to see it completely and good walking shoes which you can take off easily. I strongly recommend checking the official website in English and buying an Integrated Ticket that will allow you to save some money and to visit four palaces and a shrine. The ticket is worth 10,000 won. You can book it online and pay for it when you go into one of the palaces. In order to get there, the best way is to go to Gyeongbokgung Station (Seoul Subway Line 3) and Exit 5 or go to Anguk Station (Seoul Subway Line 3) and Exit 1. You can also take buses No. 1020, 7025,109, 171, 172, 601 or 606 and get off at Gyeongbokgung Palace Bus StopIf you want to visit this palace with a tour, there are three tours in English every day. We decided to do it on our own at our own pace but we went on tours in other palaces and the guides are usually great and very professional.The most beautiful part was a temple in the middle of a lake.You can see the pictures on my blog.You will see people dressed in beautiful traditional Korean clothes called Hanbok. We mainly saw young groups of friends and couples. All five palaces waive admission fees for visitors wearing hanbok and there are shops that rent them. Mind you, we never saw a foreigner wearing a Hanbok.There was a small café in the palace and we had to sit there to have a drink and eat something because we were exhausted.All in all, this palace is a must and no matter how tired you end up it's totally worth it.","February 18, 2018"
"This place is one of the many reasons why many people visit Seoul. The old architectural surrounded by the most technology building makes most unique combinations. It makes you almost feel the revolutionary. The palace itself contains many historical secret which we can only guess through the presence. Not to mention the “rental hanbok” nearby which you can turn yourself into a historical as well. People visit here all year round, even in the winter. Don’t worry about the subway line, it’s everywhere and it’s pretty easy to get there cheaply. It’s 2 in 1 because there’s also a museum. Very recommend!","February 18, 2018"
"You can reach this palace by using the subway train, the Gyeongbokgung station. Once you arrived, it is recommended to rent a Hanbok dress, because your picture will look more classic. Haha. You can walk about 300 meters to the left of this palace entrance to go to the Hanbok rental shop. This palace was a nice place to take a lot of pictures.","February 16, 2018"
"It's a great cheap little thing you can do for an hour or two. I think it was 3,000 Won or something like that. Very well preserved and very beautiful, but unless you time your visit right with the tour or any shows, it's hard to stay entertained for so long. The museum next door is fantastic, though. All in all, if you're visiting Seoul it's definitely a place to see.","February 16, 2018"
"It's definitely not as big as the Forbidden Palace in Beijing; however, it's still worth a visit. The layout is similar with gates and buildings where the Royalties would enjoy entertainment, and such. It's great to see the urban city behind the Palace and admission included a visit to the Folk Museum, which was worth a stopover to see their exhibitions. Great place to take photos if you decide to borrow and wear a hanbok.","February 15, 2018"
"Just like Changdeokgung Palace, Gyeongbokgung Palace is grand, beautiful and peaceful. Well preserved. You can also catch the changing of the guard if you time your visit right. Worth a visit.","February 15, 2018"

Another attraction is the changing of royal guards ceremony located in one of the gates (Gwanghwamun gate). You can see a lot of tourists and locals wearing traditional clothing (Hanbok) and you can wear one too (but with a corresponding fee) to add to the vibe. It is so crowded when we visited-an hour before noon.","January 22, 2018"
The palace is huge and not at all stroller friendly.There are lots of stairs not suitable for strollers. Can get very crowded. We did the English guided tour which provided us some good insight. There were guards standing at the main gate and everyone was clicking photos with them. Very well connected to the subway.,"January 21, 2018"

"A nice place to spend an hour or two wandering the grounds. Walking tours in multiple languages are conducted every 2-3 hours or so. There is lots of history to be learned here, and many beautiful photo opportunities!","January 21, 2018"
"This palace is the biggest among the other 5 palaces in Seoul. It is huge and grand and a great way to spend a relaxing morning. The palace buildings are beautifully restored and its granduer really impressed me. You can easily spend 4 hours just looking at every nook and cranny. Do allocate some time to watch the changing of guards at the main Gwanghwamun gate. Do not rush through this attraction as you sit down at the many seats provided to just watch the relaxing scenery.National Folk Museum of Korea is also situated in the Palace's ground. I was able to enter the museum FOC with the Palace ticket.With such a big ground to cover and a museum to visit, do wear comfortable walking shoes, bring drinking water and your camera. I believe you will enjoy your visit as much as I did.","January 21, 2018"

This place is huge! My feet got tired just walking around this place and didnt have the energy to go to another palace. There are shops nearby where you can rent hanbok so better to rentone before going around to take photos :),"January 22, 2018"

"Well, when our family went to Seoul, we visited Gyeongbukgong Palace first. We took the train from Myeongdong Station and got off at Gyeongbukgong Station, then took Exit 5 where it leads you to the palace' left side. You'll know you're there when you reach The National Folk Museum of Korea next to it. The palace entrance was big and had guards on it, you can take photos of them, they wont hurt you. The ticket booth should be at the side of the gate. After going inside the palace gate, i was impressed by the beautiful architecture especially when you reach the main palace. Prior to the main palace you'll be crossing a bridge where the scenery is good for taking photos. The main palace is big enough that even if from afar, you can clearly see the sharp details of Korean Traditional Architecture. Inside, you can see a sacred place with murals on the panels and ceiling. At the right side of the main palace there is also a garden where you can enjoy the scenery of the garden, At the back of the palace is the village, where there are houses and crafts. Although i wasnt intrested in that part compared to the main palace.Overall, i think the Gyeongbukgong palace tour would take you 2 hours to explore and take photos. There is no need to spend half a day there. Also, for those renting a hanbok, there is a rental shop outside the palace (few blocks outisde at the station) or inside the palace itself. The staff and guides were accomdating to tourists. Gyeongbukgong Palace is actually a must see site if you're planning to visit Seoul.","January 14, 2018"
"i am so amazed of the korean people on how they preserved gyeongbukgung palace. it is really beautiful and a place where tourist must not fail to visit. i would like to try the costume but because of so much cold, i will just try next time. ","January 14, 2018"
" I visited Gyeongbokgung palace with my family (kids between 7-14) and it was a lot of fun. The entry was very reasonable as it was 9,500 won for 5 tickets. The grounds are very large and plan to stay for 2 or so hours to wander around if you’re not part of a tour. Additionally the palace museum is on the west side of the grounds and is free of charge as well as the Seoul Metro exit comes directly into the palace grounds. I highly recommend to go to see the history of Korea. ","January 13, 2018"
I entered from the Folk village entrance which caused me to miss a half of the park. Enter from the main entrance ask for the information booth set up to use their free guided tour which goes out every 1.5 hours. They will take you to all the main spots you need to go to. They also have 2 different types of the changing of the guards show. It was fantastic ,"January 13, 2018"
"Visited here during the month of September 2017. Its a must see palace if you are visiting Seoul. It's quite a big palace and will take you around 2 hrs to cover it fully. The palace has an entry fee of 3000 Korean won. There is also another ticket which cover 5 palaces and valod for a month I guess, buying that ticket will get you a good deal if you are planning to visit all palaces.Also the guards changing ceremony is the one which everyone looks forward for.As I remember it starts at 2. So be there in time to witnesses it.After the ceremony you can also get pictures clicked besides the guards.Also around the palace you will find shop's were you can rent the traditional Korean attire and visit the palace in that attire.","January 13, 2018"
"We enjoyed visiting this with our tour guide- he was able to get us to the best place to view the changing of the guard, and also helping to find a close place to rent Hanbok and Joseon-era clothing for taking pictures at the Palace during changing of the guard. We usually are not the type to do cosplay but this was actually a really fun way to go around the palace grounds. If you do rent costumes, admission is free into the palace grounds.

It was a huge place which we would not have appreciated if not for the free guided tour in English. The guides were waiting off Exit 5 of Gyeongbukgung Station and would offer visitors a free English tour. Yes...free! Our guide spoke eloquently in English and was very knowledgeable in history of the palace and explained to us intricate details of its construction to both keep the king and his family comfortable as well as protected from threats.

I was blown away by how beautiful the buildings were and the amazing craftsmanship. This place was very clean and had lots of great sights. The space is very open with lots of area to roam and take pictures. This is a must see if you are in Seoul, South Korea.","January 7, 2018"
"A very nice palace that will bring you right back into the olden days era. If you wish to rent hambok,they do not offer it at the palace. You have to head to the shops outside the palace to rent it. It is very easy to find. Overall a very nice palace. ","January 7, 2018"
We arrived to the palace as the free tour was about to take place. The tour goes for around an hr to an hour and a half.

"While the entrance seems packed because everyone was waiting for the changing service of the guards, the inner compound wasn't that crowded. There are a few lakes in the palace however one of it was under renovation during our visit. The compound of the palace is huge and we took our own time to take photographs. People who dress up in traditional hanbok could enter free of charge. Nice and quiet place. ","January 4, 2018"

"Although the palace is huge, there are actually limited opportunity to view the interior of the building. Having said that, those that we were able to, had simple open structure within the building, unlike the Chinese or Japanese palaces. Nevertheless, appreciate its culture for what it is. Watch the change of guards and join the free guided tours (check out the timing)","January 3, 2018"
"Large historic palace and garden with multiple buildings, gardens, artificial lake, etc. Plan 3-4 hours to visit the place. The royal changing of the guard ceremony is held at the main gate hourly from 10:00 to 15:00 and is well worth visiting. Plan your timing so as to be at the main gate on the top of the hour either at the beginning or end or your visit. We visited on a beautiful day in the fall with some of the trees in autumn colors and a nice reflection of the Gyeonghoeru pavilion in the water. At the exit from the subway, underneath the National Palace Museum of Korea, is the modern small museum shop and good-sized café Gogungddurak where you can have a simple good meal for lunch.","January 3, 2018"
Amazing place and lots to see.The guard ceremony is not to be missed at the gate followed by the free tour. Guide was knowledgeable and interacted with the group to make the hour plus walking interactive and interesting.Station right at the front of the park makes getting there and back again easy.There early January and was a fresh minus 4 outside plus a bit of cooling wind.

"This past summer I took a trip to South Korea with the Korean Ties program. This was my first trip to Asia. Visiting Gyeongbokgung Palace was one of the first places we visited. I was blown away by how beautiful the buildings were and the amazing craftsmanship. This place was very clean and had lots of great sights. The space is very open with lots of area to roam and take pictures. This is a must see if you are in Seoul, South Korea.","January 7, 2018"
"A very nice palace that will bring you right back into the olden days era. If you wish to rent hambok,they do not offer it at the palace. You have to head to the shops outside the palace to rent it. It is very easy to find. Overall a very nice palace. ","January 7, 2018"
We arrived to the palace as the free tour was about to take place. The tour goes for around an hr to an hour and a half. The tour guide was very well knowledgeable and lead the tour in an interesting way. I was never once felt bored or disinterested. The palace is a beautiful place with lots of photo opportunities if you decide to dress up. The tour take you to the main areas but there a plenty of other area to explore. ,"January 6, 2018"
"While the entrance seems packed because everyone was waiting for the changing service of the guards, the inner compound wasn't that crowded. There are a few lakes in the palace however one of it was under renovation during our visit. The compound of the palace is huge and we took our own time to take photographs. People who dress up in traditional hanbok could enter free of charge. Nice and quiet place. ","January 4, 2018"
Very clean and spacious with minimal queue. Managed to catch e change of guards and there is english tours as well but we were ok to wander on our own amd explore. Trend to rent a traditional costume and walk around taking pics. Worth a visit and its free!,"January 3, 2018"
"Although the palace is huge, there are actually limited opportunity to view the interior of the building. Having said that, those that we were able to, had simple open structure within the building, unlike the Chinese or Japanese palaces. Nevertheless, appreciate its culture for what it is. Watch the change of guards and join the free guided tours (check out the timing)","January 3, 2018"
"Large historic palace and garden with multiple buildings, gardens, artificial lake, etc. Plan 3-4 hours to visit the place. The royal changing of the guard ceremony is held at the main gate hourly from 10:00 to 15:00 and is well worth visiting. Plan your timing so as to be at the main gate on the top of the hour either at the beginning or end or your visit. We visited on a beautiful day in the fall with some of the trees in autumn colors and a nice reflection of the Gyeonghoeru pavilion in the water. At the exit from the subway, underneath the National Palace Museum of Korea, is the modern small museum shop and good-sized café Gogungddurak where you can have a simple good meal for lunch.","January 3, 2018"
Amazing place and lots to see.The guard ceremony is not to be missed at the gate followed by the free tour. Guide was knowledgeable and interacted with the group to make the hour plus walking interactive and interesting.Station right at the front of the park makes getting there and back again easy.There early January and was a fresh minus 4 outside plus a bit of cooling wind. Rug up with some good warm clothes for the hour or so of walking the grounds.Well worth a few hours to go and see.,"January 3, 2018"
"Second time coming here still beautiful as always. Amazing palaces with lots of history. The lake was under renovation though so that was a miss. In general, a must go if you come to Seoul.","January 3, 2018"
"A little sparse on a cold snowy day. Tour guides on hand to assist, but not a massive amount to see. Should be combined with other local museums/attractions. ","January 2, 2018"
The palace is well preserved but i guess that's the reason why visitors are not allowed to enter. the entrance fee is cheap and you are required to join their in-house tour depending on the language of your preference.,"January 2, 2018"
Very beautiful palaces but can require A LOT of walking. Place is suitable for families with kids. Very beautiful if you visit in Winter and Autumn. ,"January 2, 2018"
"We visited the Palace on 16 Dec and it was freezing though the sun was shining brightly. Before we arrive at the Palace, we were greeted by 2 student volunteers who brought us to purchase our tickets and showed us around the palace and explained the history of the Palace to us. The free tour was awesome and educational!","January 1, 2018"
"Enjoy the palace on snowy days, I think it is more beautiful that way. Atleast what my family & I did! Only 4- because there is not much to see. When you are inside there may be a second museum which holds different event for different seasons. There you have to pay aswell, nothing is free in this world my sons. ","January 1, 2018"
We enjoyed a free (English language) tour of the Palace and it did help explain many of the significances that merely viewing on ones own does not enable,"January 1, 2018"
"Got to witness the “changing of the guard”. Although more theatrical than a Military Parade and Review I’ve seen in other countries, it looks more traditional.","January 1, 2018"
"Brought my family with a total of 7 adults and 1 toddler. The Palace was crowded and it was a great place to take pictures. If you were to visit this place during winter. Be prepared that it will be rather cold in the Palace. To get a free entry to the Palace, you can rent a Hanok during your entry to the premise. Being there, twice. ","January 1, 2018"

"Do plan for a full day trip if you can afford the time. It's easy to go there by subway. Plan your arrival time to catch the Guards Mounting ceremony at about 10 am. If you are early, you can watch their rehearsal too. You can consider buying their all places entrance tickets at only KRW10000. That entitles you to visit 3 other palaces/shrine. You may spend more time in the palace tour if you like to take beautiful pictures. Plenty of nice photo locations especially if you are couples! Do have a good breakfast before going in as there's no food/ drinks available. You should not miss the free English speaking guide tour which can last about an hour plus. Lastly, you will probably enjoy the free museum tour which is located adjacent to the palace. A good tour may take up to more than 2 hours. Overall it's a very fulfilling educational tour for the family.","December 31, 2017"
"Very convenient to the hotel we were at, it was new year's day and very popular for the traditional dress since it was a culture day, which is the last weekend of every month. The only thing that sucked was the museum was closed, other than that, it was totally worth the wall. It is a bit new in some aspects, but really considering the damages to it during the war, I would hope they had repaired and repainted certain areas, it isn't a war memorial after all.","December 31, 2017"
"This is a special place for Koreans. During the Japanese occupation the palace was destroyed and a huge Japanese administration building was erected by the Japanese instead. I saw this some 20 years ago. Now the Japanese building which also hosted a big museum was torne down by the Koreans and the Palace reconstructed. More reconstruction is planned. Koreans are proud about their history. So the change of the guard, all in traditional clothes , is quite impressive. Many Korean women visitors show up in their traditional dresses, the Hanbok, which stems from the time of the Korean empire.","December 31, 2017"

"What a pleasant visit! Let me just start saying how nice Seoul and it's people are. As a solo tourist I had to ask for assistance every now and then. About Gyeongbokgung, it is a lovely palace full of history of the Joseon Dynasty. I was approached by a high school tour guide who offered me her services as a guide of the Gyeongbokgung palace as an opportunity for her to speak English. She showed me the palace grounds, explained about life during the dynasty. Interesting to think how the empress life was lonely and how she would never leave the palace again, even after the wasn't the empress anymore. The palace is beautiful in its simplicity. Totally worth a visit.","December 30, 2017"
"Stunning, amazing and very accessible. Handbook rental adds to the experience. $3.00 entrance fee and $10.00 if want to dress up and pretend you are in the Joseon era. ","December 29, 2017"

Very much accessible via train or bus, but get ready to walk and walk to see its beauty. The pavilion there is the one featured in the drama Rooftop Prince which made me more excited to see it. Just 3000yen for the entrance and they have hourly walking tours if you'd like to join. Also, the entrance is free if you're wearing a hanbok!

"If arriving via the subway (Gyeongbokgung station), the palace is only a short 5min stroll. The subway exit opens up next to the National Palace Museum inside the palace grounds. It is worth going to the front entrance (Gwanghwamun gate) for the Gwanghwamun plaza and statue of Admiral Yi Sun Sin. This front gate is also where the changing of the guards take place. Back inside the palace grounds, the ticket counters are along the east side of the complex, audio guides are available for rent, recommended for more insight about the palace as there are limited signage in the palace. Apparently people wearing hanboks get a discounted price for ticket entry or possibly free.The courtyards are well laid for an easy stroll and looked after along with manicured gardens.

Here's 2 considerations which may be helpful if you are travelling in the winter months:1. Every last wed of the month is free entry. So if you are travelling end of the month, consider visiting on a wed. The palace is close on Tue anyway.2. Consider wearing long john or thermal undergarments if you plan to dress up in hanok as it get very chilling & windy in the big palace. The palace is very well preserved & clean. However, it is also very crowded with many tourists especially in the front, making it very hard to take pictures without being 'photobomb' by visitors.

The detailing and shape of the roofs are unique, and the large number of carved stone figures, some of them unfortunately encased in transparent boxes due to unruly visitors, interesting indeed.

"Being a fan of kdrama, I have watched several period drama where the plot is in Josean era. Gyeongbokgung palace reminds me of these drama and it gave me a lot of goosebumps.

"Worth checking out. Palace, although smaller than the Forbidden City, was still quite large. Was nice to walk through it and see all the fall colours. Be sure to check out the elevated pagoda thing by the pond in the middle. The view of the mountains is also very nice when you walk further Northwest. You can't see inside many buildings though so you don't really need to walk through it all. You won't miss much if you don't, save the view.","November 30, 2017"

This is the highlight of Seoul for sure. It's so full of culture and beauty. Walk around the grounds and the gardens. I also highly recommend stopping at the tea house for some traditional tea and snacks. The tea was delicious; the snacks were...interesting. But it was such a great experience!

"Gyeongbokgung is the biggest palace in Seoul. It is near the City Hall, Insadong and is easily accessed by metro (blue line to Jongak Station). If you enter the Palace through Gwanghwamun, you will find the information center on your right. There is an entrance fee of 10000W per adult. You can check out the free guided tour (1 hour; in English) and the time of the guard change. You can also get a palace map (in English). We used it to navigate and find washrooms.The guided tour was very informative and the tour guide spoke fluent English. The tour guide showed us different buildings / courts where the King, the Queen and the Queen mother lived. She also pointed out the in-floor heating system used in those buildings and where were the chimneys. It definitely helped us understand more about the Korean culture, architecture and how the royal family lived. We saw a lot of young students and teenagers dressed up with the traditional Hanbok. It makes it seem like you are at the ancient time. The Palace is huge and has a strong contrast with its surrounding buildings. The architecture of the buildings is unique and all of the buildings are nicely maintained. There is a museum, gift shops and a snack bar inside the Palace. There are washrooms near the entrance and museum. We spent about 4 hours in the Palace. After we exited the Palace through the main entrance, we strolled around the area on the left of the Palace. There are lots of cafes, restaurants, a Daiso etc. We had lunch at a famous restaurant for ginseng chicken soup (Tosokchon). We really enjoy all the visits.My tip to the Palace: go there early in the morning and take lots of pictures first. Then join the free guided tour (the first one is 11am).","November 28, 2017"

Without one of these, or a Korean speaker, you will be pretty-much in the dark as to the function of buildings and underlying stories. The only building open to view is the impressive throne room and the only one that you can get inside is a small memorial to a queen who was murdered by a Japanese hit-squad for opposing their takeover.I would time a visit to take in the changing of the guard: OK, they are actors but it is well-worth the twenty minutes (and you can get into the front court to see it without paying).","November 19, 2017"
Fair warning the palace is huge. Lots of photo taking opportunities especially if you're into renting the traditional costumes. There are several opportunities to catch actors reenacting scenes of the king and queen moving around with their entourage. Also the change of guard ceremony really brings you back in time.

Not many employees there to help answer a question if we had any but that did not detract from a very pleasant and inexpensive (less than 5 euro) walk around a beautiful area.

"The Gyeongbokgung Palace is very large and it’s a pleasant walk around the structures and green spaces. To get there, get off at the Gyeongbokgung station (metro/bus) its 2 blocks away/ 5 min walk to the palace, some buses may take you just in front of the palace but check your route for details. Maybe before or after your visit you may enjoy a lunch at Tosokchon Samgyetang (opens at 10:30) only a short walk away, they are known for their ginger chicken soup but expect long lines after 12 noon. I didn't think there was a lot to see but architecture and the cultural value is worth a visit. You can try to be at the front entrance for the changing of the guard at 11:00 and 13:00 (free). I must warn you the changing of the guard is more of a reenactment and is a bit “cheesy” as the guards are more actors than real guards, they're pictures ops for tourists, the fake beards doesn't help. I would think as part of the job they would have to have a real one. If you want to go inside go to the right pass the entrance to get a ticket, 3000w/pp. I recommend making your way up to the National Folk Museum of Korea and exit the palace by the gates just below. That exit gate is only a short walk to the Bukchon Hanok Village.","November 17, 2017"
"This palace complex is easily reached by the metro. It offers a very nice day visit in autumn to view some autumn foliage, and offers large areas of walking spaces. The attractions are nicely spaced out, sothat even though there are huge numbers of visitors, we were able to easily find some quiet spots to relax and see some of the structural attractions.Allow about half a day to view the different structural buildings in a relaxing mode. There was an ongoing renovation of some iconic sights in the palace complex which we were not informed. But still, it made for a nice autumn day trip. In terms of autumn foliage, Deoksugung is more spectacular.Public restrooms were extremely clean, as always we have experienced in Seoul.","November 17, 2017"

Full of colored leaves every where. The weather was great so we could enjoy the nature literally. Full of visitors in traditional customs that make the garden more beautiful. The house “Geonchung-gung” where King Gojong and Queen Min lived together was still open for public. Geonchung gung is the place where Queen Min was assassinated by Japanese street gangsters. ,"November 15, 2017"
"This palace is really beautiful and really huge. Even though there was a lot of people, you can just turn a corner and found out you are alone in this place filled with history. Do take the guided tour although my tour guide was not really that good. After that, do take your own time exploring the palace. The gardens are especially gorgeous during the autumn season. Do not miss the guard changing ceremony.","November 14, 2017"
Nice historical palace in Seoul you will enjoy typical Korean architecture and history with lovely style and colors,"November 18, 2017"
We visited the palace on the last day. Can only visited part of it because we need to go another place. The weather was sunny. Many local people wearing the national costume visited the palace. Luckily we can see the shift ceremony.,"November 18, 2017"
This is a must when you visit South Korea!! Be sure to catch the shows offered at 10 AM and 2 PM — gives great insight to the Korean culture. Traditional Korean attire is available for rental at nearby shops — feel free to rent one for the full experience. ,"November 17, 2017"
"The Gyeongbokgung Palace is very large and it’s a pleasant walk around the structures and green spaces. To get there, get off at the Gyeongbokgung station (metro/bus) its 2 blocks away/ 5 min walk to the palace, some buses may take you just in front of the palace but check your route for details. Maybe before or after your visit you may enjoy a lunch at Tosokchon Samgyetang (opens at 10:30) only a short walk away, they are known for their ginger chicken soup but expect long lines after 12 noon. I didn't think there was a lot to see but architecture and the cultural value is worth a visit. You can try to be at the front entrance for the changing of the guard at 11:00 and 13:00 (free). I must warn you the changing of the guard is more of a reenactment and is a bit “cheesy” as the guards are more actors than real guards, they're pictures ops for tourists, the fake beards doesn't help. I would think as part of the job they would have to have a real one. If you want to go inside go to the right pass the entrance to get a ticket, 3000w/pp. I recommend making your way up to the National Folk Museum of Korea and exit the palace by the gates just below. That exit gate is only a short walk to the Bukchon Hanok Village.","November 17, 2017"

"This place brings you back to the monarch times of royal families in South Korea. This is a very huge place with wonderful scenery around during autumn! Leaves of various trees with different leaves colors and hues ranging from reds, browns, yellows, greens to any color you can think of in between those mentioned colors. The royal guard parade in the morning is one of the highlights of the palace visit. Many tourists enjoy the sight in this place along with the 2 more palaces situated nearby this area.

"In every city that you visit, there is always that one place you have to go to otherwise you cant really say that you have been to that place. And I think for Seoul, its this place. On our itenerary, originally we were to visit palaces during a Sunday but because the DMZ tour was fully booked on our scheduled day, we had to rearrange our schedule. So we decided Monday for palaces. Big mistake since all the palaces were closed on Mondays EXCEPT for this one. And we were exceptionally happy that we were lucky enough that this wasnt closed on a Monday because we would have been missign a lot. Now, we went by ourselves to this palace. And I think this place would be visited best with a guide to explain what the buildings were and their importance. When we visited the Forbidden City in Beijing we did so and it was extremely insightful and I wish we did the same when we went to Gyeongbokgung.Now if your here just for some photo ops wearing hanboks, then you wont really care for that tour but for someone who likes history do hire a guide.For photo ops, autumn is a great time for that.

"The nearest metro station is Gyeongbukgung Station on Line 3.This Palace is an impressive set of buildings. It was built three years after the founding of the Joseon Dynasty.

It was again destroyed by Japanese occupation in 1915 and replaced with the headquarters of the Japanese government. The present Korean government has embarked on an ambitious restoration project started in 1990 to bring the palace to its former glory. The backdrop to the palace is Mount Bugak. The main entrance to the palace is through Gwanghwamun Gate. There is a colourful changing of the guard ceremony held every morning. Within the grounds are the National Folk Museum of Korea and the National Palace Museum of Korea.

This palace is big but can get so busy. Watch out for the change of guard ceremony times. The pavillion that I was looking forward to is being renovated until 2019. There's a reason to go back then. :),"November 4, 2017"
Really enjoyed my visit at the Gyeongbokgung Palace. We were able to join a free English tour and the tour guide did an excellent job at explaining some of the palaces history. Tip: Join the free tour group. Check website for time.,"November 3, 2017"
"The last time we were in Seoul about three years back, we chanced on the changing of the guard at the Gwanghwamun in front of the palace. Then it was crowded with throngs of tourists.On this trip with some friends, we decided we would get a good position to see the entire ceremony and visit the palace as well (a bonus was a visit to the National Palace Museum nearby).Since China curtailed visits by its citizens over the installation of anti-missile systems in South Korea, the crowd was much smaller and we were afforded excellent views of the ceremony.The palace too was likewise not very crowded and gave us lots of time to wander about and admire the architecture and the displays.Free admission to both events was a bonus.And there were lots of people in hanboks, or traditional Korean dress,A while back, a rule was introduced that people wearing hanboks (Korean or otherwise), did not have to pay for entry into the various palaces that charged entry.It was quite amusing to see Caucasians, South Asians, and pretty much everything in between in hanbok.The changing of the guard ceremony is held three times a day, 11.00 a.m., 1.30 p.m. and 3.00 p.m. But check the website and tourist guides.","November 1, 2017"

"Visited on a weekend break to Seoul. Entry to everything was free but not sure if that was because it was Chuseok. The whole place is amazing, really well preserved and rebuilt. The contrast between the skyscrapers and the ancient palace is amazing! When we went there were Koreans dressed in traditional dress walking around and if you turned the corner to an empty courtyard with only a couple of Koreans dressed in Hambok walking along you felt like you'd gone back in time! It's an absolute must in Seoul!!","October 17, 2017"

"We walked to the Palace from Hanok village. From the outside palace doesn’t seem that big, but once you get inside it’s easy to get lost. For someone who lives in China and who saw so many temples Palace itself wasn’t anything new or breathtaking, but for people who have never been to Asia I’m sure it’s breathtaking. I loved the nature. In the end we saw guards in front of the main entrance. They have their show every hour or two. Make sure to rent hanok before coming to the palace to feel like a part of history :)","October 15, 2017"
"This is a must-see place, but it's also one of those that doesn't really have any surprises. Splendid architecture, and impressive site and sense of history, but I sort of knew what to expect.

"Gyeongbokgung Palace was crowded as it was Chuseok, translated as ""Korean Thanksgiving"" in English. We watched the changing of the guards which displayed colorful uniforms, musical instruments, and formations for the traditional ceremony. One must be in good shape to climb the stairs to the palace.","October 17, 2017"
"Visited on a weekend break to Seoul. Entry to everything was free but not sure if that was because it was Chuseok. The whole place is amazing, really well preserved and rebuilt. The contrast between the skyscrapers and the ancient palace is amazing! When we went there were Koreans dressed in traditional dress walking around and if you turned the corner to an empty courtyard with only a couple of Koreans dressed in Hambok walking along you felt like you'd gone back in time! It's an absolute must in Seoul!!","October 17, 2017"
"If u are hanging around seoul u must visit this place, and if u rent an hanbok it will be even better :)","October 17, 2017"
"The Palace's royal guard changing ceremony is the best experience, providing very good experience of traditional Korea culture and traditional army clothes. The Palace s very similar to China' Forbidden City but i a smaller scale.","October 17, 2017"
"We walked to the Palace from Hanok village. From the outside palace doesn’t seem that big, but once you get inside it’s easy to get lost. For someone who lives in China and who saw so many temples Palace itself wasn’t anything new or breathtaking, but for people who have never been to Asia I’m sure it’s breathtaking. I loved the nature. In the end we saw guards in front of the main entrance. They have their show every hour or two. Make sure to rent hanok before coming to the palace to feel like a part of history :)","October 15, 2017"
"This is a must-see place, but it's also one of those that doesn't really have any surprises. Splendid architecture, and impressive site and sense of history, but I sort of knew what to expect. Both palaces are worthwhile, and this a bit grander, but with the crowds its not really anything that knocks your socks off, which is why I gave it a 4 and not a 5. ","October 15, 2017"
We had a great day visiting this palace and decided to make a special effort to hire costumes for the family which would gain us free entry into the place as an added bonus.. there are lots of places you can do this and the staff are very helpful in dressing you! As English visitors we were in the minority! It was a very hot day and could only last two hours in the costume but the place could easily be experienced in this time ,"October 15, 2017"
"For those who are familiar with korean drama, you would recognise the buildings from this palace. I visited this palace 8 years ago and it is still beautiful. Visitors wearing the traditional hanbok can enter the palaces for free! This is an experience everyone should try.. donning the hanbok in the palace and admiring the beauty of history.

"Possibly the largest of the five main palaces in the centre of Seoul, Gyeongbokgung has a lot to see, but it's all rather 'samey'. The original palace is long gone and like the other four, this is a recreation that was redone in 2007. It's hard to imagine the original palaces were as drab and austere as the recreations, but I definitely don't believe they all had exactly the same brickwork, exactly the same woodwork and all had exactly the same paint jobs. The result is that as you wander around, you just see the same thing over and over. Like all the other palaces, you cannot enter any of the buildings. Two of the largest buildings have open doors so you can see inside, but that's as close as you get. The Hyangwonjeong Pavilion is completely closed for renovation as of October 2017 and you can only visit the Gyeonghoeru Pavilion if you have pre-booked (and presumably paid a separate fee). Make sure you buy the Palace Pass for W10,000 as that will give you a big discount on the five palaces and the shrine that it covers. If you turn up in traditional Korean clothing, you get in free (that's true of all the palaces). However, since you have to pay W10,000 for four hours to rent the costume, it's no saving at all.","October 13, 2017"
Came here on the tour provided from the airport during a layover. The architecture is just amazing. Photos don't capture just how grand it really is to stand under these amazing buildings. Enjoyed the changing of the guard ceremony. Since this was part of a larger tour we only had about an hour to see the front area and chamber. As I understand it there was much more to see that we just didn't have time for. ideal plan to spend 2-3 (maybe more depending on your stamina and interest level). Enjoy a beautiful picnic.

"The area offers a glimpse of the royal past of korea. It provides a better understanding of korean palace life.Tips:- rent a hanbok and walk around in traditional attire (most rentals also include free entrance to related sites)- there are free walking tours (english ) so good to check the schedule at the entrance- study the package offers (single entry ticket vs all entry ticket to 5 related sites) before buying your ticket...and grab a map at the ticket area (maps are free)- wear comfortable shoes, clothing and sunblock...- make sure to hydrate and have a lip balm handy (weather can be sunny AND windy)- for those with medical condition or are easily hungry, bring a snack if you plan to tour everything that is on the map :)- watch out for changing of the guards and other ""presentations""- you can take a picture of/with the guards...the only reminder given was to please not touch them- take your time, appreciate the past and enjoy the stories behind each structure","October 3, 2017"

It provides a better understanding of korean palace life.Tips:- rent a hanbok and walk around in traditional attire (most rentals also include free entrance to related sites)- there are free walking tours (english ) so good to check the schedule at the entrance- study the package offers (single entry ticket vs all entry ticket to 5 related sites) before buying your ticket...and grab a map at the ticket area (maps are free)- wear comfortable shoes, clothing and sunblock...- make sure to hydrate and have a lip balm handy (weather can be sunny AND windy)- for those with medical condition or are easily hungry, bring a snack if you plan to tour everything that is on the map :)- watch out for changing of the guards and other ""presentations""- you can take a picture of/with the guards...the only reminder given was to please not touch them- take your time, appreciate the past and enjoy the stories behind each structure","October 3, 2017"
If u have extra time in d city n get bored of people watchingCome here for a peaceful one hr or two before flying off,"October 3, 2017"
This was absolutely stunning and historical. It is located in a very central area that is easy to get to via metro. I would give this place at least half a day because there is so much to see and there is also another museum that lies inside of the palace. You should also go around the Hanok Village Area to rent a Hanbok to walk around the palace and neighborhood to take pictures. You can even enter the palace for free if you walk in with your Hanbok.,"October 2, 2017"
Crowded but worth it. You can spend just and hour and see the highlights or go slow and spend hours just experiencing history.Go early in the day to avoid some crowds.,"October 2, 2017"

Me and my friends have decided to have a walk and see around in Seoul and that’s a place where we wanted to try The place a bit crowded and really nice to see ,"October 2, 2017"
"This a major sightseeing location and is popular. Go early! It is excellent, there are many building to see. try to get there for the spectacular Changing of the Guard all done is some amazing costumes.","October 2, 2017"
Our visit coincided with Moon Festival so admission was free and the timing coincided with the Changing of the Guard ceremony. Very colourful and unlike any other such ceremony anywhere else. The palace itself is definitely worth a visit with a lot of interesting buildings and architecture. The area is quite large and there is also an entrance to National Folk Museum which has a very welcome cafeteria/snack bar.,"October 2, 2017"
We went during the Oct holidays so there was a lot of local Koreans wearing their traditional cloths The palace has a lot of buildings and is next to a museum of Korean history The buildings are very busy impressive particularly since it is in the middle of Seoul. Highly recommended ,"October 1, 2017"

"Peaceful, serene royal and most importantly a must-see attraction in Seoul.I am not a history or touristy place visitor. I enjoy beach, quiet and easy-going places. This time me and my wife visited this Palace just to see how the look and feel of the place is. It is really a place for spending quiet time and get lost in your thoughts. The lake and structure in the middle is really something one should experience. The calmness and cool breeze even in the may-june afternoon sun does makes it relaxing. They have folk dance and song show at the palace. Coffee shop is a typical touristy place for drinks and leisure out. Overall, if you are a history-buff do visit this place.Cheers,BokaBoy","September 29, 2017"

" You can see the pure art of Joseon Dynasty. Some stupids always said that it is quite smaller than chinese or japanese palace and nothing impressive. Yes, it is true that Gyeongbokgung is 30% smaller than Beijing palace. So what? If you want to see just big palace just go to the north korea, there is world's biggest palace(Kim il sung palace). Chinise palaces were built on the massive flat ground just to show their power to the world. Japanese palaces were built to fight against the other clans.

We visited the palace on a beautiful sunny day. It was beautiful the grounds and buildings are in great condition. We saw the changing of the guards which was great to see. Lots of people there had rented 'hanbok' the traditional style dresses to walk around the palace and get some great pictures in the beautiful scenery. I felt a little under dressed without one. Would deffinatley recommend renting them from nearby as we noticed after we had been around the palace. Worth a trip here. ,"September 10, 2017"
"The place is nice but it looks always the same, from the entrance to the center and surrounding . A small concert was on, and many girls were wearing typical korean old time dress, nice to see and to listen at . My young guide, a 15 yo volontaire , have been very kind . Very interesting to know that the floor heating have not been invented recently and probably not in Europe, ... no idea . ","September 10, 2017"
We had a great tour guide and he made the tour enjoyable but the palace was not as nice or as visually interesting as the one in Beijing. Since it was rebuilt recently it lacks the historical feel of other similar palaces.

"Very Interesting to understand how the medieval koreans lived. Also it shows how well preserved the palace has been kept. Its really cool to see the inner infrastructure of the rooms and quarters that the King , Queen and the maids lived in.

" You can see the pure art of Joseon Dynasty. Some stupids always said that it is quite smaller than chinese or japanese palace and nothing impressive. Yes, it is true that Gyeongbokgung is 30% smaller than Beijing palace. So what? If you want to see just big palace just go to the north korea, there is world's biggest palace(Kim il sung palace). Chinise palaces were built on the massive flat ground just to show their power to the world. Japanese palaces were built to fight against the other clans.

I visited around 3 pm on a drizzly weekday afternoon and found the palace to be wonderfully uncrowded. The free English tour was a nice way to learn more about Korean history, but I also recommend taking the time to explore some of the more remote areas of the palace--the buildings are just as nicely restored and most people don't bother to walk that far in so it felt like I had the whole place to myself.","September 4, 2017"

My family had a great time walking around the palace wearing the traditional Korean clothes and took a lot of photos. We were quite surprised to see how many dressed up like us.

What a stunning palace and what an amazing opportunity for anyone to learn so much about a country's history that no school would ever teach. Visiting this palace was one of the best things I have ever done for myself. This visit made me realize just how little we learn about Asian history in the West and I lamented this but welcomed and enjoyed the opportunity to remedy this sad reality at least a little by learning as much as I could. I was so impressed by the meticulous care of this historical place. Authorities in Seoul ought to be applauded for their exceptional care of this historical jewel. This is not a place you can visit in just an hour or two. Take your time! See all the details, read everything, learn and enjoy! It'll transport you to ancient times long gone and to such a different culture and world you could never imagine unless you went there yourself. We spent an entire day here and loved everything, from the unique and delicate gardens, to the royal chambers of the king, the superb collections of antiques that show different times in Korean history. The pagodas are exquisite, the details of the architecture, even the small village of their servants provided a clear contrast that showed how differently their servants lived within the palace. We also marveled at the great contrast between this ancient structure next The the modern city surrounding it. Absolutely magnificent!","August 25, 2017"

"My husband and I actually went to see Gwanghwamun Gate (The main gate to the palace) under the night lights not realising the palace was open at night. After a couple photo's at the front we tentatively walked in and joined the short que for a ticket.It wasn't that crowded to begin with and we were close to the front of the line when the gates opened. If your ever in the same position when the gates open, don't follow the crowd and walk straight. Walk to the left and through a side door. That was where the magic started for us. as it slowly got darker and the palace just became magical, the only thing that could have enhanced it is with fireflies (not possible, but it does let your imagination go.) After that it becomes harder to fully enjoy the palace with so many people and children. So many people looking for the perfect selfie in front of everything. We went again to the first area at the end of our trek around the palace, but the magic was lost with the shear number of people there.People forget about the history of the palace and what it has seen, it became a beautiful scene to take selfies before moving to the next beautiful scene. Not to say we didn't take any selfies, but we took a moment to read what little english text there was and to just imagine what it was like in that era.","August 25, 2017"
"This was our favorite palace to visit during the trip. It is the restored main royal palace of the Joseon Dynasty. The architecture was awesome. Enjoyed walking through the various areas. Takes you back in history and people dressed in tradition dress added to the experience. There is also a museum. The palace museum and front area where the changing of the guards happens are free. However, to get into the main palace grounds there is an admission charge. Ticket was only 3,000 KRW when we were there.","August 24, 2017"
"A really beautiful place. I wish we had more time there as we were with a tour company and they were rushing us a bit. However, we were lucky to catch to the changing of the guard ceremony - really took you back in time... Not only is it beautiful to see the grounds, the gardens and the buildings but how interactive it is - you could dress up in traditional hanbok and walk around. We didn't do it because it would have been too hot but I can only imagine how that could help you feel, imagine what it may have been like once a upon a time... in some areas of the palace in the village area there were rooms where one could actually nap like they did back then. You take your shoes off and lay down on the floor and nap! So cool! I would love to go back when cooler and try the full experience.","August 23, 2017"

After a couple photo's at the front we tentatively walked in and joined the short que for a ticket.It wasn't that crowded to begin with and we were close to the front of the line when the gates opened. If your ever in the same position when the gates open, don't follow the crowd and walk straight. Walk to the left and through a side door. That was where the magic started for us. as it slowly got darker and the palace just became magical, the only thing that could have enhanced it is with fireflies (not possible, but it does let your imagination go.) After that it becomes harder to fully enjoy the palace with so many people and children. So many people looking for the perfect selfie in front of everything. We went again to the first area at the end of our trek around the palace, but the magic was lost with the shear number of people there.People forget about the history of the palace and what it has seen, it became a beautiful scene to take selfies before moving to the next beautiful scene. Not to say we didn't take any selfies, but we took a moment to read what little english text there was and to just imagine what it was like in that era.","August 25, 2017"
"This was our favorite palace to visit during the trip. It is the restored main royal palace of the Joseon Dynasty. The architecture was awesome. Enjoyed walking through the various areas. Takes you back in history and people dressed in tradition dress added to the experience. There is also a museum. The palace museum and front area where the changing of the guards happens are free. However, to get into the main palace grounds there is an admission charge. Ticket was only 3,000 KRW when we were there.","August 24, 2017"
"A really beautiful place. I wish we had more time there as we were with a tour company and they were rushing us a bit. However, we were lucky to catch to the changing of the guard ceremony - really took you back in time... Not only is it beautiful to see the grounds, the gardens and the buildings but how interactive it is - you could dress up in traditional hanbok and walk around. We didn't do it because it would have been too hot but I can only imagine how that could help you feel, imagine what it may have been like once a upon a time... in some areas of the palace in the village area there were rooms where one could actually nap like they did back then. You take your shoes off and lay down on the floor and nap! So cool! I would love to go back when cooler and try the full experience.","August 23, 2017"
"If you like to know more about the old Korean Kingdom and see historical buildings, this is a place you should not miss. It is located in the city centre and it is advisable to take metro to go there because, if you drive there, you would have difficulty to park you car. Since the National Folklore Museum is just next door, you may wish to visit both the palace and the museum in one go. As the area is fairly large, please be prepared to allow at least a half day for this visit. ","August 22, 2017"
We visited the palace in April and had a great time. The palace is beautiful and huge! We didn't take a tour so we just wandered around at our own pace. It was awesome getting to watch the changing of the guard ceremony. It takes place several times throughout the day. Don't miss it!,"August 22, 2017"
"Gyeongbokgung Palace is reminiscent of Central Park in that it is situated in the middle of an enormous, loud city but allows for a level of peace and solitude that you wouldn't expect to find. Having been built originally in the 1300s, the palace is a shell of it;'s original self having been destroyed by the Japanese hundreds of years later. That being said, the majority of the building have likely been rebuilt but their beauty and attention to detail are remarkable. A must see while in Seoul.","August 22, 2017"

"I really enjoyed going to Gyeongbokgung. I actually met up with a friend there that I had met on a language exchange app but never met in real life, and we had so much fun! Because that friend insisted on paying for my ticket for me, I don't actually know how much it costs. But I found out from people there that if you go to one of the Hanbok (traditional Korean clothing) stores nearby and pay to rent Hanbok (which you can do, prices vary depending on the outfit you choose and how long you want to borrow it, I borrowed the ""cheap"" outfit for 2 hours and it was 20,000 Won (~$20)) you can enter the palace for free. So it was quite cool, as we walked around the palace, there were people everywhere wearing the traditional Korean palace clothing! Bless their hearts though, that day was HOT. If you come to the palace in the summer, be prepared for that... I was not... lol. Overall it's a gorgeous place to visit and a lovely walk during the day. There's a mini museum/cafe/information center/gift shop near the main building of the palace, so you can go there and enjoy some A/C if you're dying in the heat (like I was). There are also a lot of cute cafes and restaurants nearby that you can go to, with delicious food! Overall, I would recommend visiting this palace, but it's more fun if you go with a friend or a group for sure. :)","August 21, 2017"
The palace is incredably huge. (TIPS) We went to the hanbok rental and got free entry ticket because we use hanbok. People were staring at our group (8 of us walking together with hanbok) but hey we got to take good pictures in hanbok as well. The entrance to the center part is quite the same. Don't take to much time taking picture outside as the inside parts have less people around. Don't forget to come in to the lake. It was beautiful and breathtakingly pretty.,"August 20, 2017"

Prepare to spend about 2 hours if you would like to walk it all. There is locker area near the main gate but I recommend taking your belonging with you because there are other gates that you can exit as you walk deeper into the property.

To get the full traditional Korean experience, you can rent Hanbok (traditional Korean clothing) from many stores near the palace. During the summer, I recommend visiting the palace at night.

"Seoul is definitely not all about just shopping! I went to Seoul for a Year-end holiday with 2 friends and we decided to visit Gyeongbokgung on the first day of 2017. It was a very grand palace with very nice scenery! We took our time to slowly walk around, embracing ourselves in the cultural air. There were many tourists too, well, in fact, a bit too many! It was rather difficult to take any photos without some people ""photo-bombing"" our photos! Well, I guess that can't be helped! Anyway I love watching some ladies wearing the traditional hanboks and taking photos. When we realised that we can rent hanbok, my friend went to rent one immediately and we had fun taking photos and having fun! I would strongly recommend to visit this Palace if you have time in Seoul.","August 2, 2017"
"Gyeongbokgung Palace is LARGE! very, very large. the grounds go on forever and it's size and history is fasinating. They also have fantastic free tour guides that you can book online. However I would probably recommend visiting Changdeokgung Palace instead. Most of Gyeongbokgung Palace was destroyed during the war and is being restored from the ground up to resemble what it would have been like ""back in the day"" so to me it felt a little bit like walking through a theme park. Changdeokgung Palace on the other hand is a world heritage listed site and maintains a lot of it's original structures, it also has a wonderful garden ""secret garden"" that is a favourite for many Seoulites.

"Massive-would be my first reaction to this place. It is a place that you should visit in Seoul to appreciate some histories, traditional Korean architecture and garden. There were a lot of tourists there but the place is so spread out so you won't feel that it's too cramped in there. ( at least the day I was there ). Prepare to spend about 2 hours if you would like to walk it all. There is locker area near the main gate but I recommend taking your belonging with you because there are other gates that you can exit as you walk deeper into the property. And from those gate you can easily walk to other attractions. In summer, bring along umbrella and water.","August 5, 2017"

"My brother and I arrived at the gates of Gyeongbokgung Palace, on a sunny December morning. Exhausted from our debate on how to properly pronounce 'Gyeongbokgung', we were instantly silenced upon being greeted by two stone sculptures. Was it a hairless lion, or a mythical beast? Something to debate as we explored the palace further. Royal Guards dressed in traditional uniforms, swarmed in as we walked through one of three large red doors. Their spears pierced the heavens as they marched towards us in a ceremonial fashion. It was an amazing transition from the busy, modern streets behind the red gates of the palace; like stepping back in time. Alarmed at first, we were relieved to learn it was only the opening of the palace gates that we nearly interrupted. After a pleasant ceremony feature, we proceeded through the massive courtyard, at the entrance, to the ticket booths. The ground was soft. The sand filling the courtyard was fine and yellowish orange in colour. I was fascinated by how comfortable it was to walk on it. I dimwittedly thought there was nothing more to the palace, beyond the courtyard. That was until we advanced further in through the palace's second second gates. We spent 2.5 hours wandering the grounds of Gyeongbokgung Palace, discovering amazing detail in architecture, beautiful natural scenery, and a taste of Korea's history and culture through the people we encountered an learning about the demolition and restoration of the palace.It was not too busy, but if you are trying to capture tourist free photos, you may have to be patient for the perfect moment :D I enjoyed viewing the city, which towered over the walls of the palace, from within the center of the palace. It was an exciting place to be; almost like viewing the future while standing in the past. If you are Palace, Temple, Castle, etc. hoping throughout East Asia, do not miss this palace. There is also plenty to see and do around the palace if you have time to spare in Seoul.","July 25, 2017"

"I enjoy my visit to this palace. You need to get an excellent guide to orientate you around the palace or else everything doesn't really make sense and all you see are just buildings and more buildings. I had a great Korean guide, June who made the tour enjoyable. She even point to us minor details that tourists fail to see.It used to be really grand and there, you will see a portrait of it being even more majestic than before. Sadly, majority of the buildings were destroyed during the Japanese Invasion. Restorations are still taking place.The fun part is the changing of guard ceremony. I think it's a normal ritual in every palace but since we are living in modern time, it's quite fascinating. You can take photos with the guides too.If you know Feng Shui, I was told that this palace was deliberately built around 4 mountains. The mountain behind the palace was Bukhansan, a very beautiful mountain!I enjoy this visit. Love the pictures!","July 20, 2017"

"Most palaces are closed on Mondays, but this one is open Mondays (closed on Tuesdays), so as it was Monday, this is where we decided to go. We timed our visit to coincide with the free English tour along with 50 or so other English-speaking tourists. Luckily, our hanbok-clad tour guide came equipped with a microphone and speaker system so all could hear.Our tour guide started by explaining the history of the palace. The tour then continued passed the Geunjeongjeon Throne Hall, the Gyeonghoeru Pavilion party building, Gangnyeonjeon Hall where the king slept, the queen’s gardens behind Gyotaejeon Hall (queen’s residence), the decorative chimney of the Jagyeongjeon Hall (king’s mother’s residence) and finally to Hyangwonjeon Pavilion (currently under renovation and could only be photographed by holding your camera above the fence — if you’re tall enough). The tour took approx. one hour and was well worth doing.The palace complex was moderately busy and there were many people visiting wearing hanboks. There are many hanbok rental places around the palace. Entry is free when you're in hanbok.","July 20, 2017"
"The Gyeongbokgung Palace is one of the most visited palace in Seoul mainly because it is the main royal palace during the Joseon Dynasty. It brings you back to the old Seoul amidst the highly urbanized backdrop outside the palace. For an added cultural experience, there is a Changing of the Royal Guards ceremony at 10 am and 2 in the afternoon. You also get to try the royal guard costume. ","July 19, 2017"

"I enjoy my visit to this palace. You need to get an excellent guide to orientate you around the palace or else everything doesn't really make sense and all you see are just buildings and more buildings. I had a great Korean guide, June who made the tour enjoyable. She even point to us minor details that tourists fail to see.It used to be really grand and there, you will see a portrait of it being even more majestic than before. Sadly, majority of the buildings were destroyed during the Japanese Invasion. Restorations are still taking place.The fun part is the changing of guard ceremony. I think it's a normal ritual in every palace but since we are living in modern time, it's quite fascinating. You can take photos with the guides too.If you know Feng Shui, I was told that this palace was deliberately built around 4 mountains. The mountain behind the palace was Bukhansan, a very beautiful mountain!I enjoy this visit. Love the pictures!","July 20, 2017"
"When you visit Gyeongbokgung Palace and decided to rent Hanbok before entering, congrats! Your admission to the palace will be free! The palace is so big and well preserved.

"No matter you are korean or foreigner, I strongly recommend to visit this place if you are in seoul. You can see the beauty of korean traditional architecture.

"Most palaces are closed on Mondays, but this one is open Mondays (closed on Tuesdays), so as it was Monday, this is where we decided to go. We timed our visit to coincide with the free English tour along with 50 or so other English-speaking tourists. Luckily, our hanbok-clad tour guide came equipped with a microphone and speaker system so all could hear.Our tour guide started by explaining the history of the palace. The tour then continued passed the Geunjeongjeon Throne Hall, the Gyeonghoeru Pavilion party building, Gangnyeonjeon Hall where the king slept, the queen’s gardens behind Gyotaejeon Hall (queen’s residence), the decorative chimney of the Jagyeongjeon Hall (king’s mother’s residence) and finally to Hyangwonjeon Pavilion (currently under renovation and could only be photographed by holding your camera above the fence — if you’re tall enough). The tour took approx. one hour and was well worth doing.The palace complex was moderately busy and there were many people visiting wearing hanboks. There are many hanbok rental places around the palace. Entry is free when you're in hanbok.","July 20, 2017"
"The Gyeongbokgung Palace is one of the most visited palace in Seoul mainly because it is the main royal palace during the Joseon Dynasty.

The palace is one of the few historical main attractions in the city so we went. We visited in June so the weather was in the 90s F. Since the palace is an open space so I highly recommend to bring an umbrella or sunscreen to reduce exposure to the blazing sun. The main hall is grand and beautiful and you would see many tourists dressed in traditional Korean costume. Expect to do a lot of walking in this area. I didn't visit all the halls as most of them are fairly similar. Therefore i only spent less than 90 mins at the palace. There is also a children's museum on site.

After the ceremony you can exit the side door next to the ticket windows, turn left, and you will pass the parking lot for buses. There is a snack bar and a restroom if you wish to use. Keep walking left passing the palace walls, there should be an Art school on the right after about 7 minutes walk. Keep walking and you will pass a museum on the left. Soon after that you will see a traffic light (it should be the third crosswalk you will see since leaving the palace). Cross the street to the right and keep walking, it should be a bit uphill but still lots of fashion shops and restaurants.

"Palace site is very big, it took us about half-day to explore it.

"There aren't many places in Asia where a city would sacrifice so much land in the middle of the central district to history. Seoul is a city where technology is perhaps is currently at the forefront of the world and yet they respect their rich history and display this to visitors from all over the globe. Make sure you work your time table around to see the change of guard (every two hours I think). Gwanghwamun, Heungnyemun and Gyeongbokgung are all located in the same area. One ticket will allow access to both Palaces. For those keen you can also change into Hanbok to walk around the area.

"This place is a photographer's dream. Mountains in the background. Nice clean garden, beautiful green trees and lakes and historic Korean walls and buildings and huge yards. Tourists often hire Korean traditional costumes and go here to do their best pose. Come on a weekday so less tourists and have more chance to take a shot without someone accidentally photobomb you. The nearby Folk Museum is a great way to learn about Korean history and civil culture. English audio tour available.","July 10, 2017"

"No visit to Seoul is complete without a visit to the iconic Gyeongbokgung Palace. This is the main royal palace of the 500 years old Joseon Dynasty. With a name (Gyeong-Bok) that literally means brilliance and fortune, this palace does not flatter to deceive. With an internal compound that is as grand as the Forbidden Palace in Beijing, it would take you a good 2 hours to cover all grounds within the palace. The many tourists walking the grounds dressed in traditional Korean costume (hanbok) which are rented from the nearby shops, helps create an atmosphere from the bygone Joseon Dynasty days. I only wish more of the interior rooms could be opened up to give visitors a glimpse into how the King and his royal escorts live their lives back then. Finally, don't forget to visit the 2 adjacent free museums - National Folk Museum and National Palace Museum - to complete your time travel back to the Joseon Dynasty.","June 27, 2017"

If you want to take a photo with the traditional costume - Hanbok in the Palace, you can rent at many shops outside, around the Palace ( you must ask for the price before renting). And, if you wear the Hanbok, you haven't to pay for the ticket. The Palace is large with the traditional, feature architecture and landscape design. Hope you will enjoy this place! ","June 25, 2017"
"I never went to palace before.This is my first experience and we loved it even we didn't explore palace further more because we did bring two strollers but this place definitely most go when we visit Seoul.We are in seoul right now.Summer but wind was chilling so we didnt even feel like we are in summer season.Gyeongbokgung palace also very accessible using subway ""Gyeongbokgung"".","June 25, 2017"
"Steeped in history and beauty, this massive historical complex is being tastefully restored. The free guided tours will bring this place to life as they steer you through the characters and events which makes this a first class experience. English 1030 and 1530 lasts about 70 minutes and well worth it.Beautifully illuminated at night and worth the return visit.Thanks for the vote if you found this review helpful.","June 25, 2017"

"This a beautiful palace with buildings set among picturesque gardens and lily ponds, well worth the price of admission. Also, don't miss the Folk Art museum (included in the ticket price). There were some very interesting exhibits covering many different aspects of Korean culture, traditional craftsmanship and history.","June 23, 2017"
"We spent a total of about 2 hrs walking around here. The taxi driver dropped us off at the side entrance by the culture museum so that's where we started. The whole palace here is not very big, so doesn't take very long to walk through. Since we came through the side, we weren't able to join a free tour either. So unfortunately there was not much explanation minus what was mentioned briefly on the map. I do wish they had signs or something up in each area so you're not just staring and walking blindly.There is a lot of construction going on right now so you'll see a lot of white fences up, which unfortunately blocked visiting any of the over water structures. That was a bit disappointing but understandable.If the timing works, I do recommend catching the catching of the guards performance. They don't need real guard any more these days so it's more of a show than the real stuff like at Buckingham, but was still fun to watch for 15 min. Then you can go take pictures with them.Given a lot of similar structures and building styles, I can't stop comparing this to the Forbidden City. Gyeongbokgung is just not as large or grand and therefore did not seem as impressive to me. But still worthy of a visit.","June 22, 2017"

It is hard to fathom the life the Koreans have been under, given near-continuous wars and occupations, but this palace does give the visitor a feeling of the grandeur of the country at peace.

We took the metro to Gyeongbokgung station and exited at exit 5. This will bring you to the left side entrance of the palace. The palace is huge so put on some good walking shoes to fully explore the entire compound. We arrived just in time for the changing of guards ceremony at 1100hrs which is a real highlight of our visit as we got to see the colorful and meaningful ceremony (commentary in English and mandarin is played on the PA System) explaining the ongoings. We then took some time to pose with the guards (warning no touching of their clothes or bodies when posing with them.) You will then need to buy tickets to access the inner section of the palace and pls note that washrooms are after the ticket booth somewhere in the middle section of the palace compound. We had to do a long detour back after we exited the compound. There are lot of locals and tourists in traditional hanbok dress who have purposely dressed up or rented outfits somewhere outside posing for photos throughout the palace.

"If you must visit a pavilion or palace, consider making the trip to Gyeongbokgung. Even when we visited on a rainy day, it was still worth it. The palace is humongous in proportion, and is right in front of the National Museum of Korea. I was aware that parts of Gyeongbokgung are already reconstructions from the original, but the scale is still astounding. You'll be swept away with the sights and ambiance of Korea's past dynasties. There are so many photo taking opportunities too, especially if you look around the nearby city for Hanbok rentals. If you're more into the history of the palace, there are English audio guide rentals for solo travelers and walking tours in Chinese and English. I absolutely adore this landmark and I feel like I haven't seen enough of it to truly understand its complexity. This is a must-visit! ","June 10, 2017"

Not far from the National Museum this Palace is set in very attractive gardens where the atmosphere is both clam and peaceful. Dating back over 600years it is still used today and we were told that it was the venue of a high level meeting involving major international dignitaries not too long ago.

Best time to visit is outside summer months since it's quite hot and crowded this period. Easy to get there by subway since it's located just downtown if city. After that can connect with leisure walking around the city.","June 11, 2017"
"If you must visit a pavilion or palace, consider making the trip to Gyeongbokgung. Even when we visited on a rainy day, it was still worth it. The palace is humongous in proportion, and is right in front of the National Museum of Korea. I was aware that parts of Gyeongbokgung are already reconstructions from the original, but the scale is still astounding. You'll be swept away with the sights and ambiance of Korea's past dynasties. There are so many photo taking opportunities too, especially if you look around the nearby city for Hanbok rentals. If you're more into the history of the palace, there are English audio guide rentals for solo travelers and walking tours in Chinese and English. I absolutely adore this landmark and I feel like I haven't seen enough of it to truly understand its complexity. This is a must-visit! ","June 10, 2017"
The grounds are mostly outdoors and the palace/throne rooms are even more open air. It takes a while to cover the area and I wish there was more educational value to the location. The changing of the guard ceremony was neat.,"June 10, 2017"
Not far from the National Museum this Palace is set in very attractive gardens where the atmosphere is both clam and peaceful. Dating back over 600years it is still used today and we were told that it was the venue of a high level meeting involving major international dignitaries not too long ago. The pagoda style is typically Korean and although the building itself may only be of interest for a short period of time the grounds are well worth a visit.,"June 10, 2017"

The guards at the front seem to be more a tourist attraction with their stick on beards and more a part time job than others I have seen in London etc. Don't let this put you off thou as once inside you get to see and learn about the history of Gyeongbokgung Palace. Do make sure you take the free tour lasting just over an hour will give you a good insight into its history and best of all it is free, if you dress traditionally thou it is free entry, great to see so many doing it certainly adds to the atmosphere.

If you plan to do just one palace in Seoul do this one. It's quite nice and grand. I'm general palaces in Korea and China are not as lavish as in India but it's worth a visit. Best if you go wearing a local Korean dress which you can rent just outside the palace ,"May 25, 2017"
Plenty to see here . Maybe the first thing people look at in Seoul . It gives some history and there are many shrines or temples around . Where the royal family used to live and in 1895 where the Queen was brutally murdered by the Japanese . Maybe 30 houses around and a change of guard on display at entrance . Price is cheap to gain entrance . And worth it Also you can drink tea inside one of the buildings - looks like a tea ceremony Many dressed up in traditional dress here . ,"May 25, 2017"

Like many other grand structures built by hand in other parts of the world, this palace made me feel in awe over the engineering and human effort required to erect such a building. Worth a relatively quick 1 to 2-hour visit for first-timers to Korea.","May 27, 2017"
"Historic Palace in central Seoul on all the standard tours so you won't miss out seeing it, very enjoyable","May 27, 2017"
One of the things that I look forward to when I visit the country is the overall cultural experience. A lot of countries today are so westernized and modernized that they lose the culture and what is their country is known for.But for Seoul it is intact. The palaces and its history are preserved. Must see when in South Korea!,"May 27, 2017"
"It is a beautiful place and good to learn about their cultures. You will be in best experience if you rent a hanbok from nearby store and visit around the palace, I felt like I was in Korean drama, had a lot of Instagram shots ;)","May 26, 2017"
A must if you visit Seoul! The views and the palace is heavenly. Try to go on weekday as so many people are there on weekend and hard to see the performances! ,"May 26, 2017"
We visited the Palace in the morning where there were no crowds yet. There were several buildings to walk by. We were awed by the guards ceremony. Amazing! So surreal! ,"May 26, 2017"
If you plan to do just one palace in Seoul do this one. It's quite nice and grand. I'm general palaces in Korea and China are not as lavish as in India but it's worth a visit. Best if you go wearing a local Korean dress which you can rent just outside the palace ,"May 25, 2017"
Plenty to see here . Maybe the first thing people look at in Seoul . It gives some history and there are many shrines or temples around . Where the royal family used to live and in 1895 where the Queen was brutally murdered by the Japanese . Maybe 30 houses around and a change of guard on display at entrance . Price is cheap to gain entrance . And worth it Also you can drink tea inside one of the buildings - looks like a tea ceremony Many dressed up in traditional dress here . ,"May 25, 2017"
"Sunny day to walk, lot of visitors with hanbok (Korean traditional clothes) which you can hire from 15000 won for 4 hours, you can find the shops closed by to hire the clothes, inside the palace have a lot of places for photoshoot, it's a nice day out.","May 25, 2017"
"This is definitely one place to visit. The main palace with the changing of the Guards in the morning. Changing of the Guards is a really colorful ceremony with Drums, cymbals and oriental trumpets. The palace is large but relatively new in that it was only restored in the last 150 years but rebuilt using traditional methods. here are some tips, do consider buying the Combo ticket if you are planning to visit two or more palaces. its cheaper using a combo ticket. a second tip, the combo ticket includes a visit to the secret gardens at Gyeongbuk kung. The Secret gardens are not open to the public, even with a Combo ticket. you have to reserve a place and then only be able to get in with a secret garden ticket or the combo ticket. The secret garden is quite magical . we booked about 6 days in advance. the ticket reservation opened at midnight and by the time of 8am the next day all reservations had gone. So stay up and book at midnight. :)","May 25, 2017"
"This Palace was located in a park which I would recommend going to see. The day we went was snowing and cold, but I think that only added to the atmosphere. While there were people there, the park was rather serene save for some passing tour groups. You couldn't go in the palace, understandably, but its good for a picture.","May 25, 2017"
"The palace was the main royal palace of the Joseon dynasty. Built in 1395, located in northern Seoul, South Korea.The place was very beautiful and it was mesmerizing soaking on the beauty of it. Take a slow walk and take lots of photos.","May 24, 2017"
Enjoyed the visit here since it showcases the history and beautiful culture of Korea! Must visit especially first timers! ,"May 24, 2017"
If you can try to time your arrival to see the changing of the guard by the main gate. Its easy ti forget yoh are in a busy mordern city as you spend a couple of hours exploring the buildings and gardens in the palace grounds. Its well worth getting a guide to walk you through. Lical residents dress up in traditional costume which adds colour and charm to the experience. my puctures tell a better story than what I can describe. Well worth the visit,"May 24, 2017"
"Have been to gyeongbokgung few times. This is a really nice place to visit. My family loves it a lot as you can try on hanbuk for free and takes pictures in front of the gyeongbokgung. Not sure if they still have this service now. Anyways, its a great place that highly recommended.","May 24, 2017"
"I've seen other palaces in Seoul but this one has a different beauty and character. You will imagine how grandeous of this palace in the past. You can see how the rulers lived and how they were served by their attendants. Somehow interesting. The gardens and the view of the mountain made the scenery more beautiful. It is a relaxing place to stop and reflect for a moment. You will consider the garden view as romantic, too.","May 24, 2017"
"A palace in a city. I was stayed near City Hall subway. I was walking about 10 minutes to the Palace. If you are wearing Hanbok located outside the Palace (nearby shop houses, the rental price usually KRW 10,000 for 2 hours), then the entrance fee to the Palace would be waived, or else per pax for adult would be KRW 3,000 as listed on Korea Tourism website. However, I bought 3 adult ticket at KRW 4,500 on Sunday, which I don't know the reason why cheaper. There were some flea market stalls located all along the way to GwangHuaMen (I guess only available on Sunday).","May 24, 2017"
"Basically a palace with an admission fee. If you're not fond of historic places, you may explore other areas. This is a walking distance from Gwanghwamun Square as well.","May 24, 2017"
"Large palace that requires several hours to walk around the grounds and see the different buildings.Interesting to see the ancient palace grounds and gain some insight into Korean history. The grounds are well-maintained and clean. Can be crowded at times. When we went they had some sections of the palace sectioned off for renovation/restoration.Somewhat disappointing in that it seems the vast majority of the palace structures were all recreations. Personally, I would prefer to have the actual historical structures, but just roped/sectioned off to prevent damage from tourists.Regardless, we're glad to have visited the palace and thinks it's worthwhile to go when in Seoul.","May 23, 2017"

"In terms of ""Palace Grounds"", I think this is the most beautiful.I have read reviews that this place is nothing special and that there are many people walking around. Simply not true, well, the ""not special"" part anyway.There will be lots of people walking around, its a main attraction when visiting Seoul so I'm not sure what why you would not expect this.This place is great for photography. So many different types of plants and flowers and lots of buildings to walk around and explore.Yo will see many people walking around in ""Hanbok"" which is a traditional dress of Korea. Colourful and beautiful imo.Grab a leaflet at the start which includes a map, its free and will ensure that you don't miss anything. There is also a way to see the ""Blue House"" which is where the president resides. I missed this first time round.Entrance is cheap and you can buy a drink and some snacks inside.

OF course it is the biggest one, time is running fast, you can easily spend 4-5 hours here and at the same time you'll have a feeling that it was 40-50 minutes... strange, really!","May 15, 2017"
"there were many people, but not much explanation about the buildings on the site. it might be nice for a picnic for family, but too much walking to see buildings which are not given any explanation in any language.","May 15, 2017"
"Entry into the palace is free when you walk in wearing a hanbok, which was what I did! I rented a hanbok from the nearby Bukchon Hanok Village. It costs 15,000 KRW for a 2 hour rental. It was very fun soaking in the history of the place, walking around in the hanbok and taking many photos! However, there were very few write-ups of the different spots in the palace so most of the time I actually didn't know what I was looking at. Most of the palace is also rather empty and there are many places where entry is denied and you can only look at the building from afar. ","May 14, 2017"

"The very first time for us to be here in South Korea and it such a great experience for us and we are having fun and wonderful city tour. Our tour guide was Mia, such an ideal tour guide who was very energetic, friendjy and knowledgeable. Almost all she recommended about food to eat and to have/buy when we are in Korea were followed. Hope and pray, i could come back in different season and i want to go to Jeju Island on my next visit!","May 16, 2017"
"In terms of ""Palace Grounds"", I think this is the most beautiful.I have read reviews that this place is nothing special and that there are many people walking around. Simply not true, well, the ""not special"" part anyway.There will be lots of people walking around, its a main attraction when visiting Seoul so I'm not sure what why you would not expect this.This place is great for photography. So many different types of plants and flowers and lots of buildings to walk around and explore.Yo will see many people walking around in ""Hanbok"" which is a traditional dress of Korea. Colourful and beautiful imo.Grab a leaflet at the start which includes a map, its free and will ensure that you don't miss anything. There is also a way to see the ""Blue House"" which is where the president resides. I missed this first time round.Entrance is cheap and you can buy a drink and some snacks inside. I recommend taking a packed lunch, find a nice spot in the grounds and relax.The changing of the guard is a must see.A great day out for all.","May 16, 2017"

"The Gyeongbokgung Palace is quite impressive. The area behind the (restored) front gate is public and you're able to watch the very nice Royal Guard Changing Ceremony even for free.If you wanna enter the actual Palace ground it'll cost you the small entrance fee of about 3$ only. Sure worth it.The palace ground is quite big and impressive. Nice buildings and architecture. Lots of green areas as well. Many visitors are roaming the area in (mostly rented) Hanboks. A nice sight. Like I said, don't miss out on the guard changing ceremony. The Royal Guards change at least at 2pm and 5pm. Before the ceremony you can watch them train, just outside the walls (eastside). We went on a weekday and got some good spots to watch, not many visitors. It's enough if you show up about 15-20mins before (at least in spring). You also can take some nice pics together with the guards just outside the main gate.All in all a nice place to visit. A few minutes away only from the Bukchon Hanok Village, don't miss out on that one if you're in the area.Wanna know more about me and my trips? Check my profile.","May 14, 2017"

"We went to see the palace and a special ""rehearsal"" for a huge ceremony. Very interesting! Lots of people, lots of music, lots of heat. The rehearsal went on for over 2 hours starting around 11 am on Sunday. They worked on tiny parts of the ceremony over and over, yet missed glaring errors. However, it was very interesting to watch this changing ceremony, hear the very unique music. Costumes were incredibly elaborate. Don't know if this is a normal rehearsal done frequently, or only occasionally. It was not the normal changing of the guard After the heat became too intense, we went into the Museum It was free but there is not much there. They don't seem to have much historical memorabilia but they do have 2 very cool vintage autos in the atrium which seem like the center for all attractions. Only spent about 1 hr in the museum and that was more than enough time to cool off and sit for awhile.","May 13, 2017"

You can then add accessories to your outfit but getting your hair braided and adding a traditional headband and pick out a handbag of your choice.

"Was there to visit the palace in Apr 2017. Location is central u can take a subway to the station named after it and a short walk will take u to main gate. It happened to be I think royal culture week so many Koreans dressed in traditional hangbok so it was quite a sight. Entrance fee is not expensive only around 1500 won I think. I rented a audio guide in English but on hindsight I would suggest to take the free English guided tour at specific intervals daily. As the audio guide was cumbersome to use and info was a bit of overkill. But it gives some background on the palace which was central piece of Korean culture. The place was definitely much smaller than Beijing forbidden city which I feel is a much better tourist experience. Probably because most of buildings were burnt down during jap occupation and the rebuilt ones had spartan deco within. And there wasn't much exhibition on ancient palace exhibits unlike the forbidden city. Hence my average rating. But if u haven't been to china, I guess it's still a good way to spend 2-3 hours of your time understanding the Korean history and the royal family. ","May 9, 2017"

"This Palace is located in a super central area of Seoul. I went for the changing of the guard and spent about an hour walking around. Its not as impressive as say the forbidden city in Beijing but its beautiful and i love how locals and some visitors dress up in the old style outfits and walk around the palace. Its something quite interesting to see. Its walking distance then to Insa-dong and also the area street. Def must visit and if time is short, you really can get around this in under an hour.

"This is one of the big attractions in Seoul, but I felt there is so much to do in the city and this just isn't a top memory. The palace and the grounds are basically a reconstruction because of various wars. I know it's not their fault, but it makes it less interesting to me. It is pretty, but many of the buildings just feel like the same thing over and over. You're probably going to see it, but with such a wonderful city, I would recommend seeing more of modern Seoul.","May 2, 2017"
We were welcomed by a teen guide working on her English skills. She was amazing and knew lots of details about the history of the palace. She explained that she did the tours once a month for school credit. The changing of the guard is a colourful must see. The only disappointment was that all you get to see are empty buildings. There are a few sticks of furniture - such as a replica throne and bed frame but not much else.,"May 2, 2017"

With a map/short guide available, one can go around on their own, but would advise to take a guided tour since they offer it free anyway.

"My wife and I went to Seoul so I could visit sites and locations from serving there many years ago in the military. We like the luxury of Four Seasons hotels but like the location of the Seoul Four Seasons as it was central to the locations I wanted to visit. My contacts with the staff started long before we arrived. I email the Concierge in relation to the locations I wanted to visit and how to best coordinate my travels. In a few emails we had complete a plan which included all sites within our limited time. The Concierge team is excellent. They continued to guide us after we arrived.When we checked in we soon learn this excellence extended though the entire staff from the escort to our room, dining staff, everyone. We felt very much at home and comfortable. We had a premiere room with a great view of modern Seoul. The room was very spacious, clean, modern and well equipped for any traveler. The first evening we ate a late dinner at the hotel. Great service and great food, a sampling of Korean dished. Each morning we ate at the breakfast buffet. We managed to eat light but walking and viewing all the culinary offerings is a tour in its self.An excellent exhibit of historic Korean royal architecture. Visit in the mornings around 10:00 am entering at the South Gate to catch the changing of the royal guards. Note the building techniques, colors and layout to the palace buildings. At extensive as these palace grounds are the represent only about 14% of the original structures.Make it a point to exit through the North Gate. The building straight head is the Presidential Blue house (named for its blue title roof). Korea’s equivalent to the White House.","April 24, 2017"
"This is one of the old palace in Seoul.You will definitely love this place if you are a fan of Korean drama, you can find many familiar corners where movies were filmed.

"The architecture of the buildings are nice and too many Koreans wearing hanbok the Korean costume, so it gives you feeling of tradition and culture of Korea while you are there. The palace has many buildings and there are national folk museum and national palace museum also so you visit them all together and you will have very good Korean cultural experience. Don't miss the changing of the guards during your visit we watched them at 2:00 pm but i think they have another changing show at 11:00 am. You can join your visit with Insandong area which it is very near about 10-15 minutes walking and one stop by metro. ","April 24, 2017"

I've been to other palaces in Asia that has more information . This was just little halls after halls with no information and any cultural history. The architecture of the buildings are nice .

"Had part of a morning spare in Seoul so went for a short walk and tumbled upon this palace, dating back to 1395. It sits juxtaposed against mirrored glass modern buildings but the serenity within its walls holds the modern world at bay. The outer walls are long and impressive but they nevertheless still hide the scale of what lies behind. One can but only imagine life within the cloistered palace walls and its inner and outer courts, gardens and lake. After reading about the destruction of the palace by fire during the Japanese invasion in 1592 and the taking apart by the Japanese of the reconstructed buildings during their occupation between 1910 - 1945, one must admire the Korean spirit and skill in ensuring such a faithful restoration of the Heungnyemun Gate, the Gwanghwamun Gate and the various royal and princely quarters. Walking through the palace grounds while there were so many locals wearing traditional costume/clothing during their own visits made it easier to imagine the daily bustle of a bygone era.An interesting place to visit.","April 24, 2017"

The visitors, being winter, were fewer, and so we're able to take beautiful photos. Also, the district where Gyeokbokgung Palace is located is my favorite. It's like the history and art district of Seoul. There were art museums, even the contemporary ones. Also it's near Bukchon Hanok Village. I really want to visit again and take more photos.

"Gyeongbokgung Palace was amazing. We got there just in time for the changing of the guard, which was much cooler than I expected. The throne room was the most impressive thing I saw in the entire country. A must visit if you're in Seoul. ","April 5, 2017"
It was a pleasant experience. We even got to see the changing of the guards. Cons is only when we visited there are a lot of tourists as well so the place was too crowded and its hard to get solo pictures. ,"April 5, 2017"
"Besides the magnificent structures and design of the entire Gyeongbokgung Palace and grounds, what really attracts people here is the changing of the royal guards procession that takes places everyday at 9.30am til 11am. Although they are not exactly real royal guards (like in Stockholm and London), the procession is very realistic and depicts very accurately the manner the changing of the royal guards would have been back in the days where South Korea was still ruled by a monarchy. Charges to enter the palace grounds are relatively affordable (compared to other palaces around the world) at KRW3000/adult and KRW1500/person 7-12 years. children below 6 years enters free. This is consistent with the fares charged at other royal palaces in Seoul. If you are a history buff, you would enjoy the walk-around and tour of the Gyeongbokgung palace as it is the other palace aside from Changdeokgung that has a very rich history behind it. Strongly recommend it if you want to learn more about the history of south Korea during the Joseon dynasty and if you admire the beautiful designs of traditional Korean buildings and structures. The palace opens at 9am to 6pm (depends on different seasons) so if you would like go during less crowded times, try to go in at 9am or towards the late evening to avoid the busloads of group tourists.

There are many displays with information in a few languages, including English, so you can get a good idea of the history.","April 5, 2017"
"Gyeongbokgung Palace was amazing. We got there just in time for the changing of the guard, which was much cooler than I expected. The throne room was the most impressive thing I saw in the entire country. A must visit if you're in Seoul. ","April 5, 2017"
It was a pleasant experience. We even got to see the changing of the guards. Cons is only when we visited there are a lot of tourists as well so the place was too crowded and its hard to get solo pictures. ,"April 5, 2017"
"Besides the magnificent structures and design of the entire Gyeongbokgung Palace and grounds, what really attracts people here is the changing of the royal guards procession that takes places everyday at 9.30am til 11am. Although they are not exactly real royal guards (like in Stockholm and London), the procession is very realistic and depicts very accurately the manner the changing of the royal guards would have been back in the days where South Korea was still ruled by a monarchy. Charges to enter the palace grounds are relatively affordable (compared to other palaces around the world) at KRW3000/adult and KRW1500/person 7-12 years. children below 6 years enters free. This is consistent with the fares charged at other royal palaces in Seoul. If you are a history buff, you would enjoy the walk-around and tour of the Gyeongbokgung palace as it is the other palace aside from Changdeokgung that has a very rich history behind it. Strongly recommend it if you want to learn more about the history of south Korea during the Joseon dynasty and if you admire the beautiful designs of traditional Korean buildings and structures. The palace opens at 9am to 6pm (depends on different seasons) so if you would like go during less crowded times, try to go in at 9am or towards the late evening to avoid the busloads of group tourists.

Beautiful big palace with many sections that have been well preserved. Be well prepared with good walking shoes.

The main gate, the courtyard and the main palace building awed me. The beautiful pavillion at the back was so serene. Considering the relatively cheap ticket price and the whole experience, it was totally worth it.","March 24, 2017"
Such a beautiful location. We learnt a lot about the history of Korean royals. Would highly recommend taking the walking tour.,"March 24, 2017"
"Just like the other palace, you will see older building and not too many surprise ! But it is very good culture learning and beautiful gardening . We were there a bit too early , the weather is very cold. Suggest visit Korea after March .","March 24, 2017"
"In Seoul city there are near about four Kings Palace. Among them the Gyeongbokgung Palace is the most important, centrally located and covers a larger area. The heritage palace is nicely maintained and depicts the Korean history from the 15TH TO 18TH Century. Please visit the palace prior to 4 pm otherise you cant by ticket to enter inside the palace","March 24, 2017"
Went here in the morning to catch changing of royal guard ceremony.Lots of tourist at this time. This palace is big so you need to allot more time to look around. Wear comfy shoes & prepare yourself for a walkathon,"March 26, 2017"
I was planning to join a half-day tour of the palace but realized the hop-on-hop-off bus stopped not far from it. Go in the morning to avoid the crowds. Don't miss the changing of the guards. It's a nice recreation. The grounds are pleasant to walk around. But there were too many tourists dressed in the Korean national outfits. A bit too cheesy for me. ,"March 26, 2017"
I recommend to visit the palace when you are wearing old korean cloth and take a photo graph. the photograph will be one of your favorite.,"March 26, 2017"
"Sprawling area with huge gates, stairs, separate zones for the military and the illiterate. Statues that depict some humour can be found in the compound. Heated floors have also been thought of to keep the King and his family and staff warm. A historical site, good to spend some time. Best use a guided tour or the audio guide to gain more insights. Worth the visit but need to wear good walking shoes as the grounds are massive. ","March 25, 2017"
"Gyeongbokgun palace is definitely a place to learn and feel Korean history and culture. Guide was explaining very good, in detail. I wish I had more time there","March 25, 2017"
Unfortunately most of what is original to Korea has had to be rebuilt. The lack of authenticity was excused when so many of the tourists visitinnworebtradional clothing. It is an interesting walkin museum,"March 25, 2017"

Gyeongbokgung Palace is a wonderful place to visit and a must when in Seoul. Truly magnificent. The view is spectacular and one should try to put on the traditional garb and enjoy relieving Korea's glorious past.,"March 24, 2017"
"Let me tell you first, that the entrance fee to this place is only 3,000 krw (less than $3). This is incredibly cheap, considering how vast and large this place is. Also, if you rent and wear a hanbok from any hanbok rental shop near the palace, your entrance fee is FREE.I really recommend going here with a tour guide because it's really incredible listening to the history behind each building and architectural element, starting from the ondol floor heating technology dating back to the Joseon era, to the different symbolisms embedded into the walls, floors, and roofs of the palace. Much of the palace was destroyed by the Japanese forces during the Japanese occupation, and some buildings have still not been restored. You can also visit the residence and deathplace of Queen Myeongseong, who was assassinated by the Japanese in the 1900s.I would say Gyeongbokgung takes a good 2 hours to fully look around. But definitely, Gyeongbokgung is a must-visit for any travelers wanting to experience the history of Korea.","March 24, 2017"
"I'm a Kdrama fan and finally traveled to South Korea with the hopes of visiting significant places that are always shown in a drama. I don't know why but I'm into Saguek kind of drama with Kings (Wang) and Crown Princes (Seja) as the main characters. That is why my first stop is the Gyeongbukgong palace. I was imagining as i was there how the entourage of the king of about 20 or almost, would follow him wherever he goes and when he talks to any of his concubines let's say outside of their quarters, those entourage will look the other way and pretend not to hear anything. Although the palace was flocked by tourists everyday, i'm glad i was able to see it and its beautiful garden. I went there last autumn season and the trees were very colorful, needless to say, a sight for sore eyes. Just take the subway in going there. You can go down Gyeongbukgong station, which is the nearest to the palace or go down Gwangwamun station and see first Statues of King Sejong and admiral Yi in Gwangwamun square then head straight to the gates of Gwangwamun then the palace itself. The famous Cheonggyecheon stream is also nearby. Since i was traveling solo, selfies overload was what happened. Anyways i enjoyed every minute of it. Turns out it wasn't boring traveling solo afterall.","March 23, 2017"
"The highlight of my visit to Gyeongbokgung Palace is the Changing of the Guards ceremony. Make sure to schedule your visit or watch out for the actual changing of the guards schedule while you are the the vicinity of the palace. It is an experience that you will not regret! You may even take a picture or a video while the ceremony is taking place. Walking distance from the Gwanghwamun Square. Don't miss this on your trip to Seoul, South Korea!","March 23, 2017"
Tour guide did a good job showing my friends around. Good time management and good explanation. Were really having a good time and will totally bring my friend here again. Winter time is the best to visit such place.,"March 23, 2017"
"This place is accessible via subway (Gyeongbokgung Station) and follow the signs for the exits.There is an open area for you to take pictures at the main entrance if you just want a keep sake with some of the palace architecture in the background. However, if it is you first time, I would recommend paying a small fee to enter to see the entire palace ground at least once. This place is huge so be prepared to walk around a lot. But every corner was mesmerising. Especially if you're into those period dramas - you could picture what it was like in those days because some of the buildings have actual furniture (chairs, beds, vases, books, shelves etc.) so you get to see what the rooms might have looked like in the past. There is security around so it is pretty safe. If you're going in the day, bring your sunglasses because this place has lots of bare sandy ground and can get quite bright. Lots of photo ops and you can rent hanboks nearby to really blend in and get into the period atmosphere if you'd like. If you'd like a shot without too many tourists in the picture, there are many secluded spots towards the back of the palace. They have guided tours too that will help you to learn more about the history. In all, I would recommend to visit this place at least once. ","March 23, 2017"
"My wife and I decided to visit the Gyeongbokgung Palace yesterday morning to acquaint ourselves with some culture and history of this vibrant nation of South Korea.We took a cab there for convenience instead of going by subway.We went there early at 9.30am because we wanted to witness the Ceremony of Gate Guard Change. This is held twice everyday at 10am and 2pm except on Tuesday when the palace is closed. The guards in full ancient soldier attire will march into the royal courtyard to the accompaniment of a marching band comprising, drums, trumpets and cymbals. It's quite spectacular to watch . This was the highlight of our tour . As for the palace tour , it is not as grand as what I have seen in China by comparison. There is an entry fee of 3,000 won per person and seniors above 65 enter free of charge .

For me, I've been there like 4 times and I've already know how the palace looks like, so I just walk around Gwanghwamun without paying a cent to enter the palace.

I definitely recommend visiting the palace wearing a hanbok. It adds quite an authentic look to your photos! Join the free tour which starts at the information center near the main gate. But join the earlier schedule so you won't be rushed in the afternoon as they close on time. The guards were shooing us away as we were still taking photos. We had to keep on running and stop for a bit to continue taking photos when the guards were busy shooing other visitors!

"This is a don't miss experience for any tourist in Seoul. The palace grounds are extensive and the thing to be sure you don't miss is the changing of the guard ceremony, which occurs several times during the day. It's bright and colorful and occurs just outside the gate between the palace walls and the bus parking on the east side. You can hear the drums from anywhere inside, but they do block the entrance for awhile as the guard passes....the best photo spot in between the parade grounds and the bus park. There's not a whole lot else to do inside the palace but do walk it and get a feeling for the grandeur of times past.","March 21, 2017"

"Originally built in 1395, this complex was the seat of the Joseon Dynasty until destroyed by the Japanese in the 1590’s. Instead of rebuilding, the royal family moved to another palace site. In 1867-68, the Prince Regent sponsored a reconstruction. Unfortunately, it again was almost totally destroyed during the second Japanese occupation prior to World War II, and the events of the Korean War. Restoration work began again in 1989, but according to our guide, only about 50% of the buildings have been completed. Nonetheless it is a fascinating place to visit and easily accessible. Inevitably, one will compare it to The Forbidden City because of similar design, but on a smaller scale. Make sure that you see Gyeonghoeru Pavilion (on the lake), one of the structures that dates from the 1867 restoration. It was used for entertainment when important foreign visitors visited the palace. Another point of interest is the video that deals with the assassination of Empress Myeongseong by Japanese agents in 1895 (and her quarters). One thing that added charm to our visit was the large number of young folks wearing traditional dress. Evidently, the clothes are available for rental and this has become a “thing to do” on a date, or just a lark.","March 20, 2017"

"There's a metro station just beside the palace so it's very easy to go to. On the front gate, you may take your pictures with the royal palace guards. And every hour, there's a performance where the guards change their duty shift. Apparently, there's a little ceremony for that!Once the performance is done (roughly after ten minutes), the application for the use of guards costume opens. But you have to very quick because they only accommodate max of 10 pax per time slot. We were just lucky enough to be included!!! You may choose from the 4 costumes you want to try. Once you're on it, you can only wander along the ground but not too far! So it's just good for taking pictures. :)Entrance to the palace is 3000 won for adults.

If you are limited for time then of the main tourists sites this would be my recommendation for the one to do. Located within easy walking distance of City Hall the palace is a juxtaposition of the surrounding modern buildings. Very relaxing to take a stroll around the grounds and when we visited in early afternoon the reflections of some of the buildings on the water were stunning. It is also worthwhile taking in the National Palace Museum which is located near the main entrance and is free to enter after you have paid your initial entrance fee of KRW3K. Great value for money and a wonderful place to great away from the hubris of the City and see the locals ( and some foreigners) dressing up in local costumes. ,"March 16, 2017"
"A beautiful historic site. Similar in layout to Forbidden City in Beijing but on a smaller scale. Beautifully restored and maintained buildings. This site must not be missed on any visit to Seoul.

"Every time I've been to Seoul on business trip, I go to visit Gyeongbokgung Palace with different people from my countries. We usually have no tourist guide and our people are not good at English as well as Korean so I have to introduce them about this palace by myself. The more I visit this palace, the more I feel how great it is. Even it was burnt down once but Korean people rebuilt and re-act all the activity so people can understand what happened there several hundred years ago. It's also very good place to take a walk then you can enjoy very nice food so called Samgyetang at a very famous restaurant nearby.It's really nice place for visiting at any time of the year.","March 16, 2017"
"The place itself was amazing! it's combined with nature and a very exquisite design..it was a great place to take pictures and to go if you're wearing hanbok. yes, i was there and wore hanbok.

You should try!..if you're into the architecture and design, this place is for you. but I guess they're trying to build up the new building when was there.","March 15, 2017"
This used to be the main palace but many of the original buildings were burnt down. Nothing much to see except the pond and the little pavilion here. You can either purchase a single ticket for this palace or a combined ticket for all 4 palaces. All the palaces are connected. A secret garden is a must to see. ,"March 15, 2017"
"The palace was very designed and harmonised with the beauty of the surrounding nature. You could appreciate the creativity of the designers of the palace. At the end of the tour, I was most touched by the sad story of the Queen who was assassinated by the Japanese soldiers. Visitors are allowed to watch a video of the story, visit her rooms and imagine the atrocities happened in the past. Highly recommended.","March 15, 2017"

"Here is the large palace and it is big enough, there are the lake, garden, trees and the location is in city.We can go here using public transportation such us train, bus or taxi","March 18, 2017"
Nicely maintained and serene atmosphere. People who have visited many indian palaces would find it too plain .. but worth the short time it takes to complete the same. enjoy,"March 17, 2017"
If you are limited for time then of the main tourists sites this would be my recommendation for the one to do. Located within easy walking distance of City Hall the palace is a juxtaposition of the surrounding modern buildings. Very relaxing to take a stroll around the grounds and when we visited in early afternoon the reflections of some of the buildings on the water were stunning. It is also worthwhile taking in the National Palace Museum which is located near the main entrance and is free to enter after you have paid your initial entrance fee of KRW3K. Great value for money and a wonderful place to great away from the hubris of the City and see the locals ( and some foreigners) dressing up in local costumes. ,"March 16, 2017"
"A beautiful historic site. Similar in layout to Forbidden City in Beijing but on a smaller scale. Beautifully restored and maintained buildings. This site must not be missed on any visit to Seoul. Not suitable for mobility challenged as considerable walking is required and some stairs. Folk museum is on site with excellent exhibits, gift shop and washrooms. ","March 16, 2017"
"Every time I've been to Seoul on business trip, I go to visit Gyeongbokgung Palace with different people from my countries. We usually have no tourist guide and our people are not good at English as well as Korean so I have to introduce them about this palace by myself. The more I visit this palace, the more I feel how great it is. Even it was burnt down once but Korean people rebuilt and re-act all the activity so people can understand what happened there several hundred years ago. It's also very good place to take a walk then you can enjoy very nice food so called Samgyetang at a very famous restaurant nearby.It's really nice place for visiting at any time of the year.","March 16, 2017"
"The place itself was amazing! it's combined with nature and a very exquisite design..it was a great place to take pictures and to go if you're wearing hanbok. yes, i was there and wore hanbok. The pictures and the traditional place was a match made in heaven! You should try!..if you're into the architecture and design, this place is for you. but I guess they're trying to build up the new building when was there.","March 15, 2017"
This used to be the main palace but many of the original buildings were burnt down. Nothing much to see except the pond and the little pavilion here. You can either purchase a single ticket for this palace or a combined ticket for all 4 palaces. All the palaces are connected. A secret garden is a must to see. ,"March 15, 2017"
"The palace was very designed and harmonised with the beauty of the surrounding nature. You could appreciate the creativity of the designers of the palace. At the end of the tour, I was most touched by the sad story of the Queen who was assassinated by the Japanese soldiers. Visitors are allowed to watch a video of the story, visit her rooms and imagine the atrocities happened in the past. Highly recommended.","March 15, 2017"
"This place is on a defifnite must-do list if it's your first time to Seoul! Filled with so much culture and history, you need to come here! Beautiful in the fall and the spring (but I also went in the summer and sweated and still had fun), it's a must-do in Seoul. ","March 14, 2017"

"Living in the Seoul area, I have visited Gyeongbokgung Palace many times with friends and family. It is BIG and accommodates all the visitors it receives from schools, tour groups, and explorers like me quite easily. There are so many things to photograph including the guard changing ceremonies at the gate and the procession that takes place in the large square. Although I have been here several times, I find that I am discovering sights I overlooked the first time, which makes it interesting for me when I accompany first time visitors. For extra fun, consider renting traditional Korean clothing to wear as you tour, because being in a historical location wearing historical clothing makes your photos even better! There is a small admission fee and you need to make sure the palace is open the day you go (it is closed on Tuesdays and the hours of operation vary by season). If you enjoy historic sights, interesting architecture, and beautiful scenery and if you don't mind walking (wear good shoes), this is one of the places to go in Seoul. Fans of historical Korean dramas should not miss Gyeongbokgung Palace!","March 13, 2017"
"Lovely place to visit. Shame the original palace was destroyed.But great that koreans are rebuilding it (as best as possible) to preserve their history.

Don't miss the changing of the guards ceremony at the main gate entrance at 10 am- 4 PM hourly. Highly recommend the free guided English tour offered daily at 11 AM, gives you insight into different aspects of the architecture and culture. The Korean Folk Museum inside was very neat if you are interested in Korean history and the the different Monarch's. Autumn was lovely time to visit. The palace grounds are so nicely maintained and very safe. I was there at the end of November and it was comfortable in layers during the day. Palaces close at 5 so dress warmly if you plan to be out and about in the evening. ","February 24, 2017"
"Out of all the places I visited on my 6-day trip to Seoul, this is my favorite. Went there during winter and it was amazing. Wasn't able to cover the whole palace during my 2-hour visit. Would visit again if I come back to Seoul.","February 23, 2017"

"Gyungbok palace is one of the MUST visit places if you want to have a tour in Seoul. if you compare with forbiden city in Peiking, feeling is very different with that one. It will be interesting to compare two different palace. Walking along the main building to the backside ponds with Queen's place, you can feel from the enormous authority to the relaxed calmness.Good fun with Korean traditional cloth,Hanbok, you can have free pass if you rent a cloth and enter the palce wearing Hanbok. This will give you much fun with good memorial photo.As Korea has 4 distintive seasons, different seasonal visiting will provide you totally different feeling as well.","February 22, 2017"

"I visited this palace twice, once in the summer and another during winter and I can say that both experiences were amazing, since the scenery of lakes and trees makes the place very different. My only advice is during winter wear warm clothes with layers, protect your hands and head and enjoy the tranquility of this place.There is a change of guard at 10:00am every day with narration so the visitors will understand what the ceremony is about. Arrive a few minutes early to get a good spot to see it. There are other times during the day, check in the website. I bought the ticket next to the main gate and I also got the booklet with information. There are tours in several languages but I did not want to wait for the English tour that would start at 11:00am and just wondered on my own. It is very busy but don't get intimidated with the crowds. If you start the tour from from the back, you miss all the tours and have a lot of peace and quiet. I just wandered for 2 hours, contemplating, taking pictures and watching people. Some girls rent the Korean dress called hanbok to enter the palaces for free and it's nice to see them walking about in the palace it makes you wonder what life must be like in the old days. You also can use your ticket to enter the National Folk Museum of Korea.","February 20, 2017"

My daughter and I decided to visit the palace. I am so glad we did. The palace is so beautiful and we spent about an hour and a half waking around.It was freezing cold and it was nice to be able to grab a coffee during the walk.We also stopped to have traditional tea.It is well worth the visit. And a cab fare is really cheap if you take an orange cab. The black cabs are more expensive.,"February 8, 2017"
"in spite of the cold we visited the palace and walked around these beautiful grounds as much as possible. It's a must-see, especially if you should be lucky enough to see the changing of the palace guard. We weren't able to - cancelled due to the snow, however, they were standing at the front gate entrance. Very colorful and fierce looking guys who didn't mind having their photos taken.The palace was built in 1395 and was the main royal palace of the Joseon dynasty and destroyed by fire during the Imjin War (Japanese invasion - 1592-8) and abandoned for two centuries. Mount Bugak is the backdrop and if you want to have a lovely view of the entire grounds, walk over to the National Museum and take the elevator to the (? can't remember; might be the 8th floor or higher?) where there is a terrace that provides a marvelous view.","February 8, 2017"
"The palace is great culture, good for pictures, and offers free English tours. The place is huge, and near other attractions, so I recommend planning your day around it.","February 8, 2017"
"We went in November. A bit chilly out but no queues and less tourists. Well preserved old palace with traditional guards in Korean dress. Changing of the guard ceremony was beautiful. Earlier in the day was nice as we were largely alone. If it is rainy day I would not recommend as there is very little in the way of shelter. Even in winter, the gardens were beautiful! In a truly busy metropolis, this was 2 hours of less noise and a hold onto Korea's past which is not always evident with the rush to modernity!","February 7, 2017"
"This was one of our very first stops upon arrival in South Korea. I would definitely suggest going in springtime, when the cherry blossoms are in bloom, and hopefully the lotus flowers in the pond are blooming too. You could easily spend half a day to a full day to see each and every piece of this area. We got some great photos, and definitely plan to head back again before our couple of years here are done!","February 6, 2017"
Walking through Gyeongbokgung Palace was an amazing experience. All of the buildings are beautiful and full of rich history. Free tours run every few minutes in various languages. Our tour guide was extremely knowledgeable and kind!,"February 6, 2017"
"A must go place!You may find it is a good to place to go in different seasons, go with a big group or good to go alone! A place where you can sit to enjoy the scenery, take pictures and to find out more the Korean Royal life.Go connection with Metro!","February 6, 2017"
"Don't miss this if you are visiting Seoul. The guard changing ceremonies are the highlight and performing daily in short and long sessions. Do at least stay for the short one if your schedule allowed. There are also free guided tours available in different languages. Head to the right from the main gate for the information center once you purchase the entrance ticket. The staff was very helpful! The palace was indeed amazing in winter. Many girls - tourists and locals alike dressed up in hanbok. It was such a beautiful scene. I've been to Seoul countless times but this was the first to the palace. I would totally come back again the next time to learn more about its history, and hopefully the weather won't be too cold so I can dress up in hanbok to take a stroll in the palace.","February 5, 2017"
"being over 65 years old we were very surprised that we did not have to pay for the entrance fee as seniors.Place was very grand , very inteersting and worth seeing ","February 5, 2017"
"One of the best places for pictures! Lots of walking though and there's really only a few spectacular places. One is the pond in back the the small pagoda and the other is behind and to the left of the main throne room- it's a huge dinner hall in a rectangular pond. Find these and a few others and you're good. Otherwise it can get exhausting. Beautiful in winter, too. ","February 4, 2017"
"We spent an hour to get to 'Jongro-3road' station, because we wanted to go to ""Gyeongbokgung"". Before we go inside of it, we could see a large door called ""Gwanghwamun"". We could see quite a lot of people wearing ""Hanbok"" when we get through the gate. The palace was absolutely astonishing. We couldn't see the end because it's vast compound. Also when we looked inside of the Hanok(Korean traditional house), we could see beautiful colored ceiling. We could feel that this palace is the history of the place. It was almost hard to take in. We felt overwhelming. Also there is a wonderful lake. This lake was surrounded by large trees. In the middle of the lake there is a small island. We were honestly, completely blown away by this. Because we saw this place, we become aware of the sheer wealth and power of the Joseon dynasty. Absolutely incredible place. I highly recommend to visit here. Visiting this place is just the same with seeing a little piece of a picture in the past. Tip : It spends more than 3 hours to look this palace. Also even if you are foreigner, you can go inside the palace for free if you wear a Korean traditional clothes. You can rent it $20. You can get a great picture with it.","February 3, 2017"
We were there the same date as the korean celebrate lunar new year hence the new year decoration. Had lots of fun taking photos and most importantly we got to wear on Korean traditional clothes for photo shooting and it was for free!,"February 3, 2017"
"The highlight was the changing of the guards, which was colourful. I loved the mountains in th backdrop.","February 3, 2017"
"This is the second time here. A lot of tourists as usual, but well manicured. Quite big, takes an hour or two to walk the whole palace. Must see if you haven't already, but probably not more than once.","February 2, 2017"

Very convenient to travel to Gyeongbokgung Palace. Is just outside a metro station. Interesting palace to visit. Totally recommend for family who are bringing elderly. A slow stroll and a place to see their Korean palace culture. ,"January 31, 2017"
"It's large, impressive and historial. But a bit boring in the winter. Most of the courtyards are mud and wet after the snow. Very crowded with Chinese tour groups during the Chinese New Year holiday. Most of the buildings you don't enter and you just look in through the door or window. Might be more interesting with a tour group. Overall worth seeing if you have some time to fill since it's only 3k won for the general entry. But I wouldn't consider it a ""must see""","January 31, 2017"
"Truly beautiful. Bit of a hike to get around and see everything there, but on a nice pleasant Seoul day well worth the extra steps. Interesting architecture and would recommend taking the time to just take a step back and take it in. A guide would be somewhat helpful, but a good tour guide book can be nearly as accommodating.","January 31, 2017"
We went here during winter but it was still busy! We bought tickets on arrival then decided to hire some Hanbok (traditional Korean dresses) which were all located outside the palace on the main roads. We didn't know that if you are wearing traditional clothes you get to enter the palace for free! The ticket lady at the door told us to go get a refund for our tickets. It was simply amazing! All the intricate little details of the design was mesmerizing! Definitely a must see!,"January 31, 2017"
"Had a short walk in the compounds before coming out as my aged father could not walk much. That said, the trees were barren and I think it would definitely be much nicer during spring and autumn.

"i've been to this palace three times already, and don't get sick of it. it's beautiful, and it's worth to read a little bit about it before, so you can understand it better. highly recommended.","January 29, 2017"
"I love palaces and castles. I enjoy history so I like such palaces. But my brother thinks they are all the same and boring. So, to each his own. This is the biggest palace, so it's a must-see. But it's a nice place for photos, get a feel of Korean culture. Fun to see many people walking around in Korean hanbok clothes too. Feel like they came from another age into the modern world. There's guided tours provided in various languages. Be sure to check which one you want to join from the website timing before you go, so you can plan your day better. Wait at the front of the information office for the tour. I would suggest going for the tour so you can get more structured information about the palace. The national folk museum and palace museum are on the same grounds. Both are free but the palace is not. If you enjoy palaces, buy the combination ticket as its 4 palaces + 1 shrine (total ₩14000) but with the combi ticket it costs only ₩10000. Value for money if you will visit most of it. Good to spend a day wondering around the palace and museums. Recommended!","January 29, 2017"
"It's a decent place by itself. If you never seen an Asian palace then you should go. But if you had been to Kyoto, Thailand, or Beijing, then this becomes quite trivial. Don't let this palace be the reason to come to Seoul. ","January 29, 2017"
"It's not the best palace which I've bee and it's nothing compared to some other palaces. Yet, it's definitely worth a visit. Also great to take pictures with other visitors who dressed up as the emperors and empresses!","January 26, 2017"
"This palace has a lot of Korean cultures, it shows the different type of architectural work and design of Old Korea and there is very beautiful nature in the palace as well.","January 26, 2017"

"The first attraction we visited upon arrival to Seoul. It was winter so it was not crowded at all (though, I've never been there during the other seasons) so you can take time in taking photos and just walk. Just as the other tourist attractions in South Korea, the palace is well maintained, toilets and surroundings are clean, tourist information areas are present, and English tourist maps and guides are provided.Admission fee is KRW3000 but you can get a discount if you're visiting in group of at least 10. Good thing is, if you have enough time, there is an integrated ticket which you can purchase for KRW10,000 and entitles you to visit the other major palaces and temples in Seoul. The best thing about the attractions in Seoul is the location. The attractions are pretty much close to each other, hence they are easy to find, especially if your using the subway. The National Folk Museum is located just next to Gyeongbokgung, and you can visit the place for free. You can visit other nearby Museums after, head to Bukchon Hanok Village and stroll at Insadong and Samcheongdong afterwards. Then you can take pictures at the Gwanghwamun gate as you head off to the subway on your way home (what we did, since we entered the Gwanghwamun Subway Station as we got back home).**If you don't mind long walks, it's better to walk from one attraction to next.**Just make sure to wear your winter clothes to keep you warm as it gets really cold especially when it's windy. Bet you don't wanna spoil your tour when you're busy keeping yourself warm. :)If you plan to visit Changdeokgung, I suggest you alot another day for that to appreciate, then you can go to Jongmyo Shrine after. You can also exchange Changdeokgung and Gyeongbokgung. Both are near Bukchon Hanok and Insadong-Samcheongdong","January 24, 2017"

I did not see any maps for visitors to take along (maybe I missed it), hence, some places that I walked had nothing much to view.

Would love to come back during the day. Just beautiful to see with snow around it as we were lucky enough to. Quite a contrast to the city around it,"January 21, 2017"
"Good to go with a tour guide ( its own staff). I had one speaks in Mandarin. She is very patient,and the tour was about 1 hr. She had inteoduced some background about each palace and what was happened to the original building. I won't get much information if i go by myself. ","January 21, 2017"
Great place to see and understand the history of Seoul. Be sure to come for the changing of the guards to witness a cultural performance from days that've past. There are shops that let you rent cultural Korean clothes but it was a bit too cold so we passed on that. Easily accessible from the MRT.,"January 19, 2017"
The surrounding area of the palace is quite vast so you could just walk around anywhere and imagine what it was like for the past kings and queens. Entrance is ₩8000 but there's an integrated ticket (₩10000) if you want to get to all palaces. Check this place out and explore it! Witness the guard changing at 10AM and 2PM. Try the guard costumes for free (first come first serve basis!). ,"January 19, 2017"
"If there is a royal residence one must visit in Seoul for history lovers, its got to be Gyeongbokgung.

There are many interesting things to see here and even a museum inside (that's totally worth a visit), but I have to say that having visited all of the palaces in Seoul, this one is not the best in my opinion. I would advise visiting Changdeokgoong and getting a tour of the Secret Royal Gardens. It's a stunning place, and the quiet nature of the gardens is surprising.

A few of my korean friends went to Gyeongbokgung to show a few friends from overseas. None of us had been there but we just walked around by ourselves casually. It's mostly all seen from the outside so was a bit cold in winter but still a good stroll on a fine day. Allow around 2 hours to have a wander and appreciate the architecture and korean culture here (we didn't go to the museum). One end faces the president's blue house and the other end faces gwanghwamoon. There will be people walking around in the korean traditional attire as there are places to hire them around the palace and the entrance to the palace is free if you come dressed so. But the entrance fee is cheap anyway ,"January 17, 2017"
"There are free tours of the palace grounds at certain times of the day (in English, Mandarin, and other languages).

Changing of the guards was nice, and they let you take pictures with the guards after (like London), and same rules apply, don't touch them.More than the changing of the Guards, what I liked more was just being able to roam around the palace and take many pictures on their grounds, it is so surreal, so many historical K-dramas floated through my mind.The trees on this property are so gorgeous, my eyes kept floating from the plants to the architectures and back.Once I visited this palace, I didn't feel the need to see any other. They also have a cute and very clean café to purchase snacks and drinks. My only regret was not knowing to rent a traditional hanbok (Korean dress), before going to this Palace.

"The greatest of all five palaces (not counting Unhyeongung as a palace), this palace ""thoroughly impressed"" me with: firstly the great statues of Admiral Yi Sun Shin & king Sejong the Great at the approach to the Palace, secondly the magnificent Gwanghwamun Gate with a big wide ""stone base"" where there are three entryways & with ""colorful"" ceremonial guards right outside, thirdly the main palace building after passing through two more beautiful gates (but not with ""bases"" unlike Gwanghwamun the first gate), and fourthly the ""huge expansive"" palace grounds stretching pretty far back for about a 15-minute walk ""non-stop"" from the main palace building to the building which is kind of like a museum all the way at the far end of the palace grounds (but yes it will actually take you a lot longer than that ""non-stop walking time"" to get to the far back since there are several buildings to ""meander around"" on the palace grounds and also two big ponds each with a beautiful pavilion in the middle which offer ""just amazing"" views for pics with my favorite one being that of the cylindrical pavilion in the middle of the big pond covered with lotus leaves whether you just take a picture of the view itself or use it as a backdrop. The buildings themselves cannot be entered though, many are closed & just to be seen the exteriors (with ""pretty identical"" color combinations of green, dark-red, orange & some tiny blue) while going past them, and the ones that are open including the main palace building with a big throne chair inside are only to be seen from right outside (except for that museum-kind-of building at the far end of the grounds as mentioned above which can be entered although there's nothing much special inside with just books & such on display). And, while wandering on the palace grounds, I was ""quite pleased"" by the sights of beautiful girls in Joseon-era costumes who in my opinion definitely ""enhanced"" the aura of the place, and I was indeed very fortunate to get a photo-op with two of them! :) Also very importantly, I highly recommend catching the big guard ceremony so ""colorful"" because of the beautiful attires they wear and flags they carry (and among those guardsmen are those with musical instruments playing music too); that ceremony happens only twice a day at 10 am & 2 pm at the area between Gwanghwamun Gate (the first gate) and the second gate although the small change-of-guard or such event takes place on like an hourly basis right outside Gwanghwamun.The ""closest"" metro station to the Palace is Gyeongbokgung Station (on Line 3) which is immediately to the west of the area between Palace's the first two gates (Gwanghwamun & the second gate) but you won't get to enter the Palace through Gwanghwamun Gate or see the two big statues if you come out of that station, so the ""best"" metro station to the Palace in my opinion is Gwanghwamun Station (on Line 5) just a short distance to the south of the Palace (you'll be right between the two big statues when you come out of that station and will enter the Palace through Gwanghwamun Gate just about a 5-minute walk away).Also like to to suggest getting an 'integrated ticket' as they call it for 10,000 won (the equivalent of US$10) which covers this palace and three others (namely Changdeokgung, Changgyeonggung & Deoksugung) plus Jongmyo Shrine and which is valid for like a month; and do keep in mind that this palace & Jongmyo Shrine are closed on Tuesdays whereas those other three palaces are closed on Mondays (so I went to this one & Jongmyo Shrine on Monday and the other three palaces on Tuesday of the week I was in Seoul).","January 9, 2017"

"A pretty well reserved place, beautiful! You can really get a pick of Korea's history here. Not much of an.exhibition inside the constructions but plenty of places to walk around and get amazing photos.Kind of hard during winter considering the amount of time spent outside.","January 5, 2017"
You will recognise many locations appearing in Korean dramas. A very beautiful place to take a slow and romantic walk. Alas I was with my young children. Seems that you get free entrance if you are wearing the hanbok which we didn't try. But seeing many people in hanbok set a very nice atmosphere. It is also in walking distance to the famous ginseng chicken restaurant so plan to visit before or after your lunch :),"January 5, 2017"
"Once you've seen 1 palace, you've seen it all (in my opinion). The only difference here is that you get to watch the changing of the guards. Good thing it was winter time when I visited. The weather, though cold was bearable. I can't imagine walking around this place during summer. I might literally melt :)","January 5, 2017"
"Recommended to buy the Combination ticket that costs W10,000 and gives admission to 5 sites plus the Secret Garden. Advisable to look for the schedule for the guided tours and the changing of guards which are listed online for easier planning. This is easily the most crowded of all Palaces in Seoul.There are also 2 good museums onsite - the National Palace Museum and National Folklore Museum Museum. The Gwanghwamun, Bukchon Hanok Village are also around so this visit can easily take up the entire day. Nearby the excellent Tosokchon Samgyetang restaurant is a must visit for ginseng chicken soup.","January 4, 2017"
"Highly recommended to join the free tour at the palace, you may check the timings of the tour on their website. There is no need to sign up for the tour in advance, you can just turn up near the main gate of the palace. The tour guide will explain to you the various living quarters of the palace.I waited for the changing guards ceremony at 3pm but it did not happen, not sure if there was a change in their schedule?There are many people wearing hanbok in the palace. I've checked with the information centre that they do not provide renting of hanbok. You will have to rent it at one of the shops outside the palace.The palace is huge and requires a lot of walking. Hence, it is recommended to wear good walking shoes.","January 4, 2017"
"Gyeongbokgung Palace has to be one of the most budget friendly tourist attractions I've ever been to - at 3000krw it is a bargain.One piece of advice I have is to arrive about 15 mins to the hour - this way it will give you enough time to buy tickets and watch the guards changing (happens on the hour) which will then give you ample time to roam the very spacious palatial grounds. This way you don't have to rush to the entrance if you are somewhere else in the compound to watch the change of guards.I very much enjoyed the palace - we went in the morning and would recommend you do this to avoid the crowds as this is a tourist hot spot. This way you can get lots of photos without people in the way. Having said that the Gyeongbokgung Palace is HUGE - we just avoided the crowds by walking around the outside first where you can admire all the foyer and ceiling art followed by walks next to the water gardens which are a lovely place to admire the wildlife among the water lilies.If you can allocate at least two hours to walk around the grounds - it's very scenic and clean - if I lived in Seoul I would come here for the peace and quiet alone, not to mention it is a great workout if you visit every part of the compound.A must-see and notable attraction if you have time on your trip - it's easily accessible by Subway and not far from other hot spots in the city.","January 4, 2017"
Make sure you go for the changing of the guards and also in time for the guided tours which are free and very informative. Lots of teenage couples walking around with traditional clothing and they don't mind having their pictures taken.,"January 4, 2017"

"This was the first palace I visited, and was the one I enjoyed the most. It was beautiful. My recommendation is that you book a tour as it is more interesting to see the place and know the history. I would think it will be quite boring just to visit and take picture. You can book the free tour provided by VisitKorea, if you are in tight budget.","January 3, 2017"

"Basically only myselg and mom (no other selection can be done). In this gigantic palace and also a main palace which later rebuilt in years, the Josean dynasty has been using other palaces as their main palace. It was to my surprise of the beauty of the palace and a must visit museum to understand the entire historical era of S.Korea kings dynasty. Again, our private tour guide, Juno was like a walking history book explaining to me what was that all about. You can see the water clock, the astrology of the olden days with truly brilliant creation and characters that they have used. The sun dial really beautiful and so do the map of the stars. Gwanghwamun also together in this itin and fascinating by looking at it. The palace is so huge to be true with different set of furnitures, walk way, crafted stones and auspicious animals of ancient belief. Don't forget to see the guards changing time and take a shot with them. That is cool!!Well, check out yourself if you truly indulge into some olden cultures history frel like me besides K-pop! You can even drop by the nearer eating place to raste the beef soup rice to give you warm feeling in a cold winter! No regrets!","January 3, 2017"

"I guess a visit to a palace is a ""must"" for any visit to Seoul, unless you have zero interest in history or photography. If you only have time for 1, make Gyeongbokgung the place to go. Coming here is pretty easy via the Metro (at the very imaginative ""Gyeongbokgung station""). Once you exit the station, there are numerous signs to tell you where to go, and you come out at the National Palace Museum. It is easy to spend an entire day here esp. if you visit both museums (the other is the Folk Museum), wait for the guard-changing ceremony, plus taking pictures of the palaces.","December 31, 2016"

Some of the area in the palace was covered with snow. Very pristine. A short walk a way from the palace was the National Palace Museum and then across the Museum was the area for Bukchon Hanok.

Visited the palace with the free shuttle from Hotel Ibis.The palace is grand and huge. It was rebuild and it is still in the process of rebuilding as it was destroy during the war. I took the free guided tour and it gives us a good history lesson.A good place to visit for at least 4 hours and there is also the changing of guards that you should not miss. A must visit place while you are in Seoul.,"December 12, 2016"
"We enjoyed walking around the palace grounds and watching the changing of the guards. What we initially thought was a canon being shot off nearby was actually a massive drum being struck as part of the guard changing performance. Was also only 3,000 won to enter so very cheap. Highly recommended","December 11, 2016"
"From our hotel its just a 20min subway ride, however we have to change to a different line to reach it.The best is to get the guards changing duty time in advance in order to catch it first hand.It is more of a growth up place, kid really feel bore in this. ","December 11, 2016"
"Many of my friends been to South Korea and Gyeongbokgung Palace and didn't know that they have Change of Guard. Our private tour guide parked the car right under the palace and we walked up, and ta-da, right inside the palace, and we didn't waste any time waiting, and saw the change of guard ceremony. It is a nice palace, and look like the Forbidden Palace in Beijing in many aspects. Saw it in tour info that if you wear the traditional hanbok, you can enter this place for free, plus few other places in Seoul. We went in July and its too hot to wear hanbok, so not sure if its true.","December 11, 2016"
It is indeed a Must See when in Seoul! The guards changing ceremony is an event to watch by itself! The palace is tremendously huge & majestic! U can spend half a day there & be mesmerized by the scenic view of the palace! Gem of Korea!,"December 11, 2016"
"One of 5 palaces, biggest and most popular one.Guard changing ceremony a little theatrical but makes for nice pictures","December 10, 2016"
"This palace was gorgeous! The colours were amazing, unlike any other palace I have visited. It's very big, so you don't feel too crowded with people! Involves a lot of walking because it's so big. Definitely a must see in Seoul! ","December 9, 2016"
"We sign up the free tour guide to tour the palace. You can sign up thru their visit Seoul website.. it needs a local Seoul contact number in order to do the booking, just choose the language tour that you prefer. The is the largest palace in Seoul. You will need a good 1.5 hours there to really going thru all the attraction in there. There are a few tourist attraction nearby the palace, do plan to spend half a day for this area.","December 9, 2016"
"A fantastic Korean heritage place to visit, make you back to ancient and feel the King life. Korean good in maintained and keep that all history to future.","December 9, 2016"
"If you are into history, architecture and learning more of the culture of the previous centuries then this visit to the palace is well worth the time spent. If you are not into history, architecture and learning more of the culture of the previous centuries then if you seen one palace, you have seen this palace already since they all are pretty much alike to me during this period in history and in this geographic area. It is huge and you will get your exercise walking the grounds. ","December 9, 2016"
"After a no show of tour guide which I signed up for half day tour, I decided to go on my own. It is easy to find and the palace provides English speaking tour guide at 3 intervals. She is funny, dramatic and yet very professional. Excellent stories which made this visit very interesting. After the guided tour, you may walk around the palace but two hours should be sufficient as it is rather cold now. Tip: Suggest you stop at the information station to get a map and more info on places to visit at the right hand side at the entrance.","December 8, 2016"
"There's a lot of visitor wearing hanbok, which is amazing. You should definetely use hanbok too, there's a lot of places where you can rent the hanbok near anguk station or insadong. They're wearing the hanbok to gyeongbokgung and bukchon hanok village, since the location are kind of near and you can reach one another just by walking.","December 8, 2016"
Very beautiful place with many place to take very nice photos.You can go across the street to rent the Hanbok.,"December 7, 2016"
"Its a huge palace, right in the middle of the city, made in traditional Korean style. Go early in the day to witness the changing of guards, at 11 am. There is also the museum and presidential palace (blue palace) behind it.","December 7, 2016"
"If you visit Seoul, you must see this place because it's very central, and it's also very famous. You'll see a lot of Koreans wearing their traditional clothes there, which is very cute. The street that faces/goes to the palace is very wide and beautiful. There are some statues there in the middle so you'll know it when you see it. Highly recommended.","December 6, 2016"
Toured this palace and was awed with the architecture. The palace complex was huge. There were also 3 museums nearby which were very informative. I especially enjoyed the Folk Museum. Also enjoyed the changing of the guards ceremony which was intricate and colorful.,"December 6, 2016"
"Din expect it would be so big and din catered sufficient time to cover the whole area. In a way, wasn't with the right crowd as well since I was the only one who watched Kdrama and enjoy scenic walks. Peaceful and pleasant place to have a stroll.  Would recommend to at least visit it once when in Korea ","December 6, 2016"

"Loved it. Go early to avoid tourist crowd - and also if you want to take photos of the palace buildings without the crowds. There are two museums - National Folk Museum which is a very good introduction to how Koreans used to live up till now (cultures, beliefs, way of life). There's also the National Palace of Museum too.I opted for MMCA or MOCA which is on the right side of the palace (if u r facing the entrance) - there's a cluster of private galleries too; Hyundai is worth a visit. If you walk further in, there's where the Bukchon Hanok village is located.On the left of the palace is where all the cafes, eateries and hanbok rentals are. The infamous Tosokchon is there too. Ganghwamun Square is located directly in front of the entrance of the palace too (after the main road). Just alight at Gyeongbokgung palace and there are clear directions leading you directly to the entrance. ","December 6, 2016"

"I visited three palaces during my visit and enjoyed this one the most. It is a huge complex and takes time. The Changing of the Guard is a must see--I think they do it at 11 and 2 pm--but check before making plans. If you have been to the large palaces in China, this will seem familiar but still worth it. Cost is only 3000 won--so under $3 US.","December 5, 2016"
"As this palace was destroyed by Japanese troops in the late 1500's and as it has been redone in the 1800's and as then the builders changed it to look like a chinese palace, we do not really know how it was originally. Anyway the colours are more peaceful than in China and Japan and the motives of the ceiling designs are very beautiful. Worth visiting.","December 4, 2016"

"You can combine folk museum, insadong, bukchon, seoul contemporary art museum with gyeongbokgung. Perfect place to chk the architecture of korean last dynasty Chosun. Perfect place to take walk with children or friend or date even. My favorite spot in Seoul","December 4, 2016"
"Luckily, I and my friends visited Gyeongbokgung Palace while the Royal Guard Changing Ceremony was performed. We find traditional and contemporary atmosphere in the palace. I think this is the most beautiful palace among others palace in Seoul.","December 3, 2016"
"As I guide tourists around the city I visit this palace on average 2x per week and have seen the landscape changes according to season. The architecture is average but even after countless visit, I still love strolling around the compound in particular the garden right behind royal compound. I'd suggest touring in clockwise direction. Start at the main hall, all the way to Queen's quarter, then take right to the servant's quarter. From there walk along the garden, lined by trees, until you found the main lake (there's two lakes inside). In the middle of the lake there's pavillion. Unknowingly, you're already two hours in and nearly finished touring the compound.","December 2, 2016"

This palace even though it's mostly been recreated due to destruction it's been completed Ina truly gorgeous manner. You can wander around the whole complex using just the provided map.

"A lovely historic site to visit; easy ride on the Metro and you are there to stroll and imagine what life was like for those who lived in and worked at the palace. The area near the back with the pond and pavilions is particularly beautiful and restful.It is a bit surreal as skyscrapers surround this human sized place, but that makes it feel locked in time and very special. The museum has a quiet place to enjoy some tea either before or after you see the collection but for my money, the fun is wandering around the palace complex outside. Great place for families because kids can run.","November 30, 2016"

The schedule for the tours can be found on the Visit Korea website. According to the website, you do not need to make advance reservation unless you are in a group with more than 10 people.Eventually, we joined the 4pm Chinese language tour (last tour of the day; main gate closes at 4pm when we were there). The tour lasted 40 minutes and as we were the only family in the group, we could ask the guide many questions, which she patiently explained. We learnt a lot during the tour, including the significance of the animal statues surrounding the main hall, why there are wooden bars at the front doors of some buildings; how the heating system worked, why the emperor created the hangul language etc. Totally recommend joining the tour to get the most out of the Gyeongbokgung visit.","November 30, 2016"

I did not regret checking it out because thats what traveling is all about but i did regret purchasing the bundle since we didnt go to any other palaces.

Went there in late Nov and it was freezing, and therefore we couldn't stay there for long, only went there for around 1.5 hours and we have missed a lot of nice places inside the palace. I would suggest to go in spring or summer time, because it opens for longer hours and provide night visiting with all the lighting at night time, for sure it will look more beautiful than visiting during winter with all the fallen leaves.","November 27, 2016"
"So I really enjoyed this historical site as it was extremely well preserved and great efforts have been put forth to ensure that the authenticity of as much of the past was preserved as possible. Some may disagree, but lest they forget, much has happened in the last hundred plus years in Korea that in some countries would not have allowed for such a rich piece of history to be put on display or refurbished good enough to make it a tourist must see spot. Having been to quite a few different historical sites in Korea, this is in my opinion one of the best ones to visit if you are into history. The only negative thing I would say is that this may not necessarily be a fun and action packed location that would inspire too much excitement from younger kids.","November 27, 2016"
"You can go to the Gyeongbokgung station and ascend directly yo the gate of the site. It's a massive complex and quite good to explore. People always flock at the center gates but there'd be lots of space to take nice photos inside the complex and garden. We visited during winter and very manageable number of visitors. The photos are a bit foggy though and while we get to have a glimpse of the mountain backdrop, I can only imagine how beautiful it is during summer or spring.","November 26, 2016"

Having been to quite a few different historical sites in Korea, this is in my opinion one of the best ones to visit if you are into history. The only negative thing I would say is that this may not necessarily be a fun and action packed location that would inspire too much excitement from younger kids.","November 27, 2016"
"You can go to the Gyeongbokgung station and ascend directly yo the gate of the site. It's a massive complex and quite good to explore. People always flock at the center gates but there'd be lots of space to take nice photos inside the complex and garden. We visited during winter and very manageable number of visitors. The photos are a bit foggy though and while we get to have a glimpse of the mountain backdrop, I can only imagine how beautiful it is during summer or spring.","November 26, 2016"
We went there during autumn and it was a very lovely place with a lot of areas that are picture perfect. We went there twice because we felt during our first visit that it's a must to experience wearing Hanbok and so we did during our 2nd visit! Our pictures were great! ,"November 26, 2016"
"Much larger than expected, the grounds are huge. There isn't much to do except walk around and imagine what life must've been like centuries ago at the palace","November 26, 2016"
"No visit to Seoul is complete without a trip to the Gyeongbokgung Palace. If you have time to visit only one palace, make it this one.Start trip with a picturesque stop at the Gwanghwamun with the traditional guards and move on the massive palace grounds, soaking in the ancient Korean architecture and have a feel of what it was like during the Joseon Dynasty.","November 26, 2016"
Being here brought back so many memories of K-dramas. Loved it. My wife and I had this palace as one 1 hour stop of a city tour. This was definitely too short as we were rushed through by our tour guide in order to get to our next location. Definitely will be going back for a slower pace tour offered by the palace in English. Would not recommend self tour as you would miss out on the rich history. Comfortable shoes are a must.,"November 26, 2016"

"You're dazzled the moment you step into the main gates from the street.Locals dressed in the local dress add a priceless touch to the place.The blend of the old architecture with the modern cityscape in the background is something not to miss.It is quite a long walk to the palace itself, but well worth it. A lot of greenery and running waters add a peaceful touch to the place.Be ready to get a lot of photos and don't worry about the food or drink as there are small stalls with snacks and drinks spread throughout the place.Usually, musical shows and concerts are held there at around 7 pm with separate tickets but the settings are usually bewildering.If you get the chance to go, don't think twice.","November 25, 2016"

As you pass through the various sections, you get closer to the main palace and to the old banqueting area. It gives you a real touch of Korea and if you visit the adjacent museum, there is a very good pictorial display of the Korea s history.","November 24, 2016"
"A must see in Seoul, beautiful, typical Korean architecture - wood and ceramic, brightly painted and immaculately clean. I understand that the palace has been completely rebuilt within the last 50 years after it was razed to the ground during an occupation. The tour guides speak an excellent level of English; if you enter at the main entrance, and exit at the back you can see the Blue House past its gates and guards (home of the president).","November 24, 2016"

The last one has been in the past century and is now meticulously rebuilt following the original project.

This was the most beautiful tourist site that we visited in Seoul.","November 16, 2016"

If you're going in the summer, dress comfortable because is was too darn hot! Not much shade unless you're near the palace and the other buildings. There is so much history there which was very interesting. Beautiful palace, a must see if you're a first timer. ","November 16, 2016"

"When I planed to go Seoul, South Korea, the one itinerary must put in my schedule that was Gyeongbokgung Palace. I had visited Seoul fifth times, but I had also went with different people in these fifth times which meaned I visited Gyeongbokgung Palace fifth times. It was because that I would like to explain my experience to them such as the feeling which was comfortable to me walk into Gyeongbokgung Palace and I wanted to share with them. In the recent time of I visited Seoul that was on June 2016 with my friend. As I said, I wanted to bring her to Gyeongbokgung Palace, she wasn't understand why we will go an old and non-shopping viewpoint. But she finally accepted this itinerary. On that day, we woke up early and went to Gyeongbokgung Palace. There provided many kinds languages of guided tour to introduce the Gyeongbokgung Palace, and we also joined one guided tour. When the guider started to explain, introduced and we was walking around the Gyeongbokgung Palace slowly. She changed her mind and told me that thanks my recommend. I was happy that she agreed with me it had a strong historical atmosphere in Gyeongbokgung Palace. In my opinion, I will suggest you walk slowly to see and visit that non-commercial, silence environment.","November 16, 2016"
"It was a good place to explore and understand the history and culture of the korean during old days. I would suggest for travelers who interested of knowing more about culture and history, shall spend at least 3 hours to complete the whole palace. A free guided tour in English, Chinese, Japanese and other language are available at selected time slot (may get this information from the website). The tour takes about 1 hour to 1 and half hour with a guide to explain and story-telling about the history and what are the building for.

"I was lucky because I got to see the changing guard ceremony when I was there. Two times this palace got destroyed by fire but now it stood so majestic in the northern part of Seoul. The palace itself represents traditional culture mixture with contemporary architecture. The palace has a huge compound with beautiful scenery that allows visitors to take endless photos especially if you are wearing hanbok. Inside the compound there are two museums, too bad I didnt get the chance to visit it.","November 17, 2016"

"This was the main royal palace of Joseon dynasty. The first one was build more than six centuries ago, but was then destroyed and rebuilt a few times. The last one has been in the past century and is now meticulously rebuilt following the original project. The whole area offers several buildings to visit including huge gates, palaces, small and bigger buildings. Expect to spend at least a couple of hours to visit this area. This was the most beautiful tourist site that we visited in Seoul.","November 16, 2016"
"The palace is huge so just keep in mind that you will have to walk the whole palace. We watched the changing of the guards, took pictures with the guards outside. If you're going in the summer, dress comfortable because is was too darn hot! Not much shade unless you're near the palace and the other buildings. There is so much history there which was very interesting. Beautiful palace, a must see if you're a first timer. ","November 16, 2016"

In the recent time of I visited Seoul that was on June 2016 with my friend. As I said, I wanted to bring her to Gyeongbokgung Palace, she wasn't understand why we will go an old and non-shopping viewpoint. But she finally accepted this itinerary. On that day, we woke up early and went to Gyeongbokgung Palace. There provided many kinds languages of guided tour to introduce the Gyeongbokgung Palace, and we also joined one guided tour. When the guider started to explain, introduced and we was walking around the Gyeongbokgung Palace slowly. She changed her mind and told me that thanks my recommend.

In terms of grandeur, it cannot compare to the Imperial Palace in Beijing but we were told that this was intentional given the political situation at that time in history.","November 9, 2016"

"First off, don't expect to get through the grounds of the palace quickly. It is one of the most extensive palaces in Asia. Most of the buildings are only a few decades old, mainly due to ancient conflicts taking heavy tolls on them. That being said, they are very well done reproductions and do show how amazing the palace grounds must have been in their heyday. There is a changing of the palace guard every 15 minutes from 10:00 am - 2:00 pm which is a bit more colourful that some others I've seen, though not as extensive.One aspect that impressed me was that the English descriptions were quite detailed. This is something that is not necessarily encountered in other parts of Asia.I would consider this a must-see if you have an interest in the history of Korea.","November 8, 2016"
"I have been to Gyeongdong Palace a number of times.I also am from the US. This time I brought a visitor from the U.S.. We are both cabinet makers, so in visualizing the construction of the palace and other buildings on the grounds, we were impressed. That's not to say that there isn't an air of falsity about the restoration/renovations/reconstruction of the compound. The buildings are not that old. The grounds are not maintained as if they were still a living quarters. One is left wandering about without having a true grasp of the daily life of the palace grounds. There needs to be more visual and written placards What is important is with an imagination a person can picture how people moved about and how the city was laid. There is room for improvement. Drop your iPods, cell phone and other tech devices. Imagine 100 years ago. 200 years ago. ","November 8, 2016"
"The main palace in Seoul and also attracts the most tourists. However, we didn't go in the palace since it has empty spaces only and most of the rooms were closed.","November 8, 2016"
"The palace is very easy to get to by Metro and the exit takes you right to the main courtyard of the palace. It gets quite busy although doesn't feel too crowded as the grounds are quite big. It seemed that a relatively popular activity was to dress up in local traditional attire which was available for rental. I didn't go for that personally but there were many families, school groups and also couples that did so and this somewhat added to the atmosphere of the palace.A striking contrast was the backdrop to the palace grounds where on one side you had the mountains and on the other side you had the tall modern buildings of the city. Aside from the main preserved buildings the gardens themselves provide nice photo opportunities particularly around the pond areas. There are also replica buildings that have been constructed that you can wander in to.The palace also has changing of the guards which I unfortunately missed so worthwhile checking the times and getting there to catch the ceremony.Note that the vast majority of the visit is outdoors and walking around the grounds so do be prepared.","November 7, 2016"

"It's in Seoul but when you are there you feel miles away from the city, mountains in the background, a lake with a fab pavillion to look at - absolutely brilliant to look at and spend some time there","November 9, 2016"
"Nice palace with great view, great culture and great history.You will require at least 2-4 hours to spend time and roam around. Must see if you are tourist.","November 9, 2016"
"A visit to Gyeongbokgung Palace with a guide will give you a glimpse of imperial life during the Chosun dynasty. Total visit will probably take only about an hour at the most starting with the public areas and continuing to the private chambers of the king and the queen. The palace is located in the heart of the city and is quite accessible. In terms of grandeur, it cannot compare to the Imperial Palace in Beijing but we were told that this was intentional given the political situation at that time in history.","November 9, 2016"
"I visited other 2 palaces before comming here, and found it's big, and I was very tired and hungry at that time, so I ended the visiting within 1 hour. exactly, 2-2.5 hours would be better. ","November 9, 2016"
"Entering this palace is like we walk in the history.Trying to imagine what the live in the year of 1300 looks like.It's definitely a grand palace, huge complex with lot of green sceneery inside.Love the roof architecture.I personally like Hyangwon-Jeong pavilion, a royal residence of Emperor Gojong. Surrounded by lotus pond, makes this place so beautiful and serene. Direction to this attraction : stop at Gyeongbokgung Palace Station (Seoul Subway Line 3), Exit 5.Instagram : @adjimantoro","November 8, 2016"
"First off, don't expect to get through the grounds of the palace quickly. It is one of the most extensive palaces in Asia. Most of the buildings are only a few decades old, mainly due to ancient conflicts taking heavy tolls on them. That being said, they are very well done reproductions and do show how amazing the palace grounds must have been in their heyday. There is a changing of the palace guard every 15 minutes from 10:00 am - 2:00 pm which is a bit more colourful that some others I've seen, though not as extensive.One aspect that impressed me was that the English descriptions were quite detailed. This is something that is not necessarily encountered in other parts of Asia.I would consider this a must-see if you have an interest in the history of Korea.","November 8, 2016"
"I have been to Gyeongdong Palace a number of times.I also am from the US. This time I brought a visitor from the U.S.. We are both cabinet makers, so in visualizing the construction of the palace and other buildings on the grounds, we were impressed. That's not to say that there isn't an air of falsity about the restoration/renovations/reconstruction of the compound. The buildings are not that old. The grounds are not maintained as if they were still a living quarters. One is left wandering about without having a true grasp of the daily life of the palace grounds. There needs to be more visual and written placards What is important is with an imagination a person can picture how people moved about and how the city was laid. There is room for improvement. Drop your iPods, cell phone and other tech devices. Imagine 100 years ago. 200 years ago. ","November 8, 2016"
"The main palace in Seoul and also attracts the most tourists. However, we didn't go in the palace since it has empty spaces only and most of the rooms were closed.","November 8, 2016"
"The palace is very easy to get to by Metro and the exit takes you right to the main courtyard of the palace. It gets quite busy although doesn't feel too crowded as the grounds are quite big. It seemed that a relatively popular activity was to dress up in local traditional attire which was available for rental. I didn't go for that personally but there were many families, school groups and also couples that did so and this somewhat added to the atmosphere of the palace.A striking contrast was the backdrop to the palace grounds where on one side you had the mountains and on the other side you had the tall modern buildings of the city. Aside from the main preserved buildings the gardens themselves provide nice photo opportunities particularly around the pond areas. There are also replica buildings that have been constructed that you can wander in to.The palace also has changing of the guards which I unfortunately missed so worthwhile checking the times and getting there to catch the ceremony.Note that the vast majority of the visit is outdoors and walking around the grounds so do be prepared.","November 7, 2016"
There's quite a walk from the start to finish. We're on a tour in Oct and the weather was perfect for this site visit even though the temp climbed to 20 degree Celsius. ,"November 7, 2016"
"It was colder than expected as there was alot of open area. Dress warmly if you are visiting in late autumn or winter. There are ramps around so bringing a pram is still better than carrying baby the whole day. Do exit by exit 2 if you want to rent hanbok. I exited by exit 5 and there waa no rental booth there, though it directly linked to the subway. ","November 7, 2016"
"I had to cross the main road (traffic lights road) to the main gate of this palace. Luckily we got experienced to see the morning "" morning guard ceremony"" with the traditional/ancient musics. And also there is Interpretation Services Offered Tours depart in front of the information center at Heungnyemun Gate.Duration: About 1 hr - 1 hr 30 min.

"I stumbled to this place after walking through the insa-dong street neighborhoods. There is an entrance fee of 3000 KRW, about $3 u.s. dollars and it's worth the price. I did not join any tour groups, I explored and wandered on my own. The place can get dusty as the interior of the palace grounds are all light gravel. I visited this place on a weekday during the morning hours and it was somewhat crowded with mostly young kids on a field trip.The place could be toured with in 60-90 minutes","November 6, 2016"
Visited the palace and garden on 30 th October 2016. Beautiful autumn colours. Don't miss live changing guard ceremony. Rich with Korean culture. Must see palace.,"November 6, 2016"
"You can go there by train or bus and just a few walk to the palace. Entrance fee is 3,000 KRW and you should visit there since morning because it's very large. For women who would like to wear Hanbok (traditional dress), you can rent from shop near the palace before and go inside. If you buy ticket and go inside, it cannot re-entry to rent the dress later.","November 5, 2016"
I learned a lot about architecture from visiting this palace. Also a lot about Korean history. It is well worth a visit.,"November 5, 2016"

"Visited the palace and garden on a busy Sunday. Beautiful and well maintained palace, beautiful colors, clean facilities and nice shop. Certainly worth the visit!","November 5, 2016"
"It's a great place and it's well preserved. It remains intact and is situated in front of the Blue House, and behind the statue of King Sejong. If you want to know more about South Korea's history, this is the way to go.It only took us a 3-5 min. Walk from our guesthouse, (Guesthouse Korea). There was a performance for like every 20 mins or so? Where performers dress up as the way that people dressed before and did the rituals etc. To depict the old times. At the end of the ceremony, some performers stand outside the palace and station there where you can take a picture with them (Proper manners and gestures should be observed. They'll feel violated if you get touchy with them.)Inside, I can say that the overall palace is well-maintained. The comfort rooms are also great. Once you get out, you will see the front of the Blue House, you can also take a stroll in the side walks to enjoy the streets of Korea while enjoying the views of the falling leaves of the tree's","November 4, 2016"

"This is a good tour to learn historical Korea. You will find a couple of grand palaces in that big compound. If you come in before 10 am, there you'll see a live marching guard like in Buckingham Palace in Korean version. It will run for about 30 minutes. If you come in wearing a hanbok or traditional costume of Korea, your admission fee is free! To my surprise, quite a number of locals came wearing their hanbok..Those who wore them became instant Hollywood stars...why? They look cute & blend well with the palaces on the background so those tourists took advantages of those nice shots as souvenir! By the way, if you're interested, few hanbok rentals is just near outside the palace itself. Go for it!!","November 4, 2016"
"I'll admit I was lucky. I was there on the one(?) day of the year that those who wear traditional Korean outfits got in free. The site was abundant with traditional attire. That enhanced the tour. It's a non-rush tour. It was enjoyable, pleasant, had hidden places to sit and relax. A tour guide would be helpful to learn more, but wandering alone was fine. Go near all the way to the north to see the pond. Sit, relax and enjoy. Once you finish, visit the free museum just to the west, by the subway entrance. If you're a history buff, you'll enjoy.","November 4, 2016"

Didn't get to see the inside of the palace because we didn't realise it closed at 4pm. Was in the courtyard and the views were lovely.

Very interesting.,"October 31, 2016"
"Small, pretty, well-preserved. Worth visiting in Seoul. However, if you've seen the Forbidden City, then there is nothing particularly spectacular or grand about this place. I enjoyed it because I love Asian architecture, and enjoyed the animal sculptures throughout the place which are a bit different from the ones I've seen in China. Can get crowded with school groups visiting. Wear your hanbok for free admission. ","October 30, 2016"
"The biggest palace in Seoul. A lot of beautiful buildings to see. Its strongly recommended to buy combined ticket for all the palaces (5) - 10 000 W and try the guided tour. Its free, all guides speak fluent english and explain all that you can see.","October 30, 2016"
"Love their free tour guide service. She explained well on the history of almost each building and kept it lively. however, we miss the guard changing ceremony","October 30, 2016"
"We had a wonderful time there. We rent hanbok/traditional korean clothes at a store outside nearby the palace to get free entrance inside the palace.It wasnt that crowded when i visited, so i managed to take quite a few good photos","October 30, 2016"
Went by day and by night and preferred the night experience especially the light and dance shows which were very uplifting - left with a nice happy warm feeling!!Fascinated by all the locals dressing up to get their photos taken - was even tempted but too tight to pay the $50 charge! ,"October 29, 2016"
"Very popular with tourists. A lot of people but still very nice to walk around. I would take a whole day as the place very big.Around 2pm, there is a changing guards in front.Bring your drinks and foods to sit inside and have break. It would be a nice place to have some drink and food.","October 29, 2016"
This is a small place to take a stroll....I visited here ten years ago and this time it was packed with Chinese tourists...shockingly many of them.And some crazy boys running here and there I simply couldn't enjoy this place..Visit here on week days..주중에 방문하실 것을 권해드립니다 주말에는 중국인 관광객을 비롯하여 떠들고 설치고 분위기를 해치는 요소들이 너무 많았답니다 ,"October 29, 2016"

"This palace is very impressive, however, it is the most popular one in tourists and therefore very crowded. This does not add to its atmosphere. If you leave the central parts of the palace and wander around in the park, it becomes much more solitary.

"Gyeongbokgung is also one of the places to visit in Seoul. Not only is it beautiful to see, it is also easy to find and free of entrance! If you exit from City Hall (blue line) subway exit 2, walk down the road up until the end. It is aproximately a 15minute walk. On the way there you will find the statue of King Sejong (3rd king and supporter of Hangul) and Yi Sun-Sin (famous naval commander). You can also take the purple line to Gwanghwamun which is closer but does not go from Seoul station.","October 27, 2016"

Very lovely palace complex but there is not a huge amount to see apart from the buildings. It would be better if there were some exhibitions in it. I did take the audio guide but again would be good to have more detail etc on the guide.There was one very nice lake at the back but it just needs a little something more.,"October 26, 2016"
We arrived at 2:00PM just in time for the changing of the guards. I highly recommend seeing this ceremony as it helps one imagine what it must have been like hundreds of years ago at the palace. It is not abundantly clear but you need a ticket to enter the inner courtyard and you can purchase them on the far right of the outer courtyard. Once inside you can peer into throne rooms and walk around the grounds. We were treated to a concert of traditional instruments out in front of the coffee shop (note: every Korean tourist attraction will have at least one coffee shop). One other treat was the high percentage of people walking around in Hanbok (the traditional Korean garb). Wear your walking shoes. This place is not very wheelchair accessible.,"October 25, 2016"

"During our time in South Korea, being the history buffs we are, we purchased the Integrated Pass for Palaces, which basically gave us tickets and access for all five major palaces for 10,000 won, as compared to 14,000 won if purchased individually instead. From our visits, we could safely say that out of the five, Gyeongbokgung Palace seemed to be the most well known, and perhaps unfortunately, the most crowded too.We happened to visit during the Golden Week holiday period in China, and that meant hordes of Chinese tourists swarming the Geunjeongjeon, or Throne Hall. It would have been a little more ideal if I had been able to secure a slot for the night tour, where the crowd is much lesser and it is more beautiful for night photography. Luckily, it seems that most tour groups bring their tourists to the Geunjeongjeon area only. Beyond that, if you are willing to walk more and more further, you will be rewarded with less crowds.The architectural style of the palace is somewhat closer to the Ming Dynasty style, such as the Forbidden Palace for example. This is in contrast to the other palaces such as Changdeokgung Palace, which has a more traditional Korean style. It might look similar at first glance, but on closer inspection, some differences can be seen. The Gyeongbokgung Palace that is seen standing today is actually a reconstruction and restoration, as the original one was sadly demolished during the Japanese colonial era in 1915. Still, the amount and scale that has been restored so far is astonishing and must be seen first hand to understand the very soul of Korea better.The National Folk Museum of Korea happens to be inside Gyeongbokgung Palace and it can provide a respite from the heat with the building itself being air-conditioned. The exterior of the museum is quite beautiful and is worthy of some great shots. There is also the Hyangwonjeong Pavilion that is worth walking far enough for a great shot. You should not miss the royal guard changing ceremonies done by reenactors that take place at Gwanghwamun, the main gate of Gyeongbokgung Palace at 10 am and 2 pm. The ceremony takes about 20 minutes and it is an experience you should not miss. You can even take photos with the royal guards after the ceremony too!Do take note that Gyeongbokgung Palace is closed on Tuesdays and sometimes it may close if it gets too crowded, so do plan accordingly. A night tour would be even better if you are able to get a slot. This is an excellent place to see both the locals and tourists in Hanbok, the Korean national costume, since those in Hanbok get in for free. If you want less crowds however, I would strongly suggest Changdeokgung Palace instead if you only have time for one palace to visit.","October 21, 2016"

"The palace is open for public visits. And as with most of the palace worldwide, there is guard changing ceremony. If i'm not mistaken, it is carried out twice a day. Its an interesting ceremony and tourist should grab the chance to watch it. The entrance fee is quite cheap and inside, you can take pictures and learn many Korean's history. There is also some place inside where you need to pay extra if you want to enter. Fir me, i just pay the initial entrance fee and spent around 2 hour visiting the palace. To go there, its quite easy using the subway. ","October 20, 2016"

"Great place for pictures, go on a weekday if you can because weekends can get overcrowded with tourist buses. It was amazing to walk around and sight see. Very beautiful and it was very memorable. It is not very friendly to strollers, especially in the entrance areas. It will not be a smooth ride. I recommend baby wearing if possible. ","October 21, 2016"

The palace is an commanding structure and gives a real sense of the wealth and sophistication of Korea at the time when Europe was still emerging from the Middle Ages. But, the thing that we found most impressive was the pride and patriotism shown by the Korean people, many of whom were dressed in colourful, traditional costume.

We were marveled at the architecture in a very distinct Korean way and the detailed danchung painting of the roof overhang. In addition, Goenghoeru Pavillion in the pond was an outstanding idea to have a royal reception or celebration among noble people. Walking northbound, we were able to see a part of neighboring Chungwadae which is the residence of the Korean President in the backdrop of a mountain and it was absolutely beautiful. For the entertainment, there are changing guard procedure and military drill as the King watching. This can't be compared to the changing guard performance of Buckingnam Palace in London in quality, but it adds to understanding of the Joseon Dynasty.

"The palace is huge, with a lot of buildings. Walking is easy though, as it's mostly flat. The palace features the mountains as its backdrop, enhancing its picturesque quality.

"Wow--for a limited time (24 Sep-28 Oct 2016) they are offering special night tours of Gyeongbokgung Palace. If you've never been before or have only visited during the day, I highly recommend trying to get down there. It was the best 3,000 won I have spent in Seoul!!!! Called the ""Bridge of Time"" there was a spectacular light and dance show at the Gyeonghoeru Pavilion. Don't ask me how they did it but the building kept changing colors--it was so impressive I had to watch the 15-minute show twice. They also had a portion of the show dedicated to a traditional dance in front of the Pavilion, all the while with the lights changing. Plus, upon entering the complex there was another light show as you crossed Yeongjegyo Bridge in the bed of Geumcheon Stream. I read in the local press this is the first time they have had this kind of light show there. The tours run from 19:00-22:00 with the final admission at 21:00. When I was there people began lining up around 6:00 pm and I was told they begin selling the tickets around 6:45 pm. 500 tickets are set aside for foreigners, which are bought at window #1. I arrived around 7:45 on a Sat evening and was still able to get a ticket but may have been lucky as there was a big firework show going on that same evening elsewhere in Seoul. While still crowded, I suspect it was less crowded than normal. Cost was 3,000 won, which is the normal entrance fee. While only a limited part of the complex is open it was nice to see everything all lit up and provided a different perspective to my daytime visit. The special light show and dance performance at Gyeonghoeru Pavilion were done four times and lasted about 15 minutes: 19:20, 20:00, 20:40, and 21:20. I arrived at the tail end of the 20:00 performance and could barely see anything there were so many people. I opted to wait the 25 minutes between shows and got a position in the front center that was great for photo taking. Afterwards, I wandered around a bit and was passing by in time for the last show which was the least crowded so watched it again, it was that good. Anyhow, I was super impressed and plan on recommending this night tour to others. If you are in Seoul right now, go...it will probably end up being one of the favorite stops you make!","October 8, 2016"

"There are quite a few palaces in Seoul. The sheer size and scenic location within the city with the mountains in the background, as well it's historical significance make it a must-see in my opinion. It's located fairly centrally and easily accessible via the metro. There are also quite a few other museums located nearby. Our ticket allowed us free entry into the Folk Museum (or Children's Folk Museum? or both, I can't remember). You can spend hours walking around here. You can't enter the chambers or rooms but you can walk through the main structures and there are a lot of them! Wear good walking shoes.There are many ramps around so it's also very wheelchair and stroller accessible. Clean bathrooms with toilet paper, soap and water are also on site. In order to visit the pavilion, I believe you need to make an advance reservation online. A visit to this palace can be as short or long as you want, but if you want to see most of it (at a leisurely walking pace), you should allot at least 2 hours. It's felt smaller than the Forbidden City in Beijing China, and the restorations seemed more apparent. Still, the buildings and layout were beautiful.","October 7, 2016"

In places it did feel a little busy- lots of people around. But at no point did it feel overwhelming. I got used to the fact that Seoul as a place was densely populated so figured everywhere you went would be people in large numbers. I loved the juxtaposition of the placement of the place cradled between modern buildings all around was this nugget of history within the city. Make sure you go with a full battery on your camera or phone. Much needed. You can enjoy a traditional tea ceremony too. Plenty of literature also to inform all those niggling questions.

The decorations are really nice! Just one problem though, there wasn't enouh info about the places in this palace. We didn't want to walk with a tour and wanted to look around on our own pace so we didb't get much info.There's a good resting place with food and drinks and souvenir shop at the entrance. you can get a hanbok and wear it while you go around.","October 1, 2016"
"The guard-changing ceremony in the first courtyard (with the ticket sale counters) would be quite worthwhile watching.The entrance to the palace grounds from Gwanghwamun gate looks quite ordinary, but once you get past all the initial buildings and explore the grounds, it's very beautiful with all the trees and lakes. There are very signboards explaining the buildings' histories or usages. If I had gone with the free tour (set times), I'd probably have been more interested in the buildings!","October 1, 2016"

Check out the timing of the performance and the translation guide and price before you go.  It is very interesting naming of the each courts in the palace.

"This place is an absolute must see in Seoul. Its a huge palace complex with lots of history. Should be combined with Bukchok hanok village and Changdeokgung Palace since these are close by and will give a great portion of historic Seoul.If you really are someone who likes to walk I would recommend the following route.Start from Gwanghwamun station (or City hall station and pass Gwanghwamun gate) and follow the main street towards Gwanghwamun Square. Here you will see two huge statues, The statue of the Admiral Yi Sun-sin and Statue of King Sejong. Then just walk towards Gwanghwamun Gate and into Gyeongbokgung Palace. Then take trip into the The folk museum of korea and head up to Bukchok Hanok village. when you get back down from the village, have a nice lunch and head into the Changdeokgung Palace which is just next to the village entrance. When you're done go passed Anguk station and straight into Insadong. Do no visit insadong early in the morning. Go all the way through Insadong and down to Cheonggyecheon Stream.

"Visiting royal palaces in South Korea produced in me in the long term the same effect of visiting many Buddhist temples in Thailand: they look like very similar, even though size of buildings inside may change. However Gyeongbokgung Palace deserves a visit especially for the very nice entry gate and the change of guard ceremony (held twice a day, at 10am and 2pm), the last one being very solemn. I visited the palace during the day and I must admit that the atmosphere was not so enticing as it could be during night. Free guided tours in English are also offered, which I found very useful to understand a bit more the history of royal families in South Korea.","September 21, 2016"

"Visiting royal palaces in South Korea produced in me in the long term the same effect of visiting many Buddhist temples in Thailand: they look like very similar, even though size of buildings inside may change. However Gyeongbokgung Palace deserves a visit especially for the very nice entry gate and the change of guard ceremony (held twice a day, at 10am and 2pm), the last one being very solemn. I visited the palace during the day and I must admit that the atmosphere was not so enticing as it could be during night. Free guided tours in English are also offered, which I found very useful to understand a bit more the history of royal families in South Korea.","September 21, 2016"
"If you only have time to visit one palace in Seoul, this is the one you should visit. I recommend checking the time the royal guard will change, so you can watch the ceremony. ","September 21, 2016"
"Gyongbokgung Palace is located not far away from CitiHall Station, walk only 15 minutes north bound following the modern road at the down town Seoul. It is the popular destination of Seoul visitors. The environment of ancient palace of Joseon Dynasty is well maintained and fully restored. The most waited attraction is palace guard changing. The complex is vast and need some time visit and to understand the historic means of the palace.","September 21, 2016"
"I went there in the weekend it was busy and full of people. it was very large that you could enjoy taking pictures of different spots. three different performances are presented a day, attending one of them is enough they all seem the same and very simple. I would command the large changing ceremony. the palace is recommended for people who are interested in history and architect.","September 21, 2016"
"The first of Seoul's palaces we visited, and by far the most impressive. Incredible architecture & fantastic English guide, who explained so much in so little time. The changing of the guards ceremony was also worth staying to see. Really worth visiting.","September 21, 2016"
"The place is just marvelous. This is where no-filter IG-worthy pictures are made of. You can join the tours and watch the changing of guards. The entry fee is cheap like around 2,000 won only and there's a lot to see here.","September 20, 2016"
It's been there over a thousand years in spite of the Japanese burning it down twice. There is a free tour with an English speaking docent that I highly recommend.,"September 20, 2016"

"Visited last September 17, 2016. If you are a sucker for history and architecture, then this shouldn't be missed when touring Korea! All the palaces are instagram-worthy!

"Nice photos to take, but if without a guide its boring, however i guess you can read about it beforehand so that you can enjoy more. Takes around 1 hour to 2 hours depending on how much photos you take :)There is an option of a combo ticket for 4 palaces and a temple, but although i bought it i do not recommend you do it unless you really enjoy this repetetive rooms and buildings :)May be just one palace and one temple would be ebough, so no need to pay for the combo ticket Try not to miss the guard changing ceremony and take photos witg the guards. So do go early (not after 1:30 pm) to be able to attend one of them (held each 15 minutes i guess)","September 18, 2016"
It is one of the most important places in Seoul! If you are intersted in history and Korean culture in general dont miss it! They do English tours for free to explain the hlights of this great plalace! You will see many Koreans wearing traditional clothes which is super cool!,"September 18, 2016"
Its really easy to reach this palace. You can take subway then stop at Gyeongbok gung palace station. The interesting thing is you can rent Hanbook and you can feel as korean woman/man. Don't forget to watch replacement of bodyguard of this palace in the morning and also noon. Really recommended.,"September 17, 2016"
"This place is great for all types of travelers. It allows those who like history to be able to read and see about a Korean Dynasty. For those who like architecture and cool structures, it gives you a ton to see and lots of detail to explore. And those who like to just go and walk for a little while, it gives you freedom to explore to your liking.

It would have been nice if there were placards or even a recording in English to understand what each building was used for. Either way, the grounds are beautiful.

It's amazing being able to visit this palace thanks to major restorations and rebuilding. It is a small version of the Forbidden City in Beijing which reminds us of China's historical and cultural influence over Asia.The admission was free because of Korean Thanksgiving when we visited but I would say it's worth it.

"This is one of the main and most visited attractions in Seoul, a large palace ground that depicted the rich and long history and culture of the country.We came by here as part of our city tour and it was crowded when we arrived with mostly foreign visitors. The palace is nice with lovely architectural building designs of the ancient times, to some extent, similar to the Chinese versions (no doubt because the country was with good ties with China in the ancient times and thus more or less being influenced by it), nice lakes and ponds with lots of greenery.What is interesting is the schedule of the ""change of ancient guard"" ceremony at selected timings where soldiers who were dressed in ancient and traditional Korean costumes, marching in and is impressive and usually this scene attracted most crowds. One can also change into these traditional costumes to walk around and take photos.Many visitors here would like to compare it with the other Changdeokgung palace (please refer to my earlier review here too), that is also located nearby. The latter is smaller in size and has much lesser to see but overall with similar themed buildings. We were told by the guide that the reigning king would stay in the former palace while retired king would reside at the latter.However, do take note that the palace is closed on every Tuesday (while Changdeokgung is closed on Monday).It's an interesting place to visit and be prepared to spend at least 1.5-2 hours to be able to see substantial things here and remember also bring an umbrella, hat and bottles of drinking water as it was very sunny and warm during our visit there.

"The actual palace can only be observed through a wide opening. One cannot actually enter the palace buildings, one can just walk around them and get an impression how the royalty functioned in ancient times. The Koreans do their best to keep up old traditions and it is fun to see the guards dressed up in traditional attire and to see the Changing of the Guards ceremony. In the area there were many patriotic young Koreans walking around being photographed in traditional costumes that it is possible to rent for a few hours at the Hanok Center nearby. The colorful costumes and the Changing of the Guards make the place more interesting. When we were there it was very hot and there is very little shade. Take big hats/sunshades...","September 11, 2016"

"We visited five palace areas in Seoul, and liked them all. Gyeongbokgung palace is huge, and the scenery behind it is beautiful (mountains look gorgeous)! We ended up sitting by the pond with my friends for hours, just chatting and laughing. At one point the park guard had to come tell us to leave, because the park had closed. The atmosphere was very relaxed.Make sure to get the palace pass which gets you into all the five main palace areas in Seoul. It costs 10,000 won and can be bought at any ticket counter near the entryways.","September 10, 2016"

This was my favorite of the Seoul palaces-- don't miss it. Very large grounds to walk around and very impressive to look and and for photos.,"September 11, 2016"
"The actual palace can only be observed through a wide opening. One cannot actually enter the palace buildings, one can just walk around them and get an impression how the royalty functioned in ancient times. The Koreans do their best to keep up old traditions and it is fun to see the guards dressed up in traditional attire and to see the Changing of the Guards ceremony. In the area there were many patriotic young Koreans walking around being photographed in traditional costumes that it is possible to rent for a few hours at the Hanok Center nearby. The colorful costumes and the Changing of the Guards make the place more interesting. When we were there it was very hot and there is very little shade. Take big hats/sunshades...","September 11, 2016"
This is the number one place to visit for all first timers. Guaranteed you with lots of group tours and people with kids learning about the history. Huge place that takes up to 2 hours for a visit! Get the palace and jongmo shrine pass for easy/quick/best value access!,"September 11, 2016"
"We visited five palace areas in Seoul, and liked them all. Gyeongbokgung palace is huge, and the scenery behind it is beautiful (mountains look gorgeous)! We ended up sitting by the pond with my friends for hours, just chatting and laughing. At one point the park guard had to come tell us to leave, because the park had closed. The atmosphere was very relaxed.Make sure to get the palace pass which gets you into all the five main palace areas in Seoul. It costs 10,000 won and can be bought at any ticket counter near the entryways.","September 10, 2016"
I like this place very much. Learned about Korean history. It was very pretty and well kept. It was huge and exactly what we expected to see since I have watch lots of Korean movies and see the palace on screen before ,"September 9, 2016"
The Changing of the Guard was a great photo opportunity. The palace itself is interesting and a nice contrast with modern Seoul right outside the walls.,"September 9, 2016"
A sprawling complex with many buildings. Take the tour. That is so helpful. One thing that we found enchanting was the presence of so many young Korean people dressed in native costumes. It was like stepping into the past. ,"September 9, 2016"
"On exiting the metro station, I was approached by a group of Korean youngsters offering tours of the Palace. My guide was a 15 year-old girl speaking perfect English. She was excellent. She refused a tip - said they were not allowed","September 9, 2016"
"This is one of the Seoul ""Top 10"" attractions, but the reviews on Trip Advisor are not unanimously good - so I went wondering if it would be enjoyable, or a bit of a let-down. Well I'm pleased to be able to report that I thoroughly enjoyed it. I had a good walk around Gyeongbokgung Palace and also popped in to the Korean Museum of Folk Culture next door.I found the Palace very interesting and rather impressive (I did not do a guided tour, I just walked round by myself). Entry is 3000 Won (around US$3, GBP£2) which is absolutely excellent value for money. There were quite a lot of locals there in traditional and very colorful dress, which really brightened the experience.It took me 2 hours to have a really good look around and take my photos. The Folk Museum I mentioned earlier I do not recommend. I spent just 5-10 minutes in there and it will certainly be of much more interest to Koreans than to visitors. Nevertheless, entry was free so I'm not complaining... just advising!I notice more than one review comparing Gyeongbokgung Palace with the Forbidden City in Beijing. Gyeongbokgung Palace is much smaller (although still occupying quite a large area) but quite similar in its layout and appearance. Please don't go to Gyeongbokgung Palace hoping or expecting to find an equal of the Forbidden City, but I think you will find something equally as interesting although rather less dramatic in scale.The day I visited the weather was sunny. I would not advise going on a rainy day, I think that would totally spoil your visit.Overall, very highly recommended.","September 9, 2016"
Nice overview place to begin first visit to Seoul from the US. Good review of the history in many languages. Enjoyed the guard change ceremony. Never saw so many selfie sticks used in one place. ,"September 9, 2016"
"Fascinating and majestic palace - well restored. I love that it has the mountain range as backdrop, beautiful lakes within the compound and located in downtown modern Seoul. Easily accessible by public transport or taxi. We missed the cultural performance but saw the performer in traditional costumes - very colorful and pretty!","September 8, 2016"
"A very nice place to visit, be with the historical atmosphere, go through Korean history with English translation device.outside there is a folklore singers with old tradition dresses. ","September 8, 2016"
"Having seen the palace in China, the Gyeongbokgung Palace is really nothing in comparison. But it is still a history of Korea.","September 8, 2016"
"A good interesting day and a real feel for ancient Korean culture, the temples look amazing, can get busy and hot depending on time of year but certainly worth a visit if you are in Seoul.","September 7, 2016"
The palace was very popular. The palace is kept in good condition and provides a good perspective on life in the palace when it was inhabited. ,"September 7, 2016"
"I was so looking forward to seeing this palace but ended up feeling underwhelmed. Compared to palaces in Europe, this palace is very Plain and underwhelming, with lack of displays and information. ","September 7, 2016"
It's quite a large place with lots of buildings but not a hell of a lot else. There's not a lot of information about the place historically or otherwise which is a real shame and some of the information is only in Korean. Definitely not a place to keep kids occupied.,"September 7, 2016"
"The palace is situated in middle of the high rises that gives you a sense of the Korean culture and how it has developed over years with skyscrapers on one side and this well preserved Palace in middle.I would suggest to at least take the audio guide but guided tour should be preferred,this helps in providing the context of the history for the palace.Overall this is a highly recommended place to visit in Seoul.","September 7, 2016"

The restoration of the building is done very well and it is nice to walk through the estate. The entrance ticket is not expensive - paying around 15 € for a family of 5.

It's like a vivid museum. Quite unique place to visit as this is the only place that all the shop names are written in Korean, even Starbucks.**Samcheongdong is a must go place for people who love to take photo. There are old houses, built in a traditional Korean way, Hanok. However, its a residential area so if ever you visit, Id recommend you to keep quiet there.**Gyeongbokgung, the palace, is nice place to chill, walk around, and take photos with family or partner. There is entrance fee. Free for Koreans below 25 and discounts applicable for disabled, elders, and kids. For foreigners, 4,000 won fixed.There was a package that allows one to visit all the palaces (7 if I remember it right) or special programs done inside the palace with limited space. You can register online and check up the website for those things. Im not so sure if there is any additional charge. Maybe not?**Lastly, Tongin market sells Korean food in affordable price. You can change 5,000 won to 10 old coins, purchasing food in some assigned stalls. Quite cool experience and just nice to have a grasp of some Korean food.Parking lot of the palace is quite cheaper than other parking lots in Seoul. First two hrs is 2,000 won fixed. So I got to go around without any pressure.Cons:More like a side note, the palace closes once a week.(I think it ks Tuesday) so better be aware and not waste your time.There is not much things to do inside.

"We visited this palace mainly to see the changing of the guard ceremony, but were pleasantly surprised by the beautiful architecture. It is the largest of the five (5) palaces and was built in 1395. It was destroyed by fire during the Japanese invasions in the 1500's, but rebuilt in 1867. In 1915 the Japanese returned to destroy most of the palace buildings, and built their colonial headquarters here. Many of the building and gates have been recently restored.It was very peaceful at 9am and there were no crowds, so we were able to view the architecture at our own pace. The most impressive building was the Geunjeongjeon (Throne Hall) which had twelve pairs of stone markers outside and a huge throne to the rear of the building.It will take approximately an hour to view the palace. The National Palace Museum is located outside the palace walls, but was closed (on Monday) when we visited. The Folk Museum is to the North East of the palace complex and admission here is free.After viewing the palace grounds and visiting the folk museum, we got in position to view the changing of the guard ceremony which began at 10:30am. It was well choreographed, and we were able to take videos and photos of the entire ceremony. It is advised to get to the roped area as early as possible, as there was a huge crowd. The ceremony is done daily, except on Tuesday.Admission was W3,000 for adults and W1,500 for children. It may be easily reached by taking subway line 3 to Gyeongbokgung Station, and using exit # 5.","August 31, 2016"
Huge grounds and lots of walking. Beautiful architecture and preserved or rebuilt buildings. We had the advantage of our own tour guide and that made the experience ever so better as there are very little explanations for self travellers.We learned a good understanding of Korean architecture and engineering.

The most impressive building was the Geunjeongjeon (Throne Hall) which had twelve pairs of stone markers outside and a huge throne to the rear of the building.It will take approximately an hour to view the palace. The National Palace Museum is located outside the palace walls, but was closed (on Monday) when we visited. The Folk Museum is to the North East of the palace complex and admission here is free.After viewing the palace grounds and visiting the folk museum, we got in position to view the changing of the guard ceremony which began at 10:30am. It was well choreographed, and we were able to take videos and photos of the entire ceremony. It is advised to get to the roped area as early as possible, as there was a huge crowd. The ceremony is done daily, except on Tuesday.Admission was W3,000 for adults and W1,500 for children. It may be easily reached by taking subway line 3 to Gyeongbokgung Station, and using exit # 5.","August 31, 2016"
Huge grounds and lots of walking. Beautiful architecture and preserved or rebuilt buildings. We had the advantage of our own tour guide and that made the experience ever so better as there are very little explanations for self travellers.We learned a good understanding of Korean architecture and engineering. Also the garden at the back is beautiful with the lily pad filled Lake... Certainly worth a visit,"August 30, 2016"
The admission fee is reasonable $3 but my advise to read about the history before you come which will give you sense to what you will see as international tourist. Choose a cloudy day in summer to avoid heat. ,"August 30, 2016"

"Gyeongbokgung Palace is the first royal palace that was built during the 500-year Joseon Dynasty. It is the largest of the 5 grand palaces in Seoul and my family and I visited this restored palace on a sunny Thursday morning in June. Getting there and fees: Take Exit 5 of Gyeongbokgung Station on the Line 3 Subway. Upon exit, National Palace Museum is on your left while Gyeongbokgung Palace is on your right. The entrance fee is 3,000 won for adults and 1,500 won for youth. This Palace is closed on Tuesdays.The Palace: We were there just in time for the 20-minute Changing of Royal Guards Ceremony at the square between Heungnyumun Gate (inner gate into the Palace) and the Gwanghwamun Gate (outer gate) starting at 10am. There are altogether 6 guard changing ceremonies starting every hour between 10am and 3pm. To me, the Guards ceremony is the highlight of the Palace since it’s a great opportunity to experience the re-enactment of a historical ceremony or scene in traditional Korea. The guards’ colourful uniforms, the emblem-laden and colourful flags that they carry and the musical instruments that they play are a fabulous feast for the eyes and ears and of course the cameras and handphones! And not many people know about a costume experience in wearing one of the four military uniforms – sumunjang, gapsa, jungbyoung, daejol – free-of-charge at the Sumunjangcheong Building next to the Gwanghwamun Gate entrance. We had 2 lady staff who put on the uniform for us, and after that we had only 5 minutes to take photos (hence it would be good if you have a companion with you). This is only available within the half hour after the changing of the Royal Guards ceremony, which is good since all the tourists would go into the Palace grounds. Also, don’t forget to take photos with the stationary guards on duty outside the Gwanghwamun Gate. You could stand next to them but just don’t disturb them.While the historical Palace is located in the midst of modern Seoul, I also saw that it is located with imposing hills as its backdrop. The walk in the Palace courtyards, halls, pavilions, gates, buildings and gardens is also something not to be missed, as it would enhance your understanding and appreciation of the Korea culture and history. It would be good to be part of a free guided tour in English (do check their timings). Depending on the extent of what you want to know and see, it would take at least 2 hours to cover the entire Palace.I am tempted to compare Gyeongbokgung Palace with other renowned palaces outside of South Korea, but it would be comparing apples with oranges. Suffice to say, we enjoyed visiting Gyeongbokgung Palace and would definitely recommend this attraction when you are in Seoul.","August 18, 2016"

The guards’ colourful uniforms, the emblem-laden and colourful flags that they carry and the musical instruments that they play are a fabulous feast for the eyes and ears and of course the cameras and handphones! And not many people know about a costume experience in wearing one of the four military uniforms – sumunjang, gapsa, jungbyoung, daejol – free-of-charge at the Sumunjangcheong Building next to the Gwanghwamun Gate entrance. We had 2 lady staff who put on the uniform for us, and after that we had only 5 minutes to take photos (hence it would be good if you have a companion with you). This is only available within the half hour after the changing of the Royal Guards ceremony, which is good since all the tourists would go into the Palace grounds. Also, don’t forget to take photos with the stationary guards on duty outside the Gwanghwamun Gate. You could stand next to them but just don’t disturb them.While the historical Palace is located in the midst of modern Seoul, I also saw that it is located with imposing hills as its backdrop. The walk in the Palace courtyards, halls, pavilions, gates, buildings and gardens is also something not to be missed, as it would enhance your understanding and appreciation of the Korea culture and history. It would be good to be part of a free guided tour in English (do check their timings). Depending on the extent of what you want to know and see, it would take at least 2 hours to cover the entire Palace.I am tempted to compare Gyeongbokgung Palace with other renowned palaces outside of South Korea, but it would be comparing apples with oranges. Suffice to say, we enjoyed visiting Gyeongbokgung Palace and would definitely recommend this attraction when you are in Seoul.","August 18, 2016"
"Def a must while in Seoul. Very beautiful and huge!! You can spend hours wandering around. You get to see lots of buildings and gardens. A few times per day there's a guards change (check website) - recommend! Get an English tour (it's free, btw, and only 1 hour) - there are few per day. And the National Folk Museum of Korea is within! Also nice and not too big. ","August 18, 2016"
"We followed a private tour around the palace, which was great! Oh, and rent a Hanbok and walk around the palace - the admission is free, and heaps of people will want to take photos with you - see what it's like to be a mini celebrity for a day! ","August 16, 2016"
"I went as the palace was in the centre of Seoul - I had already visited the Secret Garden and C'bok Palace earlier in the trip - so didn't expect to be overwhelmed in comparison. To be honest - I think this was my favourite Palace in Seoul. Firstly the scale is immense when one considers it is slap bang in the middle of the city. secondly - when you are expecting to just wander through labyrinths of palace buildings, you stumble across beautiful gardens and pools of water - the gardens themselves are extensive and astonishingly pretty. I found it very peaceful and a refugee from the Seoul summer heat. I would advise any visitor to take themselves off for a visit and at Won 3,000 for an entry ticket, it was incredibly cheap compared to the prices to visit palaces and castles at home in the UK.","August 15, 2016"

"Gyeongbokgung Palace was my second favorite palace in the city. Its so huge that you really don't have to go visit any of the other palaces as they are all extremely similar. I probably spent around 2.5 hours walking around and admiring the beautiful architecture and natural areas located within the palace grounds. There was a free show performed by the locals as I entered the palace gate, which was quite interesting to watch as they were demonstrating a scene from the past. The National Folk Museum of Korea is located on the same grounds, which was a nice pit stop along the way. I'll keep my review short by saying that it was worth the visit as the palace is rich in culture and history and it's so big that you can get the full palace experience!","August 14, 2016"
"Gyeongbokgung Palace is a great place to see houses of royal family members and to know something about their history and lifestyle. It has a huge beautiful territory, it took us about 2 hours to walk through the palace. It also includes admission free museum and a small cafe/restaurant. There are ceremonies for the Opening and Closing of Palace Gates and Guard Changes. Several times a day there are free guided tours in Korean, English, Chinese and Japanese.

"The Gyeongbokgung palace is definitely worth a look if you are visiting Seoul. Set at the north end of the city against a mountain backdrop, Gyeongbokgung is actually one of three Joseon dynasty palaces that formed a palatial precinct before it was systematically broken up during the Japanese occupation in the early 1900s. Much of it has now been restored or rebuilt.The original throne hall survived the destruction and is a relatively open building so you can usually see inside, even if the palace is crowded. There are some beautiful gardens and quiet courtyards that I found I had to myself despite visiting in the middle of Summer break. There is also a guard in traditional dress at the main south gate. It routinely changes with great ceremony during the day and the accompanying narrative is interesting. You can see most of Gyeongbokgung in about 3 hours but if you have more time, wander a little further and see the nearby palaces of the Queen and Crown Prince.","August 12, 2016"

"This is a must-see if you go to Seoul, especially to understand something of Korea's cultural history. The palace is actually a huge complex of buildings square in the midst of downtown Seoul's business district, so it's accessible by car, bus, or metro. Parking is at a premium,however, so use public transport if at all possible. Be advised that this tour requires lots of walking due to the size of the complex, numerous buildings & gardens, etc. If you're there in summer, except it to be HOT, so be prepared. An umbrella is a good idea, both in case of rain & for shade if it doesn't rain. The buildings are serene & beautiful outside & surprisingly plain inside. On our visit there were numerous Koea-American, Koean-Canadian,& Korean-Australian young women there in full traditional dress, which is beautiful & adds to the charm of the place. It's kind of a pilgrimage for them, apparently. Don't miss the excellent museum adjacent to the complex. Nice & cool in there, & the exhibits are interesting & help you understand what you're seeing outside. (I suggest doing the museum first, then the complex.) The restaurant adjacent to the museum offers a limited Korean cuisine. If that doesn't appeal to you, there are numerous food outlets in the near downtown area, but that will involve more walking. You should allow at least 3 hours to tour the museum & palace complex, more if you intend to stop for a meal. But this is a great place to visit, highly recommended.","August 2, 2016"
"A very nice experience, also accessable with a stroller (once you manage the metro). The guards with their plastic toys look funny at its best (artificial would probably be a better description). If you are there, try to make use of the free app provided (free wifi everywhere) or the english guided tour. The adjoint folk museum is interesting and provides aircondition to cool down during high season. ","August 2, 2016"

An umbrella is a good idea, both in case of rain & for shade if it doesn't rain. The buildings are serene & beautiful outside & surprisingly plain inside. On our visit there were numerous Koea-American, Koean-Canadian,& Korean-Australian young women there in full traditional dress, which is beautiful & adds to the charm of the place. It's kind of a pilgrimage for them, apparently. Don't miss the excellent museum adjacent to the complex. Nice & cool in there, & the exhibits are interesting & help you understand what you're seeing outside. (I suggest doing the museum first, then the complex.) The restaurant adjacent to the museum offers a limited Korean cuisine. If that doesn't appeal to you, there are numerous food outlets in the near downtown area, but that will involve more walking. You should allow at least 3 hours to tour the museum & palace complex, more if you intend to stop for a meal. But this is a great place to visit, highly recommended.","August 2, 2016"
"A very nice experience, also accessable with a stroller (once you manage the metro). The guards with their plastic toys look funny at its best (artificial would probably be a better description). If you are there, try to make use of the free app provided (free wifi everywhere) or the english guided tour. The adjoint folk museum is interesting and provides aircondition to cool down during high season. ","August 2, 2016"
"Small but beautiful palace! Cheap and easy to go by subway with a direct access to the Palace. The moment we left, there was a ritual ceremony at the gate, it was beautiful, a must visit place. ","August 2, 2016"
"Great place to take your time and walk around the palace grounds. If you can time it just right, watch the ceremonial changing of the guard first. This will last about 15 minutes and then you should explore the grounds. ","August 2, 2016"
"Ok, so this is a nice place to visit and is really interesting to see such history in the middle of the city. There are very many people walking around, but I never felt too crowded as the ground are really large. The buildings are all very similar (as was the theme of the other palaces we visited), same architecture, colors, etc. there were so many little rooms which had no explanation. The grounds of the palace were mostly gravel, with the exception of the building in the middle of the water, but we could not figure out how to enter it. Nice experience, but I would not spend too much time there.","August 1, 2016"
This is the best palace (of the 3) in Seoul. Strongly recommend to take the free language tour (check times on their website) or book one with Seoul walking tours (free as well)...w/o someone to explain the deep history / lifestyle its just a bunch of building. The guard changing ceremony is okay nothing special. ,"August 1, 2016"
One of the most beautiful palaces I have been to. The secret garden was worth the extra fee. I felt transported back into a time of princes and princesses. Vast courtyards and beautiful gardens where the royalty once escaped to find peace from the outside world. Cherry blossoms were in bloom to make this experience even more magical.,"August 1, 2016"
"This formed part of a private tour we'd organised, so we didn't need to buy tickets or think on timings... we simply were guided, informed and enjoyed.The changing of the Royal guard was stunning and brilliantly translated over tannoy :-) Our guide explained many many interesting facts about the architecture, history, residents and traditions relating to both the palace, residencies and grounds. In the grounds is also the National Folk Museum... Well worth visiting with its excellent exhibitions and Korean history timeline board... please stop to read it, rather than just walk past, or you'll miss out on knowing so much!!There is also a children's museum, so all ages catered for.","August 1, 2016"
It was my first time to be there and it is a really a comfortable place to walk around and get to know about the history of Korea. Highly recommend you to go if you haven't been there. It is a place that I think one must go in Seoul.,"August 1, 2016"
"The first time i went to Gyeongbukgung Palace it was raining.

"I have visited Gyeongbokgung four times in the last few years, the latest was this spring. The area is massive and I would highly recommend taking a tour if it is your first time to get the most out of the experience. The workers are very friendly and the changing of the guards is always fun to watch. Also make sure to check out the free National Folk Museum in the northeastern section of the complex.","July 31, 2016"

It was hot as blazes - be sure to dress for heat and bring an umbrella - not for rain - but for shade! You can look in to the palace, but visitors are not allowed inside - you have to peer-in. The palaces are interesting, though after you see one or two, they begin to look very much the same. I would recommend choosing two to visit and then move on to something else.","July 23, 2016"

It's history, with successive destructions and recontructions, speaks to the resilience of the Korean people and is a testament to their coming of age as a unified people. The grounds offer a serene walk through compound after compound of simple and delicate architecture, decorated internally with vivid colors and patterns. I also highly recommend the museum!","July 22, 2016"

"This was the first Korean palace we visited - it is a 5-minute walk from the Gwanghwamun subway stop. The admission fee is minimal ($3.00 I believe), which is appropriate. It was hot as blazes - be sure to dress for heat and bring an umbrella - not for rain - but for shade! You can look in to the palace, but visitors are not allowed inside - you have to peer-in. The palaces are interesting, though after you see one or two, they begin to look very much the same. I would recommend choosing two to visit and then move on to something else.","July 23, 2016"
"A grand palace with impressive architecture. The palace ground is large and the trees give it a cool ambience. You can visit the museum, the traditional house and take lots of pictures.","July 23, 2016"
Gyeongbokgung Palace did not disappoint. There was a lot to admire and the size of the palace grounds was very impressive. There is also a shop within the grounds which had beautiful handicrafts and served amazing drinks. ,"July 22, 2016"
"With a beautiful backdrop of green mountains, the palace is an exquisitely restored (and partially reconstructed) monument. It's history, with successive destructions and recontructions, speaks to the resilience of the Korean people and is a testament to their coming of age as a unified people. The grounds offer a serene walk through compound after compound of simple and delicate architecture, decorated internally with vivid colors and patterns. I also highly recommend the museum!","July 22, 2016"
"While this is definitely nowhere as pretty or interesting as similar places in China and Japan, it's still a nice place and you should definitely visit as part of your trip to Seoul. Its a cultural attraction and it's important to learn about the history of the country","July 22, 2016"
I suggest to visit this place with a free tour guide available there. We were approached by a student who volunteer to be our tour guide and we really grateful to had him in our group as we get to know more details about every single history of this place.,"July 22, 2016"
"I visited Gyeongbokgung with a group of friends, it was beautiful weather in March, so I thought it would be very busy....but because the palace grounds are so expansive, even with a lot of visitors it is still quite serene and easy to find some peace and quiet. We didn't visit the museum that is within the grounds, but there was still plenty to fill in a number of hours. I would highly recommend this to anyone visiting Seoul. It's easily accessible and breathtakingly lovely.","July 21, 2016"
"It is one of the only realy cultural things you can do if you ask me so you have to visit it. But i wasnt that impressed, all the buildings looked the same. The pound is nice though.","July 21, 2016"
"We rented hanboks from OneDay Hanbok and it was pretty affordable. This grants you free entry and you get to take nice photos in the palace grounds. Many people will wear their hanboks there as well and you can take photos together in all your pretty outfits. Do note that if it's summer, youre probably going to sweat a whole lot.","July 21, 2016"
very interesting palace of the kings + queens changing of the guards in full ceremonial clothes colourful site .,"July 21, 2016"
"Mostly watched from outside, we were very impressed changing of the guard ceremony accompanied by a military-style drumming, Especially exemplary order and discipline.","July 21, 2016"
"Such a nice place. Im so into historical sites so this is definitely my most favourite attraction in Seoul. The lake inside the palace looks serene and the breeze is so refreshing esp when you visit in summer. Be prepared to do a lot of walking and photos.Before Gyeongbokgung, I went to several palaces. The buildings kinda look the same. Only this palace has more things to see like the lake, the pavilion, the folk museum. They have the combination ticket ( 10000won for 5 palaces or so) but nvm if you dont have enough time to take a look at all 5 as i think gyeongbokgung is enough! In case you wanna have a nice photoshoot with hanbok, probably visit other palaces. They are not as crowded as this place so people will not ruin your perfect photos.","July 20, 2016"
Very reasonable costs and regular changing of the guard. The gardens were good with lots of seating in the shade. Great views of the mountains ,"July 20, 2016"
Rich in culture. Magnificent view. We could see many koreans (and non koreans) wearing traditional korean clothing. Informative and helpful guide. Guide was available at certain timings and in different languages. This is the most famous out of the other palaces. ,"July 20, 2016"
"Walkable from train station. Just before the stairs up from station you can get dressed in royal robes for free, was a fun activity. You can walk through the palace leisurely in your own pace. Good architecture in display, preserved well. You see lot of young couples walking around dressed in traditional costumes, lovely. Plenty of open park space inside. The food shop sells a cold rice sweet drink (non-alcoholic) that was tasty. ","July 19, 2016"

"Must see when in Seoul! Unfortunately it was a sunny sunny day when we visited so husband got tired of walking in the sun and stayed hiding in café. I walked around and took many nice pictures. Amazing feeling to walk around in this peaceful getaway and imagine how it used to be. You have a lovely mountain view in background and other sides surrounded by modern buildings outside the walls.. Inside walls pure pleasure and there is a café inside, and near museum. Not adjusted to walk with stroller or wheelchair from what we could see. Easy to reach by sub and taxi. Recommend it!","July 19, 2016"
"This was a wonderful visit as it somewhat shows you how the Korean people used to live and you can imagine what day to day life was like back in those times. It takes you out of the city even though you are literally in the center. A must-visit when in Seoul. Do be aware, it can get very crowded during busy times.","July 19, 2016"
"I went there with my family and we only walked into the front yard. We did not enter to the palace because we think there isn't much to see and they are not as nice as the Summer Palace in Beijing. However, if you are interested in these kind of places, you got to visit this Palace.","July 18, 2016"
A good place to relax and enjoy the nature. Come to see how the korean royal lived in the past and the architect of korean palace. A place should visit when come to Seoul,"July 18, 2016"
"I was walking down Samcheong-dong and found the entrance to the palace and decided to go in. It was pouring rain that day and really should've gone into the National Folk Museum but I wanted to see this palace and it would be closed the following day. The people were still there despite the rain! This palace was huge with so many grounds and so many buildings, I kept walking and walking and walking. I have to find my pics because my favorite area was this small lake with a small wooden octagon shaped building on an island in the middle. It was so beautiful and since I did not join a tour, unsure fully the history of it or what the purpose was. But, thought that would be a lovely place to go relax in if I had lived in that palace!","July 18, 2016"

It was a popular destination for groups of girls and young women to take shots of themselves in their full hanbok (traditional Korean dress) But they do have a small coffee shop where one can at least get a cool refreshing beverage. Lots of green space which is missing at most of the temples that sport the same beautiful architecture. ","July 17, 2016"

Going to Gyeongbokgung Palace is really very educative and enriching, indeed an eye opener to Korean culture especially in their way of life and government in the past.Every nook and corner of it is rich in history and breathtaking.

"GyeongbokgungA must visit when you visit Seoul. To reach there, take Subway Line 3 to Gyeongbokgung Station and take exit 5. Simply follow the signs in the subway to the exit. Once you have exited, you will see the Palace Museum on the left and straight ahead will be entrance to the Palace. The palace opens 9am to 6pm and earlier during winter. Do check opening days and hours. You need to pay an entrance fee of 3000 won per adult. Free guided tours are available at the entrance at specific times. We managed to catch the Royal Guard-Changing Ceremony between Gwanghwamun Gate and Heungnyemun Gate. Do check the timing as it is interesting to watch the ceremony as the guards are dressed in traditional garbs. It is a great opportunity to experience a traditional scene in Korea, something that we probably only catch in Korean dramas.Bring your camera, your hat (and umbrella or poncho in case of rain) .The palace grounds are big with many residences, halls, pavilions and gardens so it might be wise to follow the free guided tour of the grounds. We were fortunate enough to follow the palace guide of a mandarin-speaking group which had just started. At least you get to learn about the history and the significance of each building instead of wandering around on your own looking at structures that do not tell any story. She also told us where were good photo spots.The Palace guide had such a comprehensive knowledge that I ended up learning so much! Be warned to pay attention as there were some who were wandering, talking on the phone and when the particular section were over, they asked her the same question of what she had already explained coz they clearly missed it doing their own thing. She doesn’t repeat if she know it is because you have not been paying attention and not due to non-comprehension!Unfortunately it was raining a bit when we were there. We would have loved to stay longer and wander a little more to take more photos. Do pop by the Museum before heading for the subway and send a post card home from the Museum shop (you can buy the postcard, stamp and even post it there).","July 14, 2016"
There are quite many people visiting this palace as it is the largest one in the area. Some of the buildings have furniture in them so you can see from the door how the people used to live.

Be careful crossing the courtyards between buildings as we found the stone paths quite slippery on our way out.

"The Gyeongbokgung Palace was the first place we went to. If you're a tourist, this is definitely a must go. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe that the K-drama ""Princess Hours"" was shot at the Gyeongbokgung Palace. You'll see the ""changing of guards"". ","July 11, 2016"
"It's beautiful palace, nice garden, we have learned lots of history. It has been took by China before. They had build the dragon inside to believe that China never got the Korea before.

"I was informed that there are 5 most famous palaces in Korea and Gyeongbukgong Palace is one of them. Located in the middle of Seoul, it is definitely easily reachable by the subway. The entrance fee was really cheap and you can enter for free if you wear the Korean's traditional clothes called Hanbok. It was definitely worth a visit to the palace.","July 12, 2016"

"Everyone says that because it's true. Go for the long version and get there early enough to get a front-row stance. The music, the pageant, the colorful uniforms are a real visual and auditory treat. The rest of the palace is very interesting and clean, neat and tidy. I have visited way too many Asian palaces, shrines, temples and Buddhas and so I can't be trusted to do it justice.","July 12, 2016"
We visited the place at the end of May and it was a little hot and sunny but it was a beautiful place to visit and take photos. You see young girls and guys dressed in hanbok taking photos around the palace which adds a nice touch to the place and the gift shop is also a nice place to visit but it could be a little on the expensive side. ,"July 12, 2016"

"This old palace and the gates are very impressive (built late 1300s) and it is absolutely amazing that the admission is only about $1USD. The palace grounds are quite extensive, so you can easily spend a few hours here if you want to see it all, or just a short time if you only want to walk through the gates and up to the palace.I recommend good walking shoes as the paving stones are a bit uneven in places, and bring water and a hat, as the grounds are quite open with lots of sun.","July 10, 2016"

This is the first Royal palace built in the Joeson Dynasty 500 years ago. The is largest of the five grand palaces remaining in Seoul. It provides a glimpse into Joeson's Royal culture and architecture.

You can take pics with girls dressed in traditional Korean dresses too. Best time to visit is around 4pm as after you can enjoy the evening in Gwanghwamun Square.Admission is 3000 won. ,"July 9, 2016"

Do check out the schedule of the changing of the guard ceremony. This is a must watch if you've not watched it in Deoksugung. The paint of the the buildings looks new and well maintained. Exploring this huge area brings you back to a different era. It is rich in history so it'll be good to do some reading before visiting. The landscape should offer different kinds of beauty in different seasons.Spend at least half a day because there are 2 museums here.

If you can borrow audio service device, try one. You won't regret it. It's much more interesting when you know the background.  Its admission fee is reasonable like KRW 3000(= USD $2), but it's free if you wear Korean traditional custom. There are many rental shop near the palace. Don't miss it.

"Visually, this is an overwhelming experience because of the sheer size and variety of structures and landscapes. Some of them make for some of the best photo ops in Asia. There are also museums on the ground. But what I think is most rewarding -- and important -- is the history that you can learn and the perspective you can gain. As an American who has lived in Asia since 2004, I find the ignorance of my fellow countrymen about the world -- especially Asia -- to be embarrassing. The story of this place takes you through the history of Asia from a Korean perspective: subject first to China, then the various brutal invasions by Japan. Koreans feel an enormous sense of pride in their culture and their strength. As a tiny country surrounded by giants, you really appreciate both when you visit here. Take your time when you come.","July 3, 2016"

Also the museum cafe has nice teas and deserts and a nice ambience.Changing of the guard at 1pm and larger performance at 2pm but don't disrupt your day for this.The folk museum has lots to see but is s bit repetitious after visiting the national museum.Metro drops you right at the front on the orange line.

A very beautiful and big palace. We spent one whole morning walking around the palace and taking photographs. We were not able to cover the whole area.

"Visually, this is an overwhelming experience because of the sheer size and variety of structures and landscapes. Some of them make for some of the best photo ops in Asia. There are also museums on the ground. But what I think is most rewarding -- and important -- is the history that you can learn and the perspective you can gain. As an American who has lived in Asia since 2004, I find the ignorance of my fellow countrymen about the world -- especially Asia -- to be embarrassing. The story of this place takes you through the history of Asia from a Korean perspective: subject first to China, then the various brutal invasions by Japan. Koreans feel an enormous sense of pride in their culture and their strength. As a tiny country surrounded by giants, you really appreciate both when you visit here. Take your time when you come.","July 3, 2016"
"A nice place to visit, large open area with historical architect and palaces, don't miss the guards shift change at the front gate.. I think its in each one or two hours..","July 3, 2016"
"I was almost expecting a life changing experience because of all the ratings. It was ok. We saw the changing of the guards and walked inside the palace... Meh. It looked like many of the other palaces we've seen in Korea. If this was there first one we had seen, maybe I would be more enthused. We also walked into the museum and ate at the cafe. The food was great and reasonably priced. ","July 2, 2016"
"I would recommend entering at the front gate during the changing of the guards. I can't remember exact time it happens. But was a great experience to see the whole ceremony. Once inside, there is so much to see. So be prepared to walk a lot and take lots of pictures. Really beautiful palace.","July 2, 2016"
This is a popular destination especially on weekends. Would try and go on a weekday to avoid larger crowds or early morning. There is English guided tour at 11am which usually attracts a crowd but is worth it to get an overview of the highlights.There's a peaceful tea shop in the back corner behind the lake. Also the museum cafe has nice teas and deserts and a nice ambience.Changing of the guard at 1pm and larger performance at 2pm but don't disrupt your day for this.The folk museum has lots to see but is s bit repetitious after visiting the national museum.Metro drops you right at the front on the orange line.

"Go early so you will enjoy the guided tour in a smaller group. The place would get crowded at a later time. Spend at least 3 hours or up to half a day there to tour around the palace, the National Museum (near the palace entry) and also the Folk Museum inside the palace. Consider getting an integrated ticket for foreigners at krw10,000 to access other palaces and Jongmyo Shrine as well, which certainly save u some entry fee if you are planning to visit most of them.","June 30, 2016"
This is a beautiful palace which you must visit at least once when in Seoul. Do watch out for the guard changing ceremonies and free guided tours.

"The palace complex is huge, with a myriad of buildings and acres of grounds to explore. Firstly don't make the rookie mistake we did - visiting on a Tuesday, when the palace is closed! On returning on Wednesday we were pleasantly surprised to be told that entry on that day was free (not sure that this applies to every Wednesday). In fact, anyone wearing traditional dress gains free entry, but tickets are not expensive at 3000krwon per person over 18, with a small discount for children and teenagers. This is a restoration / reconstruction project on a massive scale, which is being done sensitively and artistically. Photo opportunities abound, particularly changing the guard and the traditional tea ceremony and, of course, the people (mostly very pretty young ladies) wearing traditional Hanok dress, who are only too happy to pose. There is a sparsity of shade, so do take this slowly in the heat. There are cafes and toilets around, but a few bottles of water per person is a must as the heat and humidity can become overwhelming. Allow two to three hours and do try to make your way to the back of the complex, where there are ornamental lakes with pagoda.","June 29, 2016"
"OK, where to start. Allow min half day or more. Come bright and early for the changing of the guards ceremony. Bring plenty of food and water, don't forget to charge your camera and good shoes. Not much refreshments available on the premises so come prepared. If you want to wear a hanbok dress, there are plenty of shops where you can hire them for 1.5hrs - 2 hrs outside the palace. I believe the prices start on 15000 KWR for 1.5hrs. It's a great opportunity to take your pictures in this wonderful setting and ""IN style"" throughout the complex. Definitely worth a visit is also the Folklore Museum with its wonderful restorations of Korean past. The Korean Folklore village's reconstruction is very illustrative and worth a visit for every foreigner. The museum is within a complex and the entry is free. If you need to wind down, there is a small garden towards the north of the complext where you can e.g. let the kids to let some steam out. It's very tranquil there and with offers lovely views. Free 1hr long guided tours are offered on the hour at the entrance. We left the palace by one of the side entrances and enjoyed a well deserved meal in a small restaurant in Bukchon. Great day out.","June 28, 2016"
Make sure to get a tour guide to take you through this amazing Palace. You get so much more out of exploring this sprawling complex with someone giving you context. The changing of the guard is colorful and filled with drums and music. Very cool.,"June 28, 2016"
"It was easy to get to by metro to gyeongbokgung station, and was a pretty good place to spend an hour or two. It's actually really big and I'm not sure if we managed to see the whole place as we weren't given any maps, but the buildings were pretty repetitive after a while. It's probably a good idea to go in hanbok (that you can rent in lots of shops in the area) so you get in for free (although it's pretty cheap anyways), and take cool photos. We went during midday in summer so that wasn't really an option, but in milder weather I definitely would have done that.","June 28, 2016"
"Great to check out the changing of Guards before entering the palace. Entrance fees are very economical at 3000 won for adult. If the main palace is too crowded , it would also be interesting to move to the side palaces or gardens. You could witness the kitchen where servants cook or royals have their meals. Gardens and lakes are so beautiful. The entrance fees also entitle you to enter the folks museum which is worth a trip as well ! Overall, we spent about 3 very enjoyable hours here just strolling on the grounds. Highly recommended ! ","June 28, 2016"

"Yes, it is big, and yes, it is quite impressive at first sight, but that is about it. As you go in all you'll see are the same structures over and over again along walls that are the same. The place is HUGE so you will walk for hours seeing the same thing. Another thing I don't like about the palace is that everything has been repainted so the whole place looked too new, and that is not what I want to see in a historically significant place. There are also wire nets fitted on the under side of the roofs (presumably to prevent birds from nesting and ruining the new paint job?) and that, again, ruined the otherwise beautiful structure. I didn't even want to take pictures because of the ugly nets and brightly coloured paints. In my opinion, Namsangol Hanok Village was a much better place to spend your time. Just go to Gyeongbokgung Palace for their mid-day ceremony (takes about 20 minutes), take some pictures on the outside (which is similar to what is on the inside anyway) and go somewhere else.

The colors and fluidity of the outfits added to the timelessness of the grounds. Being Saturday, it was indeed crowded but not overwhelmingly so as the Palace grounds are just soo big.

A little disappointing as we expected majestic architecture and beautiful gardens since it was the touted as the most beautiful of all the 5 palaces.

I did not have time to explore the palace closely or to even enter the Great Greenhouse so I hope I get a chance to go back.","June 21, 2016"
"An interesting recreation of the palace. It would have been better if more of the original structure still existed. As it stands, it is still a decent place to visit. You can sometimes see traditional costumes and ceremonies.","June 21, 2016"
Not much to say since we didnt go into the Details. Nice place to take some photos. Everything was clean and the place itself was worth seing.,"June 21, 2016"
ive been a fan of korean drama but seeing the palaces brings happiness to me. though not a magnificent as i previously pictured in my brain but it is so spacious. the pavilions were intricately designed. how i wish i lived in thosekind of era. Nice seeing tourists wearing national costumes and have their photos taken ,"June 22, 2016"
I visited this place on May at 1PM and it was very hot outside. You can take picture with the palace guard but please be careful not to disturb or touch him or they could be mad. This palace consists of many buildings inside. Make sure your feet are ok and your stomach is full before coming here bacuse this palace is soo biiigg. I got very tired eventhough i were not explore all of the buildings inside.,"June 22, 2016"
A little disappointing as we expected majestic architecture and beautiful gardens since it was the touted as the most beautiful of all the 5 palaces. We gave the other palaces a miss because of this reason. It took us less than an hour to view the grounds that were opened to public. The guards at the front entrance were however very obliging so we have some good memorable shots.,"June 22, 2016"

"One of the major attraction in Seoul. Probably not as big as China's Gu Gong Palace but since you're in seoul, why not.Most impressive is probably at the front as you enter from the main Gate. As you walk further in, palace gets smaller and more smaller living quarters and they are all look similar.

Be especially mindful of when the ceremony of the changing of the guard occurs as it is a sight to see. It is easy to find and take some walking shoes as there will be a lot of walking.,"June 7, 2016"

"Well maintained palace that is easily accessible, and close by to Insadong, Bukchon Hanok, Gwanghwamun square and Cheonggyecheon so you can visit all these plus go to the famous Tosokchon for Ginseng Chicken soup in one day. The highlight for us was the Change of Guards parade although I think the pace can be a little quicker, we also got to put on guard costumes after the parade for free at a little stand to the right facing the gate. We were allowed to take pictures outside the hut but no kids sizes were available. Palace is not very stroller friendly even though the ground is mostly flat because it is not concrete flooring and pushing the stroller along creates a cloud of dust. All our shoes were dusty after the visit so keep your best shoes at home.","June 6, 2016"

"The Korean palaces are really really simple and peaceful. Beautiful gardens and halls, but nothing too ornate. Should visit at least one of the palaces if you are in Seoul","May 27, 2016"
It was fantastic to visit this palace. It is made out of wood mostly and amazing how it is not damaged after 100s of years. We did not go inside the main part which needs ticket but we're able to see a lot in free ticket zone. ,"May 27, 2016"
"Nice place to visit in Seoul. for people from Europe this is a relatively young historical place, but for US and other citizens - it is old enough to be amazing. in very good condition, full of young people, nice and calm place in the middle of a 10 million-citizens town. great architecture","May 27, 2016"
It was pretty much a muchnes although changing of the guard really good. Inside was sparse and for me just ok. The museum however far more interesting as it depicted life to the present,"May 27, 2016"
Since traveled a lot in Asia i wasnt blown off my feet. but it is a nice place to visit.spend there 2 hours MAX,"May 26, 2016"
"A most interesting location. I was impressed with Korea's maintaining their history, yet at the same time, staying up to date in their new architecture. Place it on top of yourplaces to visit.","May 26, 2016"
This palace is massive. We were lucky enough to be here on a day that featured a Korean song and dance group. It felt as though we went back 200 years.,"May 26, 2016"
The Gyeongbokgung Palace is an interesting place to visit especially if you are interested in Korean history and the way of life of royalty during that era. I cannot say that I could identify with much of what I saw as it was not an area of the world that I know very much about and so did not appreciate a lot of what I was seeing and was being told about.,"May 26, 2016"
"I had visited the Palace when I lived in Seoul nearly 20 years ago and the opportunity to return was worth the wait. Numerous and ongoing restorations have been taking place since 1990, the latest having been completed in 2010. The serene beauty of the Palace is in start contrast to the surroundings of bustling Seoul. A breathtaking experience.","May 26, 2016"
"There are a few palaces, we decided to just see 1 and chose this one. Easy to walk to from myeongdong, 3000 entrance fee per person and you can join a free tour in English (as at the info office) it's also nice to see the changing of the guard. If you don;t want to take a tour pick up a map at the info office just after the entrance and follow it to visit all the main buildings, we were there for a couple of hours - take a break for coffee in the library (i think it was building number 9 on the map). I think it is worth a visit. We went on a Thursday at 12:00 and it was not at all crowded.","May 26, 2016"
"Visit this place if you've been to Changdeokgung Palace and only if you've no other place to visit.Changdeokgung is far more beautiful of a palace than Gyeongbokgung. However, Gyeongbokgung has it's charmed as well. Visit during children day and you'll get free entrance for a day","May 26, 2016"
Marvelous palace in the heart of Seoul.The changing of the guard ceremony is interesting and it was lovely to see young people in their traditional dress.,"May 26, 2016"
"This is a must visit while you're in Seoul. I would say this is one of the major highlights when visiting. You have to pay a small entrance fee of 2,000-3,000 won (roughly about 2-3 dollars US) and once you get in, you are free to roam around. Theres actually a lot of areas to explore in the Palace. Gardens, pond, areas of hanoks and temples. It can get pretty busy and might be difficult to take pictures, so I recommend going early morning. You can also wear hanboks and walk around the Palace as well. Theres also an art gallery close by (outside the palace gates) with lots of traditional Korean restaurants, cafes, shops, etc.","May 25, 2016"
"Its huge!!!!! i needed more tan 3 hours to do the Speedy gonzalez style tour, (walk fast, few pictures and keep going), dont miss it, just try to go early morning and weekends to avoid large groups and school trips groups","May 25, 2016"

This place is very nice. The palace is very spacious.

"Located in the northern part of Seoul city, this palace has many beautiful buildings and nicely landscape garden. Ideal place to make many photos.

"You can only admire everything from the outside. Buildings and surrounding areas are perfectly maintained.

When you are at the palace, don't miss the next famous landmark worth a visit : the old traditional Hankok Village which starts a couple of streets from it.I highly recommend Changdeokgung Palace.

Kings and queens walked the paths I walked. History and laws were created and made here. Its amazing to see that, most part of the walkways around the palace were just dirt. Amazed me that the kings and queens were frugal. Paintworks were beautifully preserved and same goes to the building.

There were so many people on the tour that many times you could not hear the guide or she started talking before everyone could actually get to her location.So many people that it was hard to look inside some of the structures. There were huge tour bus parked outside the palace - so hundreds of people are swarming in at once. I was told by a local that evening when I remarked on the difference experience I had that there is a big uptick in Chinese tourists and these tour buses are everywhere.

Have been to Gyeongbokgung Palace 4 times. It is an interesting place that you are allowed to explore without a tour guide.

At certain times there are performances done by Koreans in costumes that date back to when the Palace was occupied. It is very interesting!,"May 18, 2016"
A stunning reconstructed palace in the heart of Seol.₩3000 to get in and a further ₩3000 for an audio guide and definitely worth it. Not a whole lot of information to read so I recommend the audio guide.Take some time to sit and take it all in and then hit up the nearby shopping district afterwards. ,"May 18, 2016"
"Just go there to relealise this. I had been here more than once. Roam around or just sit. The serene environment and the peace and tranquility will embrace you. If you like History, you will enjoy the years this palace has stood by. If you dont, you will enjoy the Nature here that will help you to be with yourself.","May 18, 2016"
Our first tourist site visit on the trip. It is right at the station that bears the same name. Best exit to use is #5 and then you are right there. We were able to see the changing of the guard.

"This is a great palace to visit for site seeing and photo taking. However, the day I went with family, was Korea Culture Day and it was overcrowded with locals and tourists. Also, without a guided english tour guide, we were quite lost in the palace. I prefer the Changdeokgung Palace over Gyeongbokgung Palace.","May 17, 2016"

If it is warm and humid then prepare to sweat as you will be walking a lot.If you plan it right you can also get in for free as we did this time (by chance), but the downside is having far bigger crowds than usual.Make sure you also see the Blue House which is at the back if the park.The palace is beautiful, very traditional korean. The ponds and park also make this a great outing. For a better experience try to come during the change of guards or other special events to be fully immersed in korean traditions.If you are in Seoul and you only have time for one palace then this is the best!","May 17, 2016"
Awesome palace...just like in the kdramas I've watched. Great sight and for picture taking as well. A myst see change if royal guards. ,"May 17, 2016"
"I happened in Seoul a bit out of accident, but have loved this city. It's important to mix a bit of culture into a trip and the central location of this palace did make it an easy visit. Admission is also quite cheap. The guards dress very vibrantly and ate stationed on the front gate. Have your picture with them, just no touching. Time spent here is dependant on the individual, I grew restless after a few similar looking buildings and some nice gardens and completely missed that there was even a gift shop, the place is quite vast so if you want to see every nook and cranny than budget a couple of hours. Also be prepared for the school tours and a fair number of people. ","May 17, 2016"
Have been to Gyeongbokgung Palace 4 times. It is an interesting place that you are allowed to explore without a tour guide. There are many buildings on the large grounds that you can walk into and take pictures. Most of the signs are in Korean as well as English. At certain times there are performances done by Koreans in costumes that date back to when the Palace was occupied. It is very interesting!,"May 18, 2016"
A stunning reconstructed palace in the heart of Seol.₩3000 to get in and a further ₩3000 for an audio guide and definitely worth it. Not a whole lot of information to read so I recommend the audio guide.Take some time to sit and take it all in and then hit up the nearby shopping district afterwards. ,"May 18, 2016"
"Just go there to relealise this. I had been here more than once. Roam around or just sit. The serene environment and the peace and tranquility will embrace you. If you like History, you will enjoy the years this palace has stood by. If you dont, you will enjoy the Nature here that will help you to be with yourself.","May 18, 2016"
Our first tourist site visit on the trip. It is right at the station that bears the same name. Best exit to use is #5 and then you are right there. We were able to see the changing of the guard. The palace was built in 1394. It is from the Joseon Dynasty. Good for wandering and taking pictures.,"May 18, 2016"
"Enjoyable tour of the palace given, free of charge, by students of the local language college wanting to improve their English. If asked do say yes to this service. It really is free and you'll get much more out of your visit. Lovely kids.","May 18, 2016"
"This is a great palace to visit for site seeing and photo taking. However, the day I went with family, was Korea Culture Day and it was overcrowded with locals and tourists. Also, without a guided english tour guide, we were quite lost in the palace. I prefer the Changdeokgung Palace over Gyeongbokgung Palace.","May 17, 2016"

"I read a few strongly negative reviews, so that sort of inspired me to write a less nasty one - for balance... I do not know if I was just lucky, and went there at the right time of the right day, but there was virtually NOBODY else around, outside of my immediate party. Of course, that could possibly have had something to do with the company that I was in, as my friends' father was a high ranking Korean military hero? He was sort of leading us around this venue, and I suppose that may have been the reason why nobody else was around at that time, but I think it was a neat place, and I'm glad I got the chance to see it. It was a splendid photo-op, to mark of my checklist.","May 15, 2016"
"Beautifully restored after a tumultuous history that left large parts destroyed, the palace is a monument to the resilience of Koreans and the importance of their history. More understated and elegant than the Forbidden City, the palace can be enjoyed as a stroll in an hour or as a full half days' exploration activity. For future visitors: there is not much shade (particularly in the central parade ground area where the changing of the guard may be viewed) and it can be very hot in the summer months.

The most impressive and very large palace in Seoul that you have to visit if you have a day time. For me it was the first stop. At the end of the visit I enjoyed the changing of the guard ceremony. Must go!,"May 14, 2016"
Cant help but give this one top marks. It was nice and peaceful in the palace grounds which was great away from the hustle and bustle of the city.

It's definitely a must see when you're in Seoul. The entrance ticket is cheap and its more cheaper when you get the combo tickets for the 4 Palace. ,"May 14, 2016"
"It was crowded with both local and tourists when we visited. It was difficult to see all the sites in the rain as it was muddy between sites. Nevertheless, it was grand. It was however not my favourite. I prefer to walk around the secret garden at Changdeokgung.","May 14, 2016"
"The first day we went there was not actually a good experience because we were not aware that the palace was close on Tuesdays. It was disappointing but they let us visit the Palace Museum instead. The next day my sister and I still went positively hoping we could get in. And finally we did and for free! I was about to pay at the ticket booth when the lady told us that they were holding their National Culture Day and that admission was for free. Visiting Gyeongbukgung was on top of my list even before we arrived in Seoul. It was spring so the air was cool, cooler than the day before and we were glad about it. We took hundreds of pictures from the gates to the pots and stairs of the temple. It was like remembering all the Korean dramas I had watched before. But what I had realized was, I was setting foot on the same ground where kings and queens of Joseon walked and stood. It was a very happy experience!","May 13, 2016"

"Totally unintentionally we came to Seoul during the lantern festival. As a result we received full entry and were also offered an English tour by a group of school children (as part of a club activity). We took them up on their offer and were extremely glad we did. They took us around the palace, explaining to us a great deal about its history and cultural significance. The palace itself is very similar to many others and is still being reconstructed back to its former glory. However, the reconstruction is very realistic and it is possible to still gain a feel for its original significance. The gardens at the back allow strolls into the quieter regions of the palace providing a welcome break from the inevitable crowds.","May 13, 2016"
"Visiting the Palace is definitely a step back in time but the destruction wrought on it by Japanese forces at the time meant that little of the original structure remains. Still, the restoration work is excellent and walking the vast grounds is one of the most pleasant things to do in Seoul. Admission is about $3.00 however I strongly recommend you hire the audio guide for an additional $3.00. If you see Koreans wearing traditional dress walking around the Palace, many do so because they get free entry. I did note that there is good wheelchair access throughout the site but be prepared for a bumpy ride across the central courtyard.","May 12, 2016"
"great palace which has been rebuilt for may times. When I was there no so crowded so I was able to explore more, took some nice spot pictures. Affordable entrance fee with lot thing that can we expect","May 12, 2016"

A unique event.","May 12, 2016"
Went there on a weekend and it was extremely crowded. A lot of your groups all around. But it is still worth visiting to have a look and feel of KoreA's history. A few locals (I assume) wear their traditional clothing to walk around which made our visit a little more fun when we spot them. Managed to catch the guard changing ceremony and they are really very professional considering that these people are doing it to 'showcase' the history and not the 'real guards' from the past. ,"May 12, 2016"
"Had wonderful time there, the place is very well-maintained. It is quite big so I recommend to reserve at least 2 hours to enjoy all the little bits there. I also really liked almost one hour traditional music show there, no idea whether it is part of their normal schedule","May 12, 2016"
Second time to see the palace. Absolutely love it. I don't know much about Korean history but it is still well worth the visit. Admission is cheap. Very picturesque. Not grand and awe inspiring like Beijing's forbidden city but certainly more picturesque. Museum within the grounds worth a look as well. ,"May 12, 2016"

"I have visited this Palace during the Lantern Festival so it was free thus I cannot comment on the ticket pricex. It has the nicest localisation of the all Palaces as you can see beautiful green mountains in the backgroun. I'd say that if you have time to see only one, see this one.","May 9, 2016"
"We were approached by a free English speaking guide group at the train station who offered to take us through the palace and the grounds, we were hesitant at first but went ahead and found it very helpful and informative. The palace and private buildings of the royal family and officials were amazing and the palace grounds are massive, definitely a must see if ever in Seoul. Make sure you go on a clear day so you can get the best view of the palace. ","May 9, 2016"
