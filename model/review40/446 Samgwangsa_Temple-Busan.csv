Huge,"I didn't expect it to be so huge. Very well maintained, and very active, they had ceremonies in several halls at the same time. Great spot to do some hiking on the trails behind it. All in all, a very serene and beautiful place. Easy access too, bus 15 took us from Somyeon directly there."
Lantern Festival not to miss!,"This temple complex is very large and during the week or 2 before Buddha's Birthday extensive lanterns are hung and placed and it is jaw dropping amazing to see. Photos can hardly do it justice, but you will have wonderful photos to share. Do not wait until the actual day of Buddha's birth because the crowds are also gigantic. Come before sunset and watch as the lanterns are lit."
Very Colourful Temple,"Wasn’t expecting much when we reached destination but was wowed by the spectacular scenery. Weather was cool, view awesome, best of all free. Took lots of pretty photos but unable to post due is size of photos"

nice lantern though not lantern festival,Incidentally ran into this place...not a regret to have some nice shots..close proximity to city...relaxing
Samgwangsa Temple Lantern Festival (삼광사 연등축제,"attended Lantern festival (29 Apr-22 May) in evening. I followed directions on the Visit Korea website, took Seomyeon Station then waited for bus 15 for 30 mins. tired of waiting, so left on an alternate bus and ended up walking for 30 mins. it was crowded but worth the visit. huge temple and park i believe (didnt explore far from temple since it was dark) beautiful lanterns overhead on stairs to the temple. also had lantern sculptures."
Best temple in Busan- especially during the lantern festival,"I am not sure why this temple seems to be so underrated. It is much bigger and more elaborate than many of the other, more well know temples in the area. I love it here, one of my favourite spots in the city. The statues and carvings are amazing and there are some nice view both of the temple itself and looking back at the city. It is especially beautiful right now as it is coming up to the lantern festival and the entire temple complex is covered in lanterns. Absolutely stunning site to see. You can also hike maybe 30 mins to a smaller and more quaint temple- Seonamsa, from here. Also a nice place to visit, more relaxing and tranquil."
nice view,We went there a week before Buddha's birthday so the area is well decorated and picture perfect. The area also has proper signages for the tourists.
Buddhist Temple....,"One of the best temples we have visited so far. We visited in the early morning and liked the serene atmosphere to offer our prayer. Located at the base of a small hill, it is not far from Busan City Center. The view of the city from the Temple is fantastic on a clear day. The landscape and flowers are heart catching. It is open 24 hours. There is a latern festival every year during the month of April which lasts for a month; it is the best time to visit. From Seomyeon Metro Station exit 13 and take Mini Bus 81 or 133 which drops you at the temple.. The bus stop is in front of Holly's Coffee. Recommended while in Busan."
Nice temple," temple, busan, KoreaAfter trekking up the hill towards the start of the mountain and dark clouds over my head I headed straight up to the slope of a minders road to hill horizon. On that hill I found a monastery and heard on approach the chanting of a lone monk and the drum, banging at moments to awaken feelings of people inside, or that was the case. A beautiful collection of buildings matched in the colours of heavenly greens blues and the orcha colours of the earthy worlds governed by the laws of nature and time. In the distance and closer as I paced a pagoda with golden bells sounded off in the wind passing the sprit world and surrounded by folk figures I have only been able to view once I entered this land. On the wall had many reliefs of the gods and stories told by the faith of Buddhism and many more realistic impressions of flowers this land had come to known. The sun came out to greet me once I reached he main temple and as I went inside I saw people bowing their heads to the hard wooden floor, it thundered as movement went across it. Indeed it echoed in my mind and standing outside staring off the mountain into busan I felt the calm again, like a missing old friend I finally felt it again, I understood over the last few months I had been moving to fast and rapped up in my own pace that I rarely stopped to feel it again, but here it held me and let the clouds of my mind slip away.

Festival for Buddha's birthday,"It was our first experience of such event. We visited in the evening to look at all these lights. It was really beautiful, a lot of lanterns in different colors, atmosphere was amazing. You can get there by subway and then bus from seomeyon station. There is bus N15 direct to temple from bus stop somewhere near seomeyon, or several buses that stop nearby temple. But there was traffic jam since a lot of people were visiting and we ended going by foot on our way back to subway station it's about 3km away. Was nice night walk. "
A big temple,"Way much better than most of the temple I went with my family. Still, I couldn't get into the temple because of the stairs. Not wheelchair accessible. Had a lot of floats for the festival. "
Majestic structures and great view,"Samgwang Temple is one of the most outstanding and spectacular old temples in Korea, and certainly in Metro Busan. Perched high on a hillside next to a regional forest park, it offers both a great view of the city and the relaxing ambiance of the green surroundings (Children's Grand Park). Also, it's very elaborate with many buildings and various ongoing activities, including community services. A free lunch is provided especially for poverty-stricken elders at least once a week on Saturdays (1,000 won donation). It is the most spectacular in the days leading up to and on Buddha's Birthday. In fact, this is where the annual lantern parade takes place as part of the birthday celebrations."
Good view during Buddha birthday,"Due to I knew it's gonna be beautiful when the lantern lights is on, so, I went there in the evening, before dark and wandering till night, its getting crowded at night, but the view, the atmosphere is absolutely nice. You can do a bit of hiking up the hill, pack some food to have dinner there, the lantern art work is amazing, first time saw elephants lantern that their head and eye are mobile. Highly recommended to visit during this Buddha festival. "
Colorful lanterns,I visited this temple in April near a Buddhist celebration which would be held on May. There were colorful lanterns everywhere. The people will purchase it to make good wish. It was a beautiful sight. 
A beautiful but busy temple,"This temple is best view on Buddha's Birthday in May. However it is also the most busiest time for the temple. It literally gets hundreds of people visiting to see the lanterns. However, it is worth the view. The best time to go is just before the evening starts as you get to see the lights and the surrounding views."
