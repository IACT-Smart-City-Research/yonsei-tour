Great Place To Stay,Pyeongchon Station area is great because everything is nearby! I like the food offered at the Prime Buffet International Restaurant although it is a bit pricey. The park is very nice for you to visit on Saturdays because there is a flea market of second hand goods from the residents. You can also view the fountains and stroll along the park in the evening.
