Great in all weathers!,We stayed on a hotel overlooking the beach and we loved the beach itself and the whole area. Lots of restaurants and bars to choose from and a wonderful beach to stroll along- plus the convenience of the compressed air pumps to clean the sand off your shoes afterwards.
Spectacular lights and fireworks,"We visited this beach early in October, and it was very lively and so full of lights. The view of he Diamond Bridge all lighted up was spectacular. There were also many concerts and live performances going on at the beach. We also saw fireworks - beautiful place to be at night. I doubt it will look so interesting and good during daytime. Plenty of restaurants and bars around for dinner. We thoroughly enjoyed our night visit here to the ebach. Highly recommended!!!"
Great to stroll ,"This beach to great to come to, to stroll around and there are plently of restaurants to choose from "
Night view,"Came in the evening, Gwangandaegyo Bridge night view is beautiful. I suggest come before sunset and stay til early evening."
Nice stroll,Take Line 2 to Gwangan Station and walk from Exit 5.Turn right and walk for 5 minutes down 7 blocks to arrive at Gwangalli Beach.Perfect for a day out at the beach
Wow,"Lovely fees and clean, nearby restaurant and coffee shop, with sea view. Would have like to spend more time here"
Perfect View from the Beach,"The sun sets perfectly well at Gwangalli Beach giving you a beautiful reason to end the day. The view from the beach is breathtaking. Too bad, South Korea seems to have a litter problem where there are literally litter at most popular tourists beaches. If not for the litter, it will be a great beach to visit. "
Lovely in the night..,"Best time to go is late afternoon/sunset and evening.There are a lot of shops, restaurants and nightclubs all around.Here you can often find shows in the street, like outdoor theater!Beautiful and young atmosphere!One of my favourite place in Busan."
Nice beach,"you can easily reach that beach by taxi. It is a free beach access with the chance to rent a sunbed and a parasole (10,000 each). Nice sandy beach and more quite that Haeundae beach"
Not bad for swimming but very nice for night walking ,"It was crazy crowded and water wasn‚Äôt clean. I didn‚Äôt get why it is one of the famous beaches. Whatever... I didn‚Äôt like swimming but there were so many sea shells. If you like collecting them, it is good place. Especially if you have children ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è We liked being there night time. There were so many street musicians, gwangan bridge was very nice. There were so many restaurants, pubs. So you can enjoy your dinner by watching sea, bridge, people crossing by"
Happening,Went there on a Sat evening and it is so lively and happenings. Groups of performances around and so many people there. Went there to watch the light up of bridge too
Visit Gwangalli at night,"Gwangalli Beach is famous for night time visit, because there are good restaurants and you can see Gawngan Bridge lights decoration. It is very safe to walk around. "
The sea is filthy dirty,"I appreciate there has been a typhoon recently, but there is no excuse for the authorities not to do everything in their powers to clean the sea where bathers swim. The sea was disgusting, being full of plastic and other garbage. It's a shame because the beach and the surrounding cafes and bars are great."
Great Beach Area,"Didn't make it during the day, so not sure how water temp/cleanliness is. But definitely smaller waves and quieter than Haeundae beach. We went on a Sunday night, and there was still a lively market along the beach, a show on Gwangandaegyo bridge, and they closed off a main road for some fun, games, and entertainment. Overall, very nice fun spot. Worth visiting if Haeundae is too packed."
Well this is just a perfect loud and vibrant place,"Full of restaurants and cafes that stay open until late cramped with young people. Go, enjoy the incredible view of the bridge and have fun walking or playing at the beach. "
Less crowded than Haeundae Beach,"This beach is the perfect place to relax. Haeundae Beach is usually more popular and well known however, I find that beach is so much more crowded and doesn't have nearly as a nice of a view as Gwangalli Beach. There are umbrellas that you can pay to rent and sit under, or you could just lie on the beach without one."
An in-town beach ,"My hotel host recommended me to check out this beach at night. It is certainly really interesting in the evening when you can see the Gwangali bridge lighted up, but the area also is thriving with people and there are a huge community of bars and restaurants around. Even if you are not swimming, it is a nice place to hang out in the evening. During day time, the walk on the edge of the bridge all the way towards Millak side direction is highly recommended. Nice stretch of walk where you can walk right up next to the water. In fact, you can walk all the way along the water front to Centum City to catch your shopping or check out Spaland. It may take 40 minutes of slow walking from beach to Centum. I prefer this beach to Haeundae Beach because it seems to have more personalities. Not a typical beach. "
A lovely & clean city beach with night lights,"I wish we had more time here. It was lovely walking around here after dinner enjoying the sea breeze and the beautiful night lights from the bridge and surrounding buildings. It‚Äôs a clean and very well maintained beach and what is even more enjoyable is, it wasn‚Äôt crowded at all. There are plenty of cafes, shops and restaurants that open late along the beach. Come here for a relaxing evening. "
Bridge with a light show!,"We were here before sunset and stood on the nice sandy beach and looking at the long bridge. The bridge is lighted up after sunset. At 8pm, there was a 10-minute beautiful light show. Don't miss it! There was another one at 9pm. Check out the time of the show at the information counter. "
Nice view,"Better than Haeundae just because of the bridge view. Lots of cafes as expected. I went during the week and it was pretty tranquil, better than expected anyway. Take some nice photos with the bridge in the background."
Day and night ,"Lovely little beach to go see day or night. During the day, there is a lot of places to enjoy the beach. At night, it is the perfect place to sit and enjoy the light show of the bridge. "
Recommended,We took the Metro to Centrum Station and after seeing all the sights in the area decided to walk along to the beach area which we really enjoyed. A lovely beach. We didn‚Äôt stay on to see the bridge lit up which we later regretted.
Beautiful beach,"We went to Gwangalli Beach at about 5pm so that I get to capture the view in daylight and after sunset. There are lots of shops in the area and we went for a wonderful seafood dinner to help kill time. You cannot see the sun setting as the beach faces east, however, the transition from day to night is quite mesmerising. Hope you like the pictures."
Nice place,"Lots of people visit here, but almost of them are Korean. Some came here with their children, some came with their lover, some came with their dogs and some came alone. "
Disappointing,I will say this place was really disappointing. Went for the bridge lights display and it was really underwhelming.
nice beach,nice beach with plenty of eateries all over and a great walk way with some pic spots for creting memories
Beautiful and well kept,Went to look at the lights display the the beach. Beach is clean but too cold to stay there. Many beach front restaurants and coffee places I think will be wonderful place to chill in summer time.
Must go!!,Best view all day.... such a romantic place where a lot of couples come. You can run along the beach. Allow for pet
Best beach in Busan,"I stayed at Haeundae beach, but Gwangalli beach has a more vibrant feel and much better view, with offshore islands and a spectacular bridge."
Great ambiance and restaurants,"Strolling along the beach, enjoying spectacular view of The Bridge during daytime and beautifully illuminated once darkness falls."
Busan,We visited the Beach during the day and then as part of Night tour of the city the bridge at night is spectacular and the light reflecting on the ocean beautiful. Visiting in winter might not be the best time.
Amazing Beach Date Spot for young couples!!,"If you‚Äôre into live music, clubs, bars, modern restaurants, or beautiful night beaches; you must visit Gwangalli Beach which is a ~40 minute train ride from Busan. This beautiful beach overlooks the lit up bridge at night and provides relief from the hectic city life. There‚Äôs literally a live talented musician singing on every other block on the beach. This is the perfect date spot as there‚Äôs multiple restaurants and bar at the beach front without the bougie cost. One could easily spend half a day here and I strongly recommend to visit during the evening/night."
Go there by night!,We recommend it at night! We are charmed by the whole city but it's hard to find a second place with such tall and illuminated buildings that throw light into water in the evenings! it gives a great effect! Just great! I recommend especially for a spontaneous date! Believe the Partner will appreciate it!
Very nice beach,We love going to this beach VERY CLEAN. Great beach! Nice coffee shops and restaurants next to the waterfront. Night time the bridge lights up and amateur talent lines the boardwalk. 
LIKEüòä,"It was Spring 2018, I took the subway and got to Gwangali with ease...it was chilly but a bright day. The lovely beachfront was lively and friendly. Liked the relaxing local vibe.The open air concert was uplifting. By night, the bluesky beachfront view turned to a gentle glittering seaview framing the elegant bridge...such a great view for korean seafood dinner, followed by coffee with luscious chocolate roll at Molly's. Ps Do explore the surrounding residential neighborhood-its interesting n pretty cosy."
Best Looking City Beach,A very pretty beach with an amazing view of a gorgeous bridge. I highly recommend arriving at dusk and just appreciating the lights of the bridge becoming brighter as the sun goes down. Plenty of restaurants along the waterfront mean you can appreciate the beach and its view without getting sand in everything
Gwangalli beach,It is beautiful even in winter. It is definitely a must see for Busan. You can enjoy the restaurants and pubs close to this location.
Beautiful beach with great views ,Gwangali beach is a stunning beach in Busan. Great views and lots of good eateries nearby. The bridge is definitely worth viewing! 
A beautiful beach,"A very nice and clean beach in Busan. Not as crowded as Haeundae and it even has a separate surfer, paddleboard, boogie board area on the far southwest side of the beach. Rentals boards and classes are available. "
Clean Beach with Fine sand,"A local favorite, this beach has much to offer other than its fine sand, as it is surrounded by restaurants, cafes and shopping complexes. One of the most sought after weekend destination of Busan, one can also have a spectacular view of the Gwangandaegyo Bridge in the evening."
Lovely stroll,"Even though it was fall season, it was a nice stroll along the beach. Air guns stations were strategically situated along the beach to blast away any debris collected by visitors‚Äô shoes. The view of the famous bridge was not as spectacular as in the night. In summer, this beach must be packed and crowded. "
Night Life and Lights,"While it‚Äôs not the most famous beach in Busan, it is a must see destination. It‚Äôs a wide, sandy beach with very small waves. In the summer months you can enjoy jet ski rentals or go out for a sail. The food choices are mostly non-Korean. The night view of the Gwangan Bridge is worth waiting around for as are the lights of of the nearby Marine City skyscrapers. If you‚Äôre ready for a change from Korean food I would highly recommend SOL Taphouse for authentic NY Pizza and a cold Brooklyn Lager."
Clean beach,Very clean beach. Little umbrellas are present to shelter you from the sun. Water was too cold to enter. There's nothing much else to do. 
Really pretty,"One of busan must go place. Many to see, to eat, too explore . Recommend ‚Äúhotel 1‚Äù to see the best of the beach. "
Lovely night view ,Enjoy the lighted bridge with sea breeze and buskers singing along the beach. There are many cafes and stores lined up as well! Must go ;)
Gwangalli beach and diamond bridge view,"Go to this place to view the Diamond bridge lighting show in the evening. It is a good view from the beach - how the lighting changes. Next to the beach, there are many shopping centers."
The lights at the bridge,Has a good view and a whole lot of restaurants and coffee shops around if you want to stay for the sunset and the light show at the bridge. The only difficulty I had was that you had to walk a couple of blocks for the bus station and subway if you are commuting but it will be worth it.They also offer wind sailing if you want to come closer to the bridge and have your own party. One of the best beach attractions in Busan. 
visual overkill,"imagine a very beautiful sandy beach and try to skip the pictures of all the grey skyscrapers in the back. just focus on the beach. walk towards the water and take a closer look:a bronze whale, cut in half. two statues of dolphins in the sundown. a cablecar. a giant turtle.the beach.not enough? take a few steps on the skywalk. a meermaid. hatched eggs. shores like in scandinavia. still a cablecar. chopped-off trees (no worries, artificial) on these shores. mine-shaped art in the water.welcome!"
Great Beach and a even better place to be at night.,"Anywhere else in the worlk and this beach would be filled with sunbathers. However, being in Asia, where most asians cover their skin at all costs so not to tan, the beach is mostly empty. However, it is at night when the night life really picks up with its variety of restaurants, bars and vendors. Strolling along the beach walk you can listen to karoake on the beach ofr watch various performers aor you can just sit and watch the light displays on the Gwangandaegyo Bridge."
Delicious Authentic Indian food.,Loved loved this restaurant. This is an authentic Indian restaurant. Service amazing! I was impressed with the service and the quality of food. Great music and even accepted our dog into the restaurant!
Shooting Area,"This beach is the fave place for kpop idols and actors to go! There are several music videos, and varieties shoot here."
More like haeundae beach,A beach with restaurants and good for walking and enjoying the city view ...live area beautiful lights in the night 
Great way to end the day,"Choose from the many bars along the beach to have a drink and enjoy the view. Many people strolling along the beach, some spots with light and wide enough for people to sit and take in the sights."
One night at Gwangalli Beach,"My family and I were here just after 8pm onwards to enjoy the night scenery of the 1.4 km Gwangalli Beach (about the same length as Haeundae Beach) and of course the Gwangandaegyo Bridge. Getting there: Take the Line 2 (Green Line) metro to Geumnyeosan Station. Upon exiting Exit 3, turn right onto Namcheonbada-ro and walk straight for about 15 minutes. Cross the busy Gwanganhaebyeon-ro and Gwangalli Beach is in front of you. The Beach at night: The beach atmosphere appeared to be vibrant as there was a concert that just ended at 8pm. Along with countless visitors, we enjoyed the changing display of lights of the Gwangandaegyo Bridge across the sea. In the beginning of the ‚Äúlight show‚Äù, there were words displayed on the bridge but later, there was only repeated sequence of different colour lights and their movement. The reflection of lights of the beachfront buildings to the left and right of Gwangalli Beach on the sea was also nice (you could not see the mirror images of the buildings because the sea was not still). To take night photography, you may need a camera with long exposure capability and a tripod. A few visitors launched mini- fireworks but these weren‚Äôt spectacular enough. As you walk along the beach, be mindful of the high tide at night where the waves may suddenly catch you off-guard. In fact the high tide actually swept beyond the shelters (umbrellas).I think this is a lovely experience of seeing a bridge with changing light display from the beach. To complete the experience, it will be great to visit Gwangalli Beach in the day too."
Happy hour!,Need to go in the end of the day!! Great bridge view and a lot of bars to drink some wine or beers at the beach line!
Favorite beach in Korea,Gwangalli Beach is definitely my favorite beach in Korea. I enjoy paddle boarding with CrazySurfers and all the restaurants and bars in the evening/night. Great place for a chill social night out!
Urban beach vibe that is totally enjoyable,"Gwangalli Beach is one of the more popular beaches in Busan, with its signature feature being the colourful bridge by the horizon. We took the internet's advice and visited the beach at night and we were completely mesmerized by the sight of the place.There are many drinking places facing the beach and the bridge's lights will sometimes perform a show, making Gwangalli an ideal place to chill out with friends at night, especially if you're a fan of lights, beach and alcohol. But if you don't like getting drunk, you can also find eating places and cafes too.The beach is almost as busy as Hauende Beach and this beach gives off a more urban vibe than Hauende. Still, I enjoyed both equally.Really loved the experience here and should definitely visit at night."
Quieter i comparison with Hauendae,"Another beach. Hauendae to me is a better place but if you have time and love beach, why not? Evening stroll on the beach after sunset may not be that bad."
Pretty awesome way to spend an afternoon,Beautiful beach with a lot of street performers and good restaurants along the way. Go find some live octopus nearby..if that's what you're into ;)
Nice Evening Stroll if you are nearby,"Only if If you are in the vicinity, do stop by the beach in the evening for a nice stroll. Many people playing and enjoying the breeze. It is a dog friendly place with many Koreans bringing their pooches for walks. There is a light show at 8pm lasting about 20 mins. Don't expect too much from it other than some play of lights on the bridge. The best place to view the show is right in the center where there is also a laser beaming some light effect across a spray of water just on the beach to complement the lights on the bridge. "
Gwangalli ,"Very nice place for tourists and those who love night life.. Here is the bridge from ""Black Panther"" movie. Very atmospheric place."
Great night view,Came here at night to view the Gwangan bridge lights up. It‚Äôs fantastic! A nice place for couples and families to hang out and enjoy the cool Breeze and sight.
Beautiful city beach,"If it was not for the set up of something that must have been a festival kind of thing, this beach is the perfect hangout for a lazy day. Busan is well known for their many beaches and this one is one of the better ones. "
Funniest Beach of Busan,"This place is a good hub because you can hang out at night around all the bars and nice restaurants, and skyline view. Its perfect.You can reach downtown quickly too (seomyeong or even fish market, Gamcheon)But during the day the beach/sea is not as good as Haeundae or event Songjeong Beach.So I advice to get a hotel there for younger people that wants to hang out because all the bars are alongside the beach, But also its really convenient to move around the city knowing that its a massive city. so everybody would probably enjoy it.Except the ones that wants a more quiet beach at night.You can reach Haeundae in 15mn by taxi or 30mn by metro, Count double the time for Songjeong but its very quiet other there.20/30 min metro to SemeyongFew stations to BEXCO and the biggest mall"
"Another bridge, with lights",To a chance and went to Gwangalli beach to catch the lights on the bridge. Didn't see any good food and settled for coffee and cakes at Pascucci. The views offered from its 3rd floor was amazing. In the end the bridge was a letdown and the beach was average. 
Please don‚Äôt miss it!,"What a place!..... calm strolling, or swimming, or windsurfing, or enjoying a coffee with a view, or some fun dinning with a view, or a quite walk along the beach, or traditional korean food dinning and drinking, or pub-ing .... all this and more is possible at this place, while you enjoy of a tranquil environment and korean neon lights.... wonderful"
Nice night view,Very vibrant lights and buzzing with night life. Nice lights from Gwangali bridge. Would be good if we had more time to explore.
Nice and breezy,"Nice beach.Nice scenery.Lots of food outlets along the street.You will also get to see the famous bridge from anywhere along the beach.At night, buskers are almost at every corner and they are really good singers. Also caricature artists."
Scenic,Nice and clean beach with interesting shops & restaurants linning all along. It becomes very lively later in the evenings with crowd thronging oin the beach as also on the stree above it
Pleasant beach,"It's very pleasant place, especially in the evening with the lights on over the bridge. There are plenty of restaurants on the beach side road offering tons of options to choose from. Make sure to be there after it gets dark, to enjoy the views of the bridge."
A good strip of beach,"WE stopped here to lie on the beach for a while and then got a beer at one of the many places in the bay. OK for a quick visit, but not particularly memorable. Haeundae Beach around the corner is much better"
Very Scenic,This is a better beach compared to Haeundae as it is not over crowded. You can see the longest bridge from the beach and it has very nice sunset view. Splendid!
Nice evening walk,Great view of the Gwangan bridge at night. Lots of eateries along the main road next to the beach: this area seemed to me especially popular with the young Koreans. Very pleasant walk in the evening.
Gwangalli Beach/Gwangandaegyo Bridge,nice beach with view of Gwangandaegyo bridge. there are tiki umbrellas and surf lessons on the beach. the sidewalk by beach has some artwork. alot of shops/hotels across the street of beach.
"Gwangalli beach, Busan",Very busy beach with a lot of restaurants and bars . Fine sand.Some nice artwork along the promenade and view of Gwangan bridge.Close to the center of Busan.
Better for night view,"Smaller than other beaches in Busan, reachable from Gwangan metro station. A lot of people go there in the evening to view the bridge lit in front of the beach. Shops, cafes, festivals. There was no laser show when I went."
Recommend to use public transportation,"If you plan to visit Gwangalli Beach, I highly recommend to use public transportation. Do not take your car. IT's really hard to find a parking spot around the beach. It's also very crowded and boisterous place, but walking along the beach was an quite enjoyable experience. Cool seawind :)"
"Nice beach, with shops and cafes. Not so busy as Haeundae but just as nice.","We stayed at the Hound Hotel that is on the beach, it's just a 20 second walk around the corner from the hotel. It is a nice stretch that goes on for miles. You can walk or bike the whole thing. There are shops, cafes, and restaurants all along the walk. They do close earlier in this part of town, usually closed by 9PM, it is a slower part of town and really a nice area to stay in. There is a great view of the Gwangalli Bridge at night with all its lights. There are some really good Korean restaurants in the alley ways across the major road where the metro stop is. Some great Japanese style sushi to be found as well as Korean seafood restaurants. "
beautiful beach and lighted bridge,we stayed in a Airbnb one block from the beach with views of the beach and lighted bridge. the beach is lined with eateries of all types. It was difficult to determine where to eat so we asked our host for recommendations. We ended up eating at a place who specialized in clams about a block inside of the beach strip. The food was great and the price was not bad. We did not really check out the area too much as we had a bucket list of things to see in Busan and was out all day and night. 
Nice view in busan ,"A good place to enjoy the sunset . Many restaurants around the beach , easy to find something to eat . Good place to chill "
Stroll along the beach,"Of course, strolling along a beach in February might not the typical time. Anyway, we liked the beach and the surrounding multiple choice of restaurants, coffee shops, pubs and shops. We will be back im summer! "
Gorgeous with the view of the Gwangandaegyo Bridge especially at night,"There are so many restaurants around the area. Walk around to discover places. During the Spring, visit the Cherry Blossom Street several blocks away. "
OK beach,"Not as chilled as Haeundae beach but interesting view of the bridge and backed by lots of cafes, coffee shops etc. I was there in march and they had parasols out already."
Great view,Nice beach with great view. It's cold now but it's also worth a visit. Staying at the nearby beach will be great advantage. During the night there are many cafes restaurants or bars around the beach. 
Really nice!,"One of the two most famous beaches in Busan. It holds the Busan firework festival. At night (especially during weekends) it is a party heaven. You can have a long tour from bar to bar or just drink and party at the beach :) During the day it's a fantastic place to rejuvenate yourself after that party fever ;) Around, there are a lot of good places to have a brunch or dinner (Butcher's Burger being on the top of the list). Of course there are a lot of hotels/motels nearby so that makes it a really good place for a weekend stay in Busan. You can definitely recharge your batteries there!"
Beautiful ,"Beautiful sandy beach with fantastic views and lots of restaurants, bars, and cafes along the boardwalk."
Evening stroll of blinking lights and BBQ smell,"Located 10min walk from the Gwangan metro station, we decided to look for dinner along the beach and the area has an abundance of Korean BBQ joints and bars. The area has a nice slow paced relaxed feel. During our visit, Busan was setting up the area for their annual fireworks festival. No doubt in the warmer months, this beach would be crowded."
Nice little beach,"It‚Äôs a small nice beach that provides a great location for your photos. Diamond bridge is just accross you. Line 2- gwangan station - exit 3,5 - walk 7-8 minutes"
Night view in Busan,"about 1 km. from Gwangalli station, you can walk or travel by bus no.83,38. the Gwangalli bridge is little shine in night sea. "
Nice View and Refreshing,Nice View in the Evening. So many cottage and restaurant around which have beach view. You can go without shoes to feel the sea sand and wave.
Nice place to chill,"I went here with my friends at night. It was in the early November and it's quite cold. It was nice to hang out at the beach looking at all the lamps and hearing the voice of street performance. Anytime you need a warm place and a hot choc or coffee, you can just enter the coffee shop as there are a lot of them."
Came for Sunset,We came on Christmas Day. Took Bus 1003 from the Gamcheon Culture Village. We came right around sunset and it was pretty crowded with people who had the same idea. It's a nice area to take pictures of the Gwangandaegyo Bridge (Korea's longest suspension bridge).
Gwangalli Beach,"Stayed in an Airbnb house near the beach and the house offers a beautiful view of the Gwangan Bridge. At night, there‚Äôs a light show at the bridge. It‚Äôs also a great place to catch sunset and sunrise too! "
very cool,"I've been to many beaches in my time, but none like this. It has a very cool view of the bridge and city. There are a bunch of different restaurants and bars in the area as well. Next time I visit Busan I would stay at this beach in stead of Haeundae."
Good Views at Night,We visited this place during the fall season. We came by at night and it was beautiful because of the view you get of the Gwangandaegyo Bridge. It's a good place to stroll around. There are also a lots bars and restaurants around.
Serene beach with a beautiful view,Very clean beach with calm clear water. The bridge over the sea is beautifully lit at night and provides an excellent view.
Nice beach place but nothing extraordinary......,"We went in the night. From the subway, you need to walk about 15 minutes. Along the way on both sides of the road are endless rows of shops, cafes & restaurants.Facing directly across beach are hordes of cafes, restaurants, hotels & motels. Obviously a tourists' area.The beach is quite small. There wasn't any activity on. The beautiful lights of many buildings stands out prominently in the dark background. The lighted bridge looked great.It's a nice place but really, nothing extraordinary."
"Lovely beach, big and clean. And a fabulous firework festival","Gwangalli is a lovely beach to just hang out on. You can also rent surf boards if you like. Surrounding the beach you have a lot of cafes and restaurants, and if you want to go out fr drinks you have a good selection of bars and pubs as well. And in October you can experience the fantastic firework festival, well worth the trip!"
Busan International Firework Festival 2017,"Busan International Firework Festival takes place every October along Gwangalli beach.The festival's diverse programs of cultural events,high-tech laser light shows,and myriad of unique and colorful fireworks make this one of the area's most popular festival's, drawing crowds of over 1 million visitors each year."
Did not see any light ‚Äúshow‚Äù per se. Just a lit bridge.,Did not see any light ‚Äúshow‚Äù per se. Just a lit bridge. Eateries around the area more for groups/ sharing. 
Gwangalli Beach - Busan's Hidden Jewel,"Gwangalli beach is an amazing place that doesn't get enough recognition when compared with its ""sister"" Haeundae Beach. Visited both places and Gwangalli will always hold a special place in my heart. Gwangalli Beach is full of life so you will always find something to do/ see/ eat. Not to mention safe.You have lots of restaurants, arcade shops, cute coffee shops, convenience stores, bakeries and I even found a nice place at one end of the beach where I could eat a delicious Bingsu. If you want to go to the beach and don't know what to wear, do not worry. Whether you use a bikini or a swimsuit its all good. Even if you are surrounded by people enjoying the beach almost fully clothed. If you think you will feel a bit awkward just wear shorts and a t-shirt or simply a t-shirt over your bikini. Or you can do like the locals. Your call, really.If you have kids with you, do not worry. There are lifeguards stations along the beach and they are very vigilant and always ready to pull someone out of the water or tell them to stop if they engage in more enthusiastic activities.You pay to use the beach parasols and floaties on the beach, unless you bring your own. If you do bring one, they have near every beach ‚Äúentrance‚Äù, usually near the stairs and showers a place for you to fill it up. If you think that Gwangalli's Beach liveliness calms down at night you are totally mistaken. On Friday night, the main road near the Tourist Office will be closed so that people can play board games and not only with their friends, family or even with other people that just decided to give it a try just for the fun of it. You will also see along the road concerts, people dancing in and out of stage (we saw a Tango dancing contest), lots of younger people showcasing their talents through dance/ singing alongside the beach, mime artists and so on. If you simply want to relax, you can buy some fried chicken (or whatever you fancy the most) and some drinks and sit on the beach like so many people do. Take your time and enjoy the view when Gwangan Bridge (a.k.a. Diamond Bridge) lights up rhythmically at the sound of music every hour.If you prefer, you can even rent a boat for your own enjoyment as long you are prepared to row it yourself.My child and I were always going out at night for beach walks along the sea. The warmth of the water combined with the atmosphere surrounding us was amazing.People in Busan are really nice and kind even more so with tourists so just relax and enjoy.You can get to Gwangalli Beach by subway. Just exit at Gwangan Station, Exit 5 and then go down the street until you reach the beach. You will find indications along the way on the floor like the one in the photo I've uploaded and some maps near bus stops indicating you where you are."
Night visit,This is a really good spot for ending a touristic day. You can buy your wine (or soju due were talking about Korea) and just sit in the sand to watch the bridge from the beach. Is a really nice view to relax and talk with friends 
Convenient but mediocre,"It was a good place to take a look of gwangan bridge, but still I don't recommend to visit here during summer time because the festival is going to bring tourist here. It's pretty convenient there, restaurants and subway are near the neighborhood."
Great evening destination,"I lived in this neighborhood in the late 1990s and it's nothing like it was then. The beach is beautiful and a great place to be during the day, but the night life is vibrant and dynamic too. There's a good selection of restaurants and it's a great place to stroll. The restaurants are pricer than less touristy parts of the city. The bridge lists up on the hour."
Beautiful Night View,"Haeundae Beach is well known to domestic and foreign visitors. Likewise, Gwangalli Beach is also beautiful and has an amazing view. Even though its size is smaller than Haeundae Beach, I think its view and atmosphere is better than the other. In particular, its night view is amazing. If you have a plan to visit Busan, don't miss it!"
finally at the sea,"I wasn't in the sea for a long time, so I liked it. Quite a nice to beach to chill even when the weather wasn't that good as I would wish."
Great on warm day,Lovely clean beach with plenty ogf dinning options esp.sahsimi.Hop on bus stops here or cab from Busan $10.
Lovely Beach!,"Was not sure what to expect out of a beach in Korea but was pleasantly surprised! We had great sunny weather and loved just walking along the shore, seeing people enjoy with their families. Overlooking the bridge you can get some pretty neat shots. Watch out though as you'll have to pay to use the shelters/umbrellas on the beach - someone should be coming around to collect the fees. In the night this places transforms into another era. The beach was packed with families and friends just enjoying the cool night, taking photos. There were buskers, a small flea market and the whole place was just bustling with activities. Loved the atmosphere!"
 Nice Beach,"This was told to us to be more of the local beach. Really nice peaceful and quiet. There were good restaurants along the beachfront street. The bridge lights up at night adding a nice aura to the venue. If you want a calmer quiet beach, this is your place. "
Sushi in Gwangalli,"Good sushi at good price. We enjoyed it al lot. When we visit Busan again, we will visit this place again."
A beach with a view,"WE took metro line 2 and stopped at Gwangan station. We used exit 3 and walked for about 15 mins to reach the beach in the late afternoon, just before sunset. The beach was okay, not too big and not as famous as Haeundae beach. However, you can view the Gwangan bridge directly opposite the beach. Best to stay until night and view the lights on Gwangan bridge after dark if you can. We didn't stay, so we missed the lights. Plenty of shops near the beach."
Be sure to check the weather condition before visiting the beach,We visit the beach during 31 Aug and found the beach is too windy with sand blowing around. The beach is not as spacious as Haeundae and it is too close to the driveway and cafe. There is no wind break nor any place to hind from the wind and the experience is so bad.
"Not very nice, quite downmarket","Nothing special here and not so easy to reach - quite a walk from both the 2 closest subway stations.Not very pretty and with lots of cheap drink/ eating place. Guess it is ok for early twenty something backpackers, but not so good for anyone else. The bridge at night is just ok, not an amazing picture opportunity, but the skyline towards Haeundae beach is slightly better to photograph."
"Busy Area, nice place","Was there to watch the ""Lights at the Gwangalli Bridge"". Actually lighting effect was not impressive at all.... There's plenty of shops across the beach, we walks around for a while, and left the area after a short while. I guess it would be good area to stay, looking towards the bridge and sea, enjoy the seaside environment"
"Clean beach, great view at night","We got there a few minutes before sunset, so we passed time in one of the many restaurants nearby. Paris Baguette is just across the street from the beach, perfect place to hang out while waiting for the sun to set. The beach was clean and not crowded as we went tail end of winter, only downside is that were freezing! Quite a walk from the train station but not too bad."
Beautiful night scene with many nice restaurants,The lighted bridge was spectacular at night. There were restaurants of all sorts alongside the beach. The sandy beach itself was clean and enjoyable.
Great nightlife over the weekend!,"We visited over a weekend, with the main purpose of viewing the night lights/lights show on the Gwangan Bridge and was pleasantly surprised to see so many activities taking place at the beach. There were street performances, a flea market, kids activities and even tables set up for families to play games. Loved the atmosphere!"
a nice romantic beach,"Gwangalli Beach, or Gwangan Beach is a beach in Busan located on the bay overlooking Gwangan Bridge. This is the site for sailing events in the 1988 Summer Olympics. They say that this beach isn‚Äôt as popular as Haeundae, but I can‚Äôt tell the difference. There were still loads of people here. In fact, I find Gwangalli a much more happening spot as the beach is surrounded by waterfront cafes and restaurants. At the edge of the waterfront on Gwangalli, you'll find the common sight of fishing rods casting their bait into the sea.Rock formations just off the Gwangalli waterfront. Look closely at the crashing waves and you might just catch a small statue of one man standing against the sea. Never yielding, unmovable, it stands against the current, against the crashing waves, against the winds, his sight fixed upon the horizon."
Even Great at Night,"I was staying the night at Haeundae Grand Hotel and ran as fast as I could to this beach because who wouldn't want to? Right? Even at night it wasn't as crowded as I expected it to be since this whole strip of a street is nothing but hotels, bar scenes, and coffee shops. So I was expecting a lot of tourists.Maybe it was because it was a week night and not a weekend? I have no idea but I found my excursion to be relaxing and welcoming. Pretty serene and calming too. I came around 9pm-ish but I felt safe. I didn't run into any crazy or loud people so it was perfectly relaxing. So swing on by if you're staying nearby any of the hotels. I'm sure it's great in the day but it was pretty great even at night. Enjoy!"
Excellent,"It s in the things to do list. If you have a choice Haeundae or Gwangalli , if you are liking not so foreigner place you must be visit there."
Interesting Beach,Long and beautiful. The view from this site is great. You can see the outstanding and stunning Gwangandaegyo Bridge along the beach. Visiting the beach in the late afternoon until night is recommended.
Great place for a little sunbathing,"This is a nice city beach for a bit of sunbathing. It is easily accessed by metro. The view is a iconic bridge, so it is not a open sea beach.It was not very crowded on weekdays. You can rent a parasol for 5k, but you can also just lay in the sun."
Loved the beach ,"Loved Gwangalli beach - I went in early June abd although I did not swim because it was too cold..I enjoyed strolling down the beach. It was not that busy; I felt comfortable. There are plenty og great restaurants just acrosd the street overlooking the beach and the bridge. Had great seafood dinner at one of them. Afterwards I returned back to the beach for an evening stroll - enjoyed looking at the brigde that changed into pastel colors. There were also musicians playing on various instruments and other sorts of local entertainment such as a magician. Unfortunstely my hotel was a long taxi ride away, next time I will book a hotel by the beach as I really enjoyed the Gwangalli Beach area."
Long and Gorgeous,Beautiful beach with great view. Quieter than Haeundae and tons of restaurants to enjoy! Great for a long walk any time of day! Love the early quiet morning or the dark night with the sparkling lights!
Good view at night of the Gwangalli Bridge lights,"Not impressed with the beach during the day when seen from the BUTI bus. But instead of paying 15000won each for their evening bus we paid 1300 each way on 41 bus from Busan station and sat outside at a restaurant overlooking the bridge for the evening. Lights were ok but we were expecting something more special. At 21.00 on the Sunday night the beach road was shut and street performers take over. Really lovely atmosphere. White statues posing for photos,live music and a really good puppeteer who draw a portrait of a child and a memorable rendition of Gangam style by a dark glasses puppet. Weren't sure of final bus so left at 22.45 still going strong. Good night out"
Iconic Beach,"Gwangalli and Haeundae are two famous beaches in Busan. Gwangalli especially has its uniqueness with Gwangan Daegyo bridge in the view. Same with Haeundae, the beach surrounded by hotels, cafes, bars, and restaurants. Small night concerts and performances, and free movie screening also available here. It is quite difficult to distinguish the difference about what kind of beach activities you could do in Haeundae and Gwangalli since they located in not-so-far distance and offer almost same features of activities. But I think Haeundae offers you better choices since the summer festivals often held in Haeundae. Gwangan Daegyo is the point of Gwangalli."
Nice beach,"It is a decent beach but not fantastic. However, it a good change compare to other places in the city. But the beach looks dirty as i overlooked from the hotel i stayed. So i only walked on the beach and did not swim."
Really nice place!,Gwangalli Beach is nice place for night life people. Many people have their performances close beach which make it more interesting. Sometimes there are events organized by town and it is really interesting to watch or even take a part of it. What is also great in there - view for a bridge! :) You can just go at any bar/restaurant and sit close window and look at bridge with change lighting!
Nice View,"Nice view- you can see the lighted Gwangalli Bridge from the beach at night! Many young talent will be singing at the beach so enjoy their singing, sea breeze and the beautiful view of the Bridge. There are many restaurants and cafe along the beach. "
Busan's Best Beach,"In my experience, Gwangalli is the best. It's the most peaceful, least crowded, and best for taking a walk along the water. There are restaurants and convenience stores just across the street, which is also convenient. It also has a fantastic view at night! It's my favorite night view in Busan."
Fun Beach at Night!,"Movies on the beach, plenty of shopping opportunities and fireworks on the beach make this a great stop for the evening. The lights on the bridge are cool and many Koreans use this site to propose. Maybe you'll be lucky enough to see it or your significant other will say yes!"
Another great beach in Busan,"The street along the beachfront is lined with tons of restaurants and cafes. At night, you can watch the light show on the bridge. People also come at night to light off fireworks."
Night View,We had dinner by the beach in the evening - bought kimbap and coffee on the way and ramyeon at the nearest convenient shop. Plenty of people enjoying the nice breeze and the night view.
Free and easy,Just like Haeundae Beach except that this has a smaller field of view. Within walking distance to the nearest subway station. The walk towards the beach is more interesting to me than the beach itself.
Best at night,"Lovely beach, not sure if its man made. Is best visited at night when the bridge is lit up. People also bring their own fireworks which adds to the atmosphere. There are many restaurants and bars with sea views."
plan your trip in time for the night light up! (with music!),"we walked there after dinner and at about 9pm we heard some music playing and there were dancing lights on the bridge. we prob missed part of the ""light up"" but were satisfied. can't take much pix at night though."
A smaller beach with nice view,There is less people than Haeudae but also with a beautiful view of the bridge. Many restaurants could be found nearby but relatively expensive if you compare with the downtown area. Loads of coffee shops could be found along the beach and some of them even have a balcony or so to let customer enjoy the nice view.
Food?,Enjoyed walking the beach but nowhere to get something cold to drink or snacks unless you go to a restaurant. 
Nothing much,"Went there to see the bridge lights show 'Wings'. The song was slow and boring, and after it ended there was nothing else to do there. "
Best beach option ,The nicer of the two beaches (not as crowded). Good mix of people. Some nice bars (HQ among others) great view of the Gwangalli bridge. One thing to look out for is the last subway as I think it only runs till 23.30
Beautiful view day and night,"Although people rave about Haeunde, Gwangalli is my favourite beach in Busan. It is not that crowded with tourists during the day, and during the night it is booming with nightlife. It's surrounded by cafes and restaurants, which are very international in style. Jetskies, boats and paddeling boards are available for rent. During the night the young crowds gather to party at the bars or have a drink with friends at the beach. Nice atmosphere, and the view of the brigde at night is fantastic."
Safe and clean,"GWANGALI BEACH is a beautiful and clean white sandy beach. It has even-spaced free umbrellas all along it. It attracts Koreans and foreigners alike.Apparently, this is the most sought after beach in South Korea. Unless you enjoy crowds, avoid coming here during public holidays.The local authorities organize lots of activities/festivals at specific times of the year. One can find the info on Internet. ~> From the beach, you can admire the GWANGALI BRIDGE which spans over the sea and is illuminated at night. ~> You can walk or bicycle along the sidewalk.~> You can hire bicycles and ride to HAEUNDAE beach, JANGSAN Mountain or IGIDAY Mountain. You can even walk to those places as they are at a reasonable distance from Gwangali Beach. I enjoy to walk to/fro on a regular basis.~> You can enjoy a drink or a meal at one of the many eateries and tearooms that cater to different palates. You will only have 2 problems : where to go to and what to choose from the menus.~> You can enjoy an overnight stay at one of the many hotels/motels.~> You can enjoy roaming and spending money at some of the boutiques.~> You can avail of the many items sold at the little grocery stores or at Mega Mart.If you have a few days, Gwangali Beach is not too far away from1.JAGALCHI Fish Market (the biggest fish  market in South Korea), 2. GUKJE Market, 3. BIFF, 4. UNDERGROUND Market (inside the  subway...it has +- 18 exits and is quite  long),5. PEOPLE's PARC. ~> All 5 sites are just one bus ride or subway ride away from Gwangali Beach. ~> All 5 are in the same neighbourhood and are interconnected. ~> All 5 can be enjoyed together within one or two days.Enjoy a sunny and sandy day at Gwangali Beach !"
Beautiful scenery ,"The beach is really amazing, the view of the bridge is stunning and there are so many shops in this area! I went there alone and biked towards the end part of the beach and I saw some people basking which is really wonderful I think :) "
Lively beach with view of Gwangandaegyo Bridge,We visited the beach during a lively traditional festival. It's a beautiful beach with a lovely view of Gwangandaegyo Bridge and an array of modern glass commercial buildings.
I love this beach,"Normally you will hear about Haeunda beach is famous in Busan, but in Summer it is really very very crowded , so if you are going to Busan in summer don't miss Gwangalli beach, of course it is full of cafe and restaurants along the beach"
great area but the traffic getting there is pretty bad..,A great setting overlooking the bridge . . packed full of restaurants and bars and people. . the traffic getting around Busan is quite frustrating tho . . stick to subway if you can. .
Beach in the middle of the city,Gwangalli beach is a small beach in the midst of Busan's urban landscape. You can see the Gwangandaegyo bridge from the beach and it offers quite a nice view at night when the bridge lights up. 
beautiful beach,"We walked from Gwangan station and unsure of the directions. A friendly local showed us the way. It was about 20min walk from the station. We went in the evening to see the lighted bridge. There were a lot of restaurants, bars and shops. Great to spend a few hours just to relax :)"
Gorgeous View,"Would recommend coming here at night. Possibly pair with dinner or drinks since there are several options around the area. View of the bridge is amazing. At every top of the hour, there is a small light show where you can get great pictures. "
Nice beach with a good view of the Gangan Bridge,"The beach is quite easy to go. One could take the metro to Geumnyeonsan (station #210) and take a 10 minutes walk towards the seaside. The beach and the bridge will be right in front of you. Further to the right (10 minutes walk) is the Samik Apartments well known for its cherry blossom lined roads during late March/ early April. The beach is long and open, ideal for a leisurely stroll especially towards the evening."
Beautiful view,Beautiful beach with awesome view of brdige.... Lovely place to sit and spend sometime in the evening.... Many bars and restaurants at the opposite side. Worth a visit.
Beautiful clean beach,"Beautiful clean, sandy beach with plenty of places to eat and drink. Views of the bridge especially at night when its all lit up are spectacular."
"THE SAFEST, CLEANEST AND MOST LUXURIOUS BEACH FOR FUN AND REST IN BUSAN.","Visited this beach while on conferencing expedition in Busan- South Korea. A rare beach that is very clean- no littering around, well lit, accessible, safe , welcoming and cool. Smart place to watch natures gift, breath the cool air, rest, honeymoon, bond with family and friends and also meditations. A must visit for adventure , great picnic and team building beach games for memorable moments in life!"
A beautiful night scene,"Please visit this at night. as a beach, there's nothing much to view it during the day, but at night, the lights from the buildings around it... by the bridge nearby..that is it's uniqueness compared to other beaches in busan."
Gorgeous ,"Beautiful beach, it was semi cold so I couldn't get into the water but was able to get great videos and shots of the area. A definite place to visit, specially in the summer. The restaurants around were a bit pricey but were good, if you drive or walk a ways you can find decent places to eat."
clean beach with view of the colorful bridge,"Clean beach with a view of the colourful bridge, where there are streets of shops and eateries around the area if you get hungry. There are seats by the entrance of the beach, where u can sit there and have takeaways and beer while enjoying the view. There are also shops selling firecrackers that can be put up at the beach."
A nice beach,Been to many other nicer beaches in Vietnam so this is just an average nice beach to me. The beach is actuallly very clean and well preserved.
Nice walk,"Nice to walk along the beach and see the city from a different spot. Durri g the liw season (when were there) we haven't seen any one swim, to cold, but from pictures and videos of how it is durring the summer, it's doubtful that you'll enjoy your swim because the place is over packed."
Night light show,"If you are planning to visit Gwangalli beach, better be at night since at it know for its Bridge light show."
Best place to injoy if you are nature Lovers...,"There's always second time next time...""Indescribable feelings"" Will be back @ Autom time also to witness beautiful views in Nami Island too.includes Busan Tower, Seoul Tower & many many more place to visit...15 days maybe enough to visit South korea best attraction... Love much"
The best place to enjoy the view of the beach and gwangandaegyo bridge.,We took videos and pics while we stayed here. We also witnessed fireworks display and a street performance. There are so many restaurants around the area. 
It just indescribable,"The beach was beauty, places around are all buidings, dint see anyone swimming there but got some family and couple picnic and drunks there."
The spacious and activities beach of Busan,"Gwangalli Beach is my choice for beaches in Busan. I rate it 4/5 in comparison to other Korean beaches, no way any beach in Korea would be 4/5 compared to Thailand or such. But for the area, it's great! Spacious, okay swimming, not as many restaurants as Haeundae to the east, but Gwangalli has water sports and if you like that sort of thing...a view of the Gwangahn Bridge. In the morning it makes for a nice walk along the shore, in the evening/night it's a nice view of the bridge. For beach activities June through September there are many fun things to do. Kayaking (just the small plastic ones, for fun), Windsurfing (though it's more sailboarding and often slow going in July and August), boating, tubing (pulled by a boat), jet skiing (mostly wave running as we call it, the sit down and enjoy the ride type), etc... It's not as popular as Haeundae and I don't understand why...if you're looking for a good/great beach experience it's a lot better than Haeundae. If you're people watching, Haeundae maybe the better place. Gwangalli is more of a family beach I'd say. But I used to ride my bike there 3-4 days a week from May to September (but again they may blow whistles at you if you're swimming in any but the ""life guarded"" months of July and August)."
Beautoful Night View ,"Gwangalli is very famous place in many Korean dramas.. And it reserves it. Evening walks around the beach and staring at the colorful bridge accompanied with music is really great and makes you feel relaxed. More over, of you are hungry , along the street there are many caf√©s, coffee shops and restaurants. Gwangalli is also a placed beloved by many Busan citizens. Just take your time and have a walk along the beach with a cup of cold americano :)"
The bridge made a great view,"I visited before sunset and stayed for dinner. There are many coffee joints, korean restaurants and western food along the main road by the beach. There is also Paris Baguette if you wish to get a snack and sit at the beach. The view was ok and we stayed on until at night for the bridge to be lit up. Nice view and the stroll was relaxing.After dinner, we strolled by the beach again. It was serene. The were public toilets by the beach with no charge."
Excellent view at sunset/ night,"I visited here around sunset / night. The view was excellent. Hard to find local food here, mainly pubs and cafes, but definitely worth visiting. Sunset with the Gwangandaegyo bridge at the back."
Good for chilling,Just perfect place for having a glass of beer at terrace bar.You can even just walk and rest at the beach.Cool place for every purpose of tourist.
Best beach in Busan,"Great beach. Might not be as wide as Haeundae but everything is RIGHT THERE at the beach (food, drink, washroom). Not having to walk great distances makes it super convenient. The prices in Haeundae are higher also. The bridge makes a nice background especially at night. Personally, I find Haeundae a little scary at night. All in all, this place is clean and has a great boardwalk. "
Good for walk,This is a walk-able beach. From side to another side is not really far. Surrounded by seafood restaurants and food stalls. The beach itself is very clean but the sand is quite harsh and brown. Very urban scenery!
gorgeous sunrise in winter,"Went to the beach at 7:30am in early January -- so no swimming as such. The sunrise view was gorgeous -- it is somewhat unique in that the entire beach is within sight of a giant suspension bridge, so the scene is a little unusual but pretty. (See pics.) Supporting facilities (e.g. toilets) are available across the main road. Sunrise took about 30 minutes (arrived a little before 7:30am; the sun fully up by about 8am; walk to the nearest subway station took another 15-20 minutes)."
Beach along the high rise buildings,The beach can be reached after around 10 to 15 minutes leisurely walk from the subway station. The place around teh beach is quite dirty because of tourists' litters.
Came here for the light show at night - disappointed,"It was quite a long walk from the nearest station, but I thought the light show would be worth it. But I was wrong, it was nothing impressive. Of course there was the lively vibe, with locals shooting their own fireworks. But it was not worth the far walk in the cold and wind."
Privacy beach,The view beach can look at Gwangali bridge.and fell like privacy beach and beautiful.Relax and enjoy this here
Diamond Bridge is Love,"I went here on a winter season so I didnt enjoy the beach that much but being the Diamond Bridge on the side as a view by night, definitely one of a kind. "
Best to visit at night,"By day Gwangalli is a clean beach but a little smaller than Haeundae. It's real selling point is the views of Gwangandaegyo Bridge by night. There are a few light sculptures to see as well and locals often fire a few fireworks. It is also surrounded by restaurants and bars, so is great for a pre or post dinner walk"
A beach trapped between a major road and a gigantic bridge,"The beach itself is OK. It is broad and clean and the surf looked tame (at least on the overcast day I was there). In good weather, it might be nice to sit and relax.But just behind the beach was a major road with ceaseless traffic noise. 600 - 700m out at sea is a gigantic suspension bridge which one might admire as a feat of engineering, However, to me at least, the view somehow doesn't quite fit the idea of a day of escape.There are a several cafes and restaurants along that major road, so you won't go hungry.The beach isn't difficult to reach by metro. It's a 400m walk east from Geumnyeonsan metro station to reach the southern half of the beach but the locality is rather dreary. The nicer shops are towards the northern end, but it is 1 km from Gwangan station from there."
Second beautiful beach in Busan.,"Visited same day as Haeundae beach via Buti bus (similar to hop-on hop-off bus)but run by City of Busan. The beach is very close to restaurants and shops too. Bridge across the water lights up at night. Visited in November, so too cool to go for a quick swim, but had an enjoyable time here."
A nice beach~,I don't think this beach is that over the top but it's nice and I can understand why people would come here for vacation. It's less busy than Haeundae. I would recommend getting an accommodation here and relax for a day. It's chilly and windy at the moment but it's worth the visit if you want to be near the water to relax and walk around.
"Haeundae Beach, Jr.","The beach is very similar to Haeundae Beach, albeit a smaller version of it. The beach seemed to be half (or smaller) the size of Haeundae Beach. It also has the Gwangalli Bridge blocking (or perhaps some may say enhancing) the views of the seas. Similar to Haeundae Beach, there aren't too many places to sit, no lounge chairs available (at least in the off-peak season). There were not many people when I visited in November, though I could imagine the beach is very crowded in the summer. There are plenty of restaurants and shops surrounding the beach - especially a few good places to get coffee/tea with a view of the sea.I don't believe it's really worth the visit in the off-season though."
Nice view at night,Great place to visit especially at night where you can see the bridge and unwind after a long day of sightseeing.
Nice beach,"Very nice beach for a stroll, both at night and during day time. Nice view over the Gwangali bridge with spectacular lightning through the night. Probably crowded during summer, but really beautiful in the off season as well."
"Fireworks at Gwangalli beach in Busan, South Korea","We came to this beach for the annual fireworks festival that attracts thousands of people. We got there early around 6:30pm even if the show started at 8pm, because we knew it would be crowded. There are several restaurants, shops and convenience stores between the metro station and the beach. There were many street vendors selling blankets and beach pads for a reasonable price. The beach itself seems more dirt than sand and has some small rocks, but the location and views are beautiful. For the festival there was a lot of police and everything seemed very organized with directions, toilets and fences. The festival was beautiful with fireworks and music synchronized and all the lights reflecting on the water. It is held once a year and in 2016 it was on October the 22nd, Four stars to the beach, five to the festival."
Nice view of the rainbow bridge,We came in the morning so we didn't see the rainbow bridge lit up but it's a nice small beach with the city and water skylines.There are plenty of restaurants around.
Nice night view!,Nice view during night time. Relax and chill. U Mau have a cup of hot coffee to chill at the beach. Or soju n makgeolli is a good choice too. 
nice beach!,"Ï¢ãÏùÄ Î∞îÎã§, it's so clean and warm beach in the winter,but compare than haeundae beach i love haeundae beach more ^^"
Happenings,"Gwangalli Beach is where most the happenings during the night. There are plenty of western food to choose. Bars, ice cream parlour, coffee cafes are sprouting all along the beach area. You can also find Japanese or Korean food here but it's pricey. Taxi fare from where I stay, Comma Hotel costs me Won8600. There's a dessert cafe 'Discovery Taste' which has one of the best cheese cake called 'Double Cheese', it's soft, fluffy n not too sweet, a Must Try! "
"Love here! (For me, better than Haeundae!)","Gwangan beach is smaller than Haeundae beach, more peaceful and less foreigners here.And there is walking road through the beach, you can enjoy taking a walk too.Gwangan beach makes this beach more comfortable(I don't know why, haha) and it will make memorable experience.Especially I love to go Cafe near this beach not only in day times but also in the night."
"A good place to relax, eat and people watching.","The beach is beautifuuly lit when dark. So it is good to go in the evening around 5pm and stay till late night to see the bright side and the dark side of the bridge. With day light of course you can see the beautiful sandy beach. ( but I have not seen people swimming ). Then after dark the bridge will be transformed into a LED giant. Very magnificient and stunning bridge. Lots of activities especially at night with mini concerts and street musicians performing music, singing and even break dance. Lots of restaurants on the seafront selling seafood, Korean and western food. Plenty of hotels too in the area. Both budget and 5 stars.A good place to go when in Busan."
"Not Crowded, Relaxing",It is a relaxing beach and it is not over crowded. There are umbrellas along the beach but there is no chairs or benches. So it would be advisable to bring your own beach map and we did. It is good place to watch the famous Gwangalli bridge. We spent the whole evening there. There are also a lot of restaurants near the beach. It also seems to be a popular picnic spot for young local couples.
Pretty and relaxing,I didn't see people swim so I don't know if that is a thing to do in October. But if you want to grab coffee and relax then this is a pretty nice place to be.
Night beach view,"Came here at night, where there's a lot of seafood restaurant along its beach front. Also the Gwangandaegyo Bridge is just opposite it, lighted brightly with a mini light show. Nice place to relax after a long day touring around Busan"
Gwangalli,Beautiful beach. I prefer this one than Haeundae beach. More things to do at night. You can see the bridge too
Relaxed beach,Another great beach of Busan; if you want to avoid the crowds then come here. Its getting better with more bars and cafes along the strip. 
Beautiful Beach,"The beach is clean and the view with the long bridge is awesome. There are many food places, bars and cafe."
Popular & fashionable area!,"We only visited the beach at night so there wasn't much beach activities going on besides crowds gathering around with music plays and street entertainment, which was enjoyable! The beach is line with streets of streets of cafes, bars, restaurants etc etc, all lighted up beautifully. Also a magnificent view of the famous diamond bridge. I have always love Korea this way! "
Day trip to Busan great spot for refreshments,Stopped off at beach for a browse. It's the beginning of Autumn (fall). Water nice and flat and lots of restaurants western and Korean with beautiful beach views. 
Da beach,"Really good nightlife/bar scene. You can either chat up the girls in a packed bar or you can find a dive bar and chill with your buddies. All right on the water, enjoy."
to visit during summer,went in weekend during summer.. activities including hosting singing bands was held..many food resturants and cafes opossite Street..enjoyed walking along this well maintained beach .. in the night a street dancing also was held 
By night and day,You should experience this beach at day and at night. In the nighttime the surrounding buildings as well as the bridge is covered in lightformations
"Great view, good eats and dirty water!",This is our favorite place in Busan. Much quieter than Haeundae Beach. With many restaurants and bars right across the street from the beach.
Fun beach with many Restaurants near by.,Busan has two main beaches in downtown. The Gwangalli is great to visit to enjoy some drinks or food with a beach view.
Beautiful stretch of clean beach.,Beautiful clean beach with enough bars and restaurants on beach road. Too much Traffic on beachroad. Best time to visit is evening as then you see the beautifully lit Gwangandaegyo bridge. The best I saw was delivery scooter delivering food on the beach. Photos to show it. When he stops he phones to find out where on the beach people are. #Fascinating
Lovely at night,I would recommend going here at night. There are loads of bars and restaurants dotting the shoreline so you won't go hungry! And the beach is nice too which a lovely view of the bridge.
Nice night view ,"Coming from Australia we're not easily impressed by beaches. We opted to visit gwangali at night to see the famous bridge that lights up at night. It was quite pretty and occasionally the lights coming up in interesting and exciting patterns. The street in front of the beach in lined with coffee shops and restaurants. If you walk with the beach on your right to the end, you will come across Millak fish Market which has 10 stories if restaurants on top of it. Some of the restaurants have a nice view of the beach. "
Excellent view on this bridge,"Afternoon, evening is the best period, because of the light show on the bridge in the evening. What a great bridge to see. The restaurants at the beach side are somehow more expensive, but that counts for every beach.Enjoy the scene !"
Great Night time location,"Unfortunately I was only there at night, but the beach itself did look nice and clean with ample facilities. Around the beach lots of eatery's and bars that cater both for locals and westerners. I have been to Haeundae beach which is just crazy during summer so I think Gwangalli would be a far better option away from the crowds. If you take the subway you are still up for about a 650m walk."
Lots happening here,Come to this beach about 7pm. Can view gwananlli bridge from here. Lots happening. Youths gather here for singing etc. 
Beautiful beach,Very nice beach clean and well maintained with life savers shops etc. Water clean also give haeundae beach a visit next to one another
Great place to view the Gwangandaegyo Bridge in Busan.,"Came here for the bridge view and also enjoyed the leisurely walk, watching locals and their dogs walking about. Not crowded. Waited till sundown to see how the view of the bridge changes from day to night. Many beach side cafes, but quite far from the metro station. A nice stretch of beach, but not really for swimming. "
Beautiful and Happening at Night,"My friend and I came to the beach at night to see the famous Gwangan Bridge. The light up is indeed very beautiful and the bridge looks magnificent. The beach itself has countless restaurants and cafes along the coast, it's a very happening place. Lots of tourist and locals gather here, it's a good place to drop by if you are in Busan."
Happening!,"A busy and happening beach area comparing to Haeundae beach. Lots of restaurants, bars, cafes along the beach. Good place to hangout at night."
Good Indian food restaurant ,Chicken Tika masla is very good with garlic nan TN dori chicken is so delicious Lasi is indain traditional drinks is so good 
Very relaxing beach,"Gwangalli is just a couple of miles away from Haeundae. The beach itself is similar in quality and size, but Gwangalli feels much quieter and calmer. Not so many restaurants, foreign tourists or tall buildings. I think it all comes down to a matter of personal taste. I happen to like Haeundae better, but I guess some people would find Gwangalli more authentic. No matter what, very enjoyable, and a great iew of the sea and the city."
disappointing.,"Busy road next to Boulevard, unlike Haeundae beach where you can stroll and don't get annoyed by traffic. Would skip the visit and go to Haeundae or Songdo beach."
Night strolling,I came here at night and I'm glad I did because I got to see great view of Gwangandaegyo Bridge. I prefer this beach than Haeundae because it less crowded.
A great hangout beach,This beach is alive and vibrant in the morning and afternoon and then fun and partying at night.Although it is a more local beach there are still many great international eating places right in front of the beach to just sit and hang out. Pick any good looking food place you want and just enjoy the people watching and good food. There is also a small carnival and market towards the left side of the beach
Nice Beach,This beach provides an excellent view of Gwangan Bridge. This view is especially good at night as the bridge lights up. Gwangan Stn (Exit 5) is nearby and there are many restaurants near the beach.
Nice Beachfront,"Good restaurants along the beach front. Nice variety and reasonably priced. Great view at night of the bridge. A nice way to spend an afternoon and evening. Very cool area. Would come back any time during nice weather. Not as crowded as Haeundae, less luxury hotels, but the restaurants are still very enjoyable."
Local Beach,This is not a tourist oriented beach. More for the locals but if you wonder here you will be pleased with what it has to offer. Nice sand and friendly people. 
Nice walk in the evening,"Had a nice walk here in the evening. Artificial beach, but actually quite nice. Would go here again."
Good night view,"We had chimaek (chicken+ beer) by the beach at night and enjoyed the view of the lit Gwangan Bridge. As it was dark, it's difficult to tell if the beach is clean. There were also quite a number of street performers showing off their skills. Good place to relax."
The bridge at night is pretty,"Quieter and less known than Haeundae Beach, Gwangalli is a nice option. The restaurants and shops are not as high- brow, (or high-priced,) and even on a holiday weekend it wasn't overly busy here. It seems to be a favourite of the local ex-pat crowd."
Beautiful beach with nice firework,"We came during the International Firework Festival in October 2015. It's a wonderful firework with amazing scene. We started to come here at around 6pm. Eventhough there were a hugh crowd, we manage to catch the subway and reached here peacefully. Thanks to the policeman and the soldiers working at the subway station. We disembark on a station earlier than Gwangalli Station to avoid the crowd. The beach is already occupied by people, with picnic barket and own entertainment. We were very lucky, manage to get a seat in a cafe facing the bridge. The show started at 8pm and lasted till 9pm. The firework was fantastic. There were theme, music and laser show to accompany the firework. The bridge was so colorful, no wonder it's so famous. At the end of the show, we stayed back to enjoy our dinner at one of the restaurant. There were so many people but the beach is still clean after the firework and that's to me an amazing thing. Will definitely visit this place again. Not only for the view but for the nice food and ambience here."
The view,Enjoy the view of gwangalli bridge either at day or night. Recommend to go the in the summer or spring. You want to enjoy more about busan? Try to take the Busan tour bus from busan station. Its cost you USD$10 to get arpund busan the cheap way
Sunbathing/view beach,"How much you will like Gwangalli depends on what you want in a beach. If you want to see coral, fish, and ocean wildlife, you won't like it. If you want a summer sunbathing spot, you'll probably enjoy it a lot. At night the beach presents a great view of the lit-up bridge which basically has light shows going off it, so that's a cool perk. And the beach itself is lined with hundreds of coffee shops, restaurants and hotels. Convenient. "
Loved to live here!,"The night life of Gwangalli is quite amazing, nice place to drink and meet people from all around the world. Located next to one of the most famous beaches of Korea (Heundae) locals are also very friendly and helpful. I used to live for around 1 year in this city and i definitely will come back again,"
Prefered 4 me,"Good place . Beach is as good as its neighbour. Importantly, there is are a good mix of food around and less crowded then its neighbour, nth much to highlight except, enjoy the full view of the bridge, it is the best place to see the bridge. Have a coffee or a beer. Check out if there are any events on busan tourism website. They do host alot of events"
Very hip place to be!,Lovely views of the beach and the bridge and plenty of nice cafes to enjoy the view. Take a walk to enjoy the cool breeze.
Relax in the city,"Was here in May, it's a great spot to hang out and relax while remaining in the city. The water was quite chilly when I went and did not have a lot of swimmers, but the sand was busy (though not overcrowded, as the beach stretches out quite far) and full of locals taking pictures... with Selfie sticks :)"
Great Beach day!,"Visited Gwanganli beach for the first time with friends yesterday. Song was our host/bartender. He was down to earth, helpful, and very friendly. The drinks and food was on point. I will definitely go again when I'm in Busan! "
Exciting night life,This is a great place for older adults to enjoy a alcoholic beverage and relax with out trying to keep up with the younger adults. 
"small, quaint with great views",Much smaller than its sister across the bay in Haeundae but arguably better. Cheaper sashimi restaurants and a better view of Gwangan bridge. A nice place to spend a sunny day relaxing in Busan. Gets crazy busy during fireworks festival time though. That goes for most places in Haeundae and Suyoung-gus.
Small beach with excellent view!,Great beach to relax and enjoy the view of the diamond bridge. Located near several bars and restaurants so a great place to hang out day or night. During the Busan fireworks festival this is the popular viewing spot!
Nice Beach With Lots of Surrounding Restaurants,"I grew up going to this beach when I was young and it sure has changed a lot over the years. Even with all the surrounding buildings, the beach was still nice and clean. It wasn't busy when I visited in the Spring."
Good local beach ,I used to go to gwangali beach pretty often. Nice area and view. Good eats all around. Extremely crowded during firework festival. It's nice when it lights up at night.
Plenty of Fish in the Sea,"Gwangalli beach is beautiful and quaint. Apparently it is extremely busy in the summer time but other than that, it is a relaxed beach town with plenty to offer. Coffee shops and brunch by day, to cocktails and lounges by night. It has a great view of the ocean and you can also rent a boat and take it out. I recommend just walking until you find something that catches your eye. If not the sights, then the seafood restaurants and other food attractions will."
Nice sunrise view from beach.,I had been there for view sunrise at the morning during my stay at here. It's awesome. Got chance to see bird along the beach.
Nice strip of beach filled out with foreigner-friendly restaurants,"Nice photo opportunity, and interesting view. The restaurants surrounding the place, though, are the real winners. At Sharky's, you can find a nice, juicy, actual American-tasting burger, and at Brunsweek, you can find great American breakfast food like French toast and pancakes. This is the real reason I'd recommend Gwangalli Beach, along with its convenient location next to a bunch of other attractions in Busan. :)"
"WONDERFUL BEACH.,","Here is very long, beautiful beach.Around here well developed merchandise are add a convinience."
The Place For Foreigners,"Gwangalli Beach is the place for foreigners and locals alike. The strip is filled with foreigner bars and restaurants. The beach itself is small, but it offers a great view of the bridge, which is lit every night. During my stay, I often went out there with friends to hangout or walk on the beach. "
Just had a walk there for funny,This beach is just next to our first apartment in Samich beach where my kids went swimming after school time even it's not the best beach in Busan 
nice beach with Gwangalli Bridge across the horizon,"need to take a short walk from Gwangalli station, but is an easy walk.it was raining when I was there, but the view is definitely not disappointing. with Gwangalli bridge across the horizon, it's splendid. the night view will be even better.plenty of eateries and water holes near the beach."
Beautiful,"Go at night for the diamond bridge light show. Grab a box of chicken, a blanket and some bottles of soju. Buy some fireworks. Sit back and enjoy. Wonderful."
Familiar beach ,"This beach is the best option for a weekend in family. A lot of sports activities, including water sports, the highlight is for the bike track along the beach. Worth the visit."
Quiet stroll,Looked for somewhere quieter and decided to head down to this beach instead of Haeundae. A stretch (not too long) that is suitable for an evening stroll with lots of restaurants and cafes to chill. 
Great View and Dining,"Gwangalli Beach is less popular than Haeundae Beach among visitors, though it is not a lesser location. It is far quieter, has a great view of the Gwangan Bridge, and has restaurants and bars practically on the beach."
Fireworks!,I think this beach is better than Haeundae if you're not looking to go into the water. Buy some fireworks from the vendors and have your own pyrotechnic fest! It was a romantic place to be and you could feel as though Busan was the most magical place in the world. Don't go for the loud noisy places if you're looking for food. Try the mom and pap stores with good home cooking. Cheaper but tastier. We had a really good bulgogi there with a really nice immu (aunt). 
There were fireworks festival,"I could not enjoy the beach since that day coincided with the fireworks festival which was held there. there were so many people, even the street was closed and security everywhere. Too bad we didn't know about the festival, if we knew it we wouldn't bother to come."
Nice beach,"Nice beach for afternoon walks, relatively quiet (but maybe because I came during autumn) and also has a lovely view at night. The restaurant around it is also quite nice"
Great night view!,"Less crowded than Haeundae, great for sunrise/sunset or chilling with friends or a book at any point of the day."
Nice Beach,One of the iconic beaches of Busan. It has a view of the twin diamond bridge. Good for a stroll with your loved ones.It‚Äôs walkable from Gwangan metro station too.
Beautiful beach with an awesome view of the Gwangan Bridge,Beautiful beach with an awesome view of the Gwangan Bridge especially during the night. There are a lot of seafood restaurant located along the bridge. 
Busan public beach,"The second best beach of busan west of haeundae and starting from the gwangalli bridge. It is like a half moon with a length of 1.5 km and clean sand.the alley has shops,night clubs, food courts and hotels all around. Good place for sun bathe and spending few hours at the beach"
Fun especially at night,This is a beautiful beach in the day and a romantic one at night. It is so clean and not so crowded as in the other beaches in other countries. There's lots of eating places around and one must go walk around the many side streets that are around the beach to get a feel of the night life. Most of all the view of the lighted Gwangalli bridge at night as seen from the beach is really so beautiful. You can spend hours just sitting on the beach and enjoying the sights. A lot of times there will be fireworks displays and people lighting lighted wish balloons that add to the glorious night view.
Lovely place,"Came on a rainy day though... do enjoy my food time here with greats coffee and dessert. It's not too hard to find, just get to Gwangan station #209, exit 3 or 5 and just walk straight for about 650m, you will reach the beach with amazing night view, just like rainbow bridge in Japan."
Lovely beach in Busan,Pleasant to stroll during day time; I'm sure it's more charming in the evening. Many cafes overlooking the beach; pick one and chill out
Very alive at night! Don't miss it!,"I visit this beach to see the beauty of Gwangan Bridge at night.Be aware of quite long walking to the beach from Gwangan Station. The area near station is quite dark but once you come near the beach, it's really alive!There was a performance of group who cycling follow the rythme of music. The crowds was quite crazy around them, cheer them up. But I don't really know them. :pSo in my conclusion, like the other beaches, there will be a street performance at night.You can chill and spend your time here while enjoy the view of Gwangan Bridge. Don't miss this place when you visiting Busan!"
Really nice!!,"We visited the beach by night and we felt so good there that we decided to spend the major part of the night on the beach, looking at all the people playing fireworks, and the show on the Gwangan Bridge. Nice atmosphere, I felt really good there. I highly recommend it!!"
Beautiful night view,"Night view is beautiful, cafes and eateries are nearby. Nice place to chill. A bit far from Gwangalli subway station, about 15 mins walk."
Great nightlife atmosphere,"My wife and I came here on a Saturday night. There are a ton of restaurants and bars in the area, along with many people enjoying beverages and blowing off fireworks on the beach. With the Gwangan Bridge in the background of the lit up city, it is an excellent view and fun atmosphere. Would definitely recommend coming here for the nightlife."
Best in Busan. ,Full of fun nightlife and chill day spots. I've camped on the beach before and prefer this beach to the others. The strip along the beach is so fun but don't forget to check out the back streets too! 
One of the cleanest beach in Asia,"I visited this place both in the morning, afternoon and the evening (in different days). I think it is best to go in the morning. For some reason I didn't see much people swimming in the area - it was more like a park for them. If you are planning to see the bridge lights, well its not really worth the wait. The lights doesn't really synchronize with the music and it has limited effects. There are also several places around the beach for photo ups which are really cute."
Awesome Busan,"There's more to Busan than Haeundae Beach. I loved my time staying at the Gwangalli Beach area which is less crowded.The Gwanganli marine bridge spans the bay and is lit up in the night - changing pretty colours. Following the Korean calendar, some time in October there are fireworks over an hour right over the bridge creating a wondrous sight. There are many restaurants and various types of pubs and music bars to enjoy the view in and chat the night away. We chanced upon a carnival arcade in a side street and had a whale of a time. If your stomach can take it there's a ride that flips you 360¬∞ five times a few times - awesome. Just like you'll find in Gold Coast, 6 flags magic mountain, Sentosa etc.Go up to grumryonsan to view the sunset over the coast then see the night lights come on. The scenes are beautiful and magical. Best place with a loved one in your arms. "
A hidden gem ,"This beach is only the second most popular in Busan, mostly being visited by local Koreans. However, this means that it is a lot quieter than Haeundae but it still has all of the amenities. There are plenty of restaurants and shops along the length of the beach, although they are more expensive than is normal in this city. Gwangalli really comes in to its own at night. The light show on the bridge in the bay is magnificent and is worth a trip all by itself. The whole beach lights up and is a great place to relax. At certain times of the year they shut down the roads and have a street party which is well worth a look. If you go to busan, choose this beach."
Beautiful night scenery,"Feel the breeze on the beach and have some photos with the beautiful night scenery, very relaxing and enjoying."
Smart beach?,"nice beach, but nothing spectacular, have been to many nicer beaches. Nice to be able to sit on the beach then take a short walk and have many restaurants and bars to stop at .it is billed as a smoart beach, you can use you smart phoine to pay for all sort of rentals, umbrellas, tubes etc."
Better than Haeundae!,"This beach is SO MUCH BETTER than Haeundae. I don't know why anyone prefers Haeundae over Gwangalli. It's much less populated and has a gorgeous view of the bridge, during the day and at night. Lots of fun water activities to do in the summer, too. I'd say it's safer for children as there are less people."
"A nice place for drinks, walks and food. But not a great place for a beach day","Gwangalli is a good place to go to walk, see the night view, eat and get some drinks. I wouldn't reccomend it for swimming. It in a bay and the water isn't as clean as other beaches. Another thing is the Sea Doo's and boats in the area are driven by complete morons trying to show off. They come very close to the beach and drive as if it is their first time behind the wheel. "
Great Beach town,Went with couple friends. The place was clean and reasonable to stay. Had a great time and the food was also reasonable. Many places to eat along the beach. 
Should visit the beach at night.,"Should visit the beach at night. Lots of restaurants surround the beach. Really good to pick one for dinner. After dinner, enjoy the night view of Gwangan bridge when the lights were up."
Decent Beach,"The beach is quite busy but it is also not the cleanest beach you could go to. It does have a lot of bars, restaurants and other attractions nearby. At night the bridge in front of it lights up as amazing to see and there is a decent nightlife there in front of the beach too."
Beautiful at night,"The main attraction of the beach according to me is the illuminated Gwangalli Bridge at night. So to the enjoy that view, stroll on the beach after sunset and enjoy the sparkling view of the bridge and the sea waves."
Hilarious Bridge Lights,"Known for its fine sand, Gwangalli Beach is a refreshing few hours by the hour. It's considerably less crowded than Haeundae and has a great view of a lit up Busan at night. The bridge lights up and these hilarious images are displayed on the bridge. The highlight of my night was when this giant face showed up on the bridge. I was in stitches in the sand. Beware of the restaurants by the beach. They're generally fairly overpriced. Like actually they're ridiculously overpriced. But the Cold Stone there is killer. "
I like long walks on Gwangalli Beach,"Clean beach for all walks of life! Close range to a large number of restaurants and bars. Beautiful in the day time, but especially at night when the bridge lights up in the background of you soaking up the nightlife and the street performances are always memorable."
One of the highlights of Busan!,"I visited here with my family at night, and I loved the atmosphere and the veiw!! I would say that this place was more for youngsters than children/old people, especially at night, but still, I did see quite some families with children. There are lots of restaurants/cafes to choose from, so you will hardly starve here. After having a meal at one of the awesome restaurants, you can take a walk along the seashore, or watch people busking around.I would definitely comeback here if I were to visit Busan again in the future."
"A Place to Chill, but nothing much to see","Gwangalli Beach is known for people coming to see the nice lighting for the bridge and the nearby buildings. It tends to be quite crowded at night, but it is the time where you would see the beach come alive with the sparklers and fireworks that people are playing with."
Perfect for watching the light show!,"Smaller and quieter than Haeundae, come to this beach if you want to escape the crowds. Make sure to visit at night in order to enjoy the light show on Gwangan bridge, as well as the many bars and restaurants that line the adjacent street. Haeundae may have softer sand, but this beach has the best views in Busan."
"Beautiful at Night, A Great Spot for Dinner and a Stroll","This beach is best visited at night, when the lights of all the surrounding buildings and the bridge turn on, creating a colorful reflection in the water and making this a beautiful location to end your day. There are many restaurants along the beach offering up fresh seafood, but also many other global cuisines as well, you are sure to find something to your liking. Enjoy a great dinner with a view of the beach and bridge, then take a leisurely stroll along the waterfront and enjoy the ‚Äúlaid back‚Äù vibe of the area before popping in to one of the cafes for some dessert and coffee. A great way to spend a relaxing evening in Busan."
Go Surfing,Excellent place for surfing.. surfing paradise.. take a lesson from one of the best surfing schools of South Korea here.. and Enjoy
Gorgeous night view with many dining options,"Been to Gwangalli beach both in the day and night. Nothing much to see in the day and also, most restaurants have split shifts thus the time we were there (about 3pm), most were closed except for a handful. To go to in the night where the Gwangalli bridge is lit up and people lighting up fireworks and sparklers at the beach. The fireworks and sparklers can be bought from street vendors at the beach or at convenient stores located near the beach."
Very pretty,"I've been to this beach twice. It is very nice and clean. It is best to go at night because the bridge gets lit of very pretty. the streets also get a little busy with people and performers. There were also women walking around selling fire cracker type things, so that was nice"
Lots going on,"Good place to stay for a few days in Busan. Nightlife is buzzing, good selection of bars and restaurants for all tastes. Streest music and entertainers. Nice clean beach with golden sand, watersports available. Dont stay here if you want a quiet time."
Magical Gwangalli Beach,"A beautiful beach with easy access to Western restaurants. Buy some candy floss from a street vendor, walk along the beach and watch the bridge light up! Such a magical experience! "
"Great spot for food, drinks, relaxing, and amazing views","Gwangalli is one of my favorite areas of Busan. The beach is beautiful and the bridge light show at night is very nice. There are plenty of places to eat and drink along the beach, plenty to do for every one.On the metro green line (line 2), go to either the Gwangan stop or the Geumnyeonsan stop, they will bring you to one end of the beach or the other and you can walk along the whole stretch."
Way better than Haeundae,"Yeah. I mean, maybe a tiny bit smaller, not that size matters in any way with the beaches, there's plenty of room in both. But this one has the BRIDGE, which is amazingly beautiful at night. It's also closer to the centre of Busan, closer to busan station and the transfers, albeit by just a few stops.It's quieter, the buildings are more beautiful and the lights are more shiny. Overall an excellent beach."
Just a normal beach,"If you are looking for beach such as in Thailand with a lot of water sports, you would certainly be disappointed.Howe ever I wouldn't rate it lower because , it is quite clean beach with good sea view . Grab a cup of coffee and have a night / evening walk with your partner. If you are love aquariums, there is one next to beach. Shopping centers, fish market, roadside seafood shops and cafes are also next to beach."
Buddhas birthday,"Beach was magical that night. Fireworks, food, and the lights are shining everywhere. We had a blast lighting off sparklers and romans candles. We drank tall cans and chatted with other groups all along the beach."
Dont miss the fireworks during the autumn season !,"The fireworks at Gwangalli is just so beautiful. The firework festival happens during the autumn season in Busan. It happens usually around the second week of October. But mind it, if you don't get there by early evenings then you will be squashed among the thousands of people who come to get at least a glimpse of the fireworks. There is also an option to get on a boat that's cruising right below the Gwangalli bridge. Other than the fireworks I don't think the beach on a normal day is really great compared to the other beaches in Busan. "
Nice evening walk along this beach,"It was nice to walk along the beach around evening time. Gwangalli beach is surrounded by many pubs, caf√© & restaurants. When the light on diamond bridge, the view is awesome. The convenient shop even provide sitting place for customer, we had ramen and drinks while enjoying ours night at Gwangalli beach."
An amazing beach easily accessible from the road and with an incredible panoramic view of the bridge,The view from this very clean beach took our breath away! We were only there for a couple of hours but we had time to walk along the edge of the water which was lovely! I think it is accessible by wheelchair because it is very close to the road and it has lots of eateries fronting on to it. Would have loved to have had a longer visit!
Beautiful beach with the diamond bridge,There are restaurants and pubs along the beach (easy to get food). The view at night is spectacular. Less crowded compared to Haeundae beach. 
Talking an evening walk by the beach,"To get there use metro line 2, stop at Gwangan, exit 5 and follow the sign board to the beach. The best time to be there is at 7pm, when it is not too hot, and you get to witness the start of the night , when the surrounding buildings and Gwangan bridge starts to light up. We took a walk along the beach, admiring the changing skies and the illuminated bridge. After we had enough of the place, we crossed the road to have our dinner. There are many dining options available. Just before leaving, we were attracted to a group of girls singing and dancing away at the talents corner. Not too bad a performace from these aspiring K-pop starlets."
"My favourite beach in Busan, stunning at night",Visited as part of tour bus day and night. Beach was full of local school kids doing morning activities during the day and as a tourist this was nice to see. Lovely views the bridge which is particularly stunning at night. Beautiful.
Awesome night views,"Came with local friends, our motel is just is nearby the sea. Awesome night views out there with some dynamic laser performance. Highly recommend the motels surrounded the sea."
Nothing special,I have visited this beach after i have been to the Haeundae Beach. And in comparison the Gwangalli beach is smaller and a lot more dirty. Plastic bags and cigarette boxes don't belong onto the beach. I didn't like it so much and would rather prefer the much nicer Haeundae Beach. 
Nice view of Gwangan Bridge at night,"We visited Gwangalli Beach on Sunday night and we got off at Gwangan metro station. The directions to the beach were not very clear so we had to use our good senses and followed the crowd. We reached the beach after about 15 minutes walk.Gwangan bridge was brightly lighted and was right in front of us. The place was not too crowded and there were many couples on the beach. I would recommend this place for dinner as there are many restaurants here, or have a drink in one of the shops located opposite the beach."
Night view was awesome!,"I am not sure about the beach, but the view from the main road, and bustling eateries was awesome. The night lit bridge looked quiet majestic. You sure should pass by here at night, even if you dont spend time at the beach."
"Nice beach, great views of Busan beach area, many places to eat out","We did a hop-on hop-off bus tour around Busan, and Gwangalli Beach was one of our stops. Impressive views on all the new buildings around the beach area, great bridges, and very nice to just walk around and find the right spot for a quick snack. Plenty of choices are available... I found one serving Hoegaarden beer from Belgium."
"Nice beach, plenty of places to get food/drinks and have fun",At night the beach active with many couples walking down the beach enjoying the night views of the bridge and the lights from the hotels. It is nice. All along the beach you can stop into restaurants/shops/cafes and get what you want. It is easy to get to by the metro with about a 5 min walk.
Great for evening stroll and dinner,"For some reason, the signs/directions to the beach from the Gwangan station was not very clear. Ask a local if in doubt. If I remember correctly, you have to turn left somewhere after coming out from exit 5. The walk to the beach is about 10 mins. We reached Gwangalli beach in the evening and missed the sunset. The beach was not too crowded when we visited. There are mostly young Korean students playing with sparklers. There are many restaurants along the beach. It is a nice place to stroll and have dinner in a cool evening. If you have a evening to spare in Busan, you can visit this beach."
Better than Haeundae,"This beach is by far better- if you like more beach area for tossing a ball or disc, beach volleyball (there are nets), a more relaxed vibe and less scenesters. There is a cool feeling to the surround ""boardwalk"", with live music sometimes and local artisans. As well, across the street there is a great independent cafe name ""tokkie wahh"", it is all white, with great views of the bridge, beach and skyline."
great ambience,"Overlooking the Gwangan Bridge (also called Diamond Bridge), this is a beach less crowded though many people are walking around to take photos. I was there at night, and there was a group of singers right in front of the beach. Great voice they have, and with the view of the lit-up bridge, it was very relaxing."
I prefer this beach over Haeundae,"Loved the variety of bars and restaurants. It's cleaner and less crowded. I have been to Busan on two major occasions; the first was Chuseok (Korean Thanksgiving), and New Years 2015. Both times, I found this beach to be the better spot to hang out. The downside: the water is less clear than at Haeundae."
Underrated Beach,"Out of the famous beaches in Busan, Gwangalli is definitely a treasure in the hustle and bustle of summer. I would highly recommend spending a few hours here, maybe on the beach or in one of their many food joints. Gwangalli Beach has a very chill and local feel to it."
Best beach in Busan,"This beach is nice and much quieter than Haeundae beach. There are many good food places to choose from, and a craft beer brewery within walking distance. A great place during the day, but also a nice spot to sit at night and enjoy the bridge."
Gorgeous view of the bridge,"I think this is the most impressive beach in Busan. Many of the other beaches are much to crowded. You certainly couldn't camp on this beach, but the swimming is great for young kids because it is so shallow and so clean.There is an amazing seafood place just to the left of the beach, before the carnival area. The view at night cannot be beat. "
Nice beach. Had water.,"I went at night because I wanted to see the view. The lights were nice, the bridge was nicer, and the overall atmosphere was good (especially with live music on the promenade). Going at night, though, means you have to dodge the hundreds of other people who want to take pictures, so it's a bit crowded and odd. Still, it was nice enough, even if it wasn't anything terribly spectacular."
Best place to be in Busan,"Perhaps the best place to be in Busan. I came deep into winter, so there were not many people here. The scenery is amazing, especially at sunset. I advice chilling at one of the cafes overlooking the beach."
 Nice view in the night,We went to the beach because of the Diamond Bridge. In the night you can really see much but the view is nice and was very windy. Along through beach there are cafe where you can just go in to get a cup of hot coffee or you may chose to sit outside the cafe to enjoy your drink.Over all was a nice walk along the beach.
Good for an afternoon coffee time.,"I wouldnt rate it as a must-go place to visit for a trip in Busan, the reason to swing by is to either spend a tea time with friends and family as there are many cafes opposite the beach, or if you are a people watching person here would also be a good place to sit back and relax. Note: looking foward to sipping coffee with a view (the Gwangan bridge), sitting at the 2nd floor would be a good option to you."
Fantastic place,"Go up the side streets and you find neat little shops, great boutiques, restaurants, off the main drag the place is alive with local activity and such a safe and friendly place well worth a visit"
Nice beach ,"It was December, but the walk across this beach especially at dusk and in the evening was very beautiful. Would like to visit in the summer. "
Excellent at night,"Although it's not a huge beach and it's not completely amazing during the day, I found it to be very calm and quiet. It was nice just to sit at a cafe across from the beach and just look at the ocean. It is especially nice at night because you can see Gwangali Bridge light up at night. It's very good for taking pictures. Just beware that you might be walking with a lot of couples around you. I made the mistake of escaping from Seoul to Busan alone and felt a bit lonely. Bring some friends! haha"
Come here for Gwangan bridge night shot,This is not really one of the more picturesque beaches one would possibly visit. The sunset is hidden behind some skyscrapers. Only reason to come here would be to be photographed with the lit-up Gwangan bridge in the background. It'll be a good idea to arrive here in the evening. There are many coffee houses opposite the beach if you are interested in satisfying your thirst/hunger.
One of the best places to visit in Busan at night.,"I'd lived in Busan for three years and I'd definately recommend Gwangalli beach as one of the best places to go in Busan. In the day its nice for chilling out on one of the nice coffee shop patios and people watch. The beach itself is pretty small and not exactly rich in eye candy. If that is what you're looking for, Haeundae beach is by far the best for that.Where Gwangalli shines is its appeal at night. There are quite a few good restaurants and cafes located across from the beach with a clear line of site to Gwangan bridge. This is the main attraction of the area, as it lights up at night and its quite romantic. Great spot to take a date. There are also a few good sushi/sashimi restaurants (sashimi is what Busan is known for) by the beach."
Lovely,"I only visited in the evening (and in November at that) but really liked it.Very relaxing walk from either Gwangan Station (209 on the green line, exit 5) or Geumyeonsan station (210, exit 1 or 3), nice to wander along the boardwalk or beach, and spectacular views of the Gwangan Bridge at night (there's a light show on the hour, e.g. 8pm, 9pm, etc.).There's a vast array of bars and restaurants to choose from... and a Cold Stone Creamery (ice cream as performance art!) at the south end of the beach. The Tap & Tapas bar does a good selection of quality beers too."
Nice beach to hangout with your love one!,10-15 mins walk from Gwangan Subway Station. A happening beach with lots of pubs and restaurants. There were a group of Uni students having live band performance during my visit. Enjoyed the sea breeze and the awesome night view with the companion of my favourite Korean Fried Chicken! Definitely the best of Busan!
Gwangalli Beach and Gwangan Bridge,"Gwangalli beach is another famous beach apart from haeundae beach in busan. It has beautiful sand and you can see gwangan bridge from the beach. It is best to visit during night time because you can see the gwangan bridge light up. How to go thereIf you're from busan station take line no 1 to seomyeon. Transfer train line no 2. Get off at gwangan station. You can take exit 3 or 5.I took no 5. at the exit make like a u-turn(behind you). walk straight until you find a right (the road curves to the right if i'm not mistaken). After you re moving in the right direction, just walk straight to the beach. (please see google map for better visualization)"
a beautiful view on Gwangan Bridge,"...at night. And all these glittering buildings in the streets behind the beach. I got there when it was already dark, the bridge is a beauty and Gwangalli is the perfect spot to see it from. "
"Haeundae beach in the day time, Kwanganri beach at night. ","Haeundae beach in the day time, Kwanganri beach at night. Kwanan bridge is also make the beach more beautiful. This beach is more beautiful at night. There are many restautants and cafes beachside, enen if it is a little expensive. October there is fireworks festival at Kwangan bridge. "
Nice walk along the beach at night...,"Now I know why it's famous place for the young... if you're for a fresh air stroll, entertainment or maybe just want to kill time and do some people watching, i highly recommend this place. There are lots of cafe shops as well across the road if you need your daily doze of caffeine! And hey, it's just a 5 minutes walk from Gwangan Stn. E3 or 5. Just ask for walking directions from the stores or from the locals. They're all friendly. But if you're a group of 3 or more friends, you might as well take the cab :)"
"Nice place, would imagine it's packed in summertime.","Plenty of shops, bars, restaurants etc, nice busy place. Good views onto the city and the bridge. Boardwalk is good for a stroll."
Diamond Bridge Light Show,"The bridge at night when lid up was very pretty and I didn't know there is a light show at 8pm, 9pm or 10pm until I checked in at Swarm. One of the tips is the light show. So, grabbed some burgers or some food from nearby and enjoy the light show. The show is on for about 15 minutes, changing lights with the latest K-Pop songs. "
nice place to visit,"it is a nice beach and place for walk along the shore by the sea with many places to eat and drink and beautiful view over the bridge, i really enjoyed this place a lot."
Gwangalli Beach,"must go during evening, then you can see the different view from evening until night time! you can see the bridge light up during night time!"
Lively and Vibrant Beach Front,Gwangalli Beach over looks Gwangan Bridge and it lovely to go to at sunset. It offers hundreds of restaurants with different cuisines to pick from; Something there for everyone. The beach is nice but nothing spectacular. It's the bridge and the build up of the beach front that gives it its appeal. 
Relaxing spot after dinner,"The thing that distinguishes Gwangalli Beach from Haeundae is that Gwangalii looks prettier after sunset. Sitting by the seaside, you can enjoy the gorgeous nightview of Gwangan Bridge just right in front of you while sipping some beer or chewing on delicious Korean BBQ chicken takeaway. When we were there, there was even a street performer singing all night by the beach. Beautiful place indeed to chill."
Not a best beach to get wet,The view and location of this beach is awesome. The beach water looks a bit of muddy and very few people went in and got wet. 
A beach to remember.,"I visited this place at night, so here's a review on what goes on here when night falls ......Firstly, the fact that the beach sits inside a cove spanned by the Gwangan Bridge makes for some pretty pictures when the sun goes down, as the lights come on and the bridge becomes a sight to behold.Also, there were some people singing and making music near the beach (complete with drums, guitar and keyboard), which drew a supportive crowd consisting mainly of youths. The Korean love songs which were belted out really complimented the romantic atmosphere. No wonder the beach was dotted with couples from all ages.Be sure to check this place out if you ever find yourself in Busan; it's beautiful, it's clean, and it's a great place for pictures and relaxation."
Beautiful area,"Loved the long strip, the view of the bridge, and the combination of restaurants + beach. However, it's just a bit too crowded with traffic in that area, so I wouldn't stay in a hotel there...unless that's your thing."
Favorite Beach in Busan,I love Gwangalli Beach. It's a great area and less crowded that Haeundae Beach. It also has the great view of the beach. I suggest making a trip here. Don't forget to eat at Sharky's!
Great beach,This beach is a great place to walk and many places to see and have fun with friends. There are plenty of places to pick from in terms of food.
Next best beach after Haeundae Beach,"If you like lesser crowds, quieter and cleaner place, then Gwangalli Beach is for you. You get to see the spectacular view of the Gwangalli beach from the shore line. Try visiting this place at night to see the bridge lit up with lights. And the surroundings is turned into a very nice and romantic place. "
Excellent beach,"This is a smaller version of Haeundae Beach, it is worth going to with restaurants close by. We happened to arrive on the night of the 'Water gun' festival (16/8 ish) which made it well worth the experience, there were street performances on the parallel street, and all sorts of other engagable activities"
See the Bridge.,"Visit here, rent a tube and float in the water. Rent an umbrella for the day and relax. Skip over to Bella Citta for an amazing Italian brunch for 12,000 won."
great beach,"Very nice and peaceful beach during the day. I like it more than Haeundae because it's less crowded and cleaner. It also has the view of Gwangan bridge and many shops, restaurants and hotels nearby. I really enjoyed spending a day here. At night, it gets more crowded but it's still great for a visit because Gwangan bridge is lit up. Good atmosphere overall."
"It was a windy day, so the sea was rough.","Lots of hotels, and restaurants across the road. Nice promenade to walk along. Can hire beach umbrellas. "
Great beach and lots of activities,"You can enjoy jet ski, sailing, banana boat rides, walking on the beach, safe for children and close to everything."
Light-up bridge is the main attraction,"We visited at night and got a chance to see the bridge all lit up with LED lights. Every half hour, there is a 10-minute light show as well -- be sure to stay and experience it! Sitting on the beach and watching the bridge at night is a nice way to pass the evening."
Beautiful Beach of Busan,"I have been there last week on july 29, 2014. It was a great experience specially in evening when on gwangalli bridge lighting was turn on, wow it was very beautiful view a very long bridge and lighting on it. different demos were presented thought lighting. Beach side view in evening is awesome lighting every where and people ever where. mostly people were enjoying view and cool weather and some young people playing games and kids were doing fire work. Awesome place to enjoy cool nature and enjoy a food and coffee in beach side shops."
Best of Busan,"Complete different feel than Haeundae Beach. The view of the bridge is incredible, many restaurants, bars, and shops along the boardwalk. The night we went they shut the street down and had a festival, which I understand is common. "
Impressive View,"You can't miss the bridge from this location when lit up, a beautiful piece of engineering. The night I was here the road had been closed so had a very bustling vibe. There were entertainers spaced out along the beach including street dancing and a guy playing an electronic flute. Had a Yuzu frappe, while enjoying the bridge and watching the world go by. Recommended!"
Lovely Beach,"I stayed at homer's hotel which was right acros sthis beach. at night there were joggers and people threading the beach. The beach was a nice break for me... although i was in a business trip, i felt relaxed and felt blessed that the beach gave my mind peace.The beach was also overlooking the nice big bridge... forgot the name. So it was a nice frame to the spectacular view :)"
Great afternoon/night beach area,"Gwangalli beach was the first thing I saw in Busan, and I loved it! We arrived in the late afternoon and there was a beautiful fresh breeze coming off the ocean. We sat in a cafe looking out over the beach and fully relaxed for the first time in ages! I really love the cute little 'grass' island style umbrellas which are built into the beach. We came back here 3 nights in a row just because it was so beautiful eating dinner, walking along the beach, looking at the skyscrapers and admiring the bridge. I love the amazing variety of restaurants, cafes and bars which line this entire beach. It makes for a very fun night! Don't forget to buy some fireworks and sparklers from a street stall and let them off into the ocean.The area did seem to get quite breezy and cold at night (in late spring) so bring a cardigan."
Great Urban Beach,"Great beach for people watching, be sure to come down after dark to watch the bridge light show! We came down to the beach each night we were in Busan. On one of the nights there was a light show on the bridge every 30 min. "
Nice beach to getaway from the city,It is clean and has good access by public transport. The restaurants and cafes are supporting the infrastructure so that the visitors can relax by iewing the nice beach. It is best viewed at night to see the lights along the bridge.
Nice place at night,"It is interesting to visit this beach at night because you get to see a nicely lighted bridge in front of you beyond the waters. Just follow the crowd after leaving the subway station - most of them are headed there. Grab a cup of coffee and some snacks from the many cafes nearby and sit down by the beach area and enjoy the night breeze. Lots of teenagers hanging with friends and having fun. Vibrant, idyllic and relaxing place to be - best with friends or your other half."
Better & Quieter than Haeundae Beach,"Went to Gwangalli Beach for dinner and then proceed to watch the light show of the Gwangan Bridge.I prefer this beach to Haeundae Beach. It is more quiet with people playing with fireworks, street performers along the beach, and the rows of cafe opposite the beach, it is really a good place to chill and relax away from the hustle and bustle of Haeundae Beach."
Quieter alternative to Haeundae,"Preferred this beach to Haeundae. Quieter, cleaner and offering fantastic views of the Gwangandaegyo Bridge. There are also many restaurants, bars and convenience shops situated parallel to the beach which means you don't have to walk so far to get what you want. To the right of the beach as you look at it is a stage area where official and impromptu performances are held and if you keep going a board walk that's good for exercise and some great views. Well looked after by life guards"
Rent bicycle for free on right side of beach ,Look for the small hut near jet boat and apartment buildings Beach less crowed Tha other major beach 
Nicer than Haeundae,This beach is a much better alternative than the overcrowded Haeundae. There's a nice path above the beach great for walking/running/biking. There are plenty of restaurants with nice views of the water.
Nice beach,I went to Gwangalli Beach at night. Was really nice walking on the beach. The main star was the Gwangan Bridge (Diamond bridge) located right in front. There's light show at the bridge when we were there.
DONT BOTHER,we took the HOHO bus from Busan and we planned to get off at the beach resort but decided against it. The weather was misty (pollution?) and the beach area was dominated by huge high rises and the bridge. Glad we took the bus tour to see around Busan area.
Light Show,"We took the advice of others and made the trip to Gwangalli Beach to see the light show. The bridge begins to light up about 10-15 mins after sunset and then a laser show runs for approx 10mins. If you can grab a front row seat in one of the many restaurants, this will be an advantage because it will give you an uninterrupted view. We were on the boardwalk and had to contend with others walking in front of our camera shots ... having said that it didn't ruin any of our pics. It is well worth going to see. The beach and bay are very picturesque as well."
Pretty,Prettier than Haeundae beach! I prefer this to Haeundae beach. The bridge as a back drop makes it special and photo worthy!
Great views and relaxing beach area.,"I stayed for a long weekend at this beach area. It's not too crowded, and it's relatively quiet. The traffic may bother some. Try to grab an umbrella stand early in the day."
Diamond bridge,"the bridge is really beautiful. there has LED music show at night, so can plan to visit here around sunset and enjoy the LED lighting show."
A nice place to hangout at the evening,I like this place not because of the beach but there is a lot of cafe and bar around here. The price is reasonable and there are many international chain of cafe around here
Nice walk on the beach,Pleasant walk on the beach. Shiny sights of the bridge at night. Lots of restaurants to choose from in the area.
Beach / day out,"Nice clean beach with good view of the bridge. Plenty of caf√©s, bars and restaurants with good views.Plenty of shopping options including local markets.Waited a couple of hours longer to see the 3D light show of the bridge but it never happened which was a bit disappointing."
Cool,"I think Gwangan Bridge / beach was a better site than Haeundae beach during the time of our visit. It was raining when we went to Haeundae beach :) View was nice, and the place is clean. There were some good spots to sit along the shore"
Great at night,"This is a great place to go at night in the warmer months. There are lots of bars and places to eat close by, and there is a great view of the bridge which lights up. A definite place to see."
Great Night View,"Go Gwangalli Beach at night is the best for the night view. With colourful Gwangalli Bridge and the beach, the best to chill and relax at the beach and bring something to eat/go resturant near by to enjoy the moment. "
Night view for diamond brigde,"From the subway station walk about 1 km, 10 mins. May be we have a high expectation to the view we suppose to have, so there is a bit disappointing though. We spend less than half hours at there. The view is really nice actually, the better way is to get inside a coffee shop, grab some nice coffee and waffle and have a nice talk. it could be fanstatic"
Awesome beach with view of Gwangalli Bridge,"I went there for a view on day and night. light show with music by seaside and LED word show on beach, too bad in Korean which I can't read and understand."
great view of the Gwangan bridge,"The beach is clean, clear view of Gwangan bridge, quite beautiful in the evening-night time. Free wifi available in the area."
Night View,"Its very well kept. Theres a multitude of cafes across the street but you can go sit by the beach and have a picnic if its not freezing. If not, sit across the cbtl cafe across the street haha."
"Beautiful, very looked after Beach","Very clean & tidy beach, with beautiful fauna around, great views, amazing sightseeing.Overseeing new two floors bridge."
Beack Walk,"I love this long beach.. the bay walk is beautifully landscaped, complete with pine trees, and colorful flowers. The water is clean and the rest of the shore is really clean. at the other end of the bay walk, you will find a few fish vendors selling live fishes and other sea creatures while sea birds are patiently waiting for their part of the day's catch.. Adjacent to the beach are decent cafes, bars,restaurants, name it, they're there... The beautiful Diamond Bridge mark the horizon giving a truly dramatic backdrop especially as the evening falls and the bridge bursts into amazing display of lights. You should try jogging there in the morning or even at night time."
Nice Night View,we got lost finding Gwangalli beach after exiting from the Gwangan subway station. It is quite a distant walk from the subway to the beach. after arriving at the beach it is quite a happening street with lots of cafes and pubs. the lightings on Gwangali beach is beautiful.
Dirty,Beach was dirty and crowded. Only positive are the great pictures you can take at night across the water of the rest of the city on the opposite side. 
Great beach vibe!,"As some of the other reviewers have said, I prefer Gwangali to Haeundae beach--both are great, but I prefer the vibe of Gwangali. Great night scene and restaurants also during the day. Convenient drop-off point for the Seoul City bus and was a short walk from our hotel. We came across the beach and the hotel by happenstance and are returning in May 2014--great place!"
Beach with a bridge,"I have been to Haeundae beach before, and I actually prefer Gwangalli beach more. It's more peaceful and the view makes for nice photos. It's also relatively quieter than Haeundae. I went there on a winter morning, but the sun was out and it made for a nice stroll along the beach. It's also a short 10 minute walk from the subway station. There's also a recycling bin area with CCTV recording that ensures you sort out your trash correctly."
Lots of Gwangalli fun,"Nice beach, nice attractions, great features and markets nearby. This is one of several excellent beach areas in Busan, South Korea."
Now that's a bridge!,"This is hardly a peaceful getaway. The huge bridge, the first double-decker suspension bridge in the world dominates it completely. But if engineering is your thing, you'll enjoy the view! Lots of cafes and bars aimed at the young trendy or English teacher market but there are still grandmas gutting fish on the sidestreets."
Buy fireworks and see the bridge lightshow!,"We bought fireworks from the vendors at night for 1000 won and watched the lightshow on the bridge, which was accompanied by music. Really a great, romantic way to end an evening after dinner."
My favourite beach in Busan,"Gwangalli Beach has a good vibe to it - I can't wait to cruise around this area in summer. It has lots of bars/restaurants which face onto the beach - it reminds me of Coogee Beach (Sydney) back in the day. The views of the bridge are pretty spectacular during the day and evening. So far, one of my favourite areas in Busan. "
Nice view!,"Go in the evening to watch a nice sunset. Then, go to a cafe right opposite to have a piece of cake and a cuppa coffee to enjoy the cold breeze and view. "
awesome at night,we took night tour by bus at busan. and one of the place we alight wa gwangali beach . the bridge across was awesome so as the skyline.
Beautiful view of Gwangan Bridge,This is a excellent beach with a beautiful view of Gwangan Bridge. lot of activities at this beach in the evening. You will find many eating places along the beach. visit it in the evening & night.
Beautiful Beach and Not Crowded,We like to watch night view at Gwangali Beach as we can see light at Gwanggali Bridge and also colorful light around the city.From subway to here quite far it will take you like 10 - 15 minute walk but not very difficult to find it as you only need to take straight road till the beach.
Small but nice.,"Smaller than some other beaches around there, but it's got some beautiful night views with the bridges and the light shows and the boardwalk is great for a walk or a jog. The area is one of my favorites."
Not for tourists but for youth,"I love this place!Actually it is not really tourist attraction in my eyes, but a youth place!Maybe it's because I came there at night. So crowded, people laughing, having fun, holding small free performances as well.And the bridge is really beautiful~But just go when it's dark~"
Unique beach!,"I visited with a few relatives and was at Hauendae during the day, which was pretty crowded, and headed here around sunset. It's beautiful, clean, and a very pleasant walk - you also see the lights of Busan over the ocean, so it's a spectacular view. Tons of restaurants right across the street, definitely go to a seafood restaurant while you're here - fish isn't even my favorite, but it was amazing here. Prepared in every way, grilled, sashimi, in soup!"
Must visit at night,"Very relax and romantic place, comes at night and enjoy the breathtaking night view here with your love one."
Imagine this in your backyard,"To get to Gwangalli Beach, we walked from our hotel through the little streets & alleys - kinda undulating, hilly course. Lots of bars and drinking holes - pretty commercialised for tourists - but we headed for the kimbap shops - yummy rolls - filling and cheap. Easy to hold, no reheating required - perfect beach nosh! Coupled with Diamond Bridge cutting across the water, the beach projects a formidable view."
Sparkling Gwangalli,met Busan Oppa and had a lot of fun with him.. sitting infront of gwangalli beach.. enjoy pajeon and also odeng! the best odeng in Busan! i like it! its so awesome.. seeing sunset and had a lot fun in gwangalli..
I see what the fuss about the bridge is all about,"Gwangalli Beach is clean and easily walkable at a gentle pace. Went in the evening for a spot of dinner after walking the entire length (30 mins), checking out the many restaurants of both western and eastern origin. K Pop blares out from speakers on the road and the trees have pretty lights. All the buildings are lit up somehow but nothing compares to the bridge. It is amazing! The colours, the movement of the patterns and even some writing is flashed on the bridge. You really could stare at it for a very long time. Only 10minutes walk from Namcheon metro stop on line 2."
Where Busan natives experience the sea,This beach is not as crowded as Haeundae and has the famous bridge to frame it. Tons of bars and restaurants but try Sharky's on the western end for excellent burgers and beer!
"charming, go in the evening!","we headed to gwangalli beach at about 6ish to catch the sunset. must go to see the night view of the bridge. less crowded than haeundae beach. bring along a straw mat if you intend to sit there for hours to chill amongst the locals, have a couple of beers and some fried chicken. take a stroll along the beach.the night in busan is beautiful there!"
Night view,Worth the night view. But be prepared to walk a distance from gwangan train station. Nice fine sand. Good to go with your loved ones.
Very pretty,Relaxing. I could sit and stare for hours. Not as overwhelming as Haeundae beach. I enjoyed hanging out with the locals. If you have time you should stop by Sharky's.
better at night,"It was cool to see a beach what seemed like right in the city. But the water was freezing (more than Songjeong beach) and dirty. The sand was fine, but it was really loud with jet skis going all around for hours. The beach and bridge is pretty at night and not crowded at all. The beach was pretty busy during the day, but it looked like there were some good cafes and places nearby to eat."
fantastic beach resort,Loved this beach wish I had stayed in this resort. Not too commercialised but very scenic. The beach was really clean and in the evening the lights o the bridge and all the buildings are enchanting.
great for dinner with a view,We had dinner at sharky's with an excellent view of the bridge. It is a nice well-light bridge after dark.
"Busan,Gwangali,South Korea","This beach area is crowded with people on the beach during Summer July-August and temperature up to about 34degree. Food in Korea is not cheap if you compare to other Asian countries. Common meal is about 4500Won (USD$5) but good thing is,you can have unlimited refills of the appetisers,KimChi (pickle cabbage) and other condiments. Advise to book hotels online or else may find hard time looking for rooms. A 2-3star hotel can cost up to about 50,000Won. Bear in mind,most Korean does not speak English.Street food in interesting. Many western cafe,coffee house,Starbucks, Coffee Bean along beach road,as well as food and restaurant. You can do a city tour,about 90,000won (USD30) valid for the day,with 2 route,Hop-in, Hop-Out."
Nice views at night,"The beach itself is quite expansive with nice views of the bridge and the buildings surrounding it. It's better to go here at night to see the bridge and buildings all lit up with multicolored lights. Being from the Philippines, I've seen better beaches to swim and relax in to. But Gwangalli has its own charms, though I'm rather prefer to go to SpaLand at Centum City if I'm looking for a dip. Still, it's a perfect place to have a few drinks if the tent bars are open.There are numerous raw fish restaurants at one end of the beach, including ""the largest sashimi restaurant complex"" which I presume is Millak Hoe Town, where you can select your favorite sea creature and have it prepared in one of the many restaurants on its 9 floors."
Awesome! Nice scenery,"Nice scenery. You can capture some nice photos with the bridge and the beach, especially when you go there with a bunch of friends. You may need to spend hours along the beach. I went there during evening and manage to explore the night scene after taking dinner. Too bad the place doesn't have many choices for dinner and rather expensive. The taste of the food are just so-so. It is recommended to have your meal at other locations."
Long beach with nice views,"A proper sand beach, not a mud one like they can be found elsewhere in the region. The suspension bridge and city view from it is great. Unfortunately it can get littered and busy."
"not less crowded than Haeundae, nor nicer","Usually this beach is listed as a more picturesque, less crowded one, compared to neighboring Haeundae. The bridge views in the evening are nice, for sure. Go there for that! During the day, didn't feel like this beach itself has much to offer: yellow tubes are everywhere and it is super crowded, no place to swim due to only being allowed some 10-15 meters out (and the people with the yellow tubes). Most of the beach is covered with umbrellas and plastic recliners. Water has an unappealing shade of brown/gray and the nearby bridge, as picturesque as it looks at night when it is lit up, during the day just adds to the feeling of swimming in an industrial wasteland; the big ships nearby do not help either in making you want to swim or bathe there. Neither this nor Haeundae have showers that we could find or any place to at least clean one's feet from sand. Fortunately there are plenty of restaurants nearby so restroom facilities aren't missed that much."
Night scene is beautiful,"We went to Gwangalli beach after a crab dinner meal to explore the night scenes, especially to take the picture of the bridge. Walking through the lanes we came close to the end of the beach. Here I observe something very local and I like to watch this. There was a hawker cooking mussels at the corner of the street, many locals are ordering and eating from them. They delivered the trays of mussels to the "" picnic sites "" where they drink enjoy the seafood with their local drinks. It is not only for the elderly folks but also youngsters I groups. With portable BBQ stove and big bottle of Cass beer or Soju. They spent the night quietly gathering and enjoying the night with food and families or friends. As we walked down the beach and street, there are more eateries. Lines of cafe ( coffee chains) along the Gwangalli beach. There was also night boat rides along the beach. It is different from haeundae beach. I prefer haeundae beach better. Take good night pictures of the bridge in busan. This is the place."
Much more relaxing than Haeundae,"While it's worth checking out the spectacle of Haeundae, Gwangalli is a better option for actually spending a day/afternoon/evening hanging out at the beach. Nice sand, some free (though small and limited) tropical ""umbrellas"" for shade, and lots of restaurants and convenience stores nearby. Though I hear Gwangalli also gets really crowded in high summer (July/Aug) it was very quiet when we visited in June. "
Good when the weather is right,"Went there around sunset. The view is good when the sky is clear. There are people setting off fireworks at night (can be bought from sellers around). Shops and places to eat nearby, including a fish market at one end of the bridge."
Good evening,Went after sunset to see the bridge lit up. People had bought fireworks from the nearby store and were firing them off on the beach. The bridge and the fireworks combined made it a very nice evening to just sit on the beach and enjoy the moment. With a beer.
Average,"The buildings along this beach look old. It also has the feeling of being cramped because there is the bridge in front. In my opinion, Haeundae beach has a more expansive feel and it is newer and more vibrant."
Great View,The view is great and one can enjoy sea there at best. The bridge adds more to the beauty of beach. Lots of shops and restaurants located on the beach road so a good hang out.
great hangout place in busan,"there are so many restaurant, coffee shops, pub and bar along the Gwangali beach road. Just sit and relax in one of it when the sun set or at night, and see the colorful light of the busan bridge."
Underestimated,"Gwangalli beach area used to be seen as the poorer cousin to Haeundae but recently Gwangalli has really come into its own. The rapid expansion of bars, restaurants and coffee shops offers something for everyone. The water sport centre is a great place to pass away a few hours and Won and usually the beach in Gwangalli doesn‚Äôt get a busy and hectic as Haeundae during the summer. There are several festivals that pass through the area and the bridge at night with a few beers in hand and a firework or two in the other gives Gwangalli big thumbs up. "
"For Korea, it's a nice beach","I've been mainly to beaches in Southeast Asia, but since I live in Korea, I have to make do with what this country has. That said, I really liked this beach because of the laid-back atmosphere and recently developed boardwalk. One bar to hit here is Beached Bar run by the New Zealander Craig Morrison. It's a great place to just chill or spend time with someone. I highly recommend this place."
Relaxing walk along beach; great views of Gwangan Bridge,We spent the night at some hotel on the beach that was reduced half price b/c it was late October and cold. The views were wonderful! Seafood restaurants line the beach (very romantic) and strolling along the beach walk afterwards was very pleasant. At sunrise the next morning we departed and the bridge views were awesome...almost majestic even though it is a man-made structure. I would recommend this location as a nice place if you must spend the night in Busan. The city itself is typical large city...crowded and noisy so we found this outside location more relaxing.
