Get your Itch on at Icheon!,"This is a very small, but beautiful museum tucked in the hills of Icheon. It was free and a nice way to spend an hour or two. "
"Great Museum in Icheon showing rice, pottery and the history of the region",I love this museum. Many people who live in Icheon may not know this museum. The size is small but it has great collection of pottery and history of rice and region. Clean and calm to enjoy the museum.
Normal local museum,"C1 ( 2016.09.09 ) This museum was establish by Icheon City, and typically local museum. The museum was clean and not bad, but the contents was not different with another local museum. The facility and the atmosphere was good, and free entrance. The Icheon city was famous for ceramics, so there was some exhibits about ceramics. But I couldn't find more good with another local museum."
