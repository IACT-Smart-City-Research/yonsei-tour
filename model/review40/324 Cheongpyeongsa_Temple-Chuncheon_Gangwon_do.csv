"A very special place, the ferry and short hike add to its tranquility.","Major sections - entire temple complexes - were apparently destroyed in the ""Six-Two-Five,"" as Koreans refer to what what Americans call the ""Korean War, "" but what remains is still very beautiful, graceful and tranquil, with wonderful statues. Great bell, too, though it is rung only twice a day. Be sure to walk through the ""revolving door,"" a national treasure, and learn the story of the princess holding a snake, a statue on a rock in the river that you will pass on the trail."
Private Day-tour With driver guide ,"We visited the temple on 27/12/18. Our driver drove us to the foot of the mountain. As we hiked up the mountain along the stream. It was extremely cold.We stopped by a cafe at mid mountain to drink some freshly brewed teas & coffee before we continued our way up. The temple was really beautiful with lots of red colorful good wishing lanterns. However, we didn’t see the Buddha at the main temple as it was under repair."
"Dam, boat trip, temple and walk ","Other reviewers have provided some good detail but not so recently. This is our first day in Korea so hard to compare the temple to others. It was certainly beautiful and in a tranquil valley. We were a little rushed having caught a late afternoon boat from the Dam, we only had about 80mins to hike up to the temple and back. I'd recommend allowing longer and being able to soak up the ambience. We caught the 150 bus (11 & 12 are fine too) from Chuncheon station to Soyang Dam and had a nice walk there before catching the boat to temple end of the lake. The bus journey was as much fun as the sights... We had to hang on for dear life around the corners... I think Keanu Reeves was driving! To get back to the temple, I would recommend it. It's an easy walk on a fairly gentle incline. The walk to the viewpoint at the Dam is significantly steeper. "
It is good but not worth such a long hike,"You have to pay for ferry fare and climb about 30-40 minutes to get to the temple. Compare to its fame, it was not the best temple I have seen (as Korean). But if you want to experience the nature itself, it is a good idea to visit. The temple will be smaller than you think it is though."
"The temple is nice, the experience even better","Cheongpyeongsa is a very nice temple without a doubt, well located in the mountain. However, Korea has hundreds of those, and this isn't the easiest to reach, nor the biggest one. That being said, the process of going to the temple is what makes the temple really worthy of a visit. Take a bus to leave Chuncheon and reach the Soyang Dam, then a small boat to nicely cruise across the Soyang lake and arrive near the temple. Walk for a few hundred meters, and you'll reach an area full of laid-back restaurants for families and backbackers. Then, start going up the hill in the middle of the forest, while walking alongside a nice stream, and finally reach the temple. From the dam to the temple, it might take almost two hours, but these are two hours that you will really enjoy, allowing you to discover lakes, mountains, and kind locals in the process"
Temple of Karmic restraining order,"Cheongpyeongsa Temple was originally founded in the 10th century and has gone through several cycles of expansion and rebuilding. The oldest part of the temple is the main gate, which dates from 1555.Cheongpyeongsa Temple has a famous legend about a boy who falls in love with a princess. When the boy was killed for this, he reincarnated as a snake and attached himself (itself?) to the princess - an extreme case of karmic stalking. Obviously they tried to get rid of the snake but without success and she had to leave the palace to wander. One day the princess came to Cheongpyeongsa Temple and after sleeping in a cave and bathing in a pond, made a donation of some clothes to a local priest. This act severed the link between the princess and the snake (some sort karmic restraining order), and they built a pagoda to commemorate this deed. I am not quite sure what the story is all about but many of the natural and man made sights around Cheongpyeongsa Temple have some linkage with the story.It is quite difficult to get to Cheongpyeongsa Temple by public transport from downtown Seoul. You need to take the ITX train from Yongsan (or Cheongnyangni Station) to Chuncheon Station; then a bus to Soyang Dam; then a ferry across the reservoir to Cheongpyeongsa Temple; and then a 30 minute walk to the temple itself. One thing to note is that you have to walk about 10 minutes further from the Soyang Dam bus station to the ferry point.The whole trip would talk about 3 hours, including transfer time. There is a good tourist information kiosk just outside Chuncheon Station with detailed guides to the area in several foreign languages. The temple itself is interesting but probably not worth the trip from Seoul. However you can leave early and combine it with other activities such as watersports on the reservoir (Soyang Dam side) or a some hiking on the Obong Mountain, which is behind the Cheongpyeongsa Temple. I would recommend a hike but it is more challenging than it appears. You should be experienced and have the appropriate gear. Some sections are very steep and the paths along the streams can be dangerous.There is a number of restaurants at the bottom of the path to the temple. The local speciality is the pan-ried spicy chick rib. The last ferry leaves about 5pm and there seems to be some basic hostel near the car park if you want to stay overnight."
A highlight of my trip to Korea,"This temple isn't' easy to get to from Seoul by public transport but if you see travel as part of your experience, not just the destination, this won't bother you. The temple is a full day round trip from Seoul and well worth it.We went by bus from near Itaewon to catch subway train to get ITX high speed train to Chuncheon, then bus to Soyanggang Dam then a few minutes walk down to the ferry terminal to catch the ferry and then a lovely walk through the woods to the temple, maybe 3-4 km round trip back to ferry. The walk is shady once you get away from the ferry. The track, road really, is very obvious and it is all uphill. Only one small section was a bit steep but no bother to the 3 of us 60+ year olds. You go past a little water fall on your right and a pool where you can see the reflection of Mt Obongsan. Following the stream uphill you go past a statue of a lady in the stream bed; there are explanatory notes in English at the various points of interest but I can't recall her story. On the way you keep on seeing little cairns of stones. Add a stone and say a prayer/ make a wish. You know you are almost there when you see a little spring with water from a pipe falling into a stone basin with 2 communal plastic scoops to use to drink from. I didn't use the scoops but I did fill my water bottle there, and a week later I am still alive and kicking. The temple comprises a number of buildings, and yes, one of these is a toilet block. The other buildings are beautifully painted and as this was my first full day in Korea, I was overwhelmed by them and the thousands of differently coloured paper lanterns hanging. It is less than a month since Buddha's birthday, the occasion of the lanterns. My friend who lives in Korea says in some places the lanterns are only temporary but in others they seem to be there all the time. I don't know which is the case for this temple. There is also a little building recognising the pre-Buddha mountain spirit/s, apparently a quite common feature in temples. If you go up to the second story of the main building there is a window you can lean out off, a good photo opportunity for someone below with a camera. Oh, I almost forgot to say, on the way up to the temple there are little cafés in several spots, typical Korea, you are seldom far from an eatery."
Beautiful and unexpected!,Local bus from Chuncheon to Soyang Dam only took 20 mins we then took a ferry to the temple followed by a half hour walk - but well worth it! The pretty temple had hundreds of colourful lanterns hanging from the ceilings adding to the already colourful painted rooftops!
You have to,"The palace is one of the mana dory historical sites to visit in Seoul. It is a typical architectural style, but beautiful and scenic."
A Hike Worth the Effort,"A bus ride, a ferry, and a hike to the temple---we didn't know quite how long and steep the path would be...not for the really faint of heart...and probably not to be taken (as we did!) in the hottest part of a humid summer day. But the temple is truly lovely and serene, the ferry ride refreshing, and the bus ride enjoyable. So glad we made the effort!"
Well hidden gem above the lake,"This charming temple has a unique location due to the man-made lake nearby. Although a bit of a hike up the mountain from the dock, it's location along with the lake gives it some unique charm. The boat trip to this temple is also very scenic. "
