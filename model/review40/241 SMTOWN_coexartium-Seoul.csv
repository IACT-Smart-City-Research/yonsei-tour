Interesting place,I'm not a K-pop fan but I really enjoyed this place. There's a lot of CD players where you can choose and listen for free. It's really fascinating to see how k-pop evolves..
We had a blast,"From the museum, to the stores, to the art all around, to the different food shops, we had a fun time. Easy access from the train too. "
Interesting visit,"I am not familiar with K pop, but I enjoyed myself at SMTown seeing what the stars wore and their various performances. The cafe also sold yummy ice cream and their gift shop was very interesting and sold lots of cute stuff."
Awesome!,"A lot of fun, if you're into k-pop, especially the artist under SM entertainment. It give you a fun insight of their concepts and work !"
SM's Fan the best place,I couldn't forgot the time when I was there. My idol is Yunho so I could buy some products as well as took a lot of pictures in my idol's company. This is not memorable time in my trip. I will come back there again if I come back to Korea.
For the Fan and Uninitiated,"Went to the SM Town Building, right by the Samseong (Samsung) station as an accompanying parent to my teen.The lay-out is wonderful, and because we returned on the day of Typhoon Lingling, security has had the place secured, including double/triple knotting down the oversized signboard! IMHO, the museum is a cross between Mdm Tussaud (without the wax figurines), a shrine for the Oppa and ""biases"", and interactive 4G place...something for everyone.Even for the uninitiated parent, the exhibits are interesting... for me, a previous Banker, the phenomenal rise of Kpop in the world is an interesting case study, and way beyond just clever and sleek marketing!There is a 5-screen theatre on the 5th floor and requires a separate entry fee. From now till end Dec, there is a bundle for both the museum and the theatre. Check out the shows beforehand, and make sure you're early for the one that you'd like to view... else you'd be like us, having to come back a second day just for the Neo City screening. Details of the showtime, and featured artiste/band, are provided in their website."
Nice place for K pop fans ,It is a free entry. The minute you enter you will listen to the nice lovely love song. Has many floors but do go to the highest to take photos with your favorite stars and do the handprints with them. There is a cafe and shop that you could take photo too. Another great place to huge from the summer heat
A real paradise for fan,"A true paradise for K-pop fan from stickers, album, t-shirt, clothes,... Highly recommend to come here to enjoy Korean culture!!!"
Not so impressed.,"It was first time visit to K-pop stars mall.maybe I expect something special. But it is not like what I expected. I have two girls, one of them 12, one of them 8. I thought 12 years old one like this place since she starts like K-pop. Honestly she dose not know anyone there. K-pop singers are having world wide concert but they are not young anymore. There are no more new Idols picture on a wall. It has museum but entrance fee is not cheap so, we skipped it. We looked around star shops still no interest of them. Also quite expensive. Maybe if we see any concert this place may affect us. Place is not like what I thought."
for SM fans,"Because some of my family members were SM fans, we had to go to this place. It had a very extensive collection of clothing used by their various artists. For non (crazy) fans like me, some of their displays provided a glimpse of the stuff that goes on backstage, the preparations, the clothes, the make up."
SM Entertainment Artist Fan: Must go to place! ,"If you are a dedicated SM Artist Fan, this place would be heaven for you. You can even take selfies in the photo zone located on the fifth floor."
Perfect place for SM Entertainment fans,"If you are a fan of SM Entertainment, you must visit this place. I didn't have time to go inside and only visit the SM Store on the 2nd floor. They sold various souvenirs of SM artists so that it could be said this is a 'paradise' for SM fans."
"not a must visit, but quite the sight","none of us were really kpop (smtown) fans, but since this was nearby we figured we just dropped by. i think it is heaven if you love smtown, since there's a merch shop, music shop, a museum/exhibition (?) and theatre on top (to view past concerts, i suppose). it is also one of the stop for the hallyu stamp tour, which you can exchange for a small gift if you collect 5 stamps if i remember correctly. you can give this place a skip honestly if you don't care"
For Fans and in general,"Honestly if you are only an SM fan or generally curious about why so many fawn over Kpop idols - go there. It is a nice space to spend time in as they have a nice museum, a cinema to watch the concerts and a cafe and store. Also if you know a bit more about SM history, it is very interesting to observe how they treat their own history and that of bands."
Just For SM Fans,"The building has a few levels, including a museum and cafe. Merchandise of popular artists are either limited or sold out. Visit only if you like artists from SM Entertainment."
Kpop fans will love,"If you love kpop, esp SM artists, you will absolutely love this place. I like older generation kpop groups (SJ, TVXQ, Shinee) and so this was a great place to visit personally. Most is free, except the museum which was overpriced ($16), but I honestly don’t regret paying it and would do it again. Has a nice store and small cafe. I’m a long time kpop fan and so I’m a little older than most kpop fans (32), but I felt no judgement and there were ladies older than me there as well. Overall it was a nice way to spend a couple hours. "
Do head to this place if you are a SM Fan!,This place is definitely worth a visit if you are a SM Fan! A pity that the SM Theater was unavailable during my visit as it was booked for some play.
BEST,"The showroom is worth to visit. The best part is its free. Hahaha. There is a cafe, gift shop and museum. For museum you have to pay 18,000KRW"
Kpopers,"If yoou listen to kpop music especially SM entertainment artists, well this place is for you. Located in CoEx mall, this place is perfect for people addicted to kpop music. The building consists of a cafe, souveneir shop, a theather and museum. If your lucky enough maybe you can catch a glimpse of your favorite idol. I would recommend to watch School of Oz when you drop by this place."
A Gem,"If you love KPop, especially SM artists, this is THE place for you. I spent about 2 hours inside the museum but I could stay here the whole day and I wouldn't complain. There's so much to see (except the artists themselves hehe) and learn here . You'd come to realize that if it weren't for these artists (SuJu, SNSD, TVXQ, Shinee to name a few), KPop would not be where it is right now. Entry to the museum costs 18,000 KRW and it's definitely worth the money. If you don't want to visit the museum, you can go around the building itself. There's a cafe, market, a store, and a theater, and you'd also get to see a lot of the awards SM artists have won over the years. If you're a fan, check in advance if you'd like what's being shown in the theater so you could get your tickets ahead of time. Please note that SMTOWN @ coexartium is at a different location from SM Entertainment itself. The agency building is about 10-20 minutes away by train, if I'm not mistaken and is also worth a visit if you have the time."
SM Town Only,"If you really loves the artists of Smtown, this will be a must go place for fan. You may not need to buy a ticket if you just want to go to cafe or their shop. The museum is lined up the history of their artists, some AR facilities let you take picture with yout favourite artist. Of coursr you need to pay for the print out. Entry to the museum also need to pay. The cafe is packed with fan exchanging photo cards. If you just a tourists you may find yoirself out of place if you just want to have a speciality artist drink and take a leg break. The fan there will move around you looking for an exchange. "
Interesting place to spend time on a rainy day ,"It was raining/snowing. SM Town is an enclosed place conviently linked to the subway, mega cinema, shopping and aquarium. Good place to spend a day learning about k pop culture during bad weather."
"Experience AR photos with EXO, Super Junior, Girls Generation","SM Town was an amazing place for K pop fans. For non K pop fans like me I truly enjoyed the new experience of AR photo and vedio with K pop stars. Different rooms has set up at the museum for different bands. Once you stepped into the room pressed the button. The stars virtual image will show up in the television sitting, standing, singing next to you.So much fun! You can buy USB with all the photos and video @KRW30,000.There was audition room and dancing studio if you like to experience to be a singer. SM town allows me to learn the K pop culture. Have a great afternoon tea with my friends. Cake was beautiful! Love it! Must go!! "
Great place for fans of SM artists,"I love the place and can easily spend hours here at times. As you can see it is a SMTOWN shop so you can only expect to find SM Artist merchandises here like EXO, SHINee, TVXQ, Red Velvet etc.The desserts at the cafe are definitely overpriced so I've never tried them, but the coffee is not bad and you can choose the option that let you bring back a themed bottle of your favourite group. A great choice for a souvenir.Had a chance to watch one surround viewing for EXO Exordium and I would have to say it was amazing. I've watched Exordium concert live 3 times by the way and still enjoyed every bit of the surround viewing.You can expect lines into the SUM Store during artist comebacks, concerts or special events by the way. Usually clears up by lunch.I saw EXO's Chanyeol when I was there, cause he had an official birthday party event at SMTOWN Theatre for some lucky fans"
Coex SM Town (코엑스 SM타운),"I’ve been for many time here. It was my 4th~ I like KPOP but only SM Entertainment artis ㅋㅋ There are many pictures and stuffs about their artists. You can also buy something from their store. It’s free entrance, but you have to buy tickets for some place (ex: SMTown Museum). Really recommended!!Foto-fotonya banyak banget, dan untuk SMTown Museum itu tempat koleksi album, beberapa baju konser, dan lagu-lagu mereka juga secara random diputar. Puas lah kalo penggemar SM datang kesini haha"
Not a fan of K-Pop here,I went there because my friend is a K-Pop fans and I also want to visit the starfield library in Coex Mall (SMTown Coexartium is right beside the Coex Mall). I must say that it's just an ordinary building full of pic of SM talent. We visited the shop only and all of the things inside is so expensive
Pricey and line up,This is pricey and the stock isn’t that good. Very limited variety of the popular idols. Definitely not worth going and overpriced
Nice but pricey,"If you are not a Kpop fan then don’t go there, its not worth it. Everything is pricey even the cafe ... But definitely a Kpop fan have a hard time leaving this building... because there are so much stuffs to buy and so many eye candies... "
Perfect spot for K-Pop afficionado,This place become the most liked by my daughter during our visit to Seoul. All things about K-pop groups managed by SMTown is in this place. Warning: 90% visitors in this spot is girls . 
I'M SHOOK AS A FAN!,"I've always wanted to go here and when I finally got in, it was amazing! For a big fan like me, it was even more special! There was a Netflix event when we got there so we were able to get a glimpse of the cast of ""BUSTED"". Went shopping at the SMTOWN store, went to the SUM CAFE and took so much photos! GLORIOUS!!!"
Best place for SMStan,This place is a really good place for people who like SM.. well you can buy a lot of SM goodies and also some of Korean souvenir in here too.. There are mini supermarket for SM snack and also there is SM cafe in here. In here there is also a theater for SM “drama”
Best place for a SM fab,"I spend so much money here but if you buy a discover seoul pass in the 5th floor, you will save a lot of money. They give you a surrounding view entrance, museum ticket and discount on your photos. I went to SMtown almost 5 times during my month in Korea "
Overpriced but a unique museum,"The SMTOWN complex is visible once you exit the Samseong station by following the Coex Mall arrows. The museum itself is on the 3rd floor and costs 18000 won to enter. Inside the museum are several foyers with displays of the many favourite KPOP groups. The gift shop and market place can be accessed without the entrance fee. The merchandise and baked goods in the market are also quite overpriced. If I was 40 years younger, I probably would have been ecstatic to be surrounded by Idol memorabilia and life size posters. For me, it was an interesting couple of hours. I enjoyed the history of KPOP and the uniqueness of it."
Here is the place for you ELFs,"You just need to find Coex Mall, and you are there. Lots of picture and stuff about idols under SM Ent. Great cafe with good taste sweets. I love to be seated on the chair signed by Lee Donghae. hehehe. And you can compare your hand with idols. I recommend you to try heechul hand. OMG! how I wish I can hold his hands live. It really soft. Trust me!! "
SM FANDOM HAPPY PLACE!,"Well, everything you need to keep up with your KPOP - SMTown related collection is here! From albums to HUGE posters and a cafe with very expensive artist related food are all in this glorious place. They also hold some events with some of their artist coming around. Really, you need to check out this place if you are into SJ, SNSD, f(x), EXO and etc. ;)"
KPOP fan? Love SM? This is the place for you!,"As a former fan of KPOP, I found myself in Gangnam and thought, why not check this place out? I'll be completely honest, even as someone who has moved on from the ""fandom"", I found a lot of the building to be super interesting. The cafe has great cupcakes and ice cream, and if you're able to, I would highly recommend checking out one of the pre-recorded concerts they play in their theatre. Overall, it's a really interesting environment, even if you just have time to walk around and check out their store/cafe."
EXO SHOWTIME🇰🇷,You must go before you regret it....Its so (YEPPUDA)........ for all fanZ...I hope you can go somewhere especially SMTOWN....
Only for the SM entertainment fans (kpop),"This humongous modern fancy building has many interesting things if you are a fan of the SM groups. If not, it doesn't seem worth at all."
You will only like it if your into K-Pop,"If your into K-Pop or you have teenagers who are into it it is worth visiting , the exhibit will take about 60 to 90 min max , some interesting stage costumes and some things used by celebrities.It’s not free cost about 15 USD each and price is fixed for all ages, also the ticket desk didn’t accept American Express .Nice k-pop theme coffee shop with the worst coffee and a nice gift shop.Any how If your in Seoul might as well visit "
Join the kpop fans,"This is the place for kpop fans. There are queues to get into the souvenir shop and it cost to get into the museum so we didn't bother. Seeing the fans milling around the cafeteria to buy a drink bottle with their favourite group's likeness or a cupcake (9,500kw!!) with their group's name on it. it was fun to get a button badge or wristband from the coin machines.At the top level you can find a couple of activites to entertain you (a love match machine with a kpop star!!) "
A Kpop must see,We enjoyed visiting SMTOWN Coexartium....it’s truly a kpop little heaven;especially to fans for the groups of SMTOWN..... A very well organized small caffe...you buy many fancy choices of personalized stuff there...surely worth a visit.
SM fans must go,因為SJ Heechul，我去了SMTown參觀，樓高6層有cafe+精品，有theatre又有museum。Museum/theatre都需要收費入場，但絕對值得參觀。Museum有間recording studio，可以入去試做歌手唱K，好有趣的體驗。SM飯必到景點！
Unique place in Gangnam !,"It is area of entertainment like artist label, with unique architecture and building. SM Town 2nd floor Gift shop is so crowded that the queue too long for us to wait. It is Sunday maybe. 3rd floor is museum with admission ticket. 4th floor is Cafe market with snacks and ice cream, and few souvenirs to buy."
Kpop Lovin’,This is a good place to visit for all Kpop fans and even the not k-pop fans. I had fun a this place seeing all k-pop group of sm entertainment. sm entertainment has really mastered marketing their k-pop groups. they have really good marketing strategy. 
A happy place for Kpop fans,"The first stop of our Seoul vacation was at SMTOWN as my daughter is a huge fan of Kpop groups. Upon arriving we saw a long line of girls who are joining the fan meeting of SHInee. In this building they have a store where you can buy albums, merchandise and souvenirs of famous groups like EXO, Red Velvet, SHINee, TVXQ, Girls Generation, F(x), NCT, etc. Interestingly the original and quality merchandise you can find here are sometimes cheaper that those items we bought at Myeongdong and during our underground shopping walks in Seoul. They likewise have a museum where they have several photos of artists. Indeed a fun and exciting place for my little lady :)"
Fun place to visit,A place where your kpop dreams come true. Happen to catch EXO'rdium surround viewing and it was great!! Did not know that the museum on Level 3 requires ticket to enter but all was fun!
I went there with my friends that were SM fans,I did make a lot of pictures and I had lots of fun. I could take pictures with my favorite singers and see the miniatures. Also I could shop for stuff with my favorite singers. I think hat place is nice and has nice vibe also.
a place for SM Artists fans,"easier to go via Exit 6 at Samseong Station. Once you go out of the exit, you will see the ""SMTOWN"" immediately. this place is only for those who love k-pop and the artists. People who don't like it, may find this place is boring."
Great free attraction for Kpop lovers,"I know most of the visitors go there to buy merchandise (a whole floor of the building is dedicated to that), so it's not free, but I was happy I got the chance to go around the building for free *unlike MBC World* . All the walls are covered with artists pics, trophies they won, and obviously their music in the background, so you can take tons of photos with them ;)My parents had nothing obviously to do there, that's why I gave it a 4/5.  It's pretty close to the COEX mall, and there are a few shops also just outside the SM Town building. "
waste of space,"for an atrium that is supposedly specialising in sm artists, you would think that there would be more merchandise on offer. that's what any reasonable business would do. all the people who go there are fans of sm artists and of course they will be on the hunt for merchandise. sadly, there is very little by way of merch. an afternoon in myeongdong will get you more goodies than here, and that's truly a missed opportunity. instead, you get things like candles and socks and whatever else is allegedly 'recommended' by the artists. there is a cafe, but seoul is full of cafes. apart from that, there is a studio which will do your makeup and have a mini photoshoot - essentially, you can play at being a kpop artist for a while. you have to book about a month in advance and it isn't cheap. if this is something you're into, then it's worth coming here. otherwise, just allocate about half an hour to walk through the place and ogle at posters of your favourite artists/bands."
KPOP Hot Spot,"SMTOWN is definitely a hot spot for young KPOP lovers, especially those groups under S.M. Entertainment like EXO, NCT, Super Junior, Girls' Generation, Red Velvet, Shinee, and f(x). There are 6 floors and the attraction markets itself as being a ""theme park in the city"". The first floor is the welcome area and the second floor is the SUM (Celebrity) Shop where you can purchase memorabilia from your favorite S.M. groups. The third floor is the S. M. Studio and the fourth floor is the SUM Cafe and SUM Market where you can purchase S.M group consumables. [Note: There is another SUM Cafe at S.M's Communication Center location]. And the fifth/sixth floors is the SUM Theater where there are different hologram showings of concerts, plays, and other special projects. A die-hard KPOP fan could spend all day here and the average tourist like myself spent 1-2 hours."
Kpop Theme Park!!,"If you like K-Pop especially SM Entertainment artists... then this is your K-Pop Disneyland!!Several floors of lots of SM artists pictures. Huge gift shop selling all SM merchandises. There is SM Cafe selling desserts and beverages. Love their cupcakes, they even decorated with SM Kpop group names on top. One floor is all about SM Studio. The top floor is print shop and theater for showing Kpop concerts. There is also a photo booth that you can take pictures with the celebrity.The print shop, photo shop, theater, studio are all additional charge."
KPOP LOVER HEAVEN,"First of all, I'm a big fan of kpop, so I obviously highly enjoyed it. Since it is SMTOWN only expect to see SM artists merch there. If you love SM artists there is so much merch there, it is kpop heaven. Most of the albums are available as well as posters, shirts, cosmetics, phone case, bags, stickers, pillows, signed goods, hats, key rings, and much much more! There are 6 levels, but I only went to 2 levels: the main area which has all the merch and the cafe level. The cafe served cute pastries and cakes and some of them had the groups names on them. I did not purchase anything from the cafe, but it looked good. I went at a quiet time so it was quite empty and very comfortable and aesthetic looking. There is also SM artist food that can be purchased, which is pretty cool. It's a very modern and stylish area, with great design and decor. It is also conveniently located in the coex shopping centre in the high end district of Gangnam. My one complaint is that the merchandise is quite pricey, but that is to be expected, especially since it is located in a high end area as well. It is quite easy to get to and there are many shops and restaurants around the area. I highly recommend going to the SM store if you are a kpop fan as there is so much to buy and see!"
A must go for Kpop Fans (particularly fans of SM artists),"I was so excited to visit SMTOWN coexartium and it definitely lived up to my expectations. When coming to Coex, I got a bit lost so I lost a bit of time but remember SMTOWN is next to the Coex buildings and if you ever do get lost ask the information desks inside Coex and they will give you a map to help you. Now back to SMTOWN, this place was definitely something I recommend for fans of SM artists as there was so much shopping you could do: you could buy loads of merchandise (which I did indeed) for quite reasonable prices and you could also buy food from the cafe and experience 3D hologram concerts too which was quite spectacular. You also get to see autographed items, posters and trophies won by the artists. Definitely worth a visit!"
For the love of kids,"Giving in to my kids' incessant prodding, I got dragged to any teenager's (who's into KPop) must visit in Seoul. It's 6 stories of Kpop heaven for the kids w/a cafeteria, official merchandise outlet, theaters and audition area, if you or your kids are up to it. The commute is a cinch as it is connected to Samseongdong station. Parents should worry not as they can while their time away at Coex underground mall while the kids wallow in Kpop ecstasy. "
Coex,Good options for shoppaholics. Great location in Gangnam. There are a couple places to eat as well..
Overrated and not what we expected ,"We are fans of SM artists so we were anticipating our visit to SMTOWN coex but unfortunately we were disappointed with the eventual visit.The place has about 6 levels or retail, activities and F&B but everything was a little lacklustre and the posts we see on social media were kind of overrated. We were expecting it to be more interactive, but the atmosphere felt quite dead (perhaps because we were there on a weekday afternoon). I would recommend this to anyone who is looking to buy lots of merch and collectibles - but other than that, there isn't really much to see.I wouldn't go twice."
KPOPer!! its your place (if you really like SM!),"2 hours will not be enough if you are hardcore kpop fanatic! this is SM heaven! you can just enter the place and feast your eyes and soul. you don't even have to buy anything, just be in there is enough! of course if you are kpop fanatic, you will not be empty-handed when you walk out from here.. hehe"
For youngsters and fans,Not exactly my cup of tea but I happened to be there at COEX and decided to walk around exploring. Recommended to youngsters and teens.
"if you're a SM fan, its a must come.","Stayed at the Grand InterContinental Seoul, thus it was exactly next to SMTOWN Coexartrium. I visited around 3PM on a weekday and it was crowded. There were a lot more Korean customers than foreign customers. Some of the staff could speak Chinese, English and Japanese, so try to spot them. However the staff are not the friendliest bunch. The second floor is the SUM store, i felt like they sold more things that were ""recommended"" or used by SM idols than actual SM merchandise. The display was everywhere (all exo stuff are not grouped together) only signs on table. However if you are looking for albums or DVD's that are old, you can probably find them here. It was crowded, thus hard to shop so go early. 3rd Floor was the SUM Cafe, limited chairs, so it was really hard to get a seat. Maybe take the cakes to go and eat it outside the building. Price was reasonable. The rest of the levels were a museum, theater, 3D printing and photo booth. There is also a counter to purchase concert goods (depends on availability). Summary, it definitely felt like going to a SM museum or theme park and as an SM girl made me feel like exhilarated. However once you've seen all of it, it won't be exciting coming again. The products were less than i was expecting, quantity wise."
SM,"If you love SM and its artiste than this is a must visit, Many merchandise are on sale.And the awards and photos are all displayed here. If you are a kpop fan but not a SM fan than you might want to skip this and visit the other agencies."
Teens n K pop EXO fans must visit ,"This is a destination that K pop whom loves SM entertainment artists must visit. Was here because of my teenager whom loves EXO. We actually had a hard time looking for this place as the landmark was not clear. COEX Aia a very big area connecting offices, conventions and shopping. This building is next to the COex shopping. We spent a good 2 hours here as we were earlier at SM entertainment building. This place is a little different from SM entertainment building There ar at least 6 levels. Cafe, merchandising, 3 D cinema and hall of fame and a salon ( which is not operating at this moment as Licence is expiring and this need to book in advance by 2 weeks ) Come prepared to spent money. SM has very good marketing strategy. From cosmetic, posters, clothes, food and beverages, stationary and posters , they offered a range of varieties. Each star even endorsed a certain facial or food items. The hall of fame is interactive and interesting. There are hologram cinema, larger than life size posters, palm and finger matching machines and etc. I can't imagine how many awards that SM artists had won throughout the one decade. Their awards lined the full length to length of the floor and shelves. Those whom love Girls Generation, you willNot miss the display of their wardrobes of clothes and bags and shoes whom they worn for some of the concerts. Walk the TOP floor and spot your artists palm mold n signatures . It is framed in gold and sign in gold. "
For Sm fanatics,"Very good place to visit if your a Smtown fanatic. You may even get lucky and see an sm artist. It's mostly shops and cafes in the building. You can buy lots of fan merch. On the top floor I didn't get to go , but you pay to see some more sm things . "
KPop lovers must visit.,"An experience of close up huge view of Kpop stars via their huge screen and wonderful sound system. Giant size posters and even customizable we-fies with your favorite stars. Unless you intend to watch the concert or chill in the cafe, I recon an hour walk around will sufffice."
"If you're into SM artist, you don't miss this. ",Actually there're a couple of sm shops in seoul but this one is definitely their biggest. Their SUM shop is on the second floor selling official goods and some goods that are used or recommended by sm artists. There are few concert goods too. I don't know if it was made into permanent line or were there leftovers. Their third floor is a studio. I didn't enter this but I heard you can buy a course to take kpop idol style shoots and stuffs like that. Fourth floor is their cafe and market. Pricey f&b. Drinks are okay tasting. The gimmick is that for every table and chairs there will be signatures of artist written on it. Their market sells everyday goods eg chips and chocolate with an artist collab. But you enjoy market I would recommend the one in sm building in cheongdamdong as it's a bit bigger. 
K-pop heaven!,Absolutely loved my stay here. I am a huge SHINee fan and I really enjoyed seeing their photos and being able to buy original merchandise. My highlight was the Exo concert in Surround Viewing. I was not a huge Exo fan but the show was amazing. It's like you are at the concert but with more comfortable seats. I'm still in Seoul and thinking of going again. A ticket was only 19.000 (about 15 dollars) for a show that lasted more than 2 hours. Money definitely well spend. The only thing is that there are no subtitles so you can't follow the speeches in between songs. But it was still fun.
Delight for any fan of kpop,"Came here on a weekday and there it wasn't crowded, but impressed with what i saw. The fifth floor was the highlight with their hologram theater, i was hoping they'd have a SNSD concert film but turned out to be a shiner concert. Check their schedule to see what film is playing on the day you're goingThere was some cute photo booths, and a floor dedicated to looking like a pop star and sounding like one. Their cafe and shop was cute as they had products named after their stars, and i aw BoA chips and ice cream which i got. Their merchandise shop didn't have a hige selection like i wanted thoughWorth a visit if you like smtown artists or kpop in general"
Heaven for SM Stan :D,"This place is very luxorious, it's SM indeed. each floor has its own uniqueness. SM coex cafe is really cozy and beautiful, good choice to get relax and rest after strolling around coex mall. "
😀,"This is a great place to visit if you like kpop. The have a nice café that you can sit down at, while your teenager runs around looking at those attractive korean singers."
Brings out your inner fangirl.,"Stopped staying up-to-date with kpop in high school but recently got into EXO, and let me tell you, even just having one favorite SM group is enough for you to enjoy SMTOWN CoExartium!There are 5 floors, each one advertising/showing different SM products. Reasons why I loved it here:1) The concept of this place was pretty clever. SM really knows how to make the most of their artists' fame. If you want to see how a company markets their celebrities and make them popular, come to this place! The structure of the store makes it fun even just to look around.2) Pictures of SM artists everywhere. You know how fashion magazines have beautiful pictures that people like to flip through? This is the same idea; really cool photoshoot ideas on every floor, everywhere you look. It's really like SM's own version of a fashion line/magazine.3) It's actually really chill. The first time I went was a weekday and there weren't much people. The second time I went was a Saturday and it was filled with teens just hanging out.There are also shows going on in SM Theatre. Just look at the schedule to see which past concerts are being shown for the Surround Viewing (19,000 won per person). Tickets weren't sold out, and we were able to buy them a little bit past the 20 minutes before the show started (contrary to what the website says), probably because it was a Friday. I watched the EXO PLANET #2 The EXO’luXion one, and it was VERY cool! Definitely worth it, since I currently can't go to one of their real concerts.I agree with one of the reviews below though: SM CoexArtium is worth a visit if you've ever been a huge SM kpop fan (or if you really want to see how much of a thing kpop idols are in South Korea) ^_^."
