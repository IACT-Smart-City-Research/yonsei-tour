good place,Beautiful place! Should come if you vistit to Jeju. You will not regret. Excactly thing i want to say. 
Fascinting glimpse into mythical past,"I love the wallet-friendly admission prices to the Korean government's tourist attractions. Some are even free, come with English-speaking guides and/or tablets with headphones with information.This one had info boards and cards but it was in a beautiful setting, a mini forest in the middle of surburbia.The exhibits, including a short 3D film, tell the story of the mythical origins of settlement of Jeju built around some original artifacts.You get to go close to exhibits and there's also an opportunity to dress in a scholar's robes for a photo in a study.Staff are very helpful and friendly and the place is wheelchair friendly. It is easily accessed by public bus or taxi."
Interesting introduction of Jeju,"Three mysterious stone falls on the ground, resulting in 3 holes... from the holes rise three men... and in time, Jeju is born... Such folklore may only appear in books, but in Jeju, there are evidence of the same, preserved into a real interactive museum.. Remember to watch the 3D movie and visit the sakura during spring time."
Museum for kids,"As a foreigner visiting jeju, this museum may not be enough. However, if you have kids, this place is great for them to learn a little about jeju and mostly the animals you can find on jeju. They had an experiential section where you can try on the olden days clothes, carry the traditional rug bags and even checkout how their toilet used to look like. It's an okay place to kill 1-2 hours for. Do try the ice cream at the cafe in the museum, decently priced and taste so good."
Decent collection, Jeju Folklore & Natural Museum - Not that great but it was a good time to browse through the collection to understand the local beliefs and style of living in the older times.
"Not very impressive but good for only 2,000 wons","It is a small museum (Jeju is small anyway) but it provides a lot of information about the island itself (volcanic history, animals, marines, and so on). Not very impressive comparing to other big museums elsewhere but a good place to visit in Jeju. "
"2,000 won entrance fee and it's far more than the price.","2,000 won entrance fee. Water and private locker available for free. Locker near the main gate. You can go to the park near directly from there.It has more things to see but as a Korean it was not new. In many ways the exhibition was very similar with what I have ever seen in other National Museum in Korea.But considering the price, just about 2 dollars, worth it.Exhibiting people's life, nature, insects, animals and so on."
Good range of properties,Amazing that it is free! Beautiful painted buildings and a big range of more ‘ordinary’ buildings and traditional houses.
Thorough introduction to Jeju’s natural and cultural history,"We visited this museum as our first stop in Jeju and found it to be the perfect introduction to the island. They have modern and interactive displays which are well constructed and maintained. The museum is very thorough and covers all aspects of Jeju’s natural and cultural history, from formation of the island to marine animals, to festivals and farming."
A peak into fairytale Jeju,"As we came during the cold snowy season, my sister and I were pretty limited in our choices of attractions we could visit. Come snow storm time, we felt pretty happy to be able to visit this place. Entry price at 2000krw (for Australians - not sure about other's as the admission clerks asked us where we were from before charging).We took our time to look at every exhibit, read the descriptions and also watched the folklore surrounding how jeju was thought to have been formed. The snow added a special touch to the melancholy feel of our whole experience and we ended up spending almost up to 1.5 hours here. Make sure to take the map of this museum before entering as we would've certainly missed a couple exhibits otherwise.If you're feeling peckish afterwards, there is a lovely jeju traditional noodle house opposite the road which serves beautiful range of noodles that will warm the soul, especially on a cold wintry day such as today."
Quiet and serene environment,There is a small admission fee but there was nothing much to see. The surroundings gardens were pleasant but this could be because of the extremely cold December weather. We only stayed around for less than an hour and left as soon as the next hourly Jeju City Tour bus arrived. There were not many tourists and only some teenagers on a school excursion were there.
Must-do introduction to Jeju Island,"Fabulous museum introducing visitors to the nature and culture of Jeju Island. We learned a lot! The story of the founding of the Island was fascinating, as well as the reproduced lava tubes, the displays of taxidermy wildlife, dioramas of human culture and the outside gardens and stone displays. "
All of Jeju Under One Roof,"The museum consolidates a wide array of the social, historical, agrarian, seafaring, and geological features that make up the entirety of Jeju. This allows the museum goer to survey the offerings of the island and then plan their travels about the island in order to visit specific parts of the island and see them first hand and in greater detail"
Jeju History,Good insight into the unique history that is Jeju. If you already know quite a fair bit about Jeju then it might seem repetitive but definitely interesting for newcomers! Entry is not expensive either.
Informative place to visit,The visit to Folklore & natural history museum was very informative. It traces the history of how Jeju island was formed thru videos and graphic presentations.The displays were life size & shows the various customs & lifestyles. Thre were also displays of migratory birds etc.The surrounding gardens were serene & good for picture taking.
Good Place to educate oneself about the historical side of the island,"Despite being there on a rainy Autumn day, we enjoyed exploring the whole area by ourselves. Its has been a very educational trip to know about the past and we had an memorable time at this museum."
Get to know more about Jeju,"Got to read and see more about Jeju, its formation and history. The display on the different types of lava, oranges, childhood games etc were interesting.Another area displayed more exhibits on whales, abalones etc. Again, it wasn't too crowded so I quite enjoyed a stroll through the place."
Not much folklore at the moment,Part of the place(probably the folklore section) is closed for renovation. There is also a Maritime Exhibition Hall with the replica of the largest Bryde whale bones in Asia on display. We were there on a Wednesday and was told entrance was free. Unsure if it's a daily or Wednesday only offer.
Simple and enjoyable,Took public transport to the location. I must say it was quite a distance! Entrance was free and we could go in to roam the exhibits. It's nice as it was a first time in Jeju and it became our introduction. Cherry blossoms park was just right beside the museum which was quite scenic when viewed from within.
Not great,"Went there with a Celebrity shore excursion. For what we paid, skip it, there's not much there. We could have been done in 20 minutes. Best part was the introduction film, and the clean Western bathrooms."
Haenyeo Women Divers,"Although the museum presents many facets--marine life, soil and rocks, fauna and flora, lifestyle, traditional housing, rites of passage and food specialties, the most intriguing exhibit is the diving tools used by Haenyeo women divers, farming tools used by farmers, and stone structures made by the volcanic rocks. Our tour guide's mother is still a diver at age 75. The oldest diver is 96 and is still active. Each woman diver goes down without scuba gear two minutes before coming up for air and dives 4 hours each day for abalone and other fish."
Cultural museum of historical life in jeju,"We were taken here as part of our day tour through Hana tours of jeju island in November 2016. Our guide discussed some of the exhibits with us. There is a model of the island showing the different climates. There wee exhibits of different wildlife. Then there was a lava tube to walk through too. Then after going through a small courtyard, there is a large room with figurines depicting life from birth, marriage, and daily life activities in jeju. There was an exhibit with a large boat for the fishing done in the past. Also, there was an exhibit of female free divers for shellfish which is still done today because our guide's mother still partook in this activity. It was a cool, windy day so it was nice to get inside."
Museum of culture and history of Jeju,"There is a short path before getting into the museum. In the path, many kids with their families played together, running, enjoying traditional games like ttakji. It seems that Korean families would like to have their family activity day in that certain place. In the museum, it contains waxworks which shows Koreans’ traditional culture of manners (how the greetings be and how the gender inequality be in the past) and how the living environment like in the ancient times. It also put lots of Jeju’s specialty – stones. Stones is common in Jeju and is distributed around the whole city. The museum shows different kinds of stones with descriptions, including those animal-like stones and the rare one, those stones-enthusiasts must fall in love with it.So, if you want to learn more about the history of Jeju and have enough of time (just spend about an hour), you are recommended to go there to have a lesson of Jeju."
Folklore & Natural Museum,Great place as an introduction to Jeju especially if you are short of time. Get to understand local culture & natural attractions in one place. Good exhibits with english translation. Miniature Seongsan Illchulbong (Sunrise Peak) & Manjanggul Cave on display. Good place for a great geography lesson on volcanic activities & resulting landforms. Museum is one of the Golden Bus City Tour stop.
Nikce intro to local culture,The folklore part of this museum was surprisingly good illustrating local culture. The natural museum was not particularly enlightening. Lots of English
Great museum with excellent explanations (in English),All exhibitions were nicely arranged and the explanations were very educational (for a range of ages). 
Good museum visit,"Good 45 minutes to spend. It give you the idea of the Jeju-history, food and habits. Not expensive and good to take a rest on this beautifull isalnd. Afterwards we went to the local market. "
Museum with Jeju's culture and natural history,"C1 ( 2016.07.12 ) I think this museum was the best to know about Jeju in this area. The Jeju's culture and natural history was exhibited, and could see biology, fossil, and so on. If you visit in Jeju area, must visit this museum, because the trip was one of know about local history, I think."
Just good to know,"You could get info about Jeju here, I'm not a museum favorite people... but not much you can see there. Although the outside area is quite nice for taking selfies"
Simple introduction about Jeju island,"It's within walking distance if you were staying in Jeju city. It's a well organised, well maintain museum which give simple explanation about Jeju island, including its natural attraction, animals, life of Jeju folks in olden days etc. It also have a video room ( a short video showing what is special about Jeju). Worth a visit if you are totally new to Jeju, or a place to wandering around during raining days. Entrance fee only 1100w for adult. "
Simple Introduction to Jeju Island,Relatively simple museum for first time visitor to the island. We found the entrance was as interesting as the interior of the museum. The different halls gave a basic understanding of the cultural and historical background of the islanders. A 30-45 minutes visit will be sufficient to cover the museum.
Very crowded with tour groups,Some interesting exhibits but it is swarming with tour groups. Not very comfortable viewing unfortunately as you have tour guides and tourists shouting around you
Folk town,"If you play maple story, Korean folk town is a famous map haha!Okay, this place basically shows you the life of the people in jeju back in the earlier days. A good place to walk around, learn about the culture. Ambience is good,peaceful and calm."
Short and easy tour! ,The place is cosy and quite small for a museum. Good info on the history of Jeju but would love to see more exhibition. Finished the place in 30mins. Managed to have a taste of the Red Bean soup for the Winter Festival. 
History of Jeju in 30 minutes,The place offers great information on Jeju's history and displays of well-preserved artifacts too. The small park outside of the building have several sculptures and benches for one to rest and take photo. 
Good education on way of life,It was good to have our visit guided as it gave us a better understanding on how they live in those days. I like the story of the famous black pigs.
Not enough english descriptions,"English descriptions were insufficient, sometimes none existent. Yet still worth a short visit. Easy to find."
Jeju Island's Past,The museum was very well thought and laid out. Was really worth the visit as you can learn about how Jeju was formed and life before this island was modernized. Maybe before or after this museum visit you can head nearby for some good black pork ramen that i happened to just chance upon on the street opposite the main entrance. They have no english menu but the owner kinda understands if you just say black pork ramen. its a small restaurant with a yellow signboard and wooden storefront furnishings.
Worth Visiting,"If you want to get a quick snapshot of how life was lived in Korea a couple of centuries ago, this is a good pit stop. The museum is well thought-out and artifacts nicely displayed.Take a look if you're in the vicinity."
A village life filled with fun and happiness,"A simple village constructed from different sides and eras of the past. Some of which have been long forgotten but some are still within good condition. Many Korean dramas are played in this village which creates an interest in many fans. However, this village is quite big where it has also many games such as old past time games which keeps many occupied. The cactus candy obtained from here is authentic. Have to get some here to fill up your day. Overall, I believe that it was the best experience I have in Jeju island."
"Folklore & Natural History Museum, Jeju, South Korea","This was a shore excursion from our cruise ship. It was an educational tour, showcasing nature, folklore, marine, stonework exhibitions amongst other. 1 - 2 hours is more than suffice."
mad dash to exhibits,"my wife and i took the ""manager's recommendation"" tour of jeju island. we went to the museum which, as in most cases, was inundated with other tour groups and the local population. our guide's voice was often drowned out by louder guides making this experience unsatisfactory. the museum itself was interesting; but, we could have spent more time here were it not for the usual ""shopping"" experience mandatory on guided tours.we complained to the cruiseship's excursion desk requesting a 50% refund on our tour expense; however, since i did not have the bus number of our tour, our request was denied. so, the lesson here is remember your bus number in case you complain."
Educational,"The museum plays host to a lot of models depicting the life of Jeju natives in the early days. Very informative, if you like to learn about the history of Jeju and its people. If you're not a history/museum person though, you may want to give it a miss."
Educational tour of Jeju,"This was one of the stops for the Jeju City Bus Tours. Seniors like my mum got to go in free. It's a cosy museum that only takes 1-2 hours. Many Korean children come here for their school excursions, so it can get very noisy. Just opposite the museum is Jeju's famous noodle street."
We learnt a lot,"While on a tour of the island we spent some 90 minutes at the museum. To be honest I'm not a museum person, but found the layout, the models and well all of it very interesting and so informative.I've been to Korea on work 8 times, this was my first trip to Jeju, we really learnt so much about the people of Jeju, from the magical past regarding fishing, farming Etc.The clothes and the way of life.Very disabled friendly and very helpful staff."
wonderful,"Wonderful museum and all, talking about the heritage of Korea, I learned a lot of them and I liked the placeI enjoyed it very much"
Cultural Learning Experience,"My friends and I went to this museum and it was a good way to learn about the local culture of Jeju and Korea. It was interesting, but I wouldn't stay for more than 1 hour, but then again, I'm not a huge museum person."
Place to learn jeju cultures,"It's a museum with lots of rocks. It gets interesting when the exhibitions on jeju culture starts. Although i have to say, the museum in seoul is much better. You can take a nice pic at the entrance.."
Interesting,"If it's your first trip to jeju, this place is worth stopping in. It's interesting enough and give you a rundown of the formation of Jeju and it's culture along with some other nature stuff tossed in. It's popular with the tour buses, so if you're alone, prepare to be bombarded with waves of oblivious tour groups.admission is cheap and the outdoor part is nice and quiet with a few interesting statues. You don't miss anything by not going."
Really Interesting,"What an interesting place. I learned so much about Jeju Island just reading the signs. I literally read all the signs that accompanied the exhibits and learned about Jeju's climate, and ecosystems including marine life in and around Jeju.Great trip on a rainy day."
Interesting,The glimpse of life in Jeju was very interesting. Especially being told that they only got electricity on the island in the 1970's! Definitely worthwhile having a local tour guide to take you around the museum to give insights and explanations.
Interesting,"Interesting insight into how villagers in Jeju used to live. How everything was self- sustaining, growing their own vegetables, chilli, fruits, using existing rocks to build their fences, toilets, growing their own chickens, how small their rooms were... how little they had. Would be good to accompany this visit with a real live visit to Seoungeup Village. With all the distance travelling, there was little time to get all visits done as planned. Out of 9 must-sees I had planned. Only managed 5. It is good to drive but be disappointed by delays as highways are not like the US but slow like the UK, full of traffic lights and traffic cops/cameras. 60km/hr is the average speed. "
Life of Sea Woman,"Sea Woman is an old career in Jeju. Young girls start the job at their 12th and it lasts for their whole life. Dipping under the ocean to find fish, shells, abalones and anything that can feed their families, all they wear is thin clothes and no oxygen cylinder. They work nonstop all year round. The career is now dying as no young girls these days would sacrifice their beautiful youth in brutal sunlight and corrosive salt water. The museum has a collection of Sea Woman's tools and wax works. The display made us so sorry for these women. The locals see it as a precious heirloom of their culture. During our trip in Jeju, we actually saw some Sea Women working in the ocean. Of course, with oxygen cylinder and diving suit. The youngest living sea woman is now 50-some years old while the oldest is 90-some, who are claimed to be able to dip just as a young soul. Other interesting display showcases daily life, religious rituals, local houses, farming, fishing, hunting and lots of aspects of Jeju Island. Would have spent more time there...."
nice place to see the history of korea,not too crowded as I went during March. it was like 8 degrees Celsius.It was cold but I had a fun day.
Korean history unravelled,A great place to understand Korean history & culture. We had a local tour guide (Mr Kang) who was very well-read and knowledgeable in explaining the Korean history and culture. The flora and scenery was also captivating. 
Provides a good background to the island,"This fascinating museum has exhibits which show the geologic history of this volcanic island, natural history dioramas and folklife diofamas. It's a good introduction to the island."
Go !,"Another place to put on your list, well worth a visit.Lots to look at, and absorb, just get used to walking, it is worth it."
Go here First.!,"Id recommend to go here first when landing at jeju, so you can see what's the island is all about, where to see what and what to see and look for at jeju. There's history, geography and some geological things or two there. Short trip, an hour or two might cover the whole museum and with 1100 per entry its nothing compared to the knowledge you'd get from this visit about jeju."
Quite Informative,"This is a straightforward museum experienceYou see artifacts and a glimpse of life in Jeju Island and the Korean peninsulaFrom replicas of traditional houses, traditional clothing and celebrations, etcThis place has an abundance of all those thingsSo if you're into those historical facts, this is for youI'd say I was able to learn! Well-kept and good place it was"
Excellent Introduction,"This is a quick, short visit, but it is great for learning a lot about Korea and Jeju Island in particular. The other reviewers are absolutely right that it is a great introduction and so you should try to go here early in your visit to the island."
