An evening out...,Great neighborhood for an evening out and when you feel you’d like a drink and meeting a place where locals and foreigners mix at ease.Many bars to chose from and generally an easy going atmosphere. Worth a visit!
Cool Neighborhood,"Great area, lots of activity and great walking streets. Lots of food options. Safe and clean as is typical in Seoul."
i love the location! very convinient,many Muslims food. awesome! the subway are so closed to my hotel I stayed. Hamilton Hotel. The people are so friendly.
So nice street,"It's a a very nice please and its shops and restaurant with cafeYou can spend 5 , 6 hoursAnd you can buy to many thing"
Good Old ....Itaewon !?!?,"Perhaps it just me. Perhaps today was a Debbie downer in the area. Perhaps the day of the week wasn't right. Perhaps the coin showed Heads instead of tails. Or ... really... perhaps gentrification is starting to set in. It appears to be more of the last one. Went to Itaewon for the first time in 18mths today, and whilst its still a great place, I felt something was a little off about it. Refurbishment is starting to happen, there appear to be more empty shops, Bigger name franchises seem to be occupying more shop space, and with the move of USFK Headquarters to Pyongtaek, the foreign pedestrian traffic has significantly dropped. I understand that the Seoul Metropolitan government has goals for the area. Hopefully they have a positive impact on the area as Itaewon is a great place to go. I guess we will have to wait and see."
Hopping area of Seoul!,"Had never had a chance to visit Itaewon until recent visit to Seoul. Packed with shops, restaurants, pubs, and massage, this seems to be the energy center of Seoul. Fun place to walk around, enjoy a drink and watch people!"
3 night stay in Itaewon,"I have worked in South Korea for 10 years and visited Seoul and in particular Itaewon on a few occasions, for relaxing, shopping, food and nightlife. Each time has been a great experience across the board, however these past few days the experience was much less so.Hotel: Seoul was very busy last week due to events at the olympic stadium and also some sort of demonstrations so most hotels were heavily booked out, so booking as late as I did left little options in the Itaewon area.I chose the Hannam 67 Hotel which is about 1km walk from the Hamilton Hotel. Location was ok, but the hotel was extremely over priced and was pretty much a Korean style ""love hotel"" which are usually ok for a night or 2 but normally run from 60,000kwn to 80,000kwn. This hotel was charging 150,000kwn/night.Room was barely ok, very small, clean but very noisy in the mornings. Bath towels were many years old and had extra large holes in them. I would not stay there again unless no other options.Taxis around Itaewon and Lotte World & Myeongdong areas:Due to so many people in town the taxi drivers were for the most part extremely rude and tried to hold me to ransom on numerous occassions by refusing to use the meter and trying to charge 30,000kwn up front for a 6,000kwn fare! Yet if you walked to an area away from a taxi stand and where there were no people you got the taxi for the correct fare on the meter.Some very greedy taxi drivers around town these days!Business owners would refuse to assist me to try to call taxis even when I offered them my Korean ph to make the call for me.The local Kakao taxi call service was useless if the trip was too short for them to bother.All in all this experience was not what I had come across before. I certainly hope that this type of thing doesn't continue to get worse. Economy is down, businesses are closing and greedy people trying to rip of expats who local economy.I will not be going to to Itaewon, Lotte World or Myeongdong areas again.Disappointed to say the least."
Great place,"Lots to do, walk the streets and window shop. Then find a quaint place and cool off with a drink and some food. We walked up a small hill and found the Thirsty Monk. Reasonable prices, good service, food and drinks! Excellent view of street below!"
"A strip of bars, but a good standard of bars","I was quite impressed with this neighbourhood because it had all the makings of a seedy area, but it was lit as far as I could tell. Good bars, high end restaurants, safe atmosphere - yeah, well worth a pub crawl down here again! "
Muslim friendly,"Itaewon has many halal restaurants and foods... not far from itaewon subway station, you can see line cafe & store. Cute place and many photo spots in here. You should go!"
Suites from Benjamin since 2001,"I have bought shirts, suites, jackets, coats etc from Mercury Tailer since 2001. Can give highest recommendation. Geir Bjørkeli "
Live all day,"The area is almost always awake. In the morning you can go shopping and at night you can enjoy one of the many available bars, clubs, and restaurants in the area. It was interesting to see almost everyone communicating in English here."
Fun to be,"Itaewon is a great area fo meet a lot of foreigner in Seoul. You can party everywhere and eat food from around the world. But its not the ""Seoul"" you wanna visit for culture haha"
Eating place of Seoul ,This place offers a variety of places to eat from with different cuisines. The streets at night are vibey and with a lot more variety of ethnicity which I loved because my home town I see different kinds of people and after 1 week of seeing one kind of race it was REALLY so nice to see other kinds of ethnicities I’m used to seeing daily. Food was great here and with variety 
Energetic and alive night life area,"Bars and good music, I was there with a business friend to have a beer and we found this area great for young night life with bars and restaurant. If you want to feel Seoul young night life you must go there. Surly I’ll return."
Holiday ,"We visited this place at night. This area is for the young. Bars, clubs, restaurants,Karaoke and dance venues. The music is deafening and the crowds of young people in the back alleys are beyond belief. Not much different to other cities of the world to areas that attract young people. Go to observe if you are a bit long in the tooth or partake if you are young. "
Unremarkable.,"Itaewon does have lively nightlife going for it, but it's not really distinguishable from any other western downtown. The food is fine, and pricey and underwhelming compared other parts of Seoul. During the day, it's fairly slow and skippable. Go if you want to get wasted, wade through shifty people and party late, but don't expect cultural fulfillment or a unique experience."
Take the back alleys,The best restaurants and pubs are in the back alleys behind the Hamilton hotel. Our favorite was a seafood restaurant named Boiling Shrimp Crab on the third floor. Excellent cajun style seafood.
Fly for the Big Guy,"Itaewon has some great eats and would be the most popular place with foreigners. A massive US Military base is there so this is one of the only places to go in Korea for a big guy in search of clothes that fit. (T-Shirts, Tank Tops, Jeans etc.) There are a lot of bars and clubs and the seedier side of life is prevalent here. Not Somewhere for a first timer young lady foreigner on her own to go (unless you are into that). Some situations left my wife feeling a bit uncomfortable however we still had a great time here and did some good shopping."
Itaewon - Multi nationalism in Seoul,"Itaewon is known for serving cuisine that are not widely available in Korea, such as those from India, Pakistan, Turkey, Southeast Asia, Britain, Germany, Italy, France, Portugal, Spain and Mexico. It's known as ""Western Town,"" reminiscent of cowboy towns in Western nations."
Muslim Centre Of Seoul,They have a Mosque and muslim centre there. A lot of muslim and halal food. Its very convenient for those who choose to know about Korean Muslim culture.
I think it was better...,"...back in the day. That day would be when it was mostly a destination for American GIs. I guess Itaewon is now kind of an international area with lots overpriced foreign restaurants. Seems to have a large Middle Eastern presence. I walked around a bit reminiscing about the good ole days when I was a young GI back in 80s. Now, I don’t fit. I think young expatriates like it here, and there are some name brand stores that peaked my interest. "
International food galore!,It's an international food galore! Its a very hilly area to stroll but really worth the climb. Lots of halal restaurant too. Nice experience overall.
Mosque and halal food,"I went to Itaewon because many Malaysian travellers recommended this place for the mosque and halal food and because I wanted to try Plant Cafe. The mosque was great - it's located uphill and you can get a view of Seoul from there. However, Itaewon feels and look tacky. Definitely not the best part of Seoul. Not worth visiting again in future, except if I want to eat at Plant Cafe again."
"An area with less judgement, more international and the fun is a plus","This is the only area in Korea that the crow are less judgemental towards different race, sexual orientation, or religion. The area attracts all sort of different locals, tourists and expat crowd."
Strolling around,Was told this place has good bargains... yes I agree but mostly clothing. Timberland along the main road though is worth visiting for their sale items and maybe a few local restaurants.. you need a translator to enjoy because only a few speak English.
이태원으로,"There is one famous town named ‘Itaewon’ in the center of Seoul, the capital city of South Korea. This time, I want to recommend one Kebab restaurant in front of Itaewon station. The name of restaurant was ‘Ankara’. So I firstly thought that the capital city of Turkey is Ankara not Istanbul. Anyway the price of Kebab is a bit expensive but I don’t give anyting about the price. Just the taste of it. It tastes really good and It fitted to me. It is a bit spicy and a bit creamy and the lamb.이태원은 내가 가장 좋아하는 서울의 핫플레이스중 하나이다. 필자는 이태원에 가면 항상 들리는 곳이 있는데 그 곳중 하나는 바로 케밥을 파는 가게이다. 이태원 역을 나오면 역 앞에 있는 카페 바로 맞은 편에 자그맣게 차려져 있는 케밥가게를 볼 수가 있다. 가격은 대게 6000원에서 7000원 정도. 이정도 가격이면 내가 자주가는 순대국집에서 맛있는 순대국 한 그릇 정도 먹을 수 있는 가격이지만 그 정도는 개의치 않는다. 케밥을 먹을 수 있다면 말이지."
Good area for craft beer,"We visited Itaewon to drink Korean craft beer. We went to Booth and Magpie, both were great. An interesting part of the city."
put it on your visit list,"this street along with the area around it is almost international place in Seoul. plenty of small shops for clothes Korean souvenirs that you can buy ( insure to negotiate about the price). also a lot of restaurants are there especially Arabian, Turkish restaurants. also, I found 2 Arabian groceries for those whom want to buy Arabian meals or products. I would recommend to visit during day time until 8 PM. for families, avoid the area behind the Main Street at night since a lot of bar and adult places are there."
Still the international street,"This was the street beloved by US military personnel and their families. Now, most of them have moved to Pyeongtaek and this street is much less crowded. But, still many foreign residents visit here and there are various international shops and restaurants.It's good to visit and have fun at least once.- Most foreign restaurants are too expensive. 15,000 ~ 30,000 won per person normally. I recommend some affordable lunch menus.- Both of Korean and English are available in most places.- Since there's the only mosque in Seoul, it's easy to see Muslims or halal restaurants.- There are many young Korean foodies too.- Very crowded during Itaewon Global Festival in October.- Close to Gyeongnidangil Street(경리단길) or Haebangchon Village(해방촌) that are also popular areas.- There are some romantic rooftop pubs.- Also well-known for super size clothes or military merchandises."
Food Fest,I’m not sure if the food stalls is a staple here but it was an awesome atmosphere. Lots of people with great food. The aroma will surely make you hungry 
It’s ~~ okay,"So I am a Brit who lives in Korea and have been to Itaewon twice. As a place to go shopping it’s great, particularly if you’re a foreigner as they have many shops that cater to taller/larger people and have lots of souvenir shops. It’s so hard to find postcards in Korea but there are tonnes in Itaewon. Also you will almost always find Korean people that speak English here.If you have a couple of hours to kill it’s great. And if you’ve been in Korea long and you want to see lots of foreigners for a change go there.The down side is other than shopping, eating and drinking there’s not really that much to do so if you’re spending more than two hours there it can be a little boring. It’s great for finding foreign cuisines that otherwise you would struggle to find outside of Itaewon and great for the nightlife (if you’re into that).But it’s usually very crowded and when you have lived in Korea for a long time, it can be overwhelming.In general it’s great for shopping and souvenirs, and having a good night out."
Subhanallah,"I prayed at Friday Shalat October 5 yesterday. Even though rainy days, jamaah fill the mosque. Imam’s say about Al Ikhlas surah. It’s touching my heart. Subhanallah. Thank you for sympathy for the earthquake in Lombok and Palu, Indonesia"
Not what it was,Used to have great shopping from numerous small shops selling everything. Now some shops but nothing special. A fair amount of bars and restaurants with great selection of food and drink. We did not feel it was worth the effort to visit but did have a great lunch.
Best Cheese Pizza Ever,Popularly known as expat area. You can find variety of shops and restaurants serving cuisines from all around the world. Vibrant nightlife. Local Korean brands shopping. It was difficult to get a taxi back to hotel on Saturday night.For cheese pizza lovers i highly recommend to visit Pizza Revolution.
It's all about the partying!,I'm not into Itaewon a lot because it's mostly for people who love to party. This is where pub crawls usually happens and the like. One thing I like tho is that this place is near the War Museum of Korea. I should explore this place a lot more when I come back. ;)
"While it has plenty of bars opened at night, halal food are easy to find too","This area has more foreigners than other part of Seoul does. Many are selling halal food such us Middle Eastern, Indonesian, or Malay food, but there is also one or two restaurant selling halal Korean food (I recommend you going to Eid for halal bulgogi). There are also some halal stores selling halal food but don't expect them to be Korean brand - they are all imported so the price may be higher. Basically Itaewon is good for muslim who are living in Seoul but still needs to perform halal living while nonmuslim can spend night out at bars and restaurants. For tourism, the only thing I can recommend is halal Korean restaurant and the great mosque (even it's not really nice place to visit)"
city under the night sun,"i liked the sleepless nights there..24 hour walking street, so free of people all around the world. if you want a place that really want to feel at home and people friendly around,find it here"
A true mix of locals and internationals,"This is probably the only area in Korea that is truly international and also friendly towards all sorts of people. Locals and internationals, straight and LGBT people get along. The area has a variety of food nightlife scene. A must go on the weekends!"
Foreigner Central,"The locals call Itaewon ""foreigner central"". You can experience the whole world in this one area. Nightlife here is often considered the best in Korea, but also the most rough. "
VERY CLEAN!,I absolutely loved walking the streets here. They were so clean and everyone was so welcoming. We walked during the morning and the night time. The streets are lined with great establishments and eateries.
"A place to get western things, enjoy western dining","Good shops for getting what you miss from back home - wherever back home may be. Grocery stores, size appropriate clothing shops, restaurants, night clubs. "
Not much happening when we were there ,"First visited 2 years ago with friends and saw different parts in the evening. There are many interesting shops and once we had some beer at an independent brewery and another time we had ice cream in a Turkish cafe. This time when we returned at midday it seemed quiet and lifeless. I liked the greetings in different languages on the pavements but there wasn't much else to enjoy. Perhaps best visiting at night for a lively vibe but Hongdae, Insadong and Myeongdong might be more interesting."
International,"People of different nationality coming together, to live, to make a living or just visiting. More international restaurant here then Korean. Be prepared to walking along sloppy roads. Image in the day and night is huge."
Lots of bars and restaurants. Very lively area,"Party area of Seoul. Long road of bars and restaurants. Busy. Lively. Bright lights. A place for locals, tourists and off duty US soldiers to have some food and drink. Good place to go for some night life"
Good for clubbing and nightlife,"Itaewon is good for clubbing,nightlife and shopping. Foreign mart is there where you can buy grocery items which you will not find anywhere else. Also can do shopping roadside shops."
Worth visit!,"Itaewon is a great place to visit, especially for muslim family, as Mosque and halal restaurant is all around there. Recommended"
Not the best part of Seoul,"I have been dragged to Itaewon a couple of times and for me, it's not very interesting. It looks/feels tacky and it is quite an average part of Seoul, I don't understand the hype here. There are much better places in Seoul to eat and spend your money. Many people are saying it is foreigner friendly, but almost everywhere in Korea is foreigner friendly. The locals do whatever they can to accommodate you. I feel if you come to Korea, you should experience the real Korea and not somewhere that feels like the West/home. "
Lounge bar called Awesome,"This lounge bar might be changing names- its a big NO.Rip off for tourists- menu and all is in Korean so later on they charge you super high prices they want. They served us a bottle of Australian wine (which is usally an average wine) and charged us 149 US $! After we asked Korean people sitting next to us to translate the menu, we realized that the manager (who is standing in front of the bar) is lying about the prices. With complain from us, he lowered the price on 80 US $, which was still not realistic and too high."
Various culture are mixed on this place,"Muslim temples and US military units are in close proximity, and there are a variety of restaurants and tourists from all over the world as well as Muslims and US troops.Embassies of various countries are gathered and are expected to provide convenience to tourists.Access to the city, such as Namsan and Namdaemun Insadong, is also good.Foreign tourists are a place to visit by all means."
Excellent Night Out,"Most of the people have already shared the location, ie behind the hotel- Its easily found out once you reach there.Various watering holes available on various price points. some would try and restrict to create artificial scarcity, some would welcome. my suggestion try and visit all before settling down on one, rather on first one you see. Totally ignore the ones restricting entry - just fluff - move on to next"
Good ,The area is good for food and drink and night life everything is open for late .. too many restaurants and different cuisines.. Hala food and fast food .. and it have tooo many night clubs 
What a great time,I have visited Itaewon numerous times with my family. It is a family friendly area as long as your stay close to the main road. I recommend to any and all expats to come to Itaewon. 
Place to go out,"Basically a place to hang out at night, lot of bars, clubs, and restaurant.Bunch of people from everywhere.A bit dirty at night but you know, that’s a place for “partying” or to come and visit before 23.But it’s safe and nobody is rude.Definitely can feel the Seoul crazy vibes"
Lots of halal restaurants,"For Muslims, halal food is necessary. So, Ittaewon is a good place to find halal food, and the price was affordable. There is a mosque where you can take your time to perform your prayers."
A mini UN area.,Itaewon is truly a mesh and mixture of people from everywhere. The streets are alive with cadences of world languages and smells fill the air from restaurants serving foods from all over the world. The weekends are wall to wall bar hoppers and party people. A must see when in Seoul.
Moslem Area,"there is a huge mosque in itaewon or people called it Seoul Central Mosque... this area is filled with Moslem people from around the world, so you can easily find halal food here.. there is also a store that sell stuff or food ingredients from all over the world, it's very convenient"
Good for muslim,Easy to get muslim guesthouse and near from mosque also have many delicious halal food restaurant in the town .
Foodie paradise,So very many restaurant hidden in the backroads and alleys. Plus on the street kiosks to buy souvenirs
OFWs’,I must say this place is where you can see a lot of coloured people of different race. A place where you can see the Korean Memorial War Park and home of the famous Hamilton Hotel.
Halal food galore,"If you're a muslim and particular of food served being halal, then Itaewon is the place to stay or go in seoul.Varieties of halal food restaurant could be found."
Free and easy,"Very Cosmopolitian. Friendly people everywhere, food was so good, all things you can find here, Bathhouse was special, nightlife is a must . Overall a Ist visit place."
Great Place To Find Halal Food,"We went here simply because we went to get our lunch as we were told that there were lots of halal diners. True indeed, you can easily spot halal kebabs everywhere from The Sultan Kebabs up to any other small shops selling the same thing. We did have our lunch in one of the kebabs diner. Excellent kebabs, delicious & affordable. We also got to see lots of Malaysians there, maybe because there was a nearby mosque there. Nothing much to see other than that. It is also a walking distance to Leeum Samsung Museum of Art."
Did I miss the fun part?,"Not much to do here. Don't go out of your way to come here if you're in Seoul for a week. Lots of bootleg brand names at not very cheap prices. The restaurants around here come in all-sorts of cuisines - albeit culturally mish-mashed and maybe trying a bit too hard without actually getting there. The NZ themed pub served fush n chups and green lipped mussels, but had only one kiwi beer on offer (which they didn't have) alongside Asahi and Hoegarden. If you're in the area and want a chill place for an afternoon drink, recommend the Bungalow pub which has kitschy swing seats and a sand area where you can take off your shoes but apart from that, I didn't find Itaewon very eventful."
English Speaking Shop Owners + Interesting Shopping/ Restaurants,"Itaewon is close to former/ existing US army Headquarter. Most shop owners/ keepers command good English for this reason. Itaewon has variety of restaurants + interesting shopping areas, socks, shoes, cloths, leather garments, goods, souvenier, hats, caps, scarves, jewellery, watches etc."
Only place in Seoul with international flavor,"If you are looking for international restaurants, bars and nightlife then Iteawon is the place you want to be. There are plenty of different ethnic restaurants around this area then any part of Seoul. A happening bar/lounge place is called ""Prost"". Good place to eat is called ""Tapas bar"" Short distances walk from each other."
Easy to find halal food,"Not exactly my favorite place, I found it to be a little more on the dirty side compared to other places in Seoul. This is where Seoul Central Masjid is located also this neighborhood is famous for having numbers of halal restaurant, a must visit for Muslims."
Skip this place if shopping is your main interest or if you don't have time...........,"This place is full of bars, local & international cafes & restaurants.Every corner you turn, rows & rows of such F&B outlets catches your attention. In fact, there are more F& B than products shops. Noticeably there are also more Westerners ( saw quite a number of military men) here than in other places.If you are the type that likes to mainly shop (& dine local cuisines) in places like Myeongdong, Hongdae, Dongdaemun, Namdaemun & similar- then skip this place.Don't waste your time here. Or unless you have time to kill & have no where else to go. Like us , on the last day in Seoul.We skipped Itaewon in previous visit few years back.You can see from the many pictures that there are not many tourists here as compared to the other mentioned places.An interesting thing about Itaewon station is that it is the only one we have been to so far, that has both a Tourist Information office & a station information counter. Most stations don't even have a station information counter."
Nightlife,"Go here for the nightlife. Lots of restaurants and bars so expect loud music, cigarettes, booze, etc. Lots of shops too."
Foreigner friendly neighborhood,"Great for shopping, exploring, and eating during the day. Also good eating and drinking at night. Whether you are searching for souvenirs or a craft beer you can find it in Itaewon. No need for a paid tour-- just wander around and enjoy the sights and smells."
Great Seoul nightlife at reasonable prices........,"I've been coming to Seoul for well over ten years and can remember Itaewon as a rather sleazy area, frequented mainly by GI's given it's proximity to the US Army base at that time. Since the Americans moved out of the city, the area has seen massive development and now hosts a wide choice of bars and restaurants in the area around the Hamilton Hotel on Itaewon itself, and the pedestrian road behind. Most bars are reasonably priced, offering a more affordable option outside of the main tourist hotels. It is the place in Seoul to spend an evening - well worth a visit !"
Wine and dine,International area for dining and wining. Plenty of bars and restaurants - mid and high end. Lots of small shops as well to do some shopping especially on day time. Most known at night as party place. One visit is not enough to enjoy the area. Explore the vicinity and try those bars and restaurants so al types and profiles. Access trough itaewon station. 
Lovely neighbourhood,We spent few hours around the neighbourhood and bought few things that we were aiming for. The area is really nice with a lot of nice and full of character cafe / restaurant. There is a LINE friend shop which the children are really enjoying doing some shopping.
Best night life area in Seoul,"This is the best place to go out and party in Seoul. I really love this hood, it has a great atmosphere and you can find any type of bar in here. This is also the area where all foreigners go for drinks. You can drink on the street. I would suggest to hit B1 Club, Bliss, thursday party and U bar."
not Recommended,"It is one of Famous district in Seoul with many International restaurants ,Cafes,bars and Shops.This area is slightly nice .However, it is not safe at night because it will be full with hookers .Also,this place have some Halal restaurants and Islamic Culture. I didn't like this place because most of people so mean and and they take advantage of tourist,Bad sewer smell and it is crowded."
"Recommended below 40 year old, maybe less ...","To enjoy this place you need energy, and some money . I would have liked much more at the time I went to Rimini, or Fengirola and Torre Molinos ( I was 20 and 24 ... ). Very young population around and the style is ... drink, have fun, shop something just to fill up the time, ... drink, eat, have fun ."
Tackiest part of Seoul,"Imagine a place with the most obnoxious and loud tourists (and some other, equally unpleasant 'locals') , tacky aesthetics, ridiculously overpriced restaurants and you get Itaewon. Even the air manages to be smellier and more polluted than in other parts of Seoul. If you're visiting Seoul or Korea and want to see the impressive and beautiful parts of it, avoid it at all cost."
Our Summer 2016,"It was after 4 yrs we went to Seoul since December 2012. My husband, myself and our 4 yrs 7 mths old daughter stayed in myeongdong area for a week where it can easily go by exit 4. It was a walking distance to namdaemun and not far by taxi to itaewon and dongdaemun. We having breakfast at the Korean muslim restaurant EID and during that time there was 2 menu available (meat and chicken) "
Foreigner town,"You know when your here as you will be surrounded by cafes and foreign restaurants. Incredibly boring during the day though you can get a good lunch at many different places, the evening is when this place livens up.If you want to experience Korea or actually have a meaningful holiday I would advise you to avoid this place.If you are in Korea to party and hangout with other foreigners or perhaps you are an expat who wants to be somewhere a little more diverse, then come here."
Many shops and bars,"Itawon is a touristy or expat area in Seoul but is still worth a visit. There are many souvenir and craft shops. In the back alleys there are many bars frequented by tourists, expats and locals alike. There are also a number of clubs for later in the evening if that's your thing. The vibe in Itawon is exciting which adds it to the list of must visits when in Seoul. "
Not only bars and clubs,"This is the place where you can find a different type of local, it's expatiate area. There are plenty of bars, clubs and restaurants for any taste and any cuisine. And I guess this is the beloved place for all Korean expats.Apart from that it's a very beautiful area with lots of tiny street, hills and great views."
"Ok, if you must","I have been here many times in the past myself to pick up cheap knock-offs...but with so many places to shop these days, there is no particular reason to go to Itaewon. The one exception is that this is a unique place. The foreigners here will outnumber Koreans. There are some good ethnic restaurants. Ok...I guess if you must, you can visit this unique place to see where you used to go for all things foreign. With so many GIs in the neighboring base, you can find your share of seedy bars...at least you used to in the hilly surroundings."
Just an area where all the expats gathered....,"Lots of different international shops and restaurants , night clubs/bars in the area ...If you are looking for some happy hours drinking and stuff probably are good place to hang out in the evening hours and night time. During the day just another shopping street...But I enjoyed The Line Friends Cafe.lol"
Tourists place every tourist should come,"For me, I'd come here mainly for food. There're shops everywhere just like anywhere else, but restaurants here have more variety. They seems to be more English friendly than restaurants in other parts of the city."
Nice area but...,"I understand this is a tourist/expat area but it is also very much known as an international area in terms of culture and food. That is often a great combination in my experience. Unfortunately, in Itaewon many(not all of course) of the expats seem to really dumb down the area with a lot of ugly, disrespectful, obnoxious behavior(no need to say where they are from). I'm all for expats blowing off some steam because I have been one, but I was surprised how rude so many expats were in this area while in the pubs, restaurants and even on the streets. It's just my experience and opinion but that was disappointing especially since I expected I would love this area. On the positive side, if one is able to avoid the neanderthals mentioned above, there really is a ton of great little spots for dinner and drink. Whatever you are craving for food you will find it, from all over the world. There is a lot of trendy little places as well as a few local food joints if you look. There is also the subway station so it's easy to get to and from. As a tourist, I would not stay in this area again. It's just simply not Korea. I would stay in a different area of Seoul and just visit Itaewon for an evening. As an expat, this is possibly a good area if craving some western interaction but its not a typical expat area."
Seoul Itaewon (Itaewon main and direct side roads),"Itaewon main road including direct side roads has many shops and offers food from all over the world. Bars, Lounges, Clubs and Pubs are available to get you a nice evening. The area is always busy and crowded. Especially on the weekends. Itaewon main road is not Korea from the security point of view. Don't leave your valuables unattended. Be prepared that about hundred nations are visiting the place at the same time. And early morning drunken bodies hanging around. Anyway you either like the place or not. It is a nice place to be out for some drinks but if you want to move nearby you should check it out before."
Touristy ,A nice spot for tourists to see a variety of Korean culture. Many vendors speak English. Lots to eat with reasonable prices.
Relaxed atmosphere,"If you want to enjoy summer breeze, a nice walk in a relaxed atmosphere and try food from around the world, this is the place to go."
Tourists as far as the eye can see,"Itaewon is sometimes known as the city where there are more tourists and foreigners than actual Koreans, and I think it's because this place had a military base in the past (Not sure if it's still around now!). If you want to experience the night life in Seoul, this is probably the best place to be. From K-beauty brands to foreign goods (like Nike and Adidas), this place has got it all. There are also plenty of drinking places, pubs, and hole-in-the-wall restaurants that cater to every foreigner's tastes. I saw a Halal Guys, a Turkish delight dessert cafe, and steakhouses to name a few. While it offers nothing new in terms of overall experience, Itaewon has a lot of character and it's a great place to put on your itinerary, if your trip can afford it :) "
One day visit to Itaewon,It was a casual visit to this place and was very exciting and memorable visit. Main street was fully crowded with people from different countries and culture. A different experience.
Good place for shopping,Good tourist street full of tourists and shops. You can find many things and also international food here
Halal Korean Food,"A place to get delicious Halal certified Korean Food. Visit the Mosque. To get to all those location, you have to hike a little bit."
Great ex-pat friendly neighbourhood,"This is a great neighbourhood to go explore for food and drink. The main street is abuzz with pubs and restaurants but we particularly liked the side streets and back lanes where it was quiet and filled with hidden cafes and intimate diners. The residential areas are also really nice to walk through. The closest subway station is conveniently close by, Itaewon Station."
Food heaven,"Although there are Korean restaurants in Itaewon, most people go to Itaewon for food other than Korean. And there is everything from Bulgarian, Chinese, Japanese, South African, French, Italian, Spanish, Indian, Turkish and a lot more. My favorite vegan restaurant Plant is also located in Itaewon. Aside from the food, there are lots of shops, cafes and hotels. Worth a visit - it will be satisfying."
Muslim Friendly ,"We stayed at apartment that we booked via Airbnb in Itaewon.. the surrounding is very clean and safe even on the weekend there is so many people gathering and drunk around the pub area... i never been feel so secure to walk around drunken group of people... beside we can easily find muslim friendly restaurant and street food... even some of the teksi drive dont know where is the mosques but u can reach by walk if u dare to climb the 'deadly' itaewon spa stairs... deadly mean the stair is very steep and hight... overall.. we love to stay at itaewon again for our 2nd trip.. in running man, they said.. itaewon land of freedom.. which mean.. people don't bother what u do.. just mind our own business in a good term, but it doesn't mean they are selfish and anti social... "
"Great variety of restaurants from around the world, interesting shops & street art","Itaewon is a fun neighborhood of Seoul with a relaxed, youthful vibe. There is an endless supply of fabulous restaurants representing any type of cuisine you could want from around the world! There are also lots of interesting shops, many that you don't see elsewhere in Korea. My husband and I enjoy just strolling around looking for street art and murals in this neighborhood. There is a lot to see and do here!"
A must visit place,"first time visiting this part of town, and I was happy I did. It was a quite different atmosphere here than all the places in Seoul that I visited. And it was a good change of pace.. more relax and not rushed. All the signs were written in English so that was good and the side street cafes and restaurants I thought were very nice. It reminded of a small town in east coast USA. We strolled on the main drag, and all the side alley in between... the shops, restaurant and cafes. It was like an international market in one place; an array of restaurants like Thai, Vietnamese, French, Italian, Middle Eastern, Japanese, Chinese, Philippines, American Diner to name a few. You'll most likely run into more foreign nationals than Koreans here. I don't remember the name of the shopping place but make sure to check out the indoor shopping mall to save some money on your souvenirs, and other goodies. "
I didn't like it,The people were so bad and they take advantage of tourist. Every thing is expensive more than any other place 
3 stars for Main Street but 4 stars for...,"As most people reviewed, this Main Street is mainly restaurants, bars and pubs, with the the tourist souvenirs shops. If you prefer the busy and packed atmosphere, stay in the Main area. There is nothing that differentiate this area from any others then. But if you like a serene dinner with your loved one, explore the small lanes BEHIND the Main Street. Walk up the slopes heading into the residential area just behind. It is a completed different feel from the main touristy area!! You will find many small cafes and diners scattered in the quiet residential area. This was a truly unexpected discovery for us."
"If you are in Seoul, you must visit this place","ITAEWON is a small place at Seoul which is known for shopping for korean souveniors. This is aplace where you will get all kind of shops, restaurants, pubs etc"
"great area for food, bars, pubs","Itaewon is a great area for shopping, food, pubs, bars, nightlife. Custom tailors, luggage, luggage tags, lots of shopping. Pubs, bars, restaurants of all types. From an English pub to Spanish tapas, you can find it all. A great area, I recommend to anyone in the Seoul area!"
Shopping Stop for Souvenirs,"Beautiful place to shop, almost as though it is a museum to me. Easy access from subway stations. Souvenir goods are a bit pricey by 1000 to 2000 KRW if compared to those you can get in Myeongdong area, but in terms of variety and aesthetic preference, Itaewon shopping area is a lot better. Also safe for female solo travelers - I went there alone. Lots of families and couples are around to shop. BTW I came here simply because of an episode of Running Man (a popular variety show in South Korea), and I tell you, the place is a lot more beautiful compared to what I saw on the show. Will return here, definitely."
Hmmm...,"Well, not quite sure what title to put my review. You will either like or don't like it. Being born and grown up in a country that is pretty international, I don't quite like Itaewon. To me, it's just like an international town. You can probably find all kinds of cuisine here. However, I must say that some of their shopping lanes are good. I came across this shop that does embroidery and is patronize by a lot of tourists to get their luggage tag, caps and even clothes embroidered. This shop was featured on the tv before as well. "
Average compared to the rest of Seoul,"I was expecting a better vibe from the Itaewon area, but I was sorely disappointed. I had heard that it was a fun, eclectic, international area, but I found it to be overly rowdy and much less interesting than other districts. As an American, I was embarrassed by the loud (even shouting!) U.S. tourists on the long side streets and unimpressed by the restaurant offerings. It seemed to attract people who wanted the experience of Seoul, but didn't want to actually go out and explore the city. Lots of tacky older couples and older teenagers. Save your time and go somewhere more fun (eg. anywhere else in the city)."
International area,"Come to this area if you want a bit of of an international experience. What you will notice almost immediately is that there is a lot more English around. On shops, on menus, on signs and spoken as you walk the streets. You can find many different restaurants (Indian, Malaysian, Canadian, Tai, etc) that I have not seen in other areas. Sadly we noticed that Graffiti was also a lot more evident. If you have been travelling a while then sometimes the home coforts that can be found here are a nice indulgence, even if the prices are up to the higher end."
Exotic quarter in Seoul,"Exotic quarter in Seoul where you can find Halal food and other international food, mostly western style."
Eclectic place,This area is nice to mosey about. There are many other cultures here to experience. I just enjoyed walking about without much of an aim so that I could just take in the area.
International place in seoul,"Ive been there for lunch and prayed in the masjid. The street is very diffrent from other city, cause is little bit messy and not clean there are leftover in every corner od the street... But there are many halal restaurant good for moslem"
Nice area,Probably the only 'multi-cultural and diverse' place in Seoul. Many restaurants and pubs/bars serving international cuisines and drinks. Good area to have a walk around and explore the souvenir shops.
Best custom tailored suit place in Itaewon,"The DYNASTY tailor was highly recommended by friends for decent price of quality suit in Itaewon. because my body shape is not like a normal built which is a very broad shoulder with thick arms so none of rack suit fits me at all. that's why I definitely need a custom fitted suit so I went this tailor ordered 3 suits and 5 shirts. The suits and shirts turned out so fabulous!! They fits me like a glove and quality was fantastic! and they solved long term of my chronic trouble of attire at once.And I would purchase more suits from this tailor by online because they keep my very accurate pattern on file. lastly I would like to say, It is quite true as I have heard that."
Great area! ,"Loved this crazy area of seoul. Lots of shops and restaurants in crazy shapes, a must! One part is mostly fashion stores and then there is a dedicated foodstreet as well!"
a good place to find halal food in seoul!,"Itaewon Market looks like a junk yard sale. A good place to find antique stuff. If you are hungry, there are a lot of Halal restaurants especially near the mosque. To go here, take a subway to Itaewon Station (Line 6)"
Hip and happening,"On weekends its totally crowded and difficult to get a seat in the popular pubs. Not far from Gangnam district, little difficult to get transport late at night."
Mad Party Place,"If you want to witness some mad parties and Seoul's night life- head straight to Itaewon. Once a US Military base, is now a very popular hangout for young boys and girls. South Koreans really know how to party. Itaewon has the best clubs, amazing pubs and good eateries. The place is up and bouncing until early mornings. "
Hipster and halal central,"Visited Itaewon in 2005 and revisited in Nov 2016. The place is full of hipster galleries and craft shops and lotsa halal outlets, making it a magnet for Muslim travellers. Excellent."
Hallal Heaven ,"Many Hallal Restaurants in the area, that is why I call it Hallal Heaven especially for muslim travellers. Not only does it cater for muslim travellers but the area also has streets of shopping too. Very hilly area but great place to find souvenir to bring back to home country. There are tourist stores that sell clothes attire like shirts, caps and shorts including socks. There are even posters and korea music CD to buy. Apart from that, there are also sport shops like Adidas or PUMA basketball shop and custom jersey stores at the area and many other shopping stores in the area. For transport, there is bus stop and the area also has subway too."
Nice plcae,Nice area to hangout specially if you are foreigner from M.E you can find halal food In the morning its nice and quite in compare with the nights I mean . Lots of drunk ppl 
International Sector,"Itaewon is an area in which the American base and many embassies and consulates are located. As such, it has shops and restaurants focused on catering to both Korean and non-Korean nationals. The bar district/nightlife is probably the best in Seoul."
An 'international' area,"A Muslim-friendly area, Itaewon is known to have halal restaurants and shops. If you find any korean products that sell here, that's mean Muslim can buy it if they are sold outside. The well-known mosque is also located here but it only opens during the day but the compound is opened to the public all day. Mind you that this area is filled with pubs too, so take care of yourselves. "
Must visit place in Seoul,The international feel was strong. There were lots of restaurants selling different cuisines from different countries. A good mixture of local and international shops. A great way to experience diversity. Street views were impressive.
Eash to find halal food,"This is the place where i can easily found so many halal restaurant. You can choose either local korean dish, kebab, arab /pakistan menu. The only mosque in seoul was located here."
Itaewon,Been here lot of times. Arguably the best selection of restaurants. One of the best places to hang out during the day. Lots of foreigners
A must visit area when in Seoul,"Getting to Itaewon Station would be on Line 6 of the Seoul Subway.This place is probably one of the coolest area to visit in Seoul. I had the international feel here, with alot of restaurants serving international cuisines, many shopping areas with international brands, and an area where students (University or college kids can be seen. We went to this area both in the daytime, for lunch, and came back on a nightime. There is a lot of cool bars around. We witnessed a halloween parade here. It was really cool, there was a show on the streets and people were in costumes in celebration of the halloween. It was a pleasant dining experience in this area as there were a lot to choose from. The international feel or ambiance of this area added to its charm. This area is lovely, fun, and where many events seem to be happening."
Lots of happenings and very much alive at night.,"This an area packed with locals and tourists alike. Lots of restaurants, bars, cafes and eateries. A good place to soak up the atmosphere or just sit around and do people watching. Some street musicians are there too to entertain the crowd. Shops abound too but the price may be high. But I saw many shops are having promotion and sales."
Not What It Use To Be,"If you were a U.S. Military member and remember all the great times you had in Itaewon in the 60's, 70's, 80's and 90's, well you are in for a shock. Not a place to hang out or spend the night in. Half of those hole in the wall clubs are off limits by USFK and many of the others are run down and closed. The King Club, UN Club, Grand Ole Opera and East/West clubs are still there, but really are not what you were use to.I would not go there unless you were in a group (especially women that are alone). And don't flash any cash or high value jewelry.There are several new eating establishments within the area behind the Hamilton Hotel. All are ethnic based and served with a little Korean flair. Korea is still a great place to visit and play in, but times have changed and Itaewon is ""Not What It Use To Be"".DDS"
Super cool area,"Itaewon is definitely worth a visit. I only went there at nighttime and the vibe in the area was super cool and international. There are restaurants from all over the world, from Egypt to America and to Korea obviously. Besides from that there is a lot of cool bars and clubs (go to either Gold Bar or Thursday Party - cool vibe and cheap drinks!)"
Great place at night,"This place is ""the"" area to go at night as its packed with restaurants, bars, and clubs. Lots of (mostly young) Koreans and some tourists as well. If you like to club and drink this IS your spot."
Many international restaurants ,If you wanna try different kind of international foods... If you wanna have Halal restaurants... If you wanna pray in a Masjid... If you wanna see different people from different cultures... Itaewon is the best area in Seoul...
Great place for foreign food and drink,Good place to spend a night or weekend. Plenty of variety for international food and lots of bars and clubs to drink in. Cheap accommodation to be found also. 
busy street with lots of culture around,"this area has the only mosque in seoul, muslims are encourage to visit and experience the muslim community in Seoul here. this area also caters alot of Halal food, south east asian food. etc.nevertheless, at night this area change completely into an opposite culture. got alot pubs and clubs around."
New touristic district ,"As i informed here is new touristic part of seoul witch many foreigners comes, with many international restaurant,brands and bars. "
not so good,A place with some cafe and bar. if u muslim go to this place because there is a mosque and halal food in this area
Muslim Food,Very nice town especially those who are looking for muslim food. There is also a supermarket that sells all halal food items.
Has changed a lot in 20 years,I was stationed here 20 years ago and man has it changed. Some for the bad but alot for the GOOD. great place for foreigners if its your first time to Seoul. It will let you ease into the Korean culture. But don't stay here there is so much more to do in Seoul!!!
great foreigner area,one of the few books store that sell English books in Seoul.also one of the few areas to get American sized clothes
Itaewon,"My partner and I LOVE visiting Itaewon in the evenings. The night life is a blast, especially for a gay couple. Gay Hill is fin and loaded with gay bars. Hoe Hill is also always poppin and alive. If this isn't your scene, there are HUNDREDS of other very modern, fun bars all in walking distance of one another. 11pm to 5am has never gone by quicker!"
"Food, Fun, and Shopping","I very much enjoyed my frequent visits to Itaewon while working nearby. I learned to love the local food, but was grateful for the Western alternatives too. Shopping for gifts to send home was fun and reasonably priced. I also purchased tailor-made suits, uniforms, and specialty jackets here. Great craftsmanship. "
Bustling Shopping and Restaurant Area,"There is a large US military base in this neighborhood - I believe it has been there since the Korean War. The base probably has influenced the types of shops and restaurants here. The shops are not high-end, but very diverse. The restaurants are crazy-diverse too. There is a lot going on here, day or night. I would recommend getting there by subway (line 6)."
good variety of restaurants,It was walking distance from where I stayed (Grand Hyatt) and so walked there one evening for a meal. There were a lot of different types of restaurants. 
Had everything we needed.,Stayed in Itaewon for a week and we had everything one could possible need in a 5 mile radius. Plenty of places to eat and 2 grocery stores. It was clean and safe. Super interesting on Halloween night. 
Itaewon is for International cuisine,"We were craving western foods and if you are looking for International cuisine then Itaewon will have what you want. We came across a pizza place right next door to On the Border. We ordered a pepperoni pizza and it was as good as NY style pizza!! On the Border was highly recommended but we weren't in the mood for Mexican food. As we walked along the main street, you can find all sorts of International restaurants from Italian, to Greek, to Canadian, to Mexican, to French or American and there was even a Lady M bakery and an Outbacks steakhouse!! We took the subway and got off at the Itaewon station and when you come to to the street level the choices are endless. "
Very nice stop,We came to the area to find a restaurant for dinner and man oh man- loads of options here. There's also a bunch of shops. It's within walking distance to yongsan base so we did not bother with a car. Can't wait to go back and explore some more!
Suitable for all Muslims,"The Itaewon district is the most popular place among Muslims particularly as there are lots of Halal eateries there as well as Muslims grocery shops. It's clean and there's also a mosque there even though we have to climb up the road to get to the mosque. Overall, Itaewon is the nicest place to stay in Seoul."
Buzzing with tourists and off duty US military ,"Visited Itaewon on a Saturday night so it was obviously busy, plenty of atmosphere and very busy. Had a good dinner and then checked out various streets, great bars and clubs that we didn't visit with my 17 year old daughter. "
"Good for friends, couples or families ","I've been to Itaewon several times over the last 10 months and everytime I go back, I always find something new or something I overlooked the previous trip. Very touristy but friendly ."
Shops and restaurants,"The Itaewon district offers a wide selection of various shops, street vendors, restaurants and pubs / bars.When visiting Seoul my fiancée and I spent about an hour or so in the area, before visiting one of the many (good) restaurants located here.It is okay for a quick visit or just to have been there, but in my opinion now that this one's been ticked off the list I would most likely not go back.The area is not bad in any way - it's just so many other nice areas to experience in Seoul.Note that many of the shops close between 8 pm and 9 pm."
"A lot of famous restaurants, mostly reasonably priced","This place has a lot of famous restaurants, especially foreign food ones. Some food are expensive, but mostly are reasonably priced. You can buy clothes (big size clothes are famous) and snickers also. I think the only demerit is it is hard to find parking lots on weekends."
the foreigner district in seoul. ,"here all foreigner restaurants, stores and embassies gather. you can find almost any international food in here. also its famous for its clubs and bars at night but be careful, you can not take taxi after 12 midnight when the metro close because the taxi drivers only take people who go far so they can get the most money of them or they will not use the counter and negotiatie high unfair price with you"
Nothing to see,"Had high hopes of the western influenced shopping and food but left disappointed. There were not many shops with recognised international brands, and the neighourhood seemed a bit seedy. We left after walking down the streets for 5 mins. Your time will be better spent in Myeongdong, Ewha or Hongdae. "
Highly recommended place,"As you can see the rank of the Korean restaurants, most of the restaurants which are highly ranked are in Itaewon. I'd say this is the place where you can experience some kind of diversity in Seoul. There are a lot of foreigners here. It's actually pretty cool in terms of foods, clubs and bars, sort of things이태원은 정말 흥미로운 곳인 것 같습니다. 식당과 바들이 특색있어서 체인점이 우글거리는 신촌이나 건대보다 한국인에게나 외국인에게나 더 재밌는 것 같아요"
International flaire,A fun area to be strolling around. Found small hole-in-the-wall coffee shop in the back alleys. Streets are lined with restaurants from different countries. Interesting public art in front of buildings. Would come again for art galleries and museum.
Itaewon is great neighborhood for international visitors,Itaewon is one of our favorites to go eat as it has a wide variety of choices of all international flavors. colorful and vibrant area.
shopping,"A street shopping mall, place you could find shoes and various attire at reasonable price. Nice to people watch over here."
Tailor Made Suits!,"Shopped here for a day. Lots of tailors on the street. The boys all got a suit made. The suits are beautiful and so well made. They have enjoyed getting to wear them back here at home and show off their name sew inside!!!! Loved the shopping here. Bought a hand painted trivet from Turkey. Never know what you are gonna find! This area had lots of brand name stores such as: Nike, Sketchers, Crocs....."
Travelling with muslim friends,"It's kinda hard to find a halal food in Korea. So we heard from a friend that had been here, there's a shop in Itaewon which served Halal Korean dishes (I mean why come to Korea if you don't try the local cuisine), we got lost of course, but there's plenty of halal shop all around. There's abundant to choose from. The mosque is also here.Nearest st: Itaewon station exit 2"
"Food-yes, Gaybars-yes, clubs-NO","I love Itaewon for it's great cuisine, my favorite gay bar BUT hate it for it's dirty clubs! Why not clubs? Too many American soldiers, African immigrants and others who come their for an easy prey! There is a notion that in that area people can behave themselves in a worst way. Men come there to hook up with some drunk ladies and do not even have much respect to those who aren't interested in them. In terms of clubs, I would prefer Hongdae over Itaewon, to feel much safer."
souvenir shopping,"This part of Seoul has a little something for everyone. Located near the US army base, it has shops, food, and stores that can customer make almost anything for you. You want to avoid some sections due to the adult entertainment that is offered but during the day it is a nice stop with lots of choices."
Antique Stores Galore,This is a great area to walk around in if you like antiques. There are lots of little antique stores throughout the area. The are other littel galleries and stores also but definitely the focus is antiquities.Must go if you love the old stuff.
Foreigner friendly & lots of FOOD,"Itaewon is very accepting for foreigners. Not only does it have the highest concentration of foreign (non-Korean) peoples, it has a lot of food and almost everything speaks some sort of English here. So if you feel like you do not understand anyone in other parts of Seoul, come here and order food!"
Rocking Place for Party Lovers,Its hang out place mainly for Young crowd where you can party late nite on weekends. There are many night clubs playing good music. This place also has good Indian and Pakistani restaurant. You can also do shopping in this area.For Indian people you can get Indian grocery in this area
A vibrant multicultural street in Seoul,A vibrant multicultural street in Seoul with many international an middle eastern restaurants. A must see street after long day of your trip to Seoul.
World famous shopping,"The variety of shops and range of goods is mind boggling ! Within three days of the first fitting of bespoke suits / tailoring, we were back to get the final fitting for trouser length etc. Outstanding values and a unique way to experience the market driven economy of Korea. Women's fashions a la Vogue available for customs tailoring too."
Special area in Seoul with other ethnic groups,"Itawon is a mix culture area with different ethnic groups, there is a mosque for Muslims and churces for Christians. There is a US Army facilities in Itaewon; you can hear people speak English in Itaewon. Interesting place in Seoul."
Foreigner paradise ,"This place is always crowded with foreigners (as well as locals) and it has a lot of different types of food. The food range from korean food to italian food and many more. There are a lot of shops nearby selling things like accessories, handmade stuffs and etc. There are also a lot of halal restaurants in this area. Cafes are everywhere. Come to this place for sightseeing, shopping and eating all the way. "
Fun & bustling,"I had a great time shopping with my friends in this area. There were both mixes of traditional stuff and modern fashion. If you look around, you can find in the nook and crannies many other shops that have accessories, bags, and trinkets. It's a nice walk at night too with many lights and people. I went with a group of two other girls, so it was relatively safe and fun. It did take at least an hour to get tired of the place, only because of all the walking. Walking around the area is nice too."
Peaceful,If you looking for halal food especially for Muslim.. you may come here..A lot of halal restaurants with so many choices.. I went to Eid Halal Restaurant and the food is daebak!!
Change your currency here for best rate!,"This place has everything in one. Stay - numerous guesthouses to pick from. Prices ranges cheapest compare to other places in Seoul. Most of them located very near to the subway. Eat - various kind of restaurants from local Korean food to international. For Muslim, this is definitely a heaven for food and chances to try halal Korean food. Hip cafes are spread across the area aswell. Shop/Sightseeing - Lots of small shops, try walking in smaller path. There are even underground shopping centre. My friend bought a lot of handbags at bargain price here, better than in Dongdaemun area, and less crowded too. We was trying to take picture in LINE shop in Myeong-Dong and decided not to since there was too many people. LINE fans, fret not, they have another shop here with way less crowd.Seoul Central Masjid was bigger than I imagined. Check out the mural along the path beside the masjid. Money changer - We got the best deal to exchange money here compare to other shops we saw at Myeong Dong or Hongdae area."
Multicultural Environment in Seoul,"If you're a tourist visiting Seoul and want to see another side of Seoul, just come to Itaewon! Itaewon is like a mini version of world in Seoul. You can find many people from different race and countries in this place. For foods, there are soo many options and for moslem, this is just the center of halal food that you can find.There are many stores selling halal products and Seoul Mosque also located in Itaewon. Walking around in Itaewon might help you to cure your crave of your country. And, this is the place where you can find people speaking English in every corner ;)"
Interesting Area with variety ,I visited Itaewon and found the topography and variety of the district interesting. Wander away (or stay if that's your scene) from the American naval base fuelled trashy part of Itaewon to little Turkey and little India streets near the mosque and get a great view over Seoul. Keep walking past that to the cute streets where many nice bakeries and artist run shops have flourished in recent years. I was surprised by the alternative and cosmopolitan vibe. 
muslim community is here,"to all muslim people, itaewon is one of the most place in seoul to visit. here it has a itaewon mosque. also you can find the a lof of halal food here and the restaurant..very attraction place for foreigner is live here.. can access here by subway, taxi or city bus...so many shop in here and must to visit this place..."
Interesting place,"Itaewon was an interesting neighbourhood to visit for an afternoon. There's some shopping there (international brands like Vans and Aldo) but things are pretty expensive. There are a few souvenir shops as well. The walk up to the Seoul Central Mosque was tiring but pretty worth it. Lots of food to eat here as well; kebabs, briyani, authentic Korean food and Malay food as well."
"Shopping, eating, walking","Upper class shopping and eating, with a western tourist orientation. Some clothing and shoes, souvenirs, also antiques shops. In Hamilton shopping mall decent prices for local products of all kinds, prices are negotiable. Lots of different cuisines and very good restaurants for those wanting other foods that Korean."
Korea - part 1,"Staying at Roy' white house gueshouse... Its a simple and small apartment yet suits us perfectly...Itaewon- city with multiracial communities. Food not a problem for muslim if visiting Itaewon... Clothes, souvieniers, boots, shoes, etc anything u can find it here.. Even the branded clothes- adidas, nike, sketchers to name a few."
Nightlife district,"This is definitely NOT a shopping area because everything seems expensive here even just an ordinary souvenir shirt where you can simply find anywhere at Seoul. I can see that this is the place where the expats hang out. But if you cross at the other street, Korean food here are so yummy! You grill your fresh meat at this said restaurants. Bar-b-que or grilled pork, Kim chi and vegetable wrap are the best! We kept coming back to Itaewon but we prefer where the locals eat and drink because they're the best resto with the best korean grilled pork and vegetable wrap ;)"
very nice area to spend your night and enjoy a great night life,"it took us 15 minutes from our hotel "" Glad Hotel "" next to the National Assembly in the south to Itaewon in the north and it costed 12000 Wons equal to almost 12 US$ by taxi.the area was very much pleasant . there are lots of bars and night clubs which will for sure suites any sorts of interest. we went there in the middle of the week . so it was not busy . and there were only two places which required entry fees but the rest were with no entry fee. UN was the one we went in . it was a nice area. at about 2 am it got much busier . If you are also a fan of eating , there are lots of restaurants which can give you different taste of food . you can find almost any type of restaurant there. the second time we were there was in the Halooween night . it was superb. very busy and filled with different sort of face makeups which are in harmony with this night. Everywhere were full and all the night clubs required entry fees which varied from 10,000 to 25,000 ."
"Great town, but lots of expats here.","Filled with many expats here, so it's fairly easy to find food that aren't originally from Seoul. (Eg. Indian or Moroccan cuisines can be found easily here, great for muslims). I was advised by my Korean friend that it isn't 100% safe for female solo travelers to come here as it is populated with more male expats than female- they will really check you out so, wear modestly and best to explore with a friend :)"
Happening place,"Itaewon is a very happening place in Seoul, many shops, bars, restaurants and clubs. Best to go at night to feel the energy there. Many expats and locals hang out there. it is a nightlife hot spot."
Plan for a weekend ,"Not so far from the memorial of the Korean war. It is about 15min walk up the main street. I think Itaewon is the most visited area by shopping-holic and also the largest gathering foreigners in Seoul . However I could find cheaper items in other areas.The area is full of shops, restaurants, bars etc... And if you would like to have full experience of the place, plan your trip to be in the weekend, cause the street market is held only that time. "
Cool village,"It is a cool village where you can find many different culture, restaurants and shops. I have a good experience when I was there I could see the Itaewon Global Village Festival"
Dynamic!!,"We enjoyed being in Itaewon each time we visited, day or night, it’s just vibrant.The street stretch begins and ends with and arch like structure on road saying Welcome to Itaewon. It’s a must visit place when in Seoul, it’s a place where one would definitely go crazy for shopping and Halal food options. Be it ice cream or Korean, Indian, Arabic or any cuisine, it’s just awesome, it has free WIFI as well all over to update you whereabouts on social media instantly ;) LOLA perfect place to hangout wide variety of shopping for cosmetics, clothes, toys, souvenirs. One of the night when we visited we walked up hill to see how the ambience is like… there are many bars and restaurants. We walked a few steps in that lane and returned as it’s not our interest. On the last day of our visit after we enjoyed our meal it started pouring… and trust me that was the day….. me and my partner had fun filled afternoon… people are waiting for rains to stop and we were taking the pleasure to the most…. We packed all our stuff in a borrowed plastic bag and dumped in our bag… started making video of the street and water flowing… people were looking at our craziness and wondering what were we up to… common we were on Holiday!! Finally after about an hour it stopped pouring and we completely drenched took a cab back to our Hotel!We packed wonderful memories back home from Itaewon."
Lively international area of Seoul.,"Itaewon seems to be a bit touristy and maybe I ordinarily wouldn't like it but we visited it on the day of vibrant festivities. Itaewon Global Village Festival really reflects the spirit of this place. Hamilton hotel's unattractive architecture does not seem to matter- it is undeniably the anchor of this neighborhood. Itaewon is about shopping, possibly partying and eating familiar things. At the entrance to the neighborhood there is a map of the area helpful in planning your exploration. The roadside stalls are even more attractive than the 2000 stores of Itaewon."
Too touristy,"Itaewon is a great place, if you would like to see many tourists and eat the food you would eat at home. All the major brand names have a shop in Itaewon. Highlight for our kids was the Hello Kitty Cafe."
"Not the Same Old Itaewon, New and Improved","I first visited Itaewon in 1985 when it was known as GI shopping and Juicy Bar area only frequented by GIs, tourist out to shoo, prostitutes and the rare or brave Koreans desiring to meet foreigners. Really The average Korean looked down on this place. But over the last few decades the place has transformed into a trendy spot filled with great restaurants and pubs frequented by locals and expats alike. The area behind the Hamilton Hotel is filled with fun pums and restaurants that ared shared between all. The night life here is vibrant and fun. Just people watching while you grab a cold one is a blast. Now if you cross the other side of the street there are still some seedy places, particularly on the hill behind the fire station. Juicy bars still remain as do transgender bars which demonstrate the changing times in Korea. One can stll shop for cheap stuff along the main drag of Itaewon-ro and its side alleys if that is your thing, but I would recommend the trendy side of the street mentioned above. Many who recall the seedy Itaewon of the past and avoid the area. But the place is fun and in a constant stage of evolution. Give it a try."
Street Shopping,"If you're a first timer to Korea,this place is a must. For a muslim traveller like myself ,it is easy to find a halal food in this area. There are a lot of shops here as well from T''shirts to all kind of souvenirs. But just take note, most of this shop's close after 6pm. You must plan in advance and don't go there for shopping at night."
"Been there, done it, didn’t buy the shirt.",I heard a lot about Itaewon and all the market areas they had to offer. Maybe I would have had a better experience if I was travelling with somebody who knew the area. It was tough to navigate around and very easy to get lost once you go into some of these shopping areas. It was a bit dirty and all the stores primarily had the same stuff. I’m not big into haggling for stuff and hate to be coheres into going into stores.
If you don't like this there is something wrong,"Have stayed in Itaewon several times now and wouldn't go anywhere else in Seoul. The main street has always been full of shops and stalls, but the bars and restaurants are getting better and more numerous all the time. If you go down hill alongside the army base this area is also exploding and getting really exciting."
Nice place to eat western food and hang with foreigners,"But is that what you really want to do in Korea? Maybe sometimes. Itaewon is a nice district to hang out in now and then to get your western food cravings taken care of before heading back to wherever else in Korea you're going or living. I like it for its western feel, but it definitely can feel like a bubble for foreigners in the mid south of Seoul. Then again, so can Hongdae, the university district. Anyplace where young Koreans are attracted to are more likely to feel this way. I can recommend this district if you're feeling a particular hankering for familiar food or unfamiliar cute socks."
unique place to see minority of muslims in korea,"love the place, awesome place, many halal food and also one supermarket selling all the halal frozen foods,"
Not a market really,Just a street with stalls selling cheap fake Calvin Klein underwear and such. Side streets have multitude of fin restaurants and bars though 
Very unique the city of Seoul.,"When i visited this city, i felt like being in other country. It has multi cultural tastes. Arabic, oriental, European, Korean..Most of all, it' close to centre of Seoul ,CITY HALL . It means you can easily access to all the way to trip. "
Good variety of food ,The blend of food in terms of variety and quality is highly appreciated and therefore recommended - place can be explored on foot with international shopping centre too 
Very diverse area,"First time in Seoul, this has to be the most diverse area in the whole of South Korea!night life in this area is okay-ish. As I am not really a night life kinda person!"
Night life fun time,"this is one place in seoul to go round september time when you still have the warmth but not so much humidity and you can go to one of the many bars or restaurants and sit people watching, or one of the rooftop terraces and meet friends. Great place and one I'll keep going back to"
hipster meets tradditional meets multicultural melting pot,"If you like people gazing, feel somehow transported outside of korea but still be in Korea this is your type of spot. So many foods, and cultures blending together due to the old US military post that was stationed there, but since have moved. I definitely would recommend this place for people who love to hang out at night, and just keep the party going."
Hipster location,This was a very busy area. Great to walk around and people watch. Lots of places to eat. This would also be the party area.
Good party area at least for South-Korean standards.,"Good party area, at least for South-Korean standards ;). Many expats, young people, restaurants. Better do not go up the hill, it does not look so safe."
"Great for a night out , but not wheelchair friendly.","We stayed at a vacation rental house in the heart of Itaewon, about 3 mins walk to the station. This area is very hilly and is good if you have strong legs ! ( reminds me of Central and Sheung Wan in Hong Kong). My daughter injured her leg and is on a wheelchair and we are traveling now with elderly parents , hence the walk on uneven road is challenging .....by an estimate , I think there is about 30% of the road that is not too wheelchair friendly. Seoul is generally not too handicap friendly as well. You rarely see people on wheelchair. (I saw 3 in the last 5 days) The back lanes and isles have so many great restaurants we wish we could stay and try many more ......The antique furniture street is a fun walk to look, laugh and chat with families and friends.Overall is great apart from roads unevenness .....and o yes, I should mention that , many trash are left on sides of the roads ..."
This is your run of the mill tourist trap,"Although the prices are cheap, so are the goods. Having explored a few other shopping districts in Seoul I wished I hadn't wasted my time or money on the beer flooded streets of Itaewon. Leave this district for bar crawling. If you do end up shopping here. Look for frames by Mr. Lee down on the left past the wide street stairs and his beautiful antique water color shop. Some of his prints matched exactly what I saw at Buddhist temples on our city tours. I wish I could have stopped in to buy more."
Great bars and restaurants ,"Itaewon is a great place to hangout with friends. There are many restaurants and bars in the area. If you want to try the traditional Korean food, then this might not be the right place. But if you wanna try some fusion food, then here is the perfect spot. They provide really good service. Also, all the architectures here are quite stylish. What's more, there is a Lady M cake boutique around the corner. So, if you need some sweetness, here is definitely what you want! Also, on the street, you could find many places selling the little souvenir stuff. You can bargain with for price."
Nice place to shop if you like getting popular brands on a bargain,"Foreign brands were having a sale when we went there. Got plenty of items at Skin Food. Was actually confusing and difficult to navigate. Wasn't able to check out a vegan resto because it was so difficult to locate. When a friendly shop owner was finally able to tell us where it is, we didn't have the time to check it anymore as the hotel shuttle was about to arrive at the drop-off/pickup point."
