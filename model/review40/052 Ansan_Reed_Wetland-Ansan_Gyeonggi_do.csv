Eh.. Okay,"Korea has a great selection of parks and walking trails. So I have been fortunate since staying here to have visited a wide variety. However, this park was a bit disappointing. There is a lot of construction activity going on nearby which resulted in a lot of noise. The park is not also particularly easy to find. Thankfully I was able to spot the turn off in time as not to miss it. In the winter the park closes early so make sure to arrive in the morning if you are interested in visiting. Overall, I wouldn't make a special trip to come and visit this park. There are many other more relaxing parks in Korea."
Good place to walk,"I could ride a bike to this place along the bicycle road by foreshore. I enjoyed the beautiful scenery reed and wetland made, listening lots of birds singing and the croaks of frogs."
Nice place to get away from the crowds.,"I've gone here a couple times for weekend birdwatching although it's closed this winter to prevent bird flu. It preserves a small patch of marshland (most of which is being converted to industry in the Ansan area). Some of the areas on the edge of the park are a bit polluted, but the core areas are fine. There's also a nice exhibit hall. The nearby riverside promenade seems popular with walkers and cyclists, though most don't go near the park. Also, there's supposed to be a bus that goes there, but I've never seen one. "
Awesome place for cycling and jogging,It's a beautiful track besides marsh.... The air is normally cool n refreshing....its a really good spot for jogging n cycling especially in summer
