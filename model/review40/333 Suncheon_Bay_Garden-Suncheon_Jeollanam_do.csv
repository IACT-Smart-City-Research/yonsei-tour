Big flowery garden,This place has some similiarities to Singapore Garden by the Bay but I still prefer Suncheon Bay as it is much bigger and more theme added. I think a day is just sufficient to walk the whole park. Closed at 7pm thou and not open at night
Beautiful park,"Suncheon Bay Garden is a vast garden that is almost like a theme park containing gardens with variety of themes (mostly other countries) along with a couple of rides (mainly to easily cover the distance of the vast park), theater, and some flamingos. While the admission might seem bit high for a garden it will take a good three hours to walk around and see everything. In early May, it was already getting too hot so it’s probably not that pleasant for about half of the year. Most of the park is very scenic and is covered with colorful flowers with hundreds of photogenic spots. The Suncheon Lake area with the small hills were especially scenic. Most of the country-themed gardens were tacky though. For example, the Netherlands garden had a windmill, Thai garden had an elephant, Mexican garden had some ceramic cacti, and the German garden had a Volkswagon Beetle. Despite those, the Korean garden and the field of rapeseed flowers along with the lake were picturesque and worth the price of admission. "
Beautiful gardens with wonderful art works,"Fabulous gardens in stunning condition and with art, culture, history and performance for everyone's taste."
Garden Walk,"It is really nice, I would recommend a visit. There is a section for each country, some of the sections are a bit disappointing, but if you're going for the general experience then it's great. Spring is the best time to go. "
Immerse yourself in this beautiful garden,"This is my third time visiting Suncheon Bay Garden and I still love it. This place is really big so be prepared to spend about 3-4 hours exploring this garden. If you like photography, this would be a great place to take some shots of the beautiful scenery. If you are a nature lover, you will definitely love this place. Highly recommend you to come here during Autumn."
Stunning view and beautiful nature of Suncheon Bay National Garden,"Here is the world of colorful flowers and trees so yoy can not only see the beautiful view here but also tale picture with many special and impressive concepts on the hill with friends or family. Feel lile a get-away from complicated and crowded city life,this is the most ideal place ever where you can enjoy the fresh air and quiet atmosphere. Highly recommend for those who wanna go to healing your soul at weekend :)"
Very pretty and nice design,"The place is really beautiful, i can say this is the little Europe of Korea. The garden is well concept, and you can try the hands on experience with Korean medicine to make soap or room perfume"
Second time and still cant finish the whole place ,"This place is hugeeee we couldnt finished it. Lot of experience to do, making soap, parfume, traditional game, tradional fragrance, hanbok rental,organic food. Family friendly but super crowded during weekend "
Impressively built with lots to offer,"The gardens are the best place to welcome and say goodbye to any season. While you can have fun in the gardens, you can also play Korean traditional games, make soaps and fragrances, ride on the choo choo train and buy local goods. Seriously~ the local food store is filled with locally produced goods from suncheon and they are extremely delicious~~ make sure to grab some of the bread from the store, it's just across the parking lot"
Amazing day at the park,It is huge and beautiful. A lot to see and explore. It got crowded even though it was off season (october). Be there on time to avoid long lines...
Beautiful,"We decided to alight at the Gardens station on a whim while taking the Suncheon City Tour Bus. Both of us were not particular gardening enthusiasts, so we thought it would be a brief visit. Instead, we spent most of our day here. If you take the Suncheon City Tour Bus, you can get a slight discount on the entrance fees. Recommend comfortable walking shoes, sunblock and umbrellas if you intend on spending the day here, it can get quite sunny and the shaded areas are far and few in-between."
The garden park in a wide area,"This is a garden park in Suncheon Bay. Must-visit course in Suncheon Travel. I highly recommend.- Locating upper area of Suncheon Bay, it's about 15~20 min by bus from Suncheon Station.- At the ticket office, 2-day pass for 6 attractions of Suncheon is available. Or buy ticket for Suncheon Bay Garden. Seniors with 65+ are free.- There are amazing cone-shaped hills, tile bridge, parades, global gardens, flamingo pond, bicycle boats, Metasequoia Road, etc.- With a massive area, spending at least 3 hours is recommend.- Near the west gate, there's Eco Trans Station for Sky Cube connecting to Suncheon Bay Wetland Reserve.- Suncheon Local Foods Direct Market is locating in southeast area. It's a fine place to purchase fresh local products."
Gardens Galore,"This place is quite large and you could easily spend the whole day here exploring everything if you were so inclined.Lots of different garden designs and plenty of photogenic installations just asking to be photographed and Instagrammed.The place is very popular even with the locals with bus load upon bus loads of tour groups arriving all throughout the day, so be prepared for the crowds and the ensuring hoardes wielding the obligatory selfie sticks."
Suncheon National Garden,"Lovely park with many themed gardens. There are several international gardens featuring plants and trees from Thailand, Italy, Holland, Germany, America and more. There is a fantastic rock garden and an indoor tropical garden. All the gardens are beautifully landscaped and pleasing to the eye."
"Really beautiful place, half a day is good","Great place to bring your family along, or for people to take ootd at. It's a huge area with many themed gardens. Kids have different places to play at, adults can pay to join for a tea session, It's a really pretty area, each giving a mesmerizing effect. tip: wear a good pair of walking shoes, wear a lot of sunscreen and drink lots of water"
Enjoyable Daytime Adventure,"The park is beautiful. In early summer and fall the colors of the flowers are gorgeous. Sculptures and different themed mini gardens are enjoyable to walk through. Crowds are expected, wear comfortable shoes it can take several hours to walk around and look at everything. Really beautiful place to explore."
Huge garden with special mini theme gardens,"This garden is huge! While the garden in itself does not boast of anything special, there are many mini themed gardens in it. We enjoyed looking and taking photos of these themed gardens a lot. As you'd have to walk for a few hours, bring water and snacks to refresh yourself. Alternatively, there are a few cafes including Angel-in-us Café where you can refresh yourself. There are many free public toilets in the garden too."
Artificial park designed by famous western architect,The only interesting thing about the park is the philosophy behind the walking trails that newer meet each other when you walk up and down.
planned garden only beginning to develop,"if you like planned gardens with few natural features but many photo ops in it, then this is your place. You follow arranged paths find 'world gardens' representing different countries (whatever that means) and jostle with crowds for a good photo shot.Great for letting children run around. It may mature and become more interesting. If you are looking for a 'natural' experience, go to a mountain instead"
Jewel of Jeollanamdo,Great place for walk. It is huge so it takes a whole day to walk around the garden. It has various types of gardens from different country with different concept. Every corner has a great spot for photography. Personally it is best if you visit in Spring. Summer is too hot as you get to walk in the sun although there are some places with shades of massive umbrellas or trees.
Mud skippers!!!,"I didn't realize that Mud skippers (those fish that can come out of the water) existed in Asia. From the raised walk way, you can view these fish come out of the water and move around the mud. I can feel evolution taking place (fish to amphibians). Bring your camcorders to record these interesting creatures. There are crabs, cranes and other migratory birds that visit this area. I highly recommend it."
Combination of Natural and Constructed Landscapes,"My wife and I really enjoyed walking around the gardens. The different displays from various countries were great, and we liked the combination of art, landscaping, and plants. We almost didn't take the SkyCube to the actual wetlands, but we did and didn't regret it. They are very beautiful and I wish we had more time to explore the paths and trails (it was our fault that we didn't, not the gardens). It was definitely worth the price of admission."
A natural area and formal gardens,"As nature lovers, our group thoroughly enjoyed our all day visit (W8000 admission.) We spent some time in the formal gardens (great photo ops!) then took the SkyCube (W8000 fee) to the reed marshes. Birdwatchers in the group were excited to see a flock of hooded cranes, little egret, gray heron, Daurian redstart, brown-eared bulbul, Eurasian magpie, bullheaded shrike, Eurasian nuthatch, parrotbill, Chinese grosbeak, common pochard and Eastern spot-bill duck. Gardeners loved the bonsai chrysanthemum display, the Dutch garden, the greenhouse and the rock garden. We walked over 12,000 steps so biking may be the way to go. We visited on a weekday and it wasn't busy. I think we were the only nonKoreans there. Several cafes are inside the garden with limited menu plus snacks. Suncheon area is friendly to tourists but have few English speaking taxidrivers, hotel staff, etc."
Long Walk,"You'll walk a long field of reeds, this is known as Ecological Park or Wetlands.Interesting to know that there is no electricity on this place, that even 282 electric poles were moved back to protect wildlife. With that, my slow walking became faster as I don't want to roam around the area when its getting dark."
Worldwide gardens on show,This place shows gardens from different parts of the world. Very beautiful place. You will need to walk a lot to absorb all the different gardens or take the tour shuttle tram through the park.
waste of time,"crowded place with paths to walk around and see trrees and shrubs; I'm from the Pacific Northwest so maybe I am spoiled by the natrual beauty around me, this would not even be a tourist location back home"
April is azalea season and how,"Stunning place.A half day picnic with a separate Sky Cube ride recommended to laze, take in the garden, visit the excellent Wetland centre and shop for saplings."
Tranquil and spacious,"It has been designated as a national garden on 2015.9.5 If you're a running man fans, you may want to visit here. Single entrance for the Garden costs 4000won, ecological park costs 7000won, so it is best to buy the joint ticket for only 8000won. From Suncheon train station, take bus #66, it is a short ride, about 10mins. Gardens with various themes, it is a lovely place to take a stroll."
Amazing view,We were hike to the peak by the bay and look all over the the beautiful reeds field. I have breathtaking moments on there and I feel like I'm refreshed somehow.
Wonderful and good conditions Garden,"It was wonderful to know these Gardens, all the areas Clean and very good care. A lot of varieties of trees and plants and a very good scenography, all Details with amazing decoration and keeping armony with nature, I really enjoy this visit. I think to observe all details and to keep some pictures of most importan details, It should needs at least two days. I consider a very exciting visit and a good chance to have contact with nature and enjoy fresh air and landscaping."
Suncheon Bay Garden,"It takes more than three hours to walk around all countries-themed gardens taking pictures. There are Korean-, Japanese-, French-, Spanish-, American-, Thai-styled gardens to mention some of displayed gardens. If you don't like to walk, don' worry. There is tram cars, but you can't get off till the end of riding."
Great place for photography,"The garden was bigger and prettier than I expected! The pictures came out really really nice and the flowers were really well-maintained. However, you might need to allocate more time to visiting this attraction cause it's really big and all the picture-taking is more time consuming than expected. I was there for about 3 hours and did not manage to cover some of the countries-themed gardens. Great for people who want a relaxing walk by a really beautiful scenery."
Loving the gardens!,"My favorite is the French Garden, hands down. I had always liked that kind of garden design, and there's a gazebo as well! Me and my mom only visited German Garden and Indoor Garden other than the French Garden due to limited stamina and time, but I bet the other gardens are nice. German Garden was simple and I don't know what to relate to the overall look of it to anything German, but maybe if a German is to go there, he/she could explain better.When I came here two days ago there's not that many people, but maybe tourism was slowed down due to MERS. If you have a lot of time, I'd suggest this place. This place is a very nice place to take a stroll, and again, who doesn't love gardens?Language:As expected, almost nobody speaks English, but they can explain by body language about the map. My mom understood the person telling us about the map but I am bad with maps.. so...The signs in the garden have English though so don't worry about getting lost. Every few hundred meters there should be a signpost telling you which way is what site."
"One year on, it still fascinates ne","The park is very big, this is my second time I visited the place and yet the feeling I have is refreshing.There are toilet points and refreshment areas... Lovely place to visit if you love nature.The park has different themes too! Interesting visit"
Beautiful park,"I took my family here over the weekend. We planned to spend about an hour and ended up staying for four hours. It is a beautiful park and well kept. There are plenty of small things to keep the interest of young kids (plants grown in the shape of giant fish, an elephant made out of mesh wire, etc.). Part of the park is dedicated to recreating classical gardens from other parts of the world and was quite interesting to walk through, although I would be curious to know how authentic they are. Admission costs 2,000 Won per adult for the park only. Children 6 and younger are free. They also had free stroller rental (is it a rental, if it is free?) for children 36 months and younger."
"Beautiful, even in winter ","I would definitely love to see it in the summer, but even in the winter it can take hours to see. Great for just walking around and taking pictures. The ticket also includes the Bay in the same day. "
