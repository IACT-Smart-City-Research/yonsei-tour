The place where Dasan Yakyong Jeong's birthplace and tomb,"CYC(2013. 2)Dasan Yakyong Jeong was the representative Silhak scholar in Joseon. There is no entrance fee. In this site, there is a neat birthplace house and tomb burying Jeong and his wife. And there is a memorial hall of Jeong's with monument about him. This site is not big and not special. 10 minutes should be enough time to look around."
