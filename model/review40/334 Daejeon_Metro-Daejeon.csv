Easy to use tokens,Again as in all South Koreon metros instructions are in English. If you struggle people always offer to help
Daejeon Metro just getting started compared with other cities,"We used the Daejeon Metro a few times, it functions well but compared with other Korea cites it has only one line as opposed to many lines. Compared to towns getting large numbers of foreign visitors the metro signage in English did not seem to be as good. Still usable though."
"only one line, but very efficient","Unfortunately, Daejeon has only one metro line, but this line connects Daejeon station and the Yuseong area.Access is easy, and there are escalators and elevators at every station which makes it also easy when you travel with luggage.Trains run every 10 minutes throughout the day and every 5-6 minutes during morning and evening rush hour on weekdays."
"Cheap, Fast and Reliable","Fastest way to get around Daejeon, simple to navigate, clearly signed, destination announcements in English and always helpful staff on hand if you get a bit lost."
"Clean, Efficient and Excellent Value","Quite a simple metro system, but the plus side of this is that it is easy to navigate.Either buy a metro card at one of the local convenience stores - we currently have ones with Kakao characters on - or buy tickets for single journeys from the vending machines in all stations. Cards can be topped up at machines in the stations with Won notes and larger denomination coins, with an option to hear the instructions in English. Our son, who lives in Daejeon tells us that he just uses his bank card to pay and that one can also use a mobile phone, but he has a Korean bank account, and we haven’t tried it with UK cards.There is a definite code of conduct to be followed - queue to the left and right of the doors to enable travellers to exit the train first, no loud speaking on the train and make sure not to sit in one of the priority seats, which are reserved for the elderly, pregnant women and people with physical needs.Information is displayed on screens within the carriages and also via loudspeaker and is given in Korean and English. There are also maps of the line above every door. The Instructions will tell you which side of the train the platform is going to be.Some stations have up to 10 different exits and, whilst it isn’t the end of the world if you take the wrong one (you might just end up on the other side of a crossroads to where you want to be), it does help if you know your exit number.I have always felt perfectly safe on the Metro and would be quite happy, as an older woman, travelling alone. People are always friendly and helpful, when needed - young people are more likely to be able to speak English if you need assistance."
Short system,"system is limited in coverage, therefore cannot travel to a lot of places compared to other cities with subway system"
Clean but long interval,"Daejeon has the only one subway line yet. So clean but has long interval. If you miss one, should wait for almost 10mins"
No way to lose oneself ,It's a single line subway traveling almost every part in Daejeon. Ride on it and get off to your destination. 
The fastest way to get around town,"As a foreigner living in Daejeon, it is oftentimes difficult to travel without carrying a stack of taxi-cards which tell the driver where you want to go in Korean language. Using the Metro is the answer. As long as you know where you want to get off, it is the least expensive and enjoyable way to travel. Many businesses provided instructions regarding which exit to take once you have reached your destination, which helps immensely. People are often very friendly and it's a good opportunity to ""study the locals"" in their own environment. Lots of fun!"
Use metro to avoid road traffic!,Daejeon metro is a single line rapid subway system with 22 stations along a 22.6 Km long track. It operates from 5:30 AM in the morning to the midnight. It starts from Panam in the north-western part of the city to Banseok in the eastern part of the city. Daejeon station is one of the station in this subway line where passengers can exchange to KTX and other train services. Every station has its name in Korean and English which makes it easier for a foreigner while traveling.
"Affordable, Clean, Fast.","The metro is one awesome straight line and the best way to travel in Daejeon. The buses are small, with few seats and a lot of drivers are too wild for my sanity. The subway has numerous seats and friendly people. Get a *Tmoney card if you plan to use the subway frequently; it saves you money. It costs me 1,250 won ($1.25 USD) for every ride. There is a small discount applied every time the Tmoney card is used and it can be used on buses for FREE transfers within a certain time limit (30 to 90, depending on weekdays and weekends). I live near the first station stop, Panam. I believe it takes 50 to 60 minutes to travel to the last stop Banseok. If you travel past a certain number of miles you will be charged an additional 100 won (.10 cents). The metro runs approximately every 12 minutes and is usually on time. It gets crowded at the popular stops (Daejeon Station, City Hall, etc.) Do not expect men to give up seats for women or for natives to cover their mouths when they cough or sneeze. There are designated seats for pregnant, elderly and disabled individuals. On the weekends the last sub car is used for bike commuters. There are racks for luggage above the seats. There are decent bathrooms at every station. The exit numbers are clearly marked and many of the employees can help you find the correct exit number if you have a location name, map, or address. It helps if they are in Korean. A lot of signage is in English, which makes it easier for a person who gets lost easily (me). Foreigners should be mindful of talking too loudly on phones or with friends, regardless of this you will be stared at so be prepared. =) *Note: Buy the tmoney card at the local convenince stores - CU and GS25; add money to the card there as well or at the station. Cards range in price depending on if you get a basic to preloaded cards. Buy a card that can be used in the entire country. I use the same card in Busan, Seoul, Jeju, etc."
Metro,"There is just one line in Daejeon, compared to 10+ in Seoul. Trains are smaller too. Efficient as other cities. The best public transportation in the world"
"Very fast, clean and safety","During my trips I found that in Metro do cleaned, safety and crowded of people. U can meet all nations from over the world. I like to travel and this is my 2nd time in korea. Here is so safety!! Yes it's expensive city but it deserves this prices☺ u can travel with tcards. This card uses everyone it's universal u can use it everywhr. So I recommend u to travel by metro and do not do try abt anything"
Hints on this place,"1) In most cases people trevel to Daejeon after Seoul or Incheon. If you are going to use metro more than once use T-money card — it's universal transportation card in Korea. You can get it in a vending machine in Daejeon, Seoul or Incheon airport. Put money on a card and pay for metro on entrance.2) Generally you can return any ticket and get refund! Don't drop even used single ride ticket. Use deposit refund machines that are usually situated near vending machines. But in Daejeon I haven't seen them (but I think they exist). In any cases, you can drop your T-card on your way back to Incheon.3) Average waiting time between train is 10 min at daytime.4) Watch for special pink seats for pregnant women. )5) WC in a stations.6) Elevators."
