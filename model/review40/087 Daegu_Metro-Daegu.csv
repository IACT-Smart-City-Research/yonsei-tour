Daegu Metro,"Very good, nice to travel in and look down on the city, metro was clean and punctual I would recommend and use again"
Easy to Use,As in all of South Korea the metro is easy to use here. Instructions are in Englsh and local people happy to help if you look lost. AS elsewere we found young Koreans did not give up their seat for the more elderly. Although we are not young we gave our seats to those less able to stand when needed.. 
Crowded but easy to use,As with most things in Asia and Korea in particular the metro is crowded. It’s relatively clean and a lot of signs are in English and Hangul. It’s easy to maneuver and I recommend it over taxis if you are doing a bunch of running around in Daegu.
Quick and efficient,"Pretty easy to navigate, there are signs and maps everywhere (helpful if you can read Korean but there is English as well). As two Americans traveling in Daegu, we did get a few stares from the 아저씨 but no one was rude. Easy way to get around 대구 quickly, especially if you have a TMoney card."
Very Convenient and Clean,The transit system in Daegu is very cheap and convenient. There are several lines with some transfers. The system is modern and very clean. 
Wow,Daegu Metro is not so big but easy to understand how it works. Good thing is that Seoul Metro card works also there and in Busan so it makes traveling lot easier. 
Very convenient and efficent subway in Daegu!,"Used the subway several times while staying in Daegu. Just like most subway systems in Korea, it is an absolute joy to use them."
Fast and convenient,Great and convenient! Not expensive if u have T money card of course. Links very well all the city area
Quick but lacks coverage,"The Metro is a great way to get around, but much of the town is not covered by it. If your start/end is near a station, I fully recommend this cost effective way to get about."
Convenient ,The Metro is very easy to figure out. The price is great. It is very convenient. The red line runs between 0545 and 2345 every day. 
More English signage please,"Convenient to have shops around here but I think I tripped off several alarms going into escalators going the wrong way.Otherwise, it was very educational and pleasant getting around with the metro."
Easy to navigate,Would definitely choose the metro over a car or taxi. Coupled with the Naver Map app it's a breeze to get around.
No t-money top up machines,I bought a t-money card in Seoul and the vending machines at daegu station metro did not like the idea to top it up.
Wow!,"First time in Daegu in 38 years! Taxi ride is good, but this public transit system is awesome!Very economical, fast, safe, and clean! This was the main way of my getting around in Daegu. I loved it. "
no problems,"no problems, very smootheasy to navigatesave your money from taxis.take the fuss free train instead."
Short trip on the metro,Very easy to use. Don’t forget to redeem your ticket at the end and get back 500 won. In doubt check YouTube. 
Efficient,"Not many lines but the 3 that are in use are quite efficient. Clean and rather cheap, this is certainly a good option providing both your departure and arrival points are on the system. Many places still aren’t. Note that for 3 people a taxi may be more economical and more convenient (but less ecological of course) as they are very cheap in Daegu.Line 3 is special nice because it's a aerial monorail offering a good view of the city."
Super!,"It's a good subway system that covers most of Daegu including reaching to Gyeongsan to the east. It's clean, convenient, and easy to use... truly a world class system!"
Super Easy to use,at first I was intimidated by subways because I have no experience using them but the system here is easy to use. the trains are very clean and air conditioned. stops are displayed in both Korean and english. 
"As a Korean, it's not special at all","As a Korean, it's not special at all. It's very similar with that of Pusan. I know Foreigners find it very clean and special, and also the system very good. To me, it's usual so... nothing special."
Great transportation,It was my second time of Daegu visiting. Metro always comes on time and can check on the application of a metro as well. I can decide when I should to leave from my accommodation definitely. Price is also reasonable. I love it 
Gets you where you need to go!,I don't have a car and I rarely feel that I need one with the excellent mass transit system here in Daegu. The Metro line is clean and efficient. 
On the way to the conference ,"They don't call it subway but city railroad. I found the reason later. They have lines most of the part above the street exposed and it looks very good. They have 3 lines of them connecting all Daegu city. If you come from Seoul, capital city, you can use the same metro card as well. "
Very nice and clean. Take Line 3,"It is very comfortable and reliable way of getting around the city. If you want to have a nice look at the city take the Line 3, which is a monorail line that takes you through the city with a view."
Easy and Safe,"Personally I would rather use the metro than any other public transport in Korea. Daegu is a big city, not as big as Seoul or Busan, but it's up there. For a larger city the metro is one of the easiest I have used. If I could get to a location by train I would. It's easy and safe. When at a stop to change trains, you can find restaurants and shops all underground. This was great during the summer because even if there is no A/c it is still much cooler down there. Everything has the Romanization of metro stops so it's easy to read if you can't read Hangul. "
Great simple,What is there to say??? Clean... efficient.... on time..... SAFE....thank God korea is not like the rest of the world. 
Just easy to take,"Dedpite the very unfamiliar sound of Korean metro stops, it is a pleasure utilising the public transport system. Most info is also in English, and really easy to use "
Hints on this place,"1) In most cases people trevel to Daegu after Seoul or Incheon. If you are going to use metro more than once use T-money card — it's universal transportation card in Korea. You can get it in a vending machine in the Incheon airport. Put money on a card and pay for metro on entrance.2) Generally you can return any ticket and get refund! Don't drop even used single ride ticket. Use deposit refund machines that are usually situated near vending machines. But in Daegu I haven't seen them (but I think they exist). In any cases, you can drop your T-card on your way back to Incheon.3) Watch for special stickers on seats for pregnant women. )4) WC in a stations.5) Elevators."
Great system,"Very efficient and clean system. Staff very helpful. Clean, comfortable ride. Commuters very courteous and will offer seats to foreigners. Signage great and many places to purchase one ride passes or load a card with WANS and ride metro, bus or ""C"" line tram."
Efficiency!!,"The subway is extremely easy to use, ticket machines in english as well as korean. 1400Won for any journey - about £1."
"Superb, Clean System","Daegu's public transport system is superb. Well marked, efficient, and a great way to get around town. Made my visit a whole lot easier"
"Easy to use, clean, cheap","The metro is incredibly easy to use, runs on time from about 6am to midnight, is inexpensive, is safe and clean and will get you most places in the city. Overall very good and generally 1000x better than driving. "
Daegu metro and monorail.,I love the metro. So easy to use and get around. You have to try the monorail. Easy access from all over Daegu. Ride the mono or metro and save time on finding a parking dot.
Inexpensive and convienient way to get around,Get the refillable pass at any station. Add money anytime to refill using the machines. Don't waste time buying tokens.
They Got a Monorail!,"That's right people, an actual Monorail that was not built in the 1950s! Daegu Metro's Line number 3 opened in 2016 and sends Monorail cars gliding above the traffic. The route has stops near downtown, Seomun Market, and Suseong Lake and is a great way to see the city from a higher vantage point if you are a newcomer or just a backpacker. Another interesting point is that as the Monorail car weaves between apartment buildings the window become opaque so that you don't violate apartment dwellers privacy.As for the other two lines, they are typical, Seoul type, subway stations and car. The exception being the area from Banwoldang to Jungangno which is a underground shopping complex packed with mostly independent vendors and is a great place to snack and browse on a rainy day.So, you may ask, with a freakin' Monorail and underground shopping why doesn't ATA give the Daegu Metro 5 out of 5? Simple, there are not enough lines. Three lines just isn't enough to zip anywhere you want, meaning that you have to switch to buses or taxi's to complete a journey sometimes. Hopefully this will change soon as the city is talking about adding another line soon."
"Clean and convenient, more lines are needed.",Best and fastest way to travel in Daegu while the streets are clogged. No searching for parking. Clean and convenient.
"Affordable, reliable and very easy to use! ","The Daegu Metro is a simple subway system that consists of 3 lines - red, green and yellow. There are clear markings in Korean and English for stations that allow for transfers between the lines. The metro is well-maintained, reliable as trains are always punctual and the cost is affordable - more so if you opt to buy a Daegu Transport card. This allows you to recharge your card and use the credit to pay for subway, taxi or bus commutes."
Easy travel from Seoul,Our organization traveled here from Seoul Station via KTX. The station is nice and has several stores as well as places to grab food.
Very easy to use,Fast and convenient way to get around the city. Highly recommend purchasing a transit card - the Daegu card works on the Metro as well as the buses. Many of the stations have numerous shops that sell clothes and various goods.
Excellent example of public transportation done right.,"Daegu has only two subway lines, and a newly opened ""Line Three"" that's actually an above-ground monorail. One of the great things about living in South Korea is the cheap and high quality public transportation, and the Daegu Metro is no exception. It's fast and convenient and will pretty much get you anywhere you need to go. If not, the buses and even taxis in Daegu are also cheap and clean."
Daegu,Very easy and convenient to use around the city. Isn't as big as the Seoul one so you should never get lost
Easy to Use,"The train system in Daegu is easy to use and very cheap at just about a dollar per ride. They have stairs, escalators and elevators and sometimes they go to different places, do so tread carefully. There are three lines with opportunity to change trains. And, there is convenience of lots of stops near markets. "
Convenient user friendly subway/metro rail system.,"Here is a very convenient, easy to use subway & metro rail system to travel around Daegu. The above ground metro rail line is good for limited sightseeing. The nearby underground PriMall is a smaller scale of Seoul's u/g shopping system."
bustling,there is a lot to do and see around this subway stop. there is also an underground shopping center. at night time the area really comes to life.
Weekly Travel,I utilize the subway to go to church and to to do shopping at jungangno. love it. I normally have never been on the subway in the states so I am definitely enjoying it.
An Efficient System,Overall the Deagu subway functions as it should safely and efficiently. It is also extremely affordable costing me less than 6 USD for my spouse and I to travel into the heart of the city. I have lived in Korea for over a year now and this is one of the most reliable forms of transportation bypassing long traffic during peak hours. The only downside is during some holidays the subway is closed for Korean citizens only due to massive exodus from the cities.
It's a subway station,It's a subway station made famous by a deadly fire. It is connected to an underground shopping mall. There is a movie theater and a Krispy crème there. Enjoy. 
Pretty cool underground shopping mall,"This station is the intersection of two subway lines, and also has a huge underground mall! The first floor is mainly jewelry, clothes, and knick-knacks, and the small second floor is mostly for food. It was cool to walk around and see the wares, even though they're very similar to what's sold everywhere else in Korea. I really like how it's underground, though, so it saves a lot of space above ground! Stop by for a look if you're near the station. :)"
Unique Shopping,"This is one of the best stations in Daegu. First of all, it is near Kyobo Bookstore and Hot tracks stationary store which was my personal favorite store in Daegu when I lived there. It is also near many great cinemas and restaurants. There were even photography studios where you could dress up in hanboks. There are also a couple great parks within walking distance."
SUBWAY STATIONS IN KOREA ARE THE BEST,I always find Korea's subway station convenient and fast! I also like shopping in the subway. It's kinda cheap and very unique!
Huge area,The station is the junction between two subway lines and offers a lot of shops and small restaurants. Difficult to find ones was if not used to it. 
Lessons to be learned!,"Organized, easy to understand, clean, on time!!! these are some of the words that fully describe this station and its cars!!! Also, underground, there are lots of small stores and places to eat. Get the hot waffles if you can!! Take your time and walk around. I sat and did a lot of people watching! Best time ever! Who knew!!!! Live and learn!"
This was the stop for downtown,Everything is within reach from here. They have great waffles served right in the subway station and usually some form of entertainment during holidays.
getting around,Many easy to read signs and exits....easy to understand and on and off stops. Shopping is very close which is important to me as I travel almost weekly.
Easy to navigate,"The subway is great, easy to use, clean and efficient. This station is located in the heart of the downtown shopping area. High end shops are just southeast of the station. Northeast are some cool shopping areas such as Outdoor Wear Street, Second-Hand Street Market and also many interesting narrow alleys full of stuff for sale. While the stuff may or may not be interesting, the atmosphere is. Also worth checking out are the many restaurants and bars found a bit further southeast of the station. The map called ""Enjoy Daegu to the Max! How to Enjoy Dongseongro Street"" covers this whole area. I got one from our hotel, but they are likely available at the many info stands in the area. The long alleys of underground shopping and cafes do offer a great way to get around without dealing with traffic or bad weather."
Great transport link for days or nights out,Area leads out to the main strip part of downtown Daegu and has A LOT of underground shopping. A lot of services such as Hoo Daegu oriental medical clinic and many plastic surgeons located near McDonalds and exit 2. A great way to see downtown Daegu for yourself using the cheap but handy subway system.
Easy to navigate,"I was really impressed with transit in South Korea, very easy to navigate even for a foreign speaking visitor. Most signs are in English and easy to find your way around."
Underground Heaven,Underground shopping mall has everything you could want for some of the cheapest prices. Located right near a nice park and the Hello Kitty Cafe
More than just a subway,"The koreans have made a business out of their subways,with bustling markets all underground.Also a good way to cross the street on busy roads,just go underground and pop up on the other side.Only drawback, you lose your suntan,as you can spend a lot of time underground browsing the markets and food stalls.Recommended, and a great way to get around the city.Fast and clean"
Heaven!,"I always like going to Jungangno station, cause there were many shops! and i like to shops (yes, im an ordinary girl who could spend hours for shopping :D) and the price were good. it was located in the downtown so easy access to go out and see another shopping paradise :D"
"cheap shopping, photo haven","I frequent this underground shopping mall at the subway station of daegu down town. You can find everything from clothing and beautiful accessories to cheap korean food. But this shopping area is famously known for its camera shops. Camera, accessories, films, you name it. Reasonably priced too and some even negotiable, good place to shop competitively since all the shops are a foot steps away from each other."
CLEAN AND EFFICIENT,"It's not only an intersection between ground world and underground facilities of subway, but also a very alive part of the city where you can do shopping through direct access to most of the mall of the city center avoiding to go outside. It's extremely clean and absolutely secure. If it's too hot in the day time of summer, it's good to come to the arcade of Jungangno."
