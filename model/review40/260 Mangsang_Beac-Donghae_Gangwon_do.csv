Easy Breezy Mangsang Beach,Strong Breeze hits the shore with Strong Waves. Refreshing and lotsa restaurants that you can choose from. We stayed in Donghae Boyang Spa Convention Hotel which is great to relax after our Spartan event
Very long beach that extends seemingly forever,"Mangsang Beach was a very nice surprise. The beach is huge, stretching for kilometers. The sand is nice and the water clean. The water gets deep very steeply, so it can be dangerous, and lifeguards have no tolerance for those who step outsied of the designated swimming areas. Another good thing is that the beach is not only long, but it's also wide, which is great for people who want to play soccer, fly a kite or just want some extra room to run around. Finally, the central area of the beach has a nice area whit various dining options, coffee shops, small stores and even a small arcade."
Good beach,"Mangsang beach.. located in the east coastal bed of south korea.. we went with an 2 year old kid. Similar to sokcho beach, the waves and depths are high for kids.. but for adults visitor, this beach is an awesome one.Overall a worth visit and not a much visit place..No cons for this beach."
Great location with minor flaws,"We (me & my fianc√©) visited Mangsang Beach in the middle of September, which should normally be monsun time, but this day was sunny and hot. In any case it was after season and additionally during the week, which resulted in the beach being almost empty. Unfortunately, ""No swimming"" signs were killing the fun right away, most likely due to strong waves and currents at this day. This was a shame as the beach is very nice and the clear, not-too-cold water would have made a great time. So we decided to just walk along the water in the southern direction.And here is what you should absolutely be aware of: The southern part of Mangsang Beach is a restricted military area, which is announced by one (!) small sign in Korean language only (photo attached). Rule of thumb: If you see barbwire to your right and the sea to your left, better turn around. We walked almost one kilometer into the restricted area, which features some nice parts of the beachline like rocks and a creek leading into the sea, before some heavily armed South Korean soldiers hastily jumped on their watchtower and blew their whistles to signal us to turn around immediately. Given that there are other watchtowers and some CCTV cameras before that, someone clearly wasn't doing his guard shift correctly... Why didn't we turn around long before? Easy - this far up north, basically the whole South Korean coastline is fortified against North Korean infiltration attempts using mini-subs. One can see soldiers patrolling along the beach on other locations, too, so the barbwire itself did not work as a particular warning to us.Enough of the scary stuff, the rest of the beach is wonderful and, given good wave conditions, clearly is an awesome place to go swimming. There were some quads and jetskis lying in front of a store, I assume they're for rent, and there are also stationary caravans to rent for a camping experience. There's also an Italian-style restaurant called ""Piano"" run by Koreans, close to the main vehicle entrance to the beach. A very neat place with little-above-average prices, but very good food, a tasteful interior and a beautiful view at the sea."
"Large beach, rude lifeguards","The beach is long and wide, so there are lots of people and no shortage of space on the sand. There are also lots of shops and restaurants, loud speakers, and the constant whistles of obnoxious, speedo-clad (horrifyingly small), lifeguards. It's not a relaxing or quiet experience, but could be fun for families and groups who'd like a lot of space. The beach/sand has a pretty sharp drop off to the water, which makes for pretty hard waves and a strong current I suppose. The lifeguards are very strict about people going out in the water. I will grant them that it's pretty dangerous, especially for people not used to the ocean or young swimmers, but they whistle non stop and very rudely order you back out of the water (I was literally standing in water up to my shins when I was whistled). One guy in a tube went out in the water a good deal further than they liked and four lifeguards dramatically swam out and pushed him back to the sand. Stick to the small and pleasant beaches around Donghae. Mangsang's waves and surf is tough and the lifeguards ruin it anyway."
