Naejangsan Temple,Buddhist temple at foot of Mt Naejangsan. We were heading for cable car to Mt Naejangsan but ended up here. 
If you are into temples you will probably like it,There is nothing much here but if you have the same practice as the monks who run the temple you should go. There is a lot of people but it wasn't that bad last year.
Blessing,"The original temple has been destroyed during wars, the current one is a reconstruction in the 1970s. Nevetheless, it is still a beautiful place to visit. Express bus to Jeongeup from Seoul or Jeonju, then local bus #171 or 171-1 to the mountain. Follow the crowds to walk up the path to reach Naejangsa Temple. The local bus from Jeongeup is always full. Take a taxi or share one with other visitors is a much convenient way to go to Naejangsan. "
peaceful and beautiful temple,"Atfer hiking Naejangsan National park in Korea, we visited this temple in evening. It was so calm and peaceful temple. There are middle high moutaions around temple. That made us feel isolated. That memory was not feel in my hometown. It was nice time with my fiance."
Between 3 and 4 point,"C1 ( 2015.08.05 ) This temple was located in Mt. Naejang national park, so had good mountain view. This temple was smaller than I guess, but had good atmosphere. Main building was restoring and made by new tree, so this main one was mismatched with another buildings. There was good temple, but I felt something wanting."
Temple under renovations,We were a bit disappointed as the main temple is being renovated. The renovation work is scheduled to be completed by 2015. 
Gorgeous Autumn hiking,"Lovely Naejangsa in Naejangsan National? Park really comes alive--with tourists and color--in autumn. It'd nice year round, but has a justifiable reputation as a fall destination."
