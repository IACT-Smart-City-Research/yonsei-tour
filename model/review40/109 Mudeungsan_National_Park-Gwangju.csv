Get an english map from the ranger station,I was all over the map (literally) until I realized the dotted lines are the park boundaries and the clear lines are the paths. I made a 3 hour hike into a thoroughly enjoyable 7 hour hike!
Great opportunity to experience some Korean nature,"We took a reasonably strenuous round trip walk through the park. It was a great way to experience a little taste of Korea's extensive forest areas. We were driven to the park entrance by local friends and a cheery park ranger gave us a park map before we started our walk. The forest was diverse and very attractive and we got good views back to the city of Gwangju from the highpoint of our walk. The trails were reasonably well signposted but only in Korean..We travelled back into Gwangju by bus which only took us about 15 minutes. It was a free ride, as the driver probably thought that was easier than trying to explain the ticketing system to us non Koreans!"
Beautiful National Park,Visited with two young kids so only hiked maybe a third of the way up but we had a great time. Park rangers were extremely friendly and one spoke amazing English and was one of the nicest Koreans we met. Trails are well marked and they have an English map at the info stations. 
Gorgeous view - serious uphill walk! ,"Sujata afterward for a cheap, all-you-can-eat Buddhist temple food vegan meal IS A MUST!! Not for the casual stroller or those with bad knees! Up up up you will go, continuously, to see lovely views at many lookout points. Great shopping at the base of the mountain. The temple is breathtaking! "
Nice fall hike,"We went up the mountain by bus and hiked down, it was quite simple and very nice. There were a lot of difficulty level options on the mountain."
Beautiful Mountain Hike ,"Love the place. Worth every bit of the travelling to this place during Autumn. We did not even manage to hike up to far, it was already beautiful. Clean and beautiful. "
"Lovely hike, beautiful autumn views","There are various routes you can choose for the climb up and you really don't need to get to the top because there is beauty every step of the way. Especially in Autumn, it is fabulous. Definitely worth spending a day there."
Mudeungsan maple tunnels,"Drove up Mudeungsan National Park for an early morning hike. The gradual slope makes it an easy climb for all. At the base of the mountain is Jeungsimsa Temple, a car park and terminus for bus No. 9 from Gwangju Bus Terminal (U-Square Terminal). Check-in at the ranger station for maps (English and Chinese available) and recommendations of walking trails. Certainly not as crowded as the more popular Naejangsan yet a great hike to enjoy the autumn foliage at a leisurely pace. The maple tunnels are at its full glory when the trees turn a hue of red, deep yellow and orange for a breathtaking canopy of colourful autumn beauty. The carpet of fallen leaves is also a magical and romantic sight to behold. Very refreshing and crisp air, good trails and friendly local hikers. Best in late October and early November. "
Fresh and Great hike!,"I was lived next to this national park since G1, I am strongly recommend this place for hikers who wants to enjoy few different course. There are several ways to climb up to top of the mountain. I had tried all types of them with my family every weekend. This place is the best place for hike with your family. During the Summer, it is hot and humid but you could enjoy it's good views and some flowers with trees. During the Winter, it is cold and hard to hike, but you could see those top view of Gwang-ju from top of the mountain.I am strongly recommend this place for family and family with young children to teens."
"Fresh air, great views, great hike!","An awesome hike through lush forest. A little crowded in some parts, I recommend avoiding weekends if possible as this is the thing to do for the locals. Hiking poles will be handy if you own them. Great view of Gwangju from the top and plenty of tracks and level of difficulty to choose from. We managed to find an English map at one of the parks information centres, otherwise take a photo of the large nap at one of the entrances. The locals were really friendly too always saying hello. Highly recommend. "
"Nice day hike, multiple entrance points could be confusing","Mudeungsan National Park is located at the eastern outskirts of Gwangju. Our guest house is at the east side of the city so we followed our host's advice to take a cab. Around 20 min cab ride for 9,500 won, not bad for 2 people. (I will talk about the bus option later)Not until we arrived the NP did we know it's huge with many different entrances (we were told each comes with a ranger station). We only told the non English speaking cab driver we wanted to go to Mudeungsan (this is pretty much all we can communicate), amazingly he drove us to the Wonhyo ranger station which turned out to be a perfect starting point for the trek to Seoseokdae & Ipseodae - the highest point of the NP with 2 most famous sets of rock formation.The ranger who welcomed us is very keen to help but his English is basic. Only after we returned from the hike did we found out there is an ranger office tucked behind with English speaking staff and trail map in English!Anyway, the return hike from the Wonhyo ranger station is 7.8km long, suggested return time is 4 hours. The first 2/3 is moderate, the last 1/3 is a little steep and slippery. There are many small rocks so sturdy boots would be helpful, so as walking poles for balance. Late August is humid so bring lots of water. When we reached the top we can tell there are many other trails to continue (probably leading back to the ranger station), but without a trail map in English while the signs along the trail don't tell the length or suggested time, we felt it's safer to go down from the same way.As mentioned previously, I highly recommend go to the ranger office ask info from the English speaking staff and get a map in English first, then you can plan the hike much better.As to public transportation, the terminal for bus 1187 is located at the entrance of Wonhyosa, which is 5 mins down the road from the ranger station. We paid a short visit to the small Wonhyosa before going back to town by bus.I would recommend the Wonhyo hiking course because the length is just right, not too difficult, and the entrance point can be reached by bus."
Long walks ,Good to be here again! Hot and humid in the city so we went for a mountain walk and it was worthy of the visit!Refreshing air...
Gorgeous park - worth seeing,"We weren't decked out for a full blown hike, but spent a few hours here walking the paved trail up to the creeks and in and around the area. There were lots of other people (kids, elderly) in a good way - not over crowded at all. The weather was fantastic, and it was very peaceful. Great place to unwind and take in nature. There were a number of people that looked like they were dressed for long hikes, but the park was welcoming to all comers.Highly recommend."
Wonderfull,This national park is really well organize for trekking and also there are many temples that you can visit and pay a respect as peaceful. Along the way you walk up there is some place for relaxing on the chairs. Worth to walk along the nature.
Easy to difficult hikes,Mudeunsan has lots of different entrance points. You can take buses like 1187 or bus number nine to go to some of the most famous temples in the mountain area. Or if you’re anywhere around the mountain there are many small paths that you can enter and just wander around in. I highly recommend taking bus 1187. This gives the best views with the most traditional backdrop available. Bus 9 entrance has become very heavily commercialized. 
Great views of the city,"It's Korea. Mountain views are everywhere in the country. However, if you find yourself in gwangju this is the areas best and easy to get to by car or bus. It is best to visit on a weekday because on the weekends it can be crazy full of people."
very good peak,We did n't dare to walk to the top but going to the entrance and taking a few snap with its background we were happy. certainly not for a winter day walk. but you'll find several photo zones if you drive around.
Highlight trip in gwangju,Wonderful view from top. Catch bus 1000 and buy monorail and chairlift tickets which next to hotel. If travel in winter wrap up. It is a highlight of Gwangju trip for us.
Mudeungsan National Park,"Lovely place where to go if you want to have a day off. The landscape from the top it is wonderful, but there are also lovely temples on your uphill path. Better go there from the end of April to the beginning of October, otherwise, it will be cold on the edge."
Superb Autumn foilage!,Mudengsan is an extremely popular place. The hike up and down can be quite strenous. The views are worth the tiring climb. Extremely beautiful autum foliage
Options for exploring Mudeungsan with limited time,"For English speakers who visit Gwangju without a car, there are several options for getting an introduction to this massive group of mountain peaks, even if you have little time. Obviously, the national park is ideal for hikers, but there are ways for non-hikers to enjoy a little of the park as well. The option we chose first was to take bus # 1000 (17 and 27 are other buses that will get you there) to the Jisan Recreational Area entrance, walk cross the street to the hotel, buy tickets for the chair lift and the monorail in the building beside the hotel, and ascend effortlessly up Hyangnobong Peak, just outside the border of the national park. From the chair lift it is an easy walk to the monorail departure station. The equipment is probably about 30 years old, so there is a small amount of risk incurred, but if you're not afraid of heights, it is well worth the ride. The monorail allows access to the Jatgogae Observatory on Hyangnobong by way of climbing a number of steps. From this viewpoint, one has an excellent view of Gwangju. The downside to taking this option first is that there is no national park office, and it would be better to have a guide to the park in English, which you can get from the national park office in Gwangju or from any of the Visitors Centers within the park. After descending by hiking (although a round trip chair lift is available and recommended if you are not used to steep, rocky trails), we managed to find another bus (# 51, 09, 29 & 29 are your options) to get to the Jeungsim Information Center. Here we found the English guide map and a nice stroll along a beautiful cascading stream to the Jeungsimsa (temple). Although the path to the temple is sharply uphill, it is a lovely place to see. The other popular route into Mudeungsan which we did not explore is to take bus # 1187 to Wonhyosa Temple; from that entrance more of the major hiking trails are easily accessible. The important thing is not to miss Mudeungsan National Park if you are visiting in the Gwangju area."
Beautiful paths so close to the city!,"It was an easy bus ride to the entrance from U-square terminal and there's no fee for this national park! There were so many paths to choose from I was kind of overwhelmed but chose the ""intermediate path"" that takes you up to Jungmeorigae Peak. The trails are well marked and there are maps at the entrance so you can see which trail looks best for you. After Jungmeorigae Peak I decided to walk down in a different direction to see Yongchupokpo Falls. I wouldn't recommend this path as the falls weren't that impressive and there seemed to be one path leading out that didn't seem too exciting. I decided to hike back up from the Falls to Jungmeorigae Peak and take the trail to Saeinbong Peak. I would definitely recommend this path. It was another beautiful view! After Saeinbong Peak, you keep going down and you exit in the parking lot of all of the restaurants and shops at the entrance of the park. There were so many other trails to explore and I will definitely be going back multiple times!"
"Beautful mountain paths, temples",This is a huge national park with many walking trails and gorgeous temples and views. Shim-jeung-sa temple was beautiful and not too difficult to to do with small children. The first part of the hike is along a road so very easy terrain (just watch out for the occasional taxi passing!). You can stock up on any kind of mountain gear at the many outlet stores at the bottom; and don't forget to eat at a bori-bap restaurant after your hike!
"Amazing view, backbreaking walk",I went here when it was still snowy and as a Dutchman you could county hiking experience on one amputated hand. The slippery way up was doable but going down on the icey track was hard. Should have brought sticks like all the old Koreans who continously passed us. But totally worth it. Amazing view. And the good geeling of accomplishment when we finally got off this Lonely Mountain.
Nice Place to Hike!,"Two sixty year olds and three kids (24-30) were able to hike this park together. It was nice that there were cement path's and we did not have to climb over rocks and tree limbs. We stopped at the Budhist temple and met a very friendly monk and his niece. There were places to stop and rest along the way, get water and use a restroom. The kids went to the top and my husband and I turned around 3/4 of the way up and went to the shops at the base and had a cold beer! My kind of hiking!"
"Excellent trails, easy transportation, food available","If you visit Gwangju, you must go to this national park. From the city center, take the bus 54 (there are many others also). A taxi from the center is only about 5 USD to the main entrance. Dozens of very well maintained trails. Lots of Buddhist temples in the park for a break. Before your hike, you can buy lots of food and drinks to take on the trail with you just next to the main parking lot. Maps in English and other languages available at the park entrance in the ranger station. Some shorter trails are all on paved roads, so any shoes will do. Others that have hiking trails you should wear appropriate footwear, though low-cut mountain shoes are fine for most hikes. Enjoy!"
It's a mountain.. yeap,Mudeungsan has seen better days. Hiked it when I lived there. Revisited and took the lift. It wasnt really nice the first time. Only gotten worse since. Wouldn't recommend this. 
遠足的好地方,"easy to get a bus to go,is near by downtown,good view .but not many information for forigan people to know about this area.whatever the information centre at train station,"
Fantastic hiking destination,"Love this mountain. Many trails to choose from, but I prefer starting from Wonhyosa on the north side of the mountain. There are less people. The Jeungshimsa entrance can get very crowded. Awesome views across Jeollansmdo and Gwangju on a clear day. Come prepared though. Despite its proximity to downtown Gwangju, it is still a very steep 1187m mountain, with sporadic water sources and erratic weather conditions. "
Hiking at Mudeungsan,"This mountain is very big. It's a good place to hike. You will see many people enjoy hiking even adults, kids, teenager, and the elder. Officers there is very nice and can inform us very well so that you can follow their suggestion. There are different level of peak to hike. I'm sure you will see a good view when you reach up there."
Best trip ever for me,"I visit this mountain on winter which was obviously a mistake but still I have good memories in that place since i meet the love there *-* if u hiking fan , my advice don't miss it "
"Beautiful, well-marked trails","Mudeungsan Park, accessible several major bus routes from downtown Gwangju (take the #9 from U-Square / Central Bus Terminal), is a beautiful natural park with well-sign-posted trails and distinctive character in every season. Some trails are easier for beginners, though many meander on and then rise sharply at well-maintained stairways. The park gets VERY BUSY starting around 10:30 / 11:00 am and the trails can be packed, so going early is always a good idea."
Beautiful,"We came of course for the red leaves. It's getting harder and harder to predict the time as the weather gets more and more strange. Thinking to come in early November will catch the last glimpse, but all the red leaves are still there, half falling, which makes the scene much more beautiful.Unfortunately it's raining. But believe me, it's still all worth it. Wow and wow. Especially for city people, like me, u hardly get to see this much anywhere else."
Amazing!,"I went to Mudeungsan National Park with my mom, uncle and auntie. We took bus number 9 (red line) at U-Square terminal and stopped at last station. I was so surprised to see a lot of old folks went for hiking. Hiking equipments can be found at the entrance of the park. There were cafes and restaurants as well. The best thing was, the internet connection was available! "
Good vegan Buddhist Buffet near this place.,"Good for a walk, from younger to senior. Fresh air, good environment for small kids because there are small park which can picnic and playground for kids.i do enjoy the museum not far walk from the entrance to the temple side, there are good calligraphy art . a artist or painter who are poem writer, use art to express his poem, Unlim museum of art（毅斎美術館） not far from the temple （証心寺）there.Good art, and i enjoyed it alone ,2000won for adult entrance. hope more people can enjoy it. if you know art, then should visit here.Really good calligraphy art so, please don`t miss this place."
Symbol of Gwang-ju,It is well known in the gwang-ju. The top of the mountain which is published once a year the scenery is very good. It is possible to move to a city bus in gawng-ju.
A beautiful place to be,"The national park is the main attraction of the city as it has pure natural beauty only increased due to human interference in the area. The place is huge and thus time should be carefully managed and to enjoy it fully, whole day would not be much to stay there. Water and comfortable shoes are a must. "
Beautiful Nature Experience,"You will find everything out there: mountains, forests, waterfalls, old temples, paths for easy walking and cliffs to climb on. Easy to reach from city centre, bus operates till late evening, up to 10PM. The very spirit and nature you remember from movies about the ancient Asia is there. Absolutely must visit."
Lose yourself without getting lost,It's difficult to get lost in Mudeungsan. You'd need to ignore all the sign posts and divert off a hiking path blindfolded. The park is well signed with English and Korean checkpoints. I picked up a map at the entrance to the park and made my way around the park with ease.
"great hike, awesome views",went for a hike alone; avoid the weekends if you're not a fan of crowds. there are several trails and the distances to reach the destinations are written on signs and boards all over the park. it's a great change of environment; away from the busy traffic and malls. a great place for pictures too!
Beautiful Park,"We didn't hike far in the Medeungsan National Park but we were still awed by the beauty of the area. Even the drive up to the trail head was an experience. The only downside was the number of other people, though I have a feeling there are other, more secluded, areas of the park."
One of the best things about Gwangju,"Whenever I have a visitor, I always recommend a hike in Mudeung mountain. There are many routes to fit everybody's level. There are some crowded parts, but also some really quiet secret spots. It's an oasis to escape from the bustling city. After a hike, a meal at the vegetarian buffet Sujata is highly recommended!"
Shopping heaven for outdoor enthusiasts,"Excellent place to visit. There are many trails that are easy to follow with different levels of hardships. So, you can choose to your liking. However, there are so much temptations as there are many outlets for branded goods - columbia, lafuma, millet, northface, plus many others - selling clothing, camping gadgets, boots etc. manage your time, haha....The park is beautiful, and there are many hikers. No wonder we hardly find any obese individuals in Gwangju. All in all, I plan to come back."
hike!,"hiked through this area for about 5 or 6 hrs and it was really nice,good views at the top,some really steep parts but was good exercise and well worth it"
Hiking and Climbing,"Adjacent to Gwangju, pleasant weekends can be crowded along the trails, and even mid-week, you're unlikely to have the place to yourself. . . but this is Korea! (If you drive all away around to the backside, it's a little quieter and more secluded!) There are numerous well-signed trails, temples and eateries. . . Saeinbong is the main area for technical rock-climbing. There aren't many beginner routes, but it's possible to set topropes and even belay from the top."
Great views and walking paths,"There are long walking paths to different peaks of the area. People you meet in the area are extremely friendly and there are also some historical buildings to visit. Visited here during spring time and it was a bit hot even at that time, on the other hand, near mountains peaks, it can be a bit cold and some clouds in the air so better to prepare with some proper clothes. "
Now a national park!,"This year Mudeung Mountain has become a national park of Korea. That means new signage, more buses and more people on the trails. You can see temples along the way too."
What a hike! Amazing views!,"Took the harder trail to the Seoseokdae summit (the highest climbable summit) from where the city bus drops you off. We had a great hike where we discovered a couple waterfalls, a gorgeous view at the summit and a scenic walk down littered with temples, if you still have the energy to see them. Lots of shade on this trail until you hit the summit. A bit challenging from the halfway point to the summit on the way up, but that doesn't matter once you see the view. I highly recommend seeing this.Just a few tips: 1. Bring a lot of water (you can refill in a few places on the trail, but they are few and far between) and some snacks. This trail took us about 3 hrs to reach the summit.2. The park rangers can provide you with a map, if you ask, and are really helpful at giving directions, in English.3. Hiking shoes are a must (I did it in a cheap pair of sneakers and wouldn't want to do it again).4. This mountain is a lot larger than you think. Don't expect to do everything in one trip.5. It may be helpful to learn to read a bit of Hangul before visiting or bring along someone who can read it. Makes way finding so much easier."
just like in any other mountain in Korea...beware of the ajummas,"For you who are too lazy to actually climb, you can take the cable car to the top. Or to somewhere almost near the top. There are of course small shops up there where you can enjoy makkoli (or soju if you really wanna get wasted on a mountain) and pachon. When I went there, as expected, there were some ajummas (old lady) and ajussis (old man) also eating at the same restaurant. They busy talked about our small group of foreigners, which was kinda annoying since we actually speak korean and we could understand what they were saying (nothing good, if you need to know). The cable ride was fun though, there is an old cable car station a little bit higher than the new station. It's totally abandoned and fun to take photos at, but be careful with the rotten floor. Take note to make sure you have a ride going back downtown beforehand, either check the bus schedule or rent a car. The bus rarely passes by the mountain side where the cable car is."
WONDERFUL!,"There is so much to do on this mountain. There are scenic spots and temples, with a lots of eateries by the river at the bottom (by the Jeungsimsa Temple entrance)."
Korean's love to hike!,"I can not believe how many people go hiking especially on the weekends in Korea. Of Course all the temple art atop of these beautiful mountains. bring your own gear, it is expensive in Korea."
Great mountain for serious and casual hikers,"Mudeungsan stands guardian to the city of Gwangju and is a great day out for hikers of all levels. To the east of the city it can be reached by bus from several locations but it is easiest to catch one of several that run from outside the YMCA downtown (ask any local and they can point you in the right direction). Any bus that terminates at Jeungsimsa Temple (it will be in english at the bus stop) will take you to the food of the mountain but the 1187 bus will take you to an alternative start point which I personally prefer (all the buses run back to downtown).At the Jeungsimsa side there is an area full of hiking shops and cafes and several temples as you wind up from the foot of the mountain, there is even an art gallery although I have never ventured inside. Shorter hikes can give you great views of the city and fantastic scenery but you can also go over the top (not the peak however as there is a military base there) and back down in an afternoon or even go further afield if you like getting lost in nature. The trails are well maintained (over maintained in places) and usually crowded on the Jeungsimsa side. Beware there will be snow in the winter and you will need plenty of water in the summer. All in all its a great afternoon if you like to hike and well worth a visit even if you dont."
