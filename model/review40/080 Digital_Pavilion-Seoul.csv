Glass & imagination ,The variation in architecture alone is worth the visit. Lots of great sites. Make time. Open your eyes ... Korea does some things in a special way ...
very interesting for kids,"not so much to do for the adults, but the kids will have some fun there. its a small place, so it wouldnt take up much of your time. "
"Very interesting, fabulous for children","Decided to check this out as it had all this stuff written about it. Get a brochure and check if this is your thing before you go as it is quite a distance from Seoul. We made the trip on a weekday and there was hardly anyone there, we can proudly say we were the only adults without kids! We went straight to the floor but you actually have to register first at the reception at the entrance.There were a few interesting stuff, one that measures your body (everything) except then the results and advice were in Korean. In fact everything is in Korean so luckily for us it was not busy and we just fiddled with everything there. We particularly loved the painting of a digital mural, the robots dancing to Gangnam style, etcIf you decide to visit the MBC studio in this area, it maybe worth your while if you enjoy tech stuff to visit this place."
