Common people's street to drink after work,"This is a food stall & pub street in Jongno-3-ga. People have got together here to get cheap foods & drinks since a long ago. Feel the amazing atmosphere of average people.- The location is near Jongno-3-ga Station Line #5(purple).- For foreign tourists, they have to embrace some hygiene problem. It's not clean enough mostly. A language, too. They are not foreigner friendly.- Instead, they are affordable and good for the price."
