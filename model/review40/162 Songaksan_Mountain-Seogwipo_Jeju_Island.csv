Short Walking Trail,Visited on 17th October 2019.If you going with friend it would be great.A relax mini hiking walk along the breezy turquoise sea.It's a must go. Nice place to take photo too.
One of the less touristy short hikes in Jeju,"Mostly domestic tourists here. This hour-long hike offers both idyllic and dramatic views of the Songaksan volcanic craters and the open ocean. Walk on right till the end to make a complete loop journey, so that you won't miss the breathtaking, almost vertical volcanic crater wall rising up over the sea. "
Relaxing and Lovely Hike,We hiked round the coastal route of the mountain in April and took an hour and a half to compete the hike which included stopping at various viewpoints to enjoy the beautiful coastal scenery and sunset. Weather was good. We started at about 4pm and the place was peaceful with not many people. We also flew a drone at one of the viewpoints. The hiking path was well constructed and easy to walk. You can also ride a horse there.
Great Place with a touch of History,"One can go for a hike or just sit near the shore and enjoy the view. Along the coastline one can see a number of manmade caves which stands as a testimony to the importance of Jeju Island during WWII. These caves built by the Japanese troops served as a place for storing the weapons.Though called as a mountain, it is more like a hill as it is not steep and one can enjoy the walk up the peak."
"An underrated area, visit here if the weather is good","That means during a sunny day, you can see as far as the Halla mountain. And also the various geological formations around the sea. A nice hike which will take about 1.5 hours but you can just take a walk. By the way, the area is often used as backdrop for TV shows including the Dae Jang-geum 大長今 popular drama show."
Easy hike,My husband and I are in our 60's and the hike was fairly easy. The views were amazing. You can buy frozen water at the top and it will provide you with water for hours. We tried octopus or abalone samples. Meh!
"Nice hike, great views, not too crowded","Songaksan was one of the places that had actually a very small crowd of tourists so it make the hike a bit more enjoyable. At the foot of the mountain is a large parking lot with some coffee shops and restaurants, from there it is a light hike up the mountain. Lots of greenery and nice views along the way. The center which I believe is a crate is closed right now, I think for recovery from too many tourists. it is still a good destination to visit, the hike is easy and relaxing, peaceful and enjoyable."
Windy climb with a nice view!,"Songaksan offers an easy 3km walk around it's perimeter, most of which is along its cliff (facing the waters). There is no entrance fee. Prepare yourself with a windbreaker, sunglasses and some water. Very nice view along the way! You can see Sangbasan and Yongmeori Coast from certain angles. You can also see geographical strata on its cliffs. In the month of June, which is near summer, Hydrangeas are in full bloom, adding even more colors to the already beautiful landscape!"
An ideal place for a light trekking about an hour,"It is a place to visit if you visit Jeju Island. In particular, we recommend trekking around Songak Mountain. You will be able to enjoy the stunning scenery and strolls while gazing at the southernmost island of Mara Island in Korea. Trekking courses and benches for relaxation are well maintained and can be walked with men and women, seniors and children because they are not difficult. You may meet horses grazing."
Spectacular great views,"Nice hiking and walk for the great views. We managed to complete the hiking route round the mountain in about 2 hours.Also a good idea is to stop and walk slightly before the mountain as there are also nice scenery of the beach and sea.Beware that the buses out of the area are very irregular and it would be good to start the hike early in the morning and leave before noon as the buses seem to run more regularly early in the morning.We waited an hour for the bus out and gave up, walking to the next town to get a cab. "
lovely place,"place is quite huge,can spend an entire afternoon there. they even have a mini theme park with a pirate ship. you may hike up the trail or visit the temples as well. "
Nice scenery,it's very windy there. didn't get to finish the whole trail as it's too cold and windy. but still nice place to visit
Beautiful View,One of the most memorable places during my visit to Jeju is Songaksan. Only a slight hike up and you'll get the best coastal view. The hike is so gradual that everybody can do it. The view from the top is so pretty and great for taking photos. One of the best time to go is during sunset.Will definitely recommend to everybody who visits Jeju.
One of my favourite place in Jeju,I love this place so much because it is good for photo taking and it is not tiring to walk about unlike some other places which you need to climb a lot in order to take nice photos. Would recommend this place if you like nature and photo taking.
Lovely place,"The place is good for picture taking but can be a good climb for people who are not very active. Great view from atop while you can experience Jeju women divers if you go to the shore. Many restaurants in the area as well for those who want to taste fresh seafood like abalones, shrimp, crabs, squid, shells etc."
The best place,We really enjoyed visiting this place! I recommend you to bring your car with you. but any way you will enjoy there
Cave with Buddha altar!,"We highly enjoyed visiting the Songaksan and its temples, especially the one within a cave after climbing some stairs up!"
"Lovely hike, well-paved trail and beautiful sights","It takes 45-60 minutes to hike around the whole trail. The trail is diverse in the scenes that it presents along different coastal views. Brace yourself for high wind speeds during the colder months. There are a lot of inclines/declines on the trail so be wary of that on the way. There are a couple of restaurants/eateries spotted along mid-trail but I have no comment on those establishments. Before the trail officially begins there is a little rest-stop with coffee shops, convenience stores, and restrooms so I would recommend using the facilities before you embark on your hike. "
Nice view,"The hike is normal, suitable to old people and kids. The view from above is beautiful. You can learn about history as well. "
Lovely scenery~,"We visited Songaksan on an extremely windy day... The winds were so strong, we felt like we were gonna get blown away any second! The scenery is beautiful, and there are no crowds. Serene and peaceful."
"NIce walk around, and excellent scenery","There is a easy trail around there, takes about an hour and you can enjoy lovely scenery of cliffs and sea, watch the yellow submarine dive (different times of day). There is a seafood place serving sashimi along the trail too. Plenty of photo opp."
Beautiful scenery. Lush green,The view is amazing. And the green is calming and lush. A lot of good photo spots. There are restaurants and some street food in the area.
Very nice - nature lovers!,We enjoyed a lot while tracking to Songarksan Mountain. We spend 3 hrs there to get relax. Very very nice place for nature lovers. Must go !!!
One of our favourite local ambles,"This is one of my wife's favourite walks. A lovely, circular amble around the Songaksan peninsula, mostly on boardwalks and steps. Lovely views of the unique geology of the cliffs. Can see pheasants, cormorants, peregrine falcons and occasionally dolphins if you're lucky. You can walk up to the summit which affords stunning views back to Sangbansan and Hallasan (clear day required). If you are that way inclined, there's a Starbucks at the start/finish too."
commands one of the best views in Jeju Island,"I bumped into this place totally by chance. After we had lunch at Daejung, I took beach road to see the sea and when the car has just got over a hill, voila! an overwhelming spectacle captured my eyes.I could see Halla Mountain in remote, Sanbang Mountain girded with cliffs, picturesque islands floating in the crystal sea all in one view.Songak Mountain, which is one of small volcanoes called Orums, itself is also merits seeing around. Trail around it isn't hard to walk along and worth being taken"
Small hils but beautiful view,This small mountain has amazing view from the on top of mountain. When it is clear you can see the island of south in Korea.
Path to Crater Closed,"The south western end of Jeju. The route to the crater look out is closed. From the google translation of the signage, it seems a proper new path will be built.If you want to walk around the whole area, please reserve 1-2 hours."
excellent view,we could not go to the top due to falling rocks on the road. the road was closed due to wind and rain but its beautiful to see the mountain even from the foot hill..its nice place to visit
"To me, it's absolutely worth visiting :D","There's actually nothing much here at Mt. Songak (松岳山) but i really enjoyed this place hahaha If you enjoy Seongsan Ilchulbong Sunrise Peak, you will like this place too. It's less crowded (not so touristy) but not as pretty as Seongsan Ilchulbong Sunrise Peak in my opinion.Full review: http://wanderer.summeree.com/travel/korea/jeju/mt-songak/"
Alternative to Seongsan llchulbong,This is much more friendlier that Seongsan llchulbong. Not too touristy too as most are local visitor. 
Nice to get some fresh air,"One of the nice places to get fresh air from the ocean. Anyway, I don't see how this mountain is different from the others. You can get fresh air from the edge of the island anyway."
nice hike,nice hike up the mountain and great views. check out the WW II history close by - man made caves and bunkers byu the Japanese to store planes
Dead volcano,The volcano is quite scenic. The track on top a little bit steep. Great Korean seafood restaurant nearby - loved it!
"Lovely mountain, great hike.","We didn't seek to visit Mt. Songak -- our driver just brought us there. Not knowing what to do, and since he didn’t speak a word of English we just consulted a map near the entrance and decided that the only thing to do there really was walk up to the crater. It's a genuine natural wonder. I’m glad we went there because the place was just so beautiful it was worth the effort of climbing. And believe me, there was some effort. Unlike other Jeju-do mountains, there were rough parts in this mountain without steps or any pavement. Some bits were steep, too. If you have mobility issues, forget the crater; just walk around. One Korean grandpa lost his footing and scraped his hand on the rocks – we felt bad for him.There were horses that you can ride briefly for a little bit of money. They were cute and surrounded by fields of flowers. It was like a dream to be there, looking at the sky, the sea, the fields and the horses. Would come back if I have the chance."
Fresh Clean Air and Spectacular View,"We drove down here on our way around the Island and I'm glad we did.It was a Spectacular view with a Deep Blue Ocean and clean, fresh air.It was only a short hike to the top, but worth every minute of it"
Awesome,"Awesome scenery. You must try to trek round it, if possible. Its nearby Mt Sambang, so you can cover both consecutively. The coastline is simply beautiful. Take lots of pictures."
When the mountain meet the sea.,"I just love the view in Jeju, that I could see a mountain stand next to the sea. Songak-san is really green, you could feel refreshed while hiking to the top of it. The hiking trail was covered so that you wouldn't slip. The hike won't take that long, about half an hour to the top, and then you could enjoy the view above, like the island which was the very southern part of South Korea."
Beautiful Views,"We love this place. Beautiful views all year round. Clearly marked trails, a submarine to watch, dramatic rock cliffs and horses to ride."
Beautiful Mt. Songak! !,"Mt. Songak is not high. So, climb can children with family. And has beautiful landscape. You can see the Mt.halla & Mt.Songak, seaside with clean weather."
