Damn Good for foreigners. Go and Experience Korean public bath culture.,"Individually im not interesting taking hot bath(tup) in summer.But !If you are feeling Cold? Don't ask. Just Go.And then when you finish bath, Go first korean restaurant (temporary building or nomal anywhere)and then order this""Makgeoly (traditional alcohole), Tofu-(dooroochygi or kimchi).there are local specialties.If you come there in often~winter, try this fruit 'Gaam-Í∞ê(persimmon)'"
