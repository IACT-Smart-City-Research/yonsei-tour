Jinhae Dream Park,"This us for those who do not mind exercise while enjoying beautiful scenery. There are different walkways up the mountain and over the water, a museum and a small shop etc. Try to go on a fall day so you don't overheat."
Jinhae Dream Park,"If you are looking for healing time to yourself. I think you will enjoy the surrounding here at Jinhae Dream Park. It is located in Jinhae-gu, Changwon. Enjoy~ "
"jInhae dream road, so pretty",People say that taking a short stroll through this road will bring you an automatic illusion that you're dreaming. Pale-pink blossoms fluttering up the way~ thats how it got its name. It is located in Jang-bok Mountain on the way up the Ahn Min Hill. The entrance to this way will be to your right.
Interesting wood museum and outdoor space,"We took a taxi to this site. It is on the side of a hill and the walks were well laid out on wooden walkways. The view to Jinhae and the harbor area were good and on a clear day it would have been great as one should be able to see quite far. There were a number of pagoda type rest places so a picnic and a rest in the shade may have been fun. There was a small pond with fish and ducks which made the experience nicer. The Wood Museum part was interesting but very little signage in English, but I think we got the general idea. There were some fossilised trees and also wood carvings. a small play area for children where there were wooden block puzzles and books to read. There is a small cafe as well as a cool drink dispenser. To get back we walked down the hill and then took a bus to where we stayed. I don't think any bus will go all the way to the site - it is incredibly steep. There is parking if you go by car.We decided that on a cooler day it would be wonderful to enjoy a hike in the forest area on the hills. There seemed to be hiking paths."
