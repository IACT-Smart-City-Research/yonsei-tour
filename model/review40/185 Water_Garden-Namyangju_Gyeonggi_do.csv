Go for a walk and relax.,All about nature and serene. Ride bicycle from Paldang station along side the Bukhan river and you will see so much nature. 
Good walking course with beautiful garden and river view.,"C1 ( 2016.10.07 ) ""Garden of Water"" was very good walking course beside river. There was walking road and big cosmos garden. I walked alone about 30 minutes, that's very good with smell of flower and river view. Maybe there was planted another flower by season. I think. I were satisfied this area for walking."
