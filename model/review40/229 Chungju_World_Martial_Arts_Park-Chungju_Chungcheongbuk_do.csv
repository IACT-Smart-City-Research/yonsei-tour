Great for that lovely quiet Saturday afternoon,"The park is great for the whole family. There was a martial arts museum introducing visitors to the art of Taekkyon, a lesser known martial art in Korea as well as many playgrounds for kids. Since I went during winter, there was also an outdoor skating rink and a sledding hill. There is also a bike lane that takes riders from Chungju all the way to Seoul (it is about 131 km...). It was very peaceful and an ideal place to spend a quiet Saturday afternoon. FYI: the museum is also free and it has an observation deck on the top floor."
Wonderful park,"The Chungju World Martial Art Park is located in the outskirts of Chungju.This is a large area with nice garden, bike-riding enabled area and trail along the river and of-course - lot of places to walk and see.Also you can find, on the adjacent hill, a beautiful temple and memorial site with river scenic view.Also in the compound is the World Martial Art Museum.The parking lot is spacious and free."
