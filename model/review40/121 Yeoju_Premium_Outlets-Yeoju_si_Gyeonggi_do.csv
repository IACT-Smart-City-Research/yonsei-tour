"Decent, but...","A nice outlet mall locate about 2hours away from seoul. However while the place has wide variety of stores, prices are just ""ok"" with not much one can really call a bargain. Families traveling with baby strollers might have a hard time as the place is divided into various levels. I'm sure they have elevators, but they don't appear to be conveniently located. I suggest booking a private van to go to and from the place as going back to the city as it is quite a challenging commute via public transportation."
big outlet comparable to the European ones,"Prices are good and can get real bargain if you search hard. Not many local brands though, so it is different from the others Korean outlet we been. Transport could be difficult and bus drivers not the most helpful ones"
Outlet outside a city!!,"This outlet located outside a city. There provides many brands. I think 2 hrs is not enough for shopping. Price is ok for some brands, Some brands are expensive too. there has 2 shops of Starbucks coffee. I think the kios shops price are expensive. "
Nothing extraordinary ,"If you’ve been to premium outlets in Europe, then I would not recommend you to go to this place. Items were similar to the ones in Europe but the price is slightly higher for outlet price. But still cheaper compare to prices in the boutiques in Seoul. The place is quite far from Seoul if using public transport. The place is huge but still a nice place to go if you have more time in south Korea. But this is going to be my first and the last. "
Watch out for great bargains ,It’s a huge space with plenty of brands. Mostly international known brands so it can still be pricey even with discount and not as cheap as in Europe or US outlets . But great bargains can be found usually in some sale racks with 90% Off or flat prices for the whole bin . Make sure to allocate 2 to 3 hours at least. Not sure about the food options but I saw some kebabs and we snacked on some ice cream and had coffee in Starbucks . 
All brands with limited options ,"I think you can find all brands but still the options are limited except for some brands such as Polo, Addidas... It has limited restaurants especially if you are not fan of Korean foods "
Big Premium Outlet,Love it so much but unfortunately our tour guide only gave us an hour to explore..We need a half day at least to explore this area
You won't miss anything much!,"If you have been to other Premium outlets in US, you either have to manage your expectation or just not go. Prices not that cheap and range for shopping is very limited. Most shops are quite small and some service staff appeared bored and disinterested to serve. Not worth the travelling time of almost 2hrs and 5700won (one-way bus ticket from Seoul Express Bus Terminal). Save your time & money for shopping in myeongdong or Doota. Also, since the instruction to get there is not very clear. I will attempt to provide some info: 1. Go to the Seoul Express Bus Terminal2. Buy the ticket to Yeoju Premium Outlet from the counter 3. Journey is supposed to be about 1hr 40mins4. Alight at the last stop Yeoju and take a taxi (11,000won) to the Outlet. (There are buses but apparently it takes a long time and we wasn't sure where is the bus stop. See photo instruction we took at the bus terminal)"
