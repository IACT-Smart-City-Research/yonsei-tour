Good exhibitions,"Different rooms show history, buddhism sculpture, crafts and art, calligraphic painting rooms. Great information about the making wood bocks."
Could be better,"The small museum, empty on the day of our visit, costs W 20 000 pp (an extra charge above the cost of entering the area in general).It gives some explanation to the woodcut plates, in English too, but I was left wanting more than the museum could offer."
Beautiful location too crowded,"Overall this place was beautiful especially in the fall, and late summer. HOWEVER, that is also when throngs of people descend onto this area, long lines of cars, a lack of decent accommodation that's reasonably priced is also an issue. Negatives:No dogs allowed(during peak seasons) its a headache trying to deal with the entrance people who say dogs are okay, and then once you are past the gates, you have to deal with the National Park rangers and they (at least in the fall) got their panties in a bunch about the dog.-traffic-lack of decent accommodations (if you book ahead there are some decent places)"
Could be done a little better,"Anything pertaining to Haeinsa and Tripitaka Koreana should be spectacular, exposed, explained and proudly displayed. The museum is lacking in many attention drawing features. It is also not advertised properly. The reality is that everything should be in English language besides Korean otherwise the international tourists have difficulties appreciating the information offered."
Missed opportunity to disclose the Tripitaka Koreana to the public,"N35°47.618' E128°05.678' Haeinsa temple is famous for its Tripitaka Koreana, on the UNESCO world heritage list, and the buildings storing it can be seen behind the last Haeinsa temple. Seeing because entering it is forbidden. From the outside, the wooden blocks are slightly visible through the vertical wooden rungs of the buildings. The Haeinsa Seongbo museum, the first big building on the path leading up to the main temple entrance, does not step into this void. Although some blocks in this wooden block-printing museum are on display and the process of creating these blocks is illustrated during our visit in August 2014, the museum is very non-interactive in displaying its content. Several video screens were not functioning and some displays lacked English translation. Only one of the three floors was is use. Notice the Haeinsa temple scale model; build from Lego plastic toy bricks.For preservation, the real wooden blocks are hidden for the public, but the Haeinsa Seongbo Museum does not disclose in a compelling way what is in the buildings that house them. Missed opportunity."
