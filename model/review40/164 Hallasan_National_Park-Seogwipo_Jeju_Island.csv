Great hiking experience!,"Up & down of the mountain took us 9.5 hours including some short rest time during the hike. We started the hike around 9am (recommend to start early, we were late), and came down around 6:30pm. Our legs were like jelly legs after the hike, but is worth the hike. You can see nice view along the journey. Please do not forget to greet everyone you met with ""anyeonghaseyo"", they are all very friendly people. Wear a pair of good hiking shoes, bring some snacks with you and also water. The stalls along the mountain are closed during our hike, luckily we have prepared enough snacks and water. The view at the peak is breathless. A lots of old korean aunties and uncles also managed to reach the peak, so I guess we all younger than them have no excuses of not fit to hike, right? haha...Wear sport attire, although some said it will be freezing cold at the peak (about 1950 meters height), but believe me, you wont feel cold as you have already all sweat during the hike. We spent about 30mins to 1 hour at the peak taking photos, resting and having our snacks before going down again. A pair of good hiking shoes is important so that you won't get blister on your feet. We will go back again in different season if we have the chance. We were travelling there in Oct 2018."
Hallasan fall leaves,"We went to Hallasan NP in early November by ourselves. It’s quite easy to take the bus to the park. Just make sure you know which stop to get off as there are several entrances. We decided to hike the shortest trail (1.3km). It begins at the Hallasan National Park Visitor Centre and finishes atop Eoseungtaeng Oreum, with sweeping views of the Jeju plains and the peak of Hallasan. The leaves are very beautiful along the trail. With our age, being seniors, and photo stops, it took us one hour to get up to the top. Definitely it worths the hike!"
Winter Wonderland,"Our visit was postponed for a day but it was worth the wait. There was a heavy snowstorm a couple of days prior and the roads to Hallasan National Park were closed. When access to the park was restored, a beautiful blanket of snow was awaiting.It was my first experience of snow and I loved it. I came from a tropical country (where the coldest temperature ever recorded was at 6 degrees Celsius) so experiencing snow is a surreal experience. Although we did not climb any trail to the summit, experiencing snow even just outside the Visitor Center was fun and pleasurable. The Jeju Snow Festival for 2018-2019 did not include the Visitor Center at Hallasan National Park, however, unlike the previous year so there were no attractions set up in the area.Because of this, I am going back to South Korea this coming December for another winter wonderland experience and to try out skiing."
I’d never forget this ,"An UNESCO Biosphere Reserve and a World Heritage Site, the Hallasan National Park is loaded with walking trails and is home to South Korea’s highest mountain named the Shield Volcano Hallasan. You’ll find about 1800 different kinds of plants and a number of alpine animals along the way up. The park is a unique place for nature lovers. Settled right in the heart of Jeju island, this park with high density woods and blooming hillsides is concidered as a treat to be at. Transportation: start with chosing a right trail for you. There many different ways up to the mountain, but only one of them will bring you to the summit. To get to the entrance you’d probably need to take one of the public busses or rent a car. Both options are convenient. Equipment: You’d definitely need to be prepared for a long and tiring walk. All the trails are devided into segments, based on their difficulty. Some of the parts of the trail would be paved, some wouldn’t be equipped at all. You’d be grateful for those parts where you’d be able to walk and step on the wooden bridges and paths. But except those short and the easiest parts of the way, you’d need to climb on the steep and narrow rocks, hop along cobblestones and boulders. Timing: don’t rush, remember when you’re on the top, that was only a half of your journey. There is the same long way down the mountain when you’re on the summit. Tips: be prepared for considerable change of the temperature and other weather conditions. We started in a pleasant sunny day and finished when it was drizzling and the fog was literally embracing us. Add up some wind and decreased temperature and you’re almost in our shoes out there. You’d definetely need to wear tracking boots or something alike, protecting and supporting your feet well. Otherwise you risk hurting your ankles and knees. (as us, cause we were not prepared)You’d also want to change your clothes after 6-7 hours tracking up and down this mountain. Believe me you’ll be sweating af."
A Jeju Must Go,"If there is only one thing I can do during my travel in Jeju, it would be hiking at the Hallasan National Park. There were just 2 trails (Seongpanak & Gwaneumsa, where Seongpanak was easier) which can reach the top of the mountain, where you can see the Baengnokdam. You can even get a certificate (which costs only KRW1000) of climbing the Hallasan if you show the staff at the tourist centre your picture with Baengnokdam."
Trek n hike,"A difficult one if you choose to do the longest one which takes 4.5 hrs up and 4 hrs down.We went up the Eorimok trail which took us 2 n half hours up..its not an easy trak with steps and rocky path but the track has been laid with a lot of effort.In autumn the trees start to turn their colours .We came down the yeongsil trail which took us one hour to come down with spectac views..its an easier way to climb down than to climb up the yongsil trail.Bus 240 goes and come back at both stops with the entrance name as the stop names.But while from Eiromok entrance it's just a 10 mins walk up to the start of the trail.....its 45 mins walk to walk to the yeongsil entrance bus stop to the start of the trail.There are no tkts entrance for the hikes,but if you have rented a car then there is a parking fees.Carry some food to eat and energy bars and water n juice."
Great nature walk,We took one walk here. Vertical rise of about 200m through nature. A couple of hours of hiking & stopping to view the plants & birds. Great view of the crater from the top. Worth the trek. Carry lots of water if it hot!
Refreshing,"There are several trials to explore and because of time limitation, have chosen the shortest one and the hike of 2.5 hours is rewarding. Air is fresh and can image the autumn maple leaves will be wonderful."
Enjoyed the hike and the views that came with it,"I took the eorimok trail which took about 2.5 hours to get to the top with the rest rooms, the first part of the trek is hard work and quite strenuous. After reaching the top I took the yeongsil trail back down which had some of the most stunning views along the way. As I came by bus the walk down from the yeongsil trail to the yeongsil ticket office where the bus stop is located takes another 40minuts or so depending on the pace. I Would highly recommend visiting this area and trying the trails. "
Great hike,Took the longest trail to Mount Hallasan peak (Seongpanak Trail) - 9.6 km - but started a bit late and did not make the cut-off time at the Jindalrae shelter (7km). However it was a great walk and I visited the Saraoream peak on a side tril on the way back. This was well worth it as there is great view and also a beautiful crater lake. It is key that you start early and take enough water with you. Also need good shoes. Although it was August - most of the trail is in the forest - so not so hot.
nice hiking experience,"choose to get up by soegpanak trail and down by another trail， Gwaneumsa, which much more harder and shorter. Manage to complete the hiking for 7 hours"
The highest mountain in South Korea.,"I took bus 281 from Jeju Intercity Bus Terminal at 6.24am and get off at Seongpanak stop. Start hiking at 7.30am. It took me about 4 hours to reach the top. It was hot at top. I brought 1 liter of water and some buns and it was okay for me.I walked down the Gwaneumsa Trail. It took another 4 hours. If you want to go back to Jeju Intercity bus terminal take bus 475 from Gwaneumsa to Shancheondan Altar and switch to bus 281 to the Jeju Intercity bus Terminal.Every bus fare is 1,200 won."
Not for the weakhearted,"I decided to hike the Yeongsil trail to Mount Hallasan, since it was the shortest of all the trails. It was estimated to take roughly 2 hours and that it did. I gotta say this hike is one of the more vigorous hikes I have done and requires a very good pair of hiking shoes! The views as you ascend only get better and put you in awe. Once you reach the top there is a rest area with toilets and an area to rest. I suggest for those that plan to do this bring a snack and drink so you can enjoy the views once you get to the top."
Prep yourself well if you decided to take the trail to the summit,"Took the Seonpanak trail, one of the 2 only trails that will lead to the summit. It is a longer route compared to the other but was supposely less challenging. Well, still a very tough hike to me. Much of the path and climbs are big rocks so good hiking shoes and walking stick will be very helpful. No water along the way though one sign mentioned there is one, which was WRONG and not updated. My son believed in that signboard and finsihed his water way before half into the hike. Big mistake!Not much to see along the way, except if you take a detour to view sara oreum. Took about 3.5hrs to reach Jindalrae office/ shelter (which is 1500m high) and after much thought, decided to turn back due to lack of drinking water.Descending is much tougher for me and took longer time. Deers and boars were spotted.Do go early so that you do not have to park too far from the park entrance as the carpark gets filled up fast and you will need to park along the roadside. Go during weekdays if possible to avoid the crowds.Take note there is time limit to reach Jindalrae so that you can continue to the summit."
Such an achievement!,"Scaled the heights of Hallasan ! Took the Seongpanak trail and us a good 8-9 hours both ways. The trail started with easy ( which I personally do not think is really so), normal, then difficult pathways. Stamina is important, perserverance is a must! The toughest is the rocky incline just before the summit.There are ropes to aid the climbing, and they are just so needed! View is stunning way up the trail. At summit, every hikers were just simply waiting to take pics with the ""rock"". Felt totally drained and seriously exhausted when finally reached the base, but it is all so worth it! An astounding acheivement to remember for life :)"
A Must Visit Place in Jeju,"Good driving views. You will be blown away. Should visit this place in the morning before 9am to avoid the crowd especially during weekend. There are so many trails. Please ensure you know which trail you are taking as the mountain is so huge. Must wear proper trekking clothes and shoes. If you are driving, please ensure you go down the same way as you climb up or else, you need to get a cab to bring you back to your car. Bring water, snacks and plastic bag to throw your rubbish. You must bring down your rubbish with you."
Excellent trail,"If you visit Jeju island, you should go for a trail in Hallasan mountain. I did the Eorimok-Nambyeokbungijeom trail from Eorimok visitor center. Approx. 6 hours two ways hiking - 14 km. "
Many trails; interesting national park,We came by using GPS to guide us to the National Park. We entered the part called the Healing Forest. Interesting plants on healing the body. Several small huts/cabins are available for those who may like to stay in the forest for healing and relaxation. Do go into the forest for a real feel of the national park. Entrance is free. 
Rocky mountain,"I decided to go with Seongnapak trail, and was planning to go up to the summit!Rocky and stony path made me really exhausted, I managed my breath okay and left the last 1.5km as my keens!You will be accompanied by many people along the trail! It’s highly recommended to start early, I arrived by 8am, reached the shelter around 11:00am!Weather was mild as you’ll be covered by trees most of the time! "
Fantastic and easy to do by public transport,"Beautiful hike, I went up the Seongpanak trail and down Gwaneumsa. Hardly anyone around on the way down, was nice and peaceful. Contrary to what some info says online there is a public bus to/from Gwaneumsa during the week - the 475. The column in red of the picture below are the times to depart on this bus from the trail car park."
"Eoseungsaengak Trail, shortest trail","We hiked up the mountain with our kids age 6 & 8. This is the shortest trail in Hallasan National Park (Infor: 1.3 km / 30 min each way/ only 1 trail, you won't get lost). The trail is rather easy to hike and shady all the way to the peak. The path is either with wooden staircase or laid with rubber mat on slippery path. Along the way, you can hear birds chirping. The 360 scenery view at the peak is breathtaking."
"Up by Eorimok, down by Yongsil","As per suggestion of our taxi driver, we decided to climb up along the Eorimok trail as according to him, it was the easier of the two. The first 2km was upwards slope of big rocks stairs so it was a little tiring but after that, the course was breezy. Took us about 2h to the top. The day we went was super windy so it was really really cold and everyone took cover in the shelter at the top, but if the weather permits, you can sit outside and enjoy the view. The climb down by Yongsil trail was really beautiful and it's a very different kind of view than Eorimok. We understood why the driver said Eorimok was easier to climb up as Yongsil had more rocks that would have been a little difficult. I'm not an avid climber but both trails were doable and the views were worth it."
Not difficult hike,The parking is 1000w. Don’t stop right after the entrance keep driving or you’ll end up walking very far. The trail is well marked no chance of getting lost. I got there about 0900 and it wasn’t busy. When I was heading back to the entrance at 1200 it was getting very crowded. The “peak” wasn’t much of a peak. It was a flat staging area with the rock slab marking the elevation. There is a trail that leads off left of the seating area and one behind the rock slab. I followed it about 1 hour before I decided to turn back. I wasn’t sure where the path led and my car was at one end. Beautiful but easy hike. Little to no shade to wear sunscreen or hats. 
Pleasant hike up gwaneumsa trail,"We hiked up the gwaneumsa trail (shorter, steeper but more scenic route). Really glad we chose this route as there was far less people and the views were spectacular.We arrived to the trail head at 7am and paid the 1800 krw fee for parking. The trail head is clearly marked and there's a nice washroom that you can use before beginning the trek. The trail is well marked (there's no way you can get lost) and also well maintained.You reach the first rest stop around 3km into the hike. There's a very smelly washroom there (there's a better one at the next rest stop). You must reach the last rest stop by a certain time or else you won't be able to proceed. The time posted today was 1300 although it looked like the only barrier was a small chain that you could walk around so I'm not sure how enforced that rule actually is. After the final rest stop the trail goes downhill a bit then the steepest climb begins. The stairs don't seem to end for the last 2.7km!! The views are spectacular though. Once we reached the top there was so many people! Where did they all come from? The seonpanak trail. So glad we chose this trail instead.In the end it took us 4.5 to climb to the top of hallasan (with many rest/photo/food breaks) and another 3.5 hours to descend. I had 2L of water although I only drank about 1L. There were many bugs but I didn't seem to get any bites. There doesn't seem to be any dangerous animals out there although there are signs warning about boars. "
Beautiful landscape and a great hike,"My wife and I hiked up Hallasan in early May 2019 and, while the hike was more challenging than we expected, we enjoyed our day on the mountain!"
Yeongsil and eurimok trail,The Yeongsil trail is beautiful. But wouldn't suggest eurimok. Very rocky and didn't see much. Apparently there were supposed to be flowers blooming. It was also very hard coming down.. Better to stick to Yeongsil going up and down. We went up Yeongsil and came down eurimok and took taxi back to Yeongsil pick up the car. 
great climb beautful few,most important points1 start your climb early. as you must reach a certain point before noon and must start the decent by 14:30.2 take a bout 3-4 leters of water per person as there is no place to fill or buy anywhere on the climb (locals take tangerines as they are filled with liquid and sugars)we started at the road 1131 entrance at about 08:30 and reached the midpoint at about 11:30 and then the top at 14:00large parts of the route are wood walks and steps but others are more difficult.when you reach the top make sure to take a picture of the tree with writing as proof so you can get a certificate when you reach the bottom (1000 WON)Enjoy your climb
Nothing's quite as memorable as hiking Hallasan in an 18 day Trip to Korea,"As the title says, hiking Hallasan gives a sense of accomplishment and something to look back fondly upon. I remember reading a fellow TripAdvisor review on how she did not believe she would be able to complete the hike but she eventually did it at the expense of not being able to walk the next day.Here's my advice:- Climbing Hallasan in the winter period would have a better scenery in my opinion. Trekking during the Apr period, the barren trees across the landscape didn't look too impressive. However, looking at Hallasan pictures in winter looked amazing so that's my take on what season to climb.- Climbing gear is recommended like walking sticks for example, they would definitely be useful especially in winter or the day after heavy rain as the ground would be slip-prone.- Remember to get enough water as some have complained about the lack of water refilling stations. We had brought 3 x 2L bottles for 3 people and they were sufficient without any refill. Take note the trail with the water refills will be slightly longer than the trail without. - Best to trek early as there is a cutoff timing to reach a certain place at the trail (12.30 Korea time) - It was quite warm trekking in Apr, just prepare a jacket alongside for the peak- Buy some snacks and food for the peak and the rest stops on the way up. Buying gimbap would be a good idea, don't buy too much though for they may end up being a burden. Also, you will see some of the Koreans pack hot water and cup noodles up to enjoy so that's an option as well.As you trek, you will see plenty of Korean elderly hiking alongside you. If they can do it, you can too. (PS, we took 9.5 hours)"
The Tallest Mountain in South Korea,"It’s our 2nd time in Jeju Island so we decided to do it. We took a bus to Seongpanak and started our hike there. It took us 5 hrs to the peak. It’s not an easy hike at all. Wear comfortable shoes, hiking shoes or sneakers with very good soles. The trail is full of rocks. This will definitely hurt your feet. Don’t wear jeans. Wear something more comfortable. Also bring as much water as you can. In the map, it says there is a Water Station but they are gone now. You have to be by the second shelter at 12:30 or else they wont allow you to go to the summit. Everybody must descend by 2pm.Going down we took the Gwaneumsa Trail which is shorter but more difficult trail. However, I would recommend this trail cause it’s more scenic. It took us another 5 hrs. "
Nice View,"The view from the top is amazing. It was end of winter season, I love the view when snow melting. the weather was cold but the view was so amzing. I rent taxi to go to this place."
Challenging But Satisfying Hike,"We did the Yeongsil trail hike in early April as one of our must do activities in Jeju. Weather was perfect on the day of our hike. It took us about 5 hours (2 ways) at a leisurely pace to complete the hike. We enjoyed the lovely scenery along the way. Most parts of the trail have proper steps but some parts are rocky and the steps are uneven. It is helpful to use hiking sticks for the hike. We drove to the starting point of the trail and started the hike at about 11am. If you are driving, do not park at the car park after the car park payment kiosk. You need to drive another 2 km up the slope to reach the starting point of Yeongsil trail. Although the hike was challenging but we felt a sense of accomplishment after completing the hike."
Wonderful Day Hike,"For people who love nature and the great outdoors especially hiking, this day trip up the highest mountain in South Korea is not to be missed if you are in Jeju. It took us 10 hours ( 5 hrs up, 1 hr at summit and 4 hrs down ). Trails and directions are very clearly marked. Best tip I can give is to go up via Gwaneumsa and back down via Seongpanak. But dress in layers. When we were up there end March, it was a beautiful spring day ( temp about 15C ) but 2 days later, it was about 8C and very windy in the city ( so you can imagine the conditions at the summit if we had climbed later ). A tiring day but no regrets whatsoever."
Challenging and beautiful adventure,"Our family of five climbed Hallasan on the day before Christmas to celebrate our 20th wedding anniversary. This trail is definitely the most challenging one we have ever attempted as a family. My husband carried our three year-old daughter 90% of the way in a toddler backpack. Our boys (11 and 14) are great hikers; I would not recommend attempting this with young children unless they can be carried. The trail system is well maintained, signs are plentiful and communicate exactly where you are and how far you have to go. In the winter it's best to start before dawn so that you can get to the top of the mountain before the time limit. The trail is crowded with hikers. "
Beauty on its own,Hired a car ans drove to Hallasan National park. Did not have time to hike so just enjoy the lovely scenary with a nice weather. 
Must see and experience the walks..,Today I hired a car and drove to Hallasan National Park. Only 1000 won to enter and park.Plenty of clean toilets. An excellent Visitor center who gave me an informative map. I did not have time to do Eorimok Trail today but will do tomorrow.I climbed the Eoseungsaengak Trail which is only 1.3km and has wooden steps all the way up so no problem with any fitness level.30 minutes up to the top. Great 360 deg.view of the surrounding mountains and a small Japanese bunker to see too. Friendly Jackdoor birds wanting a scrap of food..
Gorgeous view and Not too difficult to climb Mt Hallasan,"Went there without much training as I envisage that winter time is more pleasant to climb. We reached the base around 7.30am as we try to take the first bus. As we envisage there are snow, I have a pair of crampons bought before arriving in Jeju. Fortunately I did as the crampon sold at the shop is rather expensive. Then it was a relax 2 hours climb, I did not want to rush, but took time to appreciate the environments and snow. The crampons came in useful as you climb further up, it gets slippery. Good to have walking sticks too. At about the 1000+ meter stop, there is shop where you could buys hot noodles and drinks. I bought another set of crampons there as it is reasonable compared to the shop at the base of the mountain.After a short rest, the final climb to the top. Here there is a series of steps and staircase that leads to the top. At some point it was rather steep so have to climb up slowly, catching my breaths as the higher altitude and cold tends to slow you down. There is a timing to get down from the mountain per regulations, hence the need to get to the top early to enjoy the view and triumph. Finally reaching the top, was rewarded with a gorgeous scenery. It was kind of crowded and there was a queue of climbers taking turns to take picture with the summit monument. After taking lots of pictures, hiking down was relatively easily, reaching the base in half the time. Took the bus back to town to enjoy a beer and fried chickens. A trip not to be missed."
Beautiful views from different sides ,"The mountain is beautiful viewed from any side. We started with the 1100m stop early one morning, there was a light dusting of snow from the previous night so the place really pretty. We spent a short time here, about 20 minutes as the fog started to appear. We then drove to the other sides, nice scenic drive. "
"Highest mountain, but easiest in S. Korea","Did a solo hike in the hot summer of July, and wasn't disappointed.It was a long, easy hike up with some steep steps near the end of the hike. 10KM up and down, in total 20KMThere are some stops along the way, especially the 'base camp' where you can purchase ramen to eat.There are no railings or ropes to hold on to a few metres close to the peak, so this would be harder to do on a winter's day.Was kinda sad that the peak was shrouded by a large cloud, but nonetheless satisfied with the easy hike.Public transport starts as early as 6AM, so if you drive and want to end early, it would be better. "
Hallasan Very good place,Very Nice place also very cold and we have a lot experience at this place..it is the 1st time i n my family go to the best place at jeju
The lucky one,"The day before we visit Mt Hallasan, it rained. Therefore, we had the chance to hike with snow. Very important to have proper gadgets as slipped a few times on the way down...."
A beautiful mountain,"Awesome view.I went to hike from Eorimok.i went there by taxi because the bus from Jeju city to Eorimok only operate on weekend Saturday and Sunday.Due to the winter season and I do not wear specific hiking gear, i only hike halfway.Want to hike Hallasan again next time."
One of the best hiking of my life!!,"I kindly suggest this trail!!! We started the hiking from Gwaneumsa Temple, probably the most challenging trail. The entire trail is organized and you can't choose the wrong street. It is not impossible to reach the top of the mountain but it is better to start early because after 1-2 pm they close the top of the mountain. We started at 8.30 and we reached the top in about 5 hours. Climbing down was more difficult due to the pain of knee and leg muscle but the environment and the mountain were wonderful. I have the dream to repeat the hiking again in another season, possibly easter or summer."
I Think I can...,"This magnificent, iconic destination is well worth the struggle to the top. I'm seriously unfit and overweight but I took it slowly and made it. We saw deer grazing as we returned and it was a peaceful and serene experience"
Something to do just once - just to see if you can,"Climbed Mount Halla as part of a group tour. It was definitely a challenging climb as I would not call myself fit. I did get to the top though and that was after 3 and a half hours of climbing. It's easier at the bottom and tougher towards the top because of the various flights of stairs. Also something to note is that it's very cold on top and requires layers, as well as proper hiking shoes. The view for me wasn't the best but having been able to push my body that far was a reward in itself. People brought food and had picnics at the summit. It was more difficult coming back down as your're moving on uneven ground for long periods of time. Overall glad I did it"
Hiking up and down Eorimok trail,"We had a lovely half hour drive from Jeju city to the trail head of the Eorimok trail. As we neared the mountain, the temperatures dropped and more and more snow could be seen. Roads were clear though and no snow chains were needed.We reached the carpark around 8 am and it was mostly empty (less than 10 cars). It cost us a 1000 won to enter the carpark. The entrance to the Eorimok trail can easily be found by the signage around the carpark.The trail started off easily then there were the stairs. The hardened snow made it harder than it was to climb up and down those stairs. Do remember to wear crampons if you are planning the climb when there’s snow because we only had on our hiking boots and it would have definitely been easier with the crampons.We took a rest and a toilet break at the Witsaeoreum shelter. Do bring your own food and drink as there are no food and water sold at the shelter. There are also no dustbins there so whatever trash you have must be brought back with you.Enjoy the walk and take in all the scenery and fresh air while you’re there and have a great time!"
Great view with caring and helpful park management ,"Suffering from Avascular Necrosis bilateral hip, hiking up the mountain was not only a challenge but also proof of the fact that with perseverance, one can overcome any obstacles... Would recommend people with disabilities to try hiking up Yeongsil trail (thanks to a lovely couple who took us up from the ticket office to the Yeongsil entrance) for the breathtaking views and to hike down Eorimok Trail which is easier with not so much beautiful views...as when we came down it was 6pm, there was no bus and we were stuck.. thanks to Hyun Seung, a caring park management personnel, we were able to head back to our hotel with ease. Hyun Seung not only called for us a taxi, he even waited in the cold with us for our taxi so that we wouldn’t miss it. Overall, our experience at Hallasan was amazing and complete thanks to Hyun Seung!"
Great Experience,Visited Hallasan during Autumn season and the weather was chilly. Best to bring an extra layer of clothing to wear esp when you’re at the top. Did the climb at 9ish in the morning and managed to reach the shelter before the cutoff time at 1230pm (if my memory didn’t fail me). Took about another 2 hours or so before we reached the peak. The trail we took was pretty gentle in the beginning but it was filled with loads of steps at the end. We were rewarded with a great view at the top so the pain of going up & down was definitely worth it. Gotta do it at least once when you’re in Jeju! 
First time hiking in snow,"We visited Hallasan National Park in mid December. We ascended via Gwaneumsa trail (8.7km) up to the peak and descended via the Seongpanak trail (9.6km). Gwaneumsa is shorter but more challenging on the way up, it is easier on the knees. We started at 07:30hr, which is the sunrise time. The initial hike was relatively flat, walking on uneven big rocks. There were signs throughout the trail, indicating where you are, distance and estimated time to the peak. Snow started to appear midway and we had to put on crampons on our boots. We took about 3 hours to reach the shelter and another 1 hour 45 minutes to reach the peak. Unfortunately, the weather was cloudy at the peak with low visibility. It was very windy and cold. We joined the queue to have photos taken at the iconic landmark.We started our descent at 12:45hr, arrived at the shelter at 15:15hr, had a short break before descending the remaining 4.1km. We took about 4 hours for the entire descent, exhausted by then.This is the first time my friend and I hiked in snow during winter. We took longer than expected as we were extra careful and also took many photos. Overall, it was a great first time experience hiking on snow.Tips for winter hiking:1. Start as early as possible so that you are not pressured to reach the shelter before 1200hr.2. Wear comfortable shoes, preferably water resistant or waterproof.3. Be extra careful when stepping on the big rocks during the initial trail. They are uneven and may twist your ankles. 4. Crampons are necessary, while trekking poles are optional.5. Wear layers of clothing so that you can add/remove when necessary.6. Wear beanie hat and neck covering to protect your ears/neck from the cold, especially at the peak.7. Bring your own food, snacks and water/energy drink. There are no food stalls nor toilet at the peak.8.Toilet facilities are only available at the shelters, hence relief yourself before proceeding.Hope you enjoyed the hike."
Trekking but need crampons during winter,"For those who enjoyed being with the nature, this is definitely one of must visit place.You get to see snow at the TOP of the Mountain during winter.However we only managed to climb up to 1.100m and stopped as we did not have crampons else it will be very slippery."
Worth a visit!,UNESCO site . Lovely walks with various trails. Make sure you read up on various trails to decide which trail would suit you best in terms of the amount of time you have and level of difficulty. 
Rental Boots in Hallasan Mountain,Please help....Is there a rental boots/shoes intended for hiking near Hallasan Mountain or Jeju City? Thank you for those who can comment on this...
Yeongsil Trail Hike ,"Easy access by bus 240 from Jeju Intercity bus station (about 45mins). Beautiful wet walk of about 4 hours, fairly tough Hike for us city dwellers as we were not equipped for the hike. Missed the bus stop on our way back and walk 20 mins in the wrong direction. A helpful bus driver stop to give us free lift to the correct bus stop so that we could catch the correct bus back to Jeju. Will be back during Spring or Summer next time to do the other trails."
Hallason ,This is one of the best places to go for hiking in Jeju is land. This is a Unesco world heritage site and leads to the volcano and heighest mountain in Korea
Beautiful and superb steps!,"Well, the place is really amazing! I took the Yeongsil trail as it was said to be an easy trail but I was a bit surprise to see steep steps. Hahah but believe me when I say that the place is amazing! You'll never regret it. The people were amazing too!"
Tiring Climb up the peak,"182meter tall and a tiring climb for some, but the view from the top makes it worth all the calories burnt to get there.. A must go venue! "
Breathtaking place,"Very very nice scenery. Crisp clean air. With the wind blowing on your face, it can be chilling at some time. A good Instagram able place. "
Beautiful in the Winter with snow,"There are several ways of hiking this national park. I went on the Eorimok trail during the winter so hiking boots with crampons are necessary, but I only had hiking boots so I didn't go the top of any peak, but it was still beautiful with all the snow. "
Autumn trek,"This review will be written from the point of view of a middle aged woman of average fitness, not someone for whom a 20 km trek is a walk in the park.Mount Hallasan is the highest peak in South Korea and if you are on Jeju island it's definitely worth visiting. We took the Seongpanak trail, a scenic , easy route which reaches the summit. Plan on one day for the trek up and down. Here are some tips:1. It goes like this - You take a bus or taxi to the Seongpanak trail, and start climbing. It's a mix of some steps and an easy trail. After a while you reach the first stop - I forget the name - where you can use the restroom. There's a small shelter where we had our packed sandwiches. After this, the trail becomes a little steeper, and you reach the next stage - the jindeballat rest stop.( Times by which you must reach the Jindeballat stop and when you must start your descent are posted on the trail). There are restrooms here - but inspie of information to the contrary , there was no food for sale. After this the climb becomes a little tricky , and you need around 2 hours to reach the summit . The views are amazing from the summit. The Koreans hiking the mountain were not only super fit, they were the sweetest people I've met. When I became tired near the summit, so many encouraged me with words like ""Fighting!"" ""Turn around and see how far you have come.""Tips :1. Wear good hiking shoes - at points , the trail is slippery, and good shoes with ankle support are helpful.2. Carry a stick. You can get your own hiking stick or buy one from the store at the bottom.3. Carry plenty of water and snacks.4. Take a selfie at the summit and you can get a certificate at the bottom stating you have completed the climb ( costs 1000 won)5. You do need a certain degree of cardiovascular fitness to make the climb comfortably. But apart from that, the uneven rocks and boulders are a little tough to climb, so make sure you do some core and lower body exercises too. 6. If you climb down slowly, it gets a little dark by the time you reach the base. Carry a head lamp."
Totally recommended! Beautiful views,"We visited Hallasan National Park in mid-November. We did the Gwanwum-sa trail up to Hallasan peak and went down the Seongpanak trail. Although Gwaneum-sa is more challenging on the way up, we totally recommend this route as Seongpanak is way more transited. The trees' autumn colours were beautiful and although at the top it was below 0 degress and misty (making it hard to see the volcano cone and lake), it was an amazing experience. Would definetely repeat!"
Cool Nice View,Should drive up early to enjoy the sunrise and if possible stay for the sunset. Breath breaking View of the Jeju island. 
It's not pleasant to walk this trail,"The whole trip up and down including breaks took us 8 hours. 19.2 km (to and back) at 1200 meters elevation. Most of the trail is covered with volcanic rocks, big and small so it's not so easy to walk. Lots of steps which is not typical in Europe or the Rockies. It was cloudy the day we hiked up. At the peak it was windy, cold and foggy so we couldn't really see much and didn't want to stay longer. I have done many trails in other parts of the world and this is not one I would want to do again."
Must have in Jeju!,"We took the Gwaneumsa trail up to the peak. There is a checkpoint halfway, after 2-2,5 hrs. of hike. The trail gets harder after the checkpoint, but it's also nicer with bridges and very steep stairs. If it's possible, go after rain, because then you can see a small pond in the crater of the volcano. I would recommend to take the Gwaenumsa trail up, because it offers a nice view. To get down, we took Seongpanak trail. The whole tour took us around 8 hours, with a lot of rests and photo-time. :)"
Manicured Mountain,"Wondered how we would with a Korean map, but no need to worry. The path is crystal clear, bounded by rope all the way, and very clearly signed. Much of the path is either wooden planked or hessian carpeted (I jest not !). Starting at 750m it’s a tough 1200m to the top, but a mainlybgentle ascent over 9.6km. The last 150m is a little tougher, but the views of the volcanic basin when you get there make it all worthwhile. Much of the climb amongst trees, and very popular with the locals so busy even on an early Monday start. We took 7 hours including half an hour at the top, very stiff calves this morning..."
Awesome hike and a lot of challenges,"I and my boyfriend traveled here by public bus. We visited the place at the end of October not really December but I did a very late review. It was very easy to get to the place by public buses. The bus stop right in front of the entrance and crossing the street the take the return bus. I researched the bus number, it was wrong. So I asked the bus ticket woman for help and she was really helpful.It was a very challenging hike. Be prepared with a lot of water bottles with you and really exercises before the hike. The trail we took was Seongpanak trail, which is the easiest one. It was early of the fall season. Leaves started turning into different colors, chilling, not so cold, sunny and very enjoyable.We just finished 1500m of height and ate a noodle in a shelter. Then, we turned back (blaming non-stop walking in the previous days :D) and took a quick turn in a shortstop in Saraoseum (beautiful lake, nice view of the mountain).Overall, really enjoy it! Will try it again one day.P/S: it is a natural place so not clean bathroom. A very natural way of toiletry but I really don't like it but can't blame!!"
WINTER HIKING - MOUNT HALLASAN,"fascinating view from bottom until top. but we went on saturday, pack with local hikers. the path is quite easy. about 18km back and forth using seongpanak trail. on the way back we tag along with the person incharge/worker of mt. hallasan, and being offered to use the little train to the way down. best of all, there is no entrence fee charge to hike the national park."
Awesome Hike - Especially Seongpanak trail,"We hiked up the Seongpanak trail in Early September. From Seogwipo City, it is quite remote and we took a long taxi ride to get there. The wy up was beautiful, rising through the forest, befor emerging into stunning views up the peak, trails along gorges and n awesome suspension bridge. Trail was populated but not too busy, the peak was busy but the view was spectacular - you could see clear out to sea on both sides of the island. We took the shallower and busier gwaneumsa trail down, this was a less exciting walk, but has shops and bus stops at the trail head. This is definitely a must do hike if you are able to manage it."
More challenging than they let on!,"First of all ensure you hike on a non rain day. We were worried all week because it was raining. We got a non rain day but cloudy. When got pass 1 km up it was beautiful sunny weather.Know there are 6 trails and they start in different places and not all go to the top. We took the Eorimok Trail (Northwest). It was one of the shortest. We didn't do good research and started too late to do a longer trail.I'm moderately fit. The trail was steep! I was definitely challenged for the first 2km. It was balance of even and uneven ground. Anyone can make it up but it might take you a bit longer if you were unfit. There isn't a drone restrictions and was able to take some great video. Bring water and food. There are places near the top to grab instant noodles and water. There is no washroom on the way up. Bring some tissue and wet wipes just in case.Although we didnt get to go to the summit, it is a must do while visiting. Jeju. "
"Passing by, bye bye...","With limited time to spare, our taxi manage to meander through the winding roads, but ww were a little disappointed that autumn leaves were scant; so all we saw were a hand full of trees in red and orange hues. I guess we were too eager for autumn. Perhaps another time."
Seongpanak to Summit,"I do a fair amount of hiking in the Green Mountains of Vermont, and I found Seongpanak trail to the summit of Mount Hallasan to be enchanting and beautiful! Though the hike may be challenging for folks with knee problems, it is a very well maintained trail (though long) that is worth the effort.Start your day out early and bring plenty of water!"
Stunning,Went in the autumn and was absolutely worth it. I took Gwaneumsa trail up (a bit boring) and Seongpanak trail down (spectacular). Leave early - I went at 6am as summit closes around 11 - 12 depending on the season. 
Beautiful Nature,"Visited in October to see beautiful autumn colors revealing itself. I recommend to start early morning if you want to hike to the summit. The cut off time for the summit can be anytime between 11am to 1pm depending on the season. There are 4 different trails around Hallasan Park - Gwaneumsa and Seongpanak takes you to the top. As Gwaneumsa is a bit boring I recommend to take it when you go up. Then go down Seongpanak, which is very pretty and one you do not need to rush when going down it will give you a chance to enjoy the views. The other trails are Eorimok, Yeongsil that are pretty but don't go all the way up (take them if you are going to be late and can't make the summit anyway). I wanted to try Donnaeko, but it was closed at the time of my visit. Overall great experience, not dofficult hike (unless it's winter) and beautiful views. "
yeongsil to Eorimik,"We went on a cloudy day and the driver drove us all the way to the entrance at Yeongsil. Having a hot afternoon the day before, we thought it would be warmer thN the day before as we Han to walk uphill. The driver saw us in our thin layer, offered me a rain and wind breaker and a pair of gloves. I reluctantly accepted them out of courtesy but later genuinely thanked him after four hours.On a windy and cloudy October morning, the temperature actually dropped as we ascended. Two hours later it got even much colder with strong gusts, as we approached near to split of the main road to either continue uphil to the top, or to go downhill to the other parking lot. I had to use my gloves and another layer there. My husband regretted not bring his hat on a cloudy day to protect his cold ears (anyway later I found his nose sunburnt even on a cloudy day)We used our walking sticks and wore our hiking shoes, which I found very helpful. We saw some people who really had difficulty completing the loop. I suggest tourists first decide whether you physically can complete the four hour trip (adults) to the other parking lot. If not, better discuss with your driver (if using one) to meet in the starting point, or decide where to park your car, if not taking the bus.Pack your bag reasonably and don't take any unnecessary items. Some snacks are helpful though as there are no snack bar at all. I suggest also try to bring your garbage downhill as I don't think there will be regular cleaner everyday up/downhill for hours'hike."
Brilliant! ,"We walked up Yeongsil and down Eriomok. Would definitely recommend getting a taxi right up to the start of the trail if you want to start walking straight away. As other mentioned, it is a long, winding up hill 2.5 km walk from the bus stop. It cost us 30,000 won in a taxi from the other side of Seogwipo. The walk up was beautiful and the rest area with bathrooms at the top was a surprise. We brought all our own food and drinks and didn’t see anywhere selling, which we enjoyed at the top. The walk down was equally lovely although the hard bit lasted longer so we were glad we did it on the way down. A short 10 minute walk from the base of Erimok are the bus stop going to Jeju City or Seogwipo. All in all it was a lovely hike and we thoroughly enjoyed it. Took us about 6 hours including numerous stops here and there and a 30 minute lunch break. "
"Yeongsil going up, Eorimok going down","A relatively easy hike going up Yeongsil trail (lots of climbing). Note that if you're taking the bus, you still need to do a pre-hike of 2.5km going up the mountain after you get off the bus stop. In my opinion, this was harder than the actual hike going up, but it was good preparation. There's also a cafe near the actual entrance. You can buy food here right before going up the trail.The cutoff time for Yeongsil trail is 2pm during the summer, but I would advise you to come early. The hike itself can be done in 1.5 hours, but with picture-taking, it can take as long as 3 hours (and the view at the top is gorgeous in many places!).Wear good hiking shoes. I've seen people wear regular sneakers (and even a guy with leather shoes -- what was he thinking?!), but I swear your feet will hurt if your shoe even manages to survive. Both Yeongsil and Eorimok trails have unpaved trails with unforgiving rocks. Hiking sticks would also help with the descent if you have weak knees.It's safe to hike solo (even for females) during popular days, so you're sure to hike with other people. It's also best to go down where most people are going if you started late (most people drive, so they go down the same trail they went up).In case of emergencies though, you can call their emergency number. (There's mobile coverage for most, if not all, of the trail). Take note of the location posts every few hundred meters. In case you get injured, there's this small train which can take you down, but you have to wait quite a while."
Long walk,We end up at the wrong trail and did not have the time to complete it. Choose the right trail for your budgeted time. Weather is pleasant enough in late Sep but the trail requires proper hiking shoes if you don't want to hurt your knees and avoid sprain. 
Great,Great!! It was a really fantastic climbing for me! It takes so much time and makes you tired but it is great enough!
Eoseungsaegak Trail (1.3km / 30mins),The shortest trail from Eorimok Visitor Centre @ Mt Hallasan. Not that steep trail but can be challenging for those that lack of daily exercise. But the view is superb great and beautiful. Valley and the formation of cloud @ 12 pm are beyond words.
Hikes up Seongpanak Trail,"Oh man... What can I say... It was a difficult hike. We went up 7.5km to the Sara Oreum crater (not even all the way up) and this took 2 hours 15 mins with lots of short breaks in between. The way down was even more difficult than the way up as the rocks were slippery (it rained the night before and on the hike up). Took us two hours to hike down without any breaks in between.The visit Jeju website said ""gentle, sloping trail"".... It was definitely not a gentle sloping trail. The trail was full of large rocks and it was a difficult hike. My advise is to get two hiking sticks if you are new to hiking.If you're from Malaysia, none of our mountains can rival Hallasan, maybe except Mount Kinabalu."
A long route,"Long long route indeed ! Best is to go via one route and come down via another. Scenery could be a bit monotonous but at the end being surrounded by nature is always more rewarding. Ensure to be on the checkpoint by 1pm else one can be very close yet so far to the summit - since you won't be allowed to climb up the remaining 2.5 kms of stretch. If its a brighter day, view is what makes the climb worthwhile.. if its not, aaah bummer, bummer... !"
Loved it - good trails and lovely view,"My husband and I climb Mt Hallasan today. Though my feet are sore, i thoroughly enjoyed my hike. The trail was really well marked and in good condition (Both Seongpanak and Gwaneumsa Trail). We entered via Seongpanak Trail (9.6km gradual inclination - trail was a mix of wooden steps and rocks). It was fairly easy till Jindallaebat Shelter, and then it gets tougher but doable. We started at 8am and reached the summit at 12 pm (we’re not athletic and not super fit). We then descended via Gwaneumsa Trail (8.6km) at 1 pm and arrived at the trail head at 5.30pm. Gwaneumsa is more scenic as many blogs have mentioned so am glad we descended using this trail but Seongpanak trail is easier and is nice as well.Useful info:We took the public bus from Jeju-si city and back. Journey was about an hour one way and we found our way fairly easy with the Naver Map app. The public bus from Gwaneumsa trail entrance only runs on weekends I believe. Bring snacks, lunch and water for your climb. A windbreaker is advisable if you come from the tropics like me.Good shoes are recommended as you’ll be walking on rocks a lot of the time. Bring a raincoat too as there aren’t many shelters.Start early, you have to arrive Jindallaebat Shelter by 1230hrs (you cannot proceed after that) and you must begin your descend by 1430hrs. "
Hallasan Mountain, Hallasan Mountain - Liked going here on the weekdays as well as on the weekends. Very beautiful memories.
personal achievement,"its my first mountain hike, its a straightforward trail but tricky with rocky stone paths at some incline parts. not recommend for those with weak knees and ankles or just go slow n wear ur ankle guards. go up seongpanak (easier as more gradual)and down gwaneumsa (alot of steps, steeper) but gwaneumsa has valley view, creek view and there’s a tiny cave opening near the base with blast out icy wind even in summer.. pretty cool. there’s a bus to and from seongpanak and take taxi from gwaneunsa or prearranged pickup as there’s hardly a bus there.its a total of 9 hrs including rest stops though i rested longer at the peak and pressed on at rest stops. do pace yourself.. calves been killing me midway down the descent. needless to say its a painful walk for the next couple of days.. i slathered all the muscle aches cream.. "
Absolutely worth the effort!,"This is quite a climb in places and in winter time will need crampons, but it will reward you with amazing views on a clear day and even in cloudy weather is really worth the trek. Choose your route by the least fit member of your group and remember to take food and especially water with you.There is a cut off point which you need to reach by 13:00 if you are going right to the top, so that means an early start."
Nice hike!,"Great hike in cool weather. There are alternative hilltops you can go up to, if you don't have time to do a full hike up the main slopes - ask your driver!"
A must go in Jeju,The wonder of nature in Jeju!Take note that there are a few visitor centers around Hallasan National Park. Decide the trail you want to hike before heading to the visitor center.Info extract from VisitKorea website:Hiking Course - Seongpanak Trail: Seongpanak → Dongneung Peak9.6 km / 4 hrs 30 mins each way- Eorimok Trail:Eorimok → Nambyeok Bungijeom 6.8 km / 3 hrs each way- Eoseungsaengak Trail: Eorimok → Eoseungsangak Peak1.3 km / 30 min each way- Yeongsil Trail: Yeongsil - Nambyeok Bungijeom5.8 km / 2 hrs 30 mins each way- Gwaneumsa Trail:Gwaneumsa Temple - Dongneung Peak8.7 km / 5 hrs each way
Quite hard but AMAZING!!,"Our favourite activity on Jeju Island! Pretty limited view from the top due to clouds but great experience hiking up and down the mountain. We started at 7:30AM up Seongpanak trail (181 Bus until trail entrance from Jeju City 3,000 won pP) and arrived at the top of the mountain three hours later (with very short stops at the breaking points).We then went down Gwaneumsa trail which took about three and half hours (felt a bit steeper) but definitely more picturesque! At the bottom there is the 475 bus (not frequent, ca. hourly but you can kill time at the nearby temple or little supermarket). The bus gets you to Jeju National University (1,200 Won pP) and from there you can take other local busses like the 365 (also 1,200 Won pP) which get you into the city centre. Most important:- Bring lots of water (we had 2 Liters each and easily finished it before the end), some people had no water or hardly any and where really struggling! No shops on the trail!- sun screen and a hat (although ca. 2/3 of the trail was covered by trees)- take enough food because you will burn energy! (Remember to take all your trash back with you as there are no bins/cans anywhere on the mountain).- good hiking footwear because you are often skipping from stone to stone- there are cut of points on both trails ca 2km (guess) before the top which you have to pass before 13:00 in August (so don’t start your hike too late). We saw some hikers that had to run in the lunch time heat to still pass the cut off point.Hope this helps!! Enjoy!! "
Nice hiking,We are short of time so we picked the shortest Eoseungsaengak trail (1 hour return). The view is nice & the hike is easy. 
Awesome nature!,I don't have the exact words to describe the beauty of Hallasan National Park. Loved exploring the jungle.
Gwaneumsa trail,"I was planning on going up gwaneumsa and coming down seongpanak but seongpanak is closed until 31st Jul, 18 so I came down the the same. It took me about 3.5 hr to climb up, and 3 hrs to come down. Together with my lunch breaks, I finished the entire round trip in a little over 7 hours. Unfortunately, it was really misty when I was at the summit, so, i didn't get to see the crater lake. I highly recommend bringing a pair of trekking poles and good hiking shoes."
Yeongsil Trail,"Our stamina is not so good so it took us 5 hours round trip for Yeongsil Trail up to Witsae Oreum Shelter and back. There was no Ramen available at the shelter so if you plan to go, better bring lunch box, you will be tired and eat a lot anyway. There are plenty of hikers from old people to children so you wont get lost, even if you want. Yeongsil trail has 4 parts of itFirst part is wooden steps, you will pass some creeks and a lot of shade / trees.Second part is the most strenous part. Lots of rocks and steep climbs , so watch your step. There are some observation deck for you to take photos and rest. And more wooden steps with crazy inclination. After you pass the big rocks crossing,(third part) it will be open area with no shade and this has the best view. And the most leisure part because its flat with almost no inclination. There is water fountain where you can fill up your drink for free. Walk 10-15 minutes from the water fountain and you will reach Witsae Oreum Shelter. Tips : Use sunscreen all over your body, even if its windy and cold at the beginning of the trail, when it reach the open area with no shade, the sun ray will hit you so hard. Wear hat. My scalp got sunburnt. Even better go with long sleeve and long pants. Go very very early like 7 am because the parking lot will be full later."
Seongpanak trail closing,"The Seongpanak trail that goes to the summit is curentlyclose, until July 31st. I went all the way to the start of Seongpanak trail and had to take 2 buses to go Gwaneumsa trail.The hike was nice but difficult. The first part was nice, 3,1km of normal hiking, until we reached the hard part, very steep, with stairs and rock. The climb fromSamgakbong shelter to the summit was not too hard, but a bit warm because of the sun. It as very humid, so be sure to pack a lot of waterand food as there are no vendors on the trail. It easy to reachthe trail by bus, but we took a taxi back to our hotel as we were too tired. A very good exercice and a good hike. I would doit again! ;)"
Good walks and nice views,"We did the Yeongsil track which is 11,5km (5,7km up and 5,7km down) in total. there were about more than 3,500 stairs to go up only. The views were pretty nice. WEAR SUNSCREEN AND A HAT!! "
Be prepared for 4 seasons even in summer ,"I hiked for 14 hours (amateur hiker) because I'm slow and also have not been doing any exercise for years... It was raining and windy quarterway through. Then it was sunny on the hike back. Since it was misty at the peak, so I didn't see the lake. Go prepared with water and food. Two bottles of water to last you to the top. When you come down, refill water at portable water spot. When I said food, like actual kimbap, bento or even cup noodles. In fact, bring all three. If one of the guy I bumped into did not give me his kimbap, I'd have starved for sure cause all I brought was three bananas and protein bar. Some people even offered me mini chocolate bars and tangerines. Bring isotonic drink if you want to. Bring Hiking stick(s) if you're uncoordinated like me. Bring windbreaker for sure and make sure it's waterproof. Get a good hiking shoes tha can grip because I slipped a lot on the way down. Because of my lack of preparation, I've suffered for sure coupled with my lack of exercise lol. So really, go prepared. And if you're like me with determination, and don't mind 14 hours hike, please go early like 5am. Though they do have transportation to bring you down should you really need it. I just missed it... "
Getting close to nature and a volcano,"Located in the middle of the Jeju island, it's a very beautiful and well managed National Park. Unfortunately, we were too late for hiking to the Hallasan and back. We decided to hike to the top of a directly opposite and much lower peak. It was easier and we were almost alone on the whole trail as well as at the peak. In the end, we had a nice picknick at the tourist and information center. If you really want to hike to the Hallasan itself, arrive and start as early as possible, be prepared with enough water, some food/snacks and other important hiking utensils."
"Great view, worth the hike!","Our family hiked up with the Yeongsil trail. We parked the car, started from 1280m above sea level and did around 400m more. The trail was well managed and the hike just kept going uphill, you go through endless stairs. The view got better and there was a rest station where you can get food like cup noodles. We didn't reach the top because the path was not available when we went, definitely check out the availability of the trails before you head to any. Overall, good experience and am definitely recommending this."
"Amazing day, even without a view","Sadly the day that we had reserved for Hallasan was very foggy. Nevertheless it was amazing walk. We went up the Seongpanak Trail, which was a steady easy elevation the whole way - can only recommend to those of you who are in doubt of your stamina like we were :) On the way down, we chose the Gwaneumsa Trail. That was rather difficult as it is stairs the whole way (app. 8km). My runners knee started acting up, my boyfriends weak ankle was calling for attention... Lets just say that this trail was really exhausting for the joins! At the parking lot, we got a taxi back to Seongpanak, where we parked our rental car for 17k. All in all, it was challenging, but definitely worth it! (we were impressed about how clean and untouched the nature was)"
Exhausting trip to the Top,"I hiked to the top today. I had decided not to do this but at breakfast this morning a gal from Korea highly suggested I go, so I did. I took the Seongpanak trail up and back. I got there a little after 10 and was told that it was a bit late to make it to the top so I went out very quickly so I would make it to the Check station by 1 PM. If you get there after that time they won’t let you up to the top. I made it and got to the top. At 2:30 they make everyone come down. I came down slowly and at the end I was all by myself walking those trails as it got darker. I didn’t get down until about 7 PM. Because I was in such a hurry to get up it took me much more time to come down than it did to go up. As I was walking down a deer jumped right in front of me And then jumped away. I brought two bottles of water and lunch. That was perfect for me. There are restrooms on the way up but not at the top. They are outhouses. I do not have hiking shoes with me, just my slip on sketchers, so my feet are still sore from walking on those lava rocks with these shoes. This is also the reason it took me so long to get down, my feet were really sore At that point and I had to rest them during the descent. There is a Monorail track next to the trail. Today I saw them taking down some people who couldn’t make it down on that."
Depends on wheather and physical fitness,It takes whole day here since morning to finish the track. Its for prople who have enough physical strength. Those who are not strong enough will be suffer and thus not enjoy this place. It was also little raining when we were there. So better go to other Jeju Island tourist attraction. 
Challenging 18+km hike up to Summit and down,"We did the hike up the Summit via the 8.7km Gwaneumsa Trail and down via the 9.6km Seongpanak Trail. Though parts of the Trail are marked deceptively yellow and green (""easy""), we couldn't feel our legs for 3 days thereafter. Very rocky/uneven terrain at most parts of the Trail - challenging without the aid of hiking poles. Good hiking boots is a definite must. Please note there is a specific cut-off time at each Trail checkpoint (which may differ depending on season) and also a specific cut-off time to descend from the Summit. Hence, it is recommended to start as early as possible. We started at 8am and completed around 7.30pm (which was getting really dark by then). Though tiring, the hike is still the highlight of our Jeju trip and memorable for many reasons. The feeling of walking above the clouds (at 1,950m) and having accomplished such a challenging hike is priceless."
Bring SO MUCH WATER,"We went up the Gwaneumsa Trail and down Seongpanak and thought it was a great route. Seongpanak has much better views that are easier to see while walking down, otherwise your back is facing the beauty on the way up. Both trails are majority rock. Meaning, nearly the entire hike is trying to find rocks to climb up/down. There are some wood paths, bridges, and stairs, but mostly rock which is hard on the arches of your feet. I used regular Adidas sneakers which worked, however the bottom of my feet began to ache on the way down. On the way up Gwaneumsa, we couldn't refill our water at all, then at the top - NOTHING! It wasn't until 2 km down Seongpanak (6 hours after we began the hike) that there was free water access. Nothing was sold on this hike, even though I read about ramen and drinks being sold. I was DYING for water. Bring tons!!! At Gwaneumsa there is a store to purchase beverages and 2 servings of gimbap for 3,000 won, as well as walking sticks for 20,000. I didn't use one but many did and it seemed to help balancing on all the rocks. I began the hike at 7:00am and was down by 3:45 - this included a half an hour break at the top and 2 min stop at each base camp (there were about 4 or so on each route.) I'm not an experienced hiker at all and really doubted my ability to do this, but it IS manageable! Today I can't walk but it was totally worth it.PS - for those interested, drones are NOT allowed to be flown at the top however there was absolutely no indication of this in English anywhere."
BRING TONS OF WATER,"We went up the Gwaneumsa Trail and down Seongpanak and thought it was a great route. Seongpanak has much better views that are easier to see while walking down, otherwise your back is facing the beauty on the way up. Both trails are majority rock. Meaning, nearly the entire hike is trying to find rocks to climb up/down. There are some wood paths, bridges, and stairs, but mostly rock which is hard on the arches of your feet. I used regular Adidas sneakers which worked, however the bottom of my feet began to ache on the way down. On the way up Gwaneumsa, we couldn't refill our water at all, then at the top - NOTHING! It wasn't until 2 km down Seongpanak (6 hours after we began the hike) that there was free water access. Nothing was sold on this hike, even though I read about ramen and drinks being sold. I was DYING for water. Bring tons!!! At Gwaneumsa there is a store to purchase beverages and 2 servings of gimbap for 3,000 won, as well as walking sticks for 20,000.

Insane hike but worth it,"Tips & things to take note:- Bring LOTS of water. On average 2litres per pax.- Bring sufficient food - basically breakfast,lunch,dinner.- Got to reach the checkpoint by 1pm to be allowed to attempt summit- Got to start descent from summit by 2.30pm- Gets cold and windy at the peak so bring a windbreaker.- You have to carry your own trash down. No bins on the mountain at all.We took 11hours and took the Seongpanak trail up and Gwaneumsa trail down. Seongpanak is easiest as its gentler but its the longest trail. Gwaneumsa is much more scenic. We were beginner hikers and hence probably took longer. The tourist centre told us it would take ~9hrs. Spotted a deer on our way down on the Gwaneumsa trail. It was pretty scary though, we walked for 1hr+ without spotting a single human. (probably cause we were slow)My legs ached for 4 days straight but I have no regrets. My knees and ankles were insanely sore by the end of the hike. If you've even the slightest knee/leg issues, please think THRICE before you attempt Hallasan.Also, toilets are only available at the bottom (before the hike) and at the checkpoint. The toilets are GROSS. I couldn't do it no matter how hard I tried. Toilet was damp and stinky and lots of flies. No water system & its a squat system for ladies. Basically peeing into a hole filled with other people's waste. Saw another lady peeing in the woods instead...Also, all the announcements are in Korean, though signboards are in English.Aim to start hiking by 7am-8am. Any later, you may not reach checkpoint/summit in time unless you have a good enough stamina.Hiking sticks and shoes would help tremedously. Though we did it with regular sneakers. LOTS OF BUGS. Bring insect repellent though again, we didn't have one.Overall, its worth it and wouldn't do it again but have no regrets."
Wetland reserve,"Went to the 1100m point where the wetland reserve is. Didn’t occur to me that wetland exists on mountain top. A round trip takes about 20mins and was quite scenic. It was foggy when we were there, which adds to the ambience. Our guide pointed out some of the edible leaves and tree sap. Very interesting stopover on the way to the south. "
nice,nice place for hiking but must start as early as possible. it's about 1950 metres high. no more entry to the national park after 2.30pm
amazing view,"Check the weather forecast, it was raining and very foggy mid way up the mountain, we went back another day after the sky cleared. Prepare warmer outer wear as it get very cold."
Back to nature ,This is a great place for to hike especially if you have been binge eating in Jeju. You can burn some fats and take pretty photos at the peak. Recommend you take the 1 hour trail for amateurs.
breathtaking (literally),"we were definitely not prepared for this - in terms of experience and equipment!started off at about 9am on the Eorimok route. the entrance was a 10 min walk from the bus stop. then, it was off on the hike!initially the trail was straightforward. then it gradually went into a steep ascent. the path was quite rocky and unstable. but there were sufficient rest stops along the way. also people going in the same and opposite direction to you so you will not be alone (unless you hike in the middle of the night)there were also multiple signboards along the route providing interesting facts about Hallasan and also maps showing your current location and remaining distances to go to the next point.there was almost a natural portable water point where you can refill your bottles. remember to stay hydrated throughout and take breaks when needed.needless to say, the views along the route were truly breathtaking but the higher elevation you reach, the colder it becomes. also, the winds were very strong!we reached the Witseoreum shelter at about 12pm and had lunch there. The locals actually brought hot water in their thermos flasks and had cup ramen there!after lunch, we started our descent on the Yeongsil trail and reached the entrance of Yeongsil at about 2pm and there was a 2km walk out of the entrance to the bus stop.by then our legs were aching and heavy, but we pushed on. overall the hike took about 5 hrs.in summary, we should have worn more proper hiking footwear, wear thicker clothing (as higher you go, the colder it gets) and more food and snacks!we decided we will come back to attempt the summit next time."
Gwanmeusan Trail,"Hiked to the top of Hallasan yesterday morning through the Gwanmeusan Trail - started at about 7:10am and were back in our car at 2:30pm - so this start and finish time includes breaks, and you'll need them even if you are in okay or good shape. It was a bit disappointing to see the majority of water bodies in the mountain are dry at the moment - just a few ponds on the early parts of the trail, and the crater lake at the summit, which we expected would be much deeper. The trail has a combination of dirt, rocks, and steps/bridges. I wish the steps and parts of the trail didn't include so many sharp rocks - your feet WILL feel them! We did the hike in running shoes because we don't have hiking boots here. I can see the climb being a lot easier with hiking shoes. Some parts of the trail are very steep so if you have serious knee problems, I don't think this is the trail for you. Do bring lots of water and snacks - we had two liters of water for each of us and I still think my husband got dehydrated rather badly. There is really nothing to eat on the trails so bring snacks. Visibility yesterday wasn't great - pollution has been pretty high in Jeju the past couple of days - but it's still a GREAT, BEAUTIFUL view from the top. I loved all the flowers you see growing in the rocky sides of the mountain in the last third of the trail. Very happy I did it and it's a great hike, but there is not a lot to see before you get to the top. We went down the same trail, so a total of 17.4kms. It'd be interesting to see what the other trails are like, but I don't think I need to summit again."
Great for hikers and hill walkers. Worth it,"Halla Mountain or Hallasan is one sadistic hike. For the month of May 2018, Gwaneumsa Trail is the only trail open that summits Halla. Seongpanak is having maintenance done.We did Gwaneumsa Trail... with one slow hiker... we got to parking at about 7:30am and we were walking by 8:06am. It is beautiful and green, especially in Spring. There is one restroom stop about 1/4 way and another 3/4 way at Samgakbong shelter. There was no other support. Take water, take food, take toilet paper just in case.READ: There is only one potable water stop. It is after Samgakbong about 3.5 hours into the hike at the last downhill before the bridge and start of final red part of trail. There is a hose at the corner at bottom os stairs before the bridge. Fill up here both going up and down.Also wear good walking or hiking shoes. We witnessed two people's shoes rip up and one guy had to walk back 2.5 hours with no shoe. There is no rescue for small issues. There is a supply cart that goes up once or twice a day but only for serious rescue. There is AED in Samgakbong shelter too. No food for sale when we went in April 2018.The reason for the difficulty is the climb and distance... mostly on volcanic rocks... large ones... and lots of stairs of wood and of stone.We left at 8:06 and back in the parking lot at about 5:30. All day event. 9.5 hours going slow up Gwaneumsa Trail."
Wonderful Hiking Experience Amidst the Difficulties,"We hiked up the Seongpanak Trail and hiked down Gwaneumsa Trail. These are the only 2 trails to the summit and hence it is the best option to get the best of both trails.Iit was a huge satisfying feeling to reach the top and then to descend safely. It was not difficult if we were more prepared. Here are some pointers to note:(1) We went in Spring and therefore we were not expecting any snow. However, probably due to a snow storm 1 or 2 weeks ago, some areas were still covered in snow. As we didn't bring any hiking sticks nor cramptons, the descend was difficult and dangerous. I slipped many times. There was even one path which was totally covered with snow and we had to detour to the side which was hard given the little space and all the snow. As we descended via Gwaneumsa Trail, it was more steep and therefore the snow made it such a challenging task to hike down.(2) There are no water point. We thought we could get some water from toilets but there are no taps in toilets too. We ran out of water towards the end.(3) No food. Do bring your own food as you would not be able to buy any on the way up and down. We brought our own snacks. Also be prepared to bring your own rubbish down the mountain. There are no rubbish bins for you to discard your rubbish.(4) Do allocate more time for the hike. We thought we could do it within half a day but we spent much longer time. By the time we reached the bottom, it was already 4 - 5 plus. Even though we were relatively fast and hardly stopped, we still require that much time which probably was also due to the snowed paths (lots of snow).It was a unforgetable experience and we were so happy we did it! Will we do it again? Definitely!"
Hallasan National Park,Im so exited to visit Hallasan National Park place in this June. Read many reviews about this place. 
Gwanmeusan Trail... be prepared to be impressed ,"We walked up the Gwanmeusan Trail, only 20 minutes from downtown Jeju-si. It took us, going slowly with lots of rests about 9.5 hours. Good hiking shoes required. We witnessed multiple shoe failures. You have to hike back down shoeless if your shoes rip apart and they will due to the volcanic rocks used on the rrail. The rocks are cute until they aren't. They are murder on the feet, ankles, knees, and legs on the way down.We went in April 20 and it was warm... only one water stop about 3/4 way up.18+ miles round trip. Please ask questions if you have concerns. It is quite breathtaking but a strenuous hike. Many turn back early. Must make it to the Samgakbong shelter by 12:30. No support on the trail.... 2 bathrooms though about 1/4 and 3/4 way up. Must start return hike by 2PM... still took us 4 hours to down due to strenuous terrain and infinite number of stairs."
Seong panak route,I went there too late so I cannot reach the top of the mountain. This route is 9 km and the walkway was pretty bad because it's all lava rock and it's raining before. We have to reach the shelter at 6 km by 12.30 but we can't so we had to go back when we reached the first shelter. I think you should try other route if you have a little time like me.
"Went for spring, got snow instead","Living in a country where there is no chance the snow will fall, we are so excited to experience snow even though by that time it is nearly end of March. The view is amazing, though I cannot go for the hike as I went there with my mom. Will definitely go again and bring my hiking partner next time."
Great hike,"In April, watch the weather. Aim to get to the trail head around 7 to 8am. Make sure you wear good hiking shoes it is rocky in most parts even though there are stretches of boarding. It is windy up top so you might not stay atvthe summit for more than 30 mins but the views are breathtaking. This is not a boring hike as some may say. It is a classic in these parts"
Amazing hiking!,"We went to Hallasan with my brother: the hiking is just wonderful, this is a must-do if you love nature & trekking. The weather was ok, a lot of wind nonetheless, be careful when going. If you have the opportunity, you should definitely go to the summit!"
Easy but long route before check point,"Its very important to choose the suitable route, as there are different route to go to the top. I didn't notice and chose a long route, and so not enough time to pass the check point at designated time and not allowed to go to the top. Better get there earlier. The trail is easy to walk. Better bring suitable gear such as stick to prevent slippery ice surface on top of the mountain."
Stunning View,"We selected yeongsil trail since we rarely hike in own country and it is recommended for beginner. We started our hike at 9:30am and it took us 3 hours to reach the shelter while 2 hours to come down. We used back same route to come down since we drove there. The cup noodle shop was closed when we reached the shelter, grateful we brought some biscuit and roti else we will starving after long hike hours. We didn’t expect still having ice on mountain since it is turning spring. This get bit challenging especially to me as my shoes a bit tough to walk on the ice. But luckily a korean lady offered her stick to me and hold my hand to cross the ice path. It really make a different with the stick support. It is really recommended to get prepare self well with good hiking shoes, enough water and food."
Spring hike - beautiful view ,"Just did the hike on 30 March.Trail: seongpanak up and gwaneumsa down. Goes to summit. (highly recommend to do this trail Cos going up by gweumusa is really steep though the view is nicer for gweumusa) Time taken: 4.5hrs up and 4hrs down (please go early and check the time that you need the reach the shelter and summit by. Think should be by 1230 reach shelter and by 2 to leave summit) Weather: good. Cold in the morning but as you hike, you will perspire and definitely need minimum sweaters. I was only wearing teeshirt and windbreaker. In the end only tee-shirt cos it's getting warmer and you climb and when the sun is out. Need crampons? Yes!!! It helped alot especially at the icy areas both going up and down. Not too sure where you can buy it but I managed to rent it from my hostel. Though I did see people without it, and they did just fine. I was wearing track shoes kind. So crampons helped alot! How to get there: I went there from Jeju city and took bus 281 from bus terminal to seongpanak bus stop. Coming back from gwaneumsa trail: took bus 475 back to jeju national university and change bus 360 to Jeju city. Please check with bus driver or use kakao map/bus to help as Google Map doesn't seem to help much with he routes. Bus 475 have some timings going back. You can always find out from the visitors center at the gweumusa base. It is situated at the left side as you make your way down passing through the car park. Shelters and food: not sure if I did miss it.. But I didn't see any food vendors, drinks stall as I hiked up and down. So I was really thirsty as the end of the trail. There's a small restaurant and a convenience store at gwaneumsa trail end. So please bring ALOT of water like at least 1.5L. Bring along food to eat up there and also plastic bag to put your trash and there are no rubbish bins around. "
A must Visit place,"We visit this place on February which is in the winter season, the place was tremendously beautiful. It is covered by the snow and I like it. The best place to take a good photos. Highly recommended and surely will visit this place again in the future. "
Unexpected!,Beeing there on 23rd March 2018 and it still have a thick snow. Such a great and beautiful scenery. Must visit place if you come to Jeju Island
Be prepared,"We went to Eorimok trial thinking that we can go up with normal tracking boots. To our surprise, there was snow even though it was in the middle of spring. Due to the snow, we cannot go up the mountain without crampons. We still enjoyed ourselves at the carpark area as it was beautiful."
"Nice View, amazing weather, good hiking exercise","Nice weather to hike in Feb, good view when surrounding area is all cover by snow. By quite slipping when going down the hill."
Disappointed ,"Although it is covered as one of the southern route day trip itinerary, we couldn’t do much as a sightseeing tourist as none of us is prepared to hike up the mountain without proper gears and limitation of time. I wouldn’t suggest to visit this place at all if you are a sightseeing tourist. Utterly disappointed."
Nice View..Excellent Hiking Trail,Love the amenities at the place. Clean and functional. The view is breathtaking and there is ample area for picture taking etc. before the serious business of hiking.Make sure wear and bring proper gear and supplies as there are limited item at the sole shop at the base.
A must do!,"I was hesitating to climb the mountain in the winter, but it is definitely a must do! It was so amazing with the snow. The path itself was 'easy' to walk and to follow. Tip: buy crampons at the start of the trail (12,000 krw (I think) for the cheap ones)."
High recommended,The view is breathtaking. I wish we could spend more time there but it gets dark so you might want to head down before the sunset. 
It's white mountian which is highest in Korea.,You could enjoy your time at top lake which is beauty of halla mountian.just try and visit Jeju island and tracking the mountain which are all snowing haven !!!Do it and feel best in Korea.
Winter festival,"We went to eorimok trail to enjoy the winter festival. Great outdoor fun for children. Best part its free (except for 1,000krw parking fees). My kid loves d slide!! There’s even a museum to learn how hallasan mountain was formed. In my opinion this is the best place to visit in jeju."
DO not go on Jan to this place,"Nothing to see at all, as this time of the year all trees only left with brunch, nothing else. place is small, map look big however not as much as we could think."
Quite challenging on the way down but totally worth the hike,"I woke up really early to get ready for this hike. I took the first bus 281 from the old bus terminal in Seogwipo leaving at 6am. We arrived at Seongpanak trail entrance about half an hour later. I did this trail mid January and you need crampon for this. Personally, I don’t like slippery surface so crampons really give me the confidence. But I saw people on the hike didn’t have crampons. Some other people hiked in their running shoes. Snow was thick but you basically walked on top so I guess You don’t necessarily need hiking boots. Unless you go off trail, the snow will be knee deep. It was such a nice feeling to see everybody get up and early to start the hike when it’s still dark out. The hike up was not very challenging and it took me about 4.5 hours. I’m an extremely slow walker. Keep in mind that there is cut off time. If you start too late and couldn’t get up to the last shelter on Seongpanak trail before 12pm, you are not allowed to go to the summit. The view at the top was so beautiful. It was very windy though. I took Gwaneumsa trail down since I wanted to change views. That was challenging. My knees hurt so bad even though I already wore knee braces. It’s shorter than Seongpanak trail but it took me almost the same amount of time. There was one part quite steep and I didn’t notice the rope which you can hold on to, I slid down and broke my trekking pole. Apart from being slippery, the trail is quite rocky and by the end of the day, after a beautiful sunny day, the snow started melting and made the trail very slushy. There was time I almost gave up, my whole body hurt and I started to get blister on my toes. When I got to the entrance of the trail, I took bus 475 for 10 mins to a university entrance station then changed to bus 281 to go back to Seogwipo. I guess you can take 281 directly from Gwaneumsa to Seogwipo but I didn’t know where it was so I followed the crowd. I totally recommend this hike. "
Be alert of the time and weather,"I was told by the reception assistant at the guesthouse that the trails to hike Mt Hallasan were closed when that day it was snowing heavily.When the weather got better, I made a mistake when we reached the office ticket too late to hike. No one is allowed after 1200 noon, winter time.Also, I made a mistake of not being alert to the weather forecast. Due to the rain and ill equipped, I decided against hiking. Thus, I ended up at the nearby rest area and visited the wetland instead. It was beautiful"
Fantastic colors of leaves in autumn,"The road brings you to an altitude of 1100 m close to e Mt. Hallasan which with 1900 m is the highest mountain in South Korea. They have built a walk with wooden planks that brings you to nice trees without getting wet feet. The walk takes about one hour when taking Pictures, if you rush it is only 20 minutes."
Really Recommended,"We climbed Halla via Yeongsil Trail on Christmas. Really worth the hiked, yet when we reached the view point on top it was covered by the clouds.Be sure you wear layers of clothes, sweater and jackets as it’s really cold up there with the wind gust blowing so hard in winter.Despite of the clouds on top, we can still take so many pictures on our way up.3.5 hours with many stops for photo session and 1.15 for went down.We travelled from Seogwipo - Vistacay world cup hotel, took the 282 blue bus around 9.30am in the bus stop across the eMart, and dropped at Jungmun Elementary School (We should’ve start earlier actually).From there we went to the other bus stop (it’s near the junction) and took bus 240 straight to Yeongsil Ticket Office and walked about 2 km to the Yeongsil Entrance. There’re small store where you can buy some food and hot drinks as well as hiking equipments like Crampons, Hike stick, gloves etc.Notice that i think in winter the crampons is a Mandatory (except you come with a full hiking equipments) as we’re not allowed to enter the trail only with our bare sneakers.So we bought two pairs of crampons cost 70.000 Won (pick your size carefully as it can squeezed hard your feet if it to small)."
Which is the highest point I can drive up to in the mountain?,"I am thinking of driving up the mountain, where would be a good pit-stop to enjoy some view with snow?"
1100 Altitude Wetland ,"What a wonderful winter at 1100 Altitude Wetlands, Hallasan. The white snow view make us crazy, its really beautiful. Kids sledding, photography and enjoy the white scene. Its a must go place in Winter. We traveled by bus 240."
"It's great experience of snow, for asians",It was snowing in December and they have a small winter festival. It was fun to have the snow experience on the mountain. The road to the mountain was clear and I'm sure the authority makes a great effort on that. It's a safe drive even for those who has not drove in icy road before. 
Veryyyy cold ,Make sure you have full clothings on as it is very cold out there. you will find lots of snow to play around. Adventurous people can trek as well. 
Beautiful place to visit,One of compulsory place to go in jeju. Beautiful. There is a wild deer too but it depends on luck to see it. 
Worth to hike~~^^,Starting the beautiful day with sunrise on top of Hallasan Mountain. Refresh and restore yourself. Worth to hike~~^^ 
Winter Hike,We went on a hike at Hallasan National Park and the scenery was beautiful. The park was beautiful and well kept. 
Great Views,Only did a short hike in the park but the views were amazing and I will definitely go back when I can.
It's tiring but Worth !!,The scene is real nice and definetly is an enjoyable hike. A must to visit when you r in jeju. Don't miss this amazing place.
Breathtaking ,"So we went to Hallasan but didn't have much time, so we've decided to do the yeongsil train until the shelter and then go back the other way (eorekon? Haha). It was about 2hours each ways so 4 hours total. The mountain is free but to get there it's either a bus from Jeju city hall or a taxi (about 27.000 won - 25€?). You have to be there before 12:00 pm otherwise it's closed. Really good activity, winter time so there was snow, pretty cool!!But wear good shoes and some coat because it's super windy there !I recommend it 100 times. "
Fresh atmosphere ,Hallasan national park is a beautiful place with fresh atmosphere. My family was so pretty enjoy. We took many photos hahaa
Good view mountain,Walk to the highest mountain in Jeju. Then you can find a excellent view and enjoy the strong wind. Remember bring more water and some food. And keep clean for the natural environment. 
Trekking Mount Hallasan via the Yeongsil Trail,"I’m not a huge trekker, I don’t go trekking at every place travelled. We picked the Yeongsil trail as it was said to be relatively easy and also one of the most scenic. We drove our way up and paid about 1000 KRW for parking. We reached around 8am? Plenty of parking lots then. As we were leaving around 12pm the parking lot was already packed. So my advice if you’re going and taking this trail, please go early. Considering how we had no proper gear, we just wore our usual winter wear and went ahead with sports shoes, we fared pretty well. Some things to take note of though, it was slightly slippery as we went up. We saw locals with proper trekking boots and they also brought trekking poles with them. I’m pretty sure those poles came in handy as there were some routes that were just rocks and took a bit of effort to walk on them. Overall, it was well patched with properly wooden planks for “stairs”. I enjoyed the trek a lot. I’ll be back the next time round. :)"
"Absolutely fantastic, gorgous","We went in fall and took the Youngsil pathway. There are about 4-5 different ways to hike up. I thought ours was supposed to be an easier one, but Id say it is like walking up the stairs endlessly. Once you get high up enough, you have a fantanstic view, and in fall, it is all red and yellow leaved. It's absolutely gorgeous and worth the hike. The way up and down is also very much enjoyable. But there is quite a bit of people, so if you are slow, make space for others coming behind you."
Lost my way descending Mt. Hallasan and ended at Donnaeko cemetry,"For 1st time hikers climbing Mount Hallasan, take note of the different hike trails AND the closing time for each trail. This is especially if you drove on your own and parked at 1 of the 5 (one of the locals told me there are 5 different car parks at different foot of the mountain)If you are climbing Mt Hallasan to reach Baengnokdam (the crater top), do not take the Eorimok trail as it does not lead there. I made the 1st mistake taking this trail and the trail ended 3 quarters way up the mountain and you only get to see the side of the mountain top. I made the 2nd mistake not watching my time and could not descend Hallasan from the trail (Eorimok) where I came as apparently it closes at 2pm, and there was a park warden stopping me from taking the trail back and kept ushering me to take the other way (towards Donnaeko trail) to descend. The descend took 4 hours and the trail was treacherously full of rocks. You could tell that it was a trail less taken as there were over-grown bushes covering parts of the trail. Your only guidance of where to go was a thin cord string tied from tree to tree and red strips of cloth tied on the string. If you weren't too careful and lost sight of the guiding string, you may actually go off tangent of the trail. There are no lights, very few signage and are all in Korean, so if you are like me with no understanding of Korean, good luck. And that wasn't the end. Donnaeko trail actually ends up at Donnaeko cemetery. So when I got to the foot of Hallasan, it was pitch dark (6pm+ and no street lamps), by myself, and I had to walk for 1 hour through the cemetery to get to Donnaeko car park (which was 30 mins driving distance away from Eorimok car park where my car was T-T)."
The tallest in South Korea,"Is a relatively user-friendly trail from Seongpanak trail head, with plenty of well-laid staircase. In areas with no staircase, the path is pretty rocky. Is just a very long trail, about 10km each way and you need to adhere to the cut off time."
Beautiful...worth the hike!,"There are only 2 trails that lead to the peak of Hallasan. Gwaneumsa and seongpanak trail. We took the seongpanak trail up and gwaneumsa trail down. It was no easy hike for sure. It took us 10 hours to hike up and back down ( late 20's, amateur!). We thought we give it a go and hike all the way to the peak since we were there. The scenery was breathtaking and definitely worth the hike. autumn foliage was amazing (but our leg muscles were aching real bad the next day). tons of people though. best to start the hike early about 6.30am if you wish to reach the top and if you are an amateur hiker with not-so-active lifestyle. be well prepared with adequate clothing, proper shoes and snacks"
Peaceful if you ignore the people,"The mountain is extremely busy with tons of people and older koreans are not always very friendly toward foreigners, but the rude people are exceptions. In general the hike is wonderful, just very long. There is beautiful scenery and forests to enjoy. Take a jacket for the top as its cold and start early. "
Tough but rewarding hike,"Mount Hallasan is the tallest mountain in South Korea, so expect this hike not to be an easy one. For the less trained hikers, you can go half way and stop at the first crater, which also offers beautiful views. "
"Hallasan National Park, Jeju Island",It was a beautiful mountain as tree leaves were changing colors. And there was many many people who came to sightseeing from all over the country & some foreign countries. The weather was perfect as well.
Halfway up and tired,"My husband and I made the mistake of 1. Going there at 11am instead of bright and early 2. Not driving all the way up to the entrance of the trail. There are in total 4 trails and we took the one that was located south west of the island. We had to hike 2.5km from the car to the entrance before we even begin the trail. The hike is tiring and if you are doing it leisurely like I was, I will suggest good hiking shoes, hiking sticks and lots of water. We did not reach the crater and turned back after reaching the rocks. The view was still wonderful and the weather was great but I do not encourage beginners like me to go all the way. Do what you can and enjoy the view. Its better that way. "
Yeongsil Trail,"We travelled from Seogwipo by bus to Jungmun Elementary school. Thereafter, we were supposed to hop on another bus to the stop nearest to the entrance of Yeongsil Trail. However, we did not read the bus schedule careful enough to notice the change in the schedule during winter. The bus starts later and ends earlier during winter. We ended sharing a cab with the other 2 tourists who happened to be there earlier than us and were heading to the same destination. The guy who mended the convenient store near the bus stop was so nice that he helped us to call the taxi. It was a blessing in disguise since the taxi actually sent us right to the door step of the Yeongsil Trail entrance in which otherwise, we would have to walk up for about 2 km to the starting point of the trail. Should you travel with baggage, the park office (which I guess so) can keep them for you. I’m not sure of the storage capacity or if lockers are available, or this is just an additional service provided for those who happen to travel there with their baggage.It took us slightly more than 3 hours to hike up to Witsoreum Shelter since we’re quite slow and took plenty of photos. The Koreans took 2 hours only. The wind was very strong, so do take care of your scarf or anything which is light. Witsoreum Shelter is where you can opt to go back down with the same trail or by another trail, Eurimok Trail. However, the other trail was closed on that day.There’s a canteen and restrooms at Witsoreum Shelter. The canteen sells instant noodle and simple snacks. After eating and disposing the residue of the noodle, you have to bring the trash back for disposal. Plastic bag for keeping your trash is provided but I find it rather thin. However, we brought some plastic bag along with us for this purpose as well since we had some snacks while hiking up.The fog was building up when we left at about 1:10 am. It took us about an hour and 40 minutes to descend. Overall, this was a good experience. We were just on time to catch the last bus back to Jungmun Elementrary school (if I recall this destination correctly)."
Amazing and Tough hike,"20km return, 8 to 10 hours hiking (be there really early in the morning - around 7-8am), some steep parts, beautiful views and pics, bring water and food (they sell only water and noodles up there) highly recommended for hike lovers. Best thing to do in Jeju!"
"Great hike, but try to get lucky with the weather","Mt Halla is known as Korea's jewel. It is its highest peak. And well worth the trip to Jeju. We left Seagwipo very early (around 7 am) and took bus 182 (181 also goes there) to Seongpanak because we wanted to climb up to the peak. We got to the mountain around 7:45 and started the hike. The weather was super nice when we left, and we planned it that way, because we wanted to at least get some nice views of the city, and while at the summit. This is a long day of hiking, so be prepared. Bring snacks (and a trash bag, because you have to carry everything back down), and water. There are 2 checkpoints along the way that have bathrooms. The last checkpoint sells ramen for about 1500w with hot water. This is the checkpoint you have to get to before 12:30. We made it there around 11, and up to the summit before noon On the Seongpanak trail, there is also a lake with an observatory that's worth the detour.The last part of the hike up to the summit is pretty steep and rocky, so watch your footing, especially because you might be tired from walking up. Wear adequate footwear, make sure they are sturdy and comfy!Unfortunately, we didn't get that lucky with the weather as it because overcast as we were getting up there. I guess it really depends on your luck (the next day, it was super clear! Damn you Mt Halla!!) hahaha.We took the same trail down (from the summit, there is another trail, but no buses stop there. And this is where your comfy shoes are a must. The hike up was not bad, but the hike down, was torture! Our feet kept hitting the front of our hiking shoes, so we were bruised and hurt by the time the hike was done. We were also sore for the next 2 days (and we're pretty sporty, but we rarely walk for 8 hours) Overall, it's a great hike. The trail up is covered by trees, so it is cooler than it seems, but there are still some great views, especially with the fall foliage. We'd be surprised at the range of people walking the trail, old and young love to hike up this trail, and we understand why!"
stunning view,"really enjoy the hike up and down the volcano.love the fall color changes along, the climb has many stairs up and down but really beautiful view of jeju at the summit and the crater. "
Eoseungsaengak Trail,"Hallasan is the main attraction of Jeju Island so even though we are not hiker, we need to have our feet on the mountain. We took the easiest trail: Eoseungsaengak Trail, only 1.3km. This trail does not lead to the summit. We spent about 1 hour to reach Eoseungsangak Peak, it was very windy when we got there. But we glad we did it."
Clean air,"Went on a rainy day and still managed to climb a trail at 1169m high. Wind at the top was strong and couldn't see anything. Air is very clean, we want to bottle it. "
Everyone Has To Do At Least Once,"If you live on Jeju you have to do it at least once. I'm from the West where the mountains are huge so, when I saw Hallasan it looked like a piece of cake. How wrong I was. Mountain trails in the West take you up by switchbacks but the tail up Hallasan goes straight up and straight down. There are no switchbacks. Only about a million steps to climb. I'm not saying that there is anything wrong with that......just be prepared. Start early and take water.When I went up I thought I was going to die. It didn't help that there was this grandpa in flip-flops who passed me on the way up and then he passed me again as I was still on my way up and he was coming down and then he passed me again going up as I was still on my way up. How embarrassing was that?????? Very embarrassing!As far as the climb went, it was great. I felt like two cent going up but once on top I felt like a million bucks. Clean air and blue sky. Views of the whole island.One good thing about going down is that it's all down hill. I do a lot of complaining about it but I've been up there five times now so there must be something I love about it.If you do go up and you see that grandpa tell him hi from me. He passed me so many times I feel like I know him. ;)"
Amazing ANY time of year,"Halla mountain - Halla san (san means mountain) is spectacular in autumn with every hue of orange, red and gold. In spring it is the best time to climb the different trails but you must leave early enough to get to the top! Winter is a wonderland of white but hiking is trickier!"
Long hike but well worth it!,"After reading quite a few reviews on lHallasan trails, I finally decided to have a go at it. I left early to start the hike on Gwaneumsa just before 7.00am. I actually got there by taxi from sunrise peak, seongsan as there is no bus arriving there. It costed me 35000won. On arrival, the place was deserted, so I started my walk. The first part is throught the forest so you don't get to see any scenery. Once you reach the last shelter then it opens up and the view is amazing. From there you have still a good climb to the top (the thoughest part actually). On the top you can see the crater and if it has been raining the lake inside. I went down the second trails called seongpanak which is said to be easier. This one is a bit boring in regards to scenery because you are always in the forest.All in all it took me 6h45 to get to the top and back which is around 18km. The up trail is pretty challenging and I would recommend people the be quite fit to take it the down trails is a challenge to your ankles and knees as the path is covered in huge stone so be careful not the twist anything. On the up trails you will find a water spring almost at the top, no food and no other water poitn apart from that. On the down trail the is a shelter serving pot noodle. On arriving down at seongpanak there was a few taxi waiting so I managed to get back to the hotel. There is also a shop that sells drink, food and rent shoes.My reco is to start early in the morning to avoid too many people. Get plenty of water (I got 1l and it wasn't enough). Good shoes are a must. And one moto : slowly but surly! Don't rush it as you will suffer on the way down. Appreciate the trail. Be careful though that at 12h30 they will stop you at the shelter from gwaneumsa so you need to go pass this before and you need to leave the top before 14h to make it down before closing time. I really enjoyed it as a challenge 1300m climb from 650m to 1950m. "
Be prepared!! ,So we did minimum research on this thinking that the trip up would be somewhat difficult but we were way off that. We made it to the top but we had to push through it. Highly recommend bringing lots of water and snacks.
An interesting hiking day,"People who visiting Jeju island is to see its nature (except those to Casino), Hallasan is a must go to me. Together with the family, we opted for the route of Yeongsil (shorter though not to the top and unable to see the crater), where we could easily accessed by self driving from Seogwipo city. Along the hiking, we experienced the sub tropical environment in the bottom, then a much cooler environment after 1.5km of steep uphill. The view is great though not fantastic, we spotted few wild deers having grass in the mountain. The first 2-3 km was quite steep but mostly on boardwalk and constructed staircases, the last 1-2 km was rather flat.We ended in the point with toilet and food supply and then back down on the same route, due to the last section was closed. An interesting hiking day to experience different climate, weather condition, meet locals, spot the wild animal, and do physical exercise."
Allways a good hike and a good view,"Halla mountain can be hiked in 3-5 hours easily. I have hiked the Seongpanak Trail (on the east side) and the Gwaneumsa Trail (on the north side). These are the two trails that go all the way up to the summit. If you are fit, these runnable, but Geaneumsa trail especially gets very steep at the end. Get to your trail of choice early to miss the crowds, and also note that the half way points of each trail close around 12 (depending on the time of year it is sometimes 12:30). Een when it is foggy it is beautiful, but, of course, it is best when you can see clearly down to the crater lake and across off of Jeju to the ocean. Pack a lunch and enjoy it on top of the mountain! (Or instant ramen is the traditional food to pack).My favorite time to go is in winter when the top of the mountain is covered in a few feet of snow! Make sure to bring crampons for your shoes (simple ones are OK, you aren't hiking K2!)"
Difficult to climb. Not worth visiting if not get to the top,"There is not much to see on the way to the top. Remember it's a 19k hiking and you need to use your time wisely in a day. We went on a cloudy day. It wasn't too hot but the hiking was difficult with rocks covering most of the roads. So get yourself a real pair of hiking shoes! My feet got hurt and it was slippery after rain. Some parts have stairs, which are highly appreciated... The top view was great but maybe it was dry, we did not see water in the crate. Spring and Fall might have more to see. My friend and my legs have been hurting since we accomplished it... "
Hot but worth it!,The walk started off beautifully with the canopy of the forest providing coolness against the heat of the day. It was an easy walk through this section and very pretty. Once you leave the canopy though the walk was extremely tough and hot. If you come prepared with lots of water and take regular breaks the views are well worth the effort. It does get pretty busy in sections so watch what you are doing. Stunning scenery is the reward for your efforts.
not luck on bad weather,"one of major place in jeju should be hallasan but since that in rainy season also jeju weather was quite varied, finally we selected a bad weather for hiking by bad luck. we don't go to summit but Yeongsil trail up and Eorimok trail down.however, rain and fog we don't see anything but just some trees & grass also two crows. trail was easy & basic stuff also well enough."
Hallasan,"If the weather's bad come prepared.If the weather's good enjoy the views.Enjoyed my hike but it can be a bit of a highway at times dur to popularity.Cell phone tower on top of 2nd highest mtn was odd but hey, good coverage."
Excellent on a clear day.,"A stunning view of the surrounding can be had on a clear day, but if the clouds are in then the view is not so good. A typical national park with beautiful surroundings to enjoy, trails, hikes and scenery. Not for the faint hearted and can be very tiring if fitness levels are an issue. Take plenty to drink and worth the climb once y ou get there!"
Overrated Mountain with very little to see along the way to the summit,"Disclaimer: Not a seasoned/experienced hiker. Was done on a cloudy day with a scattered drizzles.I had high expectations for the highest point in South Korea and a highly rated tourist attraction on TripAdvisor but was greatly disappointed by the experience.The reason I am giving a score of 1/5 is because there is a long hike (approximately 3-4 hours one way) with very little to see along the way, with ultimately what I would consider an ""okay"" view of a ""crater lake"" up the top. In addition, whilst walking the unpaved bits of the trail (rocks, which account for about half of the trails we walked) you will need to focus hard on walking to ensure you don't slip as it can be quite slippery. This means you don't have the luxury of looking around at the scenery/surroundings while doing the hike.It is not that the view up the top is objectively poor. It is actually decent. it is simply that the effort (3-4 hours one way) to reward (the view up top) ratio is terrible.The group of us hiked up the East trail (Seongpanak) and went down the North trail (Gwaneumsa). The hike down along the North trail provided a handful of views that were decent - better than the East trail.My experience at Mount Hallasan was preceded by Seongsan Ilchulbong the day before which to me provided a much much better experience. The hike was a lot easier and the view was much superior, offering a beautiful view of the Jeju City skyline. I personally would highly recommend Seongsan Ilchulbong over Mt Hallasan and would recommend against doing Mt Hallasan, unless you are someone that personally loves hiking as an activity anyway.Summary: Long 3-4 hour one-way hike (7-8 hours return) to the summit rewarded with a decent view, with a lot unpaved trail which can be slippery. Not good for people with bad knees, those expecting plenty of beautiful views, and those wanting to enjoy scenery while hiking."
Cafeteria policy and sarcastic remarks,"The hiking was great. I decided to stop and buy a few bottles of water at the last rest stop/cafeteria and quickly used them to replenish my water-backpack. I then gave the empty bottles back, and the attendant said take your own garbage down! The way I see it is I bought the water NOT the bottles and I was in no mood for his sarcastic rude remakes. If you are selling food and water THEY not ME should have a garbage disposal system, even if it costs customers a bit more money. I found they were very selfish and demining to me, and I would not recommend buying anything from them. They only are encouraging people to pollute and dispose of there trash along the trail. As for me, I hid my trash in front of their exit door to prove a point."
One of our most memorable experiences from South Korea,"With a few different trails to choose from, climbing Hallasan is an experience I'd recommend to anyone visiting Jeju and wanting a close experience with its nature. Careful preparation of equipment is still necessary, as the easy trail was quite slippery even while wearing winter shoes. The change in scenery when ascending the mountain was magnificent, even though the snowstorm at the top prevented us from seeing the scenery at apparently one of the best sightseeing spots in all of Jeju."
Nice hike,Nice hikeEasy access by bus even for non korean speakersThe paths are almost completely covered with wood (parquet)
Refeshing and diverse landscape,"My family with two boys 10 & 12 hiked up the Yeongsil trail to Witseoreum and back down by visitor center near Eoseungsaengak trail. We made a mistake of getting dropped off at the ticketing office by Yeongsil trail and not at the entrance of the trailhead. It added another hour to 4 hour hike. But the walk was nice nevertheless and we saw a snake and a giant snail to compensate for it. Trails were very well maintained and clean. But be prepared for ankle twisters and knee pains. I sure wished I had my walking sticks with me. I had to drink some Hite(Korean pale beer) afterward to relieve some pain on my knees. My two boys had no problem for them being young and all. A little one did the whole trail on sandals but I don't recommend it as there are sections of trails made up with volcanic rocks. One wrong fall and one can easily get a nasty scrape. Oh yeah, don't forget to bring, snacks, bug repellent, bandaids, medical tapes for your toes and heels. I enjoyed the cupnoodle at the Witsoreum. It was only $1.50. I think coffee was $0.50 or 0.60. There are few other snacks offered at incredibly low price considering the location. They give you a plastic bag to carry all our garbage down the mountain. One thing I really love about this place is the variety of landscapes. It felt like going to several different national parks at once. Few things...there are no bathrooms between trailheads and Witsoreum. Be sure to use airgun a the trailheads to blow away the ticks and other insects off your body and clothes."
Painful after hiking but it's worth,"I chose Seongpanak as the starting point from 7am, I managed to arrive the top before noon. I took Gwaneumsa to go down. This track is difficult than previous one but the view is beautiful. Make sure to bring lots of water and your own food."
Hiking buddy,i love hiking and outdoor activities although my seminal not s perfect compare to my friends. Great is option trail for your to choose for the length of visit. this is make me can enjoy the trail to the Peak.Sure will challenge Halla again.
Gwaneumsa hiking trail: Ankles beware!!,"My husband loves hiking and the great outdoors. Me? Not so much, but when he told me about the opportunity to climb a very old volcano in a day, I couldn't say no. We chose to do the Gwaneusma trail (8.7kms one way) which is considered steeper of the 2 trails (that reach the summit). I was initially worried that I wouldn't make it to the top because of my poor fitness level, but we did it with zero meltdowns from me. For those who are concerned about the difficulty, ask yourself if you can climb stairs for about 2-3 hours continuously. It was definitely a challenge but I've come to love the mindfulness that comes with hiking. Although, my muscles screamed on the way up, I found it easier to climb up than climb down. The reason for this was because a lot of the path is lined with uneven rocks, so you have to have pretty strong ankles and good foot placement. I managed to roll my ankle 2kms into the descent. Fortunately, I could still walk on it (just!) and we made the very slow climb down. We watched as many people just seemed to fly past with their walking sticks and strong ankles (I'm so jealous!). Moral of the story is, it's a wonderful hike, but be careful!!"
Incredibly dedicated Park Rangers,"We had quite an adventure that could have ended disastrously for us but for the amazing kindness of a family that stopped to help us and the team of park rangers who helped us down and refused to take a penny from us. The trail we chose to climb was supposed to be the easiest route up to the crater lake and indeed, the trail was well laid. The different parts of the trail were graded based on steepness of the gradient. There were rails on either side most of the way and steps as well. The toughest part of the trail for us were 2 boulder fields that we had to cross. My husband got careless when we got to the easiest part of the trail, slipped & twisted his ankle. Unfortunately, this was close to the end of the trail, less than 1 km from the crater lake. We had to turn back and our daughter tried to help him get back down - another 2 hours when one is fit! It was soon evident that we needed help & soon. The sun would set in another hour, we had forgotten to pack food or water, warm clothes. All along the trail our signs with emergency phone number & a number to indicate location. But we had not coverage & knew no Korean to communicate. Just as we had begun to despair, a party of 3 ladies, a father & a daughter stopped to help us. The 3 ladies told us that they would alert the rangers when they got down. The father & daughter stayed with us, helped my husband lie down on a mat they had brought, elevated his foot, called the emergency number. I had some alleve with me & they gave us some water. The rest & the alleve brought down the swelling some & they helped us proceed a little more down the mountain till the park rangers (a team of 5) met us. The park rangers iced my husband's foot, sprayed pain medicine and bandaged it. A pair of them supported him down the mountain. The father and daughter stayed with us & climbed down with us. We could not have managed without these incredibly generous, compassionate people. The park rangers would not accept any compensation. They told us 'it is our job'. Regarding the trail itself, the route is absolutely stunning beautiful - rhododendrons were in bloom, one could see virtually the whole of Jeju island and the small islands beyond. Well laid out & marked trail with railings & emergency signs, warning signs everywhere. Our accident was due to our own carelessness. "
Jeju's highest spot,"A trip to Jeju's and S. Korea's highest mountain is a refreshing experience. It is still nice and cool in the morning up here but no snow in late May. Oh well, may plan a winter trip back here for a more thrilling and chilling experience!"
Yeongsil Trail,"Is supposed to be the easiest trail up but does not reach the summit. Although a fairly challenging hike for those who do not hike regularly, it can still be done, even for kids as young as 4 years old. Wear good shoes for hiking. "
great hike,"I did the yeongsil trail to go up and take the eorimok trail to go down.it was a good hike and the view was beautiful, take roughly about 4,5 hours roundtrip"
JUST GREAT,"If you are in jeju island of course you have to go there. A great ride, with some mysterious road,..may be some ghost... Up there get a jacket it s could be cold...."
Not to grear if not going to the top !!!,We had no intention of going to the top as it is a long day long activity . However how could we have missed seeing the HallaSan from up close. So we asked our driver to take us as far as he could . There is a driving spot till 1.1km where the driver took us . But it was nothing much than a regular hilly drive .So my personal reco if not going up there you can also avoid going to the 1100m point . See the Hallasan from far away. It's beautiful . 
"If you're a nature lover, visit ","This is a great place to hike and see lots of nature from Jeju island. You can hike up to Mt. Hallasan, the peak of Jeju or just explore the nearby scenery. In any case, whether it's rainy or there's sunshine, the nature is very relaxing and beautiful. If you're lucky you might see a white deer. "
Climbing Mt Halasan in May.,"This is a very well maintained mountain park as expected of any Unesco World Heritage site. My wife and I visited on a Monday and it was packed with people. We climbed up from Yeongsil and climbed down to Eorimok. It's impossible to lose your way. The hike is moderate and you don't have to be very fit to do it. Trainers or tennis shoes are adequate in May. You can do it at a leisurely pace or try to break a speed record. Hot noodles is available at the top (this is not the summit trail) or you can pack your own lunch and there are also a couple of water stations along the way on the Eorimok trail. The view from around the top is expansive but hardly breathtaking. Overall it's a pleasant and enjoyable hike.If you park at Yeongsil and return at Eorimok or vice versa, you can take a taxi back to your car for 20,000 wons."
Yeongsil Trail the easiest?,"Don't forget to drive past the ticket booths to the real start of the trail, we some some poor gits having to hike up the twisty road which takes 5 - 10 minutes in a car. Wear layers as it gets cool up high. First part is through bush trail, we had a roe deer come across 10 m. away. Then trails steepens to get to ridgeline, a little tough. Nice views and steps on the ridge, then another transition to a boardwalk through a tundra like alpine area. Go past WitseOreum to the 1700m. junction where there's a toilet and snack bar, hot cup noodles are the best. You can go another 2 km closer to the crater but why bother? Pack out your garbage. The man made plank trail is kind of artificial but keeps the humans on a defined path and generally keeps them out of trouble, all in all a good way to get the masses of all ages into the outdoors."
Great view on a clear day,"We stayed at Seowipo, near to the seogwipo-si (former) intercity bus terminal as we knew that we needed to take an early bus to Hallasan. We noted that we needed to reach a certain point on Hallasan by 12.30pm as they would not allow people to continue to hike up after 12.30pm due to foreseen danger. We took bus 782 at 6.00am sharp from seogwipo-si (former) intercity bus terminal and alight at Seongpanak bus stop to start our hike at Hallasan. There was a TV screen at the front of the bus that will flash and announce the current and coming stop in english clearly. The ride took about 30 minutes. The cost of the ride was less than 2000won and the bus driver could provide change if needed. We alighted at Seongpanak bus stop on the side with a hiking track. That track was not the track up to Hallasan. We needed to cross to the opposite side and pass the souvenir and rest stop place to the correct Hallasan track (free entrance). In the beginning the track was gentle and doable. We managed to spot birds and deer grazing around. However, the rest of the track up was pretty boring as there was nothing much to see. After 1-2km, the hike started to be more steep (as in more elevated with steps) as there were many rocky steps to hike up. There were two rest stops before the summit that provided fairly clean and well-maintained toilet with toilet paper. However, there would not be any tap to wash hands. Therefore, remember to buy wet wipes to clean your hands. At the second rest stop, raman, drinks and crampons were sold. Get all the supplies you need before hiking up as there is no shops at the summit. It will be good to bring tomatoes or fruit for the hike as those provide fluid as well as sugar (instead of salty food item with msg – this will make you feel sick). Anyway, you are not suppose to cook at the summit. Remember to bring trash bag to clear your trash too. From the second rest stop onwards, the steep rocky steps continued with harsher windy condition as you progress to the top. Therefore, remember to bring windbreaker and windproof pants as the wind was rather strong 1 to 2km before reaching the summit. We hike on 24 April with a summit temperature of 6 to 12 degree Celsius. We were blessed as there were no rain snow during the hike. The 1 to 2km up the summit consist of wooden steps that I found difficulty tracking up due to the wind and my lack of motivation (as I kept on looking at the summit and felt that it was so far away). Therefore, it would be better to just look at the steps in front of you and conquer those instead. When we finally reach the summit, we had a view of Baengnokdam crater and the surroundings. I was feeling nausea partly due to the fatigue as I did not exercise for 2 month prior to this hike. However, we managed to hike up to the summit in 3.5 hours. The wind continued to be harsh on us. Therefore we stayed for 15 minutes and decide to just hike down. Take pics even if you feel unwell. You will feel better as you ascend down. We hike down from the other hard track, the Gwaneumsa Trail although I was super tired. I did not regret that choice as it was much more scenic in comparison with the Seongpanak track. I thought that descending would not be a toll on me but I was wrong. As the track consist of many rocky steps, it was hard on my knees and I had to work on my balance too. The ajumma (they were over 50 years old) were able to hike way faster than me (in my early thirties). There was one rest stop only and we stop for the toilet. It was again clean with toilet paper provided. Generally, it was a descending hike with minimal ascending (with only a few flights of stairs up). We took 4.30 hours to hike down and I was totally shacked. The rest area at the bottom was also much more beautiful as compared to the Seongpanak rest stop. We wanted to take a bus back but we were told that there were no buses on Monday. There were buses back to Jeju city on other day from Gwaneumsa. (we noted that one of the bus come around 4pm towards Jeju city). We took a cab back to Jeju Dongmun Traditional Market for 20, 000 won. From the traditional market, we took a taxi for 3200 won to the bus terminal (bought bus ticket from the counter) to take bus 781 back to seogwipo-si (former) intercity bus terminal (the journey was more than 1.5 hours).Personally, I find the hike difficult and I would suggest some stamina training to enjoy the hike better. I would suggest to hike when there is good weather as I find the hike difficult even in good weather (due to the rocky steps). Having said these, I would still recommend the hike as I love the challenge."
Heaven sent - hot noodles in the cold mountain,"On April 27, 2017, We took the Yeongsil Trail up to Witse Oreum Shelter, have lunch there and took Eorimok Trail down. It was a sunny day with cool breeze, ideal for hiking. It was indeed a great hike, and yet when we reached Witse Oreum (at 1,700M altitude), we felt cold. We wished there were something hot to drink, and I hoped to take a leak after the last one a few hours back. Witse Oreum has everything I need, and, we found hot cup noodle sold in the Witse Oreum Shelter at a surprisingly low price! It was indeed heaven-sent ! Thanks to the park management for installing such a great facility."
Exciting and Fun Hiking Experience,"Took around 6 hours up and 4-5hours down the volcano. Really pretty with all the snow around, but on the way down snow started to melt and the ground is slightly muddy. traveled there in the winter period from December to January. You should go and reserve an entire day for this winter hike!If you choose not to climb to the peak, at around half way mark there is a crater which is around 3 hours up and another 3 hours down. The crater is filled with water but is frozen in winter. But i would recommend heading to the peak for the best views! There is a rest station at 2/3 hours mark with toliets and 2nd rest station at the 4/5hours mark near to summit. The 2nd rest station has a small shop that sells coffee, instant noodles, gloves, small tidbits. But best if you bring along some gimbap along to fill your stomach."
Seongpanak Trail,"I only went up this trail for 1.5 hours then came back as that was all I wanted to do. I took my time and because I did that I saw deer which many people just walked by not noticing. The trail is quite rocky. You need good boots and cotton gear as you get quite hot. (All the Koreans dress up in this synthetic mountain looking gear and my husband who went all the way up said they were all nearly passed out on the side of the track from over heating!) Some people had these HUGE packs on their backs. God knows what they were carrying! I had 2 bottles of water and dried octapus for sustenance and that was enough. My husband who went all the way up used 7 bottles. You can buy water at various places up the trail so you don't have to carry it all. There are a lot of people who do this ...or try...so it's best to start at 6am to beat the crowds. There is also a train of sorts that you can pay for to take you most of the way up. Not sure how much that costs. There's a restaurant at the bottom surprisingly that's all in Korean, no English, no pictures, which is odd for such a big tourist area. They have a beef soup, sushi rolls Kim bap and other stuff. I'll upload a pic of the menu so you can get a translation before you go there.I'm not sure if you have to pay a fee to climb this track as we just walked up but on my return I did see a ticket box so maybe you do..."
More than an afternoon walk!,"We decided to go up the Eorimok Trail and then down the Yeongsil trail and then catch a taxi back to the Eorimok car park. I had been told it was a gentle incline to the top (from where you can see the summit of Hallasan) but this is far from the truth unless you are super fit. If you are like me and generally unfit, it is a steep climb (it's very well done with wooden steps but they are steep!) Towards the end of the trail as you near the cafe and rest area it does level out. Fortunately there are lots of benches on the way up for frequent stops and it took us 3 hours to the top. About 5km long?The Yeongsil trail is shorter - about 3.7km I believe - but quite tricky in some parts as the steps are a mixture of wood and rock and you have to watch your step going down. The scenery is fantastic - especially on the Yeongsil trail - and if the azaleas had been out it would have been even more amazing. The whole trip took us 5 hours and then the taxi ride took about 20 minutes and cost KRW 20,000. At the time I said it was unlikely I would ever do this hike again but now I have recovered I think I would in the Autumn to see the colours and also maybe in May to see the azaleas. Maybe next time we will try the other way round...... Tips - lots of water, snacks, walking poles might be useful. good walking boots and a coolish day."
Must do in Jeju!,"Hallasan is the tallest mountain in South Korea and even though I was not in the best shape .. i had to do it! In preparation i got two bottles of small water, some snacks, and the clampers for the shoe. There is a store beneath the mountain if you forget anything .. like a hiking stick or rain jacket on a rainy day.I started at 830 am because you need to get to a certain point before 12:30 pm during spring or you're prevented by the park rangers from going to the top.The last stretch was pretty painful as was the last stretch going down the mountain.On a cloudy / rainy day, there is nothing to see up top. However, I did get a nice sense of accomplishment :)"
Yeongsil Trail,"We initially came here the day after a typhoon, and when we arrived, all the trails were closed due to wind damage. It was unfortunate, but we got some BEAUTIFUL pictures on the road along the way back of the fog hanging in the trees in stuff. It was sort of a spooky, peaceful atmosphere and we barely saw another car. So even if it's kind of a crummy, foggy day, you might get some really pretty photos. We came back the next day (after confirming the trails were reopened) and decided to do the Yeongsil trail. It's not terribly strenuous, and a lot of it is on wooden stairs/walkways. The worst part is going up all the stairs about halfway through the hike (which is basically the rest of the hike), but if you're like us, you will probably be stopping frequently to take pictures. Bring lots of sunscreen/protective clothing because a good chunk of the hike (maybe even half of it) is completely exposed with no shade. We stopped and had some obligatory ramen at the top (along with some mochi cakes that were kinda like protein bars we bought at the market that morning), then hiked back down the same trail, because that's where our car was. I wore my heavy-duty hiking boots for this, but if it's nice out you can probably do it in a pair of Keens (or similar), or even a decent pair of sneakers with a good tread (there are some parts that are slippery and rocky, so something like Converse sneakers or flip-flops are probably a bad idea. I say this as an experience flip-flop hiker, lol). Go as early as you can, because there will likely be lots of people out. I think we started around 9:30 -10AM and there were a fair few people, but not so much that it was blocking or slowing down traffic on the way up or down."
Long hike,"A total of 19.7 KM hikeThe walk in early spring will be having snow so be prepared.. Buy the show snow covers Crampons its a must , its a must , its a must , i went without and sliped dozens of times and injured myself once.. its snowy on the last third.. I hiked manytimes before in different parts of the world i go with sports shoe.. this one deserves crampons.. and maybe walking sticks as well.. Its long and tiresome. . But fun.. the view is great from up .. but make sure its not foggyat the end if u show them a picture taken at the top they will give u a certificate for 1000 won.. its a certificate of achievement really after a long hike. . Its 4 hours up and 4 hours down.."
Snow in Spring ,The view awesome ..we thought we can see flowers and all but what a pleasant surprise when we have snow view instead. Peaceful and scenary are so so beautiful
Beautiful!,We visited in the peak of winter so there was very heavy snow fall.We came quiet under prepared in terms of walking gear so the walk to the crater was pretty difficult. I wouldn't recommend for elderly or anyone with mobility issues but this is from my experience with snow so can't comment on the difficulty during other seasons. 
Short hike,"It was foggy and cold when we visited Mt Hallasan after noon.We only took a short hike from the bus stop to the Eorimok Trail entrance as I'm traveling with my families with small kids. It would be nice to hike from Eorimok to Yeongsil trail. As it is still early spring time, the trees and flowers have'nt bloom yet. Overall still a nice visit."
Yeongsil-Eorimok trail,"I hiked Mount Halla in mid-March 2017 with my wife. We hiked up on the Yeongsil Trail and hiked down on the Eorimok Trail. The whole hike was roughly 5 hours excluding lunch break. It was quite tough but enjoyable. The view was great from the top. Some parts of the Eorimok trail was slippery because of the snow there. We brought our own lunch because we read that the only dish sold at the top is cup noodle (this is correct!).Distances from the bus stops to the trail entrances were quite far and the signs were not clear or even non-existent. The lady at the information counter was unable to speak English although she tried her best to help us locate the bus stop.There was no garbage bin anywhere in the area. If I understand the signs correctly, we are expected to bring back all garbage."
Winter time views,Hiking shoes are A MUST unless you're willing to sacrifice your ankles. Crampons are also suggested if doing it in winter time. It says it takes on average 4 and a half hours on the way up and 4 and a half hours on the way down
good for place hiking,"For hikers this place was the good spot, but for some who doesn't like hiking you can still take pictures specially during winter and experience the snow."
Adventurous hike!,"Will never forget our longest hike in our entire life! Our earlier plan was just to enjoy the view of fall foliage during the autumn and it happened that Mount Halla was the only place... Did our homework earlier before our trip there so that we can get a perfect picture of the foliage in Hallasan. Ended up, we only managed to see a lot of deciduous trees, perhaps, due to the heavy rain and wind the night before our trip. Wrong timing... There were some trees along the Yeongsil trail (the route we used) but the leaves had turned brown, not the orangey red... My husband and I couldn't feel our legs after the hike and I lost my cap due to the very strong wind! Anyhow, the view was spectacular as Hallasan is the highest mountain in Jeju!"
Came mainly for the snow :),"Wasn't planning to do any hiking, so just drove to Eorimok base station to experience the snow and took some photographs, as we came from a tropical country and never had any snow experience before. Turns out the drive up to the station is very beautiful with the snow covered trees along the road. The base station itself is also nice for a leisure walk especially for family with kids."
Memorable Day at Hallasan,You should visit Hallasan once in a lifetime especially in winter after snow. It worths 10 hours of hiking. 
Nothing to see,We went during winter and there was nothing to see as the area is covered by fog and there was no snow as predicted by other. Nevertheless a cool place to be and surely more fun if there are snow.
Hiked it 19 times and each one was special,Halla-san is the highest mountain in South Korea and the middle of Jeju Island. There are two trails that go to the summit of the mountain. There are a few other trails on Halla-san but they don't go to the top. It is about 9KM from one side of the mountain to the top and about 10 KM on the other trail to the top. There are water sources on the mountain so you don't need to carry much drinking water. It took me between 2 to 2.5 hours to reach the summit and about the same time to go back to where I had parked my car. The trail is fairly rocky and vertical. On a clear day you can see all of Jeju Island and the sea below from the summit. There is also a small pond in the middle of the summit of the dormant volcano that is Halla-san.
Beautiful mountain view and a little bit of snow,"On the way to the mountain, you can see some horses, the kind that can only be raised in the mountain. There is some snow but not enough yet. "
Worth the hike in the snow ,This was the first time we hiked in the snow. We had to wear crampons in order to walk on the snow. The ascent was manageable and we saw kids around 10yrs old climbing as well. 
Hikeing hallasan,wow Amazing view in summit. I choose seongpanak route.. start 6.00am morning in jeju bus terminal bus number is 781ලස්සනම තැනක්. උදෙන්ම යන්න 6.00am බස් එක පිටත් වෙනවා. බස් ටර්මිනල් එක ලගින්ම මොටෙල් එකක් බුක් කරගන්න පුලුවන්. 12.00 ට කලින් කන්දේ මැද ශෙල්ටර් එකට යන්න වෙනවා නැත්න්න් එතනින් එහාට ගමන් කරන්න දෙන්නේ නෑ. ( පරිසරයට අනවශ්‍ය දෙවල් එක් කරන්න එපා. කුනු දාන්න බෑග් එකක් ගෙනියන්න)
Majestic- Eorimok/Yeongsil,"We hiked the Eorimok (up) and Yeongsil (down) trails. *If you're hiking in winter, you definitely need crampons.*These trails were stunning. On the Eorimok, we experienced surreal forest setting shrouded in misty clouds and stunning landscapes. At the top of the trail, there's a great place to snag some cup Ramen and Choco-pies. Bring a few cheons and you'll be fine. Two-thirds of this trail was in the forest and the last third was along a large plain created by a lava field. Expect to be amazed by vast skies.The Yeongsil trail was just as satisfying. There are sheer drops and exposed cliff faces. Most of this trail was composed of wooden stairs. If you're planning to bus in and out, make sure you start early. The buses fill up fast and the last bus back to Jeju-si from Yeongsil runs at 16:15 during the winter (until March). Also, if you're not exhausted, the walk to the bus stop from the trail is not too far (maybe 2km at max). Don't waste you money on shuttle service."
Great hike for the 1st sunrise of the year!,"Driving from the city to the Seongpanak trail is the most convenient way to do it, it's only 20 minutes away from the busy area of Jeju.I hiked the mountain at early morning January 01 and when i reached the Seongpanak trail the parking was crazy long that it goes as far as 1km from the side of the road. If you want to save time in walking you should be at the trail around 3am at Jan01. Anyway, the trail was relatively easy on the first 7km, it was cold around -1 to 5C that time, still manageable but the trail was slippery due to ice forming on rocks and the trail was covered with snow. So, to prevent accidents wear a mini crampons or a Yaktrak coil underneath your shoes.Don't worry hiking alone, you can do this without a guide, you probably are blind if you get lost out there. Also, the trail was properly maintained that hiking at the peak was a breeze except the last 2km of the hike. When you reached the final kilometers it starts to get steep, so take your time and avoid slippery rocks and you should be fine. Finally, the peak was amazing, you would be able to see sea of clouds if the weather permits. Overall not bad for a hike."
Gwaneumsa trail to the summit!,"The highlight of my visit to Jeju was reaching the Baengnokdam - the crater lake at the summit of Hallasan. The trail is superb with great views and different landscapes. The trail has 8.7km (one way to the summit) and one has to reach a check point that is 3km from the summit by 12pm, hence plan accordingly. During the winter I highly recommend good boots, crampons and sticks as from certain point it gets snowy and icy.It is a long and exhausting day, but completely worth it!"
Nice place to hike!,"It has always been something i try to do everytime i go for a holiday, is to go trekking in the mountains or forest. I went in late December and took a cab up to the start of yeongsil trail, and went down Eorimok trail. It was near a six hours journey, with a 20 mins lunch break. As i went during late december, the drive up the mountain area was really foggy and the visibility is only like 5 metres in front of us which is kinda scary because there were many windy roads. but as soon as we are nearing the trail, the fog seems to have been lifted due to the heights. Good info to know: Yeongsil trail have many flights of steps. Depending on what you prefer, manmade steps means relatively safe walkway but it is up most of the time.Eorimok trail has more stones steps and is more natural. But it could mean that it is more tedious, really depends on your preference.Lunch is ramen noodle at the shelter, they sell small snacks and drinks too. PS: As i went during the winter, the timing to enter certain trail is really strict because the sun sets really early like 5ish in the afternoon. So it is definitely a thing to take note of especially if you are not fast paced. Also during winter, along the trail, there will be snow left from the night before, and it IS really Slippery!! I nearly slipped many times because i was wearing a normal sneaker and not trekking shoe. And a really helpful thing to have is a walking stick! Other than that, enjoy your time with nature there!"
Eorimok Trail! On the must do list!,"My husband and I consider ourselves pretty fit people, we regularly run and ski seasonally but we were impressed at the older Korean folks who visited the same track we did!We visited the Eorimok Trail which was advertised as a 3 hour walk one way. This time estimate is definitely accurate especially if it's consistent walking (which we did with very little breaks) if you take a 10 min breaks every so often, it would take you longer. Definitely allocate a full day for this walk and start early in winter as day time is shorter and sun sets early. We started around 10am and made it down by 4.30pm with about an 30-45 min break at the top of the trail. Remember to bring your rubbish down with you, there are no bins at the top!This trail is definitely not pram or wheelchair friendly. If you have had any leg or hip surgery recently I would also not recommend. Even though this is an 'easier' trail the walkway access is not well paved, there are large rocks and very uneven surfaces much of the way up the trail. Near the end of the day, my husband and I witnessed at least half a dozen people needing assistance down the mountain on their 'conveyor belt pulley' which was supposed to only be used for stock to be transported up and down the mountain, but in these cases of emergency some elderly and struggling walkers were transported two at a time, down the mountain. I also witnessed an old man cramping up on his way down, but lucky he was with a walking group, so they managed to organise for him to go down safely.Like many reviews say, there are consistent reminders around noon for walkers to start making their way down the mountain for your safety.This walk was beautiful and we definitely will be back to attempt another trail of this mountain! We were lucky with the weather and there was no cloud cover when we went up, but got really windy when we descended the mountain.If you are driving to Eorimok trail by rental car and are using their rental gps, the telephone number for Eorimok trail for input into the gps is: 7139950 or 7139953, definitely go early if you can, otherwise like us we arrived around 10am and had to park at the trail driveway entrance and hiked up to the full car park :)"
Winter Wonderland,It was winter when we came so most of the trees at the entrance were naked. But people were doing their warm ups for the climb to the crater with the lake. It's the highest peak in Korea so it takes about 4 hours to get to the top. It was advised to bring a packed lunch. I recommend climbing during the spring though. More trees and flowers to look at during the climb. The park is a UNESCO heritage site so it is definitely well maintained. They also have a building that shows the different eco systems that can be found in the park. Not only is it for the physically inclined people but the smart minds as well. 
Must go,Hallasan is the tallest mountain in South Korea. Your trip to Jeju island is not complete without climbing this mountain. There are several trails that have different difficulty.
Best place on Jeju,Yes! I love this place for its natural scene and beautiful environment. It is really quiet and peaceful except at the base where there are plenty of tourists. Note there are several hiking trails of different distance and demands. Be sure to read to it and do note the closing time in different seasons. Some closes as early as 1330hr in winter due to early sun set. Most charged entries for vehicles into the car park. Small car (Kia Morning) which I rented from rentalcar.com was charged 1000 won (peanut) Put on right shoes and gear. There are air blower (See pic) available to dust off the mud or dirt from your shoes before u step into your car. Love that. Enjoy the beauty. 
Must Visit in Peak Autumn!,The view is amazing and lovely! Enjoy your long drive with scenic view and take as many as you can picturesque memorable photo!
Stunning view,"You have to go to Hallasan if you go to Jeju. It was the best scenery in Jeju. The route we took was the easiest one called Esoeungsaengale trail, only 40mins to the top. The view on the top of the mountain was stunning. It is really worth to go. "
memorable 11hr trek,"yes we took that long but it was definitely a highlight of our trip...start early, 630 to 7am would be good... as it was nov, we ended trekking the last part in the dark... a torchlight would be a good idea...there's a shelter 3/4 up that sells water and instant noodles...still some snacks as you trek might be a good idea"
I love it!,"This is purely an activity you should do if you actually enjoy adventures! The guides say to get to the peak it will take 4.5 hours, 8-9.5km depending on which trail you take. We took the popular one, seongpanak because there is a direct bus route from the Jeju intercity terminal (number 781). Here's my itinerary for the day:08.45: arrived at seongpanak trail start09.45: arrived at Sokbat shelter11.10: arrived at Jindallaebat shelter12.30: arrived at peakSo in total 3.45 hours including breaks. I had around 1 hour at the top to sit, eat, take photos, luckily we chose such a clear day so everything was so visible!At 13.30, you have to head down, staff will tell you to move. We decided to take the Eorimok route (8.7km) down and made it to the bottom at 18.00. Things to note:- you have to reach Jindallaebat by 12pm or you are not allowed to the peak. - there are no trash cans, so you have to carry all rubbish. - on the seongpanak route, there is also the Saraoreum Observatory (extra 40 minute walk) which is supposed to have great views!- hiking boots or sturdy shoes are needed!I exercise everyday and managed it fine. My friend who does no exercise made it eventually and was super proud of herself!"
Hiking during winter,We self drive to the base during winter and it was a peaceful and safe drive. Chose the shorter and easer track since we are with a 7 yr old. Roads are silvery so ensure you have proper hiking gears and boots. There's a small cafe at the base but not much food option.
The highlight of my trip in Jeju,"Needless to say, Mt Halla was the highlight of my trip in Jeju. There was a good mix of clear sky and clouds during my hike up and down and the view is simply fantastic. I loved everything and every minute spent on this mountain.I went up via Eorimok trail and down via Yeongsil trail. Both trails DO NOT take you to the peak but to Witseorum Shelter. There, you can buy cup noodles, coffee and energy bars etc. but there are NO DUSTBINS - you must bring all your trash down with you. It was crowded when I reached the shelter around noon.I will not lie. You do need to be reasonably fit to hike up Mt Halla. You WILL have to do lots of climbing on rocks and proper walking paths probably make up 10% each on both trails. Many people recommend wearing proper hiking shoes but I went up and down wearing sports shoes and had no problem. It really depends on your personal preference and level of fitness.One last thing, toilets are only available at the start of each trail and at Witseorum Shelter. And make sure you have plenty of memory space on your camera for photos!"
Awesome trek and amazing view,"What a way to experience another side of Korea on an extinct volcano. The view at the summit was amazing. Suitable for ages, but a certain level of fitness is definitely required. The park is well maintained and well kept by the government. However, if you are looking for something more unpaved or natural this might not be the right trail as everything is already nicely laid out. (You will never get lost)"
climbing fun,"In my journey, I went to the Hallasan National Park at Jeju. Here is a good place to walk with family, since here has a wide stretch of land at the foot of hill, you can just walk around the hill. Children can play in a nature place with good air. All the building and transport are so far away, you must feel relax and do not want to leave.If you are younger and want to see more view, I really suggest that you must walk to the peak by stairs, but you must have enough energy, because it is really tired. Take water and some food are necessary. After that, you can see a good view at the peak, just like stand on the cloud.Finally, I suggest that you will climb at evening because of the sunset is very beautiful. Also the weather is better to climb the hill."
Worth the hike,Something not to miss on your Jeju trip but be prepared when you go as the hike will be quite a challenge. 
A pure natural experience,"Hiking on Lava, Seriously. :)Watch for snakes. I saw two of them on the trail. As you climb up the weather becomes colder and colder so have proper clothing. "
Very nice travel.,Very splendid place. The nature is amazing. I had an indescribable experience. I recommend you visit this place.
Hallason Yeongsil Trial,"It was with much endurance for me to walk up the mountain. It took me approx 4hours to complete the trail. It amaze me to see many kids trekking together with their parents. U can drive all the way up and trek from 1280m. This trail led u up yo 1700m. It's very popular trail and many people trekked together. It motivate us to trek together. Up the trail there is a small house that sell ramen cup noodle, chocolate and drinks etc. Overall good experience. "
A rememberable adventure,Rocks rock and rocksWear hiking shoes is a mustDon wear any others or will regretAt least 4 to 6 hours requiredNot suitable for old if they have not exercise for awhileBe prepared for steep n road hikeThis is not bukit timah hill
Eorimok and Yeongsil Beautiful Landscape,"We rented a car to drive around as the attractions are scattered around the island. We ascended through Eorimok trail and went down on the Yeongsil trail. Both trail were really beautiful and serene in autumn. Yeongsil trail was a lot shorter than Eorimok however prepare to climb steep steps if you're going up Yeongsil. Both trails will lead you to the Witae Oreum Shelter. It is extremely windy up there so it'll be wise to dress warm. Jacket with a hood would be good. There is toilet (only one you'll find throughout the hike), resting area and a cafe selling instant noodles at the shelter. It is rather strange that the toilets do not have basins to wash hands so bring along wet wipes and hand sanitiser. We fueled up at the sheltered resting area. We took 4 hours to finish the hike including rest time at the top. The walk down was breathtaking. The trees were changing colours and you could see a shades of red and green in the landscape. It's handy to have some tissues in hand to clean your running nose. Taxi back to the Eorimok parking was a rip off at 20,000 won. I think the drivers knew we were too tired to walk back so they took advantage of that."
Beautiful fall hike,"Must do if you enjoy hiking! We climbed to the peak of Mt Hallasan, South Korea's highest mountain. Took us 3.5 hours up and 2 hrs down at a reasonable pace hike. Beautiful autumn/fall leaves starting to changing colour (we hiked on the 13th Oct). Despite what is advertised, there is a water station on the way up so you don't have to overload on water. "
Great hiking,"We did one of the hikes and I would say that it is well organised, sign posted and there is enough English on the guidebook.There are taxis lurking around the parking that will help you get back to your hotel. "
A steep climb but worth the view ,A was a very steep climb but the views were worth it. Be sure to take water and food as there is only ramen available at the top. There are also no rubbish bins so take a plastic bag. Try to arrive before 11am otherwise you may not make it to the top in time before the park closes. 
Amazing Scenery,"We went on the shortest trail as it was really hot when we traveled here. But the scenery is beautiful. The trail was not difficult and all the people we passed were very friendly! Would definitely recommend checking it out, but just be careful of the heat. "
Choose the day for hiking carefully,"We hiked up on a cloudy day. I really recommend choosing the day for hiking according to the weather forecast. The hike itself and the views and people on the path made it an unforgettable experience, but after like 2,5 hours of hiking on a really quick pace we made it to the top and couldn't see anything. The crater was filled with mist and it was so windy that staying up there would have been quite uncomfortable. It doesn't necessarily take 4,5hours to get up and 4,5 hours to get down, if you don't stop every two hundred meters. But make sure to get to the last milestone (the place to take a break and buy ramen) in time to be able to start the climb to the top.I can only imagine what the trip and the scenery would be like on a clear sunny day."
Highlight of our trip!,"The hike was awesome. Very scenic and nature at its best. There are a few different routes to the top. ( summit is out of bounds though) At the top, you can find a shelter with washroom and a small shop selling cup noodles. We drove there, so had to take the same route down. There are taxis waiting at the start points when we finished our walk(around noon time)"
Morning walk ,Beautiful and serene forest trails . Very good view but the walk up is not easy especially in a rainy day
Great views ,Leave early as the final path to summit closes at 13 30 so I didn't see crater. Path is very clearly set out on wooden planks and steps. Very busy too.
"Tough, but worth it!!","We took the eomorik trail up - the first 1/2 or so was a tough climb, but through the woods so it was shaded. The second 1/2 was in open space - mostly on a Boardwalk type pathway. The path is clearly marked throughout the trail and there are signs to indicate how far you've come and how much you have left. The view was just average. It took us two hours to reach the top and we are not experienced hikers nor were we wearing hiking shoes, but we only took one short break for 10 minutes so we were always moving. We took the yongsil trail down and this was much more scenic with beautiful views of the mountains and rocks. Most of it was not shaded and most of the trail had steps so it was easy going down, but the look on people's faces as they were coming up showed how tiring it was to climb all those stairs! It took us about 1 hour and 15 minutes to get down. There were no taxis when we reached the bottom so we had to walk 30 minutes to the ticket booth to catch the bus. Since we just missed the bus and they don't run very frequently, we got a cab to take us back to our car at the eomorik entrance which cost about 10,000won. "
Highlight of our visit to Jeju-do!,"Hiking up Mt Hallasan was such an incredible adventure - you really can't experience the island for what it is without giving it a go. The vegetation on the volcano changes as you get higher, ranging from lush dark-green forests and pines, to beautifully unusual flowers and scrub as you get closer to the summit. There are several trails up the mountain, but only two reach the summit - Seongpanak and Gwaneumsa. Seongpanak is the easiest, but is a long trail (19.2km return), whereas Gwaneumsa is one of the most scenic. The views from the summit really are breathtaking, and quite unusual if you have never hiked up a volcano before. Hiking up Hallasan was a great way to experience South Korea's natural beauty."
Good views after the half way mark,"This hike round trip, if stopping at the witseoreum shelter is about 5.8 miles round trip. But a better way is to go up Eorimok trail (2.9 miles) and come back down via Yeongsil trail from Witseoreum Shelter (2.3 miles) Constant uphill to the top, good views of the mountains and the city below after halfway mark, and clean fresh air make this hike very worthwhile. the hike up Eorimok trail consists alternating thick square studded steps, Boardwalk, and grave bedded large stones.  The first half is rather boring. You hike up through the forest and have a recurring doubt about the trail you have chosen. However, once you leave the trees, the view opens up and while it isn't majestic, it is a very pretty view to soak in during the remainder of the trail.  There is a lookout post that provides a sweeping view of the city below, and if there are low clouds you will be above it giving you an even more amazing view. At the shelter you can use the restroom and buy cup noodle soup at around 11am and then start the descend down Yeongsil Trail. This trail provides a view of the opposite side of the mountain and also has a lookout post that is rather awesome, especially when clouds are speeding past you. Since we had friends drop us off at the Eorimok trail and pick us up at the Yeongsil trail, transportation wasn't a problem. But at the Yeongsil trailhead we saw plenty of taxis waiting for business. "
Do it but the views aren't amazing,"I didn't reach the summit but hiking the Eorimok and Yeongsil trails didn't provide amazing views as far as I was concerned, but it's definitely worth doing.Take the 740 bus from City Bus Terminal to Eorimok (krw1800, 45 min) or Yeongsil Ticket Office (krw 2800, 60 min). Bus leaves CBT at 07:00, 08:00, 09:00, 10:00. You don’t want to set off after 10:00 as you won’t get back! Last returns are 17:36 (Yeongsil) and 17:55 (Eorimok) April through October.I took the Eorimok trail up (there’s an easy 1km walk from the bus stop to the trailhead) and reached the Witseoreum shelter in 2 hours, including stops. The first 2.4km are quite tough but it gets much easier the further you go. If you’re worried about your ankles then wear hiking boots but trail shoes are fine. The descent down via Yeongsil was a leisurely 90 mins but it feels like it would be a slightly tougher climb compared to Eorimok. There’s also a 2.5km downhill walk from the trailhead to the bus stop, so bear that in mind if you decide to start from Yeongsil. The scenery is much better on Yeongsil, although those with vertigo may find it tough, even with the very good safety barriers on the route. Eorimok doesn’t have those problems but the first 2km is under forest cover, with little scenery to admire for most of the climb.If you want to hike to the summit start very early, which probably means you'll need a car in case you miss the last bus back.There are clean, normal toilets at both entrances and at the Witseoreum stop. You will have to carry all trash back down as there are no bins anywhere on the mountain. You can buy hot instant noodles at the Witseoreum but you’ll have to carry it back down. I bought several buns and pastries at Paris Baguette for my hike."
Good hike but not a great view,"I hiked the Seongpanak Trail which goes all the way to the top of Halla Mountain. In order to reach the top though, you must get to the last shelter before 12:30pm. The path is covered with uneven rocks and stairs so wear good shoes. I really enjoyed the hike but was underwhelmed by the view. Most of the path is shaded and when you do finally clear the trees it was cloudy and grey. The crater lake looked more like a big puddle of mud.If you like long, challenging hikes then the Seongpanak Trail is for you. If you're only in it for the view, perhaps try going in the early spring."
"Breathtaking, Magnificent View","We started with Yeongsil Trail and down with Eorimok Trail which took about 2.5 hour each way up and down. The view of Hallasan were so beautiful at 1700 meters, somehow i regret that i didn't make it to the top of the mountain due to tight schedule. Definitely, It makes me want to go again to conquer Hallasan ! Top of the Mountain !"
Don't forget to wear walking boots!!,"Visiting Hallasan was one of the best experience when we were in South Korea in July. Weather was absolutely gorgeous there! So we thought we well prepared for the one-day hiking event, wearing normal running trainners was a big NO, it was okay for the first few hours, then our feet were felt like being on those painful foot massage non-stop for the next 5 hours. So wear walking boots if you want to hike all the way up to the top! Tips: * If you get there by public transport (bus 781), be aware the bus back to the bus terminal is 782... it seems strange, but anyway bus 782 opposite the hallasan park entrance will take you back to the city centre.* Bring enough snacks and water, and take a proper rucksack with chest strip. you can get instant noodle at 2nd shelter, but its also your responsibility to bring the empty plastic noodle bowl and some left soup down, It could be a bit pain to carry the noodle bowl with some oily soup with you all the way back.* walking boots! !* For girls, take a pack of tissue/napkins with you"
Stunning all year,Whenever you visit it is AMAZING ! Boarded walks in many places and rough climbing for the adventurous. Clamp-ons needed in the snow but trainers fine in summer. Views from there are wonderful :)
"Beautiful place to visit, ""Be Prepared""","Mountain HallasanIt was a fanatic walk ever, friendly people all around. Unfortunate in Jeju island, English is not a common language, road signs, information boards are all in Korean, mainly people speak Korean, surprisingly, you might find people speak Japanese and mandarin. There are a few entrances from around the Moutain, make sure you do your research.I believe there are more than 4 entrances. Due to limited time, I have chosen the easiest and fastest trail (Eorimok). You could take public transport or driving. There is parking 17mins walk, and payable parking 1000won, save your time. Be prepared below- Go toilet, do the necessity before you start - Go to visitor centre get a map and find out more. ( e.g. if the convenient store is open?) - 2-3 hours walk one way, the washroom only available in the destination. Choose the hiking shoes. (Bad experience, my sport shoes are ruined) - Best to start your journey at 8 or 9 in the morning, as early as you could. If you are doing other trails, allow more than 8 hours. Eorimok entrance, it took me 5hours, I took a slow walk. - Be warned after certain time (14:30, not certain), you may not be allowed to go in. - Bring a lot of water, or bring enough cash (drinkable water is not enough to supply to public), bring your own food if you don't want to end up eating spicy instant noodle.- Store only sell, instant noodle(super spicy), and spring water. (Limited to 2 portions of instant noodle per person) price: 1000won for instant noodle, 1000won for a bottle of water- Bring extra clothe to change, bring a light weight jacket. (It is a bit chilling on top)- Bring insects repellent spray or lotion- Bring wet tissue and normal tissue- Bring a bag for rubbish, smoking and littering are not allowed.The place is well protected, please respect :) Voila! Happy Journey! "
Jeju National Park Treasure,"Arrived in the morning parked easily, cost for parking at the entrance was 1800 WON and picked up a map. Make sure you wear good shoes -- preferably with good ankle support and walking sticks. The path is well layer out but does take some effort. We did not get all the way to the top as it was closed due to a slide but it's nice walk. Suggest an early start and bring water too."
Can be challenging,Place is very clean and beautiful. No thrash bins around so do bring extra plastic bag to throw your unwanted things or drinks in it. It is a long walk up to the entrance. Choose the path wisely. Not advisable for those with joint pain and old injuries. 
Worth a hike,"Eokimok trail up and Yongsil trail down, I really enjoyed the well taken care off hiking trails and all of the signs in various languages. You meet people all the time so no worries if you are alone. Must do on Jeju island!"
Climbing mt. Hallasan,We climbed to the top of Mt. Hallasan via the seongpanak trail. We are in just above average shape and we had no issues getting to the top with not stops in 2hrs 40 mins. There are three rest areas along the way that you can stop at if you need a good break. The last 1.5k to the top is the real shocker. We did not do our homework and went up real early on the morning and it was so windy and cold we did not stay long at the top. It was cloudy at the top anyway so we were not able to see 20 feet off the mountain so we headed back down. There is little to no people climbing the mountain at 6am but I'm out way down there was more people ascending to the top. Overall it was a good trip but I recommend bringing a windbreaker and not starting until around 7 on a clear day. 
Very Exhausting trip.. but worth the hike !,"We visited Mount Halla National Park yesterday, Aug 25th, and it was an excellent experience and great views!It is very easy to get there by the 740 bus from Jeju Bus terminal, now here is the tricky part.. there are several entrances and trails. All of them are intense hiking. Use comfortable shoes, take lots of water and snacks.. there is nothing to buy up until the very top, which is noodle soup, water and chocolates......We took the Eorimok trail to go up to Witsae Shelter and took the Yeongsil trail to return down and my recommendation is:Take Yeongsil train, the view is by far much better than the one from Eorimok trail.In order to get there:Take 740 bus and get down on Yeongsil ticket office (@45m) and from there take a taxi to the main entrance (there is a taxi that goes up and down all the time and charges 5000). Please take the taxi, otherwise you will end up walking uphill for @2km. Once at the entrance... just follow the signs to Witse Shelter. Take lots of pictures along the way!Again ... it is uphill .. from @900m to @1750m, with lots of stairs and rock trails on both trails. Up and down in @5 hours is an ok time.Enjoy !!"
"Pretty exhausting, but really worth it","As unexperienced hikers, we did the 9,6 km Seongpanak trail and it took us around 9 hours to finish the trail back and forth (breaks included). The view at the top of the mountain is stunning and very rewarding. The hike itself is not very scenic as you walk in a forest for almost 90% of the time (which is beautiful and relaxing though). We were quite exhausted at the end of the day, but it was all well worth it. To memorize this day, we decided to buy a certificate (which can be bought for 1000 won at the Seongpanak trail entrance). "
Rewarding,"Many of the paths are laid with big rocks, better to have a trekking pole (or even a pair) with you to keep your balance and to aid your walking up and downhill. It is not an easy trail but the view up on the mountain is rewarding. If lucky enough, can see sea of cloud hanging near the mountain, it's beautiful. The spring water is fresh and pure, and is a good source to refill your bottle before going downhill. It is really amazing to see the locals, many of them middle-aged, walking so fast and can carry so many food up to the mountain. At the rest point, it was a feast for the eyes to see the food they brought up for hiking - kimbap, jokbal (pork knuckle),...and many more."
Amazing nature and hike!,"We visited the National Park as well as Mt. Hallasan during our trip to Jeju-do. It is a beautiful park with average to good hiking trails. We took the long trail (Seongpanak, 9,6km) up to the summit, which took us 2,5 hours (i will take you much longer if you hike slowly and take breaks!). The view from the Summit was just stunning! Definately worth it! I'd advise anybody hiking this trail to wear boots or other firm shoes since the trail is very steep and rock at some parts. You also have to start early in the morning (~8am) since you have to reachthe second station until 1pm to be allowed to go to the summit. Geaneumsa trail is currently closed!"
A big achievement and stunning views,"This is super easy to do... From Jeju city go to Jeju Bus Terminal and the lady at the desk will tell you which bus to get. In this case, 740. This takes you to a ticket office and car park. From there you can get a taxi or walk 2.5km to the start of the trail. We walked and it took about half an hour (but it is all uphill). I would say there are about 3 sections to this walk:1. Through the forest - stream nearby and wildlife (I saw a deer). This is relatively flat until the end when you have to climb some stairs. 2. The hard part- walking along the ridge of the mountain going up the stairs. This is tough on the knees but there are loads of places to stop and absorb the view. 3. Along the top- relatively flat through a forest part and then open until you get to the rest stop. It is the easiest hike and does not go to the top of Hallasan, but it is beautiful and gave you stunning views of the top of Hallasan (which you would not get if you were actually on it). Make sure you bring water, snacks and hand wipes. The rest stop at the top sells only instant noodles and has no running water."
Eorimok Trail and Yeongsil Trail,"Want to do a bush walk with nice scenery ? Eorimok Trail & Yeongsil Trail in Hallasan National Park in Mt Halla will be a good choice when you visit Jeju Island in South Korea. Be sure to take a bush hat, sun screen lotion and bottles of water. Along the trails, there are a couple of water refill spots for refilling water from the mountain. The cheapest way is to take a bus No. 740 from the Jeju City Outer Bus Terminal if you stay at Jeju city. Get off at the stop for the entrance to Eorimok Trail. From there, it will be uphill passing nice vegetation & trees until you reach Yeongsil Trail. Follow this Yeongsil Trail, you may be lucky to see Mt Halla deer. Once you start walking downhill on the Yeongsil Trail, you will see beautiful mountain scene. At the exit of Yeongsil Trail, you will need to walk a couple of Km downhill along the road to reach the Yeongsil Entrance to get the bus 740 back to Jeju City Outer Bus Terminal. Bus 740 travels between Jeju City and Seogwipo-si and uses the same bus stop at Yeongsil Entrance. When you get onto the bus, be sure it is going back to Jeju City Outer Bus, not the bus going to Seogwipo-si.[ The walk on Eorimok Trail & Yeongsil Trail will easily takes 5 hours plus. Air brushes are available at the entrance / exit of the trails ]"
Something Achievable!,"Climbing Hallasan Mt. Is one of my bucket list and It's in jeju island thats why i love jeju. The climb is so worth it and really something you can achieve even choosing the most difficult trail. You get close to the nature as you walk through the vast rich forest with different species of trees, Hear the birds singing harmonizing with the crickets chirping, Colorful flowers & sighted a roe deer along the way. The sweats you get from those steep rocky path is nothing when you reach the summit, it was so awesome! witnessing the wonders of nature & learnt some historical events happened many years ago. It is well preserved and well managed. Definitely will come back again to try another trail to see more what hallasan Has to offer. RockNroll!P.S. Going there must wear proper hiking attire that suits the weather condition.You can still try to hike even though you're not that hiking type of person as the trail has pretty nice part. Just be pro and you're good to reach the summit! Have fun!"
"A must-do while on Jeju, easy to get to once you figure out the buses","Staying in Seogwipo, I was advised to take bus 780, with the first bus leaving about 6:30am or 7am & getting to Seongpanak around 7:30 or 8am. I thought about taking a taxi to get there earlier, but I found later in the day it wasn't necessary. I believe it's the same bus from Jeju City.There's a small carpark at the entrance and a little store with a few drinks and snacks on sale. Apart from the lunch hut near the summit (which only offered noodles with hot water & bottles of cold water), this was the only place to buy anything. So carry some food and water with you, enough to last 4 hours or so.It's a fairly pleasant walk. Most of the time you will be walking on ground or planks of wood, and at times there will be nothing but big rocks, although most people were walking. I think I was the only person with hiking boots.Yes it can be very steep at times but is by no means difficult, nothing more than a series of steps. Just take lots of rest breaks and you'll be fine. It should take anywhere from 2.5 to 3 hours to reach the cut-off mark (see next paragraph) then another 1 hour to the top, so as long as you leave before 9am or 10am it should be alright.Coming down can take anywhere from 2.5 to 3.5 hours in total.I thought the cut-off point was strange, having a man in an office stopping people trying to reach the summit after 1pm, especially when the sun doesn't go down until about 7pm. I would've thought that was plenty of time to get up and back. That's just Korea and their over-sensitive rules...Not a lot of scenery along the way, but it's nice to enjoy being surrounded by trees for most of the way. For the most part it will be quiet, although some of the locals spoke loudly or even had their phones out playing music which I thought was weird.A lot of Koreans seem to be on a mission to get it done as quickly as possible, and they certainly have the stamina to do it, so keep in mind at times you may have to deal with people almost pushing you aside to get past.The view from the top is worth the hike. You'll be extremely lucky to see the bottom (climb Seongnam if you want a nice view), but you're here to see the crater lake, which is quite lovely to see when the cloud clears."
Glories of ancient Halla alive to this day,Gives an idea of how volcanic eruptions must have thrown Jeju out of the sea millions of years ago. Peculiar rock formations in a green landscape towering amid whispy clouds spell this Park. 
Great for hiking!,"For those who like to hike, this place is perfect! Make sure you have a proper map of the trails. Went during March so it was chilly and drizzled a bit but the climb was worth it when we saw the view from the top."
Mountain hike,"They say it takes 30 minutes to go up the trail but if you are physically fit, you can do it in less duration. It is worth the hike. "
Challenging: Not so easy!!!,"We took the Seongpanak trail since we wanted to go to the top. Believe me it's not easy! It is 9.6 km long (one way) and there are signs all along stating how far you have come. But the path, well its not a path, extremely rocky and uneven. It gets difficult as you climb higher. You need to reach the last shelter before 1 pm (in summers) if you want to go to the top. But nobody tells you, until you reach there, that you have to start climbing down by 2.30 because they close it and you cannot view the crater if you reach after that. I took us little more than 2 hours to climb the last stretch and we reached just on time. On the way back, we just stopped for a few mins and then we were completely alone! It was scary because it was getting dark and there was nobody at all. I don;t know whether it is safe after dark or not but I am sure it would be almost impossible to climb down after that. So please start early. I think the maintenance should be improved even if that means charging an entrance fee. The guy at the last shelter was closing at 4 pm and we had to request him for water on our way back. It took us more than 9 hours to complete the trek. Take lots and lots of water and some food also. Not for people with knee problems or not so active lifestyle. The view at the top was no doubt beautiful and you can see the volcano crater but you can also see the crater at Ilchulbong which is much easier. So, if you are going be ready for a challenge and reconsider your decision if you are not used to walking and hiking!"
Up with Eorimok trail and down with Yeongsil Trail,"I went trekking in Hallasan on 4 July 2016. The weather was not so good that day, sunny in the city but rainy, windy and very foggy in the mountains. It's better to do the trekking in Autumn. Avoid rainy and foggy days."
Beautiful Hiking Trail (Eorimok Trail) but be prepared to go uphill,"We walked the Eorimok Trail and it is a well maintained trail with signage all along the way that keeps you informed about how far you have gone, how far you have to go and categorizes the slope into three levels of difficulty (red=steep; yellow=moderate slope; green=gentle slope). It took us 2 hours to get to the tea house (Nambyrok Junction) from the parking lot at the base. Even though we didn't go to the summit, there are beautiful views all along the trail. While this isn't a mountain climbers kind of trail, it is the tallest mountain in South Korea. My legs were sore for a week afterwards and I am in good shape. Be advised: About 2/3s of the trail has big trees and good shade; there is no water along the trail; there are emergency phones every several hundred meters; and there is a single track 5-10m off the trail that looks like it would be used for emergency evacuation."
Breathtaking ,I did the Seongpanak trail on my own and it's pretty manageable. There are many koreans hiking along with you (there was rarely any moment that i was completely alone) even on a normal weekday. The climb gets tough towards the top but the view and sense of achievement will be worth it. Do start early and pack some food as you probably will get super hungry on the way down. It gets windy at the top so a jacket would be handy to avoid catching a cold as you would have sweat a lot on the way up. 
Foggy when visited,"I have climbed Mt Bogong in Australia, Mt Kinabalu in Malaysia, which were both taller than Mt Hallasan, but I find climbing Hallasan most challenging! We took the bus to Seongpanak. The path is all uneven as it was paved with lava rocks, all the way to the top! My poor feet were quite sore the next day. Make sure you have proper hiking shoes. Definitely not recommended for children or people with knee problems. It was raining and quite foggy when we reached the top, so we couldn't see the crater unfortunately. We were pleasantly surprised at the half way mark where that is a little shop selling instant noodles for 1500won. You can also buy mineral water for 1000won, which is the same price as in the shop in the city. I would have thought they would sell it for twice the price! They are strict about the timing of your climb. It was summer, so the cut off time at the halfway mark was 13.30hrs. If you couldn't make it there by that time, they would not allow you to further climb up to the peak, which is fair enough. We wanted to hike down Gwaneumsa but it closed due to falling rocks, so we had to hike down the same way we came up. Before you leave, you can always pay 1000won for a certificate with your name printed on it (at the foot of the mountain, there is an office near the toilet areas, where they usually collect payments for climbers that come by cars. If you take the bus, you do not need to pay any parking fees). You'll have to show a selfie photo at the top of Hallasan, in order to have the certificate. The person manning the office is not very good with computer. He took forever to type out names. Overall, it was an interesting experience. "
Take the challenge and go for it!,"Jeju is famous and ideal for walking, trekking and experiencing the nature. This Hallasan- the highest mountain in Jeju is a must for those who love nature and trekking. Views from high up are fantastic and the experience is well worth the few hours you spend there, but be warned as there are steep steps and sections and do taking trekking poles if you need them. We took the 'easiest' treks - Erimok up and Yongseil down, which took us a total of 7 hours of slow walk including more than 1.5 hr rest at the kiosk stop where these 2 trails meet. The kiosks sells cup noodles (hot!) which is the best in cold weather, and it's incredibly cheap. Do wear in layers as you'd experience vast difference in temp in the sun, shade, windy, higher altitude, etc. If you park at Erimok visitor centre, you need to take a taxi back from the foot of Yongseil (as the distance is some 17 km), but there should always be a couple there. I personally prefer Erimok which offers more shade and less steep sections."
Need second try,"Going to Hallasan by bus #701 from our hotel in Hamdeok area, through Jeju Intercity Bus Terminal, change to bus #740 departing every 1 hour. Stop at Eurimok Trail point. Walking from bus stop to the gate for about 5 minutes. There was a nice facilities at the gate: clean toilet, small convenient store with drinks vending machines, and police station too.Please be aware that ""sleepers"" are not allowed to be use for trekking due to heavy terrain. Including our son's crocs shoes. Unfortunately, the shop run out shoes stock so He can't join us.Eurimok trail quite heavy for untrained persons, we just only reached 1.300 meters before deciding to turn back to base.The bus #740 was picking us up at 15:35 back to Jeju Intercity Bus Terminal."
Yeongsil to Eorimok trail,"We started at 8.30 at Yeongsil and exited at 1 pm from Eorimok . Lovely walking and climbing experience. Fresh air, lot of greenery, lot of birds. Just us and nature and fellow hikers. It was fun. Very exhausting but refreshing.One must have good pair of shoes. It has lot of rocky patches.Carry water and some snacks. Sunhat is must. The trail is well guided with sign boards and emergency numbers. It becomes windy on top so a jacket is useful.Must visit place. "
Lava tubes/caves was cool... but everything else was pretty average,"There are two lava tubes/caves in this park. The tubes themselves were quite interesting but having been to other massive caves before (e.g. Mammoth cave in WA, Australia), this is tiny. Nevertheless, it is a sight to see.The entrance ticket is quite pricey but the park is huge... And i guess the ticket price is more to sustain the park. I believe some may enjoy it more than us..."
Amazing views! ,"Climbing Mt. Halla was a highlight of our trip to South Korea! We climbed up the Eorimok trail and then down the Yeongsil trail. I would recommend going this way because Yeongsil was a lot of stairs - I'd rather do that on the way down than up. Going up probably took us a little over two hours and wasn't too strenuous (though we are in good shape). The trails are very well kept and there are signs all along (in English) showing how far you've gone and how far you have left, and how easy/difficult the next stretch is. The view from the top (even though it wasn't even the top) was unbelievably beautiful! To get there, we hailed a cab from Jeju city. We just told him we wanted to start at Eorimok trail. I would recommend a cab because if you take the bus, you have a pretty large hill to walk up before you even get to the mountain because of where it drops you off. I think the cab cost about 15,000 won. The way home, we were waiting for a bus and then saw a cab so we hailed him. This guy charged us 30,000 won, I think because Jeju city was out of his way. Make sure to bring plenty of water - at least two bottles per person - and snacks. "
1st Fantastic View in south of Korea,I like Halla Mountain.This mountain is very high but easy trekking.And FREE fee!I saw many people (Korean and Foreigner)
Enjoyable hike with ending with a rewarding view,"We did the Seongpanak trail which is about 9.7km one way. The trek is pretty straightforward with clear markers. Not too difficult to summit at 1950m as the climb is gradual. Took us just under 6.5hrs to complete the 19.4km course including an hour for lunch and photos at the summit. For the first 7km, you will be trekking under the forest canopy. The view will open up as you push for the final summit to the crater. Great view on a clear day. Path is very rocky so do have at least a sneaker on to have a good grip, especially after a rainfall, which is pretty frequent in Jeju. Buses plow the route so it's easy to get to start point from most part of Jeju. (Do take note that you have to reach the 2nd checkpoint by 1pm during summer or 12pm during winter to be allowed to continue to the summit.) "
Beautiful scenery,"We did the Yeongsil trail. The first kilometer in the forest was kind of random. But once we got above the tree line, the scenery was beautiful.The path is very well maintained with boardwalks and handrails. But it goes up 400 meters in the first 2.5 kilometers, so it is definitely steep, with entire sections of just stairs, a little bit like climbing up the Eiffel Tower. This is not a relaxing stroll and you need to be in decent shape to enjoy it. When we saw it was 7.4 kilometers round trip, we thought it would take us 2 hours, but it almost took us 3, with limited rest time.The last kilometer to the junction with the other trails is all flat, with boardwalks through the highlands. We didn't try the restaurant on top.So all in all, lots of variety, beautiful bushes, beautiful flowers, lots of birds, nice rock formations.An absolute must if you go to Jeju Island."
A must-see in Jeju,"A must-see in Jeju island. During this time of the year, there are pink Azalea blossoms that decorate the mountains. Though the Eojimok trail is the most easiest one, it still took us more than 3 hours. The view along the Yeongsil Trail is particularly memorable. Hiking in Hallasan is a refreshing experience for travelers who would like to explore the essence of Jeju island."
A very nice place to relax,"Drove here with a driver and walk around the park with family in a chilly weather, not too cold yet not hot. A very memorable moment and good place to have a fresh breathe of air!"
Yeongsil Trail,"Very good hike, gorgeous scenery but this does not go up to the crater! Be warned only the Gwaneuma and Seongpanak go to the top!"
"Heavy rain in May 2016, bit rough to trek","May / June may be low season in Jeju, accomodation is not expensive. But,heavy raining in the morning, it turns sunny in afternoon. If you want to trek to Hallasan Mt., avoid go in May 2016. I trek the Seongpanak trial under heavy raining, it is a bit tough no matter up or down. The view is not that scenery. "
GREAT TOUR GUIDE ENGLISH SPEAKING MR ANN,"hello folks looking for a driver. Mr Ann is who i recommend. he is friendly with decent english. His english is optimal for getting by. Not only that but his charges are very affordable. He has many clean and nice taxis with fresh air . He is able to take 2 to 10 or more people. Having worked as a tour guide for 10 years or more with a huge diversity of customers from all over, he is genuinely a good guide. He drives fast but safe recommends cheap and good quality food. He taught us lots of korean jeju culture too. With him as my guide 2 days in jeju wasnt enough. overall like what many others said he not only proactively takes many pictures for us but also brings us to as many places as possible, giving us alone time too. He brought us to eat black pork, tea museum, folk village, mount hallasang, glass museum, trick eye museum, love museum, the maze place, a beach, udo island, and many many other scenic places that you can take good shots. E-mail address = ann9414@daum.netWhats App = +82 - 10 - 9233 - 9414"
And the Oscar goes to....,"You cant come to Jeju without visiting the main volcano which made the whole island, huge park, with 4 trails (different difficulties) to reach the top (easiers ones cant reach cráter) if you going to climb, even by the easiest trail, be prepared, is not that easy at all."
Straight Up and Straight Down,"I'm an American living in South Korea. On the west coast of the United States there are many hikes and every weekend I was on a trail. So, when I saw Hallasan I thought it would be a peice of cake. I was very wrong. It doens't look hard but the trail is cut straight up, (no switch backs). After reaching the top you know that you climbed a mountain and it feels good. You look back wondering how many steps you climbed.If you're going bring plenty of water and start early. Now I've been up about 5 times and I feel like I don't need to go again.There are tails to the top from almost any direction.It's worth doing at least once."
"1.3km hike up, if time is limited.","We want to cover a few attractions in one day, thus, we chosen the shorter route up a part of Mount Hallasan (can't recall the name if the trail). Glad, we made the right choice, 1.3km up to 1,163m in about 45min, not really scenic until you reach the top. The trail is very well laid, easy to walk, good for beginners and not so fit. Up, enjoy the view, photo taking and down, all done in <2.5 hours. "
Possible by 7 hours,We did it by 7 hours with 1 hour break on the top.We started 9.00a.m. We are o lot of students groups in the morning and you could't go very fast-be patient. Bring enough water and snacks.
Worth every step,"This beautiful hike did not disappoint. It's easy to get to by city bus, and foreigner friendly upon arrival. The trek itself takes about 10 hours total. My friends and I are active hikers, and I initially thought we could do it in less time... but with 2 shelter stations along the way, there seemed to be no rush. The earlier you go the better. You cannot go to the top if you arrive at the last shelter past 1 o'clock. It'll take you about 4 1/2 hours to get to that final shelter. BRING YOUR OWN SNACKS AND WATER SUPPLY. The final shelter has noodles and bottled water for sale, but that's it. So be sure to bring your own. Once you reach the top you'll be blown away by the crater and then view. Pictures do not do it justice. Be sure to bring:- food- water- plastic bag (for your garbage... there are no garbage bins)- good hiking shoes - the trail is very rocky at points.. the more grip the better- a hat- a sweater - depending on the wind, it'll be cooler at the top- a cameraHappy hiking!"
The views,Its easy to get to by bus but make sure you leave early the last bus leaves at 4:30 to return to town.
Probably need a little fitness,"Went up and down seongpanak. Went with my parents who are in their early 50s. The way up gets a little tough after the 12:30 point. We started at 6:30 and got to that area by 11:00. On the way down gets very boring. Bring lots of water and wear shoes. You'll see old Korean people wearing stuff you'd wear to summit some crazy mountain but just good shoes with good grip (not converse) will be good for the hike. Of course hiking boots would help. Things to bring: hand sanitizer, water, sunscreen, gatorade/pocari sweat if it's very hot. Bring some food and bags for trash as you have to take it all with you. Overall probably 4/5 experience but nice to experience with family. Probably not good for young kids - people with health problems die each year per locals."
Unforgettable hiking experience - Eorimok Trail,"Jeju is famous for hiking and its Olle walking routes, chosen to hike in Hallasan National Park as part of our itinerary. My first hiking experience in oversea and it is an unforgettable experience I ever had. Fantastic !"
Better in Summer,"its better to discover the place in summer, but enjoyed the cold and excitement, walking around feels better"
1 hour walk,For a short taste of the main national park on Jeju Eorimok is a 1 hour walk . Its easy and has a great view. 
Worth experience if u do it with friends,"It's about 1.3km from the bottom to the top. Along the way to the top, u can really enjoy the fresh air and the woods. From the top, u can see hills and jeju town. "
Seongpanak Trail,"We took the Seongpanak trail for both ascend and descend, took us a whooping 9 hours! Please wear a good pair of shoes as the trail is rocky, that explains why we couldn't run up and down afraid of slipping and fall. Parking is very limited there, we reached at 8am and parked at the roadside because there weren't any parking left inside. Beware of the time as you would need to reach the last rest house at 12.30PM in order to continue your hike to the summit. Great view at the summit but it was very crowded. Overall, it wasn't a very difficult climb but it'll take you a whole day."
"Yeongsil Trail Hike, tiring but great view!","For someone with bad stamina like me, it would take about 2.5 hours to reach the end of the trail.The tip is, to go there early in the morning, then you can take some leisure time to rest from time to time. When we're going down to trail at about 10p.m., there are lots of people coming up the trail and it is quite packed with people.For person with knees or legs or ankle problems, must be really careful as I fell down several times due to rocky trails at certain places. However, the view along the trail were awesome and it feels really worth it! The warm ramyeon at the shelter was the climax!I went in April 2016. The wind is super strong on top. So make sure you're ready for that. Hotpack, jackets, windbreaker or whichever deems to keep you warm. You may not need them in the beginning of the trail but you might need it in the end of the trail. "
Yeongsil Trail - A rather tough hike,"First off maybe because of the trail I chose the first part after about 20mins was walking, is really quite tough (even for a person like myself who walks and runs up to 3 times a week). The uphill staircase hike that took almost an hour up, with little stops. But after the uphill hike, the top is rather flat.Just being in the mountain, breathing in the nice mountain air was simply a joy.The only issue I had about Hallasan from a non-Korean speaking person driving to Hallasan, is there is no telephone number / GPS code that we could key into the GPS found on the official websites (whether English or Korean). "
Eoseungsaengak Trail,"It was a foggy day but we managed to drive to the Hallasan National Park. Once we arrived, the weather was clear and with a little sunshine. Perfect to walk the Eoseungsaengak Trail. They said it will take about one hour but that is really with no stops. We took 1.5hours. There are a lot of wooden steps up the trail and some turns. We saw mainly trees and bushes. Generally it was manageable. Do wear good walking shoes. When up the top, the weather was foggy and we could not see the surrounds which was a pity. Nonetheless, we enjoyed the clear fresh air and the workout. This trail is the shortest and the best for travelers who have no time or not as fit and mobile."
"Beautiful Scenery, Cool Trail","As I didn't have access to a car and was traveling alone whilst in Jeju I caught the city bus to the national park. This was pretty simple and the bus from the main bus terminal leaves every hour between 9 and 4 (during summer) the journey coat 3100 won. The bus stops at the end of 2 trails to the west of the mountain. (Eorimok Trail, Yeongsil Trail) . Both trails meet in the same place on the mountain and both give a varied, pretty and pleasant walk up Mt Hallasan . There are toilets and facilities at each of the trail tickets offices which are well maintained. The paths are a mix of steps and decking to help mark the trail clearly. You get great views of the different Oreum's (small volcanoes) these trails do not lead to the summit like the longer trails that start on the east. Ensure you have snacks and plenty of water"
mt hallasan yeongsil trail,"We took bus to 1100 road then continue up in a taxi. Cost 2 of us 23000won but i feel it is worth paying because the taxi took us all the way to yeongsil entrance.excellent climb along yeongsil trail. It took us 2.25hrs to climb up including photo taking stops and 2 hrs down eorimok trail. Do wear climbing shoes due to many uneven rock surfaces. To take bus home, walk down main road for 15mins, on the left u will see bus stn no 780"
Take the challenge,"I visited Hallasan in early March, some parts of the trail were still covered in snow. At the lower area I had some difficulties because of the melting snow. It's doable without crampons or walking sticks, but be careful. Past Witseoreum shelter, it's recommended to have walking gear. I have an average condition and I did the Yeongsil trail up in 2h15 and the Eorimok trail down in less then 2h. I think it's better to do the opposite. Yes, Yeongsil trail is longer, but easier. The Eorimok trail is covered with rocks, and if you don't watch out, it is easy to twist your ankle when coming down."
Natural wonders of Jeju,Unesco Heritage attraction. Ample parking space and tourist information. Worth a visit but be prepared for it. Be ready to spend a day. 
Hallasan-Seongpanak Trail(9.6km),"The trip up and down the 1.95km tall mountain took me the entire day but experience and view was really worth it. It would have been better if I had been properly equipped as I was in normal walking shoes and a small bottle of water while everyone else had their trekking shoes and stick with them which made going up and down more quickly and safe. There are alot of routes but not all the routes will lead you to the peak. Spoke to a few people on my way up and they shared that this is most tedious route as its the longest. There is only one way up and down which makes trekking easy for solo traveller like me.It'd be good if you can bring some food and lots of water with you where you can picnic with many korean families when you reach the peak. Do prepare to start early as you will have to reach a certain checkpoint before they allow you to continue your way up the peak. It was a heartwarming experience for me when all the korean people who walked past me would encourage me to press on and they would share they food around at the peak. Korean families usually do this as a family activity where the grandmother, grandfather, parents and kids would climb leisurely. If a grandparent can do it, so can you. Thats all :)"
Consider visibility if you want a view,"We did the Seongpanak trail in springtime. It's a nice but long route, and for 90% of the time you're surrounded by trees and forget you're on a mountain. The final section is steeper and the tree disappear, with views of the island opening up. Unfortunately, due to smog (I imagine mostly from China) not much could be seen, and you didn't get a sense of being on an island (the ocean could not be seen). There is a lake at the top and there was some snow on the mountain, so there was something to look at, but the overall views were a little disappointing. He hike is relatively easy as long as you're comfortable stepping from small Boulder to Boulder, not especially steep but more of a slog, as it is 10km to the peak and then 10km back. "
Good walk,"We went up the Yeongsil side. Lots of parking cost was 1800 won. You drive about 2kms after paying. Nice fairly easy walk. Still bits of remaining snow around. I could've done with putting my merino leggings on! Still, forced me to walk faster! Haha!"
Hike to the top. It's worth it,"Even with the crowd, it's still worth it. We took Seongpanak trail to hike up to the top in mid March and still needed snow sparks. Make sure start your hike by 9am and bring food/snack to survive for 8 hours or more. The trail is mix of rocks and boardwalks with little soft surface to walk on, so be mindful with choice of your shoes or socks."
Worth a visit,Climbed it now proud. Most popular place to visit in jeju. If you are climbing the mountain bring foot snow sparks so that it won't be slippery. 
Seems good place!,We could not explore it much as it was raining. But we still anyhow manage to see horses in the ground.
The no1 must see in Jeju,"We took a cab from Jejusi Shinjeju to Yongsil trail. Cost us around 23000krw for a 30mins ride. We started hiking at 1.30pm (trail closes at 2pm) and hiked for close to 2 hours up to 1650m. Total height was around 1900++ m. Didnt reach all the way to the top. However, the view was spectacular. Defintely believe it is one of the must visit places in Jeju. "
Amazing. A MUST,"When you get to the top theres the most beautiful view you will ever see. Im not an adult so if you are planning to go with your family just go, Jeju itself is really pretty but this mountain is exceptional, if you have the kind of teens/children that like challenges and adventures it is a must. I believe it is SO much better on spring or summer, cause i went on winter and the landscape is beautiful with all the snow but at the top its super cold and windy and the lake is freezed of course so you can not really appreciate it at all and it may make you think like you hiked all that enormous mountain(trust me the journey to the top is HUGE) for just a freezed lake. Anyway its really amazing amazing, but i personally hated the way down, theres a trail for the way down opened all the year except from winter, so you have to go down the same way you went up and im just gonna say i fell 4 times. Go on spring or summer."
Eorimok Trail,"Eorimok trail ends at Witse Oreum, at about 1700m up Hallasan. From carpark to the hut and back, including half an hour for noodles at the top is close to 4.5 hours. This includes photo times. Like everything on Jeju, this is a tourist walk, for pretty much anyone who can put one foot in front of the other up a very well marked or board-walked track. That notwithstanding, the walk is pleasant and the area itself is nice. In early Feb you will still likely have snow (we had snow from carpark to hut) and will require some small walking crampons to ensure grip. These are 5000W from the small shop at the carpark, beside the toilets and are pretty good actually. If you have some full mountaineering fangs it would almost be worth taking them for a laugh. We were the only westerners on the trail from perhaps 3-400 people and it would have only added to everyone's curiosity. Taxi from Jeju city will set you back about 20 000W and you can easily get a cab from the carpark taxi stand for your return trip. Hallasan is definitely the best, and some would say only real, attraction on Jeju and if you have half a day, then this is the track for you."
Must visit place,Its fun with friends. I went during winter and surprisingly it wad snowing. We did a hiking of 10km to the top and the view was amazing. Guys who ever travelling please carry proper snow hiking gears(if is is snowing) and start early. 
Beautiful even in the Winter!,"Didn't hike the mountain due to a knee injury, but enjoyed the atmosphere of all the tourists visiting the same day as my friend and I and we enjoyed the snow! Nice looking mountain, which is great for photos."
Mt Halla,"During winter time, it is surely different experience when you hike up. The view is totally different from summer. Can see icy plant. So beautiful that we wont forget. It might take about 45min to hike up if you are in good shape during winter time as it is not easy to hike up because of cold air."
Scenic Autumn View at Yeongsil Trail.,"No required permits and other fees before climbing. The jump-off, either through Eorimok or Yeongsil, can be easily accessed by public bus, so there's no problem going back to the city. We went up through Eorimok trail, 2-3 hours hike, then descended through the scenic trail of Yeongsil. Cold at 2C at Witsaeoreum Shelter, a cup of spicy noodles or a cup of coffee will be sure of great help."
Views to die for,"Beautiful place. Had lovely weather on the day. Many tourists around, but didnt matter, as the place was gorgeous."
Must go in Jeju,"This is a must go in Jeju if you are into hiking and scenary. The paths are manageable, but I would recommend proper boots and even crampons during winter season for the snow. It gets really cold, so proper clothing is advised. Just make sure you can take them off when your body heats up during the climb. We managed the climb without crampons (as the shop at the bottom was trying to rip us off), but we took the cheap option at the 2nd check-point of Seongpanak Trail. "
"Exhausting, but worth the climb","Hallasan is Jeju’s massive mountain, and was once a volcano. It peaks at 2000 meters, and from 700 meters up, the only way up is by foot, and you’ll have to drop your car at a designated area to begin the climb. The best place to start the trek is Seongpanak, on the East side of the mountain. Going up takes about 4 hours, at a normal pace, this trek will take all day. There are two checkpoints that you much reach before a certain time of the day to be allowed to go all the way up (and come back down before sunset). This means that you absolutely have to go there early. I was at the foot of the mountain at 9am, and I wouldn’t advise anyone to start climbing after 9:30 if you don’t want to be turned down. Also, since this can be exhausting, pack beverages and food before going up. There is a small shop at Seongpanak and another one at the 1500 meter checkpoint, but they have very limited choice. Just stop at a convenience store in the city before going up and you should be good for the day. The climb is relatively uneventful for the first 2/3rd of the way, with fairly little to see because you’ll be surrounded by vegetation. But once you reach an altitude of about 1600 or 1700 meters, you’ll start getting a great look at the top of the mountain and more importantly at the rest of the island. Once you reach the top, the view will be amazing. The volcano’s caldera feels like being on the moon, and you can also see Jeju’s coastline as well as its major cities, Jeju and Seogwipo. Absolutely breathtaking! Make sure to check the weather if you plan to go there, because the tall mountain tends to attract clouds, which could completely ruin the awesome view you’d get on a clear day."
Fun..,"As we booked for a tour package in Jeju ofcourse Mt. Hallasan will be on the list. Experiences the thin layer of snow on the park which is perfect for strolling, walk a couple of meters and go back. And yeah visit the museum to see some photo gallery. Its worth to see."
Delightful winter!,"Book the jeju tour under Rakso travel from the Phillipines. Visited mt halla on dec.31,2015. We were lucky as snow during the week was scant but during our visit, snow is falling and everything transformed to a magical sight.This is the first time my children saw snow falling. However, i noticed that the falling snow are not flakes but more like 'dippin dots' unlike the one i experienced in switzerland.Nevertheless, the moment and the view were enchanting!. Highly recommended!!."
A wonderful climbing experience,A 2-hour30mn climbing experience that you will not forget. I went to Hallasan during winter time and the snow makes the mountain even more beautiful !! I was impressioned that there were a few people climbing (maybe because it was winter time). This means you can take your time and enjoy the amazing view 
South Korea: Jeju Island Feel yourself,"Have you taken a trip recently? If you have not, go to Jeju Island in South Korea right now. There are two towns there with hotels of good reputation. Also, Jeju has a beautiful hiking trail called the ‘Olle Road’. You can see a variety of sea creatures and birds there.   Olle Road takes you to the amazingly nice ‘Hanra Mountain’. Hanra Mountain is a dormant volcano. Climbing to the top is a little challenging because the mountain’s altitude is about 2000meters.  Also, Don't forget to go the big shopping centers for foreigners. The exchange rates are better in Korea than in your home country. So change your currency at the Jeju International Airport, or withdraw cash from the banks.   This place gives beautiful views. Visit Jeju Isalnd. You will have very fun time!"
Most memorable Autumn climbing,"Be sure to visit even if you come to Jeju by only 3-4 days. Climbing is better to start early in the morning. At the beginning, some steep, climb to 1/3 after it enjoyed, leisurely walk along the gentle slope, wooded, narrow mountain road is very cool. Slightly sweating, big mouth breathing, anxious to put lung wash. I think is better shoes for climbing than sneakers because the rocks often. "
"Winter Mt halla, but looks like early spring","On Happy New Years Day, We(my family including me) have hiked Mt Halla. we expect cold weather and much snow but weather was quite similar to spring so small amount of snow there. at first frustration but as close to destination I feel happy about small snow and weak wind. If Mt halla was normal, I couldn't bear that situation. I usually hate cold weather. I post some pictures. plz enjoy these. "
Must do but plan ahead..,"Nice climb but plan ahead in case of rain, see weather forecast for best journey. We used Yeongsil trail, which is the easiest climb. Unfortunately we came during winter and did not have suitable shoes to continue our journey. We stopped after 1km as trail is slippery from hardened ice, and returned to have soupy hot noodle at the base.Will do this again, hopefully our next travel is on summer or autumn"
Avoid night time visit,"This is my 4th time visiting Korea but this is my 1st time visiting Hallasan National Park. It is a great park, however do visit in the day time. Do note, Dec day time is short...do visit Hallasan National Park early."
Serene,"The National Park is very peaceful by the time we reached in the afternoon. We tracked the shorter trail 9 stations point, as there is insufficient time for the longer trail. As we walked up the steped trail, enjoyed the woods, stones, freshness. Trail not recommended for those with weak legs - uneven steps. However, you can still stay at the National Park to enjoy the serene park."
The highest mountain in South Korea,Good trekking course in great nature. But no confusion that there is only one way to see the lake on the top called Baekrokdam. 
Breath taking views,Experience⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐Highlly recommendedWonderful for taking pictures and lovely views. Highly recommended for couples on honeymoons and hikers wanting a picturesque view while hiking and climbing all the way up 
"Great climb, however recommend not to go during the rainy season","Hallasan was a good challenging climb, with the hike splits into 3 parts. The first 2 hour or so, we were hiking through mostly level ground, some rocks and little steps. As we reach the middle ground, the trail gets steeper, more rocky and almost half are made up of steps, mostly made of rocks. Using a hiking stick at this time really helps in making the climb easier. When it rains, which happened the entire day when we went, the ground gets covered with puddles and pools of water, so it was extra effort trying to choose the rocks to step on to avoid getting our feet wet. Towards the top, there are flights and flights of steps, followed by a trail made of rocks where u have to use a rope to climb up the steep rocky surface. It was challenging but overall, felt good.As it was raining, we didn't manage to get any view of the crater or lake at the summit. But the sense of accomplishment making it up was great!The way down was more challenging as after a day of rain, the trail became wetter and what used to be steps, some were submerged in water. Hence, even with a good waterproof shoes, ur feet could still get wet. Also, note that the sky turns dark at around 5pm in winter and there's no lighting in the reserve. Hence, make sure u buffer enough time to reach the foot of the mountain before that time. Otherwise, u would be hiking in the dark. Nevertheless, there would be a ranger moving down the rail lines in a cabin moving on a rail line, looking for stranded hikers. So no need to panic. However, I would still recommend planning well, checking the weather and choosing a clear day to climb. Start early so as to buffer enough time to reach the 3rd rest station by 12pm, as anytime after that, they do not allow hikers to go up to the top. Think it is for safety reason to buffer enough time for the ascend and descend. Also, to wear waterproof shoes and if available, bring a hiking stick along. Do standby a raincoat in case of light drizzle. Also bring some food along. Though they sell instant ramen and some bento at the resting stations, it closes by 2pm or so and you don't want to end up hungry. Lastly, enjoy the climb! "
scenic,"just walking distance to Jeju convention center is a vast scenic place complete with flowers, stone statues and the sea!There are also nice rock formations.There is an entrance fee of usd2 but it is so worth to see."
Great place to visit in Autumn and Winter!,"Please note that in Winter (Starting from Nov), they prohibit people from going up the mountain at 12 noon. So please plan and at least reach the entrance before 12 noon! We arrived at 11 and we didn't manage to go all the way to the summit. It was a pity. But we were greeted with great scenery as we made our way to Witseoreum rest point. It's a UNESCO site, and I think the people there took great effort to put wooden planks and build the almost endless stairway for visitors to climb the mountain. We took about 2hours to reach Witseoreum because we were taking so many photos along the way (and the stairs are really quite tiring!) There's a shop that sell coffee and cup noodles at Witseoreum but there's always a queue to get the cup noodles because the weather is cold and everyone feels like eating it! Good to pack some water and kimbap to keep you full as you climb the mountain."
Nice walk up,It is tiring but a nice walk up to the top. Nice view all round when at the top. Enjoy sometime up there before heading back where many good restaurants at the bottom.
wonderful world scene,"it a must must to pay a visit while in winter season, it is awesome with beautiful snow and nice cool scene around. only setback will be got to try harder to climbed up."
Beautiful in the snow!,"Visited over Thanksgiving weekend and were surprised by all the snow! We had a rental car (with chains and GPS) ... 1139 was blocked off first attempt so we took 1131 and viewed the snow from Seongpanak Rest Area and we knew we wanted to hike the next day but didn't have enough time for the long trek so we approached from the other side on 1139. Arrived to Yeongsil Hiking Trail at 7:50 a.m. and had no problem parking at the entrance. Hiked/walked the 1 hour of 2 we had and reached the temple and entrance to the next 40 minute hike which would have taken us to Witse Oreum - fellow hikers informed us crampons were required from there and I don't doubt it, wish we had hiking sticks too, definitely not to be done in the snow with anything other than proper boots. It was a more difficult walk than we thought it would be, fairly steep toward the end and we were all down to long sleeved shirts even though the temp was freezing. Kids (9, 12 & 15) loved it, lots of stops to throw snowballs, etc. As we headed back down at 9:00 we started passing big crowds ... so glad we got out early and enjoyed the tranquil quiet of the snow covered forest! The road was just about cleared when we were leaving so it seems you can drive and/or take a taxi to the temple then do the 40 min hike to the final stop on a day when the roads are clear. Cars were parked for over 1 mile toward the access road so again, hit it early! Mt. Halla was visible when we approached the top - the first we had seen of the crater in 3 days there, absolutely gorgeous."
Worth the climb,"Wow. Just wow. We're beginners climbing up Seongpanak trail (longest trail, 9.6km). I thought I was never going to make it! But the people going down were very encouraging. Try to go early, as the carpark will be full by 9. Entrance is free, but you have to pay for the parking. Take note - you gotta reach the peak by 1.30. They'll start chasing people down by then, because you don't want to get stuck up there in the dark (trek takes approximately 4.5 hours one way) Oh, the weather was really good; it was sunny and not a cloud to be seen. It gets pretty hot up there so wear sunscreen. The lake was quite dry though."
"Definitely worth the hike to the summit, breathtaking views.","Took bus 781 from City Hall in Jeju City about 30-40min bus ride for 1300KRW. Had some breakfast at the Seongpanak bus station (base camp), got a bottle of water and a snickers then started the hike. Read that it would take 8-9 hours roundtrip, got to the top in less than 3, a very slow and steady rising hike firstly through the forest and later up the mountain. Stunning views from about 1800m and up, saw some water also in the crater, quite crowded at the summit. Ate my chocolate bar, took a selfie and started walking down. Total time return trip to the bus station was 6 hours. Best tip is to not pause at the middle camp which you must reach before 12:00 if you want to get to the peak, but instead just walk on to the top and have some lunch or break up there, you will then skip most of the crowd, try to head back down before 13:00, as you need to leave the peak before 13:30 it does get crowded on the descent and will just increase your time spent by waiting for slow groups.The views are spectacular, do recommend, no fees."
Autumn great spot,"As we couldn't enjoy so much autumn scenery in Seoul, Mt Hallasan in Jeju is the best spot to get revenge..haha..it is due to most of leaves are already changed their colour compared to in Seoul. The parking fee is KRW 1000 and we just enjoy the beautiful scenery from the start point of jungle trekking area as we are tired enough to climb the mountain :PThere is free wifi available and some restaurant in case that you need to fill your empty tummy.. :)"
An unforgettable experience ,"Hike the mt thru seongpanak trail (Gwaneumsa trail was closed due to rock slide) These are the only 2 trails that lead u to the summit. Took a taxi there, cost was 30,000won from somewhere near the airport. There is a bus stop at the foot of seongpanak but not Gwaneumsa. Overall, it was not an easy course for me and my hubby as we were not prepared. It's better to wear hiking shoes & have a walking stick. Do start early, I was told that it opens at 6am & we arrived at 7am. Go for it if you enjoy hiking! "
Worth a Visit,This is the icon of Jeju island. We went there on a morning and started on the Seongpanak trail which happened to be the longest at 9.6 km. There are other shorter trails available from other start points. The mountain area is pretty cold with some winds. I guess it’s the norm since it’s November.The trail is a mixture of proper steps and stones. I wouldn’t say it’s easy but it’s definitely achievable.A must go place in Jeju.
Yeongsil Trail,Climb up a little. love the view. easy trail to climb. the locals there climb it like a shopping trip or for leisure.
Beautiful Scenery in a very rainy day,"It was a very windy and rainy day... we could not climb to the summit but the experience was trilling! Recommended for trekking amateurs and pros! There are many coffee shops around the routes but bring your own food, comfortable clothing and decent equipment. It's totally equipped with stairs and view points but safety is always first!"
Nice scenery,"Along the way have very beautiful view especially during autumn . With Nice weather ,enjoy beautiful tree color during autumn."
A fab hike,"I climbed this with a friend and it took us about 4.5hrs in total. Easy hike but challenging enough to make it worthwhile. Lots of tourists climb this and they are mainly Korean; its a bus and popular hike. The views from the top are stunning, you can see the whole island almost, we went when the leaves were turning from summer to autumn, just gorgeous. "
Eorimok Trail and Yongsil Trail,"Amazing view in the autumn, especially u can see the peak at the end of Eorimok Trail and Yongsil Trail."
Climb to the top(1169meter ) to enjoy the entire Jeju Island.,"please take ur time to climb up the hill , you will never regret. the journey is not easy .you will need to walk about 1hour to reach the top . "
Must come,Must come to this place when you visit Jeju. We went here in fall and the view was astonishing. It took us about 5.5 hours for a round trip.
Very beautiful scenery,You should not miss Hallasan when you've traveeled to Jeju. The scelery is very beautiful. You can enjoy fresh air there. 
3 hours explore,"Drove to this national park as planned, the park are well organised with the different type of flowers and cactus, caves tunnels, animals and birds. My family spend almost 3 hours in this huge park. "
Yeongsil Autumn colours best in the last week of October,Yeongsil trail said to have the best autumn views. Be prepared to walk 2.5km(along the road) from car ticket office ( No 740 Bus-stop ) or catch a taxi up to trail entrance.
