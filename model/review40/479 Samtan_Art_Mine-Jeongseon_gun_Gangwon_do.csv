Descendants of the sun,"The reason I visited this place because Samtan Art Mine is one of the places for DOTS filming location. For KDrama fan like myself, I am so excited to come here, to see the exact location of DOTS. This is place used to be a coal mine, and now a museum. Other than DOTS, KDrama Phantom (starring So Ji Sub, my favorite actor) and Running Man variety show also filming here. If you are a fan of KDrama this place is a must visit!"
Just for Korea Drama fans only,"An interesting museum, it has a lot collection of antiques such as telephone, piano, masks, statues etc. it also famous for the K-Drama shooting place Descendants of the Sun. Might be interesting for someone, but also it's kinda creepy museum. Grade 7 out of 10"
For DOTS Lovers,"Even I'm not into the DOTS drama, but I enjoyed my visit to Samtan Art Mine. This museum features a vast collection of previous coal mine items as well as few attractive arts collection. The highlight is the room used for the DOTS drama shooting location."
A great place to get lost in for the day,My friends and I had a wonderful time exploring Samtan Art Mine. The property is huge and the sheer volume of art all around is mind boggling. We also liked seeing the pictures of when the place looked like when it was a functioning coal mine and the dress up room.We ate a lovely lunch at the restaurant on the property too! You really can spend hours here!
