Worth Checking Out,"We went to Miryang for the Holy Hai festival, and decided to check out the historical structures across the river. This and two temples were all in close proximity and very beautiful. Plus an old wall. If you're in Miryang, worth seeing. Bring good shoes for walking/hiking and be ready for beautiful views if you walk to the top. If you like historical sites, this one is great. Highly recommend."
"Foreigners,",If you have harf day plan of Milyang you should come to here. Milyang have some of famous confusianism recture hall(auditorium)and Pyochung-sa(budish temple)but im not recommend coming unless you are location resident. Busan or Kyeongju are much better than here.
Yongnamru,It is only 10 min walk from bus terminal and is situated at the center of downtown. It was amazing to see the legend of Yongnamru here at Milyang. It was a good place to walk and to rest. The view is amazing from the inside of the building. I heard they filmed a drama here as well. I think it is an amazing tour spot of Milyang.
The place of Arang Legend,"When I visited Miyang Yongnamru I didn't know this place was a background of famous Korean legend. But I remember watching the Korean drama, "" Arang and the Magistrate"" starring Sin Min Ha. Well the story is about a daughter of magistrate who has been wrongfully murdered by her stepmother. She comes back as a ghost and ask the newly appointed magistrates to tell about her death and asks for help. There is a shrine in Yongnamru where people come to pray for her. You can see beautiful scenary around the temple as well as learn about the Arang legend. "
