Lovely historic village to stroll around,"Fascinating village, lovely homes, very interesting place. Enjoyed our visit visit. Allow about half hour"
It's not too much impressive,I love its ancient. But it's difficult to find rightway and information about that folk village. It doesnt have exactly guide to explore this place
Its a scam,"Visited this place as part of a tour package. Its horrible. Phototaking opportunities are limited. The guide there spent 10mins running through various aspects of the village and the other 30mins hard-selling their honey, horse oil and supplements. Horrible experience and an utter waste of time."
Old-fashioned village,"Other than photos takings, nothing much. There are health liquids/supplement for sale but we didn't buy any."
Full day tour,Part of the full day tour Well worth the visit.Interesting to see how life was many centuries ago and how tough life would have been.
Educational visit,"It’s the filming location for a very famous Korean drama. We got a very knowledgeable volunteer guide who bought us around and explained to us the history of the area. Yes, I admit it is small and villages like this are dotted throughout Korea, but seeing as it is free, it’s worth a short trip to take in the sights. They also see some local products which the missus or the elderly may like."
Nice but...,Nice but nothing special. You will find these places all over the country. You can just have a look at the buildings and thats it.
Very disappointed with fake honey. DON'T EVER BUY!! A lot of ants around.,Lady in charge told us that their honey is pure and doesn't attract ants. We were so convinced and bought two boxes home ($40 each). Now we regret because there are many ants around our honey in the kitchen. And they're insured by Samsung. Truly. Very disappointed. 
Traditional Village Homes,"It was just an OK place to visit as it was part of our Tour Package. The old fashioned village homes were probably the only thing which was interesting to me. The lady who explained everything to us was very warm and friendly. Of course, at the end of the tour, you are brought to a 'special room' to view the products which they sell. I bought a bottle of Omija (Berry) Drink which was actually quite nice. I think I paid $50 (as expensive as it was, I just thought it would support their livelihood). She did not force us to buy the products but was very kind to let us try them all."
Disappointing,"We came here thinking it was the jeju folk village but it was not. A lady came to us. She cannot speak English, then she showed us very quickly around pointing this and that. Took us to a room then hardsell some herbal tea. Very expensive, we did not want but she was not going to let us leave as we were the only tourists there. We paid $50 for a bottle of so call cranberry juice....so be forewarn! There is no price list. We thought she was a staff cos no signages at all. We did not see any ticket booth. This was by far a bad experience. Felt cheated. We did not want to look around anymore so we left. "
Korean Folk Village,This was part of our Yeha bus tour - East Course - that gives you an opportunity to see an old fashioned village showing homes built of thatch roofs and lava rock. There is a couple that still lives there and explains their way of life and the way things were on Jeju. We also got to try a tea that apparently tastes differently to people depending on what they have going on in their bodies. I really enjoyed listening to them and learning about their culture.
A glimpse of Jeju tradition,"This folk village which has a collection of 600 years old thatched roof houses built using the volcanic basalt rocks and passed on from one generation to another, showcases the unique culture of Jeju Island. The stone statue of Harubang called the grandfather of Jeju and worshipped as the protector of this island can be seen in front of almost all the huts.This village is still inhabited by the locals and one can see them practicing their traditional rituals including rearing of the Black Pigs.By the way ,Jeju is famous for its Black Pork dishes.There are also sites for holding special rituals like praying God for good luck and health, place where breast feeding women pray for lack of milk etc.Our Guide cum Driver Mr Kim Nam Joon (+82-10-4616-6650) not only took us around the village but also ensured we had a good time."
Little to see,Not sure if it was because we were there during winter but the tour was really short and not much to see. 
An insight into the life of Diver Women,"An interesting showcase into the folk customs of people who place men on pedestals and where women does most of the chores, while being trained to dive deep into the surrounding waters to harvest seafood for a living. "
Super seongeup,When you go to a country you haven’t been before its nice to find out what it used to be like especially if it’s changed. This is the perfect place to go and look how it was. It’s busy but large so you don’t feel the many people.
Seongeup folk village,"Traditional Jeju folk village , heritage of timeless Jeju people living special roof architure . Famous Korea film drama site . Worthwhile to travel back to old times"
"BCT-Touristik
Visiting Espescially Your Coffee Shop",How Nice to see A Person That is Reading some Stuff in Such alonly Area Like the Village On This CLOUDS Lights Day.... So You Show me Your Fingers so small and Little... I Should Know... You doesnt Speak.... Spock at the Moment... But Your mean ins Not embarearsing But A Little Bit Sad....so I Send on you Nice Picture to wish A Better Day.. To Your Coffee Shop
Stage for pushing overpriced products ,"Against the warnings we ended up in this village after visiting the Kim Younggap Gallery (highly recommended) and getting bored of waiting for the right bus. This ""village"" is not much more than some normal village with a few thatched roofs, interiors setup purely for presenting products. We sneaked in and out after a few snaps (luckily it was only 2 of us) only to have a woman literally running after us with a small 25000 krw box of blueberry pills. Avoid it, especially with a group or day trip! "
Well executed,Seongeup Folk Village - As a rule of thumb I actually advise people to go and explore the world outside.
Great Look at Korean History,"Spend a couple hours here walking through the village and seeing traditional Korean way of life. There isn’t much interaction with anything outside of the performance they have, which is 2-3 times a day and with the vendors. They do offer horse back riding here and you can also have photos taken in a hanbok. "
Small folk village,This is a small folk village and limited information. The local man was lovely but there is not much to see
A ‘real’ folk village,"This is a real village with households living inside, opposite from folk villages built in museums. In fact, the people live there are mainly the haenyeo (women divers) - there is a museum for them in the east coast of Jeju. There is no entrance fee, so the village depends on the sale of souvenirs, basically the blueberries fermented drink and the organic skin creams. A volunteer will assist you to walk around the town, which is very helpful. A site note is that it is often used as a movie set, for example for the movie entitled Dae Jang Gum. "
Historic tour,"The filming location of a period Korean drama series, this place is reputed a well preserved village with part of the original city walls, official houses and commoners houses still intact. Several families still live here to maintain the place. Worth the trip if you are into this kind of things. "
Folk village exploration ,A place where you can visit to see traditional houses. The park is pretty big and takes 2 hrs to complete walking around. It’s quite informative if u are interested in folk culture.
A traditional village with modern technology,"It is one of the few villages that still exist on Jeju with complete retention of the traditional houses. The villagers still live in these houses but with modernized technology. They no longer uses the open air toilets, rearing black pigs and using electricity for lights, television and wifi. This is also the village that Dae Chang Guem were filmed in the early 2000s. Interesting to walk in the village as if we have travelled the time back in the past."
Interesting village,"People still live here! There was no admission fee. We drove right in and walked around. Obviously, the biggest thing is the roofs which are replaced every year. You still have the stone walls and the entry gate. We saw several people who still live here but didn’t interact with any of them. The village was a convenient stop on our way back from the eastern side of the island. I wouldn’t make a special trip to see it but it’s certainly worth 20-30 minutes if it’s on your way."
Surprised by the mixed reviews,"I went with the Yeha Bus Tour so my experience may have been better than if I had simply driven there. I found the tour informative. It's not a reproduction it dates back over a hundred years, homes having passed down from generation to generation. A few have been kept original for tourist. Most of the homes continue to evolve and have electricity and modern comforts. People live there and largely ignore the tourist."
Not really my thing - but some people might find it interesting,"The Seongeup Folk Village was a walled-in village in the southeast of the island where stone homes showed the construction, culture and lifestyle of the island’s people long ago.Obviously, Jeju wants to maintain some type of historical reference to the old lifestyle. Our tour guide made it interesting by talking about some practical aspects of the design of the huts (how it was heated, how it was built, etc), but this just wasn't my thing. In fact, several families that help with the upkeep of the huts actually live in other huts in the community. That said, those huts have modern adjustments like windows, electric power, etc so even they have moved beyond the ""old ways"". The village had a few shops and a restroom and outside the village was a convenience store with drinks available and another restroom. For me, the bottom line was - I would have preferred to spend the time at a natural landmark (waterfall, cave, hiking trail, etc) instead of doing this, but it was part of an all day tour. There are simply too many other options to see in Jeju for this to make it to the top of the list, unless it is your ""thing""."
Artificial ,Not a real village and no real people living it is a copy made for tourists it did not impress us withe the way Korean villagers are living
"If you’re on a cruise, before you book the excursion...","We were cruising the Far East and stopped at Jeju. The cheapest excursion was $120 per person. $240 for the two of us. Instead we walked around Jeju a little then hailed a cab. He took us all over the island doing all the same things for $100. Personal service. Stayed. As long as we wanted. Left when we were ready. One of the many ways weve seen the world much cheaper than most. 73 countries and territories so far. The village is interesting. 100 huts. Some occupied. And a black pig. A guy will tell you about a tea they sell that if it tastes salty or sweet will diagnose your ailments. We passed. Not sure how many people read my reviews. If you hit “helpful”, I’ll get an email and they always encourage me to write more :)"
Large village showing life in Korea in prior years.,"We book a tour on line from the cruise ship before we arrived at the port. The tour included a visit to Seongeup Folk Village. There was an admission fee to the village. There are several walkways around the village. The walkways are well maintained and there are no steps to climb. There are exhibits our old building, farming and animals. There are clean restrooms along the walkways."
interesting ,we were shown how.peopel live in the past in.jejuwe were in a small one owned by a couple who lives there it's nice to.undwrtand I would go
A big village for full visit,"This place is big and we didn’t go through each inch of this place as both of us felt tired when came to this place. If you have time and the leg can support the walk, a good place to spend time with."
Loving the Folks,"Our visit to this village was an amazing experience! We learned a lot about the history Jeju, specifically their culture and traditions. Jeju is known for its black pig pork and we were given the chance to see one at the backyard of one the old house in the village. Plus our hosts were very entertaining and discuss to us the unique heritage of Jeju. The traditional role of husband and wife, music played, beliefs, practices and their livelihood. Moreover, we were lucky because the house we visited was the location of the famous Jewel in the Palace. We were amazed with their stone structures. We took photos in almost every corner of the village. Everything there was just amazingly beautiful. The old houses, tress, the souvenirs stores being in house in the traditional homes, the government offices, the pavement, etc, everything was mesmerizing. The people are very kind, approachable and welcoming."
We use waze to drive here ,"First we were ushered by a kind lady to her village and gave us a free guided tour to the small village , we used the restroom , finally she introduced us some of the products she sell to us like jeju honey , horse cream oil . But the real Seonguep village was behind this lady village which was bigger than hers and where the korea drama ""Daejungum ""was filmed . "
Interesting place,"It's really quite when we visit this place... Nobody around there except us, there's also no employers so we just take around the village by ourself... Maybe it's not too famous for foreigners, but because nobody around we can take a really good picture without being disturbed lor... Wkwkwkwkw... "
Unique place,"We visited Seongeup Folk Villagein end Jan 2018, it’s snowing during our visit. There is a lady tour guide that speak English assign to us. She did it well and we enjoy the visit. The building in village are unique. We were there on the good timing where snows make the area really beautiful. You also can buy some of the products they sell over there, anyway is optional."
A little too short of time!,"I believe this place can be so much fun then how we experienced it. We were there quite late, hence the volunteers (as the tour guides) were in an extreme rush to go home. Totally understandable. However they were still nice enough to show us around. Interesting historical facts about the Koreans in Jeju-do and their houses. They promoted horse face cream towards the end of the tour. Apparently the appropriate time to visit this place is between 11 am - 1 pm or definitely way BEFORE 4.30 pm."
Dissapointed,This place looks kind of deserted and some of the area are dirty and poorly maintained. There are also not enough signage or information around this area. One can skip it since there are many other places of interest to visit around Jeju.
Family vacation,Visited this place during our family vacation. This place tell u the stories and life of the Korean in the early days. Good experienced and informative. 
Authentic Village,"If you are looking for a culture house of Korea. You can get here. I went to this small village on 25th Dec 2017. Not expecting much. This village sell many product from Omija Tea, Horse Bone Extract, and Real Honey from Bees' Farm. And this place were used for shooting ""Daejanggeum"". Even the sales here used to be extra cast on that series."
Living village ,"Instead of paying and going to the Folk Village, our guide suggested we go to the Seongeup Folk Village where it is a real living village. It was nice to see the black pigs in their Sty and how the people live in the past.Educational:) "
History of Jeju in one place,"If you are interested in the history then this is a place for you. Although, I enjoyed my kids found it very boring. "
Don’t waste your time,"The village was deserted. The air smelt stale. No one explained the history or architecture of the houses. In short, it was just a waste of time.Visit in Yongin Korean Folk Village instead. You will have a much better appreciation of korean culture over there. "
Interesting,"Always you can see from Korean drama movies of their house. Now you can see from your eyes. How the house split in few session. Such as, toilet and bath area. Quite interesting. Do not miss it.. must go and visit."
Tourist trap,"Beware for this is one of the tourist traps that you have to watch out for. First they will say that entrance fee is free of charge, then they will show you their tradition houses (which is okay, no offense) but at the end of the tour, they will bring you into a room and give you sample of the products that they sell in outrageous prices. Omija tea, horse oil lotion, and the list goes on. It was good that they didn't insist that we buy, we just said that we don't need them as we have already bought what we need."
Disappointing experience ,I took my parents in law to Korea and visited Jeju to show unique Korean folk village and the culture. The village was just full of tricky business people selling products. I would not recommend this place to anyone! 
Rather sad and dilapidated,"This was a big disappointment. We'd read that it was a real functioning village, but it was mostly deserted, the houses falling down and no sign of any residents. The buildings are picturesque enough but overall it had a rather sad, melancholy feel. We only spent half an hour there and regretted the long bus journeys entailed."
Come with tour guide ,"Came here by tour, would only recommend if someone is explaining the history of the village to you. The price of the products they sell maybe slightly overpriced so so take note."
Avoid it if possible,"We were driving along and happened to pass by the Folk Village. We completed this attraction in 5 mins, because we were not really keen in the fake traditional village. Unless you are with a tour group, there are no guided tour here. "
The antique village,"Yes, you can have chance to see the Korean old houses. However, there is nothing much for you to visit. No tourist information or any other services around. We take a long bus to reach there and go back in 10 minutes then. "
Traditional Korea on Show.,"Spent about 3 hours here one afternoon and was very happy with the overall visit. A full display of buildings, traditional way of life, farm areas, gardens and other typical tourist information, shops and food areas give the whole village a unique attraction for everyone. A little pricey in the shops, but as you walk through the areas you get a real sense of tranquility with the how things were. Very enjoyable and if you are there - make sure you visit."
Empty,"I don't understand the hype of this place. Maybe it's because I went on a Sunday and no one was around, but I walked around for about an hour and there wasn't much to see. The small houses are cute and it's interesting to read how durable they are when taking into account that they are basically made from mud and straw. But the town was absolutely dead quiet, we felt like we weren't even supposed to speak. I wouldn't recommend this 'village'. (There was a small coffee shop near the car park that sold incredibly expensive coffee)."
Avoidable !!!,Coming from India this doesn't look much of a village. Yes there are huts but it's all too neat and clean . Some huts have split ACs too. It's a nice setting but I would have preferred seeing another beach or a natural site vs a man made artificial village . 
Interesting,Interesting but not a must. The village tries to explore the way of life in the past. Not to impressive. 
Nice Historical Village,We got a very nice tour from a local resident who spoke fairly good English. It was very interesting to see how the huts were designed and the durability of the thatch roofs. There was a sales pitch to buy some locally made tea and other products (which were very expensive) but no one bought anything. You would think that they would figure out international tourists wouldn't be buying any kind of drinks to bring back home.
Really nice village,500 years okd village worth to see it. Do not miss oportunity to visit it. Next time I will come again.
Part of Korean culture,I liked the walk on the small streets among small houses without chimneys. It was a protection against pirates in the past. We were group so no local guide came to sell us whatever.
Make sure you go to the right place!,"The Seongeup Folk Village is huge. The main entrance has a big car park and a side entrance where you can drive your car in. Besides the car park, there are many restaurants, two public toilets and a few shops.From the main entrance, you can take a stroll and check out some of the conserved buildings which are open to public. Information is available in English and you can learn about the earlier settlers and buildings of Jeju Island. There are also some shops and restaurants inside the folk village.You can easily spend 1-2 hours inside the village and having lunch either in the restaurants inside or besides the car park. We had delicious black pork bbq at Nammun restaurant (787 2432) located in the area besides the car park.Tip:There are other entrances to the village as well. I was at one of these prior to finding the main entrance, and there are sales people trying to get us to into houses outside the gate and market horse oil cream and other products. Avoid these. While I can't verify whether the products are authentic, it definitely felt like a scam. Seemed that some reviewers thought this is part of the folk village."
Quaint village,Nice feeling as you walk around the quaint little village which are still lived in by residents. There was a free tour given and tour guide spoke English. Ended tour with a little presentation of the products sold by the village. Good for a 1/2 day adventure. 
GOOD PLACE TO LEARN MORE OF THE EARLY SETTLEMENTS IN JEJU ISLAND,Interesting site to learnt about the earlier settlements of Jeju island. Be prepare to walk for an hour or more in the large estate and bring lotsa of water. They preserve the huts pretty well. There are mannequins but with REAL LIVESTOCKS.
Scam place,"We were brought to this house with an old man waiting for us. He gave us a tour around his house and then started selling us omjia tea, honey, horse bones pill, horse oil products. And they range from 45,000KRW to 140,000KRW. I'm not sure if there was any way you could avoid this. "
Nothing much to see,"If you have other places on your itinerary, you can drop this place for your itinerary as there are nothing much to see here. "
Taste of traditional,"All these places are being preserved by the government to protect the rich history of Korea and Jeju. The place still has people staying there especially the old and young.The whole ""village"" is bonding as a big family which anyone has their main job to do. The guide will explain some of the daily things in the past with many preserved items. They will introduce the medicines they use such as honey, horse bone power and 5 taste tea; you also can purchase it.It is good experience."
Unique insight into a traditional lifestyle ,The weather was very wet the day we visited which meant our visit was probably shorter than I would have liked. The guide was informative and the houses fascinating. Well worth a look and you can same the local honey based drink if you wish and possibly purchase if you want. 
So.... I Think We Went In The Back Way?,"Initially, we were only planning on staying here for a few minutes to take some pictures because the reviews were so mediocre. We rented a car and drove to the entrance our GPS took us to (FYI if you rent a car and don't read Korean, make sure you get a GPS with it, Google maps/Apple maps/etc doesn't work in Korea, only Naver). I think it was some kind kind of back entrance, off the road, because no buses or anything were parked there. There wasn't even really a parking lot. When we walked through the village, to the other side, we saw the big parking lot and all the cheesy buildings and shops and stuff. But from the back side, it was just lots of nice little houses (some I think still had people living there) and pretty, walled-off yards. We were there in the morning and the are we were in had almost no one around, except for a few Chinese ladies who had decided to leave their tour and were having fun (we saw them rejoin with their tour later, so I didn't pull that out of thin air, lol). The main front entrance area is way more touristy and that's probably all people getting off the bus see, hence the bad reviews. If you keep walking through the whole town and take your time (if you can), it's actually pretty and peaceful. I think we spent a couple hours here."
Friendly old local village,"Small local old village. There are several old huts for tourist to visit.Shops sell honey, traditional juice and facial cream inside those houses.Sales are very helpful to show direction of road. They speak fluent Mandarin."
Can skip this place. Not worth to go.,"Quite disappointed. Can skip this place as nothing much to see. Only tour guide explaining the history. Never expected a sales talk at the end. Keep on asking us to buy the local products. Horse bone @ 50,000₩, Horse Oil @ 55,000₩, Honery @ 50,000₩ and Tea @50,000₩."
Honeymoon @ Seongeup Folk Village,The village house roof is made of dried grasses. Supported by strong wood. So no smoking allowed here. There are still people staying in the village. The stone man is a good luck and representative item in Jeju.It is believed that touching the nose may increase the chance of giving birth to a son and touching the ear may increase the chance of giving birth to a daughter. Do not touch the head. No good.They have this 5 taste tea; 5 different taste buds depending on your health. Do check it out.Da Chang Jin is filmed here.
Beautiful Folk Village,I love this place and how I wish that there were a film shooting there....poor me. It was a long way to go there but as always it was worth it. If you like Korean Historical Drama Films that this place is must to visit.
A very small village with an interesting tour guide,This is a very small place. But the tour guide tells us a lot about the history of Jeju and the story of the stone statue. She is very funny and it is a pure joy just listening to her story.
Outskirts,"This was the last stop of our tour so the sun was setting by the time we got there. I recommend coming in the morning for good pictures. It was quite solemn, cold, and eerie because it was just the tour guide of the village, our tour guide, and the rest of our group in the area. The assigned tour guide had very interesting insights on the place and the rest of Jeju culture. She also sold us some products that the folks of the village made. The berry honey is definitely worth buying. "
Mediocre site,"This location is quite a nice place for photo taking , the only turn off is that is there are some mixture of areas where the houses have modern features so it can look weird at times."
History and culture of Jeju,"We had a guide to explain and tell us about the history of jeju and the way of life of the people that lived there. It is an eye opening experience, visit this place to have a better understanding of jeju island."
Unique cultures,"This village have very unique culture, if you come to jeju island you must go here, and the honey in here is very good"
Jeju's Culture,"We were there with a tour group and this itinary was compulsory. Interesting to understand the history and a better understanding of the culture. The guide of the village was obviously a Chinese but they spin it to say she is Korean (didn't see any)! Sold products after the talk and items were not cheap. 360,000 Won for the Horse Bone Powder. 50,000 Won for the Horse Oil. Saw at other shops away from the village, selling at 30,000 Won for the Horse oil. Bought the Horse Bone powder and realized everything was in Korean! If this is a State product and only sold in the village, pamplets of it should be in multi - languages as it is targeted at tourists."
Insights into old Jeju,I am thankful that I was not born a woman in Jeju back in the day. Whilst their husbands lounged around like kings they literally did everything. Some great insights from a man who still lives in a traditional house.
Taste of ancient culture,"Cute traditional houses with Korean villages culture. Nice scenary for photos taking. If u like to see ancient culture, this is a place to visit"
Fun & informative,"The place is small. According to the guide (a man who lives there), that is his house passed down to him by his ancestors. He speaks English and some of our Malay language (impressive). It was very compact with the history of the island, culture, food, the roles of men/ women in Jeju, architecture, etc. He was a fun man with a lively way of presenting the information. I think it was excellent. Listening to him is like reading a small introductory chapter about Jeju. There was no fee collected, I appreciate that. However, at the end of the visit, he showed us some local products which we happily bought (the tea) because the children like it."
An opportunity to get a hard sell to buy horse cream,"The small village seemed to be tended by a couple who actually live in the village. I believe the village is government subsidized as well, but perhaps the couple who lives there gets additional money from selling some products (more on that later).A lady who lives there gave us a tour of the houses at the village. She started off with where she lives - which is traditional on the outside, but seemed to have all the modern features on the inside. We then got a small explanation of the milling device there as well and a water collecting jar. We were also allowed to put one of the water jars on our backs. A little pig pen and outhouse were shown as well.Unfortunately, the final destination for the tour was a small room where our tour guide could give us a hard sell on some products - mainly some horse cream or something like that... That sort of ruined the tour, but I could imagine that this could be the tour guide's main source of income. And she was kind when we said no to the hard sell.The tour was informative in many ways as the tour guide provided a lot of information and stories of the hardship and struggles of the native Jeju people."
a nature place,"Seongeup Folk Village of Jeju Island is the place that the past resident live in. The tour guide told us this place can keep well mostly because of the government. The government funds the residents to live here, let them to keep the old building and the culture well. When there have visitor like us, the resident will become a tour guide or shop assistant. It is a good way to spread the culture. Because the residents must know more about the culture than other tour guides. They will show the old tools and teach you how to use it, it is funny and you must be proud of their wisdom.If you like to watch the episode that comes from Korea. You must go here, because most of the building had appeared in the episode, such as “Dae Janggeum”, if you are lucky, you will see the actor here."
Basically here to buy the honey,Interesting look at a folk village. The pig pen explanation is hilarious fun. The honey is good value buy.
nice and historical,"you will learn a lot about jeju culture and the house owner was so friendly, nice and funny......and those who love korean drama dang jang geum, this is the shooting site and u will love it!!!..."
Traditional Korean House and family,"From stories of legend of old people, very interesting and quite heavy life for women and wife who had kids also need to works. at this place id sell the great Honey and mix fruit like syrup its really nice not to sweet lovely. "
Folk village in Jeju Island,I was there in the autumn afternoon when the sky was very clear with bright sunshine... The yellow of the ceilings shone the whole village. The scenery was nice and peaceful...
Learning the old days,The nice ladies explained about how they used to lived. With all the traditional houses and traditionThey also sell honey and traditional drinks. It's refreshing and delicious
Be wary of the sales talk at end of tour,"Brought by our taxi driver/guide to this place since it was were the Korean drama Jewel in the Palace was filmed supposedly. The lady owner gave us a tour of her property with the pigpen where we saw the famous Jeju black pig, the old kitchen and the living/bedroom quarters which was all good but at the end she brought us to a room where we sampled the nice tea and the sales talk began. It was uncomfortable since we specifically told our driver that we don't want to go to any shopping place. Another thing I didn't know that we were supposed to give a donation for the tour and I'm not sure if the 5 dollars I gave for 2 people was enough."
A walk through time,A visit to this folk village is like a walk through time. It was as if time stopped and all buildings there were from the time it was built. The audio explanation was really informative. 
"Very informative, appreciated","We had a short very informative visit at this village as part of a day tour. There are many old-style buildings. Very interesting. A very friendly local man explained us the houses, the surroundings and the past way of living there. We tasted some fermented tea. It was very nice. They sell the tea at 40000 KRW. We would have bought a smaller quantity for maybe 10000 if offered, but they had only the large units at 40000."
10% Tour 90% Sales Talk,"Been there with friends in a tour group. It's a guided tour, the lady guide is already 60+ years and look very strong still. Place is small and very limited space until we hit a room where the sales talk starts, selling horse bone powder, cream, etc All of us were stuck for a while. Other than it's a place where filming of Da Chang Zing, one can give a skip."
One of the recommendable small tourist spot,"We visited May 2016, rainy weather but still open. The staff or local tour guide are very helpful that they provide umbrella that we can use around the folk village. Take note, the staff tour guide we met don't speak much of English, good thing we have our own private tour guide that help on translation. Appreciate the staff for her patience because even though all of her explanations need to be translated, I felt like she didn't skip any detail that we need to know. My favorite part when she showed us those black pig that is famous for their BBQ. Also, the drink that they offer is good that we end up buying one."
Traditional village,"Unique traditional village, good story teller. They offer honey and calcium pills from horse bone for 40000 won per bottle."
Just ok,"Nothing special here. The tour guide is not good in english but she try her best to communicate with us. She guide and explain to us every single thing there. At the end, she promote their products like honey, cosmetics, seeds and etc. You can pay via credit card."
Popular for filming location,"I heard about this folk village 'cause it is very popular for filming location of some Korean Dramas such as De Jang Keum, Juno, Merchant Kim Man Doek...This is an interesting place to see the daily life of locals in old times. We visited the village one day after storm so there were fewer tourists, quieter and no sales presentation, so maybe lucky us."
Jeju honey,Entertaining visit to understand the daily life of Jeju people. Bought honey from this place which they harvest from the mountains. It was a very quick visit though. I came with a tour from Indonesia. They provide a guide who can speak bahasa.
Interesting but spoilt by sales talk,The place is interesting as you get to see how the local folks living condition. But it was spoilt by a sales presentation towards the end of the tour.
A let down,"There were signs getting there until you almost reach the place! Then you have to look for it yourself. The phone number given was not usable. For those who depend on the phone number for gps, best to double check.Personally, it was a let down compared to the literature available on this place. They have converted many of the huts to 'briefing' rooms. So, not many are in its authentic state."
Sales talk,"If you like culture i suggest you to come here. But remember, there will be a sales talk after the end of tour. Its fun experience to visit this place. Also the tour guide is funny"
Short but interesting visit (:,"One of the places that was on our plan of visit. Our guide, the lady that lives in the Folk Village (able to speak both English and Chinese) was a really sweet and nice person that explained to us about the lifestyle of people that used to live in the Jeju Folk Village. Albeit the tour was kind of short as the area was not as big, was glad we visited as we gained insights of Jeju's culture and history. "
Beware of the product sales talk at the end,"What was originally a cultural and historical tour ended with a sales talk of the local health products. They were peddling hard, so be strong with your will power if that's not what you want. The whole village is van be finished in 20 minutes and it felt more like China than Korea with the many fluent Chinese speaking guides who I think are actually Chinese"
Touristy,There was actually special rooms dedicated for tourists that sells Korean ginseng. Seems more like a touristy spot for bus loads of tourists. Not much to see. 
A taste of old-time Jeju,A small traditional village where you can see the way people used to live on the island. Many houses are still being lived in and the ones on display to the public are few but intriguing.
"Avoid , it's a tourist trap to ask you to buy product",Was forced to buy honey after given a short 15 minutes trip in the village. Remember to tell the taxi driver that you don't want to go to this place!
A simple attraction with typical touristy obligations for product purchase,"A very small traditional village attraction with free guide who can speak Mandarin. Very limited traditional houses to look at. No big deal. The attraction is apparently made famous by a TV series that filmed there. Nothing much to see but the guide took great efforts in explaining about each mini-attraction in the village. We ended up in a hut being given explanations on the local products they were selling (e.g. local honeys, herbal health drinks, horse bone powder, horse creams). We were not forced to buy but given that the tour was free, we were obliged to buy stuff that we could easily find for lower prices as the markets, especially Dongmun Traditional Markets in Jeju City. "
So suprise,"I'm from Vietnam and the guide people speak vietnamese too although she come from Korea. And the village is very good, it tell about the people in Jeju is very poor, because woman have to take water in the mountain."
"The guide said one of the ""Jewel in the Palace"" scene was taken here","Guide is good explaining about the village and oldtime Jeju. We came here by chartered car, not really sure how to come here by public transport. For me this place not very special, it's just different with typical hanok house that you ever see in Seoul or Jeonju. "
Excellent Look at the past,This is an interesting and surprisingly well done look at life in the past on Jeju. We loved the artisans at the end as well and came home with a few treasures.
a quick trip to the korean past at half hour from jeju city,"after visiting the jeju folk village, this was quite smaller, still was easier to visit, shorter distance to drive, so if you stay is short in Jeju, come this village, ou will find all about the korean past culture, just missing big stores and restaurant like the main village have."
Traditional Village,Tranditional House and village in Jeju. If you want to know about traditional life. Janggem Korean Drama has taken place the shooting here. You also could buy tea that made from bluberry and horse bone.
Interesting insight into the village life years ago,"We had a guided tour of the compound by a rather fun employee of the place. She was rather animated and injected a lot of humour into her narration. The buildings were authentic and so I think might be actual conserved 'wealthy main house', servants' quarters, pig sty and commode toilet etcPart of the tour included a persuasive sell of their produce (grounded horse bone tablets, honey)."
Eye opening,"Interesting to learn about the wood positioning at gate, durable rooftop, ceramic tanks in kitchen, building of crib, above ground toilet and shade.Delighted to pass by a winery social area."
Learning about jeju culture,We were lucky that the lady of the house was both detail and funny when explaing about the old jeju ways. A good place to visit and get to know abit of the culture.
Jeju ancient way of life!,Great place if you are into culture and history as you will enter the medieval village and learnt about how ancient Jeju people lived and some continued to live in straw roof houses and lived the traditional way of life. Recommend to go and follow a local guide to go unless you speak Korean. 
The real thing and the museumofied village both here,"Serene, inviting and an utterly different beauteous energy of its own at this off the coast stop ( stay atleast an hour or two to really savour it)"
Amusing English Guide,We had an old Korean man who has lived there for all his life guiding us around his own house in English. He was very humorous and a very friendly guide. It was an interesting and refreshing experience of learning about the old village way of living in Jeju! 
Nothing special!,Nothing great about this place. read that it was a interesting little town but drove there and to see only replicas of the old houses. Lots of tourist were taking photos but that was about it. Visit if you have spare time
Waste of time!,Nothing much just by telling u some stories about the village peoples than later wanted you to buy thier products and are expensive too. Village are just some old houses and a waste of time. We have no choice coz it's part of the group tour...if u can avoid this place dun go. 
At the end they'll sell cream and horse bone powder,"They told us the story of korean village and people from last time that how they live and how they do. Actually, I love to know about history of korean. However, all the story that they said it's about the product they gonna sell at the end of the tour. They sell honey, horse bone powder to make you strong, vinegar drink which is more expensive than you buy from supermarket. Horse cream and etc. "
A replica village ,"I was looking forward to seeing the traditional/indigenous village but after a quick walk around we were marched into a hut ...after a brief introduction about this ancient village,then the hard sell began. Impressive products made from horse bones & horse oil - with almost magical values! No, I didn't buy anything.This is not a living village. I could only sight tour operators."
Historical,A little village where most of it residence is women and children. We were brief about the history of the village by a guide in English. We were brought around the village for a visit. Finally we were brought into a small hut where it has been use as a shop for local product. We were all allow to taste the juice and other products which is locally produce in that small village and we can buy it home too if we want too.
Interesting place to get to know some bits of Korean/Jeju culture,We had a guide who could speak Chinese bring us around and introduce bits of the places and provide explanations on the history and culture. I found the information pretty interesting and I quite enjoyed it though it was a short visit.
Very interesting,"This was a lovely place to visit and learn about the history and culture of these people. We visited the home of a man and his wife whose family had been in the area for several generations. He talked about the olden days, showed us his home and talked about the cosmetics and tea made out of horse and donkey. We were extremely happy with the service and information. An interesting visit."
Worth A Stop,Part of a tour I took. I enjoyed the presentation and the chance to see and learn some of the history of Jeju.
be careful,"we saw a signage stating 'can speak mandarin' with some car parking space outside so we went down, apparently is a very small 'display village' which the 'guide' explained some of the history & activities. didn't manage to see live black pigs. the 'guide' saw we cannot enter the actual village as was occupied with people (which I am not sure how true it is). and they started selling us product in the end... however we manage to see folk village which we think should be the 'real / correct' one when we left and go straight down the road and see walls surrounding with flag & a big map (which too bad we can't understand)"
Folk Village of Jeju People,"Here we can known the shape of Jeju Village, Jeju House, Jeju Entrance Fence, etc. Here we can learn how Jeju People Live. Nice Place to go and to see."
great place to visit,"The admission is free of charge and they have volunteer guides in the village to show you around, explain the history of the village. Volunteer guides can speak either english or chinese. Can try some special local products in this village which claimed to be good for health."
A glimpse of village,A glimpse of village can be found by visiting this place. It represents the Korean culture and old architectures.
Interesting history and cultural lesson,Visited as part of a day tour. It's quite interesting to understand how Koreans lived in the past. Families still live there though!
Great for history lovers!,"Beautiful thatched-roofed houses, monuments and stories about Jeju that will make you appreciate the island more. Ask your tour guide or whoever works there what is the story about the gates with 3 log sticks. Found the history behind that very intriguing."
Conservative Village ,"It's good place for experience the local community which they will arrange the local guide whom live tin the village to give you the informations and details about the village including the history and culture. There's the translator for the local people since they are hardly speak other language besides Korean. They will explain the way they hand the wooden stick at the gate. The meaning of the stone statue. They will have to room the tell us their history and story. They will have a village walk so everyone can see and experiences their village including photo shooting. They will show us how to make ""Omecha"" which it the berry layer with honey and keep in the jar for conservative before consume it. The Omecha is sticky so need to mix with water for drinking and contain a lot of vitamins. The local guide will try to up sales their local products after tour such as Omecha and horse bone. They make the bone into small pills and they said its good for those whom need calcium or need recovery from injury and also good for the growth of young kid. They also sell dried squids which already mix with sauce before dried it. It's a good experience as the village is very unique. The house is only one floor and low ceiling since Jeju is very windy. The wall also made with the lava stone from the hallasan mountain.Avoid to go during rainy day even they provide the umbrella during the walk but it's not convenience at all."
Very brief tour before the sales pitch came out,"A rather large village, of what we were allowed to see maybe two ""houses"". A very brief history was told about the place, before we were yet again, ushered into another hut, only to persuaded into buying some super magical powder tea drink. I politely refused."
Tradition and history,"The village has preservations from time past. It made for a pleasant morning walk through the village.It's used much for filming of historical period dramas. One gets to see, close up, relative size et al, a little of what life was like 100 years ago.I enjoyed the bright golden sunshine, flowering trees and the beautiful voice of our guide who sang 2 folk songs whilst using a wine jar as an instrument.We also viewed the daily life of the women divers . Amazing people who adapted so well to the harsh realities of their world."
Film shooting location,"Nothing much here, just a folk village and they have kept it well for tourism and filming location. It is also said that stuff selling here is without tax."
"Funny guide, great experience","Service⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐Experience⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐Value for money⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐Highly recommendedFolk village was great and authentic but the guide was probably the best attraction. Funny, witty and playful, the official guide for the village made us laugh continuously for the entire time we were there (probably to make us feel obliged to buy their honey and umija tea). Their honey is 100% natural and can cure a variety of ailments. Their umija tea is very sweet and bound to be a favourite for young kids. Highly recommended for tourists with kids."
History speaks,Good place to bring ur family and get to know the history of the folk village. A lot of things that u can learn .
folk village,"We joined Yeha Tour and this is one of the stops. Good information, humor house owner. Do not buy the house oil which cost 40000 won. It is similar to Guerisson 9-complex which costs less than US$20 when you buy from lotte duty free Jeju"
Interesting Ancient Village,"We did not had a chance to really walk around the village due to the on-going construction. Only manage to explore the front part of the village. There are students who volunteer themselves to walk you through the history of the village. Quite an interesting one. At the end of the sharing, they also do some selling."
Ok but a tad boring,Interesting to see the way the old buildings were built nut was a tad boring. I thought we'd see people making things in the old methods but most of the buildings were empty. Not what we thought we'd see. With the lack of time we had a Jeju I would have preferred to see something else.
Good old town,This is an old town but still several family lives in. The lady who sells special fruit tee and supplements talks funny and we enjoyed a lot.
interesting local village,"Yeah, this is a real village, whereby the Korean government had deemed it as a living historical site. The villagers are actually living there.You can get the Korean honey there for 40,000 won. A must get for you. Also if you had watched ""Dae Jang Geum"" drama, the daughter of the village head is one of the person giving the tour.And the way they greet tourist is unique. Experience it yourself. Not sure if there is any entrance fee as I was on a package tour and this was part of the itinerary."
Interesting folk village,"At start, the guide will demonstrate their traditions and culture which is quite interesting. At the end, they will try to sell you their premium honey. 50% of the time wasted listening to their premium honey introduction."
An excellent relic of Korean folk life,I visited on a tour from Yeha Bus Tours. It was such an awesome experience that I would have never seen if it wasn't for being part of that tour. The buildings were really neat and the restaurant was delicious. I was there on a rainy day but it was still pleasant. The mist contributed to the mysterious and dreamy vibe that this place had. I recommend carrying a small umbrella. I needed it throughout my 2 week stay in South Korea.
Local village,"This tourist attraction quite interesting for the beginning of introduction after that, they will try to sell anything start from honey, tea and ginseng."
A well preserved folk village,This village is very well preserved and all the thatched roof houses still live in people with generations down the many 100 of years. The ancient mayor office which is called Gaeksa still remains in the centre of the village and was used to be the place of festivals for the old or parties. Likewise to the castle that was built during the korea ancie dynastiy is still preserved well.
Nice village ,Went there with our taxi tour guide. The village is very nice. Check out the folk village toilet. And don't forget to say. Eay well my friends. You'll see lol
History lesson about the life in Jeju,"This was the same village that Dae Jang Geum (大長今) was filmed. It looked like a huge place in the show but in actual fact is that this place is really tiny! It should not take anyone more than 10 mins to complete. We were shown how water was collected from the rain by wrapping a rope on the tree that links into the water pots. The tourguide said that in those days, women in Jeju island work while the men stay at home. The lady touring us in the area carried the water trout to show us how Jeju women in the past used to carry water. There is one small house that according to the lady, is still inhabited. We were not allowed to enter but we can take pictures from outside the house. The house smells of the aroma of freshly cooked rice. We were told that someone is actually cooking. After touring the small compound comes the main part of the program - promoting honey. It seems like there are many version of how real honey should be. For this version, the honey doesn't melt in water. One can see the hives when it's placed in water and swirled around. We were given different honey to try: Pure honey, lingzhi and 5 flavors. For some reasons, they also sell handcream made of horse oil. It smells quite nice though. But I still have a whole box of lanolin cream at home so decided not to buy. They are not cheap either."
Its like stepping back in time,Went as part of a cruise ship itinerary. It really is like stepping back in time to see houses and the village preserved as it was before technology existed.
Old korean village,"Quite interesting! The village represent the korean traditional village in the past, there is different setting for each house, which is represent each job and social status in the past. If you are a korean drama fan, fyi, the famous 'jewel in the palace' was partly filmed here.Entrance fee : free"
Unique and exquisite architectural design,"Our guide brought us here to understand the striking cultural lifestyle of the local folks of Jeju. The unique and exquisite architectural design of the `primitive'' huts and cottages of the natives was impressive. The pair of well carved and exotic Jeju deities statues that were made from volcanic lava stood spiritually on guard at the entrance. The sculptures matched harmoniously with the decorative Kimchi clay vases left unattended in the manicured lush green lawn compound displaying a special cultural taste that reminded me of the unique Hindu traditions on the island of Bali. I always think that it is the vibrancy and dynamism of the native folk culture that made certain attractions so special. The unique Alisan native lifestyle in Taiwan is just remarkably outstanding and different from that of the Maori in New Zealand and again, distinctively unique from the Dayaks longhouse traditions. It is thus a pleasure and a must thing to do to visit a folk village in Jeju to look at how the culture of the natives and how it is being preserved here. We were introduced to a guide speaker who showed us the many agricultural tools used by the local natives but the real commercialized promotion began when we were `lured' into a room with seats and the speaker started marketing a type of drinks made from `Wuweiji' traditional herb that grew in abundance in Jeju and is believed to strengthen and invigorates the mind and body. It looks like another `tourist trap' and on the pretext of going to the toilet, I escaped the aggressiveness of the marketing talk. I wandered around the cottage compound admiring the foliage and the surrounding native architectural designs until my group of friends came out from the promotion. One of my group members was anxious to purchase the `elixir' drinks to enhance her youthfulness and she shared the drinks with the rest in the group. I came out from the cottage and saw there were many similar cottages around the village and there were many sales talk going on in the other cottages. The admission to this folk village was free but I am not sure if my guide earned any commission from the purchase of the herbal bottled drinks by my friend.Except for the commercialized promotion, it is interesting to visit a folk village in Jeju."
Not recomment to my foreign friends,"Very commercialized tour spot in Jeju island. I visited this place a few days ago. I have been travel Jeju island tens of times but this is first time to visit this village and realized this place for selling someting to tourist. If you come to this village, just look around and don't enter the house. There are a lot of good spots you can see in Jeju island"
