Just OK,"Maybe this place would be better after dark. I was expecting to see more related to the film festival, but instead it was mostly for shopping and eating."
Best place to shop ,And stroll around in Busan central. You can find anything you e or need here. There are artists performing songs in the evening. This place has a very good vibe.
Streetfood and shops,Stroll and local street food. Went in the evening for dinner and enjoyed our night stroll. You can also see the celebrities hand-prints around the area.
Food!,Came here for food! Nice place to hang out for shopping and food and an easy walk to Busan Tower (escalator that leads up to the park and tower)
Crowded Walking Street,"BIFF is very near to Jagalchi Market, less than 10 mins walk. If you want to shop local products, you should come here. From cosmetics to clothes to foodstuff. This place is not as nice as Myeongdong or Insadong in Seoul."
Like Myeongdong of Seoul,"The place can be crowded with all the cafes, boutique and restaurant surrounding BIFF. It’s fun place though like how you would probably enjoy myeongdong for shopping. "
Awesome!,"What a wonderful venue! Its huge and very lively! Food, events, shops... Tonight they had a special performance followed by a film screening for differently abled people. This talks about how a city feels so caring and responsible towards her citizens. Bravo!!! "
Busy walking / shopping area with lots of shops and small restaurants,"This is the area we spent most of our time in Busan walking around, visit shops and small restaurants. The shops have good prices and are within close proximity.Each shop (even within the same chain / brand name) have different promotions, which we find unique and makes discount product digging much more interesting.The area usually starts late ~10-11am and cools down after 10pm. You can only find small food strollers after midnight."
Fantastic street ,"This road is located in the historic complex of Busan city. Here during the daytime saw crowded and bustling. The small central road has a car section so be careful when traveling.On the two sides of the road there are many fashion shops, coffee and food shops. The space here is very beautiful, bringing the appearance of the beach town because the sky is always blue.The majority of visitors in this square are young people. Occasionally meet some beggars. There are interesting crossroads with hand or foot marks. These marks are from famous or influential figures in Korea.Walking on the road is very safe, everyone is friendly. There are also specially designed break areas.My experience is to go to seafood market and square in 1 day because these 2 places are very close to each other."
very overrated,When I was here it was nothing more than an intersection filled with food stalls. I found one place with some had prints but mostly it was just food stalls all over the plaza. Only worth takign a picture when you walk pass it on your way to one of the markets.
Meh,There’s lots of shops to walk around but wasn’t really our cup of tea. Markets and expensive stores as well as coffee shops with desserts. 
Not a square as such,"The area surrounding BIFF square was a hive of a activity on our visit. Plenty of shops to visit and food vendors to try. Very easy to walk to the Lotte department store, Jagalchi fish market and Busan Tower. "
Food and Fashion street,"We enjoy walking aroundvtgis area. Near Busan Tower. There are shops selling clothings, cosmetics, etc. There are street vendors selling local delicacies like spucy rice cake, fish cakes dip, etc.Plenty to see here."
Pull up a chair and take your pick.,Reminds me of the old markets we had in London and what they still have in Bangladesh. Stools located beside a mountain of clothes or shoes etc and you just filter through what tickles your fancy. Make sure you go with time to go through the stalls and shops properly.
Shopping and Street food...,"Biff Square gets its name from the Busan International Film Festival.It's dedicated to the film veterans of Korea. This area is full of different kind of stores, as clothes, accessories, restaurant, cosmetics stores, coffee houses, street food, etc...It's similar to Myeongdong area in Seoul, but it is even better.Beautiful both day and night.A must see in Busan!"
"An absolute must, for both day and night !!","Biff squareBiff Square, actually more of a cross of two streets than a square, is a colorful and very busy part of Nampo-dong, where tourists indulge in snacks and drinks, enjoy the atmosphere and many selfies are stored digitally. It is an absolute must not only to visit the Biff Square, but also the neighboring area in the evening due to the very atmospheric lighting and pleasant crowds. A visit to Busan would not have been successful without a visit to Biff Square and the surrounding area, which, as it turned out during a 30-day visit, also feels safe after sunset."
Hotteok lady called us stupid,"After strolling around a bit and trying some streetfood we ended up in the middle of the square because we wanted to try some hotteok (fried snack filled with nuts). The stall was manned by three people. The 'boss lady' greeted us and accepted our cash. We were waiting for our food when another (Korean) customer showed up. She chatted briefly with 'boss lady' and she looked uncomfortable while 'boss lady' gestured at us. The older lady who was preparing the hotteok got a brief command and the food was given to the other customer. I thought: 'ok this might be a prior order that just needed to be picked up' when 'boss lady' started singing and laughing: 'pabo yah, pabo yah, pabo yah!!' I know a tiny bit of Korean. Not much but enough to know that she was singing about 'idiots"". The cook looked away quite uncomfortable... When cook finally handed us the food we thanked her and I nodded over at boss lady while saying: 'pabo'. Her face was priceless. :-DI've only met kind and helpful people in Busan but this was the exception. "
Anything and everything are there,"atever you need. They have it. Lots of food. Definitely stop here if you have time to spare. Cosmetics, athletics, glasses, jewelry, clothing, etc."
Happening,"Typical shopping street, you can find all the beauty brands here and also some sports wear shops. Food is abundant too.."
Typical shopping street,I stayed right in front of the BIFF Square during my visit to Busan.At night it was crowded and better than the day. They sell Korean streetfood there and also cosmetic shops everywhere.
Wander around ,"Got dropped off here in a taxi direct from Busan train station. Nice modern location to wander around, lots of markets nearby too. "
Come Hungry,"Lined with lots of street food to try. Best to come hungry, even though most of it you could probably find else where in South Korea. Saw a short line for some dessert only to find out later that it was some famous pancake with nuts, it’s not bad but wouldn’t queue too long for it. Near Jagalchi market and Gukje Market, so it makes it convenient to explore while walking around."
"Food, Food, Food","First timer to Busan should stay in Nampo-dong near to Busan International Firm Festival (BIFF). You can find street food, restaurants, Seafood, you name it, you will be able to find it here. The subway is located nearby and you can travel to most places conveniently and economically. Also, the Airport Bus stops along Nampo-dong."
Variety of food,"Biff square is located near the Nampo fashion village and Jagalchi market. Crowded place packed with locals and tourist . Lots of finger food to select and we were all hunting for the famous korean pancake filled with nuts and seeds named Ssiat Hotteok. It was a long queue waiting to purchase this but it was worth it because the dessert was super delicious , fresh and crispy. Those with sweet tooth would love this !"
Good place to hang out,Lots of shops and restos on this pedestarion only square. Very safe. Lots of yummy street food at stalls. Worth to visit when in Busan. A short walk from Jagalchi Metro Station.
Hotteok !,"BIFF square has wonderful array of street food, restaurants, shops of course but the cinnamon peanut bun, ie. hotteok was my favourite. Two stalls next to each other, one claiming to be the 'original'. But both seem well patronised."
Nothing much ,"Just another street market for shopping and street food, which you will find there are plenty in both Busan and Seoul. "
Interesting buzzing place!,"Our hotel is right next to BIFF, a must-visit! The streets come alive with many stalls selling traditional food, seafood, clothing, fruits etc. Try the hotteok, Korean pancake, fish cake and other local food cooked on the spot. "
Happening Street Shopping at Busan,"It is like the Myeongdong street at Seoul. There are lots of cheap & mid-range fashion shops around this area. However, the variety of street foods are no way compare with Myeongdong. The variety was too little while only some of them tasted good. Must try their hotteok as it is one of the best I ever tried at Busan."
Holiday,"This is the hub of downtown Busan. There are major alleyways that meet at this square that has the brand name stores centered around the square and alleys with market barrows selling clothing, food and many items like jewelry. The square in itself is nothing special but the alleyways are fun to visit"
Markets galore.,"Very nice place to just wander around. There are lots of market stalls selling everything from traditional street food to souvenirs to clothing. At each side of each road of markets there are also indoor markets, cafes and small restaurants. There is also, of course, the BIFF walk of fame. It can get quite busy but that’s just all part of the fun of being here. The street food is all prepared and cooked right there in front of you and there is something for everyone’s taste! You will hear all kinds of music as you walk around, adding to the already buzzing atmosphere. "
Lovely day or night,"Lovely square filled with things to see, shop at and most import, eat. It is beautiful day or night. "
VIBRANT PLACE,"BIFF stands for Busan International Film Festival Square, which used to be home to the fame film festival . The area is a large shopping area for goods , cosmetics, electronics etc. It also has stalls along the alley with different kinds of street food.The area around BIFF Square is still full of lights and action. TheJagalchi Fish Market indoor is also worth visiting"
Was nice!,"I came here because it was recommended as things to do and see in Busan. It was okay. It is famous for lots of street food. I didn't try because I wasn't hungry. I saw the handprint on the ground (like Hollywood BLVD handprints), from directors/actors from around the world that was given from the Busan Film Festival."
Interesting Local Snacks,We enjoyed the local snacks and walking around shopping . A cool place free and easy to walk around.
Bustling place for a leisurely visit,"Its in Namodong, the primary shopping hub of Busan. Lot of street food options around worth trying. The BIFF square is a landmark and has imprints of celebrities on the floor as you walk around."
Good to visit place when in Busan,"There are lots of food and shopping in the area, conveniently located near the train station. The prices there are very reasonable too. "
Try the hotteok!,"Shopping was not too bad. Many restaurants as well. A must try in this place is the hotteok! Alight at Nampo Metro station and walk towards BIFF Square, you should be able to spot the stall selling Hotteok!"
Interesting ,A very active area with lots of street vendors besides a crowded shopping area. Many interesting shops and restaurants.
Shopping street,Next to Nampo-Dong shopping street. Full of various kinds of goods to buy. Lots of people both Korean and foreigners. Be careful your bag and others valuable things.
Loved it,"If you are a foodie, this is the place to be. Restaurants staff are not as pushy as the other districts in Busan. Prices are decent and I love those little food stands where you can sit in, great experience!Love shopping? All the big brands are close and also walking distance to Lotte department store."
Small square connected to Gukje,Food street and also some shopping can be done here. Very busy and bustling on the weekend. Near to Jalgachi do walk over have a look around and save some tummy space for nibbles at BIFF and Gukje.
Busan's Myeongdong,BIFF Square has a very similar feel to Myeongdong in Seoul. It is much livelier in the evening. Go there to enjoy the crowds and different street food vendors.
Interesting during the day,"We had the opportunity to visit BIFF during the day and night (~9:15pm). During the day, the place is lively and full of food carts and activities. During the night, the place becomes quiet and not many people... maybe we were late by Busan’s standard. Shops were beginning to close and only few food carts were opened for business."
Interesting but tightly packed at times ,This was crammed full of stalls with many people and most of them being food stalls that sold similar goods but all meatThe locals seem to be either meat or fish eaters and vegetables are not so common in this area 
Hispter ,"A lot of youth hangout. PC bunks, arcades, toiletries, art box, cheap streets food and clothes. Nice place"
Uninteresting and dull,"It's another shopping and walking pedestrian zone, with stalls and trolleys set up on the street. Especially lots of food stalls in every corner. The crowd starts to build up towards the evening."
Bustling street food haven,"On a cold night, this place is perfect to find warm treats to keep yourselves cosy. There are stalls aplenty selling various foods from waffles to even grilled seafood. Of course, you could also find knickknacks here."
Not just about Cinema,"A famous attraction in Busan, this long street is one of the must see place for most of tourists visiting the city. The square is much more than just cinema there are also lot of shopping options, restaurants (including a few Indian restaurants nearby) and the most exciting side carts selling food. One can see lot of young and old artisans setting up their shops to sell their wares or draw your portraits for a fixed fee.The opening ceremony of the annual BIFF International Film Festival is held in this square every year."
foooooood,"there are lots and lots of food sellers here.. just love the area. Simply non stop munching...other than food, well, you can stop by some cosmetics store"
Favourite spot,I visited this venue everyday for meals and light shopping. A variety of convenient stores and restaurants to select from. Even the street food vendors were not always the same. It was the most dynamic place in town. Always a hive of activity and a representation of the Korean entrepreneurial spirit. 
This is a good place to experience the street food,"We visited BIFF Square on a late afternoon on a Saturday in December making our way from Nampo station. It was already quite crowded when we reached. Other than the shops lining the streets, there were many stalls set up along the streets selling food, clothing etc. Some of these food stalls have a snaking queue. We also found a bakery shop that sells delicious bread and buns. This is a good place to experience the street food available in Busan (or South Korea). "
Overated,The central area of BIFF is small and basically showcasing very similar things. Could have easily finished seeing the place with 30min unless one venture out of BIFF to scout around the nearby area... 
Much ado about nothing,"I don't know why this is a touristic hot place. I didn't find anything interesting about it. Skip this, there are better places in Busan."
Nothing to see,Not sure if I was there at the wrong time (visited on a weekday around 6pm) but there were very limited shops along the street. Not impressive at all. Was expecting to get some street food but ended up with fast food instead because there were limited food stalls. 
Yummy Treat,For me the best part about visiting Biff Square is eating one of these delicious Korean desserts. It is a popular street food here but the best can be found right in the center of BIFF Square. You can't miss it due to the long line of people but it's worth the wait. You will find lots of Korean street food in this area so try some different things while you're there. But save room for this for your dessert.
Small square in Nampo-dong,"We visited BIFF square to try hotteok. The square was pretty underwhelming - small and not that interesting, no different to any other busy shopping street in Busan. Not a destination to go out of your way to visit."
Shopping heaven!!,Lots of skincare and shoe brands here including olive young and independent brands. Plenty of street food too! Definitely a must visit.
Shopping & Food Galore,"Should not miss this place where local Korean culture is found here: street food, souvenirs, lifestyle, ambience "
Pedestrian busy,"Nice street to do shopping and a bit of ""road food"", pleasant walk with shops, restaurant and stores to eat, buy..."
Night Market at BIFF Square (don’t miss it),"Arrived at BIFF square in the evening, full of tourist and people. A lot of food stall at this area. Recommend to pay a visit!! Nice food , crowded place."
A must to visit if you are in Busan!,"Plenty of street foods being offered at this square. I tried the hotteok sold by Ji Suk Jin of Running man & its so nice! IMHO, its better than the other stall with super long queue cause I tried it as well. You will be spoil for choices. You can easily walk over to Gukje market as well which consists of street food valley, fashion valley & etc. A nice stroll around the whole Jagalchi area."
Vibrant Place! ,I enjoyed strolling around the area. Had one of the best street foods experience in South Korea. So lively I would definitely come visit again. 
Mecca of Busan streetfood,"Busan international film festival square not only known for the film but also for streetfood, its getting touristy day by day, i used to buy multteok but cant see any of them anymore.. somehow at somepoint the variety is kinda same to the streetfood sold at myeongdong but of course less expensive. The one that keep making me back here is the ssiat hotteok and croquete of course you also can found it in seoul but i like the one here better. "
Busy night market with a wide selection of street foods,"The place is a hive of activity. So many street foods stalls offer many delicious snacks. It is possible to try a number of the different food stalls and not even require a restaurant for dinner. As an overseas foreigner, I think this place is a must visit if you like bustling cities."
A crowded saturday night,A breeze Saturday night during autumn. The street food cost 3000won on average. Similar to other country night market. Worth the visit
Too crowded and so touristic!,A bit disappointed to me as this place was too crowded and too touristic as well! It was a good tourist spot to wander around but nothing much to explore nor to enjoy to me.
Shopping,"This is a crowded street with cafes, restaurants and shops. Opposite this street is a seafood street. "
"Touristy, but Experience the Hustle and Bustle (Try the Hotteok- Korean filled pancake)","Busan International Film Festival is an annual event held in October, but tourists can visit the BIFF Square year round. It is usually crowded with both tourists and locals. Just be patient when it gets crowded.There are a lot of shops, cafes, and restaurants around the square but I like to stop and get street food. My favorite there is the hotteok, a Korean style of pancake that is filled. There are a couple of vendors that consistently have lines, sometimes as long as 20 minutes or more. It's really nice on a cooler day to get a fresh, hot pancake while walking around."
A bit overhyped...,Honestly you can walk around here and apart from the arch there's really nothing wow...yes you have your food stalls and you try hotteok...but its a relatively small area with not much to see. It was so busy you can barely see the hand prints on the floor.
Famous BIFF surrounded by many stores and restaurant,"The Busan International Film Fest makes Busan famous every year. But the stores and restaurant surrounding it makes it a very good place to shop and eat. The BIFF is one of the biggest film fest in Asia, the BIFF square is very lively up to evening as people comes to shop and eat in this lively place."
Complete waste of time,There is really nothing to see during the day. At night there are some street food stalls out. Wouldn't go out of my way.
Great street food,"This is a cool area, famous for their movie theaters and Hollywood style hand prints of famous international movie stars. Also has great traditional Korean street food."
Eclectic shopping,Eclectic shops and street foods. Buy an electric mini fan here if you don’t have one. Best $6 investment.
No film festival? Just shop!,"Went there just to check the Star Street and the Festival Street. Happy to find a halal restaurant in that area, so I had a proper and good lunch. The BIFF Square is nearby the famous fish market. Didn't go there tho'. Instead, I went to Gwangbokro Cultural & Fashion Street. The place full of small stores (foods, local snacks, clothes, cute stuff etc). I spent like 3 hours there and bought lots of cool clothes (all the shops put an almost similar price for everything, about 10K Won for , how cheap was that?). It was fun. Wan to revisit it again someday. "
Night market,It is a nice short stroll over to BIFF after having dinner at Jagalchi Market. The artist hand prints are not really the main attraction here. It is the night market which served interesting food. Hotteok is a must try in BIFF!
Wonderful experience,Best to come with an empty stomach! It's filled with rows and rows of stalls selling street food and all kinds of trinkets and souvenirs. We thoroughly enjoy the variety of street food especially the ssiat hotteok. It's a sweet pancake filled with brown sugar and many types of seeds (about ₩1300-1500). One piece is never enough. Be prepared to queue.
Crowded and busy,BIFF Square was overwhelmingly crowded and busy when I visited. Good places to visit if you're in the area or looking to shop.
Okay place to spend the evening/night,"BIFF (or Busan International Film Festival) Square aims to be something like Hollywood's Walk of Fame with commemorative ""squares"" plastered into the walkway, but it is mostly a night market with lively atmosphere. You can enjoy some of Busan's street food or get your palms read or fortune told by one of the many stalls here.While I enjoyed the atmosphere, BIFF square did not really impress me with their stalls as they can get quite repetitive in their offerings (what's with Busan and their cloned stalls, anyway?). The seafood they sold in some stalls were also quite similar to the ones you can find in other markets around Busan. Still, it's quite an enjoyable place to hangout during the evening/night, and there are also many shops around aside from the stalls selling different things. The place is also conveniently located a short walk away from Jagalchi metro station."
BIFF Square @ Jagalchi Busan,"So many food to eat, especially my favorite hotteok (sweet pancake with mixed nuts) is the best in Busan. "
Good place to try street food,"Surrounded by many specialty streets for shopping and across from Jagalchi fish market , BIFF has many tents with local cuisine. Not cheap considering it’s street food but need to try as much as you can and you’ll leave very full. Be sure to look on the ground for hand printed plaques of famous celebrities."
Great street food,Many special street foods that are unique in Busan. The black sugar seeds biscuit is a must-try. Go empty stomach! 
Small square but iconic,The square is small though significantly recognised. Surrounding area with many food stalls is worth a stroll.
A waste of time,"I came here tonight with my 25 year old son and 16 year old son expecting to see a lighted roof that we could walk under and also see movie/film related items. We couldn’t even find the hands of stars. All we found was steet food vendors, shopping, and lots of bars to include a street that appears to be a red light district (no longer women in windows but the window displays still obvious). It wasn’t with the $20 one way taxi fare from our hotel in Haeundae. We came at night as it has been really hot and the photos I found online had the lighted roof at night. This BIFF Square is just dirty streets and dirty bars."
Great street food scene ,"Best thing about the square is the exciting street food scene. Most of the stalls seem endorsed by some random celebrity or other and it's also a good place to try the Busan specialty Ssiat Hotteok - a chewy pancake filled with brown sugar, seeds and nuts. Sometimes following the queues don't always work as these seem to form for some stalls at times and others on other days. We had some really yummy gimbap and panfried dumplings. The tteokbokki usually came with Korean blood sausage which we weren't really a fan of. Nice, lively area with different eateries and shops which will be hard to miss when you're in Busan. "
Shopping Street with Interesting Street Snack,"Yet another shopping street among the many in Korea. Not that much to see unless you are a fan of Korean Movies and want to take some pictures of KDrama Stars Hand Prints in the pavement. But what stands out from other shopping streets is the very Famous Ssiat Hotteok ( Pronounced as Hot Dog). This is a local pancake that was created right here in Busan BIFF square. This local snack is fried and then filled with a combination of nuts. There are 3 stalls next to each other all selling the same thing, but only 1 of them was the original creator. Nevertheless, i tried all three and found the 1st stall (coming from the main street) with the greyish pancake to be the tastiest. Price is 1300Won each."
Crowded,Expected to see stuff that are related to movie/film but only noted a handful of famous movie celebrities hand prints on the floor which were stepped over by lots of people. We could not even pause and see clearly what’s on the floor.....this place is more like busy food and shopping streets like Myeongdong. 
Go for the experience,"The shops, people, street foods, smell, noise were an experience itself. We were there after lunch and even then the street food was just as inviting. We did not explore all the streets, but the few we throng through was a wonderful experience. I would recommend."
Go for atmosphere and famous Busan hoddeok cakes,"One should visit BIFF square just to drink in the atmosphere of tons of people gorging on snacks! On a typical day, throngs of people are staying in lines to get their order of freshly made and fried hoddeoks -a Korean pancake stuffed with a mixture of nuts and seeds.there are many other snacks such as kimbap (seaweed rolls) and spicy rice cakes, odeng (fried fish cakes), etc. There are two large movie complexes in the square too. And a block away, you will find endless shopping - from every single cosmetic/skin care stores to the traditional Gukjye Sijang (famous market) nearby.This area is a delight during the Christmas holidays since the entire area gets lit up with lights!"
Nice spot to try out the street food,"There were lot of stall selling different traditional street food, but kinda in a huge portion; recommend the rice cake, rice roll and brown sugar cake with nuts."
Come after noon,We were here about 11am and it is mostly deserted until about noon when crowd of tourists and locals start to build up. Good place to shop and try local snacks set up along the way. 
Huge street for shopping and street foods,"This is a very crowded street in Nampo. Good to visit at least once.- Many interesting food stalls. But, street foods weren't that cheap.- There are various themes like a film avenue."
Street food and market,"A nice place to explore the street food. If you venture off BIFF, you can walk to the traditional market nearby. There’s a cafe that sells very delicious Korean pancake. It was a crunchy feel, not like the traditional Korean pancake which is soft."
Street food,The place is more vibrant and busier than my last visit. Enjoyed the famous hotteok. Queue was not too long this time round. Will be back for more.
Pulsating,"Heart of Busan with shops galore & shoppers milling around for bargain shopping. Bit crowded.. finding taxis , with street being one way , a bit of bother. But a days outing is highly recommended."
"Nice and busy, plenty of people and well sign posted","Nice and busy, plenty of people and well sign posted. This is in the centre of the entertainment area and surrounded by good restaurants, hotels and bars"
Shopping and grab local food,Good to shopping and try local foods… there are alot cosmetic shops and cute funny socks selling here. 
Revisiting Busan,"BIFF Square was near our lunch place at the market and a stroll over there was appropriate to digest the food. As it was a holiday, the crowd was huge with many stalls open for business. We walk and pick food for tasting and sharing."
"For the Gen Y, up and haooening",Busy food street right outside Gukje market and some trendy shops. We walked through unsure of what it was. Very crowded area with lots of younger generation people enjoying the weekend.
Many street foods ,Many street foods in BIFF square and many fashions. You can shopping in BIFf square. Nearly subway station 
Shopping primarily ,"Some handprints and packaged as related to famed BIFF, but this area is more of a shopping area with numerous shops and restaurants (and street food). Worth spending some time here although nothing really special."
Street foods,"Must visit in Busan. In my opinion, this place similar with Myeongdong , Seoul. So many street food for vendor to tried here. Near Jagalchi market."
"Buff Square, Busan, Korea","The commercial heart of the city.Hundreds of shops, cafés, restaurants and little markets with many stalls.Very, very busy. Worh visiting and it's also walking distance from the famous Jagalchi fish market."
Inexpensive Good Street Food,The street food is nice and inexpensive. Particularly like the little fried sweet dumpling filled with brown sugar and nuts. Yum!
Diverse array of street food,Come here for your street food fix. The stalls here boast both conventional and more unconventional street food. The pancake stuffed with nuts was delicious. Tons of shopping around as well.
Nothing much to see,Not sure this qualifies as a worthwhile tourist destination. I guess if you are already in the area after visiting Jagalchi Market and Gukje Market you can swing by. 
MUST VISIT! ,the best streetfood! its much much much better than myeondong! you guys need to try this yummy waffle! also hottdeok! 
Great place for shopping ,It’s a good place to begin walking and shopping as it’s near the markets where you can buy items along the street. Not expensive and it has Mac’S and a big Olive Young for those keen on buying korean make up and toiletries. 
Crowed but local culture,"Biff Square is very crowded but you do get a flare for the local cultural foods. Lots of shops with lots of choices of things to eat, though most i shy away from. Good stop for an hour or two."
Shopping ,The place to shop in the city. However 5 our of 10 shops are cosmetic stuff. Lita do sale (they call “event”) some street foods. Not much souvenirs though. 
BIFF Square full of shopping center and food,Nampodong was located for shopping. So crowd and you can see many shops. To shopper is the best way to stay.
Street food - Ssiat Hotteok,"Opposite BIFF Square is the famous Jagalchi Market. Hence, BIFF Square can be accessed via Nampo subway station or Jagalchi subway station. Since we stayed near to Busan subway station, hence we went to Nampo station, took the Exit 7 and walked to BIFF Square. I read that this area used to be the opening ceremony for the annual Busan International Film Festival. It was also the location for hand printing of famous movie celebrities and directors. When I reached here, I saw many hand prints on the floor were being ignored and stepped by many visitors. Now this area is a street food heaven. We tried Ssiat hotteok, also known as seed-stuffed pancake. The cost was KRW1300. This pancake/deep-fried dough was stuffed with spoonful of pine nuts, sunflower seeds and pumpkin seeds. This pancake with brown sugar filling inside taste sweet and nutty. A must try if you visit BIFF Square. We ate mandu- dumplings with steamed and pan-fried styles. 6 pieces of mandu cost us KRW2000. In addition, we also ate a piece of korean egg bread or its korean name 'Gyeran-ppang'. The cost is KRW1000, with cheese the price is KRW2000. This egg cheese bread tasted sweet with fluffy little loaf of bread-like texture was not to our liking. We then ate some fried items that cost us KRW2000. The lady re-fried the items, only the sweet potato was up to our expectation."
Touristy spot,"Filled with tourists and school girls. Not really our scene but fun to walk through. Got one of those seed filled pastries ($1.50) everyone seemed to be getting and they were alright. Tried the dumplings too ($5 for a plate). Nothing too special. All food stalls were the same (fish cakes, rice cakes, dumplings and seed pastries). Overall overrated imo but if you’re in the area, it’s nice to walk through and feel the energy. "
The road of street foods and fortune tellers,"As soon as you get inside of this place, you'll find a series of red parasols along the street. There are street food makers and on the other side are fortune tellers.My friend and I, we finished our dinner here including Dak-Kkochi (grilled chicken) and tornado-shaped potatoes...blah blah blah.The fortune tellers they provide various kinds of things such as; asian traditional fortune reading (birthday required), astrology, tarot cards. "
Very busy spot,There are lots of street stalls with plenty of food for sale. So much to choose from and very busy with the locals.
Must go,"Loved this place. Full of character and interesting. Don't forget to look out for the bronze structures e.g. A pig, elephant, etc. These structures are placed randomly on sidewalks where u least expect it. Los of street food, too."
Street food and shopping,"Plenty of eateries, street food and shopping. Not as crowded as Myeongdong in Seoul, so this is the place to shop for your cosmetics and sit in the cafes to chill. Start from Jalgalchi station and walk all the way down to Lotte shopping mall, amazing way to spend the day just eating and shopping!"
The street Food are awesome! ,The Street food are awesome! Try the waffle and something like peanut pancake.Try the korean pancake.Crowded in the evening. There many fortune teller here.
Like a Meongdong in Busan,The most Shopping street in Busan. there has a food street in the night time. You can start at Jalgalchi station and walk to the end at Nampo station. can go to Busan tower in a middle way.
Went for Street Food,You will see lots of food stalls selling all types of food. We ate at a couple of popular stalls and the food was good. It gets crowded but it is still pretty orderly. Go for the stalls with the most people - you will be assured of good food.
Hotteok!! ,"We came here solely for the hotteok. As we didn’t know which one is the famous one - all of them had lines to it, so we tried all 3 of them. All 3 of them tasted almost the same but I preferred the one in the middle of those 3 - on the left to the stalls that sells gimbap. "
Good place to shop n eat,I love shopping around here as they have so many eateries n restaurants around. Very good place to shop n can walk to Nampo station where there are underground shopping. Price are reasonable
Buzzing with street vendors - get your fix of street food,"Heaps of restaurants and street vendors in this area, so if its local street food you're after, this is a great place to explore and get a taste. A fun place to visit and eat!"
Fun,"Every time i'm here is October which coincide to BIFF festival. Even tough it is crowded, i still enjoy it. There are so many street food stalls and lots of shops for shopping. From here you can either walk both to Jagalchi Market and Yongdusan Park."
Lots to see here,Plenty of restaurants and coffee bars here. Interesting to see how the South Koreans use their leisure time. Well worth a visit.
Shopping parade,"Too crowded with shopper. And too many shops around. Definate can take you hours there. Nearby, Busan Tower by walking distance. And Jagaichi fish market. "
Similar to night market with lots of street food,"This place is similar to the night markets in Malaysia, Thailand and Taiwan. Lots of street food can be found at BIFF. The best was the ""Hotteok"" (Sweet pancake with peanuts and brown sugar fillings) whereas the rest are common and so so."
Many different type of shops but limited food choices.,"Plenty of different shops. Vast area to explore. Good for shopaholices. But if you are a foodie, you going to get bored quickly as all the food stalls sell basically the same thing. "
All the asian impressions!))),"Street shops, street food, markets, fashion shops, lots of people and lights. If you want to get it all at ones - this is a right place!"
Shops and Restauranrs Galore,"We arrived on a rainy Sunday morning at 8:30 am not realizing that the shops did not open for business until the early afternoon. We wandered around photographing the BIFF sculptures, visited the mall, had lunch, then returned to this area after 2 pm at which time all the shops were open for business."
Must visit place when in Busan......,"This place is quite similar to Myeongdong & Hongdae in Seoul.Lots of shops, restaurants, cafes & street food/stalls.Nice place to walk around. Jagalchi market is just opposite, across the road. Generally prices in Busan are cheaper than Seoul. This place was used for filming, thereby the name. If you take a close look at the floors in certain parts, you will see names of film characters engraved on metal plates on the floor. Interesting.Must visit place when in Busan."
Nice food and things to see,"BIFF square is quite a nice place to walk about, with cafes, shopping streets and street food around. You will definitely not go hungry but maybe your wallet might haha!"
Street food,"Quite interesting in Korean street food, it has s different then other city, the sweet dessert highly recommend to eat!"
Shop till you drop,This famous square of Busan International Film Festival is a mecca for street food lovers and shoppers .Lots of street vendors selling stuff a must visit place with lots of crowd.
Madness and lots of food,"Explore, camera and have an empty belly. A great place to get lost and see the sights. Enjoyable and fun"
location with shopping needs fulfilled,My 2nd visit to Busan and not sure if its due to weekday the streets are quiet and not too many tourist sighted. There happens to be a film festival held in Busan and the little vendors on the street is not operating their stores where we missed. 
An new experience ,"We were in Busan during BIFF, we have seen and heard about many International film festivals but never ever visited one. Because we had Kdramas fans in the group we decided to stop by.The whole set up was difficult to understand, we walked around a bit and watched a lame movie and moved on.They highlight of our time was when a photographer asks to shoot us in front of a wall of black and white pictures because we were black and wearing black and white. As we posed everyone around started taking pictures just in case we were stars! "
Food in BIFF Square,"Foods are okay in BIFF Square. The best thing that I ate was the Seed Ho Duk. It was really good. The fish cakes were okay as well. Street foods are not as cheap as we think they are. If you decide to seat and eat at the restaurant, you pay few more Wons and you can get lot more for your money. Street foods are for tasting."
Hotteok!,"Definitely get some hotteok (a Korean sweet pancake stuffed with nuts, seeds, and sugar)! Great snack to nibble on while you walk around looking for more food. It's pretty lively in the evening with lots of food vendors, snack stalls, and shops selling to customers. There's no way you'll leave hungry!"
Good place,A ver good place to visit if you really want to experience the local culture..really worths a visit.
Famous shopping district in Busan,"There are a lot of things to but from this area with reasonable prices. Foods are also easily available here. Along the lanes, you may be able to find places to drink beer and liquor."
"Myeongdong (Seoul), but better!","I love this area! So much to see and even much more to eat! Love the street foods, and there are plenty of other things to check out if you're into shopping clothes, food, basically whatever you can think of, they sell it here. Go in the night time, the lights are pretty!"
Wow shopping galore ,Food and shops everywhere. What else can I say? Look at pictures. I took the metro to get here. Try out the street food and eat like local at a food stall.
Busy place...,"Lots of tourists there, many food stalls, restaurants and coffes, also some western shops/brands. Giod to kill time..."
Plenty of food options,"Restaurants and hawker food everwhere on weekends.Narrow streets which adds to the interest.Walk late morning cross road and have a seafood feast at fish market, fabulous."
Eat like a Korean,"Not just the Square, but come to the area and expect to spend a few hours wondering around the shops and trying the different foods from the street stalls. Hint, if it has a long queue then it is good. Join the queue and try it. While walking around look down at your feet and you will see the foot/hand prints of directors and actors (although we didn't see may that we knew)."
Great Place for street food.,"the square has grown into a more complex area, featuring not only movie theaters but also shops and leisure facilities. It has to be the discovery of the popular street snack in Busan – the Ssiat Hotteok (씨앗호떡)! Hotteok (호떡) is the Korean style sweet pancake with brown sugar filling inside, which you can find easily in the streets of South Korea. However, Ssiat Hotteok is a unique Busan street snack, filled with a variety of healthy seeds (씨앗 means seeds) for the crunchy taste."
Enjoy a wander,"We enjoyed a wander through this area after visiting the fish markets. They are quite close. Lots and lots of stalls and food vendors selling yummy food. The stalls sold a wide variety of clothing, personal items etc and of course food. I do think a lot of locals would visit here as well as the tourist.Easily accessible by bus if you can work them out. We found the locals very helpful and always ready to help even if their English was very limited. "
good for street-food places,"This place located in Busan with many small shops and street food stall. Unfortunately, when I came here, it was raining, so I can't explore much. Read many blogs that recommend the Hotteok (Korean doughnuts fill with brown sugar and nuts), and you should try this snack! It's so delicious. You can't find this kind of hotteok in other city such as Seoul, so make sure you try this food here in Busan.a little advice, because most of the sellers can't speak english, so make sure what you order and how much it costs.Worth to visit!"
A venue for many events associated with the film industry,"BIFF stands for Busan International Film Festival and the square is near Jagalchi market, within 10 mins walk. We walked here after visiting Jagalchi market and there were lots of food stalls and food carts. The whole area has lots of shops and you can see snack carts selling Korean pancakes and many other fried stuff. Nearby BIFF square you can find Daeyeong Cinema and Gukje market. We noticed many young locals in this area."
Nothing special,"Not worth going especially, but there is a large Top 10 store and a new Uniqlo store if of interest to anyone."
Cheap goods and souvenirs,Very very hot as the venue is open air. Has many peddlars selling cheap goods. It is cheap to get many colourful socks and souvenirs. Also many good street food to choose from. 
A smaller Myeong-dong in Busan,"There are lots of shops, restaurants, food stalls and markets around this area. I recommend you to come here for a walk when you have free time or you are looking for some shopping to do. There is one snack you must try which is called hotteok (Korean sweet pancakes), the ones they sell here in Busan are stuffed with nuts and I personally loved them! Overall, this place is okay."
Many shops and street-food places,"It is a part of the city with many small shops and street restaurants. You can find pretty much anything here, you just have to look for it."
Didn't live up to the hype,This is basically a street closed to vehicle traffic with lots of vendors & fortune tellers. Honestly it just didn't impress me muxh.
Disappointed ,"I don't find any exciting places in this area. There are many food stalls and souvenir shops. Other than that, there is no much thing to do over here "
Great for shopping and eating ,I stayed in a hotel near by here. I take a walk in this area every night. I love shopping and this is a great place for me. 
Things to see and eat,"This is one of the places to go in Busan. Food stalls and shops around -it is connected to Nampodong, nearby to Jagalchi fish market and nearby the Lotte Mall (all walking distance). Make sure to try hotteok (Korean version doughnuts stuffed with melted brown sugar and nuts). I was told by my Korean friend, hotteok in Busan is better than those in Seoul or other cities). Just watch out for the booth with the long queue and get your money ready (1500won)."
Eat Till You Drop! And Shop Till You Drop!,BIFF Square is amazing! It's a square full of street food vendors full of traditional and fusion good eats along with many bargain shops for all your shopping necessities. It's the best of both worlds! I came here early in the day so it wasn't too crowded but I can guess with my mind's eye how crowded it could get at night. I'm sure young people love this place.There's also a film festival theme that seems to be going around here. I saw stamped plates of Korean celebs on the sidewalks and arches with signs about them but I have no clue to as what kind of cultural events that may take place here. Maybe it's the Cannes of Korea? I have no idea. But look around for those stamped plates if you're into Korean films. Enjoy!
Street food,"I came here on a Saturday during a holiday weekend. There was a lot of foot traffic. This is the place to go for street food. For 10,000 won you can sample foods from a few different carts. I had a good time. "
Hour people watching,The square is pretty limited in that it is really just a collection of food vendors in amongst ageing arches prompting the film festivals. Seems the vendors collect the parasols as there were a collection of dates over the last few years. Very hot day so just sat and people watched. Interesting guy selling strawberry flavoured milk which he made up from frozen fruit. Several older lady stall holders frying potato sticks and other healthy option goods! They correctly predicted the downpour 30 minutes before the heavens opened by erecting additional parasols and sheeting. Tried nut filled fried roll- ok but wouldn't bother again. For us it was fun just killing time and making up improved business models for the stall operators but as they have probably done this for generations we will leave it with them. 
One Reason to Visit,"BIFF Square area is on a short list of things to do in Busan. It's connected to the famous ""International Market,"" a two minute walk from the famous ""Jagalchi Fish Market,"" and equally close to a large Lotte Mall. There's tons of shopping. If you venture into the north side of BIFF Square you'll find many boutique clothing shops. In the ally's you'll also find ""designer"" clothing carts sell mock labels. But the reason to visit is to visit Hotteok Square where the two best Hotteok carts in Busan reside. They are made fresh in melted butter as you stand in line for your little taste of sweet, crunchy, awesomeness! It's a deep-fried, cinnamon and sugar donut type snack filled with sunflower seeds and more cinnamon and sugar. Be careful though - they're hot off the butter ladened grill and they are highly addictive. If you can't find it ask anyone where the McDonald's is and you'll be 10 meters away!Don't miss this Busan delicacy!"
Lots of bargain shopping!,"Its easy to get lost, but if you stay aware of your surroundings, you'll find your way back ""home"". There's tons of shops, lots of street food and more! I spent all day there and feel like I have to come back for more."
Bargains galore!,"My 6 friends and I joined a free walking tour around the district of Nampo. Ben, our English-speaking guide, took us on a 4-hour walk through lovely streets and into interesting places, all the time filling our minds with amazing historical facts. I found Ben on google - just search for ""Busan free walking tour"". BIFF is a rather huge open market area full of sights and smells and smiles! Delicious relatively cheap street foods, the famous Korean fishpaste and of course, Korean beer, teased and satisfied our palates, giving us a memorable visit to BIFF. I even bought a super light super comfortable pair of sandals at only ₩5000, and became the envy of my friends when I showed it to them later!!! Prepare to spend at least a couple of hours at BIFF for there's much to feel and experience there!"
Lively area ,"The square itself is not that striking, however it is surrounded by shopping, restaurants, coffee and snacks outlets. It is pretty lively and colourful. A short walk from the tower and fish market.Thanks for the vote if you found this review helpful."
Unique shopping street,"There's a lot of shopping area in south korea, each of them usually have something to be highlighted.Biff square is one of the shopping area, the unique about this area is highlighted with korean movie. There're a lot of hand printed in the floor. And sometimes there's some performance like music etc.The shops are almost the same with others."
lots of street food and shop,There's lots of street food and shops around this area. It is also across the street from the fish market.
A smaller version of BKK Chatuchak market,The hotel I was staying happens to just a 2 minutes walk to BIFF Square. Best to visit in the evening. The squares are make up of multiple streets. There are shops lining the 2 sides of the streets with makeshift stalls lining the middle. There are different sections to the squares: 1 has many makeshift small resturants; another with many fortune tellers; yet another with foods stall. I even saw a stall selling something like Singaporean pratas. It's a good place to stroll in the evening for dinner and taking in the sight.
Fun energy,Lovely area with lots of food and area selling cute socks. Very affordable items to satisfy your hunger. 
Energetic place in Busan,Many young people hang out in this market so you could find many shops at here. But the most attractive point of this place are the snacks selling here is so delicious and not so expensive.
Not just a little square ,"This place is actually linked to other attractions listed here but getting here you'll naturally be walking to the nearby market and shopping street. I'd agree it's like a version of Myeongdong and found more hoddeuk stands here than Seomyeon. Hoddeuk is the fried flour pocket filed with a mix of nuts and sunflower seeds. There's a lot of other fried food, fruit juice stands and roasted chestnuts too so I found the variety here better. If not interested in street food, there's a whole bunch of restaurants and cafes nearby in the shopping area. You have some American brands there, a huge Gentle Monster and a lot of benches too for resting. Very lively and surely something for everyone of all ages. "
love street food there,"it's a nice place to go, unless it's raining. best to visit at night as it's more happening and more stalls are up at night. have a bite of the famous hotteok there! won't regret!"
The Food is getting pricey ,Back to here after 3yrs and is really surprised with the food price. Really expensive a lot compare to last time visit. Nothing change except for the food price. Just take a stroll as this place is one of the recommended places to go when visit Busan. Recommended to go after fill up your stomach as the food is really expensive. Go for snack not for dinner. Not worth to go for 3rd times. 
Shopping,"Only known for shopping and eating. Quite crowded, but near the jagalchi market so go there for lunch first"
Street food heaven,"For the 2nd time visited Busan, this is a must place to visit.Street food lover is a must come visit, after food you may visit the branded store for shopping or enjoy a cup of Holly's Coffee.Then dinner time, you won't need to worry there's so many restaurant around there for you to enjoy your meal too."
Energetic & Festive!,"We came here on our fourth stop on our Busan tour during a cruise stop. The area had an energy behind it with lights, blaring music and street vendors all about. Our tour guide bought us some delicious street food as can be seen in the attached photo! There were also a lot of stores that sold a variety of items, including shoes and clothing. It was also fascinating to learn that BIFF stood for Busan International Film Festival. "
Nice night views with massive lightings,"It's like a night market within modern malls, u can find street foods and shop houses eatery shops in this areas. It's worth a visit for meal especially in the evening when all lights on."
Film square,"This is small replica of Holywood hall of fame. Street is full of street food vendors which is good, you can try all possibilities.mp"
Crowded and living,It is real shopaholic world. You can find almost everything here. There are a lot of places to eat and drink. You can spend here the whole day depends on your needs.
Lot's of food stalls,"The area had lots of food stalls selling the traditional rice cakes, fish cakes, grilled chicken skewers. It was very fun walking along the streets and enjoying the food. Most of the clothing and bag shops along the way also have no issues with you eating in the shop so you can shop and eat with no worries. "
Get the Hotteok! (Sunflower seed and brown sugar pancake),Shopping and street food. Get the sweet fried pancake filled with brown sugar and sunflower seeds - Busan is known for this dessert and you can get it here at one of the small stands on the main street (look for the long line!). 
Street with food and souvenirs,The place was full of food and souvenir stalls along the narrow street. The local people clustered around this area normally after office hours and at weekends. Tourists would have hesitation in shopping and eating here because of the crowded environment.
Food Galore!,"If you love street food then this is definitely should be on your list of places to visit in Busan. Hotteok (sugar filled pancakes), tteokbokki (rice cakes in a spicy sauce), fried vegetables, korean fried chicken, there's soo much to choose from.There is always something to eat, but I especially love coming here at night, when the area is buzzing with people shopping, eating and drinking. An easy walk from Nampodong subway station, BIFF Square is near the Gukje Traditional Market, Jagalchi fish market, the cafe streets by Jungang Station and also Youngdusan Park. Just start at one end and work your way around the area."
Street foods galore besides lots of shopping,I supposed this is must visit when in Busan area.We enjoyed lots of street foods and shopping and people watching.
Shopping and eating,"It's quite a hippy place here quite similar to Seoul Myeongdong except smaller in scale. You can get street food along the street and most of the cosmetics, restaurants, clothing stores and cafes are located at both sides of the street. "
Get the atmosphere of street vendors,"There are so many street vendors in BIFF square,selling mainly food, but also some products.BIFF square (Busan International Film Festival) also has lots of hand prints in the concrete with names of people attending the film festival.There is a good atmosphere here, and everyone is happy & friendly"
"Awesome street food, super friendly Ajunma","Loved the street food close to Biif square. We are so lucky sitting down at a stall which run by a super friendly and generous Ajuma (I.e. Korean for mid-age lady). We had grilled prawns and fish. They were very fresh and tasty. Ajuma also provide us free dumplings and steamed egg, super generous. We are so touched by the southern hospitality. We left with super full tummy and content. Love you stall 36 Ajuma. You are super!!!! If we ever come back, we definitely pay you a visit again. Highly recommended stall 36 Ajuma."
Very crowded!,"Nice place, full of stalls, restaurants and stores. Avoid weekends... it gets very, very crowded and super noisy!"
Lotsa Food!,Do come in the evening when most of the roadside stalls are open. It's also a walking distance from Gwangbokro fashion street. 
Celebrity walk,"The BIFF Square ii not a place just for watching the celebrities during the Busan frstival, it is a place for local Korean foods. You can enjoy the many foods there and slowly see who are the celebrties who had printed their name on the square."
Picture perfect markets,"We took the subway and got off near the Jagalchi market area.Busy with locals and tourists! Fun area to be in. You can shop, eat and take lots of photos. I can easily spent a few hours here! "
Busy streets large crowd and shops,"Cross over from the jalgachi market after lunch and started walking this busy and crowded place. Lots of people, streets foods and stalls and shops all around. Followed the finger prints on the floor and the names of the stars and celebrities and ended up at the center of the Biff square. "
Nice place,"Lots of caffes, lots of people, lots of stores. Beautifull street with sculptures. Some delicious street food there too. It is worth it visiting and walking around during the night."
Streets where food and shopping meet,"Busy and crowded square lined with pushcarts selling street food to fill the hungry stomach while shopping around. Food to try is Busan's signature ssiat hotteok, a sweet and savory pan-fried pancake filled with sunflower seeds and peanuts cooked on the spot. Go for the one with long queue as that is the one featured on Korean variety show. Most of the carts sell the same food, namely tteokbokki, eomuk, kimbap and mandu. Just go to any of the stores and try these typical street food to have a taste of Korea. There is a nice samgetang (ginseng chicken soup) restuarant as well that has been around for 30 years. Experience shopping around the area as the trends and traditional markets meet in Busan."
Nothing much,Not sure what the hype is all about. It's just like any other streets in Busan or Seoul for that matter. Usual street food and shopping (all China stuff). 
Street Food! Shopping!,"Lots of shopping at BIFF Square, as well as street food. Try the ssiat hotteok, which is fried dough filled with brown sugar, honey, and cinnamon. The most popular stand is the one with the longest line (but it moves quickly). The hotteok is also filled with other ingredients like sunflower seeds. 2,000 won per hotteok. So delicious!"
Not much to the square it is the streets around it,"There really is nothing to the square. We walked right past it without knowing. The streets around with great shops, places to eat, markets etc. That's what makes this area a must see! We went 3 nights in a row and explored as any of the little side streets as we could "
Awesome Korean street food.,"A really big marketplace with street vendors selling all types of snacks and foods like fried stuff, the best rice cakes which I have ever tasted and more Korean snacks. A must come if you visit Busan."
My Favorite Spot in Busan,Great shopping. Each little alley and section has a different category. From cosmetics to shoes and everything in between. Great street food. Lots of good restaurants. Great people watching. My favorite place to visit by myself and with friends.
Great Street Eats,"If you are visiting Busan dont miss the chance to try the street food in BIFF ( Busan International Film Festival) Square. There are many variety of foods to choose from chicken, dimsum, bbq (barbeque) and many for a very very affordable price. To my surprice most of them even accepts US dollars but make sure you have small bills. And just a beware about pick pockets as the place is really crowded which means locals and tourist gather here for one reason GREAT STREET FOOD."
"Variety of food, but difficult to find rubbish bin","Many local foods, very nice and price is reasonable. However very hard to find a rubbish bin to dispose food trash. Overall good experience "
Street food everywhere!,"Are you looking for good street food? This is the place to go! Street food is everywhere! A lot of booths have the same things, so hard to know which one is better. Just go to the ones with long lines :D"
Good for Hotteok,"We found the best Hotteok in BIFF. Be sure to taste the hotteok when you visit BIFF. You can easily spot the both because it always had the longest line. Price is 1,200 won. "
"Food, People and Everything Else","This place was our go to place every time we look for food. The street food is everywhere. All the food and snacks we tried was all good. I believe you really have to try it all. This is a busy place, expect a lot of people, but I think that it adds on the excitement of trying out different street food."
different,if shopping is required this is the area but please try the street food its very tasty as is the local beer we wandered around for 2 hours in a friendly environment and would visit again
Eat Eat Be Happy,"BIFF is the most popular Street Food place to go if you're in Busan. On the day that we arrived in Busan that's the first place we head to after depositing our luggages at our hotel. We love the Ssiat Hotteok (Seed-stuffed Sweet Pancake), Korean ice-cream, and the ""eomuk-tang"" (fishcake served on a skewer in broth) best. BIFF IS THE PLACE TO GO WHEN YOU'RE HUNGRY "
Shopping and streetfood,"Literally, shop til you drop. It's nice to walk up and down the streets (even at night). This place also offers a lot traditional restaurants and it offers numerous street food options."
Hollywood-like street,BIFF square has many shops. I must say it is one of the best shopping places in Busan. BIFF is very similar to Hollywood walk of frame with street food.
Lots of street food,Lots of street food here and not much else. I would think this place is better in the summer when there is a film festival showing. Still a good place to walk if you're staying in the area (which I was)
Shopping streets linked to BIFF,There are lots of shops along the streets that is linked to BIFF Square. It's nice to just walk up and down the street to look at the deals they have and the Korean youngsters playing around too.
Very average,"I went past this BIFF square many times a day, only to know it was famous later. It's in the middle of all the small shops and eats, but doesn't stand out at all. "
A great area!,I visited here last month! There were many things to buy here! And the most important thing was the local food! Dont hesitate to go inside a local food stall. They served great food! Language wasn't the problem! Use ur finger to point out and body language can be used anywhere anytime! Hahaha
Relax and very pleasant walk & shop in this area,"Have all the local and international brands of goods, fashions and food. We felt that this is even better and nicer to shop than in Seoul. Got good food and nice tea/coffee house for a break after a long walk."
Street Food Streets!,"Visit to BIFF was part of our 1 day tour, and we only had an hour to spend here, but it was fun.We arrived at BIFF after we visited Jigalchi market, our tour guide found a money changer so that we can have some Won for spending. Some of our family members started looking at shoes and stuff, while the others went for Icecream in late December, but it was nice anyway. After our icecream we almost had no more time so we walked back to our meeting place, but went through the street food vendors, family members bought different stuff to try, my favorite is the cream sandwich."
good to know Busan Street Food,"everyday crowded, but you must go there for Street Food. Very variety. I can't say the best taste, but just experience will be good. "
Nothing special,it is just a place with nothing to see. Crowded by people. A few sights around. You pass it anyway so no reason to go there on purpose.
Food!!!,"You can find most of the street food there: tokbokki, gimbap, odeng, hotteok (one particular store has very long queue) etc. We went here twice on our 2-day busan trip. I would say it is a must-go place at Busan."
Plenty to see and buy,"Come with a wallet full of cash, and you might find yourself leaving with just half of it.. Plenty of small Lil shops and push carts to buy things from, plenty of random stuff but it can get repetitive after a while, but no worries! When tht happens you sneak off into one of the quaint cafes for a quick recharge. When night time comes, the street gets lighted up and makes for a great photo spot especially in winter. Watch out for the cars though.. They weave the streets like nobody's business.. You might end up spending half your day here, and if you do, head towards Eatery Alley for plenty of street food choices! "
Shopping and eateries ,This is the stretch of eateries and shopping area. Very busy street especially during the night. You could buy street food or stand at the stall and eat it like the locals. Some shopping area for clothing. 
Must-go place for street food hunters.,"Went there in the winter and had street food like the spicy rice cakes, chestnuts and the famous busan styled Ssiat Hotteok. My favorite would be the flower-patterned cake filled with red-bean paste. Not too sweet but very tasty. They even have the silkworm pupa. The jagalchi market is just on the other side so you could easily come here for some snacks or dessert before or after visiting the seafood market."
Busan's Myeongdong,Good food good place to visit for shopping and eating! Went there twice during my 4 days visit.. hotteok there is awesome..the food there is much cheaper than Seoul's Myeongdong! 
It is a local market more than a tourist attraction.,"Lots of street food stalls but selling similar types of food. Most shops sell products that are target for a bit senior people. The seafood market, Jagalchi Market, is close to it."
one-stop,"this is a one-stop shopping and food area! you can actually find everything here, the food stalls and restaurant nearby and the tiangge"
Street food galore!,This is a must-visit in Busan. You can sample different varieties of street food here. You just need to be adventurous and curious. Bring your appetite. You can also do some shopping as there are many shops and stores in the area.
Shopping and street food!!,"Spent the most time here during my stay in Busan and kept coming back for more. If there is one attraction you cannot miss, it is this place. There is a large variety of shops and street stalls to satisfy your shopping and food cravings."
Great place to buy street food,"BIFF square is just few minutes walking from Jagalchi Market. We actually went there to look for Sulbing Bingsu but we were delighted to see the rows of street vendors selling foods from Hotteok to Oden and many more. Btw we were a bit lost looking for the Sulbing store as there are many shops there. Nonetheless we managed to ask the tourist police and she helped us efficiently! We bought two hotteoks from the long waiting line vendor and the price was a bit pricier than the one we bought in Nami Island, 1200 won. However, the taste didn't disappoint us and we regretted our decision to not try any other foods as well."
Lots of local food,The best place to get authentic local street food. There's a stall selling 32cm tall ice cream. Worth a try 
Many restaurants around,"We went there in the evening to walk around as well as to find dinner spot. We took subway from Haeundae station. It was a longgg subway ride. We took green line for 15 stops, changed at Seomyeon then took orange line to Nampo (9 stops). From the subway, it was fairly easy to find. We just walked up and down the street to find restaurant we liked. Lots of people both foreigners and locals."
Good place to shop,"It opens at 11am until night time. Lively at night. From streetfoods, restaurants, shopping stalls, you can find almost everything. Look for stalls that offers ""tax free"" transactions for non-Korean customers. "
My favorite street food in BIFF square - two thumbs up!,"Ssiat Hotteok is the korean style sweet pancake filled with brown sugar and a variety of seeds that are good for health. This is one of the most famous street food that originated from Busan that you can find among the street food vendors in BIFF square. The trip advisor map to BIFF square street is accurate, and you can take the train to Jagalchi Train Station, exit 7.If you like sweet, nutty snacks, this is one pancake not to be missed in Busan. Hope you find the pics to the famous street food vendor selling this helpful! Each pancake costs 2000 krw. Enjoy :-)"
Expensive crappy food,Typical tourist area. I do not know why this was even a recommended place to go. The foods weren't particularly good and it was actually much more expensive. 
Plenty of choices for food!,"Spoilt for food choices around BIFF square! Must try the Ssiat Hotteok, a sweet Korean pancake stuffed with sweets! The food price in Busan seems to be slightly more expensive than Seoul though..."
Street food,"Good place for street food. The ssiat hotteok stalls (signature snack in busan) have queues. Also a good place for shopping, similar to Seomyeon"
Great for street food,Great area for korean street food and close to Gukje market and Jagalchi so you may as well check it off while you're in the area. Great value for a feed.
"Lively, interesting and colourful place","It is enjoyable walking aorunf the place, enjoy the street food and also the shopping. Cosmetic is the main attraction here. Walk across the road towards the fishmarket, and enjoy another aspect of the city....buy the fresh fruits and try the freshly BBQ fish...many are roasted live from the tank....wonderful experience"
Full of food carts and people,This really gets crowded in the evening with plenty of food carts and people shopping and noshing around. There are plenty of stores for the ubiquitous Korean cosmetics .
Wow! ,Wonderful architecture in the film institute building-with superb lighting & lots of different angles! Wish my photos would load to share-so just go see it at night! Fun!
Only for shopping,"Another commun place to go shopping, but not realy charming, A few streets with street food stands like everywhere, a few streets of markets with classic goods of korea. "
Street vendor food,"We came here whilst exploring the fish market and Jagalchi area. If you want to try Korean street vendor food, you will be spoilt for choice. This area is usually crowded and busy, and is a great alternative to the fish market area if you don't like seafood. Easy access from Jagalchi subway station."
Buzzing centre with lots of street food!,One of the many reasons why I life in South Korea! Plenty street vendors and all sorts of markets here. This place is huge! With lots of korean street food and street shops. There are just so much to see. Must try the korean hotteok... Take time to explore the small streets and you'll be surprise with what you can find. Just mins walk from Jagalchi / Toseong station. 
BIFF 2016,The best season to enjoy the movies with iconic architecture of the building. Specially at night time the building is just like shinikg sky with full of stars.
Busy and convenient,"It is a busy shopping area close to Jagalchi station. As I was staying at Hotel Noah at Jagalchi, this is very convenient as it is just across the road. A bit like the Myeongdong shopping area in Seoul but much smaller in scale. After shopping in the BIFF Square one could walk across the road to have a nice seafood meal at Jagalchi."
The place for street food,"It's a very busy region, with a lot of different street food; everything, the time I was there, there was a very good chicken place that I would every day, on the right side; "
Interesting & dont miss the food alley!,"One of my fav place in Busan! It is crowded with tourist & locals. Many stalls offering food, drinks, toys & socks. It is getting more & more crowded after 8pm!Dont miss out to experience Korean street food here!"
"Lots of eateries, good place to shop and walking around!!!",A good place to shop and walking around with lots of eateries from street food to restaurants!!! Price of street food was reasonable compare to Seoul with lots of variety!!!
Buzzing and Busy Shopping area,Loves the streets of shopping aisle. places like public walking area and directions were very clearly indicated. It is a must go shopping area. 
Extremely Happening with Many Street Food,"Atmosphere was great, many street food selling different kinds of food (but the same kinds of food tend to be positioned together). It is also located near Jagalchi Fish Market and Busan Tower (walk from Jagalchi Station(, so you can plan your itinerary to visit all 3 places in a day."
Great to wander around,Lots of good food to try and wander around. Clothes and cosmetics are also available even though not as much as in Seoul. But prices are mostly cheaper.
A square with lots of food stalls and some shopping places,It was a bit wet at the time I visited the square. A nice place to kill time with lots of food stalls and a spot of shopping. Not necessarily a place I would go out of my way to visit though. 
"Lots of happenings and crowded with food, goods and people","Very crowded with people rubbing sholdiers on weekends and holidays. You can find everything there, all types of food and street vendors selling everything. Shops lined the streets selling popular Korean skin care and cosmetic products. Just like Mongkok of Hong Kong. Prices here are cheaper with a lot of shops competing against each other with promotions and sales."
A place to spend a half day,"So there is shopping here (I'm disappointed with shopping in Korea as a whole but you can purchase some things here), and there is food and caffee and this place is full of people and popular.We have been here on a rainy day, and even though it's on the open air it was ok and we could hide in places fro the rain.Generally it's a nice place for few hours especially if you're not into hiking or it's not a pretty day."
Rainy day today but we got a glimpse of amazing atmosphere here at Nampo-dong,"A lot of street food vendors, shops of name brands that are quite familiar as well as smaller boutique and street vendors. Lovely area even when it's raining. Although it was a bit difficult to navigate but we walked from Nampo all the way to Jagalchi market. "
Lots of Happening at BIFF,"We visited the place 1-5oct, lots of events, activities happening with varieties of street food, restaurant food and even bars, shopping outlets around the area. Each & every night different happening there!!"
worth a look,You can follow the bronze plates in the pavement of famous Korean actors.If there in October there is a big festival when celebrities can be seen in the restaurants.
Illumination festival in the winter,It worths a visit during winter season. The illumination festival has been popular recent years and you can also see many locals enjoying themselves here. In the small alleys you can find interesting cafes and shops too :) 
Food street,Basically the BIFF has moved to a new cineplex beginning 2014 but you can still experience what was there previously. Now it's a food street and shopping haven for all those who like to shop
Shopping and snacking around,"This area is great for shopping and eating around, but it gets quite crowded on weekends and when students are out of school. Weekdays during lunchtime has less people. Stores start opening at 11AM.Here, you can find almost every brand of cosmetics shops, sports stores, clothing stores, and other random stores on the big street. Most restaurants are on the small street parallel to the big one. You also have the park with Busan tower nearby. You can access it through the big street. There's an area with several escalators that take you up to the park (you'll have to walk the stairs on the way down)."
Go with free guide to Nampo-dong.,"This area has many interesting sights but hard to navigate on your own. Benjamin tours is free and gives a great tour , Full of local color where the locals are."
Go Shopping,"It's like a place where you can go shopping and eating, or even having some entertainment like Karaoke (Noraebang). A lot of big clothes store such as uniqlo, topten10, and others. Also a lot of cosmetic shops, with all their discount going on. It is really crowded there though. The foods there where really really good, I had dinner twice there and both of them were really nice."
Square,"Good market with street food and some original souvenirs. I found some Psy (Gangnam Style performer) socks for just 1,000 KRW. Close to lots of restaurants including the fish market."
Light sightseeing,"You can get ur souveniers here, do ur shopping, get some local food, minggling with the locals, see some arts displayed along the streets"
Where its at in Busan,"You have everything here: bars, food, shoppijg, exploring, etc... In the you can see Gentle Monsters a sunglass place that is more art gallery than hlads shop. And of course they have all your standard retail and bargain shopping its Korea..."
Place for Tourists and Youngsters,"Walked over there from Jagalchi Market. Easily spotted with the big umbrellas. Went straight to the famous buns with seed fillings and it was rather tasty! Its a place with a history and modern context, iconic of Busan as well. Should go there and feel the vibes of the area. Many young locals there to experience youth culture."
Best food Street in korea,"The food street is really long, i was quite surprised. It starts more or less at the biff square. There are small food tents all around the area, but this one streey is the best: big varienty and good price."
Happening area,"If you like to shop youngster clothing, cosmetic and night life this place is recomended. This area more family spending time here.... but not baby friendly place difficult to find breastfeeding room and baby changing room so bring a scarft fo bf mummy and changing mat ^^"
Food paradise,It is definitely a place where you can hunt for varieties of local Korean foods which looks so special and delicious while it does not cost you much. It's also a shopping place for you to stroll around while enjoying the local street foods. As there is not much shelter so rainy day is not recommended. You will probably spend more time here as there are streets for you to explore and enjoy your shopping spree. I will definitely come back again on my next visit to Busan.
"Full of decent restaurants, shops and street food - a really good place","BIFF Square proved to be one of the high points of our visit to Busan. There is a huge amount of shopping alternatives available; great restaurants and good street food. The area was teeming with people and had a terrific vibe - the feel was genuinely good and the local people are wonderful - kind, welcoming and eager to help visitors.BIFF is a must-do in Busan."
Tasty Street Food!,"If you are in Busan and you want to try the local street food I can't recommend BIFF Square enough. It's situated just a couple of minutes walk from Nampo subway station and very near other tourist sites such as Busan Tower, Gukje market and Fashion street. Lots of tasty local street food at very reasonable prices. Just go from stall to stall to get a sample of everything as you walk along experiencing the local culture!Note though that these are street stalls and although some of the stalls have small areas you can sit down at there generally aren't any tables and chairs set-up. It's all outdoors too so bring an umbrella if its raining."
bUSY AND HAPPENING PLACE,Crwoded despite the raining day. many shops to browse and also many food stall! It's also nice to just sit down in the cafe to do people watching.
Korea local stuffs,"There are a lots of international brands outlets and local products as well. I got a lot of korea made shirts and pants there. Local street foods, fried chicken and beers, hotpot, whatever Korea food you craving for you can get there. Price are reasonable and good to shop."
Street Snacks to the Max,"BIFF Square gets its name from the Busan International Film Festival (BIFF). BIFF Square was the original location of the festival which started in 1996. The festival was later moved to the newly built Busan Cinema Center in 2012, however the square is still a busy place, lined with a wide variety of shops, movie theaters, movie paraphernalia and lots of street food stalls and restaurants.A great place to pick up ""hotteok"" which is the local deep fried dough generously stuffed with nuts, seeds, sugar and cinnamon. In addition, many other stalls sell meat on a stick which is always good eats. BIFF Square is pretty easy to find. It’s in the same neighborhoood as the Jagalchi fish market and Nampo-dong shopping area."
Lots of street food,We went through BIFF on our way to gukje market and were surprised to find the area lined with street food. It was also much easier to find that the stalls in gukje as they're in a concentrated area. 
Good Place for Food and Sightseeing,"Went there in the late afternoon and it was hyped up with activity. There are many shops lining the street and at night, you get to try out many local street food. Be sure to try out the Hotteok- one of Korea's specialty. For Muslim travellers, there is a Little India Cafe located in this street (My Muslim friends went there for dinner)."
Nice Place to Walk Around,"This is one of the famous tourist attraction which is located near to the other attraction. The atmosphere is great, very crowded and very interesting place to visit. There are also lots of carts selling Busan snacks."
Much to See and Eat,"I am not a big shopper so this was not ""up my alley"" completely but it was still fun to walk around and see the shops selling different things. The best was this street food cart selling a clear jelly in the shape of what looked like mochi but it was completely transparent (I thought it was jellyfish maybe but no)."
Great place for food,Lots food stalls. U can try various types of korean street food here. Also lots shopping complexes for shopping fanatics.
Just another shopping area,"This is just a continuation of the shopping area around Gukje and Ggangtong Markets with lots of street food stalls and cafes. There are lots of restaurants, pubs and clubs at the side lanes branching off from here. It appears to be a red light district.The crowd was quite massive on a Sunday afternoon."
Street food galore,"We came when it was raining, but there was a long line of street food stalls still selling. There was still a long queue at the hotteok stall, so we chose to get Kimbap and Tteokbokki from another stall, which was great. On the floor are handprints of award-winning directors in the Busan International Film Festival, much like at the Hollywood Walk of Fame or Hong Kong's Avenue of Stars, so you can take a look while savouring some delicious street food. Afterwards, head to the nearby Jagalchi market."
Food and shopping ,"BIFF Square is located at Nampo station. The street was filled with delicious and adorable street food such as tteokboki, odeng, gimbap and hotteok (something like sugar filled pancake) there are also shopping streets around with variety of both big brands and small shops. "
So much stuff ,So much stuff everywhere to shop. If you have money and love to shop go here. The prices didn't seem too bad. It was crowded and busy.
Fun and food!,High energy area with lots of colorful sights and every type of food stall imaginable! Easily accessible by subway or bus.
Just a place cant miss out ,"Came for the fame of busan movie festival . Surprisingly vibrant. Not the artistic scene but for street food and restaurants. Good for shopping, eating n just to feel Korea food scenery."
"Really crowded, bustling, accessible with good food","There's almost always a queue for this, but the hodok is really good. Be sure to try it! Also, filled with cafes and chicken places, its great for food and shopping."
Very crowded. Great shopping and great people watching.,We visited BIFF Square at least three times and spent several hours each time. Restaurants and shopping are great and be sure to get some pancakes from the street vendors.
Variety street food near to all Nampodong attractions,"If you are looking for some well known Korean street food, there are plenty within BIFF Square. Some of these hawkers are extremely popular and you will see long line of queues at various times of the day. They open everyday from around 10am till late at 9pm. This place is part of Nampodong and there are a lot more back street shops than just in BIFF.BIFF is also within walking distance to Jagalchi, Nampodong shopping street, Gukje Market as well as Yongdusan Park. One could easily spend the whole day exploring all these places.If you are looking for money changers, I saw at least 3 on one of the back street of Nampodong. The rate among them vary quite a bit, so shop around. On the day I arrived at the Gimhae airport, the rate for AUD$1 was ₩820 within the airport. On the same day, I exchanged for ₩852 at Soffia Money Exchange in Nampdong. This money changer is just about 5 minutes walk North bound from BIFF and it was very yellow with a multi-currency symbols display just behind a small shopping mall called Hi Mart. I went to this exchange for another two occasions, and at every time I received a good deal when compared its rate to XE. Korean banks are known to also give good rates, but this was still better."
So much fun!,"I love BIFF Square. It is such a lively place with so much to do and see. Great for food, shopping, and meeting new people.There's also some tourist police around to help giude you if you need it!You can't go to Busan without stopping here multiple times!"
Shopping street,It a shopping street.BIFF is mean Busan International Filem Festival. Just shop and walk around.. ..
Food,"all you can name of Busan local food, oedeng, dried squid, bugs etc. i especially like the 호덕 hodok, and fried chicken!"
Shopping and food Paradise,"We planned for a half day trip to BIFF and ended up spending another day here. The first day when we were here it was raining, so not much of shopping done. Checked weather online and found out weather is good the following day. We had a good lunch and dinner here. Advised to stay nearby as its convenient for resting and putting staff bought at hotel and continue shopping...."
Best street food,"The whole area is full of street food stands, so it is impossible to stay hungry while crossing the neightbourhood."
Good place to have your dinner here ...,"There are many local street foods available here, personally I like the ""黑糖饼” very much, you may want to try it, long queue but nice. It's like a kind of hand made cake filled with brown sugar and nuts. There are more stalls open on weekend as compared to weekday. Many local tourist will come to this place as well."
LOTS A FOOD!,The area around BIFF is the center street shopping/ night street of Busan. It is very lively with lots of junk food and street shops.
Try some street food and pick up some tacky souvenirs,This is a great place to stroll around and do some people watching while filling yourself up on tempting street food.
Lotsa food,It's not a big place but it's packed with street vendors. A good place for street food lovers. They even have Turkish ice cream!
Alot of nice street food,"Lots of different choices of street food, and crowded in a kinda cool way with alot of locals and also tourists."
Perfect location,"This is a place I went to almost everyday in my 2 weeks journey to Busan. Biff Square is surrounded by cafes, restaurants and bars, museum, bowling, shopping area and the fish market. A typical place to meet up with friend to do something. If you go here you have to try Hotteok. The street food is amazing! It can get a bit crowded though:/ so keep your eyes on your friends so they dont disappear."
"Food, food and more food!","There are so many street food vendors here. The smells and the atmosphere is superb, albeit slightly crowded."
Shopping and the food,Try to enjoy the street food. And shop for cosmetics product. Nothing much just shop till you drop. Busan is not the crowded like the seoul
Must go! Especially for film lover and food lover.,"This was the spot for Busan International Film Festival, if you have time , do look for hand print of your favourite director , I did find the hand print of some director that I like. But the main reason I go was for for street food, the food is cheap and good, so it a must go attraction for we. The best I had is the Hotteok - a fried Korean pancake with nut inside. Do becarefful to choose which store to buy from , two store which stated the ""original"" is place side by side. You might brought from the wrong store. For the older ""original"" is much better."
BIFF after dinner ,"A good walk to digest our food after dinner, however it's raining day while we visited, so no much stall is open. I think it could be quite interesting while visit during day time. Exit10 at JAlgachi station, turn right walk straight, it's onthe 2nd junction I your left "
Street Food Extravangaza,"Good place to sample street food. Surprise to see two Malay ladies (Indonesian) operating a stall selling ""mee goreng"". Very enterprising."
Street food galore!,Lots of street food and cheap shops everywhere. The fresh food being made had great photo opportunities. Then walk to the fish market for even better pictures !!!
Full of people on Friday evening,"The square with numbers of different stores that attracted thousand of both local residents and tourists. many hawker stalls, you may have lot of chances to taste different local foods. However, the performance at the centre was very noisy which you we were unable to stand for long. If you like shopping and eating, the Square is surely you choice."
A nice place to walk around,"It is nice place to walk around block after block with street food stalls, shops , restaurants, coffee shops. "
a lot of street food,"nice street foods here, many stalls, must go try the food. the first day we went rained, so we went again the next day. there's a hotteok with long queue in the centre, the fish cake balls near to it taste great too"
crowded street,a safe place to walk around..shopping and eating.. variet of choices. top ten korea mall is located in this area
Shop and try street snacks in BIFF Square,"Lots of shops and lots of food carts/food stalls set up in the square. Be sure to try the famous ""hotteok"" a sweet Korean pancake fried and stuffed with a mixture of nuts and seeds. There are many snack carts selling hotteok, but look for the one in the center of the square which usually has the longest line. A famous singer visited this cart, so it became more popular. I went by subway metro Line 1 to Jagalchi Station, exit 7. You walk about 5-10 min straight and then you'll come to a street on the left that takes you to the square. (from the exit you can walk 300 meters towards Daeyeong Cinema). Take care of your wallet in the crowds. Also very close to Jagalchi and Gukje Market, so can easily combine them in the same day. You can easily spend a full day if you like to shop."
Interesting street life. ,"This place has a mixture of cultures. People seems to be ignoring what is the purpose of this square and the famous hand prints on the ground.There are plenty of street food, I think fortune readers etc. Worth a visit to see street life."
Square but Happening,"The center for street food, a lot things to shop , a working distance from Busan Tower, shop for souvenir. Its a happening place and a lot of tourists & the locals come to enjoy street food."
Street Eating,This was a great place to eat delicious local street food. the most exotic thing I tried were cocoons. 
TRY THE FAMOUS HOTTEOK. ,"You haven't been to BIFF square if you don't try their famous Hotteok. There is one single hotteok stall around the middle of BIFF Square that is constantly crowded with people. Their hotteok are freshly made and filled with goodness of peanuts, sunflower seeds and some other ingredients. Its so good you would want to have it more. I would say BIFF square is mildly similar to MyeongDong in Seoul. Good place to chill and walk around. "
Street food!,"It's a little myeongdong in Busan, street food, shops, street performances all you can see in myeongdong you can find it here."
Shopping & Street Eats,"Traditional street eats spread across this walking street where you can get simple yet delicious tokbokki, fishcase, pancake, korean food . It just located next to Nampo-dong shopping street & Jalgachi market "
Great street markets,Fun time walking the streets and grabbing food here and there. Fun little shopping areas but mainly clothes. Nothing stood out but a great experience 
Crowded food stall square,"This area is usually crowded with food stalls and people, you can also do some shopping as there are several stores in the neighbor. In close proximity with the fish market, Busan tower, and a Lotte Dept store so it would be a good stop but not a destination itself."
Busan street food,I'm not much of a foodie myself so I felt that the place was just mediocre after all the other markets' experience in Seoul.
Our Busan experience,"On our way to the cruise terminal, we bumped into this area that added to our Busan experience. If you want people watching, shopping and tasting different food, you can have all these in this area. We saw “BIFF” all over the place, that stands for Busan International Film Festival. This area is a shooting location for movies. We saw the hand prints of the directors, actors and actresses on the streets and felt the vibrant life here. Happy Travelling!"
So much fun!,"Lots of street food, people watching, and things to buy. It was easy to find and enjoyable to walk around. A variety of food choices, and if looking for a sit down restaurant there are options near by as well. Fun way to spend a couple hours in the afternoon."
Many local food,"You can find many local food and restaurants nearby, crowded with peoples and foreigners. Busan tower is nearby."
Noisy but a bit interesting,We went here to get some street food and shop around.But a bit too noisy and stressful for our infant...
Food and shop street,there got different type of foods selling. and also some shopping. Can enjoy eating and standing together to keep warm. :)
Shopping and eating ,There so many traditional street food in this place! I had to stop here so many times for hottok korean sweet pancake filled with nuts. You should try spicy tokboki and many street food can be found here. Many of the sellers hang a pictures of their stolls which appeared on TV xD it's a korean thing if you know korean show you will understand what I mean. By the way if they were in TV there food will be delicious.. not all the time though 
NICE SHOPPING STREET,"nice shopping street with nice western stores and fat food,you can find there clothes souvenirs and shoes.nice to visit day and night."
A shoppers' delight.,"Someone on TripAdvisor very accurately referred to BIFF Square as the ""Myeongdong of Busan."" In my opinion, if you've been to Myeongdong in Seoul, you've been to BIFF Square.There is a lot of shopping to do and a fair bit of street food to be had. I recommend sampling the Busan style ""hotteok"" - a brown sugar and nut filled pancake. Delicious!"
Best walking street in Busan.,It's like a normal Street Market & food stall with a reasonable prices. Normal bargain is around 30% down only some of them may go down to 50%. It;s not a one way street but like spider web. you could spend 2-3 hours without notice. Highly recommend
Busy and Dirty - Nothing much to see,"BIFF Square used to be much nicer. Now, most of the movie action has moved to the newer Haeundae area, and BIFF Square in Nampo-Dong long ago fell into decay. To be fair, they are fixing it up, so there's a lot of construction now, but it was filthy and crowded even before the construction started. If you're here for movies, there's one small one (three screens?) left. Go to the Lotte Department Store instead - it's a much nicer place to see a film, although it might be even more crowded during peak times. The only saving grace of BIFF Square is that there are some interesting stores in the area (Artbox, for one - a good place to pick up some funky gifts), but many of them are similar to franchise locations in other parts of the city. There are also some small food kiosks, and some of the eats are pretty good (long lines sometimes, though). If you have a day in the Nampo-Dong area, skip BIFF Square and hit Kukje (""International"") Market, Yongdusan Park, and Jagalchi Fish Market."
Food street with actors print on the floor,Nice food street with actors/actresses print on the floor. Similar concept as the Hollywood street. There are also stalls selling crafted items on sale too.
The Myeongdong of Busan,"As the title suggests it's almost like going to Myeongdong in Seoul. Plenty of street food to eat, plenty of street stalls to look at and overall a great way to spend a night!"
Great place before bedtime,"If you get hungry or board in the evening, no worry, this square is a great place for leisure!You can try Korean small dishes with affordable prices, and experience how local people enjoy their late evening life. Those kiosks sell different kinds of food and they are all delicious.Also there are many game zones which full of local youth, come and you will know more about the culture among them."
Best Hotteok Ever,"For me, this is still the best place to get those wonderful Korean pancakes! The square is very busy with lots of food to sample. Just walk around and taste what appeals to you. There are also a lot stores selling trinkets and stuff to choose from. "
Streets of lots of snacks,"Went there once for sightsee-ing, shopping and snacking. There's a lot of different snacks around here. And also there's a cinema around here but missed it due to have not enough time."
Interesting place,"Interesting place to go, but only go once for sightseeing and snacking. The shopping areas are definitely can not be compared to like Myeondong . "
Lovely bustling place,"Love the walk, the sight and sounds. Lively folks, a good mix of sightseeing, and shopping. Certainly would be back for it."
Nice walk,Visiting Busan you will most probably visit Nampo and the area is nice for a walk and shopping. Pretty much like downtown Seoul
Glamour and alll,BIFF Square is home to the annual Busan FIlm Festival. Teeming with people and very busy. Visit for the atmosphere.
Busy Area For Shopping & Eating,"Here, you can find lots of shops, restaurants and food stalls to choose. Always busy from afternoon to nighttime. Main street shops are for young people but you can find thick trousers and/or household items in the side streets. You can also find different restaurants offering various cuisines to choose. This is also on top of those street stalls selling various types of snacks ranging from rice cakes, sausages, fish cakes, sweet soup etc etc. Along the main street, you can also find bronze made figures to highlight the film making theme of the area."
Enjoyable night market,"Street food, big crowds, and loads of shops. If you don't mind crowds and you like a little energy, check it out in the evening. It's right across from the Jagalchi Fish Market too so...two birds with one stone."
Shopping time ....more for the young and trendy crowd,"Huge area to cover, if you are keen shopper after Jalgachi Market than heads here. Many local food and stalls sell all kinds of clothes,shoes,souvenir, trinkets, comestic, bags......gosh the list will be long. Cafe are very interesting. You might end spending half a day here. Go and have fun here."
variety of food,food is delicious and is relatively cheap. it is open early morning till late night. recommended to eat the hot food.
Street Food!,BIFF Square and the nearby Gukje Market are two places that have some really good street food in Busan. We really enjoyed the hotteok. There's a fun shop called Artbox that has a random assortment of everything.
