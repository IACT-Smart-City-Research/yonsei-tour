Good place to learn,Pros:- Not crowded so it's a good place to learn to ski/ snowboard- Hardly any queue for the ski liftsCons:- Artifical snow which is very grainy- Lack of amenities
Ski trip ,"Just less than 1.5 hours bus ride from central Seoul. Not crowded so we had ample space to learn skiing. Slope for beginners is not that steep. If you don’t want to ski, there’s a sled area too. It has a foodcourt and foodstalls for snacks. "
Trying Snow sliding,"This is the last week for people to do snowing things.. The place so crowded, but still, the scenery is breath taking... I will come if i had a time.."
Day Ski / Sled with toddler,"visited in Feb 2016. Great resort, with really good ski slopes. Rental of ski equipment was decent (look for the discount coupons). Took the bearstown shuttle from City Hall station Exit 4 - super convenient. The only problem was the ski slopes / ski rental office, was a good 1-2 km away from the sled slope / sled rental office. They are not connected except by the main road. I had to walk with my toddler for nearly 30 mins before i could find it. My husband managed to join us via the ski slopes, which are not accessible except to ski-ers. I am hoping that they can provide some kind of shuttle service between the 2 points in the future. Food is aplenty there, at normal prices."
Nearest ski resort/ snow experience in Seoul,"We went there to tour our friends. We weren't sure if it was going to snow during their stay, so we brought them here abruptly. It's not as big as the other resorts in Korea, but I think it's good enough. We went there at night. Ski resorts at day and night both offer different kind of vibe. I didn't do any winter sport activities but just watched my friend learn snowboard. His instructor could speak English well. They did snowboarding for 2 hours. They had a great time. So, this is definitely a go-to for those seeking a ski resort without having to travel too far away from Seoul."
Very near the city... But... ,"I decided to go to this resort because of its distance to Seoul. It was just about an hour away and for a day trip it seemed like a great option. I tried skiing early this year in another resort and since it really wasn't for me, I wanted to try their sledding instead. First of all, there is really a lack of English speaking personnel in Bears Town. I went inside their Information booth to find that the attendant spoke VERY LITTLE English and couldn't communicate with me so much. I also found out just that day that they were fixing their sledding facility and that it was closed. Very disappointing but we had no choice but to go back to Seoul via a public bus which stopped over so many stations making my trip back twice as long. I believe they should improve on their facilities and service for foreign guests. "
Ski Near Seoul,"Great ski town with all inclusive facilities. There are condo, restaurant, cafe, convenience store and rent shop for ski equipment. Really recommended because you can reach there by bus number 11 from Seoul (I took from Gwangnaru station)."
It was really fantastic experience compared to other place in South Korea,"Firstly, It was my first skiing experience. I didn't expect to have ski in South Korea, But I was fascinated by the fact that there is ski resort near Seoul! (only 50 min from Jamsil Lotte hotel which I stayed that day) Snow was clean and clear, and facility was quite nice. Especially, accommodation was far better than other hotels near resorts. (I had visited resorts in Korea several times but not had skiing)"
