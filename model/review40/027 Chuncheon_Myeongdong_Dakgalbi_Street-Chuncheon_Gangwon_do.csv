Food hunting,"I think there are 3 dakgalbi streets if i am not wrong, this is near Myeongdong street. Many dakgalbi restaurants around here. Some are crowded with queues extended outside, some are near empty with staff standing outside the shop trying to usher people in. I got ushered in, didnt mind as due to my lack in the korean language, the lady that ushered me spoke english, albeit minimally. It was still better than struggling to order. Plus most dakgalbi places i asked only offer it for minimum 2 pax, here they allowed me to eat for 1 since i was solo."
MUST GO FOR FOODIES,"Not only does Chuncheon have great shopping, trekking and all sorts of outdoor activities but this is the home of Chuncheon Dakgalbi. This was the 1 single reason for taking the wife (and she shopped) was Dakgalbi Street. This is like eating the best heaven has to offer if you love a bit of heat and an incredible atmosphere of Korean Culture (and Soju).I wanted my wife to experience what I had many times before in my travels and she loved it. we had the most awesome day out."
Indeed the Best Dakgalbi,"We had Dakgalbi at the number 8 restaurant for dinner. Indeed is super yummy! I dont think i will get back the same taste anywhere else then Chuncheon! I am going to miss this Town!Not for children, its spicy!"
Dinner at Chuncheon,"I saw the review to eat the famous chicken at Chuncheon Myeongdong Dakgalbi street. It is easy to find in the Myeongdong area. There are many restaurant offer same food, the chicken cooking in the big flying pan. It is a wonderful experience eating there and the chicken is really delicious and I recommend if you will be there. There are no other choices other than chicken, simple dish cooking in a big flat pan and you can participate the cooking as well. Fun and amusing place to eat. "
Nice historical street ,Find out why the chicken is very significant for the town and why many restaurants are serving the dish. There’re street information and history in a few languages. 
Love Dakgalbi!,It is the dish this region is famous for! I love that there are so many choices and you can’t go wrong with any establishment that you choose!
Lotsa of food hare,"Was brought to this street by our tour guide to taste the famous dakgalbi at one of the restaurant. Interesting dish but honestly, not really to my liking. Apparently the street is filled with restaurants selling this dish. Outside on the street, there were a number of street food for one to try out as well."
I miss this place!,"Chuncheon Dak Galbi is well worth the trip from wherever you are in Korea. Get off the train at Chuncheon station and cab to Dak Galbi alley for some of the best food you will ever eat. I was stationed at Camp Page in 2001, and this place was my first stop every Friday night. Heading back soon, and even though Page is closed down, I will most definately take a weekend in Chuncheon for some Dak Galbi."
The famous Dakgalbi street,"A street with rows of restaurants selling only 1 item, Dakgalbi aka Stir-fry chicken. I would think any of the restaurants would taste nice since Dakgalbi is a must-try in Chuncheon. :)"
"It's tasty, but not that different from other shops in Seoul","We happened to be in the area and came to the Dakgalbi street to sample the signature food of Chuncheon. Dakgalbi is spicy chicken fried on hot plate, with cabbage and other veggies. The chicken is wrapped lettuce and eaten with rice and other cold sides. We just picked one with more people in it and it turned out to be tasty, albeit not very different from other shops selling the same dish in central Seoul.All in all, it's worth a visit if you're in the neighbourhood. But if you have a tight schedule, just pick a Dakgalbi shop in central Seoul."
Plenty of choices! if u are into dakgalbi that is..,"We came to Chuncheon for a 2 day stopover and had to visit this place. There are probably around 10 stalls all selling variations of dakgalbi and the one we tried was pretty good especially as it was cold in winter. If u are a big dakgalbi fan, then this is probably one place that u will have to visit once in your lifetime!"
Superb,This is where I fell in love with Makguksu! Eating it with teryaki chicken is the best combination. Makguelli is also good here! Love everything here!!!
Better restaurants in other parts,"Most places here cater towards tourists, so quality is a hit or miss...I prefer places not on this street, but it is more tourist friendly...and just fine for people not picky about their dakgalbi..."
Oh. My. Yumminess!!!,"The food here was amazing! Make sure you choose a restaurant that has lots of pictures of TV shows being filmed there. Chances are, that means it's a delicious place! See our video of it by searching 'Emily Taehee' on Youtube. Thanks!"
Tourist Friendly,Lots of choices of Dakgalbi but more or less the same whichever you choose. Taste is slightly different from other restaurants in Chuncheon as these ones are more tailored to tourists.
Great for Dalkgalbi Lovers!,"Accessibility: When you avail the Chuncheon City Tour Bus (KRW5,000), this destination is included in the tour course. If not, you can take the subway. From Chuncheon Station, take Bus No. 63 and get off at Chuncheon's Myeong-dong (approx. 10 min). When you see the chicken statue and the smell of dalkgalbi, you are in the right place.Food and Price: Most of the restaurants have a price of between 10,000-11,000KRW for 300 grams Dalkgalbi. The taste is good. You must try this dalkgalbi when you are in this area because this is their representative dish."
Dakgalbi!,"First time I had tried Dakgalbi on my table, heard a lot about Dakgalbi in Korea and this was the best experience Ive had by far in terms of Dakgalbi. We were served as always like lightning speeds but with efficiency not clumsiness like in Hong Kong. The food was excellent and tasty. Would surely recommend this place to friends and family."
Great dakgalbi,"We had a 4,000 Won discount courtesy of two tickets for the Soyanggang Skywalk (소양강 스카이워크). The choice of restaurants was excellent, and we had a huge portion of tasty dakgalbi with all the sides for a very reasonable price. Highly recommended!"
Take the plunge ,"Just back from a delicious meal of dakgalbi. Not knowing what to expect we picked one of the first restaurants we saw. It was busy and with a friendly usher at the door, we took the plunge. We were directed to a raised floor area with customers sitting cross legged around circular tables with central BBQ. No menus appeared just a large bowl of chicken, cabbage, noodles and various goodies. The staff cooked the lot in front of us and indicated when it was ready. Very tasty it was too. Great experience and good food. "
"real good taste,much better than those in Seoul","Many shops selling same dish, fried chicken, some shops have been survived many years, proved their quality, I walk ed to the middle part of the street, there is an old shop which their lady president also paid a visit, we found the taste was very good and many customers, to my surprise, 3 tables are Hong Kong people and when we leave, another group of 10 Hong Kong people lead by their Korean friends came, making there was not enough seat, I was surprised so many people in this shop in a quiet street in this cold night about 10 o clock. The price also very cheap."
Best Dakgalbi in the world,I have been there a week ago. You can walk from train station about 15 minute to Myeongdong. The Dakgalbi street locates there and too many restaurants where you can choose. 
One of the places you need to go to if you are in Chuncheon,"Chuncheon is famous for two foods: Dakgalbi and Makkooksu.... There is a ""Dakgalbi"" alley that has numerous Dakgalbi restaurants.... It is a very tasty meal and supposedly at no other place (like even Seoul) can duplicate the taste...."
Many restaurants to choose,"Price is not expensive, some of them offered chairs to sit in, instead of sitting on the floor. The chicken is not very spicy actually, but the portion may be more than you can have per person. Overall the taste is good. This is my first time to try this ""Dakgalbi""."
DELICIOUS!,"This is the delicious food ever in chuncheon. Im not lying, but recently i ate 8 times dalkgalbi. You must try"
One of the hot spots in Korea for Koreans.,"We were able to visit Chuncheon Dakgalbi street on a week night. Because of our timing, there wasn't the crowds that are typical at Korean tourist areas. It is basically an alley that is lined with restaurants all serving the same dish. The only difference is each restaurant has their own flair on the marinade sauce. We choose one of the more modern looking establishments. We also ordered the mild spiced but most places in the US would have labeled it HOT! It was a decent meal. We ordered for three because that how many was in our party but an order for two would have been enough. If nothing else, when you are talking with your Korean friends, they will be amazed and honored that you took the time to visit one of their vacation spots."
A Must when visiting Chuncheon,I think no one will miss to go to this famous Dakgalbi Street when you visit Chuncheon. There are numerous restaurant selling Dakgalbi and cold noodle. Dakgalbi is a typical Chuncheon style of cooking chicken. Very delicious and tasteful. A MUST to try!
Delicious and original dakkalbi ,"I went here with my friends after we visit Nami Island, it takes 20 minutes by taxi to chuncheon dakkalbi street. There you have lots of choices of the restaurants and you can already smell dakkalbi from the street gate :DThe food itself is very deliciously and the use the original dakkalbi recipes (unlike the ones in seoul that are bathed in melted cheese) so I think it's more traditional. Overall, glad I went, probably won't come again if I go only for the dakkalbi."
Spicy Chicken Heaven,"Chuncheon is an easy day trip from Seoul. Take the same route to Nami Island via the metro but get off at the last stop (Chuncheon) instead of Gapyeong. You may opt to take the bus to Chuncheon Myeongdong Street where Dakgalbi Street is located but a taxi ride is convenient and just as inexpensive if you're a group of 2 or more. Just tell the friendly ahjussi to take you to where the Dakgalbi is. You can walk around in Chuncheon Myeongdong and the traditional market called Romantic Market before eating and work up an appetite as the servings in any of the restaurants are huge!Most restaurants are priced the same so I choose where to eat by looking at where most of the clientele are. Or, as in the case of my last visit, since it wasn't very busy, where the ahjummas who invite you in are friendlier."
Worse than I expected,"Well, Chuncheon is very famous for Dakgalbi. But look at the long line and crowd. Also, I cannot say their Dakgalbi is more delicious than Dakgalbi store in Seoul. However, I still want to recommend Makguksoo."
Eat yourself silly,"This is a great place to try out the famous Dakgalbi chicken. But don't think that once you've tried one, you've tried them all! So try two or three different restaurants for different experiences. There are also some nice coffee shops or bars near by for a drink afterwards. Enjoy!"
A must visit place for shopaholics. ,Do not need any reviewTake a cab head to this street right now .HahaGood foodGood crowdVarieties of stuff to shopEconomical mask Nice seafood
worth to visit,It is a place that you should go when you visit Seoul. There are a lot of shops and stalls everywhere for you to explore. but you must not feel shocked to see the crowd there.
A must if you're in Chuncheon,"If you happen to be in Chuncheon then you should definitely have dinner somewhere on Dakgalbi Street. It's a narrow back road/alley off of Myeongdong Street. Probably 10-15 different Dakgalbi restaurants. The prices/menus are all pretty standard so I wouldn't rate over of another. There are a couple huge Dakgalbi Street signs at both entrances so it's hard to miss. However, if you're not in Chuncheon then it's not worth a trip outside Seoul."
A must if in Chuncheon,"I have visited Chuncheon Myeongdong Dakgalbi Street once. It is located in Myeongdong, Chuncheon and it is full off Dakgalbi restaurants. The street is usually crowded with Koreans and tourists flocking in for their famous Chucheon dakgalbi. I have only tried it once, as I don't really like chicken, but the time I've tried it, it was really good. It definitely is an absolute must if you are in Chuncheon."
a whole backstreet of dakGalbi restaurants,"Seriously, a while narrow street with more than 10 dakgalbi restaurants. Prices are pretty standard, abt 10-12000won per pax. Many serves nothing other than their standard single item menu, only options if you want pain or kimchi rice.It's a quaint street, narrow and easy to miss if not for the sign at entrance. "
Skin care shopping street,You will see few same brand shops at that area. It was a nice place to shop. 2 - 3 hours there should be enough. Please get ready your money to spend there...
Tourist Trap,"If you like over-priced, low-quality food, and long waits go here. There are hundreds of better dakgalbi restaurants dotted all over the city. If you go to Chuncheon, find a local and get them to take you to their favourite restaurant. I guarantee you it won't be on this street. Having said all that, it's worth visiting just to get your photo taken next to a giant plastic chicken."
If you want to try standard dakgalbi..,"This dakgalbi street is not so far away from chuncheon train station. It takes about 10 minutes by taxi. Most restaurants on the street serve dargalbi and one of them tastes average. I think dakgalbi is not a difficult food type to cook. If you visit Chuncheon, this path is a must-visit for sure though. "
"Visit only if you have ""extra time"".","From nami island i took a cab there ,it was a mistake it cost 42 000 won ,it takes about 25 min to 30 min .The 'right ' thing to do is from chuncheon train station take a cab there ,it will be cheaper below 5000 won. I paid 3500 won and it takes about 5 min.It is next to myeong dong chuncheon shopping area ,compare to seoul myeong dong ,it was so 'quiet' may be it was on monday.The whole street sell just 1 thing dakgalbi ,unless you do some homework ,you are at the lost as to which restaurant to go,basic rule, just choose the restaurant that have some customers.In my opinion ,dakgalbi just taste quite the same as the rest of the restaurant in seoul,we paid 25 000 for 2 person.nothing 'special' .I will recommend to people who are near that vicinity or for those who have some 'extra time' ,it is far as chuncheon is the last stop and 'street 'does not mean above 30 stalls ,you can also get dakgalbi in other part of korea."
Regular shopping area,"The area has loads of shops and resturants. The most notable aspect of the area is dakghalbi street, and at the end of the street they have a bazaar style area for bargain shopping with street vendors. Not much in the way of entertainment except a cinema, but plenty of places to get food and clothes. "
I don't want you to miss chunchon's best taste.,"It has been known that DAKGALBI camefrom chuncheon. Decades ago when Korea was still poor, one of chef started to serve mixed chicken with veggies, rice and noodle. It was delicious and spread all around chuncheon.Any restaurant in MYUNGDONG is above average and the menu is very similar.I bet You won't regret to enjoy DAKGALBI in chuncheon.If it is too spicy, you need to ask the waiter to add more veggies. After enjoying the chicken, you must enjoy the fried rice and noodle on the same plate.It is out of the world..."
smashing chicken,Loved the spicy chicken on offer here.. It is a specialty of the area apparently.. Must certainly give it a try.. I found the spice to be on the hotter side for my liking but could still certainly eat and enjoy it :)
Chuncheon Dakgalbi (Spicy Chicken) Street - Must Visit!!,"It was really easy to find this well known place for us to find it from the bus terminal, as we used the local taxi right after we got off from the bus and we paid only 3,000won to reach Myeongdong, Chuncheon. You can easily find the Dakgalbi (spicy chicken) street in Myeongdong area, a lot of shops for shopping and dining will be around you. But this unquie entrance gate sign of [ Dakgalbi - means spicy chicken Korean style BBQ ], we found it easily. It was lucky we knew how to write [ Dakgalbi ] in Korean though. ^^We smelled good and delicious BBQ meat, all of restaurants in this alley serve [ Dakgalbi - Spicy Chicken Korean style BBQ ]. We entrered one of restaurant, well, I forgot the restaurant name but it was few steps from the main gate of Dakgalbi street. We ordered it with Korean noodle dish with some drink. The staff of restaurant helped us a lot with smile and told us when is the time for eat. It was not spicy and we all enjoyed it a lot. I specially loved white rice cake inside, it was chewy. After we ate all meat, vege in hot pot - we ordered mixed rice with seaweed. It was really delicious and recommend you to try if you like Korean spicy and all side dishes. I think there is no doubt, all of restaurants in this street will serve very good and tasty [ Dakgalbi - Spicy Chicken Korean style BBQ ]. We all want to try again when we visit Chuncheon, Korea!!!"
Not-to-be-missed delicacy!,"We stayed 2 nights in Chuncehon and had the well-known Dakgalbi chicken as our lunch on the first day and dinner on the second day. Though eating the same dish (in two different restaurants) in a mere 2-day visit, we still never got sick of it!The price ranged from 10000-11000won per person. Four of us ordered 3 servings and it was more than enough to fill us up already. I would particularly recommend the restaurant which we had our lunch on the first day (a photo of the name of this restaurant was posted here). The service was excellent. The lady boss kept replenishing our kimchi and leafy vegetable (to be eaten with the main dish). There was a Chinese speaking waiter who explained thoroughly to us the way to go about eating this dish."
Vibrant shopping street!,"The highlight of my first weekend in Chuncheon: shopping along a busy, colorful street on a Saturday night ! There are Western shops like Nike lined up to typical Korean shops--there are shops of all kinds and sizes... And. McDonald's with its own Delivery Truck! There is a very inexpensive four-story equivalent of a US discount store...but with lots of little Korean souvenirs like the typical metal chopsticks used here. I loved it!"
