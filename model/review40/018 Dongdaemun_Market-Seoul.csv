Wholesale shopping,"A couple of stops from myeongdong where we stayed before reaching Dongdaemun. there is a lot of walking especially if you are not familiar with the area as we are tourists. Lots of merchandise and it will come out less expensive when bought wholesale. There are several specialty stores as well (such as those for fashion accessories, cooking and baking needs, etc)"
Food market for the food lovers,So much choice.. easy going.. good food.. made fresh.. browse through the market before you decide what and where you want to eat.. you might want to try it all and won't have space for all 
A super fun 2 hours!,Interesting place with nice local food. Very close proximity to the train station (Exit 9 of Hongik Univ Station) so its very very easily accessible. A must go if you are a first timer in Korea!
good price,"So kind of products you can find toys,bag,clothes with good price. But sales person do not know english. Therefore it is so hard to discuss. they are showing price with calculate machine it is realy problem."
Cheap and varieties of food.,I went to this market and tried all kinds of street food available in Seoul..the soju was cheap and the food excellent.Could not finish so many choices so need to come back again in future
Worth a look,Great variety of shops and stalls. There are all types clothes and goods for sale and plenty of food on offer
Night shopping,Lots of stores and street food options. Many western style malls but each mall offers essentially the same range of stores such as Adidas etc. Contrastingly local malls are full of toot and not particularly useful for foreigners. 
Perfect place to try lots of yummy local specialties,"Stall after stall selling what is seemingly the same food. I found places that looked the freshest and tried a lot of different dishes. I have no idea what I ate, but it was all good! "
Not a must-visit,"There are many restaurants and also shops selling clothings, shoes, bags. Nothing exciting. Not highly recommended. Visit only if you have time."
Large commercial district,"This is not one market, but is a large commercial district comprising of shopping malls such as Doota, Migliore, apM Place and traditional markets such as wholesale clothing, shoes etc. The iconic landmark is the Heunginjimun Gate. It is best to visit in the evening when it is lively, though crowded. Suggest you climb uphill for 5 to 10 mins just behind the Heunginjimun Gate, to have a great view of the surrounding area."
Worth walking around,Many small shops and restaurants nearby. Mostly young crowd. Evening is better to walk around. Easy to get to by subway
So so!,This area I found hard to find my way around for some reason - lots of shops but nothing I found very exciting. Part of the Old City wall is here a d that was worth seeing.
shop until drop,"its 24 hours malls! can't say it no more, just shop until you drop, any thing you need from head to toe are here "
Confusing even with tourist helpers,"When we visited, we approached the tourist helpers (wearing red vests) and I don't think they understood us as we were trying to get to the children's toy stores and also to street food stalls. There were only a handful of street food stalls outside of the big mall there, but many of the stalls on the side streets were closed."
Good place to shop ,"There are many wholesalers located inside buildings, and they sell things ranging from clothes to shoes, bags, food etc. There were also many small street food stores located on the roadside, convenient stores were also aplenty. There is also international food brands such as Starbucks located inside shopping Malls."
Amazing,"The colours, the noise, the smells, the lights, the people, the massive amount of products ... everything is like a punch in your senses. A great experience."
street stalls and food in the market and side streets,"lots of lovely food to try but not for me as I have food issues. Lovely copies of leather, handbags, shoes, clothes etc. Very reasonable prices. Market washuge. Enjoyed our short time there and then drove around momumental places"
SpeakingEnglish is Rare,"We ate lunch at Dongdaemun Market. We ate pig feet, tteokboki and fish cake soup. This is not recommended for people who have weak stomach. The food is not fancy. But it’s cheaper than the restaurants around. There’s no English speaking zone here. Hehehe. Good thing that I know how to read and speak Korean language."
Local Brand Shopping,"Korean local brands of clothing, luggage, handbags, misc items are available in Doota Mall. Price is very reasonable and variety to choose. also a bunch of street food eateries around. I really enjoyed the shopping and the quality of the items"
Good to visit if you're into shopping,"Enjoyed our visit here, and a great place to stop if you are looking for souvenirs and shopping! Lots of street stalls, also a few food stalls."
AWESOMEE!!,Awesome market... make sure bring your empty stomach... because they have great food as well... lots of fabrics and great shopping as well..love it!!
Had to see what it was all about,"Not too much variety, average prices. Many floors fulls with the same products. Most stuff can be found in the US cheaper. "
All you can buy,"One of the best markets in Seoul. If you're a fashionista, this is a place you must visit. There's flea market area, as well as indoors shopping malls if it's too windy, too cold or too hot outside. One mall didn't open till 8 pm! Although it's not quite 24 hours as most shops will close by 10 pm. Wear comfortable shoes as you'll be walking around a lot!"
Good shopping place,This is one of the places that you have to visit when you are in Seoul. It has a lots of Korean Fabric to choose from and lots of clothing line for those into fashion. It is recommended to spend minimum 2-3 hours. Its such a huge shopping street with lots of shops. Great shopping place.
Good if you want the experience,"Went mostly to Milgore and Good morning, APM, rest of mall seems to be ghost town, short for some tour group and i think the locas mostly go for the retail side. we exit from DPP station and walk towards Dongdaemun station, but most of the retail opens around or after midnight. If you go during this season, will be all winter/thiick clothes, and accessories, so not much shopping feel, as compare to Myeongdong or Termainal station, but its still worth the trip if you wanna feel the vibe or overnight shopping"
Neat!,"Went here at night, lots of clothing shops. Few food vendors, which all smelt good! Lots of shops to see!"
Excellent market to find wonderful fabrics!,"Textile amateurs: you will find everything here! Beautiful printed Korean fabrics, everything from needles to buttons to tailors! I find it fascinating. Enjoy!"
Not really 24 hours ,"Although it is a 24 hours market/shops/malls, when I went there at 10pm, the individual shops were closed. Only shops in the malls were open. I guess you have to go at daytime. Most shops are wholesaler. So you got to buy in bigger quantities, like 10 pairs of socks, etc. Note: Products are cheap but the qualities are also not top notch. Fair enough. "
Huge market,"I went for the 3rd time today and it was so big I got lost. You can spend the whole day walking around and see something new along the way. The first two times I came was late at night. Daytime for me was better as you can look futher around the area. I came down from Naksan mountain trail as the sun was setting so it was a different view. However, the lights at night are pretty, too. The first time I came, there was some kind of concert happening outside Migliore building and people were dancing around. Happy place!"
Peter G,"Promoted a being open 24/7, was however pretty much fully closed at 7pm when we arrived, very disappointing"
Traditional,"not your typical street market.check out the different herbs available.Good to go if you want to see a different, perhaps more traditional side of korea"
Eye opener,"The market actually consist of a large area encompassing multiple malls and streets lines with wholesale shops. Note that they are mainly selling in bulk, hence asking for a single piece will get you the NO-NO answer...or they hike up the price REALLY high. It is a good place to visit as you will find many buyers, presumably boutique owners from HongKong, China, Japan etc haggling over the number of pieces they are getting and the price with these stalls. If you are looking to buy 10 pairs of the same socks for 6000 Won then this is the place for you. Do also note that most of them will chase you away when they hear you speak English, but do try and try again with the next stall and you might just get that nice looking sweater for 5000 Won :)"
"Try the local food, cheap and delicious","There are few restaurants which are hiding in between of the alleys. I have tried out 2 of it and found the one near to public toilet and run by all ""ajiman"" taste best."
You can find anything here,"My goodness, what a huge market and it first opened in 1905 and has grown bigger ever since. It consists of over 20 shopping malls in 10 blocks, 30,000 specialty shops and 50,000 manufacturers. We saw about 50 shops in a row all selling tools etc, then another 20 selling something else. Our main reason for going here was to buy some fridge magnets (which we bought for less than half price compared to souvenir shops) and an original Taekwando uniform which we got for a good price. there are many money changers scattered around the area offering favorable rates, restaurants, fast foot outlets, clothe stores and just about any shop you needed."
This market feels HUGE! Plan in advance ;),"This is a huge market and I would really suggest you to plan in advance what you want to get and also an approximate idea about how it should look or what it should look like, or at least what you like! :). It is easy to get lost if you are a one or a few times visitor, especially if you start to stray from the ""main streets"", take shortcuts, get up on set of stairs and down another... I bought a tailor-made Hanbok here and it is very difficult to fend yourself off nice sellers. As I do not speak any Korean, what finally tipped over when it comes to choosing seller, was that we found one that spoke english! Ordering one in english was hard enough! and it took several hours before I had picked out colors, decoration, style and had my messurements taken. This is a very special Hanbok for me as it is the first time I return to Korea after being adopted to Sweden, so the choice of design was very important ;). If you are ok with one of the pre-mades, there are several shops both here in Dongdaemun Market and in the Gwanjang Market ""next door"". I would absolutely recommend a visit here! Prepare a full day! "
Prices comparable with other markets,"Though I noticed that the reviews have been a bit harsh but honestly I did not face any. Yes, the shopkeepers here show some attitude but the quality and the price at this place is comparable to other markets. Since it is close to Marriott, a convenient shopping destination close by."
Touristy ,"This is a shopping district and famous for the tourists around. The manners and the shop owners here seems to be too comfortable with their business and most of the time, not very welcoming. For me, I’m spending my money and I have a choice where do I spend it. "
Shopping at the risk of being chased by hostile owners,"The most horrible shopping experience. It wasn't like that when I visited same place 2 years ago. The prices were so much more expensive than before and than in Myeondong. Plus, the owners were so hostile and I even witnessed a shop owner cursing and chasing customers away! My friend was also badly treated and left us very bad impression of them! The recent trip made me blacklist the stretch of shopping malls in Dongdaemun and will never return again!"
Shopping,"This market and the surrounding shops are worth visiting, good to just see see look look. Prices are slightly more expensive than other areas in Seoul. The same item you may have to pay extra 1000 to 3000 won as compared to elsewhere. Most shops are open at night, day time may have to explore the shopping malls which there are many in the vicinity."
So rude,For more travel and food journey on Instagram @oppakulinerI'm not gonna back here for sure! They're known really well as the reference if you want to go shopping at Seoul but the fact they're not welcoming you at all. They ask you to buy your products and when you asking for discount and they're not okay with it and just scolded us with their language. I'm not gonna going back here
Wait until the evening to visit,"Huge buildings full of clothing and textiles and outside lots of street food vendors. Worth a visit but go in the evening as the market doesn't get up to speed until later. Lots of locals there shopping, not really the place to go if you are looking for cheesy souvenirs."
A best place to shopping till you drop,"Because they open until dawn. With so many shopping list you can find here.A huge complex to explore and do not forget to try the local food and delicacies. Bargain power is important, because you need to bargain some stuff to get a best price, otherwise you will get an expensive charge for only a small casual bag.Local snacks and foods also plenty in here."
Flea Market Shopping,"There are just clothes.. EVERYWHERE. You can never fall short of options for clothing and accessories for any dress code or occasion. It was quite a sight to see the number of vendors out on the street setting up racks of clothings for sale but after browsing through some of the items on sale, the quality of stitching and the price tag attached to them did not appeal to me. I would have preferred to spend that same money on items in H&M or Zara (yes, the clothes at the Dongdaemun Market weren't exactly cheap!)."
Open forever!,"Went here at 8pm and stayed til 3am. If you love shopping, this is the place for you. So so many shopping areas to visit!"
Bring ur frds shopping toghether,"Dongdeamum is famous by the wholesales market of garments n accessories , this is is a good place for who loves korean fashion style ,u can buy many not that expensive but similar to style of latest big brand , but if u want to shop on wholesales market its better to shop with ur frd cuz they ask for minimum quantity."
"Textile, Hardwares, puppy's stuff...","We bought tons of puppy's stuff here as the price is so much cheaper than my home country. Not to mention the style and patterns are so much more attractive. Other than that, stuffs like household items, textile, potteries etc are also available. "
This market close early ,The Dongdaemun market I walked across from the subway station closed early unlike other Dongdaemun shopping centers nearby . But some of the food stalls still open at night and help to direct me to Doota mall nearby 
Wanting to buy souvenirs in bulk,"Me and friend were looking for some cheap souvenirs and we expected to buy a lot, hoping the shopkeeper would give us a better price. Our plan worked well, we bought quite a lot and the shopkeeper gave us a discount."
Massive Market,Dongdaemun Market is a massive shopping complex that you can easily get lost in. Fabrics and textiles are big here and it seems like night time is right time to get the feel of Dongdaemun Market. You need time to explore. The place is a rabbit's warren and there are new discoveries around every corner.
Great place to buy toys,"Stumbled across this street in Dongdaemun and ended up a costly experience in a good way. Coming out of exit 4 (?) from the station and walking about 30 metres there is a street on the right totally dedicated to toys. They have everything and at a much better price than my home country (Malaysia). My kid loved it, of course. Bring an empty suitcase if planning to go here. Many things were half the price as compared to where i am from and they had many interesting toys from their own brands."
Shopping shopping,"If u love shopping, u will love this place. For me I’m not someone who love shopping so it’s abit boring for me. There will be good buys on the streets and some street foods as well"
姜虎東白丁烤肉,This is our Korean BBQ trip. So we tried many Korean BBQ with different cooking tools. 今晚試了在台灣曾紅極一時的美虎東銅盤式烤肉！配著生菜沙拉和烤蛋及泡菜湯又享受了完全韓國風味的料理！
Fabric shopping ,"Huge market full of fabrics, trims and other crafting needs. Good fun especially if you love to sew! Check out Happy Quilt on the 5th floor, B section for cute prints. Lots of lace on the 2nd floor. "
Shopping and street food,Located near Seoul City. Plenty of street stalls that sell number if products and items. There is a section that just sells only footwears. If you see this bakery place stop by! The food selections are really good. They make it fresh and on the spot. 
Enjoyable shopping at night ,"There’re many attractive wholesale shops here. Most of them start to open from early evening, and many customers are still here even after midnight. I love shopping here and seeking good bargains."
Hidden wholesale stores,"There are many underestimated hidden wholesale stores in dongdaemun, which offer unrealistic prices for even small quantities. People just can't find them due to the stores' poor marketing abilities. Instead of the big fancy dept stores, try walking thru the allies near dongdaemun station and look through the windows. Some of them will surprise you their English skills."
Clothes/Toy market,"Clothes market:Endless shopping of korean style clothing, mostly only one size. I'm an European size 38, which translates into a korean XXXL. The bargaining was mostly fun, as they are competitive with each other as they sell many of the same goods.Toy/stationary market:This was absolutely fantastic, we really enjoyed this part of the market. Although many brands are fake, we could find a lot of enjoyable toys and gadgets. This was absolutely heaven for the kid in me. Bargaining is additionally possible, although many of the toys already come cheap."
SHOPPING SHOPPING SHOPPING,"if you travel to Korea for Work and no time for shopping, just go to Dongdaemun in the Evening. They are open until 5-6am so you can do those extra shopping.Street foods are everywhere but cant find HALAL foods.Wholesale district. buy in bulk!! everything is cheap if you buy in bulk. Korean Made Bags are cheap here..and Good quality."
Shopping ..Shopping ...Shopping,You go here to shop and you don't regret it there are endless markets and malls some with opening hours from 10 a.m. to 5 a.m. so virtually many shoppers keep on shopping till last hours of taking flight out from Seoul .Great variety on clothes for all .
Shopping!,"If you are looking for affordable/cheap finds from clothes to bags to blankets to socks etc, Dongdaemun is the perfect place for you. You can even request to mix and match the bulk items ie 10 pairs of socks bundled together for the price of ₩5000 as long as they are of the same price. Tips: for stalls located by the streets, prices may drop just before closing time. Start with the stalls located by the streets first, when that section is closed, you can try the ones underground. Be sure to wear comfortable shoes and have smaller denomination of bills with you :)"
Dongdaemum market is a shopping area,"Dongdaemum market can be confusing. It is not ""a market"". It is a huge shopping area which includes shopping malls, outlet malls, department stores and street vendors selling contemporary and traditional Korean merchandise. The best part of this area is the Dongdaemum Gate which contrasts strongly with its modern environment.Dongdaemum Market does has a lot of offer: garment making materials, sewing and craft materials, clothing, accessories, food, retail and wholesale. You have to know what you want to buy, then focus on the particular sessions of the market / building. Price is reasonable and you need to bargain. We spent a few hours in this area. Personally I prefer Myeongdong."
Lively street food,"Part of the larger market, the street food sellers come to life in the evening (although they are there all day) when tourists and locals alike come by for traditional Korean food. There's actually very little to choose from as the many, many vendors are pretty much all serving exactly the same stuff for the same prices, so just choose a stall you like the look of, sit down and order. Most places don't speak English, but they all carry English menus. Just point. Beers and rice wine available too. Cash only."
Best shopping area,"Everything is here. Clothes, shoes, pets, toys, sweets Easily accessible from Dongdaemun and Dongdaemun History and Cultural park station. There is Migilore and Doosan mall for all sorts of cloths with latest Korean fashion. Bargain they will settle it for you. Lot of eating options in and around. Opposite of Migilore and next to DDP there is a shoe market. There lies a pet market its just aswome. Toy street and Stationary street are very good."
Best market in Seoul!,"This outdoor market was the best part of our trip! Not to be missed, it was exactly everything an outdoor market should be. It reminded me of the Middle East Souks, with all the stalls and shopkeepers. Bargains are here to be had, and haggling on prices is expected. You can spend the whole day here, with so much to see and do. Also a great place for interesting food choices. Lots of fun!"
Ummmm!,"A little confused when we walked along. Most of shopping (cloth) are in the buildings. Some food stalls, they are all the same Korean street food, are along the street outside. Lots of restaurants locate on the street at the back of the buildings. We went for a BBQ restaurant. It was o.k. In front of few buildings usually have an event. Seems young people love to hang out here. Has to admit nothing special to me."
Nice,"Big designer market with a lot of Nice things, litle shops and cafes. Middle priced compared to Europe "
wholesale market,located in the central. this area is full of wholesale markets and shops. you will get all types of products in this market. you need full day to explore this area. worth a visit for shopaholic.
If you are in the resale biz....,It's pretty huge area and its section by section according to the particular merchandise....If you were looking for hats then you will need to be in certain section for tons of tons of individual vendors little shops there for you to bargain with. However its better if you are familiar with the price already...otherwise they don't like if you haggle for long time and end up not buying....lol 
"Nice area, a little old for wholesale market","Dongdaemun is a very good place to by fashion's products, the shops are incredibly open from 10am to 5am so you have much more than enough time for shopping, pricewise is acceptable, the area is well connected by 3 metro lines very easy to go and well spend your times and moneys :)"
Nothing special,Nothing special to this night market. Some average clothes and not much food about as the food stalls have all been closed according to the Tourist Information Point that we visited in the market area. Boring really.
To big and unorganized ,It's a big market....to big! And it's unorganized bcuz there is not 1 market you can go to....its a big area with different things to see. You need to know what you looking for in order to find right place. If you don't have much time in Seoul....you can skip this market and focus on other things to see. But if you have time....give it a go....its fun to be lots there 
Times Square of Seoul,This place looks pretty much like the Times Square .. tall buildings with LCD screens all around . Lots of shipping malls . Must include as part of the Seoul itinerary . 
Many shops!,There are many different shopping malls at the dongdaemun area! I recommend going to the good morning city mall for a great selection of clothes at affordable prices! You can also bargain for a lower price at the shops. 
A haven for women,"There are lots and lots of malls in this one area such as Doota mall, Lotte, Good morning mall and Magliore mall. They are all next to each other. Women can spend hours in these malls given the huge variety of clothes, shoes, skin care and accessories. Just about every taste is catered for here. Some sort of skin craze is definitely in the area as storeys of skin care products can be found. Product prices ranges from cheap to very expensive depending on the mall you enter. Good vibes and great shopping for women."
Fun!,"Fun place to walk around and find interesting things! Good stop if you're in the area, but if not.. not sure I'd seek it out."
Night Visit,"This place is woman haven and will shop until they drop, Girls/women will be happy to come here to spend as much as they like. Of course there are also many food stalls and the many Korean taste. Also don't forget about the many beautiful buildings here and try to buy a cup of coffee to admire the night scene.There are also low-end and high-end items to select from. Take your time to enjoy this shopping therapy."
Shopping haven,"This place is massive. There's different streets for different kind of stuff. Went to Toys Street and got some cool kids lunch boxes (things are not price tagged so you have to ask the price). There are buildings selling all kinds of clothing. Locals come here to buy things in bulk amounts/wholesale. Some of the shops you do need to haggle. Bought a handbag for 15,000won when the seller initially wanted 35,000won. Try to avoid going on weekends as that's when it's busier."
nice place to find souvenirs,"just walking distance to Myengdong area, the hotel where we stayed.it's a complete shop to find clothes n things in with affordable price..only have 1 hour to looking around there, so we focused on buying Korean souvenirs..a must visit for souvenirs!"
Lovely market and shopping street full of food stalls,"Spend a good few hours going around here w my wife, had a really good time and shops are interesting"
Shopping,Many locals shop in this area. It has a variety of stores where you can find wares of every kind. Street food is also available.
Interesting place!,"Not bad to just walk around and shop around. Prices are average, not the cheapest place to shop in South Korea. DDP and a few other attractions are nearby so it's nice to just walk around. Many things to see and feel in the market as well. I believe the pictures uploaded by other reviewers are good enough to show you what's here. A must visit place! "
Traditional market for locals,"It's filled with goods lining along the entire street. It's probably better visited in the evening or night. We were there in the morning and the whole market still feels sleepy. As it's winter, most of the goods were thick warm blankets of different sorts, warm jackets, gloves, beanies etc. It's not bad just to take in the local culture, lifestyles, understanding what would locals like. "
"A ""big festive"" area :)","Quite festive ""especially in the evening"", this area around the big intersection of Eulji-ro & Jangchungdan-ro (with the interesting-shaped Dongdaemun Design Plaza on one side of the intersection) is where this ""generally-termed"" market is which can actually be divided into its indoor part and the outdoor part: the indoor part is the big department stores such as Lotte World, Doota & some others brightly lit up in the evening (beautiful with their lights just looking from outside especially Lotte World with its multi-colored-lit-up honeycomb kind of exterior) really ""quite inviting"" to go in and see what's inside for which I'm actually kind of regretful not having done that (gone inside), and the outdoor part is the mobile kiosks spread out here & there along the sidewalk on one side of Jangchungdan-ro from the big intersection all the way to the popular Cheonggyecheon Stream (about a 10-minute walk heading north from the intersection, and for me that was sort of reminiscent of the Chiang Mai Night Market in Thailand). And I did get a chance to buy from one of the kiosks some souvenir key chains of Korea and to look at some Joseon-era-themed coasters (for a coffee table) although I didn't buy that beautiful little set.Coming by subway, Dongdaemun History & Culture Park Station (on Lines 2, 4 & 5) is where to get off, then go out of Exits 10, 11, 13 or 14 and you'll be pretty much right at the big intersection which as mentioned above is the ""heart"" (but not necessarily the ""center"") of the Market. Also, the Great East Gate (also called Dongdaemun Gate but the official name is Heunginjimun) beautifully lit up in the evening is just about a 10-minute walk north from the big intersection (the same way as going to Cheonggyecheon Stream through the outdoor area with the kiosks as mentioned above or walk on the side of the Design Plaza where there are no kiosks, and that big gate is pretty much just across the stream)."
"Food stalls, oh my","I'm not much of a shopper, but you must come through one of these markets for yummy eats. I had a breakfast bowl of dumpling soup -- glorious! Fresh and pickled vegetables piled into the broth, enormous dumplings packed with shrimp and vegetables. Stands everywhere in the morning. Nice older women run them, and I cannot speak Korean, but smiles translate all."
Dongdaemun Market,Lot of shopping and variety all over this area. Right by the Mariott hotel and the subway station. Cheap clothing can be found.
24 hour shopping (well almost - open 10 am until 5 am),"Who on earth comes here at 4 in the morning to buy socks or any of the merchandise on sale here: clothes, electronics, homeware etc. Floor after floor, corridor after corridor, building after building, filled with millions of goods. And it's open from 10am until 5am. We arrived just after 11pm just to check it out (shopping is kryptonite to me). An interesting approach to consumerism."
Teens shop for trendy sweatshirt and jeans ,"It is less busy as before and lesser china tourists this season. But the place is huge and if you want to spent the night browsing all the apparels for woman, man, teens and children. Sports and casual and winter, shoes and bags. This is another place not to be missed. But note : Korean size is smaller than usual Asian size. So don't be disappointed if you can't fit into their largest size. My teen came to buy her rip tight jeans and shorts and sweatshirts and wallet. She is the 'winner ' of the day as she got her bargain. Except for some Malls like Doota and and LOTTE FINITI, some of the small shops do not proper dressing room. So you have to do Teh dongdaemum style : wrapped a wide 'Sarong' skirt around and changed . It was very awkward ! I found a Korean design bag store which has pretty decent trendy design and hand made handbag at DOOTA. Owner willing to give me special discount if I pay in cash and have local tax deducted on the spot. "
Clothes Shopping,It's good to try exploring the underground market as well the shopping malls nearby. And the Dongdaemun Design Plaza is just walking distance. You can find some cheap finds here.
Typical Market where Locals shop for daily groceries,"A typical market where locals shop for their daily groceries and herbs like gingseng.Great for those who likes to experience localized lifestyle and do not mind smell & wet feet. If keen can even grab some fresh & cheap fruits on the go, its strawberry, mandarine oranges and persimmons season in Nov/Dec.Not suitable for baby stroller and too large a group. The walk ways are narrow and will inconvenience the locals./"
Tourist trap,Lots of things to see and eat but the food and souvenirs are not cheap especially at the Main Street!Come here to taste local street food but prepare for the crowd. There are information staff for visitors walking around in red attire if you have any questions
"Branded and cheaper stuff, all are here.",The place has a new version where big and modern shopping complexes are. The price is more or less the same as any other shopping areas in the city. But just walk outside and across the street is the cheaper type of market. It looks more like a flea market where the lanes between the stalls are narrow. Here you can get goods much cheaper than the city and the modern complexes. The price is not fixed so you can bargain.
Toy Street is pretty awesome,"We only visited the toy street part of this market so I can't comment on the rest - although it doesn't seem to be a traditional ""market"" but a lot of shopping centres. The toy street was pretty fun for my six year to visit and good for presents - a lot cheaper than buying in the tourist areas such as Insadong or Myeong Dong and not too far to get to either. Also we didn't seen the same stuff here as in Namdaemum so if you are looking for toys this is the place to come. "
Lots of flea market type street shopping!,"My daughter is tiny so she is forever shopping. We heard that this area was good shopping and that the center stayed open until 5 a.m. It's all true but just too much cheap no name stuff selling at what should be lower priced. Lots of knock off wallets and purses, not bad prices for their look. $10 shades were nice. Looked at some of the Korean bedding, great prices. I may go again in a taxi just to pick up the bedding!"
very disappointed,I heard about this market and that it is supposed to be one of the best. I went into this nice looking one and it was really expensive. So after looking at the prices at the first floor i just went out in the long building close to that. It seemed like a whilesale market and there where no people. The aisles were very narrow and 70% were huts. After walking for 10minutes i just wanted to go home.
A Show Heaven,"This place is like a shoe heaven for shoe lovers! You can shop for all kinds of shoes, for men, women or children, whatever shapes, sizes and material you want, from PVC to leather to suede. There may or may no be a need to haggle but if you can pull through the language barrier, they only cost slightly less than mall prices, but hey, you're gonna LOVE the variety!"
dongdaemun,located in dongdaemun near the doosan plaza adn dong daemun plaza. Place to find food with many locals. I eating live gurita here
Terrible.,We came here thinking great market and bargain. But it is totally not a very sad and busy area. Some people might find the appeal but not us.Is mainly for wholesalers and people who needs someone to do some job for them. Is hot and a mess.
So much stuff!!,"Interesting place for a walk through. There is pretty much everything here for sale. The ground level is mostly underwear, socks and sports wear. But they mostly sell in bulk. The upper levels don't open up until the evening. About a 5 minute walk from Dongdaemun station. "
Shopping,"If u are fashionista, you must visit this place!!!Don't come in the morning, they are open around 8pm (especially men shop). But men shop is not easy to find. I went to a building which on 3rd-4th floor, there is whole men shop. Sorry i don't what the building name"
Shopping Shopping,"The place has changed new compare when first visited in year 2000. But still, endless shops! However, the prices are expensive and less discounted. I didn't buy anything there since the prices are expensive."
So so shopping,"It was very hot on the day of our visit so that made it worst. Dongdaemun has a mixture of shopping malls and streets where you walk from shop to shop. The walk can be quite difficult because of the heat. Young children and the elderly might have s tough time. The malls were typical malls. We went to a street that sold toys and stationery. There were good buys to be found. Stationery sold here is cheaper if you buy in bulk, they give you additional discounts. I'm wary about buying toys here though. But at your own risk because I don't think these toys are regulated for safety. There is a better toy shop with Lego banners hanging outside. Here you can get Lego, Tomica, etc ( the better toy brands) cheaper."
Shopping and Shopping,"There are many shopping areas in Seoul and this is one of them. It is more well-known due to it being close to Dongdaemun. However, prices are more expensive than other more local markets not too visited by tourists (one of them is that local market right opposite of my Hotel Altrium). If you want to buy in bulk then they will give you a discount. If you love shopping then sure ....for me, it was just a quick visit since I was in the area. I didn't buy anything there since other places such as Bupyeong is cheaper"
Only go if you need to buy in bulk,Endless shops!Timeless designs!Never enough time!I had never seen that many clothes shops under a roof.Seriously this is the place where you can shop till you drop.Clothes are of a wide range of designs and prices.A heaven for fashionistas and clothes retailers.Bet even if you come here everyday chances that you get into the same shop is extremely low.
One day is certainly NOT enough!,"Thousands of vendors from top end fashion to basement market stalls and everything in between.Food stalls, easy to get to with transport and close to other attractions like the Dongdaemun Design Plaza."
Lot of people - very crowdly,"Lots of shops, everything u need you could find here, cheap cloth, shoes and different stuff, 7% made in China ) But must visit!"
Good shopping place. ,It has many subway lines e.g. line #5 #4 etc. So you can enjoy long shopping. Its specialty is clothings. 
Shopping!,"Lots of clothes at a bargain (you need to also bargain a lot, I got a jacket at kwn$55000, that's from kwn$120000 down to $55000. Imagine that!) lots of accessories, cloth, great place to do shopping if you are in the fashion industry!"
"Excellent teen fashion, big selection, good value, crazy hours!","My wife and daughter (then 13) went wild at the all night clothing mall, Doota, in the Dongdaemun Market. Dongdaemun is famous for its all night markets of many kinds. Doota is one mall carrying very fashionable, good quality, ""cute"" (I'm told) clothing. For some reason, the Korean sizes and styles fit a moderately sized teen ager from the US very well. The fabrics and designs are just right, and yet unique so you get to fit in and also stand out. We bought so much we had to ship some back. But, unlike the things from a US mall that seem to get discarded or passed on very early, these Seoul treasures fetch many compliments and get a real workout in her wardrobe. The trip has become major bragging material."
Haven for shoppers,"One of may shopping haven for shoppers. Silk to seaweed! Literally shop till you drop! Don't forget to get discounts (; ahjussi, kaka juseyo! kkkkkk!"
Fascinating ,"This is literally a shop-till-you-drop market. Inexpensive varieties of clothes, shoes, costume jewelry, sports related items, socks... Etc. can be found here at this market. This area has a lot of local street food stores. They came alive when night falls. To me, it was fascinating to watch the logistics of product delivery and bargaining going on in different languages, everyone holding a calculator. This area can get stuffy and warm. Be warned. "
Vibrant place,This is a vibrant and dynamic place with a buzz all its own. I must confess that I did not buy anything from the market but sometimes browsing in itself can be quite fun and I thoroughly enjoyed my sojourn through here. Do visit if in the vicinity.
Not really good but not bad too,"I don't really like here but it is ok if you wanna looking for clothes ,I think here a little expensive rather than bangkok"
Fascinating shopping culture ,"Most tourists head directly to the main shopping towers such as Doota. This would be a mistake as the prices there are retail. If you're heading to Dongdaemun you need to know these retailers buy from wholesalers located in the streets around these buildings. If your time permits, walk around the surrounding streets and you'll be able to buy everything at one third the retail price. It's truly a shoppers paradise. You just need to know a few Korean phrases, find the stores, and then shopping heaven is there for you. "
Shop till you drop,The best place in my opinion to shop through the night.Great deal unbelievable price and wonderful atmosphere!
A wonderful shopping experience,We delved into Dongdaemun markets during our time in Seoul and thoroughly enjoyed wandering through them for ages looking at the varied wares and items for sale. Was definitely a different type of market to those we had seen elsewhere in the world and thoroughly enjoyable chatting with the locals while bargaining our way through.
A walk through the corridors,"It was an excellent experience for me. It was more or less like ""Parrys corner"" in Chennai, except for well maintained stalls having almost everything that one could possibly get under a roof. Any one who is interested in jewelry making or crafting will love this place. A must visit for all the ladies who love ""cute and adorable"" stuff!!!"
another shopping heaven in seoul!!!,do not forget to bargain here !!. lot of shops if you love to buy footwear. Besides the malls that are across the street. there is also a wholesale market for lingerie here.Many face and skin products shops are also here !!!
24 hour shopping!!!,"This is serious stuff. Shopping malls that open until 4 or 5 am. Street markets that open throughout the night. This is literally 24 hour shopping. Bangkok, Singapore, Hong Kong and Tokyo may be shopping havens but this is like Shopping Paradise. If you are a shopaholic, I'm not sure you can get out alive really. If you are not, I suggest you should still come and be really amazed at the amount of shopping that can be done. Clothes, clothes everywhere!! I also love the neon lights and the vibrancy and the atmosphere. And to be fair, the actual Dongdaemun gate is here and there is a majestic futuristic looking structure right in front of the malls that makes good photo taking."
Too Much to Choose From,"I was overwhelmed by the size of this market but my daughter-in-law, who is South Korean, absolutely loved it. I had to remind her that everything she bought was going to have to go home on the plane with us. ;-)"
Quite overrated,"If we are talking about Dongdaemun, everyone would say that it is the place to go but I had walked down the long market and found nothing of interest. Its not even as cheap as mentioned and it closes so early that you will definitely don't feel like coming here again. Who knows, some other people might feel that this is a good place but not me."
Overrated Market,"There are really lots and lots of shops, however the quality are low, the place is a little stingy, Myeongdong is a much better shopping district."
Shopping Haven in Seoul,"the Pyounghwa Clothing Market is made up of 7 buildings of market style stores. In comparison with China, it is much cleaner and nicer but the deals are also not as good. Having said that, I did see some great deals.The lau is very organized and shopkeepers pleasant with most speaking English. They are willing to haggle but getting prices very low would be an exception.There are also all the requisite Korean beauty and skin care stores along with restaurants and coffee shops.I was there in early February and the cold weather prevented me from exploring too much outside, stayed mostly within the buildings. Worth a visit, best shopping I found in Seoul."
It was closed,"Went there on 7/2/2016. We took a nice walk along the stream from the station to get there. When we get there, apart from a few eating areas which are open. the rest are closed. Later only we get to know that it's close for a few days for the New Year celebration. What a let down. Saw a few groups facing the same scenario like us. Better check the calendar before you start off."
A huge complex selling mostly clothes and accessories,A shopping complex consists of small shops selling mostly clothing and accessories items. Worth the visit if you are around the area.
Shop til drop,"For you shoppers, this is a must place to go. Lots of fancy thing, affordable prices, cute and unique model. Many accessories and clothes and all of stuff you may looking for. Located in the center of Seoul, this place will not be missed! Go shop!"
Shopping Haven,There are lots of stalls offering a wide range of products from clothes to shoes. We went there and bought souvenir items like ref magnets and shirts for a very reasonable price. We ate on one of the many food stalls that offer hot noodles. Parking may be a concern but there are valet parking in the area.
Worth a visit,"Worth experiencing as this markets ends around 5am. Some of the shopping centers are also opened till quite late. Besides market stall, there's a lot of local snacks, food and stuff worth trying, so don't eat too full before u visit. "
Overwhelming shopping paradise,"If you're looking for anything about fashion, you'll find this place is just paradise. Not only fabrics and trims, but tons of wholesale clothes are going to fascinate your mind. The stores in the market open at night usually but you can find some wholesale stores in the daytime as well. (THE OT, Chung-pyung-hwa, etc...) For more details about Dongdaemun market, the blog post I linked might help you."
Very good night market.,"Very good night market. July August : average 20C at night. December January February : average -15C at night Don't worry, we have indoors. Excellent place for wondow shopping. It has beautiful DDP building and Cheongyeocheon stream. 24 hours except just short break in the early morning. :)"
Basically shopping paradise,"Strictly for fashion shopper and there are thousands of stalls here so it would be impossible to cover them all. For the sake of convenience, just drop by Miglorie and/or Hello APM. Do bring your A game in terms of haggling though. If you plan to shop for hours (best to start from 8pm onwards), be reminded that the subway closes at 12am so the taxi will have to be your alternative back to the hotel/hostel. "
