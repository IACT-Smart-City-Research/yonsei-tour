Mega shopping centre,"Hugh shopping centre catered for the family. There are sports,kids section. Lots of fashion shops, sports shop, restaurant abd even a kaokao shop!"
Fun for the Whole Family,"Starfield Goyang is a destination mall situated on the northwest edge of Seoul. About 1.5 hours from Pyeongtaek with normal traffic, the mall has something for everyone. For the adults, plenty of shopping, great restaurants (Shake Shack and Starbucks Reserve just to name a few). For the kids, there are age appropriate choices for all. There is a Sports Monster for the older kids (good for adults too), a Challenge 1250 Indoor Playground for the elementary age set, and a Toy Kingdom play area for the little ones. There is also a Megabox if you wanted to make a day of the place - which is very easy to do. Parking is free and there is public transit nearby. In all - something for everyone."
Address shown is incorrect ,From subway you can take a taxi or alternates route because options using naver to get to pinpoint on TripAdvisor took us to a temple far away from mall costing me $$ to find help to call a taxi for my daughters and I . Not that taxis starting date before you board is 3000-3800 plus time and distance !
Shopping center ,Place nice for shopping also good for children most of the famous brands there in weekend very crowded and busy they also have halal restaurant for muslim also there is cinema and there is parking and no fees for barking And very safe of course and the toilet very clean 
GREAT PLACE TO SHOP BUT...!,"Rating it four stars because of the ‘pets allowed’ policy. If you’re not a pet person/dislike the smell of any pets during rainy days, this is not a place for you. BUT I gotta say, they do have everything you want. Great place to shop! Market too has variety of choices."
"THIS PLACE HAS EVERYTHING. FULL OF WELL KNOWN, AND DELICIOUS EATERIES, WORTH A VISIT.","THIS PLACE HAS EVERYTHING. i MEAN EVERYTHING! Especially, ones for staying in korea for a short time should visit this place. We were there only for a few hours though we have had tried a variety of foods and satisfied."
Favorite mall in Korea,This mall has everything and more you'd expect from a Korean mall. Great selection of stores and restaurants and other forms of entertainment to boot.
Super Mega Mall,"We visited this recently open luxurious mall in early September 2017. It was 10 minutes walking from Samsong subway station. The mall was super big, mega mall, not only shopping facilities, but a sports center, rooftop pools and a children’s play park.You may visit several times to complete."
