Probably my favourite thing to do near seoul,"Sure it's a bit far (40 mins train, 40 mins bus) from most main tourist zones in Seoul, but this quirky little park is worth your time. Part cave, part weird underground amusement park, this place can keep you busy for an hour or two for sure. I see people talking about the walking/steps, but if you are even minorly in shape, it's not an issue (maybe a few hundred stairs total). We did a cold wednesday morning and it was almost completely empty. For only 6000won, plus another 3000 to go through a ""horror cave"", you really can't go wrong. In addition to the cave and it's few offshoots, you can also do some virtual reality (5000-14000won), climb a platform for pretty good views, and there is upcycle art gallery worth a quick wander. It's not that the cave or attractions were so good, it's just the undeniable uniqueness of the entire experience that isn't available anywhere else on planet earth."
Good cave park for a day trip from Seoul,"This is a cave park with some fun attractions, shops and foods. Very nice for a family with young children. A day trip from Seoul is available.- How to get there: Subway line #1 (heading to Suwon, Byeongjeom, Shinchang) from Yongsan to Geumcheon-gu Office. And there's a connecting 4-coach shuttle train from the very platform you got off. This shuttle train stops at the next stop, 'KTX Gwangmyeong'. Be aware of this train's schedule. In the worst case, you may wait for almost an hour. After leaving Gwangmyeong Station through exit #7 or #8, take bus #17 at platform #8-1. 10~15 min until Gwangmyeong Cave. Follow others after that. It's about 15~20 min until the ticket office.- Entrance is 6,000 won for adults and there are other discount rules.- It takes about an hour to see the cave. You will go until wine cellar & café and come back.- Gwangmyeong Cave isn't that tough to walk around. Seniors can finish even if there are some up & down. They provide helmets. But, these aren't necessary. The observatory is next to the cave entrance and this is the only thing turning down for seniors.- There are other attractions in and out. Additional programs for additional costs. These are mostly good for children.- You can learn the cave's history. But, this cave is mostly for entertainment having fishes, laser show, illuminations, photo spots, wine cellar, etc.- The food truck zone outside looked cool for foreign visitors."
Great place to spend some time ,"We had a really good visit! The cave itself was a very enjoyable showing, but I also enjoyed learning the history of the cave. We visited the second exhibit (better for kids, additional fee) “Rainbow Factory”, a hands on traveling exhibit and light and technology. We didn’t experience the VR (additional fee) but heard great things. We hiked up past the sign on the mountain and explored the upcycled Zoo exhibit as well. Food trucks and cafes on site. Water for kids to splash in. "
Be ready to walk ,"It’s my first time visiting this attraction. Visit was worth it. The light and sound show. The gallery. The Lord of the Rings concept . The dark history of its past. But just a gentle reminder, this is said to be more of a man made instead of a natural creation. Another reminder , going to the main entrance itself will be a steep uphill climb. And inside will require 150 steps each going up and down both ways. A small consolation is a drinking fountain midway. And of course some wine tasting at the end of the tour . Our tour organiser arranged a fine dining set up for us. "
Cave theme park during winter,"You can tour inside the cave for 1hr...lots of stairs and cool inside, you won't get lost, there's a lot of guide too. Outside the theme park are food and gift shops, and down further you'll see a mini recycling park and museum."
A bit far but it's worth the trip,"I traveled all the way from Yongin to see this beauty. Took the subway all the way to Cheolsan Station from Stadium-Songdam College Station (took me 1 hr and 40 mins). From Cheolsan station Exit 2, I walked a little to the left and crossed the street towards the bus stop and rode Bus 17 which goes all the way to the entrance of the cave (travel time is around 1 hour). Upon arriving at the main entrance, I had to walk upwards for around 8 minutes just to get to the cave entrance itself. Tickets cost 6000 KRW for adults. Upon going in, you'll be amazed how Koreans were able to transform a former mining cave to the attraction that it is now. Inside they have aquariums, light tunnels, a lake, dioramas, and even a wine laboratory!Be ready to go up the Stairs of Longevity. It's quite steep and I was out of my breath upon reaching the top!Kids and elderly people might have difficulty roaming here as there are a lot of stairs, but they have designated rest areas where people can sit.A must-see! When I was there, all the people inside were Koreans."
Interesting ,"Booked the EG shuttle to visit the Cave which is an hour from Hongdae. Must be physically fit to visit because it took us about 1.5 hours to complete the circuit, excluding the horror zone. It is cool in the Cave with impressive light displays. Initially, the route we took was mostly down the steps but there was a stair of longevity which was going upstairs and it was challenging. There were no worries about getting lost because staff at stationed at strategic points to direct visitors. The last point is the wine cellar and there was even sampling of wine. After this section, we u turned and. the exit was not far away. Didn't want to wait for the EG shuttle so went across the road to take Bus 17 to go to. Cheolsan Station to return to Seoul. "
"A historical, fun, entertaining, and interesting attraction","There's so much to see in the Gwangmyeong Cave alone. They have a light and sounds show in the media cave, big & moving dragon sculpture, hall of lights, aquariums, wine cave and cellar, horror section, historical and information area, golden cave, etc. Just be prepared to walk up and down lots of steps and stairs."
"Transit tour early morning fron incheon, too good to explore by yourself","Modernized cave with entertainment , various activities, sightseeing with aquaruim (small), light and sound displaying on the rock facade, winding steps but not too physical demanding, ex underground lake with light illuminstions, temperature is cool as compred with freezy cold outside. Pink tall chimney is the landmark when reaching this cave themed park.I booked transit tour ahead from incheon sirport website, important thing is that you need early morning arrival and then quick go thruogh immigration, further your way out through the custom declaration and go to identify yourself-booking reply e mail at the tour desk between exit gate 8_9. It's amazingly organized , and much important thst it's all free including transportation, english speaking tourguide, admission fee and transfer back to your terminal. "
A MUST-SEE ,"We definitely recommend a visit to this site: a testament to the will of the Korean people to overcome a dark past. This cave was actually a mine exploited by the Japanese during their occupation where Koreans were the forced labour to mine gold, silver, zinc and other minerals. It was later used to store dried shrimp and other foodstuffs, then left abandoned for forty years. The old mine has been converted to a tourist site as a cave with an interesting light and media displays, local plants nurseries, and aquariums of exotic fish - all in addition to relating the story of the cave's past. For me a hightlight was a New Age music and video presentation using the contours of the rock as a screen for the video - just spectacular!"
Worth visiting!,Visited this place as part of a transit tour. This place used to be a mine before it was turned into a tourist attraction. It is rich in history and culture and offers more than expected.
visited here two times!,"i ve never seen a cave so colorful. You can not imagine it until you actually see it. My family liked here and i took my friends with me. They all were amazed by the cave. 가족과 한번, 그리고 친구들과 한번 갔습니다. 무더운 여름에 갔기때문에 시원한 동굴이 천국 같았습니다. 아이들과 함께 오는 가족이 많았습니다. 일제강점기때 탄광하던 곳으로 이런 역사를 배울 수 있는 기회도 더 많이 생기면 좋겠습니다."
Cold on summertime,"It was refreshing as it was breezy inside the cave. It's a 1.5 to 2hr drive from the city. We went there through EG bus, purchased a roundtrip ticket. You will love esp. If you can take your time and drink some wine."
Former mine turned tourist spot ,"This was 2nd stop of our famtour. This is a good spot for picnic and relaxing. There were many students present here for maybe an educational tour. There are shops and even a restaurant inside the cave. Formerly the caves consisted of 8 layers but due to flooding, only 3 upper layers exists today. "
Sightseeing with friends ,We enjoyed the cave and was amazed with the way this place was fixed and opened to tourists. I also liked the wine cellar. I enjoyed the visit. 
Cave Attraction,"I like this place with beautiful lights with an aquarium in it. Inside there also have zombie cave, superhero cave. It is hard for an elderly or young child to ascend up the longevity ladder as it has very steep steps. Outside the cave, there are quite a few photo stops for scenery."
Theme Park kinda cave,Drop by if you have extra time in the area. It is not overly exciting but good to pass an hour or two exploring the caves. Easy to navigate.
Good if you are in Gwangmyeong region,"The cave was very developed for tourism, and its ‘gold’ theme. But as compared to the many caves in korea, this cave is definitely very dull. Unless you are a die heart korean drama fan who wants to visit this filming site, it is definitely not worth the long, expensive and inconvenient trip from Seoul. "
Cave Theme Park in Korea,It's 1st Cave Theme Park in Korea which develop and renovate an old Gold Mine to be the attraction. The weather inside is around 12C all year round. You can enjoy many spots inside. There are some shows & performance in the main hall every Sat-Sun. Do not forget to taste some nice wine from Wine Restaurant.
Interesting and mine converted to attraction. ,"It takes 1 and 1/2 hr to reach the cave from Seoul . Exit 2 of Cheolsan Station of line 7 >bus station across 2001 outlet(towards Huan-Dong, Soha-Dong) same side as Daiso>bus 17 last stop at Gwangmyeong Cave. Alternative walk slip up hill to the cave or walk steps which is nearer. Inside the caves there are lot of walking and steps too. It is worth visiting. "
A nice visit if you have a free afternoon,"From there Seoul Station, it takes about an hour on the train plus bus and then a long walk to the cave entrance. I didn't see any foreign tourists here. It took about an hour to walk around the cave (which is an old mine). I didnt realize how many stairs it would involve since you go down underground many levels. It is pretty cool but humid in there. It took about an hour to walk through. They decorated the inside with lights and effects which I enjoyed."
Amazing cave,"A lot things you may find and experience inside the cave ,,You must come and see!An aquatic aquarium?Underground areas in cave?Theater?Gold way?Wine area?All are big check!"
Cave attraction in Gwangmyeong,Its a large cave/mine that has been transformed into a tourist attraction. They have sunk quite a bit of time and money into making it appealing for all ages. We went in the morning to beat the weekend crowds. Definitely worth a visit
Good but still needs improvement,"The caves located around 1 hr 30 mins deive from Seoul. Myeongdong cave is beautiful, there is a restaurant with perfect wine, collections of fish and plants, very good conditions. The problem is how about for older people ? As it will be hard to walk far from parking site to the cave, also inside the cave. And when we returned back at night, there are no lights on the way from cave to parking lot. Grade 7,5 out of 10"
My 7 month old and husband loved the cave,"The cave has an awesome art display and amphitheater. My son loved the fish and water fountains in the cave. It is a little cool in the cave, bring a jacket. The biggest thing is no one knows how to get here. We had to take a cab, and the cab driver had never heard of it. With how big the area is and the activities in the center I was surprised no one had heard of this place. There is also an up-cycle museum and an art exhibit on the property."
Excellent theme cave park,"C1 ( 2017.01.18 ) I think there was good to visit in weekday rather than weekend because I heard there was very crowded in weekend or holiday. This cave was not very big, but had enough space to enjoy. There divided small part, botanic garden, aquarium, wine storeroom, theme park, etc. This cave was remodeled mine under the Japanese colonial period, so had sad history. But there was opened 2 years ago for theme park. I enjoyed this cave with good feelings, and the staff was very kind. And there can buy wind made in Korea."
Crowded on a holiday,"Went there on Christmas eve and turned out to be a mistake as there are too many people visiting. The cave has lots of historical facts on the construction. But find it a little strange to see an aquarium inside the cave. Be warned....there are many steps and stairs to climb up and down, so if you have weak knees, think twice before visiting. "
Kwang Myung Cave,"Great Place to see and visit! Do not miss this historical site ! History , romance and a modern theme Park all in one!"
"A mine in the past, Now a cave with many attractions","The cave was once a mine for gold, silver, copper and few other minerals. It had 9 layers deep and had since 1972 stop the mine activity. The mine was then use to fermented salted shrimp which is the main ingredient to make Kimchi.Gwangmyeong Cave require you to take a stair case or you may wait for buggy service. However, the stair case inside the cave is also quite a challenge. The cave had Botanic garden, Aquarium, amphitheater, and also house few things like ghost house, the Lord of the Ring / Hobbit and many other in the making.Towards the end you can visit the wine cellar and they give you a sample of those wine kept in the cave. The is a Sky View deck outside the cave which enable you to have the view of Gyeonggi area / seoul. "
Unique experience,"Gwangmyeong Cave is basically a cavern theme park, offering cultural performances, unique activities and some more, including an aquarium, 3D hologram and laser shows, a waterfall, a giant golden statue, a small history museum, a tour in the cave underground, a horror house and yes, a wine cellar! Visitors can experience gold and rock mining too. Me and my husband had a good time here this summer, though people should be prepared for the great crowd and hours of waiting in the car, if they visit in a busy season :) The line can get too long and it's difficult to bear it in the Korean summer. Also, a warm coat inside the cave is a must! The area is beautiful and there's also a restaurant nearby in the same building with an art gallery and a charming souvenir shop. Right next to the cave there's a small convenient store too, making sure, that you won't pass out by the time you get to the ticket box. The parking area is quite big, though as I already mentioned, we still had to wait around 2 hours before we could even park. If you keep these things in mind and go there prepared, I'm sure you'll be able to fully enjoy whatever great things this place offers."
