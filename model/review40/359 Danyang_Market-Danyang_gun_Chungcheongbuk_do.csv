"Garlic, and some great local food","As soon as we arrived in Danyang we headed for the market that was near our GH. We found a little restaurant that sold a couple of tasty treats that we really liked. One was a kimchee pancake and the other was a kimchee rice in a pancake roll (not exactly sure if i described them properly but no idea of the correct name). They were delicious so we wandered round to a few more stalls where we sampled a huge fishball, ice cream and some other treats. The market consisted of 3 covered streets, each about 200m long, and had many stalls selling fish, meat products, noodles etc, but one street was devoted to garlic as this is the region where it is grown. We returned here on several occasions to sample treats from the foodstalls."
The most famous traditional market in Danyang,This traditional market is located in Danyang-eup(district of Danyang-gun) and very famous for foodies.There are some fine eats with garlics which are the best products of Danyang-gun. That's the main reason tourists wish to visit. And local people come to buy some farmer's products as well.The marketplace is not that big. 15~30 min walk from corner to corner.
