Whats not to like about a bridge that raises up,All men remain boys at heart and it was really cool to watch a bridge that lifts up to let the boats past. There is a free tour guide nearby who provides an interesting talk about the history of the bridge.
Yeongdo Bridge,"Stayed in Nampo Area, walking distance. We waited for the bridge to be lifted at 2PM. Though there are no ships. Its still a nice attraction, a lot of tourist and locals."
Visit if you are near,This bridge opens up each day at 14.00 and many tourists watch it. A nice touch is the road which has birds printed on it.
"Go at 14:00, that's when it goes up","Symbolic of people separated during the war. It's raised once a day. If you really want to see it, go at 14:00. If you know someone with a war connection, go with them, hear their story, and contemplate the past. If you don't, you're going to have a hard time understanding why you're in a crowd of people watching a drawbridge raise."
Yeongdodaegyo Bridge,We went on a rainy day and expected it to be empty but it was soooooo crowded with tourists and even locals!!Yeongdodaegyo bridge is one with a sad history so you can search it up to give you more reasons to drop by this attraction.It opens up once daily for bigger ships and yachts to pass by. Watch my video on my Instagram @xuantravelogue
Drawbridge!,We walked to this bridge from our hotel. Interesting drawbridge that allows ships to go past at certain times of the day. I walked on the bridge and took in the views! 
Bridge with sad story,"This bridge near Nampo dong, For me quite gloomy without I know the real story behind this. Many tourist come here when the bridge is up. "
You can see the gears that move the bridge,"You can easily get to Yeongdodaegyo Bridge by getting off at Nampo station and exit near Lotte Mall Gwangbok. The bridge itself is interesting, and you can see the gears that move the bridge. At night, the views on the bridge is beautiful.You can time a visit to Yeongdodaegyo Bridge when you visit BIFF, Jagalchi Market or wandering around the Nampo area. "
Just a bridge albeit with a bit of history,Nothing spectacular. Maybe just for a photo shot that I am here. Nice place to rest under the bridge facing the sea/river.
The only bascule bridge still in operation,"This is the only bascule bridge in Korea which is still lifting today.But, it's only symbolic procedure and ships don't pass during it's open.- Once a day at 2 pm.- The rooftop garden of Lotte Department Store Gwangbok Branch is a good place to look down. The route to reach is a bit confusing in the mall by the way."
Not too good a view of diamond bridge,Good place to have a beer and fast food. Claims to have a good view of the diamond bridge but the view from other beaches are better.
MOBILE BRIDGE,"Subway nampo, exit 6 (Same area of Jagaichi fish market, walking distance). It next to Lotte Mart, Gwangbok. It operate 2pm - 2.15pm the bridge will close and lift up to release the bigger ship pass by. At the same time, you can snap some nice photo. "
A bascule bridge,This bridge is different from other suspension bridges as it can be raised to allow ships to pass through. It is basically a bascule bridge. We came here using metro line 1 and stopped at Nampo station (exit 8). The bridge is very near the station. There is a Lotte dept store nearby.
historical bridge,"Yeongdodaegyo Bridge (oh wow, that was a handful to type) connects Busan’s mainland to the Yeongdo district on Yeongdo Island. It’s the first bridge that connected the island to the mainland. In its proximity to the ports, the bridge would lift to allow large ships to pass under it and people would gather here just to watch. Strange but true. The Yeongdodaegyo do have a sad history it it. During the Korean War, many Koreans flea to Busan. As the mass migration occur, Busan became a refugee city for Koreans. They will wait at this bridge, looking out to the mainland to see if their families and friends were fortunate enough to escape. I hate to think about war, and the effects it would have on me if I was ever caught in the middle of one. But I do know this, I would do exactly what the Koreans would have done, wait on this bridge in the hopes of seeing family and friends again."
Nice views at night,"One could access the bridge by taking Exit 6 of Nampo metro station. It is only a 5 minutes walk. From the bridge one could view the Busandaegyo Bridge, Jagalchi Market and the shoreline. The views are much better at night than at daytime. It is only a short bridge. At the bridge there are bus stops for taking busan tours and for going to Taejongdae (No. 8, 30, 66, 88)."
Its a draw bridge...,"Im not sure what the deal is here. Sure you don't see a draw bridge everyday. But the day I was there there were over a hundred people waiting for the bridge to open! It does everyday at 2pm. They play a song, there is a video, and the traffic guys yell at you to get off the bridge if you are too close when the ""event"" starts. It was actually pretty sweet. Some of the older tourists seemed to really enjoy it. I guess it bring some nostalgia for a simpler time. "
Good view at night,"Go at night and see beautiful path, you can walk and see cities from other view down the bridge. Near the nampo st, go to exit 5 or 8. And walk around 200mtr, their stair go to down. "
Multi purpose bridge-a historical bridge,The lifting of the bridge daily for ships to pass at 2pm local time was part of Busan's tourist attraction. You can either have a close look at the bridge from the river itself or from a distance at the observatory deck of Yongdusan Park (Busan Tower)
It's Just a bridge? but a historical one!,"Use as a bridge but all stop at 2 pm for 15 minutes, They will draw the bridge up - non functional but rather ceremonial. That is the best time to visit the bridge.Its a important landmark as local said that during war time this is the meeting point for reunion with your family member. (rather sad to hear that)"
