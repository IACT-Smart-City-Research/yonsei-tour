"Nice shopping, helpful staff","As a foreigner, I sometimes worry when shopping in Korea since my Korean is a bit rusty. I went into the Armani outlet and found what I wanted with no hassle. No one followed me around the store, no one hovered around, I could browse in peace until I made my decision. It was nice. The outlet overall is a nice place to shop. I love the Marvel Store and there are good restaurants for everything from date night to having a meal with friends and family."
A Nice New Outlet Location to Visit,Siheung Outlets is a new outlet location located outside of Seoul. It is still on the Seoul subway lines so it is easy to get to though it may take some time depending where you are located.The outlet is smaller than others in Seoul but has many different brands and there are a variety of items you can buy. Both Luxury and normal items. The food court is a little bit of the small size for how many people visit but the food is good and priced well. Make sure to go to the info desk first and see if there are any coupons available for stores as you might be able to save more. There is also a large play area outside for kids if you do bring kids. Pets are also welcome and there is a doggy stay area at Molly's Pet shop if you need to.Bring your passport as you may be eligible for tax free rebates.Overall I thought it was a good experience and it is not too far away compared to outlets in the USA and Canada.
