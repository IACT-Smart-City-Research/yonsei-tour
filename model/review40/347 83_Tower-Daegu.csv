Good view,"If you want to see the Daegu's view, climbing up this tower. The fee is ₩12000 ($10.50). The parking lot is near 83 tower. If you visit this tower in winter time, seeing beautiful decorated lights around the tower. "
Suitable for Observation and Dating.,"The 83 Tower is one of many towers in the world only for observation about townscape unlike subsidiary observatory on the top floor in very tall buildings. As long as I know there are such two towers in Korea. Those are Namsan Tower in Seoul and 83 Tower in Daegu. Although there is Yong Doo San Tower in Busan I'm not sure the height and scale are equal to those of them. Because the 83 Tower has cafe and restaurant it's suitable for dating, too."
A tower but slightly different,"To visit the tower you can take a bus (including the city tour bus) or the subway (but that involves a bit more walking). From the bus you cross the road and climb the steps to the small theme park. Information will tell you where to get the free shuttle bus that takes you to the towers base. The tower is very eighties, looks like 4 or 5 star hotel of the time. You can just pay your fee and do the tower, or explore three or four floors of associated attractions which include several restaurants, shops and an ice skating rink (complete with plastic polar bears). The top floor of the free attractions gives you an open place to walk round, take city photos and eat. There is also a old red London double decker bus (which looks genuine) and a classic car. I didn't do the tower but didn't mind the free attractions."
Typical tower experience with lots of food choices,This is a nice way to get an overview of the city. The most unique part of this site are all the restaurant and food options in the complex. 
Good place,top of the 83 Towers gives you a great view in daegu recommend !!! you can enjoy 360° view and enjoy the view of Daegu.
Daegu 101,"Daegu 83 Tower was definitely one of the highlights of my first trip to Daegu. As it has everything I like!Firstly, it has a super cool Trick Eye Museum! I've been to one in Seoul, but the one in Daegu is definitely more thrilling! Secondly, it has a beautiful observatory desk where you can see the whole of Daegu in your palms <3 How wonderful ~ Last, but not least, it has Ashley (aka buffet-style restaurant) And for me, food is everything <3 So my day was filled with lots of cool photos, beautiful view of Daegu and a very delicious food :)P. S: it also has some cool shops & cafes as well as cool installations! So I definitely recommend to check it out when you're in Daegu ;)"
Daegu's night view,It was hazy nor cloudy when we went so we were able to get a clear sight of daegu at a glance. There is a cafe up in the observatory as well as several souvenir shops! Worth a visit!
It's okay,Place close to city with interesting view. Not so many interesting things inside but nice artistic installation outside.
Great vista,"With minimal crowds, the view is lovely and worth a visit. The theming and lights at night make this as good in the evening as the day. A must when in town."
No worth the time and effort ,"We arrived at night and the way up was fast within 3min, we were up and the view was not spectacular just ok .. within 5 mins we decided to return to our car but waited 20mins for the lift. Do not visit"
ok,"Tower is a separate fee. there is nice view from top of mountain, but great view at bottom of tower so why pay extra? Definitely get some bubble tea before you go up though."
A quiet autumn night,"Was brought there by a couple of Korean friends to check out Tower 83. It was a chilly autumn night and there were beautiful lights on display that felt like Christmas came early! There were hardly any people around, maybe because it was close to closing time (we came after dinner). Parking was not an issue and we had the entire place to ourselves. We spent some time walking through the pretty light tunnels and admiring them before buying tickets up to the tower.Having been to multiple observatory towers in Tokyo, Shanghai, HK, Seoul, KL.. I would say that this was not as impressive but still nonetheless worth a visit. It’s not a complete 360 degree view and the topmost 83rd floor was still under renovations. We made it to 77th floor. The binoculars littering the highest floor worked and were free so I had fun ‘spying’ into homes and streets, just watching the world go by. There is also a sky drop where one can jump off the tower and abseil down. The famous Korean gameshiw Running Man filmed an episode there before and their aurographs are immortalized on the wall. Had a great time :)"
Very expensive and fancy place for dating and families.,"Very expensive and fancy place for dating and families. Actually it is part of the ELand, the biggest amusement park in Daegu. Here there are many restaurants and enjoyments for kis including ice link. They are not cheap at all. 10,000 won entrance fee for taking the elevator to the observatory at top. It is typical one as a tower. I advise you to rent a car to get there. On foot you are going to walk alot. Or you can use a shuttle bus for it."
Nice view ,Good place for a couple. You can get a good view on the top of the tower. I went to the theme park and went to 83 Towers. I paid a little bit more to go to the top of the tower but it was cheap. I got on Ice tea and sat at the bar to see the view in the night. Highly recommend !!!
Scenic,"The Tower is a bit dated and see better times. The lift to the tower was not fast as compared to other towers like Taipei 101. The views at the tower was good. At the 3rd level, there is a toy shop and outside the toy shop, there are lots of places to take good photos including one at the London Bus."
Beautiful Views,"Our family had a great time visiting the light displays at the bottom level, but the view from the top was gorgeous. Please use the rest room! Yes there is a great full window view there too! "
Beautifully decorated in evening but ticket to tower was pricey,We never took lift to go to top of tower because the ticket cost was very high.But in any case the first level was beautifully decorated with lights and things like london bus and chess pieces.We enjoyed the place overall.
Go just for the bathroom alone.,"Similar to other towers in the region. Nice views, but the bathroom is great up in the tower. You can go to the bathroom and see out to the view."
Very disappointing,"I was excited to visit the 83 Tower after having such a great experience at the N Seoul Tower. I had read reviews about how beautiful the view was at night. But sadly, I was disappointed. The viewing area was very small, yet had been mainly occupied by tables and chairs. There was no way of reaching the window to catch a glimpse of the view through the hoards of people and I couldn't help but feel claustrophobic. I will not recommend going unless your admittance is complimentary with your E-world ticket. If not, I would recommend that you rather admire the view of the beautifully lit-up orange Tower from the outside. "
Nice view of the city,"We got a complimentary ticket to go to the tower with our visit to E-world. The tower had good views of the city, but the windows were quite dirty so taking pictures wasn't possible. Prefer Seoul N tower to Daegu tower."
Good night scenes,I went there especially for night scenes. You can take funny photo at second floor without tickets.
Nice view over the city.,"There is a ice skating rink in the tower! The skates aren't special if you've done it before but it was fun after a while to do some ice skating after looking down from the peak! It is an easy walk away from the green (2?) metro line, all the way to the bottom of the tower. We wanted to do the rope jump but I don't think it was open at the time.The E-world is just below it. But if you're really looking for a view from up high over the city, maybe the mountains are a better way to do it. This is just easily accessible and some people may enjoy going up with an elevator more than hiking.There are all kind of love things up there also and a nice garden with coffee shops."
me my wife my son his wife,it was a cool place to visit a lot to see they have a nice food courts and attractions a fun park next to it I recommend not to eat at the Ashley's on the top floor if you are hungry and on a budget ordered the steak dinner no kidding it was a size of a fifty cent piece lol but over all I recommend you check it out
Beatiful Views,"My wife and I went to visit 83 Tower in the evening and it was amazing! The views are spectacular from above the city, the walking paths were inviting and it is a great place for the family and for date night. "
Very nice view over Daegu,Worthwhile to have a short stop. You can combine this with E-world and the cable tram. We did just the tower. There is a free shuttle bus from the entrance of E-world to the tower entrance.
Beautiful view! ,"Definitely a must see if you ever visit Daegu. Has a beautiful scenery overlooking the city, positive atmosphere and Ashley's restaurant on the first floor was awesome! Especially if you like the idea of unlimited wine for a small fee. Family friendly and overall a good time! "
Its beautiful in cherry blossom,Good plac3 to visit at cherry blossom time...love the view... most tavorite place when i visit daegu....
Superb Dining in a Rotating Restaurant,"The 83 Grill By Ashley restaurant features contemporary Haute cuisine served with elegance and efficiency. The food was superb with each course described in detail. It looked great, tasted fantastic and was complimented by a good wine list. The scenery passing by is great by day but apparently fabulous by night. Prices were acceptable and less than in my hotel. Highly recommended as a must do in this city"
Nice to visit,I went at night with my boyfriend and it was worth it. There are lots of things to do even if you dont do the amusement park around it. Nice evening activity or date.
Daegu 83 tower woohoo,As I love to go up towers at different cities to get the best views the 83 tower made a perfect view. South Korea is pretty notorious for the night lights so the tower made it the best place to see the city at night and the day. I will always try and see the city during the day/ sunset and night in one go so it makes a nice change to see how different the city looks between the day night. But as you travelers know it's the best time is the time before during and after sunset so enjoy it. 
First visit,There's plenty to do but English speaker's are limited. The elevator ride in the tower is not free. The restaurant in the tower is VERY expensive. You can see the entire E world amusement park and Daegu. The view is prettier at night. There's also a museum.
Interesting Experiences inside and Awesome view from the top of the Daegu city,"This is not just one of the tallest towers in South Korea, there are also many interesting activities that you can enjoy with your friends and family inside the tower."
Good View,You can see Daegu city from the top and there is cafe with some table and chairs. Nice place for a quick visit.
Spectacular View from the top,"Didnt know that the 83 tower is actually taller than namsan tower. In spilt seconds, I will reach the observatory deck of the tower! Do visit the cafe there and enjoy the view at an affordable price(cheap i mean)."
Good View,"There were wonderful views of Daegu from the 83 tower at night. There are some table & chairs on the wall. So, you can sit on there and enjoy the peaceful view!"
Cusok2015,Romantic in the night with ur couple...I have something from daegu 83tower...i have no coupleThats it
the best way to view the Gu,"I've done this countless times and never get sick of the views from the chestboard, garden area. I actually prefer it to the tower itself! Rimini's is a great place to eat after you find your house or Gu but get there before 8pm because that's their last order."
Beautiful views,"If you decide to walk to 83 Tower, be prepared for some hills getting there. However, the views both at the bottom of the tower and the top are beautiful and worth the walk up. There is a Sky Jump (wasn't open when we went) that looked good for adrenaline junkies like me. Cute little cafe at the top, was nice to sit and enjoy the views for a few minutes."
More than a tower.,"In our visit to the 83 tour we had fun from the moment the taxi let us off. Let me mention now that getting a taxi back down is difficult if you aren't Korean and can call one; you basically have to wait for them to drop someone off. There are many things in the lower floors, restaurants, cooking classes, ice skating rink. stuffed animals for photo shots, if you have a sense of humor and are into taking photos there are many ops. We even bought the photoshopped picture of us in front of the tower with fireworks going. The sculptures on the outside floor were interesting as were the tree of locks the Korean couples had completed, this seems to be in many places and part of the rituals of dating/ love. It was fun to compare it to towers in other cities. We wanted to take the sort of cable car down the mountain but learned it was part of going to the amusement park below."
If the weather is good..,"To visit the 83 Tower in Daegu is a great idea - if the weather is good! If it's too cloudy you can't enjoy the amazing 360° view. Furthermore we also had fun ice skating on a very cold field and we visited the TrickEye museum too. It's perfect to spend time here with family or friends and if you bring your love one, there's a love tree with a looooot of love key locks ♡ very romantic! ... if you forgot to brig the lock, you can buy a cute one in the convenience store next door."
Christmas lights,"We went with my son and another couple and walked the grounds. Beautiful, went to SPA valley and I think the lights were just as good but maybe better. "
High. Amazing. Romantic,"This tower even taller than Namsan Tower in Seoul. Also, you will find this place is very interesting. Here, you can find sky garden and there is also shuttle bus that will bring you from the main gate (at the parking lot, take the street next to E World ticketing booth) to the main entrance of 83 Tower since 83 tower is located on the valley and the way to get there is uphill so it will be really tiring and take a lot of time if we want to get there by foot. The ticket entrance itself costs 10,000 KRW, including the photo ticket, where you can get your photo printed with 83 tower as the background. After get the entrance ticket, you can go upstairs using elevator to the 77th floor where you can see Daegu view from above. Because 83 tower is a new attraction, you will not be able to see a bunch of facilities as at Namsan. Upstairs, you can only found one coffee shop and the photo booth. Quite boring but if you go there with your partner, you can simply buy a cup of coffee and enjoy the view of Daegu."
