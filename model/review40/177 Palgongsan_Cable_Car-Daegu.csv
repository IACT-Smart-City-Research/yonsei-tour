Good view ,"Palgong mountain is the most famous mountain in Daegu, kyeongbuk province. The cable car charged â‚© 9000 ($8) per person. You enjoy watching the panorama during climbing up and down. "
Palgongsan Cable Car,"Good atmosphere, easy to travel, there are cars passing by, there are Korean restaurants. Can go forever"
Visit to Grandsons Birth City,Daegu is a beautiful city with many fine restaurants and places of interest to see. Our trip on the Cable Car to the top gave us an unbelievable view of the city and surrounding area. In expensive and a must visit.
Hiking in Palgongsan National park,Very nice scenery. It is handy to go ip to Palgongsan mountain by cable car and from there higher up to the top. You can walk all the way over the ridge of the mountains (very long hike). You can also come down and pass by Bongwasa temple.
Hiking,"View was amazing! Price was reasonable. Quite far off to go though. At the top, had a restaurant, a tad pricey. Able to hike more if you wish. Flying noodle is a big thing here but i dont understand the hype, i tried it. So troublesome to eat. Many other tourists here as well."
Nice views and better value than Aspan Park.,This was better value than Aspan Park cable car.Longer ride with possible single cabin.Good views and walks at the top.Still not well marked for English.
"11,000won per round trip",Second time here .. it was drizzling the whole day but I gave it a shot anyway. Cant see much on the way up. Advice is do not go when it rained/ is raining. Nonetheless the view was amazing when the skies are clear last year
Lovely little ride,"This place is easy to get to via red bus #1, go to the end of the line and then walk up the hill. It's not long or fancy but very pretty in the autumn colours or in the winter snow. There are plenty of cafes and eateries near by and the famous natural spring jimjibang/ spa."
Worth it ,"Great view! A bit of slope from the bus stop to the cable car area. Do wear comfortable shoes. There is a cafeteria on top where you can enjoy traditional Korean food and wine. Coffee, tea, snacks and ice cream available too. "
Visit to peak point,Simply excellent .Spectacular views.Good restaurants up.View of Golf Course.Very Good French origin cable cars .Very safe.Bring good cameras
nice September day at the top,We went up early (9am) so we were among the first to go up at 930am. No traffic. We had breakfast at the top and viewed the city below.
