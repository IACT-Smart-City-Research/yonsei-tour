Historic medicine ,The museum organized & informed very well for someone who doesn't know about herb medicine. It's the most famous herb medicine town that is located near museum since almost 500 years ago. 
Engaging and innovative displays,"Was very impressed at the cleanliness and user-friendly set-up of this museum. After passing through an elaborate ancient archway, there are gigantic installations of the brewing pot used for medicines and a fun presentation of medical materials with cartoon figures. This summed up the contemporary approach adopted for the whole museum, reaching out to youngsters, students and non-Korean speakers with main titles in English and sub-titled videos though many details were not translated. However there were enough visuals to educate and amuse visitors on the history of traditional medicine in Daegu and its applications even in the modern day.Life-size figures of traditional doctors and nurses and how they take the pulse, examine the tongue and use acupuncture and herbs give a very clear idea of medicine in its origins. The fundamentals are close to Chinese practices but Korean medicine prizes ginseng much more and the role of the Joseon kings and their court was more important.The museum is free and there is a toilet on every floor, packets of herb-based candies and drinks can be purchased and there's a room for footbaths for a fee. Even saw a room with costumes for hire for photo-taking. "
Good learning experience,"The museum is free to enter but the down side is that the descriptions are in Korean. However, at the ground floor there are interactive panels with english descriptions to help you learn more about traditional medicine. They also have free foot bath outside the vicinity but we didnt dare to try as we are unsure of the hygiene standards. The foot bath area looks a bit dirty and not sure how often is is cleaned. We paid 5k KRW per pax for a nice herbal foot soak at the ground floor of the museum for about 40 minutes. A great way to relax your feet after a long day of walking. Would recommend going to this museum!"
Interesting,Interesting place to learn the devemopment of Chinese medicine in Korea. The paid foot spa is also worth trying. 
Worth a short visit,"This free museum is better than average but not up to very good. Between the two I opted for very good.The written descriptions are all in Korean, except the titles are also in English. There are many interactive displays in Korean, English and Chinese so we still got to understand some and found it a bit of fun. There are many models and visual displays to look at too.We entered one hour before closing but we could easily spend another 15 to 20 mins.We missed out the herbal foot spa because this service is only available until 5pm."
Interesting ,This museum is free to enter. It is rather interesting but hard to understand anything When most of the information was in Korean. 
Free Entrance!!! Lots of thing you can see... about the Traditional Korean Medicine. So why not visiting!!!!,"Free Entrance!!! Lots of thing you can see... about the Traditional Korean Medicine. So why not visiting!!!!There are only two museums for Korean medicine in Korea. One is in Seoul and the other is in Daegu. If you missed the museum in Seoul, you can try this one instead. Inside there are many things you can see.. and learn. But unfortunately, no english description on each panel. There is free Korean medicine tea to drink and 5,000 won foot bath with Korean medicine. It's worth trying."
An opportunity to learn about Korean Sasang Constitutional Medicine,"I must admit there was not much in English, when we entered this nice little museum, but there are many visual arrangements, hands-on activities, and movies that give you a notion of what traditional Korean medicine is about. First of all, one should be aware that it is not a mere reproduction of Traditional Chinese medicine. While having its roots in China the theoretical foundations of present-day Traditional Korean Medicine (TKM) were laid out at the end of the 19th century. During those decades China lost control over the Korean Kingdom while Japan's influence was steadily growing, eventually leading to the annexation of the country. It was during this short period of awakening and a certain independence, when a physician called Yi Je-ma published a book ""Longevity and Life Preservation in Eastern Medicine"" (1894), proposing what he called the Sasang typology. It divides people in four types based on their bio-psychosocial traits: Tae-Yang (Greater Yang), So-Yang (Lesser Yang), Tae-Eum (Greater Yin) and So-Eum (Lesser Yin). Depending on one's constitutional type the actual manifestations of a certain disease will differ from patient to patient. Respectively treatment methods have to take that into account, so they will differ for one and the same disease as well. Sasang medicine is a quite unique and interesting approach. Nowadays there are papers in English and even a book on Sasang medicine. Another important topic of this museum is the history of the old medicine market (Yangnyeongsi) in Daegu which once was situated near the old city walls. After the annexation of Korea by the Japanese in 1910 the walls were torn down and the market was about to be closed for ever. After heavy protests and rising unrest among the population the Japanese authorities decided to relocate the market to its present place. The museum has a nice gift shop and if you are lucky, one of the English speaking young ladies will give you a tour. If you are free to choose a convenient date for your journey to Daegu, I would recommend the beginning of May when they have the ""Yangnyeongsi Herb Medicine Culture Festival"" with many attractions all over the market quarter."
Worth the trip,This museum is small and doesn't take a lot of time ... about an hour. We learned a lot as this was not a subject that we were familiar with. The area is interesting to walk through as well.
Unique and informative,"I thought this was better than I had projected - I learned a lot. Yes, there is not as much English as I needed, but it was very visual. There are hands-on activities and an opportunity for a Korean foot bath which was blissful."
Interesting but not much English,"The place is interesting, laid out over 3 floors. It is child friendly. There are a lot of digital interactions and films, most of these have a button for choosing English. Unfortunately the static displays and writing on cards is all in Korean, and it was a shame these were not to be understood. Still interesting, though. Free entrance. You need about 45 minutes to go through the place."
Unique and interesting museum,"Interesting museum, with plenty of information (not all in English) about Korean oriental medicine. It is a great place to spend a couple of hours. And it is free"
Unique free museum - interactive layout,Off the beaten path museum but easy to find near to main road and metro station. The surrounds has lovely cobblestone streets and artworks lining the walls. Below is a herbal market filled with fragrances. The museum is spread over two floors outlining the history and breadth of orientalist herbal medicine. Interactive displays in English with hands on activities at the end. Small shopfront with few items to buy. Nice outdoor herb garden terrace as well. 
Interesting museum accessible to English-speakers,"The museum was more interesting than I expected. It tells the story of the oriental medicine market and its impact on life and health in South Korea. Museum is free as is an audio guide in English. You can move at your own pace and decide which tracks to listen to. There were some hands-on elements as well. At the end, there are options for herbal foot soak and massage, tea, and other programs. Staff were very friendly."
Worth going to especially if you have an interest in the history of localities or traditional healing spaces,"A free museum, well marked and deserving of more than an amble in an area full of medicinal value. I do mean the average shop in the area will test your Ginseng/root/shoot/plant/quotient. Most of the shops mark price in a language most foreigners can understand but product details are often marked in Korean only. Best to see this museum and catch the weekly market to get a sense of the place."
A nice place to learn the history and the culture of the past about Oriental medicine,"In the museum, you can learn and see many things which have been used as the oriental medicine from the pas till now. And also, you can experience it yourself!"
An okay exhibition on Oriental medicine,The exhibits are okay but nothing really noteworthy or spectacular. The latin names for Korean plants and herbs aren't very helpful either. The location is especially poor if you're driving. The three way becomes a bottleneck at lunch time. 
A good place to explore about Korean traditional medicine.,I have visited this museum and it was really interesting than I expected. There are many sections separated in each category for the oriental medicine and how they use those in real life. I gained a lot of knowledge from there as well as enjoy a lot on the experiences inside the museum.
Free Fun!,If you are interested in the history of the Korean traditional medicine this is the place for you. It is centrally located and has some of the best bad taxidermy that I have seen in South Korea. I was almost in tears from laughter.
Very interesting and free,Went there with a tour group. The museum is very interesting and the people that work there were very pleasant. You should be able to get through the entire museum in about an hour or two. Be sure to check out the herbal medicine maket afterwards.
Some entertainment ,"I was missing more english information!But if u know Corean it will probably is a good place to learn about It!You can try on hanbok, traditional Corean dress!that was fun!Some small activities for the kids "
it's free!,"We were walking around the herbal medicine market area and checked out the museum for about 30 minutes since it was free. Some good display about the history of the area...but as weren't all that interested in medicine, we just walked past most exhibits...Displays can use more English captions...if you're in the area, might as well check it out...it was more interesting than the market area"
medicine tour,Was our second time there and had the Stuffed medicine Chicken. It was great and will do it again. I took a visitor from the US and her and her mom loved it.
Fascinating!,"I really enjoyed visiting this museum and wish that there had been more information in English. It was still very interesting. The museum was modern and well played out. The videos had English subtitles and the displays were titled in English and Korean, which I photographed to research some of the subjects later. There was an elevator at the entrance and the visit started on the 3rd floor. From the elevator exit, there was a video directly in front and to the right, around the corner was an information stand with brochures in English. On the side street that leads from the main street to the museum, there was a small coffee/tea shop owned by a young couple. I stopped there after visiting the museum. They didn't speak English and the menu was in Korean, so I let them choose a tea for me. The tea was very good and they were super friendly."
"Good museum for children, try the ginseng foot bath","As this is a free museum, I would recommend this place. Don't expect too much of it, since it is a bit small. The information is not always very informative if you expect something that is based on science, but there are some nice stories told. I think it would definitely be an exciting place for children. I would recommend trying the ginseng foot bath for an oriental medicine experience."
background information about oriental medicine,free entrance. this is a good place to get a first impression about oriental medicine. it is located in the middle of medicine street.
Much better than expected,"From other reviews on other websites, I really didn't expect much, but I was pleasantly surprised. Most of the signage is in Korean only, but almost all of the computerized kiosks had an English-language option. I'd say it's probably best though if you have some sort of interest in healthcare. We also enjoyed bathing our feet in the little stream that flows through the front garden - the water was ice-cold, but helped our throbbing feet."
Very interesting museum,We really enjoyed this museum. It is free to get in and has English information at all of the major displays. You get to learn about the history of oriental medicine in Daegu. There are many interactive displays. I highly recommend it.
Good Ginseng,Korean Ginseng is what people want to buy here . Rest you can love few other things but all made of Ginseng
sorry,i'm can not english.English translator interpreted as do not know of all the questions in English not answer I'm gonna. I'm sorry.
