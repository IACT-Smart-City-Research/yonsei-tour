Seoul Horse Racing,"Seoul Racecourse located in the South of the city is a wonderful attraction and a great way to spend a day in Seoul. The racecourse is located at Seoul Raccourse Station on the light blue line and is very easy to get to to from the centre of Seoul. It is also very cheap to enter only costing 2,000 Won which is like Â£1.40 making it probably one of the cheapest race courses in the world. There are plenty of places to eat and drink within the racecourse, although the only down side is that you can only buy a alcoholic beverage in the lounge area which coast 30,000 Won to enter. The Racecourse itself is massive with a capacity of 40,000 people it can accomodate and the sourroundings are beautiful with mountains in the background. The horse racing enthusiast you will find that there is plenty of help for placing bets and the whole system is automated with ticketing machines, the track is a dirt track for flat racing and the jockies are mostly Korean, with some USA and occasionally Australian. There is also plenty of racing for the day with 12-13 races every weekend, but I warn you it can be hard to pick a winner."
Good day at the races,"Good day at the races, we used the subway line 4 and got off at Seoul Race course park station, than walked with the crowd to the track, use your metro card to enter the track turnstiles then head for the centre of the grand stand and find the foreigner information desk, ask for directions to the Champions Suite on level 5, it will cost about W10000 it is only for foreigners, so bring your passport and it has a English speaking betting lady and bar people. Great room in front of the big screen, they sell cheap cans of beer and have free tea and coffee."
Good even without betting,"Mainly used as a horse racing. But, there are many family visitors.As well as they come, eat and rest, they watch horses, ride horses and do some other things.Summer night racing weeks are the best season with many events."
So Much Fun,"As a horse racing enthusiast it was great to experience it in a different culture. Easy to get to via the subway I really enjoyed my Sunday afternoon at the races, there were 12 races on the day I was there, though I could not stay for them all, and the local Korean crowd certainly raise the volume when the horses are coming up the home straight. A great way to experience some modern local culture"
And...................they're off!,"We took the kids (9, 3) to the horse track and enjoyed a wonderful afternoon. Subway takes you about a 5 minute walk from the entrance, painless. It's a very nice place to watch the horses run. We started off the day sitting in the grandstands watching a few races, then moved to the ""infield"" because all of the families seemed to be there. Moving to the infield was a mistake, the place was packed and the kids roam free with little to no parental supervision. You can rent bikes, there is a playground, there are several horses on display, but the chaos is just a bit too much. Moved back to the grandstand and enjoyed the rest of the afternoon. There are several places to grab something to eat, but if we go again we will pack a lunch and sneak it in, in a bag. Inside the bathrooms were very clean, there are 7-11s and a CU store, as well as several snack areas. Here is a tip...stay away from the heavy smoking crowd who are there to try to win their rent. Just find a nice area to watch the races, and make sure you bring the kids down to the ground level before every race to see the parade of horses. It was a nice day so we stayed in the open air. We enjoyed our day trip, and will definitely return. Total cost to enter was 2,000 won for the entire family. Snacks and drinks are the same price as if you went to a 7-11 on the street."
