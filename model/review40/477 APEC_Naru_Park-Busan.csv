A nice walk and beautiful views.,"We went here on a shore excursion before traveling to the Buddhist Sea Temple. We couldnâ€™t go in to the APEC House, but the walkway to the House and back is very scenic with lots of nice views. It is an easy walk."
Structures,Nice walk where you could enjoy some sculptures. Not much to see. Could easily do this in 1hrs. But a nice free activity. 
Beautiful park,Gardens and position on the coast make this a serene and beautiful place for time out from the city hustle and bustle. Very Pleasant Place.
Nice place,"I had I great walk from Park Hyatt about 10 minutes.Nice place to see,a beautiful park around ,all the way to Haeundae Beach."
LOVE HIKING?,"This is a great place for a hike, walk or a place to take a photo. The museum is a pretty cool attraction z to boot!!"
Oasis near the beach,"Visited here on a beautiful and warm fall weekday. The park is a beautiful place with wonderful views of the city skyline, the bridge, the beach, and the sea. Not many people here when I visited which gave it a calm feeling. I imagine it is quite busy on the weekend and in the high season. The APEC building is really cool too. Definitely a place to visit."
Beautiful Park.,Beautiful park by the beach. Need some stamina to walk up and around the park due to its lush ground . Place was clean and well kept. APEC house was historical. The lighthouse was great. Took many beautiful photos. 
Nice location,"Nice spot , nice surroundigs , with a historic background.Nice view but you miss nothing if you do not go to that place"
Hard to rate this site--too many factors to consider,"The park is really an attractive one, but not a great one. It is large and easy to walk (however, it can be too long for any in your group with mobility issues) in an hour or so. The key attraction is the APEC building--a well designed and interesting structure from the outside. The inside tour is OK, but not informative as one would like. It is a bit too ""touristy"" for us.The water and city views are beautiful. The architecture of the city is OUTSTANDING. It is hard to believe that they have as many great buildings as they have. The views form the park really show them off to grab your attention. There are lots of photo opportunities.To sum it up, we would not do this again, but it is a good trip to have a nice ""walk in the park"" along with some great views of the city--as well as the water. Once is enough!"
Ok place to visit,Building not of special interest unless you are history buff but nice walks around and views of beach. Not to go out of way for.
Only if you are a history buff,"The APEC building itself is really not that exciting or worth a special trip. If you aren't excited by history or politics, don't bother. There are a few decent views from outside the building and there is a nice walk over to Haeundae Beach, but that is pretty much the best part."
Lovely spot,"This is such a lovely park with great views and lovely trees. While here, you can also visit the building where the APEC meeting was held."
lovely little park with amazing sea views,"Worth a walk when near Haeundae beach , you will enjoy the pine trees and the beautiful sea views . Try also to walk in the close by park and check the pier nearby . Nice views of Marine city as well "
"Worth a stroll, both day and / or night","My family and I happen to stay quite close to the park so we managed to had a our day walk, and night walk, on separate days. Both present unique & interesting views of Busan shoreline. Go during the day if you'd like to visit the APEC memorial while you're there, coz it's closed at night."
APEC Memorial -,"An interesting visit to the venue of the 2005 APEC Leaders meeting.the park grounds are set up on a hill overlooking the ocean, very picturesque."
10 mins walk from our hotel,"I tried walking both early in the morning and at night but more people doing so at night. The usual way is going around since you can make a brief stop to enjoy the view of the ocean. You can also try getting the path at the center, it is worth a walk. At night you can got a good view of the Gwangandaeyo Bridge "
Very nice park,"A very nice park for taking those after dinner strolls, or bring your kids to run about. Romantic, serene and chill."
A Beautiful Coastal Walk,"Fabulous landscaped grounds greet the visitor to this site of the 2005 A.P.E.C. meeting. The viewing points are spectacular and the meeting house, come tourist attraction, is an interesting design."
lovely peaceful walk through the park,"We saw a different side to busy Busan. A lovely walk around the seaside park. Lots of cyclists, joggers and walkers enjoying the peace and sea air. An added extra was seeing the APEC conference hall and meeting room."
Beautiful scenery!,We will always come back! Itâ€™s a worthwhile destination so make sure to come here when you visit Busan! 
Relaxing visit,It is a very beautiful park with great scenery. The coastal road is very relaxing and you can take great photos here. 
Good Place,The most interesting part of the visit to the APEC naru park is the hall where the summit was conducted where in you can find the US president's chair next to the Vietnamese President's chair. The place has been retained and maintained well. The dishes served during the summit has been recreated in probably using plastic or biodegradable material...
A pleasant walk and view,"This is a nice place to get for a walk in Busan. There are two paths: one is more up and down with stairs, while the other is along a fairly gentle path further inland. There are some nice views of the city and sea from here."
Tiny park with a view of the bridge,"This is a small park below the APEC center. You don't want to go out of your way to see this park, but if you are walking or jogging around Dongbaekseom island, then jog/walk through the park so you can tick the box. Lots of don't walk on the grass signs....where there is only mud."
Nice park to walk around,We used metro line 2 and stopped at Dongbaek Station (exit 1). We had to walk about 15 mins to Dongbaek Island. The park is around Apec house and there is a track and boardwalk all the way to Haeundae beach. It was a nice and relaxing walk.
Nice place with great view on coastal line of the Busan,The place itself has a special meaning for many countries and was turned into a kind of monument/attraction. The park surrounding the place is nice as well as is the view on the city.
Educational Stroll in APEC House,"I know what you're thinking. I'm on vacation, why on earth should I embark on an educational stroll of anything? Hear me out. After your stroll around the decks overlooking the ocean, you will eventually come across the APEC House.The Nurimaru APEC House was the conference hall where leaders from around the world had their summit meeting back in 2005. At first glance, I wondered why the Koreans built such an oddball looking building (it looks like a funky spaceship in my eyes). But upon arrival and learning about it's history, the architecture of it was to represent the modernness of today with the roots of their traditional culture. It was built with representing the best of both worlds.Now, there's much more than what meets the eye from just glancing from the outside. You're more than welcome to come inside for free and browse this museum-like building. There are pictures and artwork and even a mini concept design of how this building was to be constructed. Not to forget that you can even take a walk inside the actual conference room where the summit took place.If you're wanting a little break from the outside and curious about a little bit of the modern history of Korea, feel free to browse inside this cool house. It's educational, it's family friendly and the kids can browse among themselves, it's the best spot on the whole island for a great view of everything, and it's free. So why not? Enjoy!"
Beautiful Scenery & Historical Significance,"This was one of the more enjoyable stops on our cruise bus tour of Busan. The area is on Camellia Islet and includes the APEC House from the famous 2005 meeting. Plan to do a lot of walking, some upgrade. The views, architecture and landscaping are simply amazing. You will not be able to stop taking hundreds of gorgeous pictures!"
Nice place to stroll around,"A stop on our tour, this is a pleasant place for a stroll around by the sea and enjoy the views. Good for an hour or so. "
""" nice day @ APEC Naru Park ""ðŸ˜Ž",""" artistic APEC Naru building with a beautiful view of the sea and clean park as well.. Good place to visit by anyone """
A great place to visit,This building is set in a lovely park and is worth the visit. There are many people out walking on the way there. The walk is up a bit of a hill.
Park with a sea view,You can jog around the area and there is a look out point for photographs. I personally like to walk around it during the summer breeze.
Amazing park and view,"The park has an extraordinary view of the ocean at its peak. Overall, when you walk through those green big trees, and the ocean nearside, there's an amazing smell in the air. You can go through it in 30 minutes, so I wouldn't miss it. Totally recommend :)"
Lovely place to walk,Our hotel was at the entrance of the park so it was a convenient place to walk around and enjoy the views. 
Great views,The park has great views and is a favorite for walkers and joggers. Nice way to spend a day if the weather is cooperative.
Good architecture.,"It looks like a spacecraft. Inside there, you can see real APEC meeting place and many Korean traditional ornaments, It closed at pm 5 o'clock. (I'm not sure). It's a good tourist place."
Bulletproof meeting room,"I do not think it is a good place to visit in winter. I am sure during summer time it will be wonderful place to chill. Nothing excited about Naru park except the bulletproff APEC conference room. Beside that, it is an average park that I would not come back for second time."
nice view in busan,it was very nice view in busan. you can walk around the place. i'm very enjoyed to take a picture and the weather was very nice.
Amazing view!,Had the chance to attend a startup demoday here and experience the gorgeous view. Definitely recommend when visiting Busan!
treading where world leaders had,"Great location, weather was stunning albeit very cold, so the views from the island were magnificent. Well worth a visit and right on the door step of Haeundae-gu beach."
Picturesque coastal park and APEC House,"APEC House, a seaside centre used for APEC in 2005 (?). It is a modern structure situated beside the sea and surrounded by a lovely park. Good for an evening stroll amongst lovely trees and bushes. Worth a visit for an hour or two."
a nice walk with great view,"This is great for newcomers especially to take in the ocean view and enjoy and scenic short walk. Nice option for a bike ride or jog, too. APEC Hall has little to offer, though. Closest subway station is Dongbaek."
Great views,From the APEC centre one could walk to Haeundae along the park. It is a scenic walk along the seaside and there is a bronze mermaid statue along the way. Beautiful views from the park.
Great view,"The view from this house is fabulous. You can see the sea, diamond bridge and haeundae beach. Cool place!"
A great morning hike,"Loves the place and views. The sea was not calm but the waves made a great melody. Even after a mini tsunami the day before, the sun managed to come out and it was such a nice day"
great place,"we went there twice. very relaxing. great view on harbor, beach. go to the top for better view. clean."
Mother Nature!,This is a long trail! You have to walk and walk and walk and walk surrounded by nature!Oh dear wear comfy shoes if you will visit here.
Visit,very much boring place. Not worthwhile to visit. The result of the APEC gathering Did not brought positive results. Visiting this place is not a must. Walking in the Dongbeak park surrounding the place is recommendable and clean environment. the views to the sea are impressive and unforgettable.
Lovely Scenery,"We walked from Haeundae beach up to here and it took about 25 minutes or more depends to if one is taking more time to enjoy the view along the way or taking photos and just sit down for some snacks before continue walking.It was winter season, quite cold for the first few days in Busan."
The little island in good for hiking,"APEC building is interesting so see, down near the water, is a small coffee sohp with decent coffee, just a few more chairs and tables wouldn't hurt. The island is nice for hiking."
Dongbaek Park/Nurimaru APEC House - Nourishing nature,"Take a delightful stroll from Haeundae Beach o Nurimaru APEC house Located on Dongbaekseom Island. The shoreline footpath feels like a road to recovery as one enjoys the tranquil landscape accented by pine trees, camelias and sounds of the birds. It was a soothing experience for me to soak up all that nourishing nature at my own pace. Attractions along the way include the Princess Hwagok mermaid statue, Korean style pavilion and Gwangan Bridge. The exquisite scenery harmonises perfectly throughout all 4 seasons, making this a great leisurely couples, family, young and old. Directions: Subway line 2 to Dongbaek station, exit 1. Walk straight towards direction of Westin Chosun Hotel on the left hand side. At Haeundae beach beside Westin Chosun, take the coastal boardwalk to Nurimaru APEC House."
Short and sweet,"The APEC Naru Park had lovely scenery, and beautiful ocean views - but the visit through the center took me about 30 minutes even with reading all the signage. Arrived via a boardwalk from the beach, and it was a nice rest spot after the walk. Learned a bit about the APEC Summit, but not enough.There's a beautiful mother of pearl mural in the entrance that took my breath away!"
Beautiful scenery,"This came highly recommended by my local guide, Frank. And it was worth every minute and seconds, dollar and cents. The view of Busan city and the seaside is amazing. You must make a stop here if you love nature and photography. Great place for friends gathering."
Walk and enjoy the scenery,Walk at the trail. And you will enjoy the view of busan ocean. Enjoy the coastline where you can get a fresh air of the sea breeze. 10 thumbs up for this location really recommended.
Loved the trail!,"Walked along the coastline, very nice scenery! Not really for the one looking some exercise but for leisure walk. "
Nice to walk around great views,The views from here are great and can be seen in several directions. It was quite a walk from where our tour guide dropped us off but this gave plenty of opportunities to take in the scenery. The light house is pretty neat.Inside the APEC building not a huge amount to see but was pretty neat to walk around and take in the history 
Again missed the time to open,"Went there 3rd time. I didn't manage my time proper and poor planning, didn't have chance to get in. But it is nice place walk around and have photo relax."
"Relaxing walk, interesting visit and wonderful views",The park is right on the waterfront and provides a relaxing area to walk and soak in the magnificent views across the ocean and down the shoreline. The summit building was also interesting to visit and learn of the recent history that surrounded the building. An enjoyable and relaxing experience that was definitely worth the visit.
Interesting park,"The APEC Naru Park is interesting to visit. Walking out on the pathway is a peaceful 500m walk to arrive at the complex. Once inside the complex, one can walk around the meeting rooms and the facility. It was cool to see this part of history."
A must go if around with time,"The park is not large but it is a good place to pay a short day-time visit for the fresh air, relaxing environment, good seaview overlooking the Qwangandaeyo Bridge far away. If you fidn the tower packed with photographers and their models, just walk back a bit and climb onto the stairs until you reach the pavillion on a gentle slope for even better views of the sea, the bridge and the tower. The circular building before you see the park is the venue for APEC 2005 Korea where you may have a good washroom break and a few photos with the pine trees around as background. "
A nice walk,"My hotel was near here so I sort of just stumbled across it. It is a nice place to go for a walk on a sunny day. I also managed to get some nice photos which is my favourite thing to do when travelling, so would recommend if nearby. "
Where Leaders Met,"Our visit in October to APEC, Busan, was part of a half day excursion from our Mariner of the Seas cruise. We approached Naru Park over the magnificent length of Gwangan Bridge that dominates the skyline in that part of the city. We walked up to the APEC building past flower boxes and shrubbery. The circular conference building sits on a headland with views back to the bridge and city beyond.A simple circular conference chamber where the participating nations are recorded. Outside you can stand where the leaders were photographed in 'costume'; stand as I did in John Howard's place and get your own snap by your better half!!A little bit of history."
A Park near Shinsegae,"This is a refreshing park, nice for a walk after shopping at the nearby Shinsegae.The river is clean and we saw some aquatic animal jumping in and out of the water.Think there is canoeing facility there as well."
Breezy work in the park,"A very nice place to visit. Great view of Gwangan Bridge which remind me of San Francisco Golden Gate Bridge. Also, nice view of buildings. Perfect ground to do your exercise and walk your dogs."
Sunset is so beautiful,We walked along Hyundae beach and then through the park and enjoyed the views so much. We then happened upon this park area and had the perfect view of the bridge at sunset. It was stunning!! 
Nura Park on the beach,"the area is beautiful, walk along the beach from Haeundae beach to Nura Park and enjoy the scenery with view on the bridge."
Spectacular walk and a great dinner in APEC,In the late afternoon I went to the Westin Hotel on the beach and walked along the board walk around the rocks and in the shade of the racks and trees.Very nice views of the beach and the sea. It was cool and good exercise as the board walk is more like a series of stairs because of the rocksAt the end of the walk there is a light house looking out to sea and the big suspension bridge.On a subsequent occasion I want to a dinner in the APEC round pavilion. It was an excellent experience. Korean dancing and the meal prepared by the Westin Hotel
A nice attraction close to Haeundae,A great half day visit in Busan. The jagged cliffs are very beautiful and it's neat to stand on the spot where your President or Prime Minister was. It can get windy so hold your hat.
It's a beautiful spot and the building is good,The walk along the cliffs is gorgeous and the location of this building is great. It's a wonderful place to walk to. The interior and exhibits are good.
AN AMAZINGLY BEAUTIFUL PARK,What an amazing park! The beauty of this park can not be captured in pictures! There are many items of historical interest. Walking the perimeter of the park is breathtaking! Don't miss...if you are in Busan!
Great Walking Park,"The walk in the park is circular on ""rubber padded"" foot trails, very easy on the legs and knees. It is a bit hilly but nothing too extreme. Lots of locals jogging and walking their dogs. The APEC building is really nothing more than a large meeting hall where the APEC conference was held a few years ago. Nice building but nothing really special. The real beauty is the setting of the park itself overlooking the water and the city."
Beautiful!,"Wonderful park that has something for everyone. Great place to run (which is what I did from the Park Hyatt), take in the ocean views, see a little history or just take a stroll. Very well constructed with fantastic walking paths with good hills for a nice work out!"
Art Park,This park is something unique for all the masterpieces of art that are displayed within. I really enjoyed see everyone of them. Also the views from the sea are something to remember.
Beautiful Park,Walked around APEC building and grounds. What a beautiful setting on the water amidst the park. It is worth seeing.
Great place to go for a walk. Right next to Haeundae beach.,"This park is clean and really well maintained. The ocean views are great, as are the gardens and you can also visit the APEC hall for a quick view of the exhibits. There are rubber footpaths that are particularly kind on the feet and knees which makes it an even more pleasant place for a walk."
Lovely Sea View,"Be prepared to walk a bit from the metro station and don't forget to bring your umbrella to shelter from rain and sun. I enjoyed the slow walk up-hill from Westin Chosun entrance to APEC house. The environment is so peaceful. The sea view from the APEC house surrounding is spectacular, especially the view facing APEC house and Gwangan bridge. You can take beautiful photographs here.We decided to take a taxi from Westin Chosun to the metro station as we were too lazy to walk and we had to cover a few more attractions. "
From the sea shore,"A brilliant view of the city, with ships in the port, the lighthouse and the bridge. here you can watch the world go by."
Clean and excellent for walks & Jog,"Bang opp our Westin Chosun hotel, Ideal for my morning Jogs, On the ocean bank, Concretised, Early morning you can id several birds Lush green, In Early April you can catch patches of Cherry Blossom. One round is about 900mts & well marked. Clean toilets neatly tucked in discrete corners. There are no food shacks. the famous APEC centre is right in the middle. "
Great around,"The view around the park is great. A must see attraction in Busan. But just have a big conference room to see inside APEC centre. Surrounding is much more fun then inside. Also have a big beach nearby, if going in summer, seems more fun."
Beautiful park,you have to walk quite far. It's a circle. But you have a good view from the top of the hill. And you get to see the hall where the APEC meeting was held. Worth the visit. Good photography location.
Fantastic sea view n APEC'05 memory lane,"It is a challenge walk from subway to APEC building, however we all enjoyed the scenic walk up the slope. There is a short cut path to the building, but with a less scenic view. So is all up to you. If you are keen on what your country minister had eaten and utensils used during APEC 2005, or how the meeting room setting was, then this is the right place to visit. After all, how many of us will get this chance to view? Not to forget, a big thanks to busan officials for keeping and open up this place for visiting. And there is a fantastic sea view from here, bring on your camera."
Nice outing,"We stumbled across this park while walking around Haeundae Beach. It is very clean and the walk along the boardwalk is very well done. The APEC building is nice but not spectacular either. The best part of the park is the safe, scenic walk that comes with this gentle walk just west of the busy downtown strip. It is a very nice way to soqk in the surroundings in Haeundae Beach and look out to the vast ocean and daydream. There is no admission cost and no reason not to explore this real nice little park. "
Nice view. Easy & comfortable access,"As such the building is of historical importance due to APEC 2005. Quite a few historical photographs, videos & memoirs. Worth a visit.The location as such is worth visiting. Its close to the park (walkable from westin) & the view from the left side overlooking the gwangan bridge is iconic. We took a cab here & the cab came via the gwangan bridge and the cab driver showed us the location which was a great view as such.If u r coming from Dongbaek station, then walk towards westin hotel & turn right into the park and u will reach this spot in 10 mts. There is a lighthouse, the stone with carvings of Haeundae (split into 3) & the mermaid statue all within this location. And, one can walk to Haeundae beach & reach Haeundae in 15 mts. So if u r planning to visit this area, try to couple the places together."
breathtaking view,The place is postcard perfect. you can view great sights of busan. Its just that you have to walk which is okay if you cant walk then there is an alternative route however the view will not be that fantastic
beautiful calm place to walk and relax,"beautiful calm place to walk and relax, calm place, with nice views, good for families with small children to spend some fre time together"
Beautiful scenery,"After coming back to Busan from Ulsan, we were too tired to walk up to the APEC House Park but 4 of us enjoyed our walk to the hanging bridge, then to see the round table of where the world leaders had their meeting. Their closing time is 5pm and not 6pm. We were the last tourist to enter before they shut the gate. It's free admission, like most tourist attractions."
A little piece of San Francisco in Busan?,"We walked from the Subway (25mins) in lovely warm weather. Free entry. Park is beautiful - clean, quiet, airy with tree cover and nice walks. Views from the light/clock house are fantastic. Nice pagoda to sit and relax with sea breeze and views. APEC complex was free and lovely too with amazing Bridge views. Photo vistas galore here. Relaxing at every step... Enjoy!"
Not so great place..,Sea views are good. A boring place to visit. This place is very close to many high raised hotels. Wont go again. 
APEC House,"Its a very very long walk from where the city bus stopped. But after that long hot and tiring walk, it was all worth it. The view was spectacular and the breeze was so relaxing. It was nice to see that in one beautiful place, you can appreciate the beauty of Busan. Make it a part of your itinerary! Its a must see in Busan."
Beautiful Views,We came while a typhoon was churning off shore. The waves against the rocks were impressive. I'd love to see this area on a sunny day too!
NICE POINT TO CLICK PICS!!!!,Worth spending a couple of hours... The views are great....A great photo oppurtunity!!!! WORTH VISITING AND DONT MISS...AN OASIS OF GREEN AND BLUE...
Beautiful!,"As one walk towards the APEC Naru Park, the beach welcome you. Not impressive initially, but as you turn and walk along the seaside you will be strike by the beautiful view of the sea, the rock and the many plants and vegetation found here. the trees and plants were very well kept and the maintenance team were seen doing their job professionally. There are many spots where you can take good photos. Defiinitely a place worth visiting while in Busan."
Beautiful site for a Conference.,The walk from our hotel was short and the Center itself had many impressive memorabilia of the first conference. It was ok just because it was a short stop. 
Interesting house,"The APEC house was what the guest house host recommend me to visit, Map location not correct anyway, so better refer somewhere else. Love the surrounding scenery, beautiful landscape view. 10 minutes walk from Hyeundae beach,"
Beautiful sea view,The park is beautiful with spectacular sea view and it is very near to Haeundae Beach and Centum City. It's truly worth visiting.
Loved it,Decent fabulous scenery. Was there upon sunset. They had rabbits by the park which makes the experience a brand new one. Do make a trip down if you are there on holidays and have time to spare. No regrets against the cool breeze and upslope trek in the evening 
Worth a visit if you are close by,"If you are in a hotel close by or it is included on a organised Busan tour, then this is an interesting attraction set in a beautiful surroundings. Be sure to see the conference table where World Leaders and delegations have met. The modern architectural design of the conference centre is interesting and there is a great view of the Gwangan Bridge."
APEC Park,Worth a visit. Wonderful location by the sea and an easy walk in beautiful gardens. Cab ride to hotel is cheap.
Good walk,"If you like to walk around, it is a good place! sound and smell of birds, sea, and tree. all nature~"
Stunning,I liked the location and the forest-feel... The architecture blended well with nature and the floras and faunas are just hauntingly beautiful.
Late afternoon stroll,"Very peaceful stroll and look inside the APEC building which was interesting as mentioned before.Trip down memory lane as most of the Heads of State are no longer in Parliament..Walk easy as pathways built with especially soft underfoot tread? for running and cycling The toilets so clean and modern with piped classical music to boot.Autumn trees in glorious colour,pristine sea and great views out into the ocean along the coastline.Not crowded maybe time of year too. The Haendae Beach is under reconstruction to restore sand to the beach from offshore via pumps but nonetheless families with young children were enjoying the day."
Nice walk and interesting recent history,"This purpose-built building in a lovely peninsular park on the rocky coast was the site of the 2005 APEC summit and is preserved for visitors to see where the world leaders met, including where they sat in the Korean-themed round chamber, and even shows samples of the swag they collected. The view and the shady trails are lovely."
good hike,"From Haendae beach go right to the Westin hotel, on the left there is a wooden stairway that goes around the coastline to the APEC complex. Very interesting, didn't think I would find it so but once we were there I found it great."
Morning walk!,"This park is located in front of Shinsege, the worlds largest department store in Centum City. http://english.shinsegae.com/english/dept/dept_store.asp?STORE_CD=16This is a nice place to take a walk either in the morning or early evening, anytime, really. It s very clean with many sculptures and streetlights in the park illuminate the riverside walkway along the Suyeong River. It's a five-minute walk from subway line No.2, Centum City Station, exit 3."
What a great park,"I really enjoyed jogging around the park, specially on the sea side. You will good spots for taking pictures of haeundae beach, the wonderful rock landscape, or the lighthouse bybthe sea. You will enjoy walking on the cool board walk up and down."
Picturesque site,"aside from the building itself where the 5th APEC was held, take a nice stroll on the outside lower surroundings near the sea, Good spot for taking pictures with wonderful rock landscape, lighthouse at the background and on the other side the long bridge. Can be very romantic spot."
Beautiful n scenic,It's same place as Dongbaek island. Nice boardwalk . You can see gwangali bridge from there. Love the walk there. There is also a little lighthouse . 
Nice place to exercise,"A nice place to do some serious walking. Nice views all round the cape. Lots of school children and teenagers doing group activities the day I went, which was a public holiday. APEC building is forgettable."
"Lovely park, great view, scenic walkway: short visit","Walk from the Westin along the waterfront, it's a cool walkway, and a beautiful park. The views from the point are expansive, and there are coin-fed stationary binoculars to zoom in on the city and distant islands. The APEC house has very modern design, and is cool to walk through (if open.)"
A good location to see Gwangan Bridge,It's not very far from Haeundae beach. I went there at night with friends. You can take photo of Gwangan bridge from the park. I think it deserves to go.
