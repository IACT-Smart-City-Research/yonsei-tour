The good: Cheap. The bad: Cheap,"The staff are just delightful. After pointedly ignoring you at the mysteriously named ""service"" desk, they cna't ignore you any longer, and you get a withering glare, the kind of glare that lets you know that they see right through you, and know your exact type, the type of bumpkin low-life foreigner who is defiling their country, corrupting their youth, stuffing up the economy and is the exact reason why Ittaewon is no longer as great as it once was. Its people like YOU who should go back to whichever ""Western"" country you spawned in. People like YOU, who may stay the night, only on condition you are heading to the airport in the morning. People like YOU, the exact reason why our business is going so badly.And don't even think of stealing anything, cos we got our eyes on you, ttongsaeng. Oh, we know. We know you are here because you are low on cash. Its your exact type who would steal. We are watching you, kiddo. And don't. Jump. The. Queue. We have a system and newbies in this country are messing with the harmony. We will attend to you once we finish arguing with these middle-easterners about why we cannot give them a discount from Agoda, basically because we are sick and tired and don't like the look of them. We have a system, and you must follow it, so wait your turn like the rest!Once you survive the ""service"" desk, the standard dungeon baths and free earbuds made out of twigs and recycled Chinese toilet paper follow. You leave feeling quite refreshed after the initial ordeal, and the lamian-making ajjuma on the upper levels is much nicer. She was fat and round and delightful and has the face of someone who had a hard life and a soft heart, and she wished me a delicious meal. She was lovely.After slurping down your lamian from a badly-panelbeaten Chosun-dynasty aluminium bowl in the cool gloom, you explore the actual facilities available. Most are out of order. What is encouraging to see is that the interior appears to have at least been refurbished several times since the Japanese left Korea (the early 20th century, to be clear...not the time before that), and it seems that the last update was done some time in the early or mid 90s.You find there is nothing to really do, you give up and decide its time to sleep. From the enormous pile of neck rests, made from a mixture of what seems to be pulverized concrete and antique fake vinyl that was originally pretending to be fake leather, you pick one that feels that at probably won't slide around too much from its oiliness.Oiliness.A thought occurs. I wonder if...Its too late, and you have already raised the neck-rest to your nose, and take a whiff. An incredible aroma, a new smell you have dreamed of, but in nightmares smashes through your brain. Your senses light up from a truly unique smell, the smell of history, the combined hair-smell of half a century of Itaewon Land patrons. And, oh, why, oh why did I wonder if...?You rationalize that if you don't use a neck-rest, you will wake up with an even worse headache than the normal headache you get from these useless Jimjilbang neck-rests. And anyway, as terrible as it is, it will wash away in the dungeons in the morning.My advice is to suffer the worse jimjilbang headache sans Superfund-site-neck-rest and save yourself some trauma. Because trauma heals only with time, and you will smell that amazing smell in your mind and nostrils for the weeks to come. And when you write your review on Trip Advisor, that smell will return to the front of your mind with extremely high resolution. Trust me, a headache is but a minor pain; hair-smell is everlasting.Dragging your fetid neck-rest out at arms-length, you find it depressingly easy to find a position to sleep in, as the cavernous sleeping area is devoid of human life, and you are reminded that the universe is big and that you are very, very much alone. In Ittaewon Land, no-one can hear you scream: After a heated argument amongst themselves, the Middle-Easterners took Trip Advisor's sage advice and have already taken a taxi to the much friendlier and hygienic Silloam Bulgama Sauna, on the west side of town.I highly suggest this as a place to go if you are low on cash and are really needing to find a place to sleep pronto, and happen to find yourself in Ittaewon at 11PM wondering what to do next. Preferably solo, because friends don't let friends stay at crappy jimjjilbangs. Unless you are with a friend and both low on cash and luck, and its not that close of a friend, then it is cool. You can always make a new, better friend at some other point in life, no?In the morning, the staff are a lot more cheerful, probably because you are on your way, and like most customers, will probably never show your face there again.In such a big, and generally quite hygienic and (kind of) friendly country as Korea, Ittaewon Land is quite a special experience."
Typical humble Jjimjilbang. Don't expect much.,"This is a good place to experience Jjimjilbang culture for the first time.The price isn't that high and humble.- The building is locating on a hill after many steps.- The reception was kind to us.- The facility is old and rusty. But, maintained well.- Even though Itaewon is an area with many foreigners, we have seen many locals during weekday evening.- We had a discount coupon from social web market and it was quite affordable after discount.- They have basic things for jjimjilbang. A snack bar, a massage room, a sleeping room, a common hall, various egloos, hot baths, etc."
old but perfect,"surpricingly fast ad super serviceminded staff, everyone could communicate in english and every time I went into a new room someone was waiting for me to guide me further on. I almost had it all to myself (11pm-2am) and the massage was perfect. Lots of different activities and saunas, great food and very authentic. Everything was worn and old, but worked perfectly and had personality to it. I recommend. even the staff was all about 60+"
Traditional Korean spa and massage place,It is a extremely traditional Korea Spa and massage place. Kinda like those traditional Onsen in Japan. However given the location it feels a little odd to have a facility like this at the busy foreigners hang on area. The oil massage was done by a matured lady but it was actually quite good. Despite I won't say it is cheap and maybe can find better valued alternatives nearby. 
Staff are mean!!,"I had a card that said ""lifetime membership"" that gives me discounts to this place as well as the services within. The man at the counter just took it from me without explaining anything and when I asked he said, ""it's finished."" I said but it says lifetime and it doesn't have an expiration date. He said, "" it's finished because I said it's finished."" Then at the restaurant, they have menus up that you're not able to order from anymore, apparently. But when u ask about it the grouchy lady will just cut u off mid sentence and say, we don't have it. Then when I asked, is it just that item or the entire menu, she walked away. LOLThis isn't a language barrier btw, I'm Korean-American and I do speak semi-fluently. The pic below is a lie... "
Run down bath house,"First of all: Korean bath houses have gone a long way from the communities only place to have a shower to today's spa temples they often are. Unfortunately, the Itaewon Land got lost somewhere along the way.The admission is 10.000 Won, but that only includes bathing and a pretty small and simple sauna with a steam room and a dry sauna at about 60°C. If you're looking for a Finnish sauna, you won't find it here.The pools we're poor and far away from state of the art, the water wasn't clean.The staff was unfriendly and would only help if you insist.The food is basic and expensive.Even if you are a foreigner, there are many other bath houses you can go to. There's no need to go to Itaewon Land unless you don't know how to ride a subway."
Hôtel Itaewon Land à Seoul,Itaewon Land is a hotel AND a spa. Women and Men are separated. You can find 5 different waterpools (not for smimming). The hotel is extremely clean. And has 24hozrs Restaurant service.
Basic sauna and spa,"Itaewon land holds an imposing position above the thriving nightlife of Itaewon.It's been a bit run down and there are cracks int the tiles indicating it's past it's glory days. But on the other hand it's six bucks for a shower and sauna and for that well,you can't be too fussy. It fitted the purpose so I can say I was satisfied. Further up the hill you can pay 50 bucks to use the Hyatt spa. It's a totally upmarket experience but the result is probably not that far apart physically. So if you want a shower spa and sauna without frills Itaewonland is worth remembering Itaewonland."
Easy to find Halal food here,"The Seoul sentral mosque is located in this area, which means many halal food restaurants here. Indian food, Arabian food, Korean food, and others. Most of them are affordable. I remember when I visited Korea in 2010, almost every night I went to Itaewon just to have halal food for dinner. I have not explore the area yet, just visit the Masjid and halal restaurants here. "
Hostel meets Jimjimbang,This place is excellent and cheap if you're looking for both a private room and a shared Korean bathhouse experience. I like to stay here when I visit Seoul city as the location is excellent.
Traditional Korean Spa,"I was debating between Itaewon Land and Dragon Hill, but I'm really glad I chose Itaewon. If you're looking for a truly traditional Korean spa, this is it. No frills just a well used bath house. My friend's mom who is Korean went all the time and I didn't want the touristy version of a spa. I was confused at the process since everyone was Korean and only the front desk staff speak English but it was delightful. I paid a total of 78000 won for the entrance, scrub, and massage. Worth it. The scrub was amazing and you get a face mask, shampoo and conditioner while she's (half naked) rubbing you down with oils. I felt a little weird not knowing how to scrub myself on the stools and just enjoying the whirlpools but I went with it. Give up your body inhibitions and you'll have a great time hanging with Korean ladies of all ages and sizes. "
A bit run down and tacky,"The smell of mildew and the ugly, phallic taps sum it really. Needs a face lift. It's a shame as it's a very central location for tourists so many will be left with a poor impression of korean spa."
An interesting experience,"This public bath and sauna is really something new for me. first you have to take a shower in an open bath (separated by gender of course) and then you can to soak in a Korean style onsen in the bath itself. after which, you get to experience rooms of different temperatures from an ice room to a room I dared not enter because it was so hot my face felt like it was going to urn off"
A different hotel choice,"I had visited Spa Land last time in Seoul and decided to stay in one of their cabins for a couple of nights as I really only needed a place to drop my bag and get a few hours sleep.The rooms are basic, mattress on the floor with a small desk and a fan. There is little ventilation in the room when the door is closed so you will appreciate the fan.There is a toilet on the same floor as the rooms, but to bathe you will need to use the public wet areas on level one. This is probably the main reason to stay as you can use the facilities as much as you like.As other reviewers have said, the place is run down. It's glory days were a few years ago but I think that's part of its charm.I enjoyed my stay here. I wasn't looking for anything fancy and enjoyed being able to go for a quick soak after being out sightseeing all day. If none of that puts you off give it a try."
Stayed for a week...and perspired,"You're not going to get a better or more authentic Korean bathhouse experience than this place. I came with 3 friends in July 2014 and stayed in a single room for 6 nights. It was July. It was hot. The room had no air conditioning. They did provide a fan, but it didn't do much. The showers are communal, and the toilets might as well have been. The biggest turn off was the permitting of smoking in the toilet area. The best thing I can say was the price. I don't know of a cheaper single room offer in Itaewon. The room itself is clean and the towels are provided. "
Absolutely rundown.,Facility is really old. I think travel books recommendations were long ago. 5 pools in the bath. 2 cool 2 warm. 1cold and one unused. The only nice place here is gravel walk room and free WiFi. Phone charging cost 1000W but you can use your own charger for free. Food were OK and fair priced. Certainly not a hotel or even hostel. If you wanna book hostel there are a lot more around this area. Weekdays almost empty. Scary.
Don't try to use the gym here,"I went in here while staying in itaewon. Unlike other places which combine sauna with gym, the gym here is a sort of april fools joke. Actually the fitness area should be condemned and closed down. I suspected something was amiss when i got there and no one else was there with all the machines turned off. There's only about 6 different machines, no freeweights, the 4 treadmills are ALL old and defective (even dangerous to use cos they don't keep a steady pace) and only one or two machines were undamaged and actually working. What an utter embarrassment."
Make sure you know what you are signing up for!,"Firstly, I would like to point out that we didn't sign up to stay here voluntarily. A problem at the hotel we were supposed to stay in left us in Seoul at 5pm with nowhere to stay. Therefore, we had to look for somewhere with availability - and this was pretty much it.The location is very good - in terms of it is in the centre of Itaewon's nightlife district. However, my advice would be to make sure you enter and leave the hotel via the huge flight of stairs directly in front of it. The area immediately to the left as you come out of the guesthouse is seedy - with a number of obvious ""bars"" providing ""massage services"". Walk past them and barely dressed women will come out to try to ""tempt"" you in. Saying that, if you have mobility issues this would be the only way to access the hotel - the stairs aren't for the feint-hearted or unfit!When we arrived, the lady on the desk was very helpful and spoke good English. Although we had made the booking on (very) short notice, she managed to find us a couple of rooms and checked us in. The first thing that strikes you about this property is that it's actually a public spa with a few rooms on the top floor tacked on as a ""hotel"". To get up to the rooms you have to go through the spa floor which was generally full of naked men heading to the sauna.The room itself was fucntional and relatively clean - but I was concerned about the security. Seems that once spa guests are in the building they have free access to wander around anywhere including the ""hotel"" floor. The doors were secured only by a padlock and seemed so flimsy that given a couple of kicks you could gain access - not really somewhere I wanted to be leaving a £700 Macbook Air and various other electronic travel gadgets!The other issue I had was that when the hotel says the showers are shared - what they mean is that they are communal. If you want a shower you need to get naked and go into the Spa's showers with any other guys who may be in there at the time. That's fine if you are OK with that - many people might not be.So all in all, I wouldn't stay here by choice again - make sure you realise this isn't really a proper ""hotel"" before you sign up for it."
Don't do it,"While it is just 8,000 won to enter, it is unbelievably run down and dirty. The bath area in the women's section was just filthy and the sauna in that section was not warm let alone hot enough to be termed a sauna. Additionally you have to pay extra to use the hairdryer, while it is just 200 won, give me a break! Overall, it's just not a place you want visit and not worth your time."
Bad experience!!!,"I had a very bad experience in itaewon land. First, it was an old-interior and running down. I felt not so right when i entered the reception. But still it was introduced by lots of travel books and websites, so i decided to give it a chance. Then, it came to worst part. The bath area was small and a bit dirty. There 3-4 hot baths in there. I choose one of it which has no one inside. And it was ""so damn dirty'. There are dross and hairs floating around me. I cant imagine how it could be happen on that place. I just cant stand it. This is my ever first comments to tourism place. A friendly reminder to all future people who want to visit to this place. if you want to go to jimjilbang, i would recommend you to Sparex spa (near dongdaemun cultural & history park). It was great, clean & comfortable."
cheapest place to stay,"In Korea you can stay in Sauna, which is a spa , fulfilled for sleeping. Those are the cheapest accommodations so don't think about a service. If u expect nice service, never stay here.Just around $8 for 1night roughly, and there are small room for each person so that u can go inside and sleep.I can definitely say that this Sauna is better than most other ones.You are travelling Korea so i recommend u to experience Koreans' cheapest and popular accomodation at least once.So try!"
Worst sauna ive been to in Korea,"I've visited a several saunas in Seoul and this was by far my worst experience. I felt the place was a little dirty with bins overflowing. The manger was very rude when I suggested informing customers or having a sign about a 1,000 won fee to charge mobile phones. I have no problem paying this but it would have been nice to know before handing over my phone."
"Love the place, dislike the cafeteria","It was our first time visiting a public bath/sauna, so we don't know what to expect.The ahjusi(maybe the owner) was really kind and helpful although he doesnt speak english.Luckily i watch a lot of drama and koeran tv show, so i can speak and understand a little bit of basic korean.I came here with my 2 sisters and stayed for 1 night in a 3 person room. After we register, they gave each of us a key for our shoe locker. And the key is really important, because they also use the key to record in the system of the things we purchase something while we are here in ( food, facilities etc), and pay the total when you check out.Room is quite clean but is a little hot, since they don't have ceiling fan and no windows, all we have is a small portable fan. When we were there, 2 ahjummas we watching dramas on Tv on the hall, (the hall is in between the public bath/hot spring section and the locker section)The ahjummas on woman bath section was really nice and try to help us even though she cant speak english ( seems like no one speak english well here), because we were wondering how to enter the public bath room properly. And she explains to us that we have to take off everything (even the underwear) when we are in the locker room, and cross the hall naked (where the ahjuma watch drama) then enter the public bath(still naked). Once you are inside, you have to shower and clean yourself before you can enter the hot spring.So ya if you are a first time visitor, Be ready to be naked in public. And to shower/bath in public.Well, that's why the name is Public Bath.We didn't know, so we ask the ahjumma again and again and finally we did as what she said. (After 20 minutes thinking and regretting our decision to come in the locker room)We didnt have a choice as they do not have a private bathroom.We were really embarrassed for the first 10 minutes, but as time goes by, i am able to enjoy the hot spring. Not sure about my 2 sisters though. Because the next morning they just wash their face, but i woke up early to enjoy the hot spring with less embarrassment.As for food, we have dinner at their cafeteria ( seems like they only have one cafeteria).And service was really bad.Not too much people when we were here, but the ahjumma that's in the kitchen seem to ignore us. I was standing at the counter almost in front of her. I know she saw me but she pretend to not know, so i said excuse me for 2 times, then she look at me and say something like this ""Please go and sit first, and order later.""I was frustrated. Was not rude but was not polite either. Face was really annoyed because i think she was eating something when i ask her.We ate sundubujigae, 1 noodle cup, and 2 ice coffee. Wanted to order jiajyangmian and fried chicken which is on their menu, but she said they don't have it. Iced coffee is really bad, not worth the money. Was tasteless and bland and when i ask for sugar, and the other ahjumma was staring at me as if were scared i finish the liquid sugar. When i put the sugar on the table, she came and ask for the sugar bottle.After dinner, we went to try for the facilities. They have some massage chair and some exercising equipment (but you need to put coin in it). The things that are free is the Tv they have, big spaces to sleep or rest, and the sauna room.I love the sauna rooms. They have a few, ranging from the ice room, charcoal room, and few sauna room with different temperature. Overall, it was a great experience.(except the cafeteria ahjumma) Definitely will come again. The owner gave us free BAP latest album when we check out. Don't know why i'm so happy even though i'm not a fan of Kpop."
