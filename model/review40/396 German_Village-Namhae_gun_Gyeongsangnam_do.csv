German village,The village does look like a German village. I don’t think it is worth an extra trip unless you are passing by. The food was good but somewhat expensive.
A quaint place with a beautiful story,Staying in a guesthouse here was really comfortable and felt like home. The village houses a museum where we learnt a bit about the sacrifices of the Koreans who moved to Germany to work in order to build up their country. Beautiful place with beautiful people!
Best relaxing and beautiful place,The history about this place wonders me and being there was so relaxing . Trying German food here in korea was also interesting. The island is so beautiful that I want to just live there for the rest of my life.
Beautiful houses with special story,"There has a different feeling from other places in Korea as all the buildings are built like German houses. We didn't have enough time to surf it during the day and also it was rainy so I think we couldn't see the beauty of that place as it was. I would like to be there one more time on a sunny day. But I don't recommend this place to stay and sleep at night. Especially in summer, there are various kinds of insects in the rooms that don't let you sleep peacefully."
Hidden gems in Namhae,"It's a very cute little neighborhood with beautiful scenery, German style houses with red roofed ,white walls and little yards. It is a great weekend getaway with family and friends!"
Feels Like in A Real German,"Like this place because the atmosphere here is just like in German. Even the people there also can speak english. I remember the owner of villa that I stayed, she is really kind and nice."
NAMHAE GERMAN VILLAGE,"More than the beautiful and accommodating village, the history and story of the village touched my heart. Knowing all the beautiful details of the past which linked Korea and Germany in the Museum inside the village was thrilling. I would love to visit there again soon."
Jest like paradise,"I visited here on late July. As I arrived I faced with breathtaking scenery, pretty quite area, birds singing along in a beautiful foggy day. In south Korea where you are surrounded by tall apartments, being in a peaceful place such as German village is pleasant. House style in the village is unique there are also guest house there. the photo that I attached is sweet view of our balcony. Don't know how pleasing was walking up to this awesome view. Btw I should mention that equipment in the room that we were was not modern or high-tech; it was as simple as a house in beautiful village~~ Room very clean, big and cozy."
Beautiful and historical place in Korea,"German village is special place for Koreans. I recommend to visit this place for nature lovers, there are amazing view and a lot of beautiful houses in the German style. as well as many large and wide cafes. my friends and I settled in cozy cottages. spent a good time in a quiet and calm atmosphere and learned a lot about the historycal relations of Korea and Germany."
Highly recommended,"The German village consists of authentic german architecture houses made with german materials imported from Germany. The initial purpose of the German village was to help korean miners and nurses who worked in the 1960s at Germany to adjust and relocate back in Korea. Now, the village has transformed into a tourist spot and provides all visitors an authentic german experience, check out german pubs selling draft beer as well as restaurants serving german food such as bockwurst."
Highly recommended,"German village, as the name says, is a mini Germany in South Korea. The village is built on the request of Koreans who spent a large span of their lives in Germany in order to develop their country in the 1960’s. The village provides an outlook of German style house, comfortable environment, and beautiful restaurants. Highly recommended to spend a night to enjoy the view and the environment. Lastly, don’t forget to visit the museum."
Must visit,"It is a village that welcome visitors to stay for the night and chill out with German cultural activities. The environment was perfect to chill, fitting families with children, fitting group of friends, fitting couples. We stayed at Essen House for one night, my other friends from other houses were satisfied too, waking up with coffee and breakfast prepared by the most kind and lovely hosts."
Disappointed ,"I was really looking forward to seeing more “German” in the German Village. The location was beautiful n there are some really nice really homes reminiscent of those in Germany but all in all, the experience was a bit disappointing. It would have been better to visited without any expectations."
Fun time during the annual Oktoberfest Festival,"It was enjoyable for us, including our 2 year old. The place is stroller accessible except the Village is on a hill. There are many picturesque photo opportunities here. We had fun and would like to come again. There’s also a garden nearby worth visiting if you’re in the area anyway."
2017 Oktober fest,"Beer fest in German town on 10.6~8, 2017.If you want to try fest like oktober fest in German, please try hear as mini fest."
Expected to see a German village in Korea,"Expected to see a German village in S. Korea ended up with a big disappointment. The exact description for it is ''Kittch'' . Few German style houses, overpriced food beer and souvenirs."
Too touristic,"The place full of restaurant and hotel with higher price, it is too crowded and touristic. nothing special for me."
A Taste of Germany in South Korea,"My friends and I decided to take a road trip to Namhae. The main attraction we wanted to see was the German Village.Using the navigator app, we found the village. However, because it was a holiday, Children's Day, there was a lot of traffic. We decided to park at the bottom of the hill and walk up, instead of driving in slow traffic and spending time looking for parking. The weather was overcast but we left our umbrellas in the car hoping we would be fine. During our visit, it started to rain. On our way down to the car, there was a store selling disposable ponchos, which many were buying.The houses in the village looked authentically German down to the house number signs and some home mailboxes, fences, chimneys, gates, and overall design of the homes.There were several lookout points overlooking the Village, the Windbreak Forest and sea below. There were many places to eat as well, with German-like terraces to eat outside with wooden tables and table umbrellas.Locals whom I spoke to were all helpful and friendly. There were a few foreigners walking around as well, tourists.I learned a little history about the German Village. After the Second World War, Korean nurses and miners were invited to live and work in Germany, and given German citizenship in exchange. These workers then returned to Korea, to retire, some years back and decided to settle in Namhae, and call their place, 'German Town' or 독일마을. Today, there are just 26 such workers left residing in the village. Many of the their German-born children still live in Germany and don't speak much Korean.The food looked good. The most authentic parts of our 'German' meal were the sausages and Paulaner Beer. 'Foreign' food in Korea is often adjusted to the Korean palate, I've noticed.I would definitely recommend the German Village to visitors, if that's an interest."
A small town... to visit...,This is a great place if you like to know the struggles of korea's past. I can not say I love this place because its a reminder to korea's struggle. Good for a 40 min. hangout. 
Well..,It was 40min drive from the resort I stayed in. This place came to be commercialized after spotted by some enthusiastic broadcasters of earlier years.This place itself now does not have much point since many of original residents had left. I would not have spent 40min on the road if I had known this place. If you have too much time to kill it would not be bad as I thought it was.40분이나 멀미에 시달리며 간 것 치고는 좀 그랬습니다 볼것도 즐길 것도 너무 부족했고 옆에 예술촌 정원은 좀 볼거리가 있었으나 입장료에 비하면 이게 뭔가-란 생각이 개인적으로 들었습니다.제가 구경한 독일마을은 입장료가 없어 좋았지만 군데군데서 파는 아이스크림과 여타 음식들은 가격대비 질이 너무 별로였습니다 전형적인 관광지 요금이었죠 안타까운 생각이 들었습니다. 마을 위 박물관은 저렴하고 아기자기한 전시물이 좋았다고 생각합니다. 
Summer break,"German village has some garden for sight seeing and many place to stay. Only a few building feel like in german, but the ambience of the village is really nice."
A Nice Day Trip,The German Village is best appreciated if you take the time to study the historical relationship between South Korea and Germany. The scenery is very nice with mountains and foothills ending at the harbor. Good small restaurant choices with German beer and traditional German food. 
German village for lunch,"Was quite amazed to find this village, it is nicely laid out on the style of a German village so is different from the traditional Korean style of housing. Very busy as it is quite popular. The German restaurant serves up nice, if a little expensive, food. Well worth a visit."
Are you kidding,This is for Korean locals who never had chance to visit outside of their country. Faked German village with no resemblance of any German town but group of townhouse in western style with cafes to attract local visitor. Not worth to visit unless you just pass by along your journey. Definitely not a tourist attraction
"Interesting, but not worth diverting for","Recognised as a tourist destination, but there is really not much here. Quite bizarre to see European houses built (and still being built) in a Korean landscape. The Oktoberfest banners and German beers seemed strangely out of place, although the reasons for the historical German links are well documented. "
German Village in Namhae,Retired miners and nurses who were dispatched to Gernany in the sixties returned here and built beautiful European houses. German Beer Festival is held here every October.
You forget you're in South Korea being here,"When you learn the history of why this village exists in South Korea, it makes the experience more rewarding. Nice landscape. So much to explore in a small area. Great cafe spots on the way to the top. There is a souvenir shop that will satisfy your German needs. Definitely recommend as a must-see in Namhae-do"
a hidden jem in Namhae island,We found this by an accident when we were driving to Namhae. The location is a bit far compare to other attraction in Namhae. There are nice buildings designed German style. There are two cafes here but one was still under renovation. The other cafe has a nice view of the ocean and the forest hills. The location is fantastic with a perfect weather in September. So if you have time go to German village and roam around the buildings sit in the cafe grab some bites and drinks. 
"Interesting, but not great","Interesting, but when we were there, many things were closed. There are basically many pensions (B&Bs) and cafes, but really, the only thing worth seeing there is the Korean Workers museum at the top of the hill, which is only in Korean and German."
German village of Namhae,"The village is built around the theme of European streets and housing. All the houses are red roofed and built of stone blocks. The village itself is situated in most beautiful area surrounded by forest and sea. There are so many attraction to enjoy as well near the village. There are museums, restaurants, and festivals held every year. "
German Village 독일마을,"This village are actually homes to Koreans who have stayed and worked in Germany during the 1960's (maybe even until today). They have built their own community, the houses incorporates German designs. Basically, everything they like/love in Germany, they brought home to Korea.It is situated in mountain hills, facing the sea, so you can imagine how nice the view is.The houses are too cute. Even if they have the same color (same roof and wall paint), they differ in design and have the most amazing landscape. We went there post-spring so the surroundings are all green and flowery. Good for photo shoot.You can actually rent these houses. Majority of them are Pension house (vacation house). I’m just not sure about the price though I heard they are a bit expensive as compare to the other Pension house in southern part of Korea.We just went there to check the place, eat German sausages and drink beer. (Yes, a little bit pricey too).Speaking of beer, yes, they do have October Fest. Visitor can come and party. Might as well try renting the house so you do not have to worry where to sleep or going home drunk."
