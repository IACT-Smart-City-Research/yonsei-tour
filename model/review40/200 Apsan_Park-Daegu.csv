Good view,Apsan means the front mountain of Daegu that you park your car in the parking lot with free and then walk up of the mountain around 10 minutes then there is a cable car such as funicular charged around $2.00. It takes a couple of minutes and then show up the glass deck. You can watch the greatest Daegu panorama view.
The Trail Worth Walking Even At Night plus Good View about Daegu Townscape from Observatory.,Pal Gong Mountain and Apsahn that means Front Mountain in Korean surround Daegu City. However Pal Gong Mt is further from downtown or core of the city than Apsahn. Therefore Daegu townscape can be seen better at the Apsahn Observatory than many peaks of Pal Gong Mt. People can either use a cable car or walk to the Observatory. If people would intend to walk to the Observatory they could get off a bus or park their car near the Ahn Ji-Rang Gol Exercise Park. Then they can climb the mountain following the trail via the Ahn Il Sah Buddhist Temple. Even at night they can do thanks to many street lights along the trail until the Observatory. It takes 1~2 hours from the start line to the original position via the Observatory as a halfway point.
Be prepared for high-slopes and long flights of stairs.,"The view of Daegu on the observatory was worth it! We decided to hike instead of riding a cable car. A bottle of water should come in handy. But there is also a vending machine and a restroom at the middle of the trail near the temple. You can also see a variety of woodpeckers and tits. Would recommend if you want to clear your mind and keep your body in shape. As beginners, we hiked for around 2.5 to 3 hours back and forth."
Great place for a hike!,"Awesome place for a hike right in the middle of a city of 3 million people! Super nice trails with hikes for beginners, intermediated, and experts! Best of all is after your hike there are plenty of places to enjoy a nice Korean meal and adult beverage "
Worth the walk,"My friend and I took the bus to 앞산 and we walked to the cable car station, it was only about 600 meters but its a little bit of a walk (very pretty scenery along the way). The cable car ride had great views (better than 남산 in 서울 in my opinion). There's a little cafe after the cable car, my friend got ice cream and she said it was delicious. The views once you walk to the observatory are absolutely amazing, you can see the whole city and surrounding mountains. Definitely recommend spending a day here!"
Stunning!,My korean friend helped me to get there (without car it can be difficult) and I'm in love! The way to up is kinda hard and you can sweat like crazy but the view is worth everything! Adorable area while climbing and great spot to take photos.
Wow view.,You will need to walk up hill which is rather steep before you reach the cable car station for the ride to the top to have a fantastic view of the city. Not recommended for old folks or people who have walking issues. At the end it's worth the effort.
Nice sunset & night view,Very nice sunset and night view from the observatory desk. Very cold up there so be reminded to bring along a jacket. 
Worth the hike! ,I’ve been wanting to check out Apsan mountain and it did NOT disappoint. It’s truly beautiful and there’s two observatories at the top. Not a bad hike. 
Hiking,"Cable car ride was only average. Big and shared, left every few minutes instead of a constant one. Walking to the cable car is a bit of a distance as well so if you cant walk long distance, get a cab. There was a hiking trail but i went too late so didnt use it. The observatory at the top had a decent view, but i believe hiking up higher would have a nicer view. Restaurant inside serves a small menu, a tad expensive but has a camera view of cable car to show when the next cable car would leave. Above the restaurant had another observation deck."
Expensive ride for a quick view.,From memory it was about 12000 won for the cable car which you have to wait for and share with up to 20 people.There is only one going up as the other is coming down.You have to wait up to 20 minutes for a car.It takes about 10 minutes each way.At the top there is a cafe and some walks which are not well marked.No English.There is a view.
Nice Walk,If you're in the area it's worth visiting. Some nice outdoor walks and a cable car up the mountain for around US$10 return. Cafe at the top of the mountain. Not super fancy so probably not worth a long special trip. 
Amazing ,It’s a very good place in deagu South Korea. We enjoyed in cable car also it’s highest and place good place
With nature,"We spent the day out at Apsan Park. Caught the 410-1 bus to the end stop. Walked a short distance to the cable car entry (do stop by the Korean War Memorial and have a look inside), and take the ride up to the top. From there, we didn't go to the Observatory, but walked the steep 1km (worthwhile walk) to the top of Apsan Mountain. The view was amazing (not necessary to go to the Observatory if you go to the top as the view is better). Also there were not many people there.We wanted to walk to the King's Cave, but took the same way down to a junction in the path (no sign, but the rope barriers to indicate the alternate way down) and ended up at the Unification Wish Stone Pagoda via a very steep and rocky pathway (need good walking shoes for this part). This way down was really lovely. We past several older Korean citizens going for their 'regular' walks (very inspiring). We then came across the Ansil-sa Temple, walked down a very steep road before finding the bus stop at the end to take us back on the 410. A lovely day out filled with blue skies and nature !!!"
Walk up. its worth it,"whether its cable car, or walk, either is fine.the view at the top is worth the trip there.nice cooling air."
Cable car for one please,"Trip Advisor does it again.!!!! Aspan Park was amazing and the cost of the cable car was cheap a round trip for two was only ₩19000. The viewfrom the top was breath taking its only 1600m above sea level not much of an issue dealing with the lack of O2. The view reminded me of Monserrate in Bogota, Colombia. Just not as crowded and I will definitely visit again and walk the trails to the top."
Fantastic panoramic view ,"Get a bird's eye view of Daegu city from the observatory deck, short walk from the cable car station. Other than the observatory deck, there is nothing much except for a local restaurant. "
Nice view,Got the daegu city tour bus from out front of the novatel in Daegu. Took about 30min to get to the base of the park. 15 min walk to cable carCable cars leave to summit every 15min. Once on top spectacular view of the city and surrounds. Restaurant closed for renovations though. Probably pick a cooler day then when we went as sweat reminiscent of Borneo jungle.
Beautiful view of the city.,"We took the cable car to the top as we did not have the time to hike up. It would be another 10 minutes walk to viewing area. Depending on the time of the day and weather, it was quite a sight from the top. If there is only one place to visit while in the city, this is the place to visit."
Spectacular views and great hiking!,"We lived on the 13th floor and our view was Apsan mountain. We crossed the street and were hiking on the trail network which included Buddhist temples, wooden bridges, pristine forest and a Korean War museum. For those who prefer there is a cable car which brings you up to the top where you can enjoy a breathtaking view of Daegu and the surrounding area. We truly enjoyed our two years on living next to this beautiful park."
"Beautiful view, nice cable car, cute cafe near by",I went there with 2 friends. We had no time for hiking so we took the cable car and hiked for 10 minutes to the top. we arrieved right on time to take amazing sunset pictures and we had lots of fun.(I have a full vlog from this place)Near the cable car there is a coffee shop with delicious cookies.
"View of the whole city of Daegu, you can see from there. Apsan very steep mountain.","Apsan means ""front mountain"".Apsan park is located lower part of the mountain, not top. So don't be misguided. You have to search the location of observatory with the name, ""앞산전망대"".Actually, your destination must be ""Apsan Observatory"", not Apsan Park. Very high and has a good view. You can see the whole Daegu city there. It is not the summit. You have to climb up about 1km more from there. Weekends there are many visitors. If you like hiking, you don't need to take a cable car(funicular). You can see the city surrounded by mountains. Very good. It seems to me that it is the top side(destination) of the Cable Car(gondola). To get the Apsan Observatory, you have to walk down more a little bit from the arrival point of the cable car.Also you can find Daedeok Fortess remains.Daedeok Mountain Fortress.There is not many left there. But you may find some remains there. Daegue is surrounded by mountains and Nakdong River, which means it is very good place for defending from enemies.이거 리뷰가, 한글만 글자 카운터에 들어간다니. 이건 뭐냐...영어는 왜 안돼? 어쨌든, 여기 대구 시가 한눈에 보임. 전망대를 찾아가길 권장."
Great hiking with good view ,I decided to do the hiking for this trip and I chose Apsan park ! The way to do hiking was good and had a nice temple on the way. It developed a lot for convenient of the visitor. The view I got was wonderful. 
A pleasant hike and surprisingly good restaurant at the top,"The hike to the scenic overlook is easy, but to the top is more challenging. Worth it on a clear day for the great views of the city. The restaurant has good fried rice and Korean Pancakes. "
Great views of Daegu ,"I went on a sunny day in march and the views from the top were great - on one side, the faded green of more mountains stacked in to the distance, on the other side the city of Daegu (which I hadn't realised was so big!) There are lots of trails and it's well signposted in Korean and English with distances marked to the next point as well. You can hike up to Mt Apsan and a couple of the other peaks, or follow one of the trails along a valley walk. Some of the paths are quite smooth and surfaced with a kind of mat, but others are steeper and more rugged so there's something for most levels of fitness, whether you want an easier walk or more intense hike. It doesn't take long to get there by subway and bus either. A nice day out for a breath of fresh air from the city. "
Night hike to Aspan observatory,"I hiked in the early evening to Mt. Aspan's observatory. It is quite cold in winter, but the steep hike will really warm you up quickly. The hike isn't too difficult, mostly on a paved road for 1km. The rest is through stairs made from rock. There are lights throughout the trail, so I didn't use a flashlight. There are quite a bit of families at the observatory. It has a pretty nice view of the city in the evening. I would like to try it on a clear day next time, but I probably won't return to Daegu anytime soon. "
Apsan park hike ,"Date of visit-2017.10.22 Apsan park (대구앞산공원) is one of the largest and major eco-parks situated in Daegu, South Korea. This park has several trails mainly connecting the Mt.Sanseong (산성산), Mt.Cheongryong (청륭산), Mt.Apsan (앞산) and Mt.Daedeok(대덕산) from which you can choose the best that fits to you. (In case of me, I climbed all the four mountains in one day.. in fact a tough hike of nearly 20kms on foot)As it was autumn, surrounding was very beautiful. Best eye catching view of whole Daegu city can be seen from top of Mt.Daedeok.Transportation> Take subway line 1 from Daegu to Anjirang Station. Take exit no:4. Take 410-1 bus and get down at the last station. When you come back take 410 bus (not 410-1) to Anjirang fourway junction and take the subway from Anjirang.#Apsan_park #Daegu #산성산 #앞산 #대덕산 #청륭산 #Mt_Apsan #Mt_Daedeok #Mt_Cheongryong #Mt_Sanseong #south_korea #hiking"
Panaromic view of daegu,"Surprisingly this place have better lookup point compares to N Seoul tower, which cost much more in terms of entry fee."
Worth it ,"Cable car cost 9500won per adult. Waiting time is 15minutes. It's quite cold and windy so make sure you have your jacket. There's a snack bar too. View is amazing. Be prepared for a 15mins walk to the cable car area, slightly longer than Palgongsan. "
Loved this!,"We only had 24 hours in Daegu, so we chose this as our main activity for the day. We took the subway and then a bus to the park entrance. It's a short stroll up to the cable cars through a beautiful forest. The cable car ride was beautiful. Then we had lunch at the restaurant at the top which was great. The potato joen (pancake was delicious as was the pajeon (green onion pancake) and we really enjoyed the dumpling soup. Plenty for 4 to share, all washed down with makgeolli. Yum. Then we spent a few minutes on the rooftop observatory before climbing up a little higher. Beautiful resting places all along the way, great places to have a picnic. On our way out, we stopped in at the Korean War Museum. The man at the reception desk was wonderful, taking us through the first few rooms and describing the exhibits as there wasn't too much english there. He also gave us a book that gives a detailed account of the war. Remarkable. A wonderful way to spend 3-4 hours! If we had more time, I would have loved to try more of the hiking trails...oh well, next time!"
As close to the nature as you get near the city.,The park is very near the city (to the south) and you can easily reach it with the bus. There are many paths and trails leading to different temples and peaks. There is also a cable car which takes you to the Apsan Mountain.The view of the city is nice and in the summer it is a bit less hot up there. It is a nice green getaway.
Walking in Apsan Park,Great place to go for either an easy stroll or fairly intense climb if you decide to hike up the mountain. Well maintained paths and spectacular views from the top. Cable car also available for less fit. Well worth a visit. 
My favorite place in Daegu,I enjoyed the city view from the top. Beautiful tracks and fresh air. There are lots of cool places under the mountain as well. (apsan cafe street and apsan food trail)
Beautiful park ,What a wonderful area. Very well maintained and open. The paths offer great views at the top. Stairs at the top are awful though
Strenuous uphill hike to see an incredible view,"My husband and I hiked to the peak of Mt. Apsan on a beautifully clear April morning. It was a strenuous hour up and then we hiked down to the observatory, back to the peak and then down. The park is incredibly beautiful. You hike along tumbling streams and waterfalls and while we were there the azaleas were in bloom and we could see many varieties of birds. When we got to the top the view of Daegu below made us forget our stiff calf muscles! There are three peaks and when we return to Daegu we will hike a different one. "
Great leisure hiking,Apsan is amazing for short leisure hikes. There are multiple trails available from beginners to intermediate and the scenery and views are beautiful.
Take the Cable Car to the top of Apsan,Apsan Mountain has great views over Daegu! You can take a cable car to the top or the one way hike takes about 1 hour. There is even a Korean resturant at the top. But I like the coffee shop at the bottom the best.
Good views of Daegu,"Easy to get to the foot of the mountain on the city tour bus. Then, after a short stroll up through woodland take the cable car to the top. There's a sign on the right to a small temple - do take the short deviation, it's a little haven of peace. At the top of the cable car there are astonishing views of all of Daegu showing the huge extent of it. From the top plenty of marked walks - including to get down rather than take cable car again, but you need time & proper walking shoes. We did this trip on the first sunny/war weekend of approaching Spring and it was crowded so aim for a quieter weekday if you can."
Add to your agenda,Day we visited the cable car was down for service. Hiked the paths and got a good work out. Must be in good shape to visit this site. Steep terrain and lots of walking. Must get to the Buddhist temple and grounds. Also visit the war museum to commemorate the brave people of South Koreas stand to halt Communist advancement during the Korean war. Very moving. 
Nice park and view from the top,Nice and peaceful. Good cable car ride to the top and nice large observation deck to get a stunning view of Daegu.
Hiking!,"My friend and I took a cable car up ... each person was about 9900 won. I had thought there was going to be an observation deck at the top but it only had a Pajeon and Makgeolli restaurant. The top of the restaurant did have an observation deck, though ... but if you come here, be prepare to hike :)"
Korean trip,"We spent a week in Korea- mostly Seoul, with an overnight trip to Daegu. Since we had so little time, we had to choose our activities wisely. We choose to take the bus tour and get off at Apsan Park. We are so glad we did! It was pretty decent hiking- there are some steep inclines and gravelly trails that you can take. I would say most people could get out to the platform, but make sure you have good walking shoes to go on the trails (and you'll want to!)It is lovely to get out in nature AND see this large city in a most picturesque fashion. Lovely cable car with cafes, both at the top and the bottom. One of our favorite spots of our trip. I highly, highly recommend it!"
Autumn colors at Apsan Park,"This is a great way to spend an afternoon. There are many hiking trails, some easy, some challenging. There is also a cable car that will take you up to the top of the mountain to see spectacular city views of Daegu and the surrounding area."
Great Hike,"I went here with a friend. We hiked at a leisurely pace about half way up when we noticed the cable car. For 10000 won a piece, we each got a round trip ticket on the cable car to the top and back. The ride itself was very crowded, as they filled it up cramped, but from the view I could see. It was beautiful. When we reached the top, there was a nice restaurant and a gorgeous view of Daegu. Overall, the home was lovely, peaceful and relaxing. There are plenty of restrooms, food trucks, and cream areas. It can be a family oriented trip, or a couple hike, a hike with friends or solo hike. Anyone can go and the atmosphere feels so warm and welcoming. I absolutely love Apsan Park"
Amazing Views,We spent a day hiking out this mountain and it was great. The walk was challenging and it was great to spend the day.
Sunrise hiking at mt Daedeok,"We hiked with my buddy through Apsan Park both day and night. The first time we went there our route crossed Mt. Apsan and Mt. Daedeok. The thing that might dazzle a hiker is the fact that although it shares the name with the whole park, Mt. Apsan isn't the main destination you should choose. Top of the mountain is occupied by some weather station with restricted areas so you don't get any view from this peak. What I truly recommend is the Mt. Deadeok(several routes cross this peak). It was beautiful both day and night. This peak gives you a great panoramic view of almost the whole city of Daegu. Especially on night this is the place to be, since you get a great view over east Daegu, so you will not miss the sunrise. Its good to test the route during daytime since the routes can be a bit challenging. But not too severe or anything since it was my first hike ever and I overcame it with just a decent shape."
Loved it,It was our first time actually hiking anywhere. Took a metro to the closest station and walked to the park entrance. It was a hot day so a lot of water would've been nice. At the top you can get off the trail and just relax on some rocks with an amazing view. We spent around 6 hours there and it was worth every step and every minute. Absolutely going back in oct-nov when the trees change color. There are a lot of paths for different needs so it's suitable for everyone. The climb was a bit exhausting but it would be easy to take a break every now and then.
good hiking experience..,"Trekking level: thanks to government that they have made it way safe to be called a real trekking but yea definitely some work out.U would live the path with winding streams and trees all the way.Definitely take with you plenty of drinking water and some cookies or fruits. And a special advice u might love to have some mild beer at the peak in the midst of clouds.. Totally safe for children as well. Don't need any trekking gadgets unless you need them for posing/photographor you need them for medical cause.Lastly dont believe on the distances written on the way to mountain.. its far more than what was written. Chances are you may find no one in the path.. Its the safest trek possible so dont have to fear.And yea do trek down to temple and from there down for cable car. Dont miss the cable car in Apsan mountains. Take to and fro tickets.and i tell you its a superb place to see the trees and mountains from top and of course for VIDEOGRAPHY rather than photography.While up from the cable car go on the terrace of the cafe and you will see the city and mountains all in one view,,, Take a Panaromic..overall enjoy"
Great,"Beautiful view, great hiking, parking might be a problem. Also, as an FYI if you decide to go hiking Spa World is really close. So you can get a good soak in afterwards. Enjoy."
Regular hiking ,Apsan is a fantastic mountain to get your daily exercise on. There are so many trails and options. Very convenient and accessible for those who live nearby. 
what a hike,I walked up to the cable car to take me up the mountain to the observatory needles to say I still had to hike a little ways. I was not prepared for that at all but I made it and it was awesome the view of the city was fantastic
Epic View!,"We rode the Cable Car up to the top and go some incredible footage of the entire city. If you go to Taegu, you cant tell how large and crowded this city is until you look at it from here. Absolutely stunning."
Great work out with stellar views,I would not recommend the full hike unless you are in decent shape. You can hire someone to take you to the top but that is cheating. You are rewarded with a great view of Taegu when you reach the summit. it is disheartening to see the elderly Koreans pass you without breaking a sweat but I think they do this quite often.
Nice City View,"You can view the Daegu city from many spots at the mountain. If you like hiking, I recommend this place. So many routes to get to the top. You can also ride the cable car.It's not far from the city."
Great Daegu Hiking,"I've hiked mountains all over Korea and I have to say that I really enjoyed my time hiking Apsan. The courses were fun and challenging? But doable for all skill levels. Great for a temple viewing, exercise, picnic, and nature. There is a parking lot for those with cards and a tram for those in need of some assistance or who have families with children. Offers great views of Daegu!"
Great trails! ,"I currently live in Daegu and I absolutely love Apsan Mountain! It has a beautiful scenery and many different routes to get to the top. The terrain changes about every couple of miles so definitely have to be careful but once you get to the top it is soo worth it! You can see all of Daegu and they also have a cable cart that comes down from the mountain just in case you don't want to walk back down. My friend and I walked about 8 miles up and took the cable car down for 9,000 won! Love the trails and will definitely be doing it again. "
Challenging,"Such a pretty view of the city! we did this by ourselves and then with my company as a physical activity. Gotta admit we got lost on the way down the second time but even then it was so much fun. we just followed a type of trail down and the sound of the temples and made it to the museum that is at the beginning of the trails. the glass overview is so pretty, kind of scary but amazing views. the museums and temples are so pretty too and so much information on the history and the place"
Beautiful Trails and Vistas,"This is a local favorite for good reason. The trails and vistas are beautiful. If you don't have time or the energy, a cable car is available to take you to some of the best views of Daegu. If you found this review useful, please click the helpful button."
Frequent Visits,I have been to Apsan mountain on many occasions. I love the peacefulness. It has a wondeeful view. It is best to go before the rainy season in July. 
Stunning view of the city!,"No trip to Daegu is complete without a pilgrimage to the top of Apsan, the largest of the mountains that surround Daegu. Take the cable car to the top, enjoy the view and even have snakes or a meal at the little cafe on top! Or, for those in search of a real adventure, hike the trails to the summit! Don't miss this experience."
Girls trip hike!,Great fun hike! Uphill!!! Major incline! The elderly will pass you. They don't even look strained. Then they stop at the little exercise parks on the way up and exercise more!! We hiked further than we planned but the experience and gorgeous view was well worth the time and sweat. 
"Friendly hikers, cool temples","Very nice old people are always walking up and down through these hills. Clean, well maintained, nice ridge views await at the top. Air quality was ok."
Beautiful view ,"I bought the hop on hop off bus ticket and go off from station #10 for the apsan observatory, it's 10 minutes walk from the cable car station and from there we can buy the return cable car ticket, with my hop off and hop on bus ticket I got 20% off.Cable car runs every 10 mins and it takes almost 2 minutes up. Can be scary if it's on a windy day!From the cable car station to the observation it's a 5 mins walk to the outlook platform. Beautiful panoramic view of the daegu city. There is also a restaurant up there but they have really limited selection of food and drinks."
School field trip,Cherry blossoms were in full bloom and beautiful. A nice museum with auditorium but only in Hangul. The trolley ride offers a great view of Daegu and you can continue to the peak where a temple is located. A good destination to learn some Korean history. 
Good for hiking,"Nice to walk, but be prepared to hike up the mountain for over an hour, or take the cable car :) From the top you can walk several routes to the base of the mountain in about 1-1.5 hour :)There is a bus that runs to the city for 1100 Won "
Nice view point ,"In my opinion, here is the best place for seeing overall of daegu. And you could use the cable car or hiking."
Great view ,"Finding the cable car is not so easy when you don't have a car. Getting to the lower station is rather easy and the price for the ride is affordable. You will habe a great view from the to opt the Apsan down on Daegu and it's surrounding. No matter if you go there by day or night, the view is breathtaking. If you want to hike to the peak assure some 2,5h of time. If you only want to have a nice view, half an hour is enough. "
Superb views of Daegu City!,Great views of the city. Took the cable car up and had a delicious lunch at the top. The walk down is quite steep so should've bought the return ticket for the cable car down. 
Great place to visit,This was great fun to visit. Easy way up the mountain by cable car.Nice restaurant on top with spectacular views. Beautiful scenery all around and hiking trails. Really worth a visit.
Great views,Great view of Daegu. Take the Cable Car or it is a very steep hike. Nice place to have a light meal at the top of the hill.
Beautiful View,This was already way to start the day. There are plenty of places for stopping and resting as you make the hike. We lucked out and came on a cool day. The trails are wide and rocky. You know you're near the top once you reach the stairs. The view made this well worth the climb. Can't wait to do it again! 
I wish I knew about the cable car before the hike,"My husband decided my first day in this area should be hiking up a mountain to the very peak. Really?!! The scenery was very beautiful all throughout the entire mountain from the very bottom to the top. We got to see an ancient Buddha temple with people worshiping. There was a beautiful stream right next to the temple with fresh water that poured into a fountain so people can drink from it (there were little pots there to use). I drank some and here I am a few days later still breathing and no diarrhea so it was okay. There was even a little public workout area with machines where many of the older Koreans were working out. The trail was worn in certain areas and incredibly steep (in certain areas it seemed to be about a 75 degree incline), particularly after we passed the Buddha temple. My struggle to get all the way on top was real. I complained the entire time especially after we passed the temple. The only reason why I didn't stop completely and turn all the way back is because of the 4 older women (age range 58-69) who were trailing me the entire time. My pride would not allow them to pass me. Once we finally got to the top and as I was enjoying the breathtaking view of the city in the observatory area, I noticed a pregnant lady next to me. I said to my husband ""wow, I can't believe she did that hike. That is dangerous"". He then precedes to tell me, "" they probably took the cable car up."" Are you kidding me?!!! He waits to tell me about a cable car after I got all the way up here. Really?!!. You are fired husband! Once I got over the shock I sat down on a bench and this older Korean man comes up to my husband and I and offers us some roasted corn on the cob ( I believe him and his wife had too much). Being a New York City native and not liking to deal with strangers, at first I said no. Then my husband told me it was okay that this is frequently done, I took it and ate it. It was actually really good. We sat and conversed through broken English and Korean for a few moments before we parted ways. We started our way back down and since I wasn't complaining as much I was able to pay attention to more of what was going on around me. The majority of the people climbing the mountain were older Koreans, with very few young people. I did see many kids hiking all below the age of 8. About 90% of the people we encountered gave us a warm greeting as we went up and down the mountain. I even had 2 women come up to me just to say hello and stare at me. But then again I do stand out in this environment as a dark skin tall black woman with a buzz cut. It was a once in a life experience that I won't do again, but was worth all the soreness I experienced the next day."
Mt. Apsan/Nakdong River Battle Museum,"A nice park! The River Battle Museum at the bottom of the mountain was quite fun, though none of the displays were in English! Didn't take the cable car ride but my friends did and they said that the view was amazing!"
Really nice place to visit.,I recommend to climb this mountain. And recommend to board cable car when you finished to feel this mountain. You may meet this picture if youbegin to climb from daedeok restaurant.
Very very foggy on a rainy day,"Light drizzle for the whole day and we sorta knew it would be too foggy to see anything but we went up anw as we only had a day in Daegu. Took metro to Anjirang Station and took bus 410-1 to the last stop. There are LED screens to indicate what stop you are at in English. Bought a round trip cable car ticket at 9k won each and went up. As expected, we were engulfed in fog at the observation deck and could not see anything. When heading back to Anjirang you gotta take 410 (not 410-1 as it loops) and get off at Anjirang junction. "
Great views with little else,"This is a must to see a great view of the City from high up. Reasonably priced. Once up You get there after the view is over there is little else to do. The walk up to the highest point is rough terrain, you must stay alert. Good exercise and enjoy the outdoors on this one. Little kids and elderly need to be aware if you want to walk up to the top"
The Great Outdoors!,I live at the base of Apsan Mountain. I visit this area often and walk my dogs here. Love the hiking trails. They're well maintained and have lights on parts of the trail in case you want to do a little night time hiking. It's not unusual to see people going UP the mountain 9-10 PM.
Gorgeous Nature,Apsan is an easy hike with beautiful views of Daegu. It a perfect place to watch the sunset and come down in the dark along the lamplit trails and temples full of candles and chants.
awesome place of silence,"Went there by taxi, not by bus. (but there are many going there)Bought 1-way ticket for the cablecar uphill.Walked around at the path there to some ""tops"" - than back to the observatory platform which offers a fantastic view.After that walking down to a very small temple and from there finally down back to the noisy city.Definately recommended to wear hiking shoes and clothes - not a must, but it will help.Unfortunately I had no more time than aprox. 3 hours. You can spend easily much more to struggle around there in the woods.Definately a place I will visit again if I will come back to Daegu.The view at night must be amazing, you can see the whole city!"
"Great views, and easy to get to","We went to this today as a result of reading about it on Trip Advisor. It was very easy to get to from reading another poster's comprehensive journey details by metro and bus.Cable Car was quick and economical and we did a bit of walking around at the top.It was pretty quiet, but I can imagine during the high season or at weekends its packed!"
Worth a visit,"Unfortunately when we visited it was quite hazy so the view of Daegu wasn't great, however it was still worth a visit as you get a great view of the city and an idea of just how vast it is. Great walking trails at the top.We followed the directions posted on TA regarding how to get there and it was very easy - metro line 1 to Anjirang, exit 4 (in the metro station the signs tell you to follow exit 3, don't do this as you will end up on the wrong side of the road). The nearest bus stop to the exit is where you take bus 410-1, it is 900w each. Get off at the last stop - this is obvious as it is like a small bus station. Walk up the hill to the cable car station - 9000w each return. For your retuen journey take the bus 410 (not 410-1), there is a digital display in English for each stop.Would recommend!"
Legs of steel,Absolutely love this park. Mountain views from below and gorgeous city views from atop the observation deck. I see why the people of Daegu are always wearing hiking pants...its a lovely place to get a good hike. just don't get stuck up at the observatory after hours...it a long bumpy stroll down the mountainside. The residents may be use to it. But i surely wasn't.
Beautiful mountain park,"Apsan is a beautiful mountain park. There are hundreds of hiking trails, most go up the side of the mountain, but there is one that goes around the base of the mountain that is really nice, too. There are workout areas along the trails up the mountain, as if climbing a mountain is not enough exercise! You can also take a tram to the top, and then walk out to an overlook that gives an awesome view of Daegu (on a clear day). The Korean people love Apsan Park and on any given day there will be hundreds of them there. There are some areas that feel a little crowded, but other areas where you can be pretty much alone."
Best view of Daegu,Daegu is a beautiful city with magnificent mountains and extraordinary views. Apsan Park is both for the adventurer and the casual explorer. You can climb to the top of the mountain; or take the cable car. The view is amazing; and one truly gets an amazing perspective of Daegu when standing there. 
Beautiful,Went up there and saw a great view of Daegu. The cable car was fun and the walk was great. I have taken friends up there to see all of Daegu.
get a nice view of the city,"Apsan Park is always a favorite place for me to visit. Not so far from the town. You can go for mountain climbing or spend some time with your family and loved ones. Good parking facility is available. In hot summer, this place becomes very crowded as water is flowing through a small canal from the mountain. You can to the top of the mountain by climbing or by cable car. I chose the easy one... After getting down the cable car you can go either right or left side. If you go right, then you have to go little further from where you will reach a spot where you can see the beautiful view of the city and river. If you go left after getting down from cable car, you have to go more distances to reach the top , but you will find some nice places to relax. There is also a museum which has military things like plane, tank etc."
Great spot for a nature lover!,"I followed the advice from a previous reviewer and took exit 4 from the Anjirang station on line 1, then took bus 410-1 to get to the park rather than follow the tourist website instructions that are incorrect. I was on my own was grateful to be spared the confusion. It was 900W for the bus ride to the park from the station and while no change is available a 1000W bill is still a great value. The upcoming buses were displayed with a time estimate of their next arrival. The 410-1 buses came by fairly frequently. The stop at the park is at the end of the line. I took the 410 bus for the return to the station. Anjirang station is not listed on the map in English, but is indicated by the subway station icon. Make sure to push the button prior to the stop so that the driver will know that you want to exit. There are maps printed overhead on the bus and the upcoming station is displayed on an electric board at the front of the bus as well as announced. From the bus I followed the paved path uphill to the cable car station. A park office was located half way with a sign that said, ""tourist map"". I was given a little book with pictures and descriptions in Korean and it had a handy fold out map in the back. The downstairs cable car ticket office was not open, but there was a banner in Korean that had an arrow that pointed to the stairs. There was a ticket booth up the stairs at the boarding area, 9000W for a round trip ticket. From the top of the station you can exit to the right and go to the observation deck for a great view of Daegu. The exit to the left leads to the trails. There is a small snack shop near the cable car exit. After going to the observation deck, I hiked the few km to Mt Sanseong before returning to the cable car. The trails are nice and offer great views. I crossed paths with many very friendly hikers and could tell that they really appreciated me saying, ""an-nyong ha-se-yo"", even more so if they spoke first with a ""hello"". I wish that I had had more time to explore more trails."
Lots of trails and a glorious view,"Apsan Park is a great place to explore a little bit of Korean mountains while still being a bus ride away from the city centre. It's beautiful, and the views are spectacular! My only complaint is that it's a bit crowded, but that's to be expected."
Apsan park is one of beautiful place at Daegu. So wonderful. ..amazing scenery ¤¤¤¤¤,Satisfied sightseeing. .....Sport & recreation. ...Good place for refresh my mind. ....I will be back sometime. ..
Sunrise hike,"While I still have four months in Daegu, I am starting to diligently cross off bucket list items. The next three weekends are filled with hiking, music festival and an island getaway trip. Conquering a sunrise hike was a top item on my Korean Bucket List, so this morning I forced myself out of bed before 3:30 a.m. and prepared for a quick trek up Apsan (앞산). 산 is pronounced “san” and means mountain in Korean. This upcoming weekend I am headed to to a mountain on the northeast coast called Seoraksan (설악산), again “san” is mountain.Regardless of the fact that my coworkers bailed, I was determined to conquer Apsan this morning. So, I cooked up some quick eggs and coffee and was out the door. I grabbed a 6,500₩ ($6.30) taxi to Sangdong Bridge at the base of mountain closest to my apartment. At the bridge, I asked the taxi driver to turn left and then a quick right. Then, I was where I wanted. The taxi driver had been talking my ear off the whole ride—some English but mostly Korean. “America! Good!” he repeated. Thanks man. He even shook my hand when I exited the cab—this is not normal behavior.I was at the base of the mountain at 4:27 a.m. With some pep in my step, I made it to a point to take this photo by 4:55 a.m. The sun was meant to rise at 5:15 a.m. So, I climbed another 10 minutes and was able to get some amazing shoots despite the heavy heavy smog. Daegu sits in a valley so humidity and smog seem to stick around longer than I’d like. This morning was an especially smoggy one with a ungodly amount of yellow dust. On my way up, I only ran across to ajummas (Korean women of a certain age). They were friendly with large welcoming smiles as I passed. On the way down, there were many friendly exchanges. Numerous ajusshi (literally means “uncle” but is used for older Korean men similar to “sir”) were listening to small handheld radios. I couldn’t help but think about my dear Grandpa Jim, who always had the radio on in his shop."
Apsan Observation Platform (앞산 전망대),"If you've looked south on a clear night in Daegu, you may have noticed a bright square hovering high in the distance. That's the Apsan Observation Platform (앞산 전망대). To get to the platform I recommend Anjirang Sports Park (안지랑 골체육 공원), a smaller park that's separate and farther west from the main Apsan Park. Copy and paste these coordinates into Google Maps: 35.830427, 128.573329 or if you prefer NaverMaps for directions copy and paste this: 대덕식당If you're going to drive your own car, there is a small parking lot at the parks entrance or you can park along the main road. I usually park on the north side of the overpass which is a restaurant area known as 대덕식당 ""Daeduck Restaurant"". If your going by cab tell the driver you want to go to ""dae-duck shick-dhang"" (대덕식당). As you walk under the overpass if you see a guy selling mountain climbing gear you know you are in the right spot. Simply cross the street and you should see the trail-head with two paths; you can take either path to get started."
Breathtaking views of the city.,"A short cable car ride to a mountain ridge gives stunning views over the mega city of Daegu! We had a few minutes of fun trying to recognise different parts of the city.It was a bit disconcerting to have music broadcast through loudspeakers while on the mountain; but this is Korea after all.For a city of such a size there aren't a very great deal of 'things to do' but I can recommend this as a short breath of fresh air.We arrived by taxi and found, on departure, that a very short walk out of the park took us to a good taxi hailing spot."
Stenuous climb but nice views.,"My wife and I went to Apsan last Monday (March 10, 2014). The directions on the Korean Tourism web site were not quite correct so we started going in the wrong direction when we took the subway to Anjirang station, took exit 3, then got on the 410 bus at the nearby bus stop. We soon discovered that the bus was travelling away from Apsan (although it would have eventually arrived there about an hour later, I think). We got off that bus and caught a 410-1 which took us to the park. Rather than taking Exit 3 from the station (as the Visit Korea web site says) we should have taken Exit 4 and caught the 410-1 bus to Apsan Park. On our arrival at the park we walked up the 500m or so to the Cable Car station hoping to take a ride up the mountain but found they are doing major maintenance on it and it was closed. The cable car building was surrounded in scaffolding and a large banner attached to the scaffold (all in Korean apart from the dates) seemed to suggest to me that the cable car may be closed until the end of April (although as I don't speak Korean, that's a guess on my part). So we began the ascent on foot. It is quite a strenuous climb, in fact it was a bit too strenuous for my wife. As I was keen to try and capture some panoramic views with my camera on one of the few clear days, I continued up the hill alone. It took me nearly 90 minutes to reach the summit going quite quickly (having to pause frequently to catch my breath - I am reasonably fit but I was trying to hurry). The views from the top were quite good. See photos. It then took me another hour to make the descent back to the Cable Car station where my wife rejoined me. We caught the 410-1 back to the city but it took a very long, circular route. I suspect it would have been quicker to take the 410 as these buses seem to go in opposite directions around roughly the same route. The park is very large and one could easily spend many days exploring it. Try and choose a smog free day if you want to get decent panoramic photographs."
Beautiful!,"This is a very large park but beautiful and not too difficult if you've never gone up a mountain before. My husband and I walked up Mt. Apsan, stopped for lunch half way and took the cable car down. It was a full day trip for us, and there is plenty to see. There are some truly wonderful views and a nice landscape of Daegu. "
"Amazing views of the City, less crowded than Polgansan","It took us an hour and a half to climb the mountain but the views at the top were breathtaking (quite literally since I'm only in average shape, this isn't the easiest mountian to climb). We were tired so we took the cable car down but if you want you can take the cable car up as well. Beware that the signs on the trail aren't very helpful and often you'll be sort of lost wondering if you're going the right way but it is a beautiful mountain."
Beautiful Area for walking,Daegu is fortunate to have this jewel located on the edge of the city. Easy to take a bus to get there. Along the walk to the cable car is a picturesque temple. Take the time to walk up the steps to see the painted dragons inside the overhang. There is also a museum along the way. We went on a Fall weekday and there were very few people and no wait for the cable car to top of mountain. Take the cable car for great views of the city.
