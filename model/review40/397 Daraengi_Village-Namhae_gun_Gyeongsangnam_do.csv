A hidden gem,"This definitely worth a visit. We had dinner at one of the restaurants (only discovering later that there were more choices, but we were happy where we were) and then strolled through the town and down to the water. Surprises and delights at every turn!"
Wide and green landscape,A wide and green place near the sea with a nice landscape. It is famous for terraced rice paddies on a steep hill on the outskirts. You can experience farming and making maquettes of the farmer with paper there.
Quaint and refreshing village,"Namhae in my opinion is really a good place to unwind, destress & take a refreshing walk cuz of the interesting agricultural scenery as well as the stunning seashore especially in Daraengi Village. We went there with a group & tried some activities. As i walk down beside the rice paddies terraces..the road was steep but so safe & there were restaurants & many guesthouses in the area. The village also has a perfect view of the sea."
A peaceful Village,"If you want to escape from the crowded city, just come to this village. you will feel a peaceful here. The combination of mountain, sea, and farming here will make you forget the problems in city."
Daraengi Rice Paddy,"I wonder about the famous Korean villages? Here's one of them! The village is near the town of Namhae, called Daraengi. And it is famous for its rice fields, many people know that rice here in Korea is eaten like bread? So rice is grown here for almost all of Korea. And what is very interesting, in the spring there is a festival of flowering rice Daraengi Rice Paddy! The festival offers many interesting programs that allow visitors to experience traditional Korean agriculture and explore the cultural and natural heritage of Darenga Village such as: field furrowing, Korean wrestling, rice planting, running with rice cushions and much more. And also we tried to build a cow and shepherd from paper, who work in the field. I think for children it will be very exciting. "
Darengi village,"It is a small place with an amazing beach view. We had a doll making experience. It was one of kind to have. This place is good for couples, family, even for kids to have a fun activity. The greenery around village was a treat to eyes"
Highly recommended,A small but extremely beautiful village. The village consists of colorful roofs and terraced fields. The overall look of the village is superb. Must walk down to the village and discover the combination of beautiful sea and cliff. It is a perfect place for photography.
Namhae must visit,"We visited this place on a very very very rainy day so we could not do outdoors farming activities and stayed inside to make dolls, very cute. The vibe was perfect, everywhere was green, the air clean, you can see the sea faraway, the host were super helpful even though he does not speak English. Cannot miss this place when you visit Namhae. Very good. Very fun. Much fun. Namhae is very fun. 90% of visitors are foreigners, so no worries."
A nice break during coastal drive - amazing views,"The village is in a lovely location. If i am honest the village wasn't too special, though it did offer great views, and just a chance to see something different. But i would recommend coming here just for the coastal drive that you'll do to get there. We saw absolutely stunning views during the drive, and for that alone it is worth it. Then the decision to stop or not in the village is yours... Great views."
Package tour,"I went this place through Adventure Korea. Daraengi Village was part of the tour and it was a just ordinary place you can see in South Korea. The difference is it is kind of stair rice paddy field, which was nothing special. The tour included sea fishing and sea kayaking. The sea fishing was expensive. The sea kayaking was awful because we saw some fish while we were doing kayaking. The organiser should have known this and should have taken us to elsewhere instead. It was disgusting to see so many dead fish. The guest house was in terrible condition with bad smell in room. Overall, Adventure Korea's organisation skills are inferior and the tour was terrible.Namhae ocean itself was beautiful though."
To crowded and hard to park,No parking lot for tourist.No information for place.The food is bad and costy.I would not recommend this place.
Nice view,"We pay a short visit in daraengi, we spent an hour walked around this place. The weather is super hot but it is worth to visit. It has a nice ocean view."
Nothing special...,Just drive by and you will see everything. Dont try to drive into the village. The rads are very narrow and steep. 
Sightseeing around Namhae,A really interesting terraced village where they grow and sell onions. Good parking at the roadside and the usual conveniences as always found in Korea. A steep walk down to the sea cliffs and great views of the mountains.
What attraction ?,Perhaps my eyes were spoiled by terrace field of sacred valley of Cuzco or beautiful countryside view of Vietnam. It was ordinary view along seaside load. I don't see any point of stopping here as there is nothing to see or experience. Unless you have relatives and must visit here it is not worth to add this place in your itinerary.
Gacheon Terraced Village,"This is a tiny village with terraced fileld on a hill. At the hilltop, you can see colorful roofs and terraced fields. At the bottom, there is the sea with beautiful cliff. Lots of photographers come here to take pictures of this terraced fields."
Better when it's not crowded,"If you've ever visited in Bali, you feel that this place is similar to that. Very nice veiw of rice fields along the ocean and cliffs, beautiful tracking paths! When you relaxe on bench on the cliif, you feel free and rest.."
worth a visit.,"you will meet layered narrow rice-field on a cliff of the south sea of korea(just like the ones in south east asia, i don't know what to call it). if you happen to visit namhae or yeosu area , it's worth to pay a visit here as well."
a hidden jem in Namahae,The Island of Namahae is one of the best places in South of Korea to explore both beach and forest. The drive to Daerangi village will bring you along the coastline and gives you an amazing view of the ocean. The village has great combination of rice terraces and a perfect view of the ocean. You can see the farmers working on their field. 
Traditional agricultural village,"An interesting agricultural village set on the side of a very steep hill facing a beautiful bay. The rice fields in September are gorgeous and about to be harvested. We came in mid week in off peak season, but normally there are many activities to participate in. "
Beautiful landscape ,"Beautiful place for a walk and wnjoying the view.The First day we stop by was cloudy and we decided to come next day as we were staying near by.Definitely a must see spot in Nam Hae, specially if the weather is sunny."
Gacheon Daerengi maeul,"Daraengi maeul has been selected by CNN as one of the best Korean travel places. The field of Gacheon Village on the sightseeing road of southern coast is a popular driving course in Namhae. There is also a narrow and long stairs type rice paddy cultivated from a steep mountain slope, which faces the blue sea.The pavillon is built on the village where it is a great place to rest and find comfort on a hot summer day"
beautiful small town.,it has a great ocean view from the village. you can walk along the side of a hill feeling the breeze from the ocean.
