Nice trek with some historic views,"We decided to make healthy trekking and we did not know that there is also a fortress. The fortress itself was not impressing, but the long wall (kind of low Chinese great wall) was interesting to see! We run out of the water and there is no place to buy it - but local well helped us!"
Just a fortress remain,"Watch from a distance. Just a fortress remain and if you don't read about ti before visiting, it will be easily ignored. "
The Fortress itself is not the real site to been seen here,"So, honestly, the Fortress is just a big 'ol wall with trees and weeds growing around it. It is not why you should go, but you should go. There is a cable car up if you need it, but I recommend hiking up. The hike is about an hour and it doesn't require a moderate level of fitness but the best views are from the hike, not the view at the top of the cable car. Also, from the Fortress you can continue a short hike to Seokbulsa temple. Follow the signs for Namman village, it is the only other road leading from the Fortress Gate opposite direction as the cable car. Go through the village and take the trail to the left heading up into the forest. It will take you to a long set of stairs heading down. The path will eventually come out at a road. Go right up hill along the road. Bit of a steep trek but at the top is Seokbulsa Temple and the beautiful stone carvings hidden behind the temple. You can either backtrack to the cable car or continue down the road and work your way to the metro (bit of a walk, Naver would be helpful here)."
We took the lazy option. Thoroughly enjoyable,"We got the cable car, having walked from Oncheonjang station to the 'ropeway' station. The signs aren't great but we were using satnav so it was fine. The cablecar itself looks like it's from the 60s (in a good way- vintage rather than unsafe) with great views of the city as you go up. We were there on a Wednesday and it was pretty empty. Once at the top there were a number of walkers and we followed signs through the woodland to the south gate of the fortress. It was nice to see and lovely woods. If we'd had longer it would have been good to do a more challenging walk to one of the other gates or temples nearby."
Korean rocky road,"Took metro red line 1 to Beomeosa. At Exit 7 road level, immediately u-turn and take 1st right and walk up a small road to bus stop 90 (big letters which one can't miss) - it's the only bus which goes to Beomeosa Temple. Unfortunately I read some blogs which didn't mention this precious detail and cost us 45 mins of aimless wandering and sweating. After asking a few shops, we found this bus 90. Devil is in the details.The bus stopped at the temple entrance. We walked up the road and came to temple entrance. Continued to walk to back of temple (parking for temple stay) and started our hike to North Gate. The terrain was akin to a river of rocks, I kid you not. Fortunately we all had proper hiking shoes and most of us had hiking sticks. About 1.7km later, we reached North Gate - basically just an entrance with a wall running up and down. We had a choice to turn left and go towards East Gate and then to South Gate, else turn right for Godangbong Peak (1km). We all voted for the peak cos we wanted to have our picnic lunch at the peak. After more trudging up staircases and slopes for 30~40 mins, we hit the peak and were greeted by 3 cats - go figure. Scenery was a million bucks; egg and luncheon meat sandwiches with apples and pears tasted all the sweeter. After a photo session, we made our way back to North Gate and retraced our route to Beomeosa Temple. Bus 90 back to town - don't miss it cos the next one comes every 20ish minutes."
North Gate from Beomeosa Temple,"I saw on the map that it was close to the Temple so though I would kill two birds with one stone. The trail up to the North gate from the temple is well marked and even has ropes to keep you on the track. BUT the track is steep, and in places very steep and you are stepping up rough stones that have been laid in a pathway, which is challenging for the legs. Took me just under the hour to get to the north gate and then another 30 minutes to make it to the peak of Mt Geumjeogsan for some big views, again well formed path with steps in the steep bits. By the time I had done this I was pooped, so headed back down the temple rather than heading out towards the other gates."
If you like walking in nature,"Well , we have begin the fortress n'y the South Gare, with the ropeway which gives a nice view on the Busan Bay. I recommand if you want to go to the North gate 3 things : water, compass to follow the North and the Korean map ( the english Map is useless because the ways are in koreans). If you have this 3 things it is a very Nice travel not really difficult and you CAN sometimes walk on the remparts ( East Gate) and have really Nice view on the Town or the Mountains ( near the North Gate). Métro to métro it is a 12 kilomètres walking .. about 4 - 5 Hours. "
Great fortress,"Great fortress.West, East, South gate are easy to access.North gate is to approach from other gate or Bomosa.Anyway each gate is worth visiting."
An interesting place to visit: Good exercise!,"We travelled up the cable car, expecting to be at the top, but in fact there was a long walk from where the cable car stopped. It was light bushland with a reasonably good series of tracks and plenty of signage.An enjoyable outing with good exercise!"
Ethereal Woods and Great Views BUT maps poor,We took the cable car and walked to South Gate. Then visited the 'Observatory' about the cable car station. Splendid old woods with reasonable trails having an almost 'Lord of the Rings' feel. Great views.Two ways in which the experience could be improved1) Better maps2) Cutting back the trees around the Observatory so one can fully see its splendid view.
Nice hike to the fortress,Good hike from the cable car station towards Geumjung fortress and onwards to the temple. Recommended.
Nice walk,"We had a great day here, the scenery and nature is beautiful. However: make sure to follow the walls, as the area in the middle of the fortress is rather boring. Viewpoint north to the fortress is worth a stop if you have the time!"
Beautiful mountain park and quiet respite from the city,The Geumjeongsan Mountain area has moderate walk trails around the perimeter to the different fortress gates and through the centre of the park. Plan on at least a half day or more to see different parts of the area and to enjoy forest trees. There are fresh water springs (with drinking cups) in different parts of the park and the cable car ride down provides a wonderful view of the city far below. 
Amazing mountain top fortress that is too big to see in one trip,"I had extra time during a business trip and the company I was visiting took me here. The fortress is huge, so there are many ways to get there, but our trip up the mountain was a great car ride. They took us to the East Gate. We parked a couple hundred years from the gate and walked up the hill to the gate. There is no admission fee, and if you were so inclined you could walk, or perhaps even mountain bike along wall of the fortress many kilometers. The view from the wall is terrific. The visit at the gate is a great photo spot, but there is not a lot of historic information at the site. I think it is great for a quite visit like ours, or as a point to start out on an extended hike along the wall."
Great trail run,"I had such a blast running around this area on a quiet weekday. The views are excellent and the trails are great fun. Keep a note of the Korean symbols for where you want to go, as almost no signposts have English text."
Wonderful hiking ,"You can take taxi, it's not expensive, specially if you're several people. We showed the taxi driver the address we found in Trip Advisor (in Korean language) and he understood this immediately. We started from Beomeosa temple and walked to North gate. If you take to the left from North gate will you come to East gate, then south gate. You can take the cable car from South gate. It's a beautiful hiking, maybe a little bit hard for some people. Remember to bring water and food. "
Great Hike,"Went through these trails with my boyfriend and our friend. We have a bad habit of leap frogging with each other and ended up marching pretty fast up to the top of the peak, so it was exhausting! But the view was stunning."
Great hike,"Great hike but can be demanding. Options for short or long hike. The signs are all in Korean only. It will be best to take a photo of the map and the foot of the mountain and then do a little ""matching"" to find your way. You may include Beomosa temple in your route."
Great hike and views,"The fortress itself is not that impressive, but the best is to add Beomeosa temple to your visit. Actually the best is to start from Beomeosa Temple, go through the Sea of rocks (a quite hard hike for 2km), and then reach the peak of Geumjungsan. Then you can go down and follow the way along the fortress wall, and enjoy many view points on your way down. You will reach Namun gate and village, with expensive food, and then you can try to find Seokbulsa temple, which is really worth it. Great hike but you should start early morning if you wanna enjoy everything."
Great hiking experience,"Its an amazing hike with beautiful views and variety of routes to chose from. It gets bit tricky with lack of clear markings in English, but manageable with some basic orientation skills. Hiking can be divided into stages and extended from couple of hours to full day long 20km trek. Take a subway Beomeosa temple and start from North gate towards East and than South gate - or few stations earlier and do the opposite direction. You may also close the loop with some 20km hike."
"Walkers, go!","Great to walk around, but you need tipo be in good condition. Have a good map ready - most signs are in Korean! "
easy hike,"you can go to a 801m high mountain in easy 3 or 4 hours walk.Cross some gates...They do have signs in English, but they are not enough, is easy to get lost once you leave the walls... and they didn't have treakking maps..."
Lovely for hiking and a charming temple,"I took the cable car up and walked to the South Gate (up and to the left) - nothing to write home about, but returning to the cable car area I noticed a small sign to a temple. Itss about a block or two distance to the right of the cable car station (facing up hill) and it proved to be quite charming - a small temple with rock carvings and a Buddha statue above. "
A stoned wall,"This is the place to do hiking. There are many trails and while we were there, young and old were hiking. We started our trail by taking the cable car inside Geumgang Park, a round trip ticket costs 8000won. After we got down from the cable car, we headed to Nammun, South Gate. We saw a gate with a 200m wall on both sides and flag posts with flags flapping along side the wall. There are sitting places to relax and rest. Bring along a big container of water. We got to Geumgang Park by taking Line 1 to Oncheonjang, exit 1. Then walked left towards the overhead pedestrian crosswalk. Crossed the street, walk down the left staircase and turn right at the first corner. Down the street , there's a sign pointing to Geumgang Park. Enjoy your outing"
Nice walk and city view.,"The hike from the temple to the North gate takes 45min and is not this easy.Once at the north gate, the walk to the south gate is breath taking.Best view to the city ever !The 7km hiking trail is easy."
If You Have Time,"Visited here for a brief walk on the walls. Basically skippable, nothing much to see. Nature was nice, though."
Beautiful Scenery of Busan,The fortress itself is an amazing historical site with fortress walls decorating the mountain range. More spectacular is the view on Geumjeong Mointain! You can literally see the city of Busan and other smaller cities / towns surrounding the mountain. You can also view the huge river meandering across the Korean landscape. Truly it was an amazing experience for me. It took us about 30 - 40 mins of leisurely hiking from the Beomeosa Temple to the mountain's peak. Try coming early to the temple to get good parking space.Definitely a worthwhile hike!
excellent hiking with some history,Trails are well marked and it would take 2 full days to do them all. Plenty of nice viewpoints of Busan and you can see the historical gates. Trails are not too difficult unless you go to Seokbulsa Temple (near the fortress).Busan is blessed to have great hiking so close.
We had a wonderful hike,"We met by metro to Oncheonjan Station on Line 1. We crossed the street and took bus #203 to the beginning of the trail to the East Gate of the Geumjeong Fortress. We hiked 1 1/2 hours to a beautiful vista point but did not get to the North Gate or to the Temple. Too far for us but really beautiful. The forest had pines, maples, oaks and lots of lush greenery."
It is all about the journey..,"We visited here after the Beomeosa Temple (see instructions). A 1.6km walk uphill to the first gate - 1hr or so. The gates and wall are interesting but not 'epic'. We loved the walk from gate to gate as the views of the valleys, towns and various building was impressive. Weather was glorious and there were a few walkers (mainly Korean). Signs are in Korean so download a rough map before walking! We took a bus down after walking. We did not get to the south gate. Enjoy the views and pleasant nature walk...."
Bit of a let down,"I was really excited going to the fortress. I walked up from the Beomeosa Temple, which gave some sketchy English directions ( you see some purely Korean signs on the way) which made me hesitant at times (walking up partial downhill streams). It is only about 1.6km up hill, most people take about an hour or 2 but realistically you can get up there in 30 mins or so. Initially the North gate was breath taking and the surrounding walls as well as the watch towers but going further into the area, it has become quite modernised and there is little in terms of English signs or directions - You must take one of those leaflets"
Beautiful walk and lovely view form the north gate,"We walked through Beomeosa temple and walked along a well developed rock pathway to the north gate of the fortress.The signs say that the walk is only 1.6km, however that is very wrong. It took us a good 2 hours to get there, and we don't walk slowly but are a also not super fast. The walkway goes next to and through a beautiful stream. The water is lovely and clean and fresh to paddle in along the way.The fortress wall is a lovely place to stop and have a rest (before the return trip) in the cool breeze, gazing at the views.We were planning on going on the one of the other gates along the wall, but seeing how long the supposed 1.6km took us, we did not trust the distances listed in the Busan map. Definitely worth hoping, but you do need to be relatively fit. "
Really nice!,"If you are going up here, you might as well continue on down to the Seokbulsa Temple, this was our actual final destination. However, I will say this area by the south gate is quite lovely for hiking, there are a lot of trails and a lot of routes to explore. We took the cable car up which was a great experience with awesome views of the city below. If you enjoy hiking this is a great place to explore."
Great experience,"We walked up from Beomeosa Temple to the North Gate, along the walls past the east gate and then descending via cable car from near the South gate. It was a good workout - lots of ups and downs and was around 8km (5 miles). If took us about 4.5hrs including a stop for lunch. Take food, aside from an ice cream seller there was nowhere to buy food after the temple. Beautiful views even though it was quite hazy.Top tip - at one of the multi lingual signs early on take a photo of the Korean for South gate and East gate (and later on for cable car), quite a few of the signs further on are only in Korean and it can be a bit confusing.We had walking shoes but no other special equipment and we didn't need walking sticks or anything like that.When you descend the cable car it's not that obvious how to get from there to Oncheonjang (oncheon) metro - take a map or have maps available on your phone etc.Cable car one way down is W4000 per person."
Huge hiking network,"If you have two days to spare, climb this mountain and traverse all four gates... There are plenty of campsites along the route. The views are amazing! You can use the gondola and reach the south gate in about half an hour for short trips... The oncheonjang station is close to the park entrance. "
Peak of the Grandmother's house,"At 801.5 m it is not very high but it is the highest point at Geumjeongsan. On top here u can see all the smaller peaks below and the fortress wall that runs from north to south. We have went up the other way by cable car the last time we were here in January and hiked to the South gate of the Mt. fortress. By subway train line 1 to Beomeosa station Exit 5, a short wall up to the bus terminal take bus no.90 1300won to reach Beomeosa Temple. At the temple u have two choices of trail, one on your left which is steeper rocky trail 2.8km and the other on your right an much easier trail 3.5 km, come winter day I think the right side trail should be a better choice while the other trail might require u to wear spiked shoe. Whichever trail u choose it should be an easy climb, all the difficult part is taken care of by well constructed wooden stairs. Somehow I think the whole place is more beautiful during sunny winter's day, snow is a feature that makes the landscape stands out. According to the story board the name of the highest peak was only been instated quite recently and they choose to call her Peak of the house of a Grandmother, aptly name, a grandmother could easily have a house here, that's an easy walk home. We went up the left side and came down on the right just like everything else here in Beomeosa it all comes in a loop, the bus runs in a loop, the trail goes around in a loop, the temple itself right in the middle, the buildings seem to go around in a loop too, I guess that makes everything complete. We can actually see the fortress wall running along the mountain ridge at Godangbong here, looks like an tedious up and down route, no trees along the way, 'botak' mountains can see stone walls only and the sun is very hot so we went back down. The last time we came we made a loop at the south side complete with the help of cable car, this time we complete the loop on the north side on foot. Two loops but still not complete yet, I guess I might have to come back the third time to link all the peaks in one go to accomplish the ultimate loop."
Excellent hiking area,"Excellent hiking area, well served and with useful signage. Bring water and dress properly. You can customize the route according to the time availability and hiking difficulty. Be sure to include Beomeosa temple as your starting or ending point."
A Good Refreshing Hike,"I started my hike from Beomeosa Temple (do stop by before your hike and also to use the toilets first).The hike up to the North Gate was about 2km and took me over an hour. It's not a tough hike but you're mostly climbing up rocks so you may move slower. Directions in English are scarce so I would suggest recognizing the Korean characters for ""North Gate"" to avoid getting lost because there are a few junctions that you may come across.When you reach up the North Gate, there are picnic tables for you to rest and eat. There are not food stalls up there so please bring your own food. From the North Gate, either continue walking to the other gates or climb back down, which was what I opted for."
paradaise,i get lost !!! jajajajajaja but the view was amazing ..... i couldnt see it complety because its too big and the weather was not good .... but if u like trecking.... it´s a must !!
"Scenic views, and a long hike","I've hiked along the wall of Geumjung Mt. fortress twice, and both times it's taken longer than I expected. Plan on half a day to do the walk from the South Gate to the North Gate, longer if you want to go up to the mountain at the far north end. There are fantastic views across Nopo-dong and the fortress interior (the 'fortress' itself is an entire valley) to be had from the Northern half of the wall. If you have time, climb the peak at the Northern end of the walk. When I was there the path from the South to the East gate wasn't very well signed and was in pretty poor condition, with some very steep/narrow sections. I'd recommend visiting Beomeosa temple, then hiking the wall from North to South. The East to North gate section is wonderful, but it's a more fun trip if you can get to the South gate for the nearby cable car down before it closes! "
Excellent View at the Mountain Fortress,"There are alot of trails leading up to Geumjung Mt Fortress. One of the easiest way is to take the ropeway which is about 1km walk from Oncheonjang Metro station. It will shorten the journey to the South Gate. We went on 1/1/2013 winter time and although the trail is not strenuous, it is the icy slippery snow on the ground that makes hiking difficult. From the Ropeway station, we walk to the South Gate, then head towards the East Gate. From the East Gate, we hike all the way up to the Mountain Watch Tower, passing through Wonhyobong Peak and then down to Beomeosa Temple trailhead exit.I must say that the view at the Ropeway station or at the South Gate is not that magnificient. The most scenic region of Mt Geumjung is at Fortress Watchtower 4, Euisangbong Peak and Wonhyobong Peak. After these area, there is nothing much to photograph much. The trail leading down to Beomeosa is quite technical as compared from the way of Oncheonjang (heavy snow and ice path). From Beomeosa temple, we walked down about 1km and there is a bus stop with Bus No. 90 going to Beomeosa Temple Metro Station.If hiking/trekking is your thing, it is good to climb this mountain. If photography is your main reason of coming to this mountain, then it would be good to start from the East Gate to head up to the scenic area I mentioned above. Else, the Ropeway would be a good transport to bring you up. Winter hike up Mt Geumjung is harsh with strong freezing wind and slippery ice ground. Bring your walking stick and shoe claws along. Be adequately dressed with proper hiking gears."
Great HIKING and several Rock Climbing options,"Whether you are looking for some pleasant day hikes (in the middle of Busan) or some serious technical rock climbs (there are sport and trad crags, multipitch ridges and bouldering!) this is a nice ""getaway"" in the middle of Korea's second city. The main hiking (on an exposed ridge) can be cold if there's a wind, but there are several trails as options, with nice views, mostly along the old fortress walls (which have been restored) and easy access by public transportation."
Lots of time and trouble to get to the top,"I took a Busan City Tour, and we spent 50 minutes getting up and back and 10 minutes on top. So if you go, you really need to spend more time. All I can report on is the view from the cable car, which I suppose is exciting for some visitors. You can see the whole of Busan spread out below you. But with 10 minutes on top, you won't see anything that's up there. Except it does make you wonder about how the Japanese were able to attack and overwhelm this location during their 16th century invasion. "
Great hiking and beatiful views,"I brought my family there (two kids age 11 and 14) for hiking in October. The weather was very nice and it was around 20-22 degC even though it was in October. We took a taxi from Busan downtown to the Beomeosa Temple. It takes around 30 min and costs KRW 20.000. You can walk up into the temple area and you will easily find the starting point for the hiking trail on the left side. Just follow the signs for the ""temple living"" and there is an exit there. the temple in itself is amazing, so it worth to spend some time there as well. It is a steep walk of about 45 min or around 3 km up to the North Gate. After that you can choose to turn right and up to the Geumjeong Mountain which is 45 more minutes or 1.1 km up to the peek at 801 m. It is really worth it. After that you return to the North Gate and follow the trail towards the South Gate. After about 90-120 min walking you'll reach a new gate. Go through it to the left and hold to the right until you reach the street after 10 min. It is a bus stop there and the buses comes every 10-15 min. It will take you down to the foot of the mountain. Alternatively you could continue towards the south gate and take the cable car down. We did not try that, but we could see it on the map. Bring plenty of water as we did find any places to buy it. Although there are some hills along this trail, our kids really enjoyed the whole trip. i recommend going from Beomeosa as you can enjoy the view towards Busan downtown and the ocean. It is really beatiful. It was fairly easy to find the way and many of the Koreans are eager to help you as well."
"Large, rambling park perfect for city escapes","I enjoy hiking and found Busan's Geumjung Fortress to be a perfect escape from the city bustle. There are many walking paths to choose from, small ponds and forests, as well as convenient facilities like restaurants serving makguksu noodles (welcome on a humid summer day). Take the cable car up or bus it to Beomosa temple first. "
the MUST in Busan !!!,"Wow. it was just a accidentally visit, but the most unforgettable place in my Busan tour.We caught the cable car from the main entrance, wow, while raising up, nice to enjoy a over view of Dongnae Hot Spring ZoneDue to suburb, we kinda lost our way. Had a hard time to get our way to East gate, or South gate, i forgot. The historial fortress, is just like what we used to see. But, this LOST in Geumgang Park, we found the most beautiful cherry blossom!!! Along the unknown path by following other hiking buddies, we have checked out a dream-like heaven!! Lots of local outdoor restaurant built along this path, hikers enjoy food & makkoli under cherry blossom!!But after, I have a great fear about ""PARK"", since this visit of ""PARK"" have taken me 3 hours, with over half of the time, we are lost with our way!!!"
A wonderful half day outing,"This is one of our favourite activities of our recent first visit to South Korea, we started our day by heading to the supermarket after leaving the hotel to stock up on a few supplies for our intended half day of hiking. We caught the subway over to Beomeosa Temple subway station and caught a taxi to Beomeosa Temple, after a brief look around we headed up the mountain to the remains of the Geumjeongsanseong Fortress (built in 1703). It is a rather steep climb, well laid out pathway consisting of large rock/stone stairs to get to the first gate, the North gate, it is 1.6 kms west of Beomeosa Temple. From here along the ridge of the mountain it is easier walking to get to the Eastern Gate, another 2.7 kms of hiking. We have our lunch on the way under the protection of some pine trees from the wind and drizzle, there is a picnic area with table and benches very close to the Eastern Gate as well as toilets. We made our way down to the local road from the mountain to catch a bus back to the subway station, the bus (1800 won each) comes every 15 minutes during and week and more frequently on the weekend and takes you near Oncheonjang subway. We only realise how much walking we have done today when we notice that our return subway journey home is 6 subway stations less. We would love to return to the fortress in the future, hopefully on a clear day."
Great break from shopping and eating!,"We were on a cruise along the southeast asian coast, and this hike was just such a welcome break from the normal touring (walking, shopping eating) that we did at every other port. We weren't exactly sure how to get there, but just took the main subway/train north, and were able to get there with no incident by just looking to the left for the cable car, getting off at a stop that seemed close and just walking toward the mountain (less than a mile, cute walk past shops off the beaten path). I believe we took the southern most entrance to the gate.We were yruly impressed with how much work they were putting into recreating the fortress. It looked like they were using all or most original stones and carefully placing them to make the wall, without any cement. We were definitely happy to support such a cause. I only wish that we had more time to be up there all day exploring."
Delicous food at the end of a relaxing hike.,"We rode the cable car, then went for a hike (it was very easy going) to a small town on the mountain and had a feast of locally grown duck and goat. It was amazing and we really felt like we had earned the lovely meal after the stroll. "
Good day hike along fortress walls,This used to be a large fortress but unfortunately as with many places in Korea it was destroyed during the Japanese occupation. The gates have been restored and you can walk along the fortress walls. It is is easy to get to via the cable car and an entire day can be spent hiking along the fortress walls.
