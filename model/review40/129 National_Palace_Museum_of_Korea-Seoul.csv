Great addition to a visit to Gyeongbokgung,This museum is in the grounds of Gyeonbokgung palace and is a great place to get a bit more understanding about the Joseon dynasties - especially if you didn't have guided tour of the palace. Just the right size to be interesting but not bombard you with too much information.
Informational,Entrance is free and there is audio guide that you can rent at the information desk. It is located within Gyeongbukgung but just outside the ticketing booth. Plenty of displays and descriptions depicting the lives of the royal families who lived in the palaces. Took us an hour to complete though we would love to stay longer.
Great museum,"I arrived at the Gyeongbokgung Palace at 0930hr, too early to witness the changing of royal guards ceremony at 1000hr, Hence I decided to visit this nearby museum first. There are free digital locker to store my backpack. This museum displays royal relics from the Joseon Dynasty. There are many exhibition halls, with each hall displaying exhibits of Kings of the Joseon Dynasty, Joseon Palaces, Royal Court Life, Korean Empire, Astronomy & Science Hall Ⅰ, Royal Court Paintings, Jongmyo, the Royal Ancestral Shrine, Royal Court Music, Royal Procession, Astronomy & Science Hall Ⅱ. After visiting the museum, I have a better understanding of the King’s life during that era. Admission is free with toilet facilities and seats for resting."
Wonderful Historical Museum - on grounds of Gyeonghbokung Palace,"This museum covering several dynasties of Korea is well worth a visit, and well take you 2-3 hours. Beautiful displays of wonderful historical objects. There is a small restaurant on site to take time to relax."
Great museum!,Entrance to the museum is free and audio guides of various languages can be obtained at the information desks at 1k KRW. The audio guide is user friendly which detects exhibits automatically so you dont have to key in anything. The museum is well kept and organised and gives good explanation to the Josean dynasty. Worth going if you are heading to Gyeongbukgung grounds.
All About the Royals,"This was a free museum located off the main parade grounds of Gyeongbokgung Palace. We toured the Palace and grounds first, watched the changing of the guards ceremony before heading indoors to tour this museum. Inside there were three floors of history that covered practically all aspects of royal life, from birth until death, for the Joseon dynasty. The following stood out for us:-The display on royal processions was quite impressive as it explained the size and significance of the various groups of people who were required to escort the king during a formal outing. -The scientific accomplishments and capabilties including a water clock but unfortunately for us was going through maintenance during our visit. I thought the displays and their explanations was very well put together and held the interest of the whole family. Compared to the crowds attending the changing of the guards ceremony it felt like we had the museum to ourself."
Wonderful exhibits regarding royal life,"The museum is medium sized compared to most museums I've visited, but that means it is extensive enough to peak your interest but manageable enough to complete in one morning/afternoon session. The exhibits range all the way back to the 1300s until 1910 when the Korean royalty was overthrown by the Japanese."
Joseon Royalty ,I felt walking through here that a lot was expected from crown prince from birth that from the age of 5 it was constant preparation to lead a country and to be a great king. Not that it was easier on crown princess.It makes you reflect on the weight of a kingdom.
Live experience ,The palace museum shows a large collection and explanations of different king dynasties and different royal belongings during the last centuries. 
Visit during Lunar New Year,"Museum currently has an exhibit of things from Lichtenstein. While cool, it takes up most of the museum which leaves not a lot of information on Korean palaces. Overall, museum does a good job explaining what you are seeing and setting you up for Gyeongbokgung which is next door."
Korean history,A good place to learn about Korean history. The museum displays a lot of relics from Joseon dynasty to the Korean empire time. I particularly enjoyed watching the documentary of how Gyeongbokgung was constructed. The documentary was shown next to a giant building plan of the palace.
Their service tho,"I was just going to write a good review on this museum but then I met the people on the information desk so I decided to give it a poor one. It’s a small museum but I think it’s quite informative. I found it quite enjoyable, especially since they have a Liechtenstein exhibition when I visited the museum. So after walking around for quite a bit, I found out that they have these stamps with palaces (special) logos on it that you can stamped in a stamp book provided by the museum. On the desk where these stamps are provided, there’s a piece of paper mentioning that we should ask the information desk for the stamp book (if we want to get one). So I walked happily to the information desk with the sign “English” in front of it, with a big smile on my face I said hello since the lady (she looked maybe like late 30ish-40ish) there seemed to ignoring me. I said hello and then asked her politely can I get the stamp book here, and she rudely just staring at me and grunted “hmph” and without saying anything just waving and pointing her fingers at a small table near the information desk. I don’t know why she acted that way, is it because I’m Asian? I was just so shocked to find such a behavior from a “professional”. I don’t get it. The gentleman who was on the front door greeting us and smiled at us when we first walked in, so I thought at first “oh wow they’re really friendly”. FYI, it’s not that rare to find locals here even though they’re working in a service area to be rude to people with a darker skin tone. When I first got here a few days ago, in the airport I was asking to some uncle about the tax form desk, and he also just grunted at me and waving /pointing his fingers around with some broken English “later later you can find it”and he didn’t look at me at all while saying this. It’s like I was some nuisance that he couldn’t wait to get rid off. Oh yeah, actually the lady also did the same way, she also didn’t look at me while she’s pointing the table to me. The funny thing was, when I walked passed the information desk later on, there’s a couple from Europe asking the same thing to her and she even got up from her chair, gladly went with them to show them where to find the stamp book, with a big smile on her face, being chatty and all. So what’s the deal? Smh."
Entrance is hard to find but worth the effort,"It turns out the entrance is on the main street just passed the palace rather than directly from the palace, however I recommend visiting.The displays are interesting and mostly in English."
Rich Korean History,"This place is spacious and has many exhibits, great for anyone interested in the history of the country. As it is located at a side entrance of Gyeongbokgung, ie Gyeongbokgung Metro Station Exit 5, it is really convenient to visit."
Fabulous small museum on Gyeongbokgung Palace grounds,"I highly recommend a short visit to this wonderful museum on Korean history on the Gyeongbokgung Palace grounds. Most people opt not to visit the museum which is a shame. There is no admission fee. The museum can be easily covered in an hour or two. If anything, the museum is a great place for a short rest and (clean) bathroom break after touring the palace grounds. There is ample seating and the museum is very calm and peaceful. It’s actually worth visiting on its own independently from the Palace IMO. "
A good museum to visit after seeing the palace.,"This museum is free and right next to the main palace. It is worth seeing because the palace is mostly empty. You can learn a lot about royal customs here including clothing, birth, marriage, etc... There are many displays including 2 rare cars that the Korean king and queen owned. This is not the best museum in Seoul but it is still very good and a must visit for anyone interested in learning about the Korean royal history. The gift shop has some good quality souvenirs in various price ranges. I rarely buy things at attractions but this one actually had some good ones that I bought for a reasonable price."
A must see museum within the grounds of Gyeongbokgung Palace,3 stories museum with plenty of artifacts showcasing the history and culture of South Korea from infancy. You don't need a guide to explore this museum as they are well presented and laid for any one to enjoy and be informed/educated of the country's history. It is within the grounds of Gyeongbokgung Palace and is totally entrance free.
Definitely worth doing,We were surprised to see that this museum was free to visit. It contains a great deal of Korean history and culture. It also offers free Wifi for visitors and proved a godsend on a scorching day after doing the palaces.
Interesting,"Since I am a big fans of Korean Drama and also a history lover, visiting this national museum links me. I enjoyed very much. The museum provide a stamp book where you can put a stamp at the exit of each room. Exciting activities for my teens."
An average museum,"Although I have a great appreciation for museums of the world, I did not find this one particularly stunning. In fact, it was quite boring. Sparse highlights included a mural depicting the extent of the original palace grounds, the artifacts in section 5 on the 1st floor (1F), and the water clock in the basement. That was about it for me.English tours are given daily at 11:00 a.m. and 2:30 p.m. on the ground floor (which is actually level 2, or 2F in Asian countries). But the tours had apparently been cancelled the day we arrived, so we were given complimentary headsets with English descriptions instead. Unless you have nothing to do, I might just skip this altogether."
Small but Interesting Museum,It’s free admission to this museum which is next to the Gyeongbokgung Palace. This museum is next to exit 5 of the Gyeongbokgung Station for the L3 subway line. It is best to combine the visit to this museum with a visit to the Gyeongbokgung Palace and the National Folk Museum of Korea.The museum is well organized with displays in both Korean and English and provides an interesting view of royal life. There are also displays of scientific achievements of the Joseon Dynasty including a self-striking water clock.
Nostalgic Visit,"National Palace Museum of Korea - where artifacts and royal treasures from Joseon Dynasty to Korean Empire were kept. It displays records, paintings, royal clothes, state rites and other stuffs from royal families. It is very fortunate for me to visit this as i have been an avid fan of watching historical dramas and the fee was free. I was amazed how the intricate details of every artifact from seals, costumes, palanquins, paintings were preserved. The museum was divided into different states of the dynasty from Architecture, science, royal childbirth, royal life up to the last Korean empire. This is a must visit to fully understand and appreciate the Korean history."
Wonderful museum,"Fine museum focused on every aspect of life for Korean royalties, lots of interesting objects all displayed and explained clearly in multiple languages. There’s a lot to see, and many did not make it to the lower floors where there is an amazing self-striking water clock. The information provided actually gives me a better understanding of the Gyeongbokgung palace than a cursory walk through the expansive palatial grounds. This place is easy to miss given the large number of attractions in the area, but worth a couple of hours for someone interested in learning more about imperial life in Korea."
Excellent Museum ,"Visited this museum today. It is located in the compound of the Gyeongbokgung Palace. It is rest assured much more interesting than the Palace which is essentially a haunt of self seeking selfie takers.The museum is fascinating and looks at the rulers of the Chosun dynasty. From monarchies to palaces, from protocol, customs and ceremonies to every day life. Good mementos of the Emperors - their seals, portraits and artefacts. Royal cars, palanquins, flags, kitchen wear - you name it, it's here. This is a great museum to fascinate the inquisitive and the historian. Allow at least 2 to 3 hours. This should be a must on your list. "
Depository of History,"This place is another heaven for history lovers! The museum can be found inside the compound of Gyeongbokgung Palace, and does not charge admission fee. It is a huge place with various galleries that offer a clear glimpse of the past of South Korea. Displays inside the museum are traditional Korean costumes wore for different types of occasions, various artifacts from different eras, records, etc. I spent more than an hour touring the entire museum. It has a souvenir store at the lower ground floor. In addition, it also has a display of the various car models sponsored by famous car manufacturing company of South Korea. For car lovers, this display is located right in front of the souvenir shop. This museum is highly recommended for everyone, especially for heritage lovers.PS: This museum was also featured in the Legend of the Blue Sea. Another K-Drama Filming location bucket list."
Worth a visit whilst at the palace,"We thought we might as well look around here whilst visiting the palace and were happy we did. It’s a small museum but full of lovely things, the staff are so friendly there and seemed happy we had visited, 2 smiling ladies asked us to sign the guestbook and a security guard saw me stamping the rubber stamps in my journal, he came and found me as I was leaving and gave me a stamp booklet (you can get from the desk) filled out with all the stamps- it was just a very thoughtful thing to do"
The cafe is overpriced and has bad coffee,We visited gyeonbukgung palace and stopped in the cafe here for a quick coffee. It's cozy & comfy inside but it took ages to make the coffee and it was luke warm when we finally got it. I wouldn't recommend it. 
Excellent museum,"The National Palace Museum of Korea is within the grounds of the Gyeongbokgung Palace. It was opened in 1992. Many of the exhibits are mainly from the three palaces and date back to the Joseon Dynasty from late 14th century. The palaces are Gyeongbokgung, Changdeokgung and Changgyeonggung. The museum has exhibits like robes, jewelery, books and poems written by kings. There are nearly 50,000 items on display. On the lower floor is Emperor Sunjong’s royal vehicle – a 1918 General Motors Cadillac limousine. There is also a rain gauge pedestal to measure rainfall. The museum a learning program about experiencing royal culture. The first floor has displays about royal childbirth, education and culture. There are also various items that belonged to the Emperor. You will find a café and a souvenir shop.The second floor has exhibits of Joseon Dynasty that include clothes, paintings, instruments, royal seals, ceremonial items, water clock and other royal items.The lower floor has items relating to paintings, music and musical instruments.Admission is free. On weekdays, the museum is open from 9am to 6pm – the last entry being at 5pm. On weekends the opening hours are from 9am to 7pm – the last entry being at 6pm."
Well worth a repeat visit,"I visited this museum three years ago. Then I was impressed by the English speaking guide who walked the two of us around the exhibits and answered our many questions.Besides the regular exhibits, this museum occasionally holds special exhibitions, sometimes with a small charge but equally often free.On this occasion, there was a display of royal seals that had somehow ended up in a museum in the United States.One of the last acts by President Obama was the return of these cultural and historical objects to their rightful home.In times of conflict, many fine cultural and historically significant objects are looted and removed from their homeland.It's good that these were returned and not held in the US.I am against the idea of things like these in private collections.This museum is well curated and things are nicely displayed. There is plenty of room and several rest areas.'Lockers are available at a small charge and the rest rooms are immaculate."
Free museum,"Although it's inside the palace grounds, this museum is completely free and you don't need to visit the palace to see the museum. Considering all the Seoul palaces are bereft of antiquities and treasures, the museum is the only place you can discover what treats there might have been inside once upon a time. As of October 2017, the lower floors were all closed and the upper floor was partially undergoing renovations, but the ground floor was open."
A nice collection of royal seals.,"Visited the museum after checking out the Gyeongbokgung Palace. There were royal seals on display, a couple of royal cars etc. There were other royal regalia on display. It was alright, since I was there visiting the palace anyway."
Free to Visit,We visited this museum first before entering Gyeongbokgung palace. Entry was free and there were some interesting exhibits. Good for a short visit but history buffs would probably stay longer. Easy to access.
"Nice, but not really special","What caught my eyes were royal cars displayed in the museum. Otherwise, other museums offer more. It is free, which is a bonus."
Extensive Collection. Free Entrance,"The museum is located on the ground of Gyeongbokgung Palace. Very extensive exhibits of over 20,000 royal relics from the Joseon Dynasty. Very detailed information about about the royalty. It covers the Royal symbols and records, ancestral rites, palace architecture, Joseon sciences and the Royal life. A visit to the museum is a must if you plan on visiting Gyeongbokgung Palace. Free admission and it's conveniently located next to a metro stop. Take Orange Line 3 to Gyeongbokgung stop. "
Complements the Gyeongbokgung Palace,"This museum perfectly complements the Gyeongbokgung Palace by showcasing many royal artifacts from the 27 kings of the Joseon Dynasty, including a GM car from the early 20th century. Similar to the National Folk Museum nearby, entrance to this museum is also free although its exhibits are not as enthralling as the National Folk Museum. Your knowledge of the Joseon Dynasty will be complete once you cover the Gyeongbokgung Palace as well as the 2 neighboring museums."
"Big, comprehensive, free","Conveniently linked to the subway, this should be your first stop before visiting the palace to gain a better understanding of the history of the place. It is bigger than it looks and has lots of exhibit over 3 floors.We covered less than 2 floors after more than an hour and had to proceed to the palace as my toddler was getting bored and restless.It is free, making it a must-visit if you intend to visit the palace, or if you are short on time and deciding to skip the palace grounds."
Nice in combination with the palace ,"Admission is free so even if you don't like it, no harm no foul. The museum has some nice objects but nothing really spectacular, but you also get an insight into palace life and the sad short lived life of the Korean Empire. General descriptions are in English , items descriptions only give the name in English. "
Truly wonderful display,This museum contains a vast array of memorable artifacts.The layout is very simple and clear. The high spot for me were the two vinatage burgandy cars. Looked stunning.
Palace closed so...........,We went here after arriving to visit the Palace on a Tuesday (when it was shut):). So we decided to go into the museum (which is free). We took advantage of the headphone facility in English for a small price and spent the afternoon here. So much to see and read about. So glad in the end that we did this before going to the palace the next week. Great gift shop and video viewing area. Well worth the visit. Allow a few hours if really wanting to get the most from it.
One of the best museums in Seoul!,"This museum is better and more interesting than the National Museum of Korea. It has lots of detailed information about the life in Korean cities and court before the modern times. The layout is well thought out and easy to follow. Lots of interesting information at the side of exhibits and in audioguide. Also many exhibits have excellent videos to accompany them, like reconstructions of court rituals, how things were built, etc. There is one particulary interesting video about ancester worship in the court and another one how the royal tombs were built. One very interesting object amongst others is a first hour clock in Korea, built in 15th century, that struck the hours. If you are into history this museum is a place to visit. If you have little time drop the National Museum and visit this one instead. In the same territory you also get one of the main palaces (They are side by side) and at the back of the palace make sure you also visit Folk Museum. Palace Museum is more about the life of royalty in the past and Folk Museum is equally good, focusing on simple folks life in the past. The entry fee to both palace and Folk Museum is 3000 won (about 3 USD), palace museum is free."
Nice museum palace,The museum is located in and not far away from the city. The building is nice and many palace's stuffs here
Brief overview of Korean Palace life,A visit to this museum will give one a brief overview of Korean Palace life. This a good place to visit before going around the palace grounds so one will have a feel of the substance of the palace and other structures.
Quite interesting & informative. Good enhancement to a palace visit. But few English descriptions. ,"If you enjoy palaces, history and architecture, this is a place for you! The exhibits explain how the palaces were built, the architecture styles, techniques and ideas. Also displays with palace life, etiquettes and practices. Quite interesting. I enjoyed looking at the displays but alas, the descriptions were mostly in Korean. There is some English explanation but mainly summary or just a title. I wish there's more explanation in English so I could understand I more detail. Possibly not fun for younger kids who won't appreciate the exhibitions as they are not very interactive. "
Free and by the palace,So many of the museums are much the same for the foreigner and this one was no different. There is some English but for many of the exhibits all you get was the name of the item in English which you could in most cases guess anyway. I found that after a bit that I just walked round with just a casual glance at things. It also wasn't well sign posted on where to go next. I didn't find anything new in this museum that I hadn't seen in others. Or when there was something different there was no English explanation of it
Unmissable,"Please stop by the museum when you visit the 5 palaces, it is so worth visiting, especially to see the screen"
All about Joseon era,"Beautifully laid out in spacious halls, the history of the 500 years of Joseon rule is well featured here. Free admission, located just next to the main entrance to Gyeongbukgung, there is little to discourage anyone to visit. Worth the 0.5 to 1 hour visit together with the palace visit."
Palace Museum,Pretty big museum. Right by one of the main temples. Entrance is free. So rich in history. Good souvenirs. 1F is under renovation
Right next to Gyeongbok Palace,We're visiting the Gyeongbok Palace and the museum is right next to it. A nice break from the heat and learn some Korean culture and history.
Best Museum in Seoul!!,"I stumbled upon this museum when visiting Gyeongbokgung Palace--in fact you enter through the gate to the Palace and the museum is on your right--hidden. Free to enter and amazing exhibits. You can't miss the Korean Water clock, which defies description (it is two stories high). The place was deserted on a Saturday. You could spend hours here. A real gem and would be my first recommendation for a museum in Seoul. If I only have time for one museum---it would be this one. Don't miss it!!"
Following the TV series Jang Yeong-sil.,"Yeps, one goal at our Seoul trip was to see things that Jang Yeong-sil build and invented (or is told to be invented). Anyway, waterclock replica was awesome but we did not find proper replica for celestial globe. Later found there is replica somewhere south from Seoul but not proper one in any of Seoul museums :) Epic."
Great stop,"Unless you have a guide, or even if you do, this is a great stop at the beginning of any tour of the palace."
National Palace Museum,"For history, this is the place you must see. Well detailed and preserve.Free entrance, fyi. Near the Gyeobokgung Palace.Station Gyeobokgung."
Good museum,"This is a good quality museum and easy to get to using the metro. There are several exhibits, all worth seeing. The museum kept myself and my five year old interested the entire time we were there."
Spacious and well organised museum,"The National Palace Museum of Korea is located next to the Gyeongbokgung Palace. It is very easy to access via the subway Gyeongbokgung station. Lots of insight into the life of the kings and queens over 3 floors. From cars, paintings, musical instruments,royal seals etc it has artifacts from the palaces over the kingdoms. It is free but closed on Mondays. Gyeongbokgung palace is closed on Tuesdays to do take note. The restaurant serves decent but not fantastic food at reasonable prices."
Excellent introduction to Korean Royalty and the Joseon Period,"While this museum has been around for several years, the current version is a huge improvement over its past. (Actually, all the Korean national museums have been vastly improved over the past decade - and most of them now have free admission!)It is thoroughly modern with well thought out presentation of a very impressive collection of historical and recreated items and multimedia. Everything is in great preservation and lighting. Though I have lived in Korea for some 20 years, I learned a great deal visiting this museum recently. There is a decent gift shop and very pleasant coffee shop/traditional restaurant on the first floor (which may be mistaken to be in the basement as the main entrance is on the second floor).If you have any kind of interest in Asian royalty, the Joseon period of Korean history or traditional Asian arts, this is an excellent place to spend a half day."
"After a week of Chinese Museums, this was different (much better)","Easy access, right off the subway. Clean and well lit, fairly clear explanations in English, very friendly staff. Plenty to do for little kids. This is good for older, younger, dates, anybody. Free entry. Pricey gift shop. Awe inspiring air conditioning. Start on B1 and work your way up."
Interesting place,"This little museum covers about 500 years of the Joseon dynasty's lifestyle and their contributions to art and literature. The old scrolls provide an interesting insight into the development of the Korean alphabets. The dynasty was known for its passion for record keeping through resident scribes and hence a lot of scrolls and record books. My host said that even after the Korean alphabet had considerably evolved, the scribes preferred to write in Japanese and Chinese as it was considered a symbol of high status and intellect to be conversant in these langauages. Also of interest are the arts and crafts on display and also the traditional clothing. Some foods have also been recreated for display. My host later pointed a dessert to me in a restaurant where we had lunch that the same dish was also part of the Royal menu displayed in the museum. "
Museum is well lit and organized well for best viewing,"I found this museum to be well organized and easy to follow. The exhibits were not crowded, but were well appointed with care and artistry. I liked the vehicle that the emperor traveled in. It was beautifully restored and displayed. Right next to it was the conveyance where the emperor was carried not he shoulders of bearers in earlier times.This was part of a tour given for airline travelers waiting for flights that had a stopover of more than 6 hours. It was well worth the time for the tour. Right across the street we saw a parade with men dressed in costume marching across the square."
Short but interesting tour,"I was very much curious about the Joseon Dynasty since in the Korean drama series, even in Hot Brain Problematic Men, they all mentioned about this dynasty. I was able to understand why people mostly referred to that dynasty."
The National Palace Museum of Korea,"THE NATIONAL PALACE MUSEUM OF KOREALocated on the very spacious grounds of the Gyeongbokgung Palace, the most exquisite palace in Seoul, are the National Palace Museum and the National Folk Museum of Korea. The National Palace Museum of Korea has about 40,000 artifacts from the Joseon Dynasty palaces, highlighting the life of the royal families, spread over a period of about 500 years .It covers their lifestyles, traditions, costumes, form of Government and administration, and the like. At the same time, the lives of the common folk of Korea also find a place in this museum. Royal artifacts on display at the museum include a portrait of Emperor Gojong, the 26th Joseon sovereign, seated dressed in all his traditional finery. Numerous other paintings feature the members of the royal court. Another exhibit is of a traditional ceremonial robe with enormously wide sleeves, worn by lady members of the Royal family, including the Queen and the crown princess, on special occasions. Korean jewellery of that day showed a surprising level of sophistication. Much space is taken up by ceremonial rites in which the royal court’s attendants, dressed in their ceremonial splendor, would participate, while members of the royal family would ride in palanquins as a symbol of their status. When the King sat on the royal throne, to his rear would always be a painted screen featuring the Sun and Moon, a river with fish in it, as well as the peaks of five sacred mountains. That symbolized the universe of that time. Among the early attempts by Korea at science and technology was a much-publicised “self-striking water clock” On display is the painstaking restoration of an original water clock. The flow of water would trigger off chimes to announce the time of day. The fine pottery on display includes a pot with a stylized turtle head. Korea has been a leader in pottery and fine porcelainware over the centuries. Development came to Korea, at least in part, through contacts with the Western world. Among the displays is a small Cadillac car, in mint condition, specially made by General Motors for Emperor Sunjong. In keeping with the times, a partition separated the driver from the royal passengers to his rear.Hormuz P. Mama (372 words)"
Great museum!,"This is a concise museum right next to the main palace in the Palace District of Seoul, and while not everything was translated in English, my husband and I still learned a lot from this museum. It made our time at the palace more interesting!"
simply gorgeous place!,The museum is free and admission does not cost anythingI love the national Palace Museum it's got great display of artwork and history!!! If you are into history and want to learn more about Korea this is the place to go!
Know more about the palaces in Korea,Separated into few ares and showing different palaces' history. King's costumes & arts were presented in the museum
Short but useful knowledge,In here you could learn about south korea history and tradition with interesting display. Good for family holiday.
Great to visit.. Free Admission,"The museum is located adjacent to Gyeongbokgung Palace and accessible through Subway Line 3 to Gyeongbokgung Station. The admission is free of charges. The museum definitely worth visiting and we enjoyed exploring the very interesting items exhibited overs several floor, including the royal classic cars."
"A fine collection, nicely displayed","Like many people, we went there just after the Palace. It is right next door and entrance is covered by the same ticket.Nothing exciting or worldview changing here, but they have some nice pieces and they are lovingly displayed. Spacious galleries with well-lit showcases.Most of the exhibits have royal associations, with a particularly fascinating collection of objects associated with venerated royal ancestors. We were also taken with the tuned slabs of slate that can be played like a xylophone, in the musical instrument section.Welcoming restaurant and extensive gift shop in the same warm, modern building. Combine it with the palace and the other museum nearby and you have yourself a day trip.Access from a very convenient subway station."
Provides the context behind your visit to Gyeongbokgung Palace,"The National Palace Museum of Korea (free entry) is one of the two museums located on the grounds of the Gyeongbokgung Palace grounds. Opening Hours are 9-6pm weekdays, 9-7pm weekends, closed on Mondays. Relocated to the modern building in the southwest part of the Gyeongbokgung, the museum provides visitors opportunity to learn about the Jesong Dynasty, who ruled Korea for five centuries. The collections also provide helpful context behind what you see when walking the palace grounds before or after your visit. There are supposedly over 40,000 historical artefacts at the National Palace Museum, with a handful of which are considered national treasures. The museum is spread over three floors and includes 11 permanent exhibition where you find historical portraits and paintings, maps, manuscripts, palace furniture, royal clothing, instruments, items of early astronomy and many more wonderful possessions associated with Gyeongbokgung Palace and the Royal family. Highlights for me included seeing the King Jesong portraits, procession carriages, ancient sundials and the fascinating restored model of Jagyeokru, a large-scale 15th century water clock seen in the Jesong Science Room. In the end, I really enjoyed this museum collection finding it to have done a fine job of providing context and background to what visitors are seeing in the rest of the palace grounds. The museum is an intricate part your visit to Gyeongbokgung and shouldn't be skipped if you plan to visit the palace while in Seoul. You can comfortably see the National Palace Museum of Korea in 30-45 minutes if you are short on time or you can explore the collection more thoroughly and easily spend a couple of hours here as well. Note: There are free guided tours given in Korean, Japanese and English. Check the online website for times and details."
Easy to reach on the underground,"The museum is very well-designed and entrance, as in most cultural places in Seoul, is free. The museum is very close to the large palace of Gyeongbokgung. Avoid visiting on a Monday, it is closed then.The various galleries have magnificent displays from the Joseon dynasty, from paintings and screens to costumes and ceremonial robes or from furniture to ritual instruments. I particularly enjoyed the 8-fold screen of King Jeongjo's Procession to an ancestral tomb in Hwaseong."
Great museum,"My husband and I visited this museum on a Tuesday. As the palace and the folk museum (both next to the National Palace Museum) are closed on Tuesdays, it resulted in the very few people visiting this museum that day which suited us fine. There's nothing worse than a crowded and noisy museum in my books. We throughly enjoyed the exhibits, even though 2 of them were closed for renovations. We also rented the audio guide for ₩1000 per set which gave interesting information. There are also toilets and water coolers on every floor. "
Interesting Glimpse into the Past,"Entrance to the museum is free. Very clean, upmarket and interesting. You can take guided tours in English,Korean, Japanese and Chinese."
