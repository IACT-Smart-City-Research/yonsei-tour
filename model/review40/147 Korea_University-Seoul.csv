Living in this neighborhood ,University and working life canâ€™t be the same for sure. The campus has best scenery on fall when the leaves turn into a colorful scenery. 
Amazing winter like in Europe,"Guys...if you wanna feel something different in your winter vacation, just visit one of the best universities in South Korea, Korea University. After snow fall, go directly to Korea University Station (Line 6) exit 1 and go to the main campuss... its such a wonderful white snow.."
Good university with cozy atmosphere,"C ( 17.10.26 ) This university was located in downtown, so the ground was not bigger than I think. There was good for stroll with cozy atmosphere. There had modern and Gothic building, so the harmony was good to me."
Beautiful grounds.,"I am currently on exchange at KU, and have been studying here since February. I have been lucky enough to see four seasons on this campus and I can guarantee no matter which time you come, you will have a lovely time exploring.There are some great photo opportunities here as well, such as in front of Central Plaza and the Science Campus gardens. It's also a great place to have a picnic or just relax, taking in the scenery."
Education place at Seoul,"I visited at during week-end. Easy to access, you can walk, visit main building (underground level) students working, eating, some family visiting university with their kids, no stress, good place to be calm. It is not touristic place but a heritage of education."
Beautiful scenery,"I'm currently studying in Korea University for the summer (June-August), and I'm enjoying my time here very much. Buildings are not only well constructed, they are also rather amazing and grand. Couples can take nice photos (even wedding photos!) in front of Inchon Memorial Hall. Amenities in school include Hana Bank (local Korean bank), many different cafes (E.g. Aricafe), and convenience stalls. There is also a health center located in school, with medical amenities. "
Vast ground,Situated on its own hill. Korea University runs its own shuttle service into campus. I took a taxi there. I also found out this university is serviced by airport bus. Good to explore the grounds of one famous university in Seoul. 
Beautiful architecture ,"Took a walk around this university with my boyfriend after our lunch at a nearby restaurant. It is such a huge university and the architectures are very beautiful. It is very well built and modern. There are some cafes, fast food restaurants, convenient stores, book store and etc within the campus. Felt impressed by the architecture. It is located very near to Anam station (line 6). If you are nearby the campus, take a walk there and look at the architectures. Nice! "
Western Architecture,"Instead of korean building, here we can see a lot of western architecture. You can easily access this place as it is near to station"
stayed 6 weeks at this campus,I was on this capmus from June to August of 2015 for the International Summer campus. I stayed at Cj international house on campus. The dorm is awesome. Great ac for the summer weather.Overall the campus is huge with a lot of hills. It totally do able just go up the back way by Frontier house.The program there is good for experience but I wouldnt recommend the learning korean in six weeks especially if you are a beginner. The food on campus is so so. However there are alot of good places around campus to eat and also campus. I recommend those.
Korea University ,"I am studying in Korea University now and I think my living of study in here is quite good.Korea university is the oldest one in South Korea.It was set up in 1905 .You can see many ancient buildings with a modern inside.Studying in here is such a good rest,everything is opening to it's students.My favorite place is lounge in central plaza.Because some time I can get free food for my breakfast.Ok,I am pulling your leg.The real reason is the reading room and lounges are very good for studying.You can come here and feel everything by your own."
Unexpected,Was doing a talk at the school. Was thoroughly impressed by the school and grounds. Was like an impressive English University ground. Beautiful architecture and facilities. 
Hidden gem that most of travel guide missed out,"Most of tourists from HK go to hongik or ewha women's university actually for shopping, but Korea university is total different. It's a true quite campus with beautiful trees, grass & building, you could soak in such academic environment, feel like back to campus & experience golden time again. I go in may, for sure it will be much more beautiful in fall with red leaves everywhere"
