A visit to the past,"This place lies one of the most beautiful photo spots in Gunsan, it really worth the photos! Also there is a lot of costumes rental shop where you can put clothes from decades ago, really worth the visit!"
It was a colorful experience!,It was so much fun dressing up in old-timey school uniform in Gyeongamdong Railroad Town! The place is also full of nostalgic/childhood shops. It was a colorful experience!
Quaint Little Village,"It took a while figuring out how to get here from Seoul. There are no trains apparently so i had to go to Express Bus Terminal station to take a bus to Gunsan. It costs 12,800 KRW and its at Gate 8. The journey takes about 3 hours.You can easily get a map from the terminal in Gunsan. You might want to ask if you are lost. The village is quaint. Lots of photo op can be done along the way. The snacks sold are really old school. Take your time as you walk along the track."
