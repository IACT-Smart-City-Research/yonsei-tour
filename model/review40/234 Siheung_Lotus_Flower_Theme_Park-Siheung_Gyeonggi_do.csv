Great Place!,"这是个宽广、清新、凉爽的地方。由于这里没有很多树，因此建议在夏天的傍晚时分去游玩，以至于不会被阳光晒的太热。它是一个让人在闲情逸致散步的同时也拍一些照片留念的美丽大花园。但响亮的连续不停的播放或演唱韩国老歌并伴随着击鼓表演等，觉得并不应景反而破坏了本来该有的雅静气氛，令人烦躁。It was a wandful place which was wide,fresh and cool. Ofcouse, It was better to visit at dusk in summer since there were no more trees and might make you hot. Anyway, it was an amazing big garden to enjoy ecepted very noisy and continuous old korean songs. Probably you would like to take photos during walking around the park."
