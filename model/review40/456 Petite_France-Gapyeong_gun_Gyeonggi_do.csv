Excellent destination for families,Pretty French style houses standing on the hills. A village of children stories and beautiful landscape! Excellent destination for families!
Boring. Simple,"I really do not understand this as an attraction at all. It was cost around $6 USD to walk around for 20 minutes to see what looks like a little town for children in a theme park. It was boring, tacky, and uninteresting. I would not waste time visiting here. I didn't even bother taking a photograph."
Not really worth a visit,Not really worth the visit here as there are nothing much to see except for colorful building. Save the $$$ for other places.
Petite france,petite france is a very nice place already beautiful. there is also a Korean drama shooting location. and very suitable for coming during winter
Only good for Korean drama fans,Everything seems romantic and happy here but I prefer the real things instead of fake ones. Luckily it was a stop on the way to Nami Island.
Nostalgic,You feel being transported back in time with small village in FranceWell preserved collection and you remember why the little prince book was one of your favourites 
Waste of time,"Petite France and Nami Island are owned by the same owner. Therefore, those two places are always bundled together in the tour package. A very very small one road village. The icon picture basically have it all. Do not go there. Nothing to see or to do. Expensive entrance free when compare to those beautiful palaces in Seoul. "
Adorable place,"Purchased a 1 day tour ticket from Travideals and went there for leisure and experience. Petite France has a nice scenery in terms of cute and colourful buildings. But I think going here as a 1 destination is not worth, lucky my 1 day tour also included Nami Island!"
A little disappointing,"I wasn't that impressed with Petite France, regardless of how pretty it was. It didn't remind me of France, more of a cross between Germany (architecture) and Italy (colours). My wife and teenage children surprisingly did enjoy themselves so I can't award a ""terrible"" review. Usually included on tours to Nami Island, you may as well go but don't have high expectations!"
Nothing more attractive,"This is the french styled village and a forest way inside good for kids.There is a puppet show worth seeing.Its like a amusement park not worth specially going.However,photography is enjoyable"
Do not get me wrong,"This place has been made for this purpece only, is More of a móvie set with coffee shops and restaurant in a very lovely natural sightseeing "
Miniature France,Travelled here after a morning trip to Nami Island. It’s a small park that can be covered in 1-2 hours. Might be suitable for young children.
Place like a movie,Nice place to go with family who have children. Very beautiful and pleasant to eyes. The place also easily reachable by bus
Beautiful Petite ,Such a beautiful place to visit. Great view and great place. Lucky we were here not many tourist around. We enjoyed our time taking picture and the scenery! 
Petite France,"As the name implies, you see a small France. The houses, statue, Eiffeel tower, fountains etc. are France. They have puppet show also that we enjoyed."
Nice place to take photos but that's pretty much it,"Petite France or 'little' France as the name suggests is a french-styled town. Nice place to take pretty photos as the buildings, furniture & landscape is quite attractive though I doubt it's authenticity to actual towns in France."
"Do not, I repeat DO NOT, Waste Your Time going to a micro French village in East Asia name Petite France","It's all extremely deceiving. It's based on the love of the book, The Little Prince, that is somehow a cultural favorite in South Korea. If you are not a lover of South Korean movie and culture, you are completely wasting your time. Additionally if you're not with kids younger than 4 do not go there. It was really misleading ......we were told we would find it interesting, what we found was that we lost a day of our trip..... this is a thorough waste of time except for those with a four year old that wants to take pictures standing next to the Little Prince. If this is a cultural highlight of the country..... WHOA!"
Just take photo if you like,"I find it not worth to take time to visit, as I am not the Korea movie lover nor Petite France lover. I go to Gapyeong by myself, after ride bike, than take taxi here, it cost me over 20000 won. As I had not buy suttle bus tickets, I find it difficult to find taxi here. "
Bike stealing capital of France ,"According to the police , do not leave bikes even locked up securely as they will get pinched regardless, police said 100's a day pinched "
Over-hyped Destination,"I loved the place but I think the blogs have exaggerated it. For me, nothing is too special about the place. But it is really Instagrammable place. A visit is still recommended."
Worth Going to As a Tour Stop But Not as A Standalone Destination,"Petite France was a quirky and gaudy mini theme park that would transport you to an old French village. A number of its major attractions center on the Little Prince, evident in how there's a small but beautiful museum dedicated to the works of Saint-Exupery. However, a lot of its attractions showcase the owner's extensive antique collection; which failed to pique my interest (some of them such as the doll collection were borderline creepy). There were pockets of beauty, such as spots which allow you to see the strikingly beautiful natural landscape that surrounds the area; and the surprise gallery (leading to the comfort room) which features jaw-droppingly beautiful glassy portraits. Ultimately though, it makes for an interesting tour stop; but I would not recommend this being the only thing in your itinerary. As a fan of The Little Prince, I also expected unique merchandise for sale in their souvenir shops. Unfortunately, I came out of both shops empty-handed."
Didn't meet my expectations,I thought it would be some little old french village. This a cartoon land. Good for taking pictures. Nothing much for kids to play around. There is puppet show at certain hours. 
feels abandoned,"This place was not really maintained well. Some paints were faded or chapped, there were some cobwebs too. Not much to do here really. They did have a museum for marionettes and porcelain dolls if you are into those. And if you are a fan of the Little Prince, this may be worth a visit."
a bit boring and small place,"If you have time to spend... then go, else bypass this France village. A place which I will not go for second visit."
Great place for insta-worthy photos!,"Highly-recommended as the place is so beautiful for photo-taking. Only downpoint is the lack of cafes, snack kiosks or restaurants for tourists to relax and enjoy the scenery. Just 1-2 hours is enough to tour around the area."
Sightseeing,"It was about an hour away from Nami Island. Decided to do it back to back as it was along the way from Chuncheon back to Seoul. My friend said that there are tourist day packages from Gapyeong station tourist counter that includes bus ride for these nearby attractions, unfortunately i didnt know about it.Petite France is such a lovely, cozy and quaint place! They have lockers just in front of the ticket counter if you wanna keep your luggage. Just after you enter, on the right they have the showtimes available for the day. I went for all 3 types of shows. The Orgel intro was mostly observing as it was all in korean so i didnt understand much. The Hand Puppet Theater was interesting. Though it was in korean too, i could roughly understand as the story they told was of Little Red Riding Hood. All of it was in korean but i still find it relatively entertaining and funny. The puppet shoe near the amphitheater is the best. It has no speech but all of it is just puppeteering so no language bareers here. Its exteremly funny and very impressive how they control the puppets so intricately.The exhibits here are not bad however i have no real interest so i just had a look around, some where very impressive. The general area is very nice to take photos if you wish. They have a small cafe that sells snacks and limited food options if you're famished. Worth the visit because of the shows, in my opinion!"
Little France in South korea,Love this place... Romantic and beautiful place.you can enjoy little france ambience in this place.You must take epic photos in this place
Average,"Visited this place twice: in December and early May. The decorations were prettier in December probably because of Christmas. There is nothing much in this place apart from the bright coloured architecture and French antiques. Visit if you really love The Little Prince or is a fan of some of the kpop dramas that were filmed here. I am a fan of neither and found the place rather boring after awhile. On a side note, there are performances and shows at scheduled timings so do take note of the timings if you wish to catch those performances! Overall, not a must-visit so dont waste your time here if your time is limited. "
It was okay,"The place is cute, but it's small area space makes it very crowded. There's not much to see and the place is built on a hill so expect a lot of climbing and walking uphill. Not really PWD friendly. The marionette shows were really fun to watch tho.The things that make this place special are: Runningman and My Love from another star.I suggest that you visit other places."
Better to visit other sites in Gapyeong,"After a couple of hours at Nami Island, travelling out of the way to Petite France was a big letdown. Unless you've an interest in brightly coloured french architecture, some intricately designed porcelain pieces and a room full of old puppets, I'd recommend giving this site a big miss."
Confusing .....and weird ,"If your bored and looking for some time to kill then I guess there are worse places to visit. So our guide (a day tour with K tours that visits 3 sites including this place) told us the whole concept and ""theme park"" was created by a local business man (with way more money than sense If you ask me) because he took a trip to France and fell so in love with the place he wanted to recreate it in seoul.  It's cute and quirky has a few cafes and a gift shop...but that's about it. You can walk around the Frence style buildings and take a few pics.  100% do not miss the puppet show it's awesomely rubbish but in a funny way. "
runningman shooting place,"quite okay la for me nothing special but this is second pit stop after nami island so u can choose to stop or continue to 3rd pit stop garden of morning calm. but if u want nice photo for instagram etc they have traditional cloths, u can wear with no additional cost."
Nice to see,Kids would love to see this kind of place. It has lots to see. Structures built was unique and amazing.
Le Petit Merde,"Total waste of time, extremely fake and poor quality workmanship. Skip at all cost, don't bother to come. "
Still Wondering What It Is For,Maybe ok for Koreans who have never been to Europe but in my opinion it is not worth a visit. Not good if you are in a wheelchair!!
"Magnifique, Petite France!","It's a cozy little place. Our group was lucky because at the time of our visit, there was a puppet show at the open theater ❤ The rest room is far tho but I still adore the place. They have a display of antique stuff that I adored looking. What I especially love are the fresh fruits sold across the place. The strawberries, oh my! and the price was just right And the ice cream, mouthwatering "
Why Visit Something so unKorean in Korea?,Came here as part of a package to Nami Island.Boring place with some nice (albeit fakey) photo spots.Saving grace was that i liked the puppet show. That's about it. Save your time for something else
Not worthy a place to visit ,"Waste of time and money. I agree that it is a place near nami island, but this place is not place for tourists. First you are in Korea, you want to see traditional places. Second it's not a park for sight seeing neither family activity. Third where is the France style in that place? Creepy dolls and figures in each corner and a just some colour houses. The signs only in Korean so I don't know if the creepy little prince story is written."
Wonderful if youre into the Little Prince,A good side trip before Nami Island. But to be honest not that spectacular in itself.Feels like a tourist trap.
Interesting ,I love how cute this place is. I had fun while strolling around this area and I love the night view more because of the lighting 
Day Trip from Seoul in Autumn,"Petite France was probably the least value within our Day Trip program. Especially for people who have been to Europe, the small and artificial and rough architecture lacks refinement, cultural details and of course, lacks life and functions. Nevertheless, it was still good for a few nice pictures especially before sunset and after with lighting."
Cool view,"Great to have the opportunity to view all collectibles made by the owner. Huge place and the cold breeze from Siberia chilled through my nape! -10degrees. Just before Petite France entrance, there’s a kiosk selling food for snack. I ❤️ their traditional egg bread. Just a piece, I got to buffer my lunch. Across the street, treat yourself to freshly plucked strawberries. Very juicy, sweet and satisfying for KRW7,000. "
A must visit!,"I visited this place with my sister last year when it was raining. However, we still did enjoy our time! We went with a tour group so our time was limited, which isn’t really bad but because it was raining it was kinda tough. But like I said, it was still a great time and will definitely recommend this place to everyone!"
Very Petite,"its a french style theme park. It looks like you are in a small french village community. there is a antiques and a wooden bridge so you can walk and enjoy the lake nearby. a replica of eiffel tower also, there are other french inspired houses and artifacts. an amphitheater is located near the entrance.i suggest you come here early before you go to other tourist spot nearby because tendency it will become crowded during late part in the morning and afternoon. there are some store outside of petite france if you want to buy something or have a snack."
Viva la france in seoul,Cute place ala french village. Not so big place but its nice experience to go into the houses which decorated ala french style. Theres also a free puppet show.
Not worth it,"Don't be tricked by the look of the place. There is nothing inside except creepy dolls and figurines. We were done with the place in 5 mins. Entrance of 10,000 krw should not be charged as there was nothing to view at all. Do not visit. "
A visit to Petite France,We went to Petite France after Nami Island visit since it is about 20 minutes drive away. It is a small place with France collections from toys to furniture etc. There are two restaurants there and one must not forget to take pictures when you are up there since there is a place you can view the Nami Island river surrounded by mountains. Overall Petite France is average and don't expect too much to see.
A store for french aficionados,"Why would anybody who travel to Korea, but would like to see how is a France city look like. Petite France is just a 'small' theme park that design/setup to look like a france town. Nothing special actually. Just a few building to show how a french house look like, out side & in side (there are a male french bedroom, female french bedroom, a french kitchen look a like etc). The whole place, actually look more like a 'rich person' (who have a passion for a french things) place to keep/store it possession. Probably people came here, because it is near to the more famous Nami Island. And the price for entrance is just exorbitant, for such a place."
Not Worth of Our Travel,"The entrance fee is KRW 10,000. I didn’t find the place worth of the entrance fee and not worth of our time visiting this place. I am completely not impressed. We stayed in the place like 5 minutes."
Waste of time--skip if you can,"Spent about 45 mins in this place as part of the tour package we booked. To be perfectly honest, the place is very underwhelming, with not much to do/activities in the area. Just a place to have some photos taken---that's it. Our tour guide didn't give us much background for this stop, maybe because there isn't much to say except that it is a tribute for the book, The Little Prince.Don't bother going here again and head straight to Nami Island or to your next destination."
A little bit of France in South Korea,"Petite France is a little specially designed and built tourist village in South Korea, built to look VERY much like a small piece of a French village. My partner and I visited Petite France as part of a full-day coach tour from Seoul that also included a visit to Nami Island.This is a kind of theme park/village that is designed to look very much like a small French Village. The architecture, shops, building etc., are all (kind of) in the French style, and if you were to be immediately dropped in the main little street you would not realise that you were actually in South Korea. Whether you would immediately recognise it as being France might be a point of discussion. This small village was constructed in 2008 in the Gyeonggi Province. It is located more than one and a half hours drive east of the city of Seoul.Petite France is small, unique and specially-built tourist village that actually looks French, albeit perhaps a little ""over the top"", and is very colourful. Well worth a visit if you happen to be anywhere in the area, but I would suggest not worth a trip all the way from Seoul solely to visit here unless your trip is part of a larger trip/tour to visit other places as well, as you could probably only want to spend a maximum of 1-2 hours here.Petite France does provide the ability to take many colourful photos, both of the small village itself, as well as in the peaceful and sprawling gardens across the side of the hill on which the village and gardens are located."
Good for a 30-minute photo op,"‘Twas freezing cold when we visited so it was difficult to pose for pictures, really. Nothing much to do. Small kids would enjoy the animal balloon-making show at the marionette theater. It’s not really worth your while traveling a long distance to visit here but if it’s along the way to Nami Island then it would be good for a 30-minute photo op. "
What the heck did I just experience? ,"It's minus 11 degrees outside, on this tour to nami Island and we stopped here. This is so weird. Its nothing like France. Our tour guide had no idea what it was either. Wikipedia said some rich bloke built it in the country side so his poor mates could see what France is like. Its just bizzare. Nice little stop if it wasn't absoloutly baltic outside. There's a marionette room. Steer clear of that if you have a fear of clowns and puppets. I didn't have a fear before this room... "
Average,Good place for photos .. that is pretty much I cd say.. chose this as part of Nami Island and railbike package. Should have chosen Garden of morning calm instead... 
Nice Xmas Light Up,"Xmas light up is nice, make the place feel warmer with freezing cold weather, other than that the place is too quiet, there isn't any performance or is there a time schedule for the performance but we are not aware or informed when purchase entrance ticket at the ticket counter.We walk around about an hr, took some photos with colourful buildings, nice but building look fake.If there is performance in open area will make the place more lively to visit."
A postcard from France!,"A brilliant idea that has paid off with visitors from far and wide...A financial success... only the owner will know! But seems to doing alright!Never been to France.. this picture postcard scene will give one a quick and enlightening look of what to expect.Houses, shops reconstructed to the French style in an enclave .People everywhere, roaming 5he few streets(Rue) on a hillside. Yes... it’s crowded!Yes.. it is picturesque! Yes.. it’s worth the entry fee! Yes.. toilets, seating. , food available within.Rate 7.5/10"
Tribute to Le Petit Prince,"Basically a small French village themed to Antoine de Saint-Exupéry’s novel, Le Petit Prince (The Little Prince.) Every angle in Petite France is postcard worthy...it's that pretty."
Cute... okay what's next?,"Petite France is very beautiful during snowfall. All i can say is.. take a picture with the colorful house models, then boom! You are done. I really do love the concept but everything is ""look inside, nod your head, and on to the next house."" The only wow effect is the first time you see it. Walking around was okay, see the view of the lake and mountains, more colorful houses. Dont get me wrong, if youre into colors and cute stuff, it's a place for you to go. Maybe i didnt have enough time to indulge on it but definitely winter is a good time to go!"
Petite France,"Petite France is the last site visited on a day tour from Seoul. It's a wonderful set of buildings on a hillside, with different themes. Be ready to walk uphill and take pictures, with a scenic backdrop. We skipped the adult theme but we went into the gift shop where we found marvelous music boxes. Be sure to drop by the gift shop!"
European attraction,"Petite France is a replica of a French village, a brainchild of a wealthy Korean who wanted to share his French experience with his countrymen.It's a neat attraction, something to marvel especially for those who have not visited France or any European country village.Each structure showcases a wide array of collectibles that include fancy figurines, including European furniture. There's no relevance to Korean culture or history... just for the curious eye."
Its AMAZINGGGGG,a must-go! it feels magical! highly recommend to go if you are going on a trip with children! the place is colourful and the vibes are good
"Petite France, South Korea","This place was part of the tour we took. It was the last place we visited for the tour. Nothing much here except the French inspired architectures for photos. It has been featured in k-dramas and variety shows. It was the location for the popular Korean Drama ""You who come from the stars"". It was small area that not much time is needed to explore the area."
Nothing much to do,"It rained a little when we visit last October 26, 2018. There is not much to do there just picture taking. If you are not a K-drama fan you can skip this place. There are many better places to visit."
nothing to see,"We did a tour of Korea and this was one of the stops. It actually sounded very interesting, but once we got here, we didn't understand why we were here. I guess some Korean man went to France and really loved it. So he brought France to Korea. It has French architect and French inspired decor, but very underwhelming. They have a food court type for drinks and food. Unfortunately we didn't eat too much breakfast and wanted to get some snacks. The pizza we got was pulled out from the fridge, and microwaved. The best part of this place was the clean bathrooms. Definitely not worth going."
Little Prince,"We joined a one-day tour to visit the Petite France. It was quite cool in the morning and the weather was quite foggy. Actually there's nothing much to see, but a place with some ""checkpoint"" for photo-taking. "
A little boring for me,Nothing much to see there. Just a tourist spot and it is close to Nami Island. The running man show used film at this location. 
Not so impressed,"This place came with Nami Island tour package. The place is nice but nothing really special except of you are into K-dramas. It's not that bad, it's an ok place to visit."
Colorful but Nothing Special,One of the attractions included in a 1-day local tour trip. Not a must go place but no harm to visit. Nice to take pictures as the destination is very colorful.
A time to remember the childhood,Petite France in Cheongpyeong-myeon is really a nice place to visit where in you can remember your childhood days how happy to be young. You have a feeling that your in France. A lot of houses to see and beautiful colorful flowers will amazed you. You will not regret the time you visited the place.
Tourist Trap,"This place is an artificial village where Korean Dramas are filmed. I wasn’t a big fan of it. I think it would’ve been better if there was a nice set down restaurant or someKind of activity for visitors. On the flip side, the painted buildings are pretty, but not worth the trip."
OK but nothing special,OK if you are in the area but definitely not a destination location. Somehow these folks created a Disney style village about an hour out of Seoul. Some decent shops and restaurants in this compressed area. I must admit I am confused as to why I had to pay to enter an area to but stuff. Very clean and a nice walk. Not really sure why it’s here. Seem out of place. Good place to kill an hour. Nice view of the river.
If you have nothing better to do,We stopped by after our trip to Nami Island since we already had the all day tourist bus pass. It's not a French village but mostly facades painted to appear real. We took some photos and left. I would not recommend you pay the admissions price or spend any time here. If they did not charge an entry fee I would say maybe.
It's ok :p,"I joined a tour to this place, during Korea Thanksgiving. We arrived the destination very early. Without haste we hiked up the highest and furthest area of the track, the view was soso, with a large pond and some houses. On the way, there were a few location you can take photos with petite prince. The France village of colourful houses, was very nice, but the rest wasnt as fascinating. But there was a puppet show in the plaza, that was very fun to watch :)"
Nice French village in Asia,Cutest and coolest French village that I’ve ever been. The place is huge and quite a bit of hiking at some parts. The architecture is so nice with so many instagrammable spots. It’s a good stopover before heading to Nami Island.
European setting,"We arrived early to catch the marionette show, it was good then we started roaming the place. It has a european setting. Every house contains the owners collection of his trips to europe. ambiance was nice. The place is not that big but very well organized."
French Cultural Village,"Petite France is a French Cultural Village which is reachable from Seoul via subway. The nearest station is Gapyeong, from where the Gapyeong City Bus can be boarded. A day pass purchased in the bus allows one to hop on and off the bus any number of times in a day and travel to other nearby attractions such as Nami Island and The Garden of Morning Calm.Petite France has colorful French houses, antique shops and beautiful gardens that provide an umpteen number of photo opportunities. There is also a long walking trail for trekking lovers and several free performances such as String Puppet Show and Hand Puppet Show."
Little Prince Village,"Paying tribute to The Little Prince, this exquisite French village on the hills is a nice place to visit for its quaint settings and to get to know a bit more of the French culture through the mini-museums located around the compound and the street performances and shows.A tad far away so I won’t recommend making a trip all the way here unless you’re on your way to Nami Island or something then it’s worth a quick visit. "
Strange thought at first but also very cute,"Worthwhile visiting here, although a bit strange for us being from the UK thinking about a little France in the South Korean hills, however, it was really nice and I enjoyed it thoroughly. Lots to see and take pictures of. Cute even if you have been to France a lot and also nice if you haven't been at all. It was an extremely hot day in June when we visited and I had problems getting a normal bottle of water so I would recommend taking water with you, as you will be walking and climbing hills/steps. There are a few ice cream and pretzel stops however no plain water apart from in vending machines. I particularly enjoyed the doll room which had lots of weird dolls including porcelain-faced dolls which were a bit scary, but also fantastic in a way too. I would highly recommend here to anyone who likes France, French architecture, etc. I really had a great although very active day. Please wear loose comfortable clothing and footwear for this place and bring suncream. "
A little French compound to include in your places to visit,"This was very close to Nami Island. We went here before we headed to Nami Island. It's a little city with French accents. If you have read the book, ""The Little Prince"" you'll see the major characters here carefully placed around this little village in statues and figurines. In my opinion, the ticket was a bit pricey for something that there were hardly any activities to enjoy except sightseeing. Since this little village was perched on a hilly side of the mountain, expect sudden slopes and steep terrains when exploring the whole area. If you have old people with you, you may want to accompany them on stairs as there were some pathways with narrow and steep stairs. One of the reasons we visited this was because some of the scenes from the ""Love from the Star"" korean telenovela were shot here. Overall, it was a nice experience to visit."
Man made French village ,"This is a man made French village with lots of quaint houses. It is set on a hill and facing a river, so it is rather scenic, but do be prepared for walking up slopes and stairs. There many good spots for photo taking. The highlight was a house 100% imported from France. It taken apart in France and then reassembled again locally. The other highlight was the muppet show, which was very lively and entertaining. "
Petite France,Perfect tour on a sunny and cool weather during sakura season. Shooting place of Man from the stars and running man. 
Petite France,"Quite a small park, but it was a beautiful place to visit. Wanted to watch the show but the staff was very nice to tell us it will be in Korean and we will not be allowed to leave the place once the show starts. Hence we leave the place without watching the show"
Enjoy the beauty of flowers,Quiet place and lots of flowers. Suitable for relaxing with family and children. The mandatory thing is to buy Strawberry Jumbo fruit with a very sweet and fresh taste.
suitable for kids,"petite france just like the name, is a small version of france. most of the building decorated similar to european building. honestly this place is not suit for a nature lover like me. for kids, this park will be fun with a lots of cute figure and puppets. dont stop if u dont have much time, plus u need to pay the entrance ticket. the only good thing is, they provide a prayer room for muslim but u need to ask the receptionist first or will not be able to find it."
beautiful,"we visit Petite France and morning calm garden on Dec 2017 is very cool weather, beautiful village, different building, street, view and milestones."
Beautiful village ,"Small beautiful village it’s like an open museum.. beautiful hose , building , street , view and milestones .. I would advise tourists to visit this place on the way after they visit Nami Island .. "
Unnecessary Stop ,I don't know why so many people mentioned how interesting and cool this place is. Honestly this place was an utter waste of time. It gave off a cheap feel and everything was so run down. There is nothing to do here and the gift shops felt like everything came from China. If you have no time please skip this place and if you do have time you don't need much time for this place. I felt really cheated that we had to spend time and money here as part of our tour. I didn't see any lifts so only stairs and slopes There are 2 giftshops and 2 food places 
Beautiful Scenery and Art work ,"We visited this place the day after we visited the morning calm and I love it. Some may say it’s a little cheesy however I loved the puppet shows, loved the different buildings you can go in and out of. We took slow strolls over the bridge by the fox statue where the view was spectacular. You can go with the entire family or as a couple. I would not recommend this being a solo trip. It costs about 10000KRW or 10 USD to get in "
Won’t go twice ,"Maybe because it’s summer, it’s just too hot to walk around, up and down the slopes. Joined a tour and honestly, not worth getting up early just to visit the place. Just a well maintained garden filled with French’s stuff. Of course some younger kids may enjoy more than the adults. It could be interesting for some but just thought not worth the trouble to travel there. Limited cafes, think only one there. Can be crowded on weekends. The bus ride for the last 15 min caused some to feel nauseous. The road was quite winding going up the hill. "
Emmm,There are a lot more to see in Seoul other than this place. But depends on ur preferences if u like something that is not about korea in Korea then go. Tq
Cute French Village,"On our way to Nami Island we had a short stop at this themed village. Well known for Korean drama locations Some of them are ""My Love From The Star"", 'Secret Garden"" and "" Beethoven Virus"". Colour buildings with beautiful French architecture. Must go to the wooden deck of petite terrace to get a panoramic view of Cheongoyeiong lake . Some of the interesting places are Butterfly park, European doll house, Antiques flea market, Traditional French house, Fountain square , Pond de Fabre and “Bonjour” walkway.There were some French style houses which provides overnight accommodation. Need to book in advance. Recommend to take a printed map. Short visit is more than enough."
Small and not worth it. Do skip it if you have no time,"Despite the reviews read (not positive ones), I still went to this place with my hub. We missed the city bus and took a cab that cost 18k Won. Very disappointed with the place. Very small and I completed it in 20 mins. Nothing much to view, honestly. And in summer time around afternoon, it was scorching hot. Please skip this place but go to Nami Island and Garden of Morning Calm instead."
OK but out of place,Went as part of a tour that included Garden of Morning Calm and Nami Island so it was bound to lose by comparisons. Had it been 1st rather than 3rd I may have viewed it more favourably but after the garden I felt the time was wasted. I was in Korea so why this boring attempt to capture the flavour of France.
Colourful Little French Town,"We visited this little French Town because we didn't have enough time to visit the Garden of the Morning Calm which is much further in after visiting Nami Island.Having visited Europe a few times, this is just a nice replica for taking pictures, a really small place. The internal tour bus cost 6000 Won brings tourists to different attractions in the area. Got to be mindful of the schedule which is not very regular at certain time period.While this little town is small, we did enjoy the puppet show of Pinocchio where those Korean children were so responsive during the show in Korean. The queue for the show was quite long and the small theatre was full with visitors sitting on the stairs.The open air magic show was another interesting event where the kids really had a good time. The magician was very good at making the kids happy with his bag of tricks.Overall, we had fun here."
Very very small place,"As the title says, don’t be fooled by what is perceived on kdramas/variety! The place is actually small, the whole place can be browsed through in 30mins if you do it in a rush. Place is far off city centre but luckily we got a tour there. You should go there yourself in order to see it for yourself definitely! Cool theme but nothing much to do there except for taking photos."
A Little Colorful French Town,"I think it is better if you book a tour going to Petite France, just so the transportation is easier. From Myeongdong it was like an hour via Bus. You can book a tour to this place along with Nami Island. (but if you are just going to this place only, I don’t really recommend it that much)This place is really Instagram worthy, not to mention if you watched the Kdrama of Jun Ji-hyun and Kim Soo-hyun’s My Love from the Star, you would really want to check this place out. We went in May (Summer Season) so be sure to wear light clothes and just bring a jacket for layering just to be sure, because the weather is unpredictable. Good for a one time visit."
Well... it's a well-kept attraction,"If you're a fan of the Little Prince or a particular Korean drama shot here, a visit here may hold excitement for you. Other than that, it's a charming replica French town in the middle of Korea with nothing else to do except look at curios on display, watch a puppet show or imagine you're in France. This stop is usually packaged with a trip to Nami Island with most tours, which is probably one of the reason it's surviving and relatively well-kept. I would imagine the appeal if you're a local or a really devout K-drama fan doing pilgrimage to different location sites. Other than that, if you can skip it, do so. Your Korean experience will still be complete."
Adorable little town,I would definitely recommend heading here. It's a little out of Seoul. When we went we went on a tour and it was adorable and sweet. Very unique place and a family friendly location
A French experience,I have visited the place several times. This venue is often included in a tour package hence the excitement wears out over time. Nevertheless it is a popular tourist spot and a good place to experience the French atmosphere.
Different Experience,"Came by as part of a day tour. I wasn't sure what to expect. It was a small ""French"" town that you could walk through. You could enter most of the building and there was some information about them. I thought the walk to the lookout was quite nice. It led to a lookout overlooking the river. There were a few interesting things scattered around, like ringing the bell, but it was mostly just walking through buildings. Not much food options here though, mostly snacks."
Over-rated attraction,"A very crowded attraction with lots of tourists. It looked pretty on brochures but it is only an average attraction with nothing much and lots of tourists. It is also pretty small and hence, it only took us less than an hour to complete the whole area. Before visiting this place, I have high expectation of this place but after visiting, it seems not worth it. I prefer the Busan Colourful Village instead of this."
Nami Island over Petite France,"Visited this place last January 2017, i suggest to spend more time in Nami island than here. You can visit this in the morning, drink coffee while enjoying the view, take some pictures, then straight ahead to Nami island."
Dolled-up place but nice,"A feel of France definitely in Seoul! While place is not what I would expect when going to Seoul, kids loved the scenery, show, shops and food. I wouldn’t linger here extensively if Nami and The Garden of Morning Calm are part of your itineraries for the day (which were ours). "
A place to visit if one is a K-drama fan,"Having seen this location on K Drama's and variety shows, It was one of my ""must go"" places on my recent trip to Korea, But in reality, it looks nicer on TV. "
A huge disappointment,"Even if you have never been to France, this place also does not give you the feeling that you are in France. The flowers were so few, just a couple of buildings (almost all were locked) and a few places to buy snacks. The only highlight was the hand puppet performance just right after entrance. Not worth spending your time and money though."
Don’t waste your time,We got taken here as part of a tour to Nami island. It is honestly one of the most bizarre places we have been to. A collection of about 23-30 houses in an ‘apparent’ French style. Not entirely sure what you are meant to do here. It was all very odd
Nothing fantastic ,"Another resort that mimicks European style, but is nothing closer to it. Pretty small place as well. Will not recommend"
Kdrama place,"You might be familiar with this as its featured to some Kdrama like My love from the star. Nothing much to see if you don't catch some of their show. It is near in Nami Island and can be reach by Gapyeong Tourist Bus, just don't lost your ticket as you can use it for whole day."
small french village setting..,"this place might be good for few photos, nothing much else to do..this was part of my trip along with nami island.. you can spend one hour there...the puppet show at the end was worth watching.."
"Know this place because of ""My Love from the Star""",I get to know this place because of K-drama- My Love from the Star. It is French-themed village located about 25 minutes away from Nami Island station by the Gapyeong Tour Bus. We queue up for long waiting for the bus and be prepared as there is a lot of people and you need to stand inside the bus.You can come before evening time where you able to view the night time lights. Here also have puppet show but we only spend around half an hour at here as we need to catch up for the bus to back to Gapyeong station.
Beautiful place to visit during Christmas,"We booked a day tour from Seoul (Nami Island - Gapyeong Rail Park - Petite France) and it’s super worth the trip. It costs about S$200 booked via ChangiRecommends website.This place was the most beautiful. It was apparently built by a rich Korean businessman who was fascinated by the beauty of the small towns in France. The place was beautifully decorated with Christmas deco in December! They even had puppet performances. There were a few small houses to see. Actually we were only allocated 2 hours but i think longer would be better.Food places were limited and mostly crowded. Toilets were available but long queue for the ladies. The only downside is also the crowd. Too many tourists and therefore, hard to take photos. If it were quieter, it would have been so romantic! "
Romantic Getaway,"Visiting this place during winter is definitely intriguing and romantic. Love the resort build up like Colmar France and the outdoor decoration is pretty. There's an antique house where you can view all the France & Europe antiques, beautiful. This is also the film location for Korean Drama My Love from The Star and Beethoven Virus, you can view the rooms and area that they use it for filming. As it was winter during my visit, the snow in the surrounding makes the whole resort even more mesmerizing. "
Made for TV,"This place was created solely for movie setting. There is nothing special or anything that worth seeing. I would rather see some places with true Korean cultural.However, if you do end up visiting this place, there is a very good view - go to the back of the village, up to the 3rd level attic and look out from the window. The view is very good.....mountain, water and village."
Pretty place for photos ,"Visited 13 March Tuesday morning 10am. Lovely place for photo taking. Apart from that there wasn't much to do. The area is small. Apart from the shops selling art and food, there was little activity. You probably need an hour+. We left at 1115a after the puppet show - a short but entertaining one. I would recommend this short stop over enroute to Nami Island just for the photos. :)"
Quaint little but picturesque village,Went on a private tour eurgh family. Pretty little village with loads of photo opportunities. We enjoyed the trip very much. 
40 minutes here ,"Came here by the gapyeong city bus , I only have 40 minutes plus here before the bus returns and fetch us back to Nami island . The place was quite small , but love the colors & atmosphere here . 8000 won for entrance . Got free puppet show when we arrive . The scenery of the mountain and lake here was awesome . "
For extra time ,"It’s near Nami Island. The place is a bit small and you don’t need much time to circle the area. Petit France is okay, if you haven’t been to France. Lower your expectations if you have. "
Another K-Drama Filming Location,"Second stop of the Trazy Tour package is the beautiful Petite France. Famous for being one of the filming location of K-Drama My Love from the Star this place is worth a visit. It miniature of the famous place France has to offer, specifically, Eiffel Tower. The place also has an amphitheater, an alley of restaurants and museum. It offers beautiful spots of photos. We spent more than 2 hours here and enjoyed walking up and down in the multi-colored houses. Highly recommended to tourists, especially K-drama fans."
Nothing extraordinary,"This place in my opinion is quite boring, not much to see, better just visit Nami island and save your time."
"Not much too see, small village ","Petite France is a small replica of French Village. It was used as a place for French people who lived in Korea. Unlike what we saw in movie, this place is really small (petite). It was just like very old village. We only spent 1 hour here because there was nothing to see."
"A must-visit for fans of ""My Love from the Star""","Compared to neighboring attractions like Nami Island and The Garden of Morning Calm, this village is small and can be toured in 1-2 hours. It is worth the visit if you're in the area and you're a K-Drama fan. ""My Love from the Star"" is on top of my K-Drama list so this place is a must-visit for me.3 TIPS WHEN VISITING:1. Come in the late afternoon so you can enjoy views of both the daytime and the nighttime. The colorful lights at night are magnificent!2. This area tend to be crowded, be smart or devious when taking photos so you don't have a lot of other people in the background.3. Bring snacks. There is an area for food that overlooks a good view."
Endearing Little Place,"It's reaaally small but it's a cute place. Best suited for those KDrama fans and instagramable ^^. Dedicated for French Novel, author of 'My little Prince' (Le Petite Prince). If you read it, maybe you'll find this place endearing (or not worthed ha3). When the visitor still few, taking photos at good spot are comfortable. But when it start to crowded, better explore it. There's a mini galleries & beautiful mural, inside it."
Come only when you have lots of time to spend,Nothing much to see. Felt it's a waste of time coming here. The only thing nice about the scenery is probably the one you see here. Many from the tour group returned to the tour bus much earlier than the appointed time.
take a lot of photos here,"actually this is a stopover inn/hotel.located near nami island, usually a package.nothing much to do here.but it gives a good photospot, some famous k-drama shooting location, a good ambience and relaxing spot with lovely one.not to crowded."
Not only for kids ,"The Little Prince is one of my favorite books. I’ve read it many times over and everytime I read it I learn something new and it still gives me excitement. So after our Nami tour, our next destination is the Petite France. I got so excited when I saw the Statue of the Little Prince. It was like stepping into a 3 D book. As I was visiting the place, I was wondering how the developer would interpret each character in the book. And in fairness and in my honest opinion Petite France did justice. The highlight of this tourist spot for me is taking a selfie at the planet, ringing the bell tower and watching the ending of the korean novela “my love from the stars” . We were right on the same spot where the korean drama was shot. I make believe I was in a small village in France visiting the neighborhood. We entered each of the french houses and got a glimpse of french culture through the interior of the houses. I saw plenty of hand painted roses, and other handmade paintings. We climbed up the highest part of the small village and took picture of the colorful houses down below. It was a beautiful sight. Every so often You will see quotes from the Little Prince written on walls and all over the place. I am not in my teens anymore but I enjoyed the place. It is not only for kids but young at heart as well. "
nothing to be excited about,"...after visiting Nami Island, Petite France was the next stop of the Island Bus so we went inside with an KRW 8000 entrance fee. There was really nothing much to see in this area, just a mini version of what the south of France is with some illuminations and Christmas decorations. NOT really a MUST see though. :) An hour walking around would be enough already :)"
Nothing much,"Outside view was indeed picturesque overlooking mountains and hilly view covered with snow. Other than that, it was a so-so experience for me. Nothing much. Really."
"Great Place To Experience France, Love It!","We have been to France before but then we came here, we definitely fall in love with the place. Nice setting of France in the middle of upcoming winter season. Love the way the theme park is arranged...you can see the house, relax & chill as well as take photos. However, if you just want to come here all the way from Seoul then it might be worthwhile. You should plan to visit Nami Island in the morning & after lunch take the Shuttle Bus to visit Petite France in the afternoon."
Love this place! :),I just love this place and it was the first place I visited upon arrival in Seoul! I wished I visited it in the morning to enjoy more of its quaint surroundings. <3Little Prince lovers will have a field day here. :)
Not worth a special trip,"Just a place to take some photos, not worth a special trip from seoul. But if you are in the area after visiting nami island or the gapyeong rail park, you can stop by to visit since there are all within the same area."
Along the way to Nami Island and Morning Calm,"This place is along the way between Nami Island and Morning Calm. Buy the bus ticket from Gapyeong terminal, it gives you unlimited ride for one day between destinations. If you have time left after Nami and Morning Calm, its a good little place to visit. See the attached map and timetable"
Nothing special,Seriously you can just skip this place..nothing special down here..just like a dwarf city..and why should we go to this place when we visits korea?right?
Colorful,This place can be reached by a bus from Gapyeong station. You buy a ticket for 6000 won and you can ride the bus unlimited going to Nami island stop and Petite France stop. Petite France is just along the road.
Nothing like France,Just a small French cultural place where you don't eat French food and nothing much to see. If you ever go you just need 60 minutes or so since it is a tiny place. It would be a good getaway from Seoul if you combine this place with like Nami Island or the garden of morning calm. 
Cute but not that exciting in the winter ,"For those who love The Little Prince storybook or Korean romantic dramas, this village offers some cute photo ops, and has displays of traditional French furniture, toys, instruments and porcelain. However, in the cold, grey winter it loses a bit of its charm on the relatively isolated mountain. Do go there if you can as a part of a group tour or a shuttle bus trip, but remember that it'll only take around two hours to explore everything. The puppet show was fun! Food is mediocre at best with no real restaurants available. DRESS WARMLY."
Cute little village ,"There were performances in the street, a wonderful backdrop to take pictures with. A nice restaurant serving a delectable meals. Nice to bring kids especially if they had read Little Prince."
It was Ok,It's a small replica of a French village and good enough for photos. But I recommend coming here only if you have extra time or if you're a really big fan of Kdrama. 
Quaint,"Has been of South Korea's favourite filming location. If you enjoy artifacts, French type performances, reminiscing scenes from Korean Dramas, you will enjoy this place. I kind of expected much more though and especially more French food or desserts instead of local ones. Its supposed to be a French village.The direction to the place is in the picture. Just skip the 'Nami Island' portion. You can use the same tour bus ticket after Nami to go to Petite France. It will be a winding road as its located on the mountain area.The tour bus runs on timing. So plan well.There are Guest Houses too."
Mini museum with many photo spot,"You will spend arround 2 hours in this place.. and many photo spot in here.. there was also some performance and mini museum.. but if you go by bus, the queue is like a mess.. they cannot speak english and the spot to queue can be replace.. the bus is not ontime.."
A sweet place!,"We were greeted with a statue of The Little Prince at the entrance of this attraction and upon entering, we heard some music and laughter as we almost missed the Marionette show which was enjoyable and fun. It was nice to walk around and explore the place, with all the European artifacts and antique displays, there is really that vibe of like being in France.This a good place to visit with the whole family."
Replica of France,"Great of fan of the book ‘The Little Prince’. Display of the owners collection. Nice collect of dolls, puppets, paintings, etc. Good stop over if you are going to Nami island from seoul. Good place for photos. "
Great place for little prince lover,"This place is great for little prince lover, because you can find some statue of the little prince which similar with the book illustration. You can also visit Antoine de Saint-Exupéry hall which is full with the book illustration. There are some little museum and puppet show you can enjoy too."
Don't Go Out Of Your Way To See,"Don't go out of your way to see this place. It's okay but not really out if the ordinary to visit on its own. Only visit it if you have time or if it is included in a tour or if you are really into Korean dramas. The length of time to go to the place is also not worth it. The place itself is very small that it would take you less than an hour to see everything. If you are there anyway, try catching the shows they have. I saw the marionette show and it was entertaining."
Visit if you have spare time!,"I booked a whole day tour and this was the first stop of our tour. This place is a Little France with the theme of Little Prince, it's not a very big area and will take you mostly an hour and a half to walk through it. I must say that this is a nice place for taking pictures, with the colorful buildings, flowers and view of mountains and lakes. Otherwise, walking into the buildings and looking at the interior of the houses isn't really special for me. If you are a big fan of Korean drama, you will get excited being here since ""My Love from the Star"" took some scenes here and they also showed you the room where the actress rested.I feel like this is an ok attraction, come here if it is included together in a tour but don't bring too much expectations!"
Not attractive & not worthwhile to make a special trip here.....,"As what the other reviewers said, this is an attraction; not a restaurant. Can Trip Advisor please correct this?The place is quite small. It attempts to replicate a French village, highlighting its culture through buildings, history & lifestyle.Ok, it looked nice to a certain extent. But frankly it is not very interesting & not worth coming here if time is limited. It is also quite far from the city.We came here because it was part of the bus route package attractions which covers few attractions. But definitely not worth the time & entrance fee if you are just coming for this place alone"
Skip It,"I suspect this is a stop on offer as a filler on the way to Nami Island. I’d rather go directly to Nami Island. Makes no sense except as a wanna be European town that is a poor replica. I know, I live in Europe. "
Le Petit France,"The place is little France. Not much to do, just roam around, take pictures and smell the air. Not that impressive but it does not disappoint."
"Not worth the time, price nor effort","This was the last stop of the day tour that included Nami Island, Garden of Morning Charm, and of the 3 locations, this is the worst.Firstly, it is a small place of pretty tired looking ""French"" buildings. Though each building houses some displays, it is nothing spectacular or immersive. Even the guide for the day tour mentioned that this place was not popular and had few visitors until it was made popular because of some K-dramas being filmed there.There are a couple of spots where I would agree, make quite nice photography locations, other than that, it is not worth the time nor effort to make a stop here.The group had 1.5 hours here, I left after 30mins, and thats inclusive of time for toilet break and waiting in line for buying coffee."
Journey to petite France ,The place is small and nice looking. Looks good on photo. It's takes about less than an hour to make its round of the whole area. The bus journey there is about half and hour and it it winding road and up hill and down hill. Journey is tough and place of interest is small not worth the visit. 
Eiffel tower fails to impress,"The name of the place conveys how miniaturized France would look like to those who have travelled to Europe and other places where a miniature of a country would look like: consider Disney World with its ""countries"" inside the amusement park. But that would be unfair comparison. Just saying.The place is not senior or disable friendly. The walk to the main attraction is steep and someone with knee problems (as I had during the visit) would have to literally crawl to get in Once inside there is not much to see, except for some French characters you could thrust your face into, the minisculre Eiffel tower and a facsimile of what a French village should look like. Even the croissants need some buttering.But it would do if you cannot go to Europe, then Petite France is a place to see if you're already in Seoul anyway."
"Meet Little Prince at Petite France, French Village in Korea","Petite France is located in Gapyeong-gun, Gyeonggi-do. You can come here by subway and drop off at Gpyeong Station, then take ""The Shuttle Bus for Gapyeong Tourist Resort"" (Hop-on, Hop-off Bus) to Petite France (and also to Namiseom, Jaraseom, The Garden of Morning Calm). A lot of French style buildings are located in a perfect site which is on the hill. So you can see a very beautiful scenery of Changpyeong Lake. This is a popular filming site of many famous K-Drams & Movies."
Need serious maintenance,Booked a day tour to visit Nami Island and here. This place is small and can be covered in less than half an hour. Swarm of bees and insects congregated in some of the rooms. Gone were the beautiful flowers. Now is the start of the autumn but there is practically no flowers. Would suggest the management for an overhaul. Walls and exhibits were stained. Even the spectator seats were very dirty. Lack of places to sit thus won't suggest elderly to come.
Lovely quaint place!,"We had visited Petite France on our way to Nami Island and it was a quaint little place. Not much to do there except photo taking and my kids; 4 year old and 6 year old, were happily running all over this place.Ticket entrance is not expensive and generally, a nice stopover."
"Family place , relaxing, great for kids","Petite France interprets a small city with little houses that showcases some antiques collection, puppets stories, and even car collectibles. The place is quite nice, also have a building that can overlook the entire Seoul city. There is a puppet dancing show starting 2pm as well. The lady who masters the dancing puppet is really good. Kids love it. The only down thing is the food choices here is little. "
A little French in Korea,"You couldn't tell if it's on Korea or french village. This is an unique village build in Korea. The houses used to lives by French diplomats long ago, now it's used for exhibits and tourist area. I'm taking lots for pretty pictures here. "
Not worth it,"My adult daughter and I toured this early October and were sadly disappointed. Some French furniture and architecture, but many of the things in the antique place looked like they had been purchased at a hobby store here in the USA. No shows scheduled when we were there, bathrooms would not be very accessible for anyone with a physical handicap. I wouldn’t waste my time. There are so many more lovely places to visit in Korea. Don’t waste your money unless you just want to blow 8,000 won per person. "
Not worth the admission fees :-(,"We stopped here after visiting Nami Island. This place is run down, with very little to see. Most of it looks a lot like thrift stores form the US. Some of the stuff was French, but not all. The gift stores sold a confusing array of things, from Bart Simpson dolls, to replicas of the Eiffel tower. The snack and food places all had the same food, none of it French. No shows were due to start in the hour and a half we had. Disappointing for the price we paid to get in. If it had cost less I would not be as upset that we stopped here. For a group of 4 that is 36,000 won. I would have rather taken pictures of the outside from the coffee shop across the street and saved that money."
Fairytales Village in Gapyung ,Great place for kids and romantic coupleYou can enjoy The performance show like Maim and Marionette.
Overly hyped up,"Personally think this place has been overly hyped up by travelers... it’s rather small, nothing much to see and doesn’t even look as nice as on TV. If you still plan on visiting, please don’t set too high expectations. Also the Gapyeong bus shuttle service does not have very clear guide on the direction of the service it is heading to. We were heading to Petite France from Nami Island but a whole bunch of us waited at the wrong direction of the shuttle service. There should be clear signs and queueing system. So do check before you head up the bus. "
Little France at Seoul,Spend 2 hours here before/after you visit Nami Island.Just a small place but worth to visit especially if you travel with kids.Beautiful place to take some pictures.
For Little Prince lovers,"If you love the Little Prince, this is quite a treat. It lets you appreciate the characters of the book as well as get to know the author better. The other areas are great additions - french art, antiques, dolls (cool collection across the decades) etc.Tip: Check the schedule of shows to maximize your visit and map your walk strategically"
Not as glamorous as on TV shows,Not as glamorous as on TV shows. Maybe my expectations were high. I was disappointed. I wouldn't travel all the way there for this. But there are other places at Gapyeong-gun worth visiting. 30 minutes is all it takes to walk around the area.
A colourful window to France !!,"First thing first , its a tourist spot and not a restaurant located close to nami island. Its a theme area based on culture of France. The name itself means little France ! This place is so vibrant and beautiful. Very good for photography. The view from the top is gorgeous! It has many antique display houses and souvenir shops. There is a cafeteria inside this place. This place is also famous for a Korean drama ' my love from the star' which was shot here."
beautiful place to take a pic,this place is small but very beautiful. they also got small coffee house but closed at the time we arrived there. all the way up here is beautiful just beside the lake. just perfect.
Just for the hype...,"Honestly maybe i had a high expectation of the place due to running man and other Kdrama and KvarietyShows .. But the place is not that big and nothing much going on there . Its worth a one time visit, but i wouldn't be going back again. For the first time it would be an awesome reminiscence the corners that is familiar through the screen . The hall that had the signature was a bit too simple if u asked me.. but interesting... If only it had some more variety of cafe/vendors/carts as such open where people can chill and sit and enjoy the view would be best.. But We took a tour that had an hour to spend here which was more than enough for us .. =)"
Of K Drama Fame,"The place is nice for a quick visit. It is small enough to finish in 1 hour. Very nice and colorful buildings and pathways for photo taking. If you are visiting the surrounding sights such as Nami Island or Rail Park, definitely swing by to visit this piece of tiny France."
"Rundown, Unexciting","This is not a restaurant, it is a tourist destination offered on tours.We were a family of 4, rented a car and drove here.Bottom line - do not waste your time here. Entrance fee is 6000won/person which could be spent better elsewhere.Meant to have a French feel - buildings look dated and like they needed a fresh coat of paint.Absolutely nothing to do there aside from visiting a few antique shops.Atrocious food options - 2 cafes service tokbokki, frozen pizza, cold drinks and coffee."
Running Man Fan,"I put this place in my list after watching Running Man, and my love from the star (K-drama). I enjoy the colorful buildings and the performance. Other than this, I find everything less interesting."
Cuteness overload!,"Petite France is a French cultural Village 25-minute ride from Nami Island. It is a unique theme park outside the city of Seoul. Also well known as The little Prince theme park, it has 16 French-style buildings with guestrooms that can accomodate up to 200 guest. Each building has a different theme. Such a cute place! Ticket prices are:  – Adults: 8,000 won – Teenagers : Individual 6,000 won – Children : 5,000 won"
Miss its mark,"This is a French imitation theme park, unfortunately except for the performance (pantomime etc) it missed the mark by wide margins. Buildings not maintained well, inside stale and dusty, food are Korean and not French, and expensive. "
Interesting place,"Interesting place if you are one of the below 1. a fan of ""The Little Prince"" 2. has kids 3. Would like to visit the fairytale land featured in korean dramas/ running man. 4. Like to take picturesThe place showcases the traditional houses, furniture, ornament and decoration from France. Stay for the puppet show if you are there! The puppeteer makes the puppets come to life!"
Summer @Petite France,"Visited Petite France in end Jun. It was scorching hot that day at about 1-2pm. Couldn't take many pictures of myself there due to the hot and bright sun. But definitely a colourful place for pictures taking. A filming site for ""My Love from the Stars"" if you are a K drama addict."
Colourful place,"If you go to Nami island,don't skip Petite France. .usually if you go by tour,as me,i take Nami island package with Petite france and railbike..via Funtastic Korea.It's a small place but quite unique..colourful and tiny buildings..you can take lot of pictures here."
Petite ,Very beautiful small village that is owned by a person how loves to collect things from France.. Very beautiful and organized .. You would fee like you are in France.. Many good place to take pictures in them and to enjoy watching the small houses and the rooms with intact furniture.. Good place to take your child with you to.. It would take about an hour to see everything.. There are also there are good shop stores
Interesting BUT,"Really, everything revolves about ""The Little Prince"". However, if you're not a fan, and if you're not with kids, better to skip this place or spend little time here. We enjoyed the view but not much, as it's just man-made and nothing very special. Not much quaint cafes inside too where we can linger and chill. So while waiting for the rest of our group, some of us went out and ""chilled"" at the convenience store across the road and ate fresh strawberries sold by the street vendor. Sweet! That's the better bargain."
A sightseeing place only.,"There's nothing much to do in here but the place is beautiful. The buildings are so colorful and artsy. Also, be sure to catch the performances available. Hand Puppet show is really interesting."
Pretty,"Quaint, pretty and cozy, albeit its small size. 1-2 hours is enough for a visit. Great view of the surrounding area. Lots of beautiful backdrops for photo taking. Clean and well maintained, with enough facilities. Performances are available at certain times. There are better similar places other than Petite France elsewhere, but it is still unique in its own way."
Little France in Seoul,"What a pleasant surprise to have this place in Seoul , its like being transported in some quaint town / village in Europe . Its not only France , there were other European artworks on display , the architecture is reminiscent of Europes warmth... beautiful to visit and behold ... worth the visit "
Relaxing View,"This place offers a lot of indoor display.It's living to it's name petite France, They have Pitite Eifel Tower, Petite Display and Small houses that exhibit different arts. Best to go if you went to nami Island. It takes you a glimpse of how Paris looks like. If you enjoy taking good pictures you might want to visit this place.An advice if your a foreigner they offer a discount of 2,000 won just print it from their site and show your passport."
Quaint place with many photo taking opportunities,"Visit here only if you are on your way to or from Nami Island. As picturesque as it may be, it's not worth travelling all the way for just this one place. You can easily finish visiting this place in 1.5 hrs. There are many quaint French styled houses to peek into and take pictures of. There are even lodging. I bet it must be kinda cool to stay there for a few nights. Some places to get deserts and of course coffee."
"Nice,Relax and interesting to visit this place","this place is nice and comfortable. Petite France describes a French Town. Korean reality show like Running Man play in here. If you love photography, this place is nice to take a photo. You can see so many an old item from France. There is a guest house in here. Hehe. Overall you must visit this place if you go to Seoul."
Pretty place,"Quite inconvenient to get there, have to take a ITX train (different from KTX) and you can get a hop on and off bus that travels to nami island as well (it is pricey though so ensure you make the most out of it). Quite crowded so you may have to queue for picture spots. Have lunch before as well."
just an average,"Nothing too special for this place. The view is just OK, children will not really enjoy this place, so not recommended if you have kids woth you. This place is for couples or group of friends who love to take pictures."
Beautiful road trip ,"Well, my expectations were a little too high for Petite France. At a little over an hour's drive from Seoul, this was a nice road trip. If you want a curvy trip around a beautiful lake, head out there. Petite France has a small coffee shop or two that has basic snacks. Plenty of stairs or paths to wander around the small park. A few hodge-podge museums to look around. If you are a fan of The Little Prince, you will enjoy the location . If you are scared of puppets or clowns, steer clear. "
Leisure,Not worth the trip. Just some french houses and nothing. The service at both cafe are poorThe only cold drink they sell is strawberry smoothie. Do not waste your time and money to come here.. 
nice n interesting place to visit,this is a nice and interesting place to visit.it is suitable for kids and adults too.can spend 1-2 hours here.don't miss out the show.
"Small village, very commercialised","Petite France is a small village made to look like a French town. It is famous for being the filming site of some Korean dramas. The village makes for a good photo spot, but that's about it. There isn't much to do there other than simply walking around and visiting some of the souvenir shops. I only spent about 30min there."
Nice atmosphere ,"It is a nice attraction in the middle of beautiful nature The buildings and the nature around so nice for photosYou dont need more than an hour there, it needs to be within a package."
A Nami island side trip,"Since we had time left from our Nami tour, we visited this place.From Nami Island port, we took the Bus and it was a 30 minutes ride. Entrance Fee is 8,000 korean won. The place was just okay. My friend insisted going here because she was a fan of Running Man tv show, and there is one episode that was shoot here. You can enter and explore every house. Each house has its theme and uniqueness.If your main plan is Nami Island, below is the direction.Direction & Cost (Fastest and stress free way):1. Take ITX train from Seoul Station to Gapyeong Station. Travel time is 45 minutes. Cost: around 10,700 korean won for a round trip. I advise to make your reservation at least the night before on their website then claim the ticket on the station. I also advise that you take the 7:00 am trip, and I will tell you that waking up early will be worth it. Train leaves on time, so make sure you are already seated on your assigned seat at 6:59 am.Tip: train car number is written on the stepping platform. Look for the ITX sign and your number.2. Their are two ways to get to the Port from Gapyeong Station.First is by Bus, there is a bus going rounds on all the tourist spot on the area. But it has a timetable when it will arrive on a specific bus stop. Sometimes it takes at least 30-45 minutes of waiting. See attached pictures for reference. Cost: 5,000 to 6,000 korean won for a 1 day tourist pass (unlimited bus ride to any tourist spot on the area).Second is by Taxi, if you don't want to wait in line and for the bus, I advise you to take the taxi. Anyway, it is just a 5 -8 minutes ride going to the Port. We took the taxi, as we don't want to waste time waiting, then we just split the bill. Cost: 3,800 korean won. 3. Once you have arrived at the port, there are two ways to get to the island.First is by Zip Line, if you are looking for a thrill and adventure then try it. It is about 2 minutes zip line from the port to the Island. Cost: 38,000 korean won. Inclusive of the ferry transportation going back to the port from Namin Island.Second is by Ferry, we took the ferry going to the Island because of the weather. We didn't dare to take the zip line as the weather was so cold. It was 2 degrees that time. Cost: 8,000 korean won for a round trip.We spent almost 2 hours on this place. We leave at 4:30 to catch our 6:00pm scheduled ITX train."
Not Worth It,"Normally, when going of coming from Nami Island, people will visit this place. The place is very small and not that impressive. The entrance fee and the time you will spend is not worth it."
"So-so, too small","Nothing really special about this petite France, as the title stated, it is really petite. Getting to this place is not easy unless one is driving.There are some nice buildings and places to roam but overall, it is too small.Probably spending more time @ Morning Calm and Nami Island would be better."
Fun & Interesting,"1st time to visit this small village during winter and with my 2 girls. First time also to go with a group tour.The place is just small but very interesting as it is European inspired. So many instagrammable areas to take photos from. If you are a fan of Little Prince, this place would be more fun and exciting. There are parts though where you have to go uphill to reach a certain spot. There's a puppet show, souvenir shops, cafes where you can relax. There's even this piece of cloth where you complete a certain number of stamps to be able to redeem a postcard. We had so much fun.Would recommend to others to visit. Once would be okay."
An hour is not enough for art lovers.,"You can clearly see a viewtiful little France-like community just coming from the highway of Goseong-ri. Colorfully painted roof and houses. The place was full of creative artifacts, (from household wares to furnitures), paintings, and home decorations. If you are an art lover like me, you would surely enjoy the place and an hour is not enough to examine the intricate details of some eccentric designs found in this place."
Stopover after Nami Island,"We came to this place after visit Nami, by a tour bus that circling around. Some small houses surrounding this place, house of antique furniture, house of music etc. There are not much stuff to explore, you can skip it.."
Just a quick stop,"We came to this place in the noon after visit nami, by tour bus that circling around several tourist spot.It's showering rain after we arrive. So there's not much to see, because mostly outdoor.Some small house surrounding this place, house of old france porcelains, house of antique furniture, house of music.Couple of korean drama took place in this area.Not much to see, just take some pictures and leave. I think once is enough."
It was fine ,You don't need to stay for more than 30 minutes Don't expect much but you will like the view from up there 
I rather skip,We stopped in here because we purchased tourist shuttle bus for our transport to nami. It was raining. Not much place to eat but little shop selling beverages and quick bites.Its more to museum showing antique things. If you have lots of time...you can have a quick visit....not must place to visit
"Lousy, waste $, waste tine","Small, nothing much. Not worth to come at all. 8k is very expensive. You can finish here within 30mins."
Small place but it's good location to take photo,It's small place with walking around to take some photos. Recommend not to stay too long at this place to avoid delay if there is schedule for next destination like Namiseom island or rail bike.
Little France...,"Petit France is small town of France. It is nice place to take lots of family photos such as corridor with mountain view, long walking bridges, colorful building, etc. However, if you have limited of travel time, you can skip this place to other electrified places."
Skip if you don't have time,"If you are making a day trip to Gapyeong and you don't have enough time, skip this place. It's quite a disappointment and waste of time. "
A taste of France!,"This small French themed park consists of museum, workshops, restaurants, cafe and a guesthouse. It was also featured on several Korean dramas like my all-time favorite Secret Garden and My Love from the Stars. What makes it even more special is the whole concept of this village revolves around the Little Prince. There's even a memorial hall dedicated to Saint Exupery, the author of the novel, The Little Prince. There's also the Marionette Performance to liven up the crowd. No one is too old to be in a fairyland. ❤ This place is very close to Nami Island, popular because of the drama Winter Sonata, but we'd rather pay a visit when the pine trees get back to life already. We filled our always-hungry-tummies at a restaurant near the ferry port."
Nice Small European Complex,The place is not too big but quite enough to feel we are at European/Paris atmosfer.Nice for walking and relaxation.
Boring,"There is nothing to do here.. nothing to eat. Needed to travel 25 min by city bus from Nami Island. Definitely not worth it.. needed to pay admissions as well. Tourists went because there was a Korean series that was filmed there, or they wanted to make another stop since they're in the area. Wouldn't go back ever."
Only if you are a fan,"About two hours drive from Seoul , this tiny attraction is an oddity constructed with French elements i.e. replicated an old French street with houses, interiors of houses recreated with original furnishings and decorative items from France, a old building or two was actually uprooted from France and put together here. You can go into the buildings but not touch the exhibits. It's not a French village recreated because its just replicated homes on steep slopes. There is no French bakery,cafe or restaurant which you would expect as the French is so very known for their cuisine. There is a unimpressive gift shop and small cafe with not French food.The tour guide was more keen on telling us about the Korean dramas filmed on this location and where the scenes were shot but not being Korean drama fans we failed to appreciate. The positive side is it is pretty with the colorful houses, we thought it would be beautiful if snowing or lit up at night. Plenty good photo/selfie spots. And you may like the place if you are a fan of all things French...especially antique plates. There is just not much to do and see here. "
A small French village ,Well known for some k drama scenes. But I'm more intrigue with the colours and the plates and little figurines they have. A colorful place to take photos.
Good place ,We go there using gapyeong tourist bus. Petite france is little france in korea. Inside there have mini eiffel tower u can take photo.
Theme Park ,Little France in Korea. Couple hours from Seoul using Gapyepng Tourist Bus. Visit on February in winter season
A place for nice photograph and more photograph,"Really lots of tourist even during winter. Visit Korea Commitee may still have discount coupon when you are reading this so make sure you check their website and print ONE for EACH PERSON. (Not 1 for whole group/couple)This place is really small. If you run you will finish it in less than 30mins. Many cultural stuff about france olden times and some history stuff on france and previous TV series but if you have never watch them before or no interest in such cultural and history stuff this place will be boring.Despite this potential ""boredom"", this is a good place to have nice photograph. It is a photogenic location and mostly will spend 1-2 hours here is mainly because of the time taken to take the photos. The food here is nothing special and expensive like another touristy spot, if you are not starving I recommend you eat at your next location."
Pretty Little Place,"If you love to watch Running Man, then you'll know this place from few episodes of Running Man. The place is very cute, with cute little details, and very artsy too. The place took inspiration from The Little Prince. But when I went there it's kinda overcrowded, although it is a really cold day when I went there. But if you don't have too much time in Seoul, I don't think that this place is that worth the time. Nothing you can actually do here besides taking pictures and enjoying the scenery."
Good for those who likes museum,The things is that some koreans are manic of france and built a place that looks like in the france... Many dolls france made and some of novel.. This place is good for taking picture cause the building are identic from france.... Winter season are reccomended 
Underwhelmed,"Like it's name ""Petite"" this place is small for REAL. I visited during winter and luckily the Christmas feel is present. But unfortunately it does not feel like you are in France at all. Even the fake Eiffel Tower is so petite, it feels like a joke. Overall like other reviewer said, you only need about 30 minutes to stroll around and you've seen it all. This place is extremely photogenic but nothing much to look at besides few cute French look-a-like building and their homey feeling. The scenery outside Petite France is beautiful in Winter though. You can see the snowy landscape and the mountain. "
France in south korea,"Must visit here, the scenery of building is very beautiful, have many attraction to see, a must come if you cone to south korea"
Pretty little place but nothing much to see,"We went on the hop on/hop off bus to visit this place. Place was pretty and magical of the Little Prince story and some Disney princess props for picture taking. However, there is not a lot to see. We were out of this attraction after half an hour. This place is great for kids to enliven their fantasy"
Colorful but feels like a big Gimmick,My wife and I spent about 2 hours in Petite france. It was a very colorful place but it all felt like a gimmick. There were french themed stuff and Little Prince themed stuff but it all felt weird visiting this place while in Korea. You are probably better off skipping this place if you're pressed for time.
Typical Tourist Trap,Went in to take some photos and scroll around the place. Only spend 30 mins there as there is nothing much to see. Typically tourist trap.
Quick Tour Before Going to Nami,"This was our first stop among the three places we have been in Gapyeong. Good choice to be the first stop because there is a longer queue by afternoon. The place is not as big as the Garden of Morning Calm so an hour may be enough to explore the entire place. People who like taking pictures will enjoy this place since there are a lot of spots for photo ops. Not much choices for food but you can grab a quick bite at a convenience store across the street. Or if your hunger can wait, you can have more dining options at the Garden of Morning Calm. "
Scenic location.,"We went in winter, and happened that it snowed that day. So the place really did have a European Winter sort of feel. It made for good photos. Didn't get a chance to see the shows, but the displays of European culture and history, in particular the houses and the furnishings, was interesting."
High Expectation leads to disappointment,"I went to Nami Island and Petite France on same day. Both location is quite near and can access by bus. This place is known as little France however nothing is impressed me. The place looks old and ordinary for me. Entrance fee cost 8,000 KRW which i think is not worth after visiting. Nothing much French decorations inside and the place is quite small. A very short sight seeing destination if you got no place to go. Quite boring for me. There also have a short performance at evening time."
Theme park for kids and lovers,"Not really petite France but an interesting park where you see a variety of themes. You may also rent an apartment and stay overnight to enjoy some evening shows. Easy walking around the park and be sure you follow the schedules for different shows, worth watching."
Boring and Short Visit,Not really a must to go but if you want to capture pictures of colourful miniature buildings just like in France you may want to visit this place to capture the moments. 
Petite France,Could do more to make the attraction more lively; such as live performances or costume parade. Otherwise its just like an outdoor French museum. Was unable to appreciate most of the displays as most of the information were in Korean. 
Petite France,"A quaint little park for a quick visit and photo opportunity while travelling from Nami Island to The Garden of Morning Calm. If you are those would do not dwell on the interior designs of 18th century French living, a 90 minutes visit should suffice. Definitely have plenty of photo ops. For those who are trying to squeeze in 3 location to visit in one day, including Nami Island and Garden of Morning Calm, leave more time for the Garden as it is a bigger place to walk around. Also do note the crowd for when you plan to leave as there may be a queue for the Gapyeong City Tourist Shuttle bus. The bus may run a little late, but the interval is rather long. You definitely do not want to miss the bus for the time you planned for. "
Part of one day trip,"The last stop of our one day trip. If u into Korean drama and running man, u will know this place. A small area with cute building and shop, just for walking around nothing else."
Come around sunset and be bedazzled.,"Enchanting lights surrounded the village after dark. After Nami island we didn't wait for our hourly hop-on hop-off bus so we took the white taxi to Petite France; costs 19,000Won, winding road about 20mins of fast driving. Arrived just around sunset 515pm and was bedazzled by the bright colorful lights.Small French themed village with some interesting rooms. No more shows. We took lots of photos and hang-around about one and a half hour.We have paid for the HoHo bus from Gapyeong station and thankfully the last bus came at 650pm,already very dark, to pick us up.The taxi men were saying no more bus and was offering 18000Won price to take us back to the train station."
Little to see,"There is hardly any food option or place to sit down for a drink in the park. Unless you really have extra time, just skip this place"
A beautiful villages in Korea.,"I went here with my two best friends in order to take some photos that we wanted to post on Face book, so we wore the new clothes bought from Korea, and brought our cameras. We went here in 4 p.m that day, after we take the subway then we should take one hour shuttle bus that we just arrived Petite France, but the open hour was till 5:30 p.m, we were hurry! Only we have 30 minutes to let us take photos and see the views here. At that time there were also some people stay here. Here such as a beautiful village that I have never seen. The views were good.It is great at all but I think it can let the open hour longer and the admission fee can be cheaper so it may attract more travelers to come to visit this pretty place."
Colorful,You can go to Nami island by ferry only 5-10 mins after visit Petite France. Require a lot of climbing stairs so for senior citizen is a quite tiring activity. But the view is nice and can have a coffee during the visit. there is a show as well.
Nice to do ,"Just about average as it does not deserve a very good. You will always combine it with nami island , don't keep more than 1 HR for it. Small village where French homes and milieu has been erected really but nothing outstanding Except of course the puppet show which happens in the amphitheatre every hour I guess ( I saw it at 2 ). Very impressive and your kids will love you "
Quite ordinary,"Petite France is a French-style theme park in Gyeonggi Province. There are numerous buildings and indoor decorations providing a French experience. However, they look quite ordinary and is likely to appeal to someone who has never travelled to Europe/ France. Similar to the Jade Garden which also imitates an European style, it is one of those places that the S. Koreans build to provide an European experience without the need to travel overseas."
"Seriously, don't go here.","Instead of coming here, take your 8,000 KRW and light it on fire. The brief warmth and bright light it will provide you, however brief, is much more enjoyable than any time spent here.Or if you have kids and want to take cute pictures of them, you could come here and have lots of cute photos to share."
Better than i expected,"Was an ""optional"" for me as I've been to several of this style place in Korea and Japan, but pleasantly surprised the place is much bigger than I thought. Great for taking photos and spending a relaxing 2 hours esp if you are on a romantic date! Arrived at 12+, not many people, and hordes of tour buses arrived around 2+/3+, making photo taking much more difficult. I'll recommend adding this to your itinerary if you have time!"
Don't bother,"Nothing impressed me in this place. From the entrance, everything looked old and worn. They need to upgrade and renovate this place. Don't waste your time here. It just looks good in picture."
"Nice, but it looks old","It's nice place, but I Guess it's time to do some renovation. Famous for tourist, since some of Korean series scenes was taken here. "
So much wasted potential!!,"The entrance fee was expensive for what it was ( 8,000W) situated in the middle of no where. There are local buses which comes about every 30 minutes to an hour. You can also take a taxi from the train station and it will cost roughly 17,000W. There is nothing else in the location, and the surrounding restaurants are extremely overpriced. For a simple bibimbap it was 30,000W. There are options to go with tour groups, but they are usually over priced, reaching up to 90,000W for a round trip. Its best to make your own way there, its not hard to reach from Seoul via Subway ( although its over 2 hours)The place itself was more than disappointing. You can see the whole place in less and an hour. Although the buildings are beautifully coloured and mimics European architecture, most of the buildings are locked and Empty/unused. There are a few antique store for you to look at ONLY. Various galleries which either display destroyed paintings, 4-5 pieces of possible french sculptures ( which have very few differences) , and amateur photos of park. There are a few cafes which sells junk food and lacks in options. There are also countable sculptures from ""The Little Prince' and a few other animations. There were so many tourists here, probably made famous by the use of K-dramas actor, but unless thats something that interests you, its not worth the effort out there..."
A very nice Little place to visit .,"Our first day of tour , they took us there after breakfast , when we arrived there were lot of ppl , and tour buses , Its was a very nice to wall around lot of scenery small Gardens with beautiful plants . great for pic taken ,the lake and mountain near by it was nice !!."
Short sight-seeing trip,"Took the shuttle bus to Petite France. Remember to print out discount coupons online for a cheaper entry ticket. We had a short walk-about in there.There were exhibitions and performances. It was nice but will not make you go ""wow."""
Interesting,It takes you to another world with all the colorful building and structures. Worth a visit when you go to Seoul.
Quite,"Is far away from the Seoul city, it's quite but nothing too too much to see. The place isn't too big. You can take a lot of pictures there, all tourist seems to like to travel there. You can plan something more to do if you decide to go here. (Rail park or No island) for a day trip."
Petite & colourful estate!,"I quite like Petite France, it is relaxing & quiet. The houses is very pretty & delicate. I do enjoy walking around taking photos & had enjoy the puppet show. Very entertaining."
Just go by and checked out,"Not that great, ordinary sight seeing. Entrance fee is 5000won, so we just walk to some path, take picture and off we go"
Poor imitation,"Basically, this is a side trip for those gullible enough to make the long journey to Nami Island and want something else to do to justify the long journey out here. This place is about as French as my English uncle."
Nice lil attraction,"Nice attraction and can really see the effort they put in to make this place interesting. They even decorate every house with something to perk it up.But that being said, it's not a must see kind of place.Its conveniently located on the way to Nami Island. So do drop by if you feel like it.They also put up puppet shows and other shows as well."
Nice lil attraction,"Went with a group tour. Saved the hassle of waiting for buses/trains. But costs more though.Overall a nice attraction. But not a must see. But it's on the way to Nami Island, so it's convenient to add into your schedule if you're heading to Nami.Can see that they put in a lot of effort to even decorate each house and make it more interesting. There are puppet shows and other shows as well."
Not really worth it,Went there as part of a day trip package. Not really a fan of Pinocchio and puppetry and hence I wasn't really impressed with the place. It's quite small and I just don't see how I can recommend this as a must visit to anyone planning for a day trip outside Seoul central.
Picture perfect/korean drama location,"If you are a korean drama fanatic, this place must be really familiar with you. A lot of K dramas were shot here. This place is really pretty and perfect for pictorial. There are a lot of museums inside and also, there's a hotel accommodation too if you want to stay longer or overnight. There's one photo which showed a picture of it during winter and it looked so beautiful I wish I could see it during that season. We went there in between summer and fall so its quite warm and cold at the same time. There's also an amazing puppet show duo that you have to watch out for. We went there around 11am. Maybe there are other time slots for their show too. Over-all it was an amazing experience! I need to go back to korea and see again this place. Definitely worth it! "
NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY!!,"This place is not worth your money. Takes 8000won for such a small place that you can finish in 1-2 hours. I think most people comes here after they come from nami island as the usual itinerary. And the transportation ride to this place with the gapyeong city tour bus (+5000 won) is the worst bus ride at all. They pack you like sardines in a very winding road which makes this city tour bus not touristic at all. If u really wanted to come to this place, come by private tour bus with sure seats or by private car. Ride your own car or pack"
Petite France,Little Prince Little FranceGood shoes and umbrella neededFood stalls around the area Swarming with tourist A bit expensive-- 8000won. Didnt enjoy much! 
Not worth it,It is not only a restaurant. It was look like abandon village with empty and spooky houses. The garden is not well maintenance and there were renovation in several houses. Even for photos it was not that good. There were several movie posters but I do not recognize them. If you a Korean drama fan maybe you'll be interested. It is definitely not my favorite. I feel like I waste my time there. I only spent less than 1 hour and then left.
Worth visit if you are K-drama fans,"If you are K-drama fans, you should see this place in many of those dramas. We came here under the rain....the place is kind of hilly and slippery. It needs extra carefully walking around the ground. So make sure wearing a decent walking shoes. There is nothing much to do in this location other than starring those colorful buildings."
A theme park for lovers and family,It is a theme park I think more suitable for those like fairy tales. All those buildings are painted beautiful. A good place to take photos for lovers and family. Half day visit is enough because no good restaurant can be found here.
Colourful building,"It's a made or duplicate town with such a colorful building and beautiful scenery, because it's located on top of a mountain. Though not much you can do in here but it's always good to explore new place, and most of people go here because it usually use for korean drama filming."
day outing for tourists,"This spot looks like purpose built to resemble French Countryside and French village homes. Nothing much to see or do, but have a look around the many buildings and their decorations and the gardens. The cafes' and the sit down areas are an additional interest. Spectacular view of the surroundings from the top"
Nothing much but for photos,"We had Nami Island and Petite France on the same day so we didn't really spend lots of time here. It took about 20 minutes or so from Nami Island via shuttle bus to petite France. Some parts of the places were snowing along the way to place. I am not sure about other parts of Seoul but it was only snowing a lot in Seoul on our 5th day in Seoul(3rd Dec 2015). There was a man playing accordion while a visitor just having fun dance with the song.There was one of the houses which demo some of the musical instruments but she was using Korean in her presentation.There were only a few of visitors were there at that time.There are posters /banners of Korean Actors/Actress(Kim Soo hyun and Jun Ji-hyun) where visitors seemed to enjoy taking photos there. There was also a small Tower Eiffel, and collections of dolls which can be found in the houses there as well as paintings."
Picture worthy but not tour worthy,"It is crowded, some places are dirty. But a Gapyeong tour wouldn't be complete without going to this place. Or probably because the weather was gloomy when I went here. Do check it out during different seasons but not in a monsoon weather."
Little Prince,"Very picturesque theme park to visit. There are many photo taking opportunities. Buildings are cheerful with pretty bright colours. Interior of various buildings are adorned with beautiful decors. This attraction has been featured in various TV shows e.g. Running Man, You who came from the Stars. Good to visit this place in comfortable walking shoes. Takes 3-4hours. It's also nearby Nami Island. WiFi is available here."
Pretty houses and easy to walk around,"It is easy to walk around here. Around 1.5 hours and you are done with exploring the whole place. The main attractions are the houses near the entrance, where the amphitheater is, and the fountain square. Admission fee is charged at 8,000 won (SGD$9.50).To get to Petite France, take ITX train from Cheongnyangni station to Cheongpyeong station or Gapyeong station. If you are not going to Nami Island, I'd recommend you to stop at Cheongpyeong station as it is nearer to Petite France, Garden of Morning Calm, and shorter travelling journey from Seoul. 40 mins, 4,000 won (SGD$4.70). You can also take train and railway from Cheongnyangni station to Cheongpyeong or Gapyeong station but it takes 1.5 - 2 hours at 2,250 won (SGD$2.70).Depending on which station you alight (Cheongpyeong station Exit 2 or Gapyeong station), go to the bus stop outside of the station to take Gapyeong City Tour Bus to Nami Island, Petite France, or Garden of Morning Calm. Buy the Gapyeong City Tour Bus ticket from the driver at 5,000 won (SGD$6) per person. Keep ticket well as it can be used for unlimited number of bus trips on the same day. Remember the bus stop that you alight as it is the same bus stop to hop on to continue the same route."
Really petite ,"As the name implies, you can expect that this is a small place. Is not really worth it to drive all the way from Seoul just to visit IMO. But if this is along the way to somewhere else, it is worth stopping by for an hour or so. This place is famous for the Korean hit drama My man from the star. The running man series did one episode here as well. Entrance is not free. I think is about 10,000 won per person. For this price, I think it is reasonable. "
Pretty but nothing much,"The place is pretty much for photo shoot, unless you have some activities to do like running man games, then this place is perfect for hiding yourself all around. Other than that, it is really meant for ladies who love to take OOTD. Anywhere is nice, and sadly the time that we visited most things are closed, so we were unable to check the souvenirs out. There is an entrance fee, i can't remember how much exactly but it wasn't cheap. You can easily check that through Google. They had a stage for puppet show, people enjoyed it, but I don't feel attracted. Thus when my friend was watching i walked abit and took some selfies hehe. This place was used alot by the Running Man thus you could also see some photos of them there! (There's even DOTS' Song Joong Ki from the past as a RM member) Do take note of the last shuttle as many usually make this place as the last point of visit at Gyeonggi-do. We were super lucky that about 20mins late after the shuttle timing, we caught the last shuttle as the bus was late! *throws confetti*"
Part of it needs refurbishment ,"This place was shot in a number of Korean TV dramas including 'My love from the star'. Admission was 8,000 won. The area was small. Only one wall painting was still good (probably due to the direction of the wall it was on therefore it was less affected by sun light) and colors of most other wall paintings of The Little Prince had faded. The things sold in the souvenir shop also lack connection with the place. We left the place within an hour. It was ok to drop-by because we were going to other places on the route of the tourist shuttle bus from gapyeong station."
