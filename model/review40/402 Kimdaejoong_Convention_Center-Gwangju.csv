spacious and welcoming!,"location:>>> Just 1 min from Kimdaejung Stationreally big and spacious place fit for a big amount of people holds many conventions a month like the upcoming 2019 ACE Festival on the 26th and Green Car Korea on June 20th.to boost the tourism resources they have an International convention hall for international meetings cultural exchanges.the premises have 2 halls, a conference room, outdoor stage, musical fountain and a loading dock. they also have roughly 1,500 parking spaces on the basement and ground levels so you can always find space!"
Exhibition exhibition center,Huge 3 level exhibition center. Just infront of holiday inn hotel. Good location. However nothing much to do beside the exhibition.Near subway and some local coffee shop
Mixes convention convenience with city history,"The center is really big but very easy to get around. It is also accessible by bus and subway. Nearby coffee shops and hotels are many. Korean food and western food is available nearby. If your convention doesnâ€™t have any eats or drinks available, there are places inside the building for you to get snacks and drinks. "
Impressive facility,Great facility with a metro station right next door. Holiday Inn is opposite. Area is not happening but is not entirely remote. 
A great place for a large event,"We were part of a delegation attending a regional scout conference at the venue. Location was good, half hour walk from our hotel or a short bus ride on the conference shuttle. Venue had the capabilities to host many events at the same time, since there was also a tea convention and baby products convention at the same time.Dining room was very big, many breakout/seminar rooms, handicapped friendly restrooms, lifts, escalators, even live musicians performing in the lobby on certain days of the week.There are places to eat near the convention center"
"Large, modern convention centre","I had a lecture and an exhibit at this venue. Communication was clear and setup was painless. The venue is large and modern, but a bit outside of the areas of the city where you would want to stay overnight."
Convention glimpse into Korea,"Easy to get around the venue. Easy access to good hotels and the subway. On site restaurants and cafes, but also many to choose from nearby."
