JSA,This is the UN administered part of the DMZ. Access to the area is by a guided tour only. A dress code holds and a copy of your passport is required before hand. The tour is guided by a member of the military. This is the area where North & South Korea meet to discuss border issues.
Great experience ,Came here on a tour and was very lucky to spend a few hours at the Joint Security Area. So much history and a very informative guide to take us around. Glad to have experienced it. Explains a lot about the place.
More of a Political Site,"On 2019 June 28, Trump said he wants to be here to meet Kim. This place all of sudden became world famous including DMZ . Since President Moon shake hand here with Chairman Kim Sept 2018, this location resumed as a daily tourist event. As a matter of fact, this could be more of a Political Site than tourist spot. With the tension between North and South reduced, and hopefully a Peace treaty be signed, this place could became history. We enjoyed more to visit Imjingak and Dorasan and hopefully in future , from there, we can visit Gaeseong Industrial Complex or even further up North to some nice tourist spot of North Korea."
Incredible ,This place is also called the JSA (joint security area) and it where south meets North Korea. It is guarded by American military. You have your passport checked a few times and then get off your own bus and go watch and hear briefing on the JSA. You signs waiver saying you don’t have any weapons and do not plan to defect. You then get on the army buses and go into the JSA. You can see the giant flags as you go. The main area has 2 big buildings facing each other with blue buildings in the middle. The 2 big buildings sit in north and South Korea. Running through the blue buildings is a concrete line which marks the border. We could go into one of the blue buildings which meant at one point inside we were in North Korea! You cannot step across from the outside. We went to see the blue bridge.Our ‘tour guide’ was a great US army solider - such a cool and great guy. In fact they all were really approachable and you could ask them anything. We both felt that the JSA was a real highlight of our whole trip - well worth going on a tour here.You do have to wear certain clothing which if you go on a guide they’ll let you know.
No JSA tours,"Totally disappointed. I felt completely misled on this one. The only reason I wasted a day was to see the compound. This wasn’t reviled until the very end of the tour (currently closed to the general population). The places you are bus you to are just simple tourist spots. Only one highlight was the overlook. They gave 20 minutes there and your bus is ready to leave. The 3 tunnel stop, a huge climb and tricky walk to see a rusted door. Was it worth it? Probably but still very disappointed. "
INCREDIBLE,"Here you find yourself just in the heart of the two sides of Korea, you can feel what the division is like. Unique experience."
Lack of Consistency,"I took the Cosmojin DMZ (Demilitarized Zone) tour with a North Korean defector. This was to say, originally booked for a tour of the JSA (Joint Security Area).Although the tour went well, I found unethical practices from the company that offers a tour to the JSA when it has been unavailable since October 2018 due to security changes. The tour guide was informative, the opportunity to talk to a North Korean defector was admirable, but the business practice by the company just left lingering animosity since what they are doing is dishonest, by allowing you to book something they are unable to guarantee at all, with reasonable doubt that we would be unable to go to JSA during the time of the booking.I do not recommend Cosmojin."
An absolute must do!!,"I’ve already written a review under Camp Boniface so thought I’d highlight a few things I would have found useful before I went;1. You will only see Panmunjom if you book a joint JSA/DMZ tour. Some people on our coach seemed to think it was part of the half day DMZ tour but it isn’t. The morning is the DMZ tour then the afternoon is the visit to the JSA. I would hate to be sat on a bus going back to Seoul at 1pm knowing I was missing out of the best bit. Some tour companies don’t make it clear so do your research.2. The dress code is strict and a soldier will check you. Tour guides have extra clothing with them but i wouldn’t count on it especially if you are larger than the average Korean!! That being said, men were able to wear shorts below the knee, small logos on polo shirts were fine, shorts sleeves were allowed as was round neck tshirts as it was incredible hot. I have attached a picture of the JSA dress code rules given by my tour company as it did stress me out quite a bit beforehand. 3. The waiver you sign before the briefing at Camp Boniface is given back to you on the way out so no need to worry about the legality of signing it. 4. The JSA tour can be cancelled at the very last moment for a whole host of reasons from the obvious security ones to dignitary visits. There’s no refund if this happens but you will be offered a transfer to another date as happened to me. There are specific days/dates that tours don’t run but the tour operators have this on their websites.5. It’s unlikely that you’ll see any North Korean guards facing off against the South Korean soldiers across the DMZ line. They hate the JSA tours and complain constantly about them so refuse to “participate” according to the US soldier who briefed our coach. The only time you might see them is if there is a tour on their side in which case they’ll appear. Notwithstanding all of the above, it is the most amazing experience so make sure you do it!!!"
Great trip but don't get caught off guard,"You're only able to visit this area with specific tour groups in Seoul and it's a unique experience being at a place that is both well known and dangerous at the same time.There were no North Korean guards when we visited and we have to follow many rules like specific clothing and no random photo taking, but the trip itself was well worth it.Will strongly recommend visiting this place if you're into history and politics, but be aware that trips here can be cancelled at any time due to various reasons, so be sure to go with a legit tour company. Be sure to go with a tour company where you can pay only on the day of the tour, so you don't have to go through the hassle of a refund if anything happens.We went with Cosmojin and the tour company allowed us to pay via cash on the day of the tour itself. "
"Eerie, riveting, and unforgettable","If you've done your research, then hopefully you've found one of the few tour groups that will actually take you all the way to the buildings of Panmunjom, while the other tours have concluded miles away. And by the time your bus has reached the exterior of Camp Bonifas, you've already been tantalized by a distant North Korean landscape looming on the horizon as viewed from the Dora Observatory. You've probably come from the Third Tunnel, where you saw absolutely nothing of North Korea.After a brief wait, anxious with anticipation, you are finally driven slowly past a sizeable fence into the Demilitarized Zone as you enter the military encampment. After a brief presentation on what not to do, this is the moment you've been waiting for! Tourists are driven out of camp down a narrow road, past, watch towers, barb-wire fences, and minefields. This is the last of South Korea, where a handful of farmers remain, owning land only through inheritance. Otherwise, this is a place strictly off limits to most of the world.Within minutes, you are dropped off in front of a large, unadorned gray complex through which you are escorted. It's a facility fit for presidents and diplomats, yet purely functional and completely undecorated. As you walk through the building in two single-file lines and ride up an escalator, you're suddenly there. Without fanfare, you've exit the upper floor of the structure where those tiny blue huts you've seen photographed and filmed hundreds of times stand right before your very eyes. But your gaze cannot be broken from the North Korean building directly in front of you and the very doors from which Kim Jong-Un occasionally emerges to attend meetings.After brief explanation inside the main blue hut, you step past a table marking the border between the two countries and you're now standing in North Korea. The experience is brief, a whirlwind event to be sure. But the memory of standing in the most mysterious country in the world will stay with you forever."
The tour might have been good if Cosmojin hadn't cancelled my reservation and then refused to refund my money.,"This review is not of the tour, but of the travel agency. I booked the tour three months in advance. Shortly before my trip I found out that a friend would be in Korea at the same time so I called Cosmojin to ask about the possibility of adding another person to our tour. The woman who answered said that the tour was fully booked. I asked about the possibilty of cancelling the tour, but she said that a refund was not possible. She asked if I wanted to cancel, and I specifically said no, since my money would not be refunded. Two days before the tour I called Cosmojin to get clarification on the pickup area for the tour. Imagine my surprise when I was told that my reservation had been cancelled. Cosmojin said that they would not refund my money, even though I had not authorized the cancellation. They said that they could substitute another DMZ tour, but I was not interested because it did not have the same features as the JSA tour. I was willing to substitute other tours that Cosmojin offered but they would only offer the DMZ tour and nothing else. Cosmojin never budged on their 'no refund' policy. I had to ask Veltra (online booker) to intercede on my behalf and even Veltra was not able to negotiate with Cosmojin. My advice...go with another tour/travel agency and stay away from Cosmojin. Their customer service policy is a joke."
Unique experience,Unique experience. We visited the DMZ and JSA. There are only 5 tour companies which go there.We weren’t able to exit the bus at the border but had to be content with taking pictures from the bus. We did not see any North Korean soldiers. We heard that potential talks between North and South Korea May limit visits here should they coincide with talks.
"Quite a bizarre tour, but super interesting too!","Visiting the Demilitarized Zone (aka DMZ) between North and South Korea was quite a bizarre experience. Yet it was one of those bizarre experiences that I would certainly recommend to anyone traveling to Seoul and at all interested in local affairs. At the time of our trip, we couldn't, unfortunately, visit the JSA too, but the Unification Observatory, the DMZ, the 3rd Infiltration Tunnel, the Imjigank Village and the Dora Observatory were excellent to visit in order to understand more details about the conflict between these 2 countries. I found our guide to be knowledgeable and open to questions. The trip was well organized, not too rushed, and included a wholesome lunch that was easily made vegetarian to our request. I would definitely recommend this trip to anyone traveling to Seoul, as it offers such a contrast between the city life and the border areas, and it's crucial to understand what the countries are all about."
Highly recommended,"One of the highlights of our trip was going to JSA of Panmunjom, the border between North and South Korea and the very place where peace negotiation takes place. There are very strict rules in going in here, from the clothes one wears, to the identification cards being sent for review, to the forming of lines and no sudden movements in going in the freedom houses, etc. but it is all worth it. Must see in Korea!"
"A quite different tourist experience, highly recommended","We booked our combined DMZ-JSA tour with Viator, no problems, well organised, on time, with a well spoken English language guide. The JSA tour part was after lunch (unfortunately the lunch was awful, everything else was fine). The JSA tour started at Camp Bonifas (security briefing plus introductory video) then went to the JSA and the MAC room (our tour was unable to get to Freedom House or the Bridge of No Return). Very strictly controlled, a strong military presence, as would be expected. A highly recommended tour. Check the clothing requirements."
A Must See,"Visiting Panmunjom (판문점) was one of the main highlights of my trip to Seoul. I highly recommend it to anyone who comes as it is a great way to learn the history of the Korean peninsula and better understand what the situation is like at the Korean demilitarized zone (한반도 비무장 지대). I did the JSA Only Tour with Seoulistic which included stops at the Korea War Memorial and Imjingak Park with a traditional Korean lunch provided. I liked how although you were putting yourself in a potentially very dangerous situation, the guards made you feel safe and relaxed by sharing personal stories and asking visitors questions. I also really liked my tour guide, Sky. She was so sweet and had a lot of information to share. [And for all of those Descendants of the Sun fans out there, the place is swarming with ROK soldiers so you can fantasize all day long]."
Make sure to do the JSA tour,"I did the combined DMZ and JSA tour. The DMZ part was done in the morning and the JSA in the afternoon. I was a bit disappointed with the DMZ part. The activities were not very interesting and you are just missing the real thing which is seeing the military-guarded border with North Korea; the Joint Security Area (JSA).As fas as I have understood, the DMZ tour is a daily tour whereas the JSA is not. So I was pretty pretty lucky to make both in the same day. The atmosphere is a weird mix of strictness, excitment and fun. It is somnice to have a look at the border and the display of the buildings and soldiera. JSA is an unique experience and is a must if you are some interest in history and politics, or if you just want to boast to have been there ;)"
Badly organised,"I took a DMZ tour organised by Adventure Korea in 2017 and it was awful. The tour guide spoke very little English and the bus hardly got there on time. I wasted a lot of time on this tour. However, the place itself was unique and interesting."
Exiting place,"For completely understanding the impact of the war and the meaning of this place, I recommend you to go to the Korean War Museum in Seoul first. It is really interesting info.At this place you will stand in front of the border with North Korea. This is the closest you can get to the border and to the North Korean soldiers from South Korea. This place has a lot of history (attacks, people escaping, etc), be sure to check the museum at this site also for reading all about it.A once in a lifetime experience!"
An absolute must when visiting Korea,"The JSA-only tour was worth every penny. The tour guide (Seo-lee?) was so amazing and provided very helpful background information on the ride up towards the DMZ. What was more incredible was the Q and A session that was on the bus with the North Korean defector. Should you choose to do this tour, make sure to think of questions in advance, as there was priceless information that was garnered from these questions.We were lucky enough to not only see North Korean soldiers at the border, but to also see a group of North Korean students who were supposedly on a field trip watching us watch them. It was a surreal experience, and one I cannot recommend highly enough."
"Meeting Area For Doraman Station and Observatory, Old Train","We came here with our guide to catch the bus. He smartly drove us here earlier to buy the front seats. That was good because we could see where we were going. At this area, there is the old train that got shot up at the start of the war. Also the old train tracks. Also a memorial. All of these just reminders of the war and the separation between North and South. Not the most interesting part of any of the tours."
JSA/DMZ combined tour with PTC,"Well worth the visit and incredible to see how it looks from the outside so 5 stars for what you visualise... but terrible in terms of guide and history what we were told I could of read on the Internet in 10 minutes. It's so short a each place and it's not sweet, you get off the bus take photos and back on the bus there's no talk about history or a reason to why it is how it is!! One guide between 40 people is very hard to ask questions and learn why. When you do ask a question I got the such a plain answer. One tip at JSA would be to speak to one of the US personal they will tell a few things that are interesting and answer your questions about the area "
A must do if visiting Korea,Heart of the DMZ in South Korea and a must visit if you want to fell the sadness of people divided by maniacs and Politics. Hope and pray one of these days in the not too distant future common sense will prevail in this crazy stand off. 
Amazing view of war and history,It is a sight to see. There is literally a line across the entire compound that divides North from South. Guards stand face to face with stern looks at each other with only a painted line holding them back. There are explosives on the bridges as you travel up from Seoul. Everything is set to slow down an invasion from North Korea. It is the closest thing to an active war zone most people will ever see in their life.
Awesome,Really enjoyed this spot and was fortunate to get into the other side of North Korea as there were no meetings or dignitaries on site. Very moving experience to see North Koreans on watch as the same as the South Koreans watching them. 
A tour of a lifetime!,This is definitely a special tour. I booked my daughter and I the JSA tour. The tour itself was short but very informative. One will have an appreciation what the South Korean military need to do to watch over their perimeter. We came the day after the US VP came so we were really lucky the tour went through as scheduled as it sometimes gets cancelled and there is no money back when this happens. The tour needs to be booked ahead of time as space is very limited. US soldiers are the ones that gave the orientation. Very impressive and kindda funny because they have their own two cents put in it. They were saying that it's ok to fall asleep while doing the slide orientation but it was really interesting so you are constantly at the edge of your seat wanting to know more about the place. I can't say enough good things about the JSA area military personnel. Kudos and what an amazing bunch of people! 
GREAT!!,As part of our DMZ/JSA tour. There was so much information about the Korean war and why it happened. The guides are wonderful and full of information. It's weird being so close to the most dangerous and most reclusive country in the world.
Lacking of information,"I had difficulties apprehending the tour guide's command of English as she spoke with a very strong korean accent. The information she gave was very scripted that I might as well google on the internet myself.The tour to 'bridge of no return' had been permanently cancelled due to security reasons since Jan 2017, but this was not communicated to us beforehand.I had joined the tour and wished I could get some insights of the relationship between South and North korea from a South Korean's perspective, but it was a disappointment, there wasn't. I wouldn't recommend engaging Tour DMZ, based in Hotel President.The only interesting part of the tour is that you get to be on the border, and throughout the journey, being escorted by a UN US army personnel."
DMA/JSA Tour,"I highly recommend the Koridoor Tours of the DMZ/JSA. The price is a little steep. Around $90 per person. The tour starts from the USO building at 7:00am. Takes about 1 hr to arrive at Camp Bonifas. From there you watch a small presentation then head to the Joint Services Area. This is the highlight of the tour where you get to see North Korean and South Korean soldiers facing each other and tour the inside of the building where talks are held between the North and South officials. From there, you head to Dora observatory where you can view North Korea and listen to the propoganda on loudspeakers from both sides. Tour goes on to Dorasan station, the last station before crossing the border. Here we had a nice lunch of bibimbap or kalbi. After lunch it was on to the Third Tunnel. It' a long long way down. About 500 meters or more. The difficult part is coming back up. If you go down, make sure you are in good physical shape to come back up. The tunnel itself is wet and has a low hanging ceiling. If you are tall, the hardhats will be your best friend. That is basically the tour. You get back to the USO building around 3:30. I highly recommend the USO tour. I've done a regular Korean tour and missed the JSA part,."
A must-see attraction when in Korea!,"Korea is divided into a democratic South Korea and communist North Korea. The war between the North and South devastated many families and numerous lives were lost. While the two countries are still technically at war, they have signed an Armistice agreement to put a ""pause"" on the war.The DMZ is a highly militarised strip that serves as a buffer zone between the two Koreas. It is an area of high tension and can be toured only through private tour groups with strict military supervision. The tour offers an opportunity to visit the JSA, the United Nations Commision Military Armistice Conference (UNCMAC) Building, freedom house, the observation point to look over into North Korea, Dorasan station, the 3rd infiltration tunnel and if there are no recent hostile actions from the North, the bridge of no return. Unfortunately, the bridge of no return was scrapped from our tour, owing to recent ballistic missile tests from the North.The UNCMAC Building in the JSA is the iconic little blue house, where meetings are held between the two Koreas. It allows you an opportunity to step over into North Korea. The room is incredibly small and your time in there is VERY limited! Dorasan Station is a train station that used to do across-the-border trips. The tracks run from Seoul to Pyeongyang. The platform is named the unification platform as it aims to one day, serve as an area of unification of people from North and South Korea.While the tour was strictly regulated, it was with definitely good reason. This is an area if high tension that could erupt into a warzone at any point in time... The trip to the DMZ is a must-see when in Korea, but we should never forget that it is a reminder of arguably the most painful time in Korean history..."
Dull day at Panmunjeom (fortunately)...,"as there were no nasty surprises of the hot metal at high speed variety. Our tour, once we got to Camp Bonifas and then the DMZ itself, became rather strict and regimented, doubtless for very good reasons. After lining up at Freedom House, we were led down to the iconic low-rise blue buildings, one being the famous conference room. ROK guards in sunglasses and with a Taekwondo attack posture seemed rather more fearsome than the lone DPRK sentry way up on the balcony of the North's own guest house. Our young U.S. Army guide was quite informative, but obviously had to adhere to his script. It all lasted barely 15 minutes before we were ushered back on to the bus and the JSA gift shop. Thank you Kim Jong Un and Presidents Park and Obama for not spoiling our afternoon. What will it be like after 20th January, I wonder."
Sensational,The place where you can watch North Korean soldiers and their soils. It was very unique experience for me.
A must-see in South Korea,"Coupling a tour to the DMZ and the JSA at Panmunjom was the most exciting part of our trip to Korea. The JSA is as close as you can get to North Korea. It's an eery feeling to peer at a North Korean guard across the way. Be careful not to bring a telephoto lens over 90mm or 100mm, cause they forbid using them, I suppose not to rattle the North Koreans into believing it is arms. The room where the two sides squared off is amazingly small. You can have a photo op with a guard but no ""monkey business,"" I saw a female tourist try to touch the guard's uniform and she was shoved aside."
Sense of excitement trip,Took a day trip coupled with the DMZ tour. The fact that we crossed the DMZ line into North Korea made it all exciting for me and my son and nephew. 
Historic,"The Admission Fee: None.The Site: Definitely a tourist attraction spot. Historic site about Korean history/Korean War. A few monuments to remember the soldiers and the war. Very informative about the history. This site is very close to DMZ. If you are touring DMZ, definitely swing by this site as well. The Parking: Big parking lot, 2,000 won parking fee."
Contrived tourist trap,"So this place is supposed to be ""tense"" and stuff, but honestly, to me the whole thing felt contrived and staged. We first went for a briefing at Camp Bonifas, where they build up this whole idea that there's tension about, and that ""you will be watched"" while at the JSA etc. They give you a brief history of the region. I didn't learn much that was new information. The JSA itself is a series of buildings - some of which belong to the South and some of which belong to the North. The building you are allowed to enter is the room where discussions take place between the North/South and UN representatives. There are South Korean soldiers there. They take it all very seriously, despite the closest North Korean soldier - and in fact the only visible North Korean - being roughly 300m away. You're marched in, in two single file lines, like children, from the main building to the blue UN building. You can then take photos and selfies with statue-like South Korean soldiers. They tell stories about people being ""grabbed"" from doorways, and dragged to the North Korean side of the line (as if). It's really all a bit odd.Then it's to the gift shop (obviously). It was reasonably priced in comparison to the airport, especially for the Soju alcohol. I paid $30 in comparison for the $45 they were asking at duty free in the airport! Good deal. Then it was off for a poor lunch, and a long walk down/up the Third Infiltration Tunnel. This was the best part of the tour, but it's a tough walk back up to ground level. I think this is something worth doing while in Korea, but I don't think its a unique/authentic experience. I found it all a bit lame, in all honesty."
A must see for anyone in the country,I visited here as part of a tour group. The total cost for a whole day and 3 locations plus lunch was $55. I would have paid twice that based on the experience. The tour guide was excellent and the videos and stories brought everything to life. This is one of those places where you only read about in history books and then one day you are living the history. Take the time and make the visit. 
Unique tourist destination,"This must be a one of its kind tourist destination if you can call it that. It is the place where the armstice agreement was signed in 1953. It is a 800 square metre area, officially called the Joint Security Area (JSA). Neither North nor South Korea have jurisdiction over this area. After 1976, security guards cannot walk over the other side's area. Gives a eerie feeling. "
JSA,"Visiting Camp Bonifas and the Joint Security Area (JSA) is very exciting, you can actually feel the tension when you enter the small blue baracks in which South and North Koreans meet each other. A must see thing when visiting Korea as it is a reminder of the past that still continues."
Melancholically Amazing,"I came here on a full day tour with the tour agency Korridor, which included the 3rd Infiltration Tunnel, observatory, Dorasan Station and the JSA.This is one of the attractions that I would consider a 'must visit' in South Korea. It really changes your world view and the idea of peace which we take for granted.The tour here was lead by a US soldier who gave us an in-depth description of the JSA. He was very approachable and would take questions very politely. It's actually pretty amazing how it is a merely a ""line"" that separates two nations of similar roots and language; pretty sad when you think about how it came to this.You would get a chance to ""step in"" to the North Korean side when you are in the Conference Row houses. Although, be mindful to listen to thw soldiers instructions of when to take and when not to take photographs. I managed to see only one North Korean soldier on guard when I was there, and he was quite a distance away."
SO COOL!,"My boyfriend has been dying to go on a JSA tour and I booked it well in advance to make sure it doesn't get sold out. I myself was surprised at how much I enjoyed as I didn't expect to like it as much as I did. If you are taking a trip to the DMZ JSA is a must. Many people did not seem to know that JSA is separate tour not necessarily included in the DMZ tour so when booking make sure it says JSA. The whole experience is a little surreal as you realize how isolated one country can still be. You are given strict instructions before visiting the JSA, including a dress code that does not allow for open toe shoes, shorts and shirts with no collar. There are several checkpoints and your passport is checked at each one. Once in JSA area you are given only 4 minutes in North Korea( little blue house). You are allowed to take photos and it create a very intriguing atmosphere. Once you return back to the main meeting point you are allowed to take photos with the south korean and american soldiers who are all really nice and friendly. In addition to the JSA our tour included the observatory as well as the 3rd infiltration tunnel . When at the observatory you can see in to north korea throug the binoculars and hear the North Korean propaganda playing . The third tunnel is a bit of a hike so be prepared and if you are claustrophobic this may not be the thing for you."
Panmunjom,"Must see for anyone wanting to know history or to have a sense of current events. I combined my tour to the DMZ with this because it was a full day tour, lunch in between. I suggest seeing both on the same day."
Well organised,I went with the company TOURDMZ to the JSA only our. The tour was well organised with good guide. Don't go with great expectations since ther is not so much to see but nevertheless it is worthwhile (once!). A good Korean-style lunch was included.
Very Icky feeling,A very strange place like crossing over to another world. There is a museum here to see the history of the border and of course the sight of the famous Bridge Of No Return. i never went to the Northern side but then again when I was there in 1998 I was in the military.
To see it is to appreciate it!,"A fascinating if grim experience, we booked the tour with the American Base in Seoul. Passing miles and miles of razor wire, troops and tank barriers, it was the opportunity to experience firsthand seeing South and North Korean (ROCK) soldiers staring each other down and hearing the stories from inside the “blue building” that really brought home the tensions between these two countries. We had to book two weeks out. If you arrive early, you may have a chance to scoot inside the base for a breakfast sandwich and coffee!"
History maniac's favourite spot ,I was really lucky to have been to the Panmunjom area from both north and south on tours. To think how the events unfolded that led to the nation divided makes this place more historical. 
Panmunjom Travel Center - excellent company,"I did the combined Panmunjom DMZ and JSA tour. We also saw the third tunnel; Imjingak peace bell and bridge of freedom; Dora observatory; dorasan train station and the JSA.We also had a North Korean defector with us and she was really interesting and answered lots of question.This company was excellent, organized, efficient and professional. Lunch was also included which was really delicious.Couldn't recommend more highly."
Can't miss JSA/DMZ tour,"BOOKING:I booked with AllSeoulTours JSA/DMZ tour on a Thursday for the 87,000 KRN. If you book with other agencies you may pay over 125,000 KRN, which is crazy because most are run by Cosmojin and most end up using the same bus for the tour. TOUR:When we arrived to Camp Bonifas we were all briefed on a bit of history, please make sure you follow all instructions given. Either US military or Korean military may get on you if you fail to follow instructions. They will let you know what you can take pictures of and of what angles when you get to the Freedom House. The tour itself is not to be missed, especially being so close to the border and actually seeing a North Korean soldier."
Must See for Yourself!,"We took the DMZ/JSA tour with Discover Seoul and were very pleased. You have to request this specific tour at least two weeks out or you won't get it. The views and the stories were amazing. If you benefited from this review, please click the ""helpful"" button."
Good experiences for myself and kids,"My kids were born in Canada and this was good tour for them. However, lunch provided during the tour was so terrible. I am Korean/Canadian and I was so embarrassed to other foreigners. You can't call that was lunch. And understanding both Korean and English...... Translation was somewhat 70% correct during the tour. Anyway, overall experience was good..... OH!!!! Bring many water bottles or soda for yourself. Don't even try to buy it from the restaurants. What a rip off....."
A Can't Miss Visit,"I did the joint DMZ-JSA tour. The highlight for me of the DMZ portion was the Third Infiltration Tunnel and the museum on the grounds. I would recommend that portion especially. However, the JSA is everything I expected and more. When the US soldier boarded the bus and gave us strict orders to follow his commands without exception, I knew this was no ordinary tourist visit. I had plotted the famous ""blue buildings"" on Google Earth, and then, all of a sudden there they were, and there was North Korea only yards away from where we stood. Walking across the one lane road and entering the middle blue building had all the tension I had expected. Moments later I was standing in North Korea. How amazing. As others have stated- do both portions of the trip; just going to the DMZ Is OK, but the walking into North Korea is beyond words."
A comprehensive tour with Cosmojin,"A long day visiting Panmunjom, JSA, DMZ, Third Tunnel, Dora Observation Post and Dorasan station with lunch at Imjingang in the middle.Booked a week in advance with Cosmojin. They were very quick to get back with all the details. Some last minute challenges caused by the International Rotary Conference made it a bit hectic. They normally pick you up at your hotel and drop you off at Itaewon early evening (Take advantage of this to explore the area and its extensive eateries). The guide was excellent making sure everyone was taken care of. and all transfers went smoothly. The army guides were also great and with their extensive knowledge able to answer even the most obscure questions.All in all a great tour and recommended for anyone interested in the Korean War and its aftermath."
One of the most interesting places on earth!,"Going inside the Joint Security Area (JSA) is the last active relic of the Cold War and is a must for anyone interested in this topic.You literally see South and North Korea soldiers staring at each other. You enter the actual building where the negotiations take place and can stand (safely) in the North Korea territory within the building.If you can find a tour just of the JSA take it. The other sights on the DMZ tour are not worth the time. Unless it specifically says JSA, you will not actually enter the DMZ.Please note the United Nations has a dress code to enter the JSA in recognition of its special status and dignity."
Extremely interesting visit to the Joint Security Area (JSA) / Panmunjom,Had a very interesting visit to JSA with Seoul City Tours. Made the booking through their website and got immediate response by email. After providing needed information I got payment details and the payment was also processed through their website. Everything worked as promised. Guide spoke good English. JSA experience is surprisingly intense since you really can feel the tension on the border. Booking has to be made at least 48 hours before the visit in order to allow needed passport processing time for the officials.
Rich in history,A nice place to learn about the history of N&S Korea. Beautiful view from the top of the mall. Have to go up.
Travel Adventure Korea,Excellent place on the way to the DMZ. Very worthwhile visit to see the big difference between freedom and oppression.
Interesting experience but a little dry,"Basically we went to do the Panmunjom.DMZ Combined Tour, which includes visiting of panmunjom, west front line dmz, 3rd tunnel, dorasan station, camp bonifas and ended with the jsa tour. The tour was ran smoothly and the tour guide was very detailed as well. It was a little dry given all the stories and the seriousness of the issue as the two koreas are still technically at war. There was some slight tension especially at the border. I enjoyed the entire tour but found it just slightly expensive. Big sized cameras are not recommended. Bring some walking shoes, and the tour starts from 7am ends around 4.30pm sharp. Highly recommended, probably the closest we can ever get to north korea."
Seoul trip highlight,"We booked the via USO Koridoor for full day JSA and DMZ tour as we could not vist JSA on our own. There is a train provided from Seoul Station to Dorasan Station (DMZ), but not to JSA.Places that we went were JSA, Dora Observatory, Dorasan Station and the Third Infiltration Tunnel. At the JSA, there is a souvenir shop that sells stuff from North Korea like North Korean currency and liquor.Awesome trip and hospitality from the tour guy (Hi Vincent!) and the UN armies."
JSA-A glimpse inside the conflict,"You get a glimpse inside the JSA area where the south and north Koreans meet to try to reconcile their differences. Kind of intense having rock soldiers on the S Korean side and N Korean soldiers looking back at us. Make sure you book your DMZ tour with JSA, great glimpse inside the conflict and hopefully a resolution."
Excellent Experience Except for Tour Guides,"We booked through All Seoul Tours. We were picked at our hotel on time but our driver had difficulty finding the place where the other couple was staying. We arrived late at the assembly point and luckily caught the tour as they were leaving for our buses. Our tour guide was beside herself because the hotel pick-up times were later than she thought they should be. Our guide's English speaking skills were marginal and it was difficult to understand what she was saying. She thought we were all on a JSA only tour, when in fact we were scheduled for both the JSA and DMZ tours. She was ill informed and gave us conflicting information about what we would be doing.The Joint Service Area tour is truly a ""do not miss"" experience. Being able to look across the border and see the North Korean guards brings the tense situation there into reality. Visiting the building where the meetings take place between the 2 Koreas is a real highlight.Lunch was not well coordinated, as we were shuffled from one guide to another. Our DMZ guide communicated effectively, but tended to lose focus with the information. She frequently lost her train of thought.The 3rd Tunnel tour was physically demanding, as our guide had forewarned. The grade down to the tunnel is 11 degrees, which is very steep. When you reach the tunnel itself, the ceiling is low, so if you are taller than 5 foot 5, you will have to bend over to keep from hitting your head for most of the trip through the tunnel to the wall built by the South Korean army.The Dora Observatory is interesting but it was hazy, so difficult to see into North Korea. On a clear day, it would be very special. The train station is also interesting but since the service stopped into North Korea, only 2 trains per day make it to the station from the south.Upon arrival back in Seoul, we were taken to an amethyst store where we waited over 45 minutes, after being told it would be 20 minutes. Many people left to take a taxi or subway back to their hotels. This was a unnecessary stop, in our opinion, but you have no choice.The quality of your experience will depend upon your tour guides. Ours were just OK, at best, which is unfortunate because the JSA and DMZ are well worth seeing."
Cosmojin JSA+DMZ tour,"Full day tour that picked up from our hotel and included lunch. Tour guide Han was great! (Very knowledgeable on area and history. He was very quick to offer helpful advice/tips on the area.) If you're going to the DMZ, be sure to pick the tour that includes the JSA and be sure to book in advance. (Passport/background check and JSA tour is popular.)"
JSA is a most interesting place mixing historic events w current politics,"The two sides, standing face-to-face and the West and the United Nations holding a stand with daily harsh routines, no one would believe it if you have not seen it. We made it into the blue barrack and had 4 minutes exactly to take fotos. This IS a place where I am glad I look South to North and not reverse. Thanks to the soldiers for friendly explanations"
Thrilling!,"Panmunjom has a block of buildings on either side of the border. There is a blue building which falls on either side of the border, inside which you will enter and see a conference table (right on the border, with chairs falling on either side). You can click pictures in this area but ONLY facing the North Korea side- no photos/ videos are allowed for the S Korean sides- so don’t even try a selfie with S Korean buildings in the background; one person tried and was sternly asked to delete the picture from pics and delete folders."
Informative tour but the guide's poor prononciation ruined it all...,"As non english native speakers - but fluent, having a tour guide whom speaks clearly is crucial to us... this wasn't the case at all and as the day went one her speech got worst and worst as if she was on auto mode. We noticed that even the native english tourists struggled to understand. By the end, we gave up trying to comprehend any of her words as she had given us a massive headache !!Overall the tour itself was fine, interesting and comprehensive but i guess you'll get to see the exact same thing with any other tour company (we went on the Panmunjom combined tour i.e DMZ + JSA)"
JSA tour Cosmojin,"Wow! Definitely a once in a life time experience! No matter how much research you do before you go, you'll never be close to understanding the JSA until you go. We learnt so much from our tour guide on the way and it only added to the atmosphere when we arrived. A must do!"
One of a kind experience,"The last remaining stronghold of the Korean War. A must see before it's gone in the future due to either reunification or war. You get to see the tensions between the two Koreas and you also get to purchase rare North Korean goods at the shop from the JSA. A very good tour in general. If you go to Seoul and do nothing else, you MUST do this."
Highlight of South Korea trip,"As an experience it's amazing, both as a current point of interest as well as a point of history. Having done the rest of the DMZ tour this is a complete highlight and I think it's important to do a tour that takes in the JSA as well as all the other elements. We booked ours through Koridoor, and aside from a rather irritating guide the tour was great. Within the JSA you get guided by an American serviceman, you get to see the entirety of the JSA, from the Bridge of No Return to the area where the negotiations happen as well as the defensive elements of the DMZ. You also get to stand in North Korea (within the hut where negotiations happen), which is pretty cool!"
An absolute must see,"As a Vietnam era Veteran, I was curious about the Korean Conflict from years earlier. You must book your tour at least 48 hours in advance. You MUST have your passport. You MUST...REPEAT MUST follow the instructions about the dress code and photography restrictions. Two people on our tour photographed areas that were clearly shown to us as restricted. The United States Army MP confiscated the camera, removed the chip and gave the camera back to the idiots that won't listen. This ain't the ""affluenza"" teen excuse. This is as serious as a heart attack! One person was wearing jeans and was denied exit of the bus at the JSA. The experience crossing, albeit 15 feet, over the North Korean border is a bit intense. The two countries are technically still at war. There is NO DOUBT as to the seriousness of the rules and the reasoning why. I thoroughly enjoyed the entire day and would like to do it again."
Must see,"The DMZ-JSA tour is a must. I booked my tour through Viator, which was fine. Lots of companies offer this tour and I think they're mostly the same. There's a half day DMZ only option, but I really recommend adding the JSA portion. A foreign (non-South Korean) passport is required. You may glimpse a North Korean soldier, and you'll technically step over the North Korea/South Korea boundary. Bonus of doing the full day tour - we were dropped off at the Lotte shopping center at the end of the day - didn't have to go through the ginseng hard sell that they tack on at the end of the half day tours. "
Feel the tension at the DMZ / JSA,"We booked a full day tour, pick up from Lotte Hotel in Seoul. Due to access restrictions bookings need to be made at least 48 hours in advance. Our tour guide was a very energetic lady with a high pace of doing things so no time to get bored. One of the unique selling points of this tour is the defector from North Korea joining the tour (or at least halfway), to explain about her life and answer questions. The first stop was the observatory that, unfortunately is under construction in 2016, nevertheless there's an explanatory video and you can use the free binoculars to have a look at a North Korean village at the other side of the DMZ that shows some village people working on the fields. Next stop is the old train station and amusement park, apparently build for the people that wanted to be close to their North Korean relatives, It has a surreal composition with barricaded bridges and barbwire on one hand and the joy of an amusement park on the other hand.After a straight forward lunch (options bulgogi or bibimbap) it was time to see the JSA. After the barricades to reach the first checkpoint, you can feel the tension. Passport checks, signing a waiver for your insurance, and some more barricades to reach the blue buildings. Even though it supposed to be very safe, with North Korea in the news of the past few weeks it adds some tension to the tour. We were allowed to take some quick photos before swimming by the monument of the two soldiers that died trying to help a defector, and the bridge of no return.It's a remarkable tour, one of its kind and a must see for people interested in this kind of history. One thing I'd like to keep in mind is that the tour is overly positive towards South Korea where I believe there are always two sides to the story."
Excellent educational tour,"Did it with PTC, felt it was good value with lunch thrown in. The history lesson of Korea begins as soon as the bus rolls out and there is a Q&A session with an NK defector. Tour includes Mt Odu observatory which offers great views of NK across the Han river. US Army takes over the tour at the border. This tour is a very good way to learn how the country was split and experience life at the border during a suspended war that is actually not finished yet."
DMZ/JSA Tour with Panmunjom Travel Center Tours (panmunjomtour.com),"We were going to be in Seoul for several days, and as my husband enjoys history, we decided we needed to see the DMZ. When booking this tour, they requested passport information and credit card numbers via email, though you could call (internationally) with your credit card number. I didn't feel comfortable with emailing my credit card, so they offered for me to provide/pay online with a service called EximBay. I had never heard of this and it made me more leery of using it for paying for our tour, but after finding no complaints on the internet about this service, I went ahead and did it with no problems. It is about an hour bus ride from Seoul, however, our tour operator was delayed in departing because we spent probably an hour driving around picking up other tourists and translators. I was told this was abnormal for the tour group. Our bus was pretty small, especially compared to the other buses that we saw at the tourists sites, but it was still comfortable. Our guide was informative and spoke clear English, though they had Chinese and Japanese translators available as well. The DMZ tour was in the morning, we had plenty of chances to stop at different sites with bathrooms and snacks/souvenirs available for purchase. The 3rd Infiltration tunnel was the morning DMZ tour highlight, though the walk back out of the tunnel was a bit strenuous even for someone young and in decent health. After lunch, which was included in our tour, we boarded a separate bus and joined a separate group for the JSA tour. If you are already going to commit time to doing a DMZ tour, you must book a JSA tour as well. Not all tour groups will offer this, so make sure you are specific. It is worth the extra time and worth the extra money. It is not a lengthy tour, but you basically get to be right next to the border of North Korea and see North Korean soldiers if they are outside. I would have been disappointed if we had only done the morning tour. For the JSA tour portion, you do have to abide by the set dress code, which is particularly an issue in the summer. No one in our group had any wardrobe issues, but our guide informed us that they had extra clothes on board just in case. Also, the morning tour guide said that the tourists who were not going on to the JSA tour were going to head back to Seoul and stop at an amethyst or ginseng tourist stop. This sounded to me like forced touristy-shopping that a lot of tour groups in Korea do in order to get a kick-back from the amethyst/ginseng stops. This would not have been something I would have wanted to spend my limited time doing. Be cautious when you are booking your tour to see if they spend time doing this.The only other tour group that I had looked at to do this tour was the USO Kooridor tour. This would have been my first choice but it was fully reserved. It was a little cheaper, and the buses were a little bit bigger from what I could tell. We were still satisfied with this tour and felt like we should take the time to do it since we were in the area. "
Tour DMZ - Panmunjom/JSA Tour,"We recently stayed for three days in Seoul and booked the Panmunjom tour (which included the JSA) with Tour DMZ.The booking process was easy, with quick replies via email to make the reservation. It was then a case of turning up at the Hotel President at 8.30am for a 8.50am departure on a large, comfortable bus - you were assigned specific seats.On the drive out towards the border you are given a lot of information about the tour and about the history of the conflict between North and South Korea. Our guide was fantastic and was happy to answer any questions. There was also a lot of information about the rules for the tour, given we were entering a military area.There were two passport checks before getting off the bus as you entered the DMZ and then the JSA area itself. This involved a South Korean soldier entering the bus and doing a quick passport and dress code check.You are then taken to a large lecture theatre type room where you are given a briefing, although a lot of this was the same info as was given on the bus drive. It is necessary to sign a declaration form at this point, then you go onto a military bus to be shown around the area. The highlight is the MAC conference room, which is a small room where military personnel from either side meet to discuss, and the border between North and South Korea literally runs through the middle of this room. As the room was not in use, we were able to go in and wander over to the North Korean side, and take some photos. The trip was fantastic and one of the most interesting I have ever done - would highly recommend."
Have to do it if near Seoul,"This is just one of those things I'd say is a must-do; the only consideration is which tour you visit Panmunjom on. The one I took was about 85,000 won and was from 8:30 - 2:30 (including transportation time). The main attraction for me was the conference room where you can step into North Korea. We had a tour guide basically all to ourselves because we were the only English speakers in a herd full of Japanese tourists. Good experience, a bit pricey, but worth it if you're at all interested in the history or relations of these two countries."
A foot in two countries,"For an unforgettable experience, the Panmunjom tour is second to none. Being driven around the most heavily armed area on the globe and on the border between two countries still at war, this tour is a must see. Enter the conference room where you can actually walk from South Korea to North Korea without being arrested! Don't miss this tour."
fascinating and depressing,"All of the stops in our DMZ - JSA tour were interesting and educational, but the highlight of the tour, at least for me, is the Panmunjom (JSA). This part of the tour is my absolute favourite because I felt the unexplainable tension between the North and South. I thought of all the people who died there during the Korean War, and all those who perished after the peninsula was divided. It was fascinating and depressing at the same time."
A must do when in South Korea,"If you're visiting Seoul you need to go the JSA in Panmunjon. You might never get that close to North Korea in your life unless you want to visit North Korea. It's amazing (and sad) to see this border. And yes, you're always watched by the North Korean guys. As you're under constant supervision by an American military guy you need to obey their orders. You are allowed to take pictures, don't worry. But still there are some rules to be followed (no waving, no hand gestures towards North Korea). "
Do not miss!!!,"If you are visiting Seoul, do not miss visiting this place. You will get closest to North Korea at the joint security area. You'll get to enter into one of the blue camp with half of the camp straddling over North Korea. This camp is the place where the North and South Koreans meet to discuss their differences. It was surreal to be so close to North Korea side and you can really feel the tense atmosphere with both the North and South Korean soldiers face off with each other just a few yards apart. A few international incidents have happened here before and this place has been visited by many foreign dignitaries giving their support to the soldiers who work in such a high security area. Do visit this place and get to know the history behind the Koreans. Security is very tight here and they vet you before you are allowed to book the tour. "
The highlight of the JSA tour,"This is a lifetime experience and the highlight of the JSA tour. A registration 3 days in advance is required and there are only 6 travel agencies in South Korea, who are allowed to operate tours to the JSA. Make sure you have your passport with you, otherwise they will not let you in.Once the half day DMZ tour is finished and lunch was eaten, the bus takes you to Camp Bonifas, where the busses are switched (UN busses driven by military personnel) each bus gets a US Army solider who will explain the rules (90% of the JSA is a no photo zone) and is also there to support/protect the group.I felt like in school as we had to stand in one line on the stairs facing the north and had to form a line of two once walking into the UNMAC T2 conference building. This is the one divided by the border in between, so technically you are in North Korea once crossing the table. Unfortunately you only get to spend approximately 10 minutes in the conference room and afterwards are taken to the Axe Murder incident site (the memorial plague is still there, the tree not anymore) and the Bridge of no return. These two can only be pictured from the bus.Conclusion: this tour is definitely worth the €100 it costs and I was also satisfied with the service and organization done by the tour provider (Seoul City Tour)"
Worth the visit. Choose this one instead of going to the DMZ tour. This one is way awesome!,"PROS: Amazing experienced. Visited this place on my birthday last November 17. The place was very strict but understandable because of the situation right now between both North & South Korea. Totally worth your money because you'll be able to land-feet on both side of Korea on their crucial border. If you are into geography, history and awesomeness this is the best tour for you.CONS: Limited timePRICE - 4/5LOCATION - 3/5HOSPITALITY - 4/5SAFETY - 4/5"
Rare experience and provably most tense situation,Really a once in a lifetime experience to see the north communist side of korea. Its interesting to see how well guarded the South is to ensure the safety of its citizens . Its also very cool as you have a military escort of which will accompany you around the camp.
The closest you will come to North Korea!,"The Joint Security Area or Panmunjom tour is the most fascinating tour you can take in Korea. It is filled with tension but highly recommended to anyone visiting Seoul. You enter the conference room which is divided in the middle as one side of the room is South Korea and the other side, technically North Korea! There are South Korean soldiers on both sides which you can have your photo taken with. And outside are the North Korean soldiers peeping in through the windows! The reason you can ""cross"" into North Korea is that the room is controlled by the UN. Great tour which puts into perspective the tension between both countries."
Worth visiting when in Seoul.,"Panmunjom would be your best choice instead of doing the whole DMZ tour. Panmunjom is where the demarcation line is between the two Koreas and you could really feel sad at how such division like this exists. We have travelled via PTC that leaves from Lotte Hotel, they are efficient and reliable. Highly recommended tour."
Visited during DMZ tour.,It is a fascinating and serious part of DMZ tour. Panmunjon is 55 miles from Seoul and you have to be a part of organized group to come here. We received instructions regarding respectful and conservative dress code for entering the Joint Security Area .
Feel the tension! Awesome tour!,"I visited the JSA with the KTB tour that leaves the Lotte Hotel. They ask you to get here for 0830 and the tour leaves around 9. It can be a bit chaotic so suggest you get there in plenty of time. We had 2 groups on the bus... a larger English speaking group and a smaller Japanese group so we had 2 guides which did lead to some noise pollution as both did their commentary but it was not unbearable. On the road to the JSA takes about 75 mins and our guide was quite charismatic about Korean history and gave us some background to the war. She also outlined the rules around being granted access to the JSA and what could happen to the tour if we break them (i.e. cancelled immediately). Basically follow all instructions, only take pics when instructed that it is allowed and dress conservatively.The highlight is access to the border meeting rooms which are shared between north and south. You get the chance to stand on the NK side of the room and take a picture with the South Korean soldiers. This is a living relic of the Cold War and you can definitely feel the tension. When we were there there were numerous North Korean soldiers also present on the opposite side which is not always the case. Then amazingly a tour group appears on the steps of the North Korean building. All very bizarre.Time here is limited but enough to savour the moment and get the photos. Onwards there was a drive past the ""bridge of no return"" and on to lunch which was very tasty (exceeded my expectations!). Did not do the DMZ / tunnel tours so can't comment but be careful if you are booking a DMZ only tour it may not include the JSA which is the main event."
Utterly surreal and a must see,"You have to go on an organised tour of the DMZ and JSA, plenty of options to choose from - I went with the USO tour that leaves Seoul early. Very knowledgeable guide, as well as the American MP who supervised us around the JSA. A fairly packed day but well worth it."
Visit to JSA,"We went on a tour of the JSA (joint security area) in the DMZ (or what should be demilitarized). We were supposed to have a private tour, but it turns out that only full bus loads are allowed in so you got the choice of pick up in Seoul at 7 am in the morning or you can get pick up by private car at 8 am and meet the bus at the border at 0930 to save you an hour of sleep. Trip up to border from central Seoul (we stayed at Lotte Hotel) is about 1 hour. Dont forget to bring your passport. It gets checked several times. First at the border itself and then again on the way back. First off is a briefing in a big meeting room and people with too short skirts got longer ones to put on and open shoes got alternative shoes. Then walk to the JSA border where you stand eye to eye with the North Koreans, but take pic quickly as they normally go inside their buildings when tourists turn up. You then get to go into the blue buildings in the middle, and technically cross into North Korea. Then after that back in bus to the border of DMZ. They got other things tagged on to the tour, but we chose to go back to Seoul for lunch instead. Please remember that you need to apply for these tours well ahead of time as they do security check."
"Unique, once in a lifetime experience!",You have to book a tour to go there. It's really really intense. So glad we got to do it though. I would do it over again in a heartbeat. We also got to see and speak to a defector from North Korea. Great experience!
Must Do,"A visit to the JSA is what many people think about when they book their trip to the DMZ (they're not the same). Make sure you visit the Korean War Memorial before hand, so you have a better sense of everything.There's a video that you have to watch, which in my opinion, should be shown on the bus to the JSA rather than in a big hall.Views and the taking of photos of the Bridge of no Return can only be done from the bus and not on the ground. You do get to see the JSA up close, but then you're quickly hustled into the Conference room where you can take photos and then hustled out.I think the trip is too expensive for what it is and I think some of the soldiers are there for show (when tourists arrive), but that's just my opinion. It's still a worthy trip."
I went there while AD with the American Air Force. Very intimidating place. The North Koreans do their level best to a, I went there while stationed in South Korea with US AT. Very nerve wracking. We had to make a instructional stop before actually being allowed into Panjonum. Our group was entirely AD American military. The North Koreans do everything imaginable to try and intimidate you. Glowering'pointedSee the DMZ
Once in your life,Jsa trip is one of the great experience. You will feel strictly when you access inside the area. The conference room is one of the best part. 
A fascinating tour to the DMZ/JSA,"We booked our tour through Cosmojin and had S.P. as our guide. Everything about the tour was perfect (from what to wear-conservative clothes, please-to the itinerary and history and background). We felt we really got our money's worth from the tour.All the places you'll visit are in the top 7 of Things to Do in Paju. Some you'll find more interesting than others.I was pretty impressed how close we were to everything (including death judging by the waiver we had to sign) and it does tend to give you involuntary shivers every now and then.Book this in advance of your visit to Seoul to make sure there's time to check your passport/clear you for the DMZ/JSA tour. It's worth it."
Excited experience about North & South Korea,"It's a great experience to visit this Panmunjom (JSA). You will get close to the North Korea while standing in the area of Seoul Korea. But it's better to take the tour course here... Very convenience....

Panjumon travel center ,Im sure the dmz would have been interesting if it weren't for the pushy tour guide we were lumped with. Ms lee basically rushed us through the entire day. Impatient and aggressive sums her up. Buses used by panjumon travel center are ancient. We hit the road in a bus with no air conditioning. ..as ms Lee noticed our grumbling she guaranteed a newer cooler bus later. We got a second bus...it was just as old and just as hot. On the way home the bus broke down! !!!! We had to take a taxi to our hotel at my own expense! ! She kept saying bus fixed soon etc... but imagine....this was the hottest week in seoul all year and this company fails to provide 21st century transport with air con. Ms lee is extremely biased in her views and her English is incomprehensible for the most part. God knows how non-native speakers of English could understand her. She never stops talking. ..no time to think about your surroundings. We were glad to get away from this company. Very unprofessional. 
History Made Real,There are not many places you can visit that bring history to life and emphasize the truth of a very challenging historically significant situation. The Korean War is not talked about that much and too many people only think of M*A*S*H when they think of Korea. This is a live war zone and the reality is that many US and South Koreans have been killed by an imbalanced North Korea now led by a 3rd generation fanatic. This is the only Communist dynasty in the world and it is ground zero of the most unstable spot in the world.
A Must See experience from Seoul,"This is a fantastic place to visit and really helps you understand what is going on between North and South Korea. It is one of the most intense places I have been. The North Korean's are watching everything! They even stopped our bus as they thought someone took a photo of the NK guard tower, which is prohibited! U.S. Marine then inspected the other tourist's camera to confirm everything was ok. Definitely worth a day trip to do this and the 3rd infiltration tunnel and peace park."
Surreal and Intense!!!,The most intense place I have ever visited! It is surreal what is going on across the border that is in view. There are many restrictions on what you can and cannot wear and no pointing. North Korea is always watching and could use pictures of you in propaganda.A must see location when you come to South Korea.
Panmunjom worlds most heavily armed border!,"Very interesting, I enjoyed this tour very very much! you get an inside look at the most militarized border in the world between the North and South Korea, just divided by a thin white painted line.Included in the tour is a visit to the ""unification observatory"" , explanation of the conflict, lunch, viewing of the DMZ and a view from afar of a North Korean Propoganda Village flagpole.Also within part of the tour, there was North Korean defector, where she explains how she escaped and to whom one can ask questions (she doesn't speak English, but out Tour Guide was able to to translate)We got to see one North Korean soldier and many U.S. and South Korean soldiers, some of which where observing the North Korean soldier through binoculars. I wish I could have seen more DPRK soldiers, yet that is obviously not I anyone's hands. There are rules:1) Reserve many days (6-7 days) in advance there is limited availability.2) Sandals/open shoes, jeans with holes, Bermudas/shirt pants and skirts are not allowed. 3) You have read and sign a one sheet visitor declaration, just for the purpose that you will abide by the rules and not go to the North Korean part of the border (I doubt anyone will do this anyway LOL)."
Beware: tour can be cancelled,"The reason I have given this a poor rating is not because I don't think these tours are any good, but simply because you need to be aware that the tour can be cancelled just as you arrive at the Military camp (Camp Bonifas). We arrived a few days after the recent land mine explosion which injured 2 S Korean soldiers, a day before National Independence Day and the subsequent reaction by S Korea to start re-broadcasting propoganda messages across to the North. So things are/were not great - and they believed that it was not safe for us to continue.So, our JSA tour was cancelled - and we were told at the camp. The tour (half-day JSA only tour) offered us a chance to return back to Seoul or to do the other DMZ attractions (3rd tunnel, Dorasan observatory and station, & Imjingak - a cheaper tour). Just one thing to note: It can be cheaper - though more expensive time-wise - to do the two tours (DMZ general tour and JSA tour) separately. I paid around 120,000Won separately, but the standard price for a combined tour is 138,000 or thereabouts.If you are going to the JSA, you will need dress as conservatively as you can - the tour company will tell you what the rules are, but sandals, shorts, short skirts, ripped jeans, and anything other than a shirt/T-shirt will not be accepted."
Book the JSA tour from the Panmunjom Travel Center,"The JSA tour was very good. To summarize it:- Tour starts at Lotte Hotel (the tour companies have their offices on the 6th floor)- Take the JSA (Panmunjon) tour. The normal tour is acompanied by a North Korean defector and you can ask everything you always wanted to know about that strange country in the North- Tour price was 77.000 KRW/person- There was NO visit of a tourist trap like gem factories etc you can read about on the web from other tour companies. - You need to send your passport number in advance when you book the tour- Security is quite strict (closed shoes, no clothing that might be offensive like mini skirt etc)- At the barrack where the two countries meet for negotiation it is not allowed to take pics of certain areas. - Our tour guide was a very nice girl who spoke pretty good English. She also translated our questions to the lady who had escaped from North Korea. - Lunch was included, very delicious and they had a veggie Bibimbap optionConclusion: We chose the right tour company. I can absolutely recommend Panmunjon Travel Center.Here the mail address to contact them: jsa33@korea.com"
Joint Security Area,Highlight for my whole korea trip. Unfortunately I didn't managed to see the north korean soldier at the border. Such a disappointment.But it's definitely a worth going trip.Do remember to book the trip in advance as your name is required to be submitted for security clearance before entering the place.
Very classy display.,South Korea has truly honored the sacrifice of those from over twenty countries who fought alongosde them to ensure their freedom. This entire area is very classy and dignified unlike the North Korean side which we also visited and where they just outright lie about the whole war.
One in a lifetime,"Eye opening experience. I booked my tour with Koridoor and it was so worth it. If you go to Korea for any reason, you can not miss this. You can actually be in North Korea if you do this tour (once you're inside the UN building).This place shows what happened in the past and the guides also tells you the stories of the past. The roads leading up to this place was quite scary. Wired fences, bombs and other traps are every where. You have to listen to the military guide at all times. You are not allowed to take pictures of certain things for military reasons. The guide was very informative. The knowledge you acquire in this tour is amazing. The past and the present are very negative. But lets hope the future will be very very positive."
Emotional sight seeing,"This place is a great alarm clock to people mind towards world leader's greedy political ambitions.It is a great reminder for the people the ""high cost of war"". This place shows what becomes the lives of people as a result of few men's act. Looking at the wired fences is the result of the cruel greedy ambitions of world politicians.The tourists guides just explain the Korean war but not depth info on who or what causes the war exactly :0My greatest hope is the one day these two countries come together again and let the families be united in a peaceful non-armed way."
Unique Experience you won't forget,"You can only book this tour through Koridoor.co.kr and the price is a little steep, but this is the only way to see the border of North and South Korea and the UN facilities. Your guide will be professional and informative. I was looking forward to buying some North Korean money at one of the shops. Also, they sell some North Korean alcohol too. All in all, unique and unforgettable"
DMZ/JSA = once in a lifetime!,"Did the tour to JSA/DMZ with Koridoor and the trip was absolutely worth every penny. Apparently not all the tours go to JSA, which was the most interesting part of the tour, so make sure you get to go there as well! We left Seoul in the morning with bus and the tour guide was very friendly and provided good information about the schedule of the day and security matters. When we arrived closer to the border the guide stayed behind and we got taken to the military base where we were provided with good instructions about how to behave and history of the Koreas. Then we went to JSA, which is the joint security area, where we could actually see to North Korea, and the soldiers from the other side were actually watching us too (which was a bit daunting), but you are given good instructions about how to behave, so stick to them! You get to go inside the UN building as well, where you can actually step to the ""North Korean"" side! Afterward we went to a look out point to North Korea, then saw the bridge of no return. Then drove to Dorasan train station and last but not least we went to the DMZ area where we were shown a video of the history of Koreas (this we found to be a bit too far taken. Instead of being purely history it felt like being brainwashed.. Lastly we went down to the 3rd tunnel before heading back to Seoul. We had food near the Dorasan station where you could choose either vegetarian on meat bibimbap. Definitely a once in a lifetime experience."
DMZ/JSA,"JSA or Panmunjom was worth the time and money! Really great, educational, and heart-wrenching to witness political division at its finest. DMZ was okay, worth a miss actually."
JSA tour,"The driver fetched us from the hotel by 7:40 AM then we headed to Lotte Hotel for registration. By 8:50 we were on our way to JSA. It was about an hour to get there. It took us time to get inside because the security or personnel had to check all our passports and our dress or attire one by one. We visited first the freedom house, conference building, panmugjak Of North Korea and Bridge of No return. We even stopped at the exact location of the ""tree chopping incident"".I strongly recommend this tour than DMZ if you can only do one tour. Cosmojin did a great job for our tour."
Amazing experience,"We can feel the tension when the tour bus approached Panmunjom, the Joint Security Area. We had to pass through three checkpoints with ID visual check by solders before entering the camp. Once we entered the camp, we’re escorted straight to the Military Armistice Commission Conference Room (the Blue house) where talks between UN and North Korean were taken place in the past. South Korean ‘rock’ solders were posted both in and outside of the Conference Room. From there we can see North Korean border facilities and solders. We’d been in numerous occasions being reminded NOT to “finger pointing towards North Korea direction” but we’re allowed to take photos there.The whole group of tourists was ushered to leave the conference room after hanging around for about ten minutes and that also ended our JSA tour. The JSA tour it’s a privileged to foreign tourist as South Koreans are almost impossible to go there. According to our DMZ tour guide, South Korean who wishes to become a JSA guide has to undergo scrutinized background check. Visiting JSA and Demilitarized Zone let you know more about the sad history of Koreans. The tour might be organized somewhat dramatically but it’s still an extraordinary experience."
Incredible experience,"My girlfriend and I booked a tour with Cosmojin, the tour was very well organised, a dour military escorts very I formative and professional. Fascinating to see the contrast between the two Koreas. Make sure you book early (min 48hrs) because the UN officials need to check your passport etc ahead of time."
