Fares more costly to Busan subway,"Convenient LRT system to Gimhae airport, Busan. Punctual but costs more than subway system for distance travelled.Clean and simple system but do lookout for the direction to travel .connected to subway at sasang station for subway line 2."
Awesome adventure!,"These mutts were not surprised at the technology advancement that South Korea is know for world wide, and boy, now we know why they are awesome in many ways! You don't have to read or speak Korean at all! If you go up to the ticket self service booths equipped with 'touch screens', and one of two things are going to happen: (1) You'll see the ""English"" and proceed. (2) a metro 'volunteer' will come over and ask you what language you speak, and will enthusiastically help you! We quickly learned to say in Korean, ""Thank you, but we're familiar with the process! Look, someone needs your help!"" These mutts love to learn on their own, and that way it ""sticks"" to our furry brains! Nevertheless, Busan-GLR transist is #1!!! WiFi is available, and the 'announcement voice' states each stop in Korean, Chinese, and English! We never encounter any delays, and moved at the speed of the Korean workforce! I noticed that no one posted a picture of the screen, and we noticed right away that the ""ENGLISH"" button is located on the upper right hand corner of the touch screen! After selecting it, the machine spoke in English!"
Excellent service,Our hotel was near the airport so we used this service daily and it was always excellent. Great link to the metro.
The Next Best Thing To The Subway Going All The Way To The Airport,"Coming from the city you will have to pay another KRW 1400 but what else would you use? There are buses but they are best left to an advanced visitor, if you are not familiar with them. This is a safe bet ensuring you won't get lost. I enjoyed the final elevated view of Busan as well.It's safe, clean and easy to use. What's not to like?"
Comfortable move from Gimhae Airport,Tried this to move from Gimhae Airport to Gwaebeop Renecite.It was clean and comfortable.Amazing experience to run on the rail locating high from the ground which is rare in Korea.
Good to get into the city,"Briefly used it while getting from Busan Airport to the city. Fast and efficient, we travelled on it for 2-3 stops before we had to transfer to the Busan Metro. About 5 min walk from Airport arrivals to the LRT station. "
In English,"This was super fast and in at least 3-4 languages (English, Chinese, Japanese, and of course Korean). There were easy instructions on how to get tickets, pretty clear directions and names on maps, and lots of escalators and elevators for those suitcases we all have. We were on it at around 5am. It opens early and stay open late. "
Efficient and cheap way to go to Gimhae,"The best way to get to airport fast and cheap. If you don't stay near any LRT station, there is always a possibility to get on an MRT to the connection station."
Pleasant travel to reach the city,"From the airport, it was easy to locate the entrance station. As we have the t-money card with us, we just tapped the card as payment for the ride. There were announcements apart from the panels indicating the stations we will be reaching, thus we were well informed. We alighted at the transfer station before moving on to take the subway. And yes, we tapped the card again when exiting the LRT"
If you heading to or from Gimhae International Airport....,"If you heading to or from Gimhae International Airport....chances are you will use the Light Rail Transit which connects seamlessly to the Busan Metro and is fast, efficient and regular. "
Efficient linkage to the city Metro/Subway,I felt that the light rail was a very efficient way to link to the city subway. The automatic ticket vending machines are user friendly and easy to use.
Easy acces to main Busan subway/train system,"After I land, I purchase a ticket (a small electronic token) to the nearest transfer station. Very simple and easy to use. Almost never crowded."
overhead train in busan near the airport,this lrt train is connected to line 2 of subwayyou can also visit homeplus and emart using this lrtthis train can also bring u to gimhae city in busan
Good transportation from Airport to other locations in Busan.,This line takes you to many locations in Gimhae and Busan. However to get to more central Busan you will need to transfer from the BGLR. Used from airport and to airport and had no problems at all.
Efficient and economical,"It's really convenient and cheap to take this light rail transit. If you aren't carrying much luggage and not in a hurry (since you need to transfer to some metro station), this is the way to go. It's not hard to figure how to use it since there are English signs and transit personnel to assist you."
convenient&cheap transport from airport to busan city,"take LRT from gimhae airport to sasang. From sasang, take metro train to busan city. very convenient & cheap. "
Easy access from Airport,"Good option if coming from the airport. But a bit confusing when transferring to Sasang Subway, need to add for escalator or elevators."
Great way to get to and from the airport,"After an initial struggle learning how to top up the T-card to ride the train, learning the LRT system was easy and the trains were very comfortable and fast. Trains are relative frequent and a great way to travel around Busan. This particular one links Busan and GImhae airport. Very handy to have around. "
Use it everyday - never get tired of it,I ride the light rail from the end of line 3 to Deokdu station to get to work. The trains and stations are always clean and serviceable. Only problem I ever have is with the card readers sometimes failing to read my card when I rush through and throwing the doors closed on my knees - very aggravating. I prefer the turnstile systems in the metro.
"Easy to use, efficient, and clean","I like how easy it is to get to the airport station by the light rail. Trains run regularly, they are well maintained and clean. I was staying near the Busan Station metro stop, so i had to do a transfer to line 4, and then another transfer to the light rail line. I had the 20-subway-rides metro card and a Cash Bee card, and I somehow knew that the 20-rides card would not be accepted on the light rail, so I had 5000 won on the Cash Bee card. It all worked out beautifully. Quick, easy, and cheaper than a taxi. Definitely recommend it."
Efficient transport system,"Please to note that you can only use the LRT as one line. The nearest connecting station to the city is Sasang and for that you need to get a Metro ticket, totally different system. In total you have to pay KRW2,600 or KRW2,800 depending on which zone you are heading to."
