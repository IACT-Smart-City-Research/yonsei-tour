Awesome hiking trails with a view.,Enjoyed the hike along the coastline with beautiful view of the ocean. The trail is fairly easy and has a few exit and rest area overlooking the ocean. Cherry blossoms can be seen all along the pathway at Dalmaji Hill when in season.
Natural Beauty,"If you’re visiting Busan, especially the Haeundae Beach area visiting Dalmaji is a welcome break. On the northern side of Haeundae Beach is a beautiful set of hiking trails, cafés, and restaurants. Hugging the rocky coastline you will find historic trees and sweeping views of the popular beach area. It’s a highly recommended excursion from the lights and crowds."
Beautiful views but can be quite a hike if you are out of shape,Great views of the ocean and surrounding area. Can be a peaceful walk as most people can't handle the hill so it won't be crowded until you get to the top.
"Non-Blossom Season is Meh, go for the top gazebo and cafes nearby","Going in between seasons without the blossoms was a mistake. The road was too long for me to squeeze into a trip and the only good aspects left to see were the sea-side paths and the traditional gazebo at the top of Dalmaji Hill. If you find yourself visiting at this kind of time, I recommend going right for the gazebo, as the restaurants and cafes in the vicinity are located close to it."
Cherry Blossom along Dalmaji Road,A nice walk along Dalmaji Road and it leads to Haeundae Beach. The cherry blossom was very pretty at end March.
Take a short hike,"Pretty spot for pictures, but the best part to me was a short hike on the Moontanroad trail which makes you feel like you’re in the forest and not in a huge city. One of my favorite moments of my trip to South Korea. "
Pretty Dalmaji,Seaside views and really pretty views. We passed by this on the BUTI bus and if time permits can spend some time just to soak in the views!
Cherry Blossoms galore,"We drove by and stopped for pictures, there were cherry blossoms galore. If we had more time, it would have been great to walk around and perhaps stop for tea. Sun was near setting and you can see views of Haeundae Beach. "
Historical and cultural spot in Busan for cherry blossoms,"Nice little spot in the city where the cherry blossoms bloom each year. There are some nice walking paths as well along the area. It's worth a stop by if you're near, especially during cherry blossom season."
WANT TO MAKE A STRONG IMPRESSION WITH YOUR LOVE?,"The coffee shops here can offer a fantastic view of the ocean, and for a steep price, get the cake, too!!"
Most romantic view of Busan,"Dalmaji means road of meeting Moon. It's been popular visiting vista point for lovers in busan for past hundreds of years. Even many artists or famous tv stars have 2nd relaxing homes and condos here. You can see world class beach haundae with 7 star hotels, apec building, diamond bridge in gwangan beach and so on. This dalmaji area has all kinds of cafes and restaurant for your desire for hunger ! Can't go wrong with spectacular view here. I brought my business partners from Holland, Singapore, Japan and USA. Every one loved this unique hidden spectacular view place! Bring your beloved ones!"
A TIRING WALK,"Nothing much without the autumn leaves, only rows of nice houses! Missed the moon or sun raise. If you have not enough stamina, leave it."
One of the best spots to enjoy Haeundae view,"Although I categorized all my photos as Dalmaji-gil Road, they were all taken on Moontan Road actually. Moontan Road is a tranquil trail beside Dalmaji-gil. Its entrance is located in the middle of Dalmaji-gil Road, so one can find it easily. Just take a few step beside and walk along the mountain trail. You can walk along the trail all the way, or go down to Old Busan Railroad. Both are the best view spots of Haeundae. Actually local travelers visit Moontan Road & the old railway much more than Dalmaji-gil Road. I don't know why they are not registered as attraction site on Tripadvisor."
"Sublime spring ride, and all year round","It’s a road that becomes a park when you don’t drive it, surrounded by trees, with a mountain easy to walk trail, well paved, offering you astonishing views of the sea and Haeundae beach; many people come here to stay and wait for magic moments for magic pictures, especially sunset,... and at spring its trees go crazy floury, amazingly colourful.... you just need to hit the cherry blossom season right, that lasts just 10 days! ... a great place to spend an afternoon, also with a big range of coffee shops and restaurants along the road. "
Worth visiting for the views and the mood when in Busan,"When in Busan , this is one of the spots worth visiting for the views and the mood . There are amazing sea views as you walk uphill , you can stop by in one of the many coffee shops there to enjoy a relaxed atmosphere or walk in the close-by forest as there are many small tracks easy to catch from the road side ."
Good trail for hiking,"Good trail for hiking, not to difficult. Nice path which easily to walk. You can see the below trail which is railroad trail. This trail is parallel to the railroad trail, but easier to walk. "
Complete Waste of Time,"Pictures of this place looked stunning during the cherry blossoms season. But when we went in September and at night, the place was eerily quiet and deserted. It looked like any normal suburb neighbourhood with a only handful of restaurants which were mostly with few or no customers. Would not recommend this place to anyone. "
Best thing I did in Busan,"I didn't like Busan very much, but this street is really really pretty! I was there in cherry blossom season and it's amazing, so many cherry blossom trees and a really nice walk along the ocean. Please go here and relax at a nice cafe."
Amazing in cherry blossom season,Its a amazing experience when walking along Dalmaj-gil road under the cherry blossom! All in full bloom that you could not take your eyes off them.
Sunrise view and cherry blossom,Went through early in the morning to catch the sun rise and to see the blooming cherry blossom. It was a pretty place and timing was right with the cherry blossoms at fully bloom. Went up the Holly coffee place that open 24x7 for morning coffee. Coffee was very much diluted but the place has outdoor balcony seats for great view of the cherry blossom and the park. 
Nice view,It is a nice place. we had to climb the hill before it came to this place. tailor-made course that is not slippery to avoid slipping.
We visit this place @ winter time. a breathtaking riding in Cable Car.OMG what a nice place when you were at the top....,Hahaha Just visit and injoy much snow fall at the top... maybe next time i try to visit it in natural season....
Nice Place to Walk,"I loved walking by this street, there are a lot of restaurants and cafes where you can take a break. You can also look at the sea, I really liked it. "
Nice place to view cherry blossoms,"Visit during the last week of March and first week of April to get a glimpse of beautiful cherry blossom trees along the road leading up to the pavilion. I have been here twice and though the road is slightly steep which can be tiring, there are a few cafes higher up for you to rest your feet. The pavilion is a good resting point too. Once you've reached the pavilion, the cafes are just over at the left."
Nice place to walk near Haeundae beach,"A very nice walk, the road is full of coffee shops and restaurants, very nice view to the sea. Has some parking area but gets busy on wekends."
"Pine Trees, Coffee Shops and Expensive Dining","As you climb the hill you have a constant view of the sea which is partially obstructed by a multitude of pine trees.Once you arrive at the (what I will call) business district of the hill you will have your choice of expensive coffee shops or expensive restaurants to dine in.There is not much shopping to be done, or really anything else to do there. Althogh there is a weekend market through certain months of the year with little handmade trinkets and jewelry, which again is overpriced, yet not really worth buying.Dalmaji is best for booking an upscale restaurant for a special occasion, and in my opinion, that is it. There are better hikes thoughout Busan and much better views of the sea."
A must-see in spring time,"The place is famous for its cherry blossom trees lining the road. At night they look stunning. However the road is heavily jammed after sunset (after about 6:30 pm) so one should try to go there early by taxi or on foot. It is very romantic at night despite the heavy traffic on the road (drivers don't horn, thank goodness)."
Better visit at night,When you go there in winter you will feel the fresh air while enjoying youth vibes in the beach. So peaceful and the scenery is very great. You can see the haeundae beach from above. Must visit at night!
Not quite as advertised,"My wife and I jumped into a taxi after dinner and asked to be taken to Moontan Road and eventually were dropped near the entrance to the path, which we found almost by accident.Despite all the puffery about moonlight-like strolling, the path is not well light and presented some concerns about falling (tree roots and slipping surface) although I was much less worried than my wife.At night there is just nothing to see; heavy woods block the water views and for nervous nellies the darkness may be off-putting.It might be better to forgo the so-called ""moonlight"" and walk it during the day?"
Missed the cherry blossoms blooming ,We missed the cherry blossoms blooming time. So all we could see was two rows of trees. I can imagine how beautiful it could have been if the cherry blossoms are in full bloom.We took a slow walk along the road. There are some nice cafes with interesting buildings to check out along the stretch. The coast was awesome. There is actually a tourist information counter which you can find out what you could do there. Had wanted to check out the railway track but gave up as we were rushing to go outlet shopping nearby. Nice place to rest and get a drink. 
Very good location to view Blooming Cherry,"It was very leisure to walk from top of the Dalmaji-Gil Road downward to metro station. Along the road, the full blooming Cherry flowers were attracting your eyes and everywhere were photo shooting locations. The wooden Boardwalk, added the romatic feeling when you passing through it. If you felt tired, there were lot of cafes and restaurants. Most of them with good views to see the blooming cherry. "
Getting there ,Take line 2 to Jangsan station. It's a long uphill walk so take a taxi and drop off at the hill top (dalmaji hae wol jung ) and have an easy walk back down. Just 3000 krw. Come in April and it's lovely with overhanging branches of cherry blossoms. Many food outlets here too. 
Pretty in April with Cherry Trees in Bloom,"I walked up this road from Haeundae beach to view the cherry blossoms in April. The trees were in full bloom, so it was very pretty. Traffic was backed up. There were a few nice spots to look down at the beach from the road. Near the top there were cafes and shops and a tourist info center. I enjoyed seeing the cherry trees, but otherwise, not sure what else there was in the area as I didn't have time to explore."
Not too exciting,"It seemed as though there were just a bunch of cafes and restaurants, which were pretty in their architecture but the road seemed unpopular and lackluster overall."
Haeundae Dalmaji-gil Road,"Haeundae Dalmaji-gil Road is nice area to grab a cup of coffee, you can also take a nice relaxing walk on this road with cool atmosphere"
maybe better to see in Spring,went here December 2015. there wasnt much to see nor much going on. I think this road is known for its cherry blossoms during springtime. pass by this area only if you are in the mipo terminal area otherwise you may be disappointed. Donbu Namhae railroad is much better to see instead.
"dalmaji, dalmaji......","We have mixed reactions about this place perhaps this place will be very interesting to visit during Spring or Fall. Plenty of cafes to choose from , and quite a good place to have a good cup of coffee and relax."
A must visit while in Busan,"It was situated in a quaint, quiet neighborhood, great for morning walk. Felt peaceful and at ease with friendly and helpful people who lived nearby. Dont forget to walk down the defunct railway tracks, great for pictures! After a walk down Dalmaji Hill and Moontan Rd, you can proceed to Haeundae Beach which is situated a stone's throw away."
Beautiful View along the Road and Train Track,"The view along Dalmaji Road during early November is not as nice as during Spring as seen in pictures posted online. None the less, it is still breathtaking and romantic. Be sure to go down to the abandunt train track for the return journey. It is quite unique to walk along the train track that ran along the sea shore."
Beautiful views from Dalmaji road!,"Definitely come here! if you're doing the hike (which btw doesn't contain of course coffee places), it takes around 1 hour give or take. If you start it from east Dalmaji it's a bit difficult to find the beginning as everything's in Korean. Just look for a walking trail into the woods, and eventually you'll find signs and a map showing you the route. Beautiful view along the hike of the forest and the ocean, and there's an amazing viewpoint in middle of hike."
Charming Area,This place is a very nice area to sit at a cafe and relax or go for a nice hike. It is a very peaceful area and would recommend visiting this area if you are around the Haeundae area. My wife and I walked about 20-30 minutes to this area from Haeundae Beach. It is a very charming area to walk around and we stopped at a cafe and had a some coffee and relaxed.
FOR A MEAL OR A COFFEE,"Dalmaji is a great place to having a coffee in the afternoon, lunch or a romantic dinner! Very interesting Restaurants in different price ranges."
One of the best places to experience Cherry Blossom in Busan.,"Dalmaji-gil is one of the best places to experience Cherry Blossom in Busan. I had an opportunity to see the cherry blossoms this year and it was great. Apart from Cherry Blossom season, it's a good place to take an evening stroll or a brisk jogg in the morning."
Cherry Blossoms Road!!!,We missed it!! Just by 3 weeks I think but still caught a few trees with the lovely pink flowers. It must have been a lovely sight when the cherry blossoms are in full bloom!
Nice place for a walk and plenty of coffee shops.,"Basically a tree lined road which runs along the cliff. It seems to be famous for having lots of coffee chain stores such as Starbucks, Angel-in-us, etc. There are a few other restaurants too. I'm not sure I would call it a tourist attraction as such but if you were looking for somewhere to have a coffee in Busan this would be the place."
Nice walk downhill to Haeundae Beach,We visited this place during the cherry blossom period and the road was lined with trees with beautiful flowers. We were running out of time so we took a taxi from the metro station to Dalmaji Road. We enjoyed the walk to Haeundae beach which took about half and hour.
Happening place :),"This hill is popular for its cafes, and there just too many of them. The choice become hard, but a particular ox bone noodle soup shop & cafe pascucci were some that we tried. And both were good. Since I went at the time of the Cherry Blossoms, the attraction was diverted to the trees along the driveway that brings you up the hill. The denisty of the trees and the colors just amazed me!"
Basically for cherry blossoms,You get to see lots of cherry blossoms when they are in season. Some of the usual cafes but nothing much more
A good walk along the scenic,"We took a cab to the peak, and chose the down slope path towards haeundae. A good walk to enjoy the breeze, houses, trees etc. "
Lots of things to in Dalmaji-gil,"The area is perfect. You can do hiking, running, even just having good time in a cafe. Great weather with the perfect scenery, what else can you ask for?"
Coffe Haven Hill,"Being a coffee lover, this is a place I'll always be coming back to in Busan. You can take a jog or walk from Haeundae or hop on a cab and take a 2 min ride to the hill and experience a view of Haeundae and Gwangalli Beach at the top or maybe from one of the coffee shop's veranda as you sip on your tea or coffee. They say you can see Japan's Daema Island on a clear day from here. "
Lovely walk after lunch,Worth visiting in busan. Have lunch at one of the restaurants asking the road and then walk it off with lovely sights! 
The walk on this road and then on Moon-tan was excellent,We highly recommend walking this road and then taking a right turn to Moon-tan. It was a fabulous path. We came out on a road and was able to get the #2 bus back to the metro. How great is that?
Nice shaded walking paths,"There are some really nice views and shaded areas with benches. The bottom closest to Haeundae Bch has a complicated intersection, so walkers watch out."
Moonlit Road,"Dalmaji (달맞이) Road means it's a road to enjoy the moon, I regret that I did not pay much attention to the moon when I was there, but the overall stroll/hike when I was there was very enjoyable.I went there twice, once with a Korean friend and once with a foreigner friend, the trekking area was just next to the busy road with cars but you won't be able to hear the exhaust noises one you set foot into the woods, it's just plain peaceful.If you do not prefer to do trekking, you can walk along the walking path next to the road and there are lots of cherry blossom trees planted along the Dalmaji road so if you come during spring time, I suppose it will be very beautiful!When I was there with my non-Korean friend, we end up lost in the trekking area but there were road signs so we managed to get out safely. It was a fun adventure even when we were finding our way out, it was already night and the trekking trail was lit up by small lights along the trail.If you pay enough attention to it, you can actually see that there were different crescent shapes of the moon during the moon cycle. There were also boards with horoscope explanation, so if you're up for it, go look for yours! :)There were also many cafes in this area, so if you want, you can just drop by and have a cup of coffee."
Splendid landscape and place for walk,very beautiful landscaping and views over the Haeundae shore and sea as well as the city. good place for walking and jogging. 
Beautiful cherry blossoms,"We went to Dalmaji Road in early April where the cherry blossom trees are in full bloom. Nice place to take pictures and soak in the cherry blossom atmosphere. To go to Dalmaji Road: From Haeundae subway station, we told the cab to bring us to Haewoljeong 해월정 (the pavilion at Dalmaji Road) which we paid 3,600 won. Dalmaji Road is a hilly road.From the pavilion we walk downwards back towards Haeundae Beach which takes about 20/30mins (more or less) depending how often you stop and enjoy the flowers. Dalmaji Road is also a good place to view Haeundae Beach from afar."
A great stroll,I walked along both Damalji and Moontan roads on a windy day and loved it... I had a really nice breakfast and enjoyed the local galleries...
Cherry blossoms everywhere in early April 2014,Cherry blossom tress in full bloom line both sides of the street. The is one area in Busan where you can see cherry blossoms and the beach.
Go for the cherry blossoms,"A lovely road to drive or walk down/up, especially in cherry blossom season. There are quite a few other 'cherry blossom streets' around Busan, too."
"Fantastic, must go !","My first visit to the Dalmaji Road, it is very famous for its beautiful cherry blossoms in early April. Just about 10-15 mins walk from the Haeundae Beach. It’s a nice, safe and quite easy walking trail, good for all ages. Along the walking trail, the scenery is fantastic, especially during the cherry blossom season."
Steep climb is walking,"We drove through and around this lovely area with the trees covered in their autumn cloaks. I guess other seasons would also be stunning with the numerous blossom trees and pines. Coffee culture at it's best with plenty of choice,small markets on the streets as well although not many.We came late afternoon as the sun was setting so a perfect place to view it from.We ended the drive near the two lighthouses where tents where set up to enjoy fresh seafood BBQ style. The scallops ,clams and mussels were divine,very basic restaurant Korean style ,charcoal braziers, a cold beer DIVINE"
A wonderful relaxing place,"I was first told about this place by my Seoul international taxi driver. My first visit was at night in search of a dinner place. I was not too successful and was uncomfortable at how dark the place was. Recently, I went there on a bright and sunny Sunday afternoon and had a great time. It was fun and relaxing to walk in the shade of the trees along the walkway and look across at Haeundae beach. There was a small handicraft fair on with many interesting small knick knacks on offer. As traffic was grid locked, we decided to walk down the slope to Haeundae beach instead of waiting for a cab. Before leaving we had a nice bingsoo at the Hotel Illua. The cafe had yummy looking baked goods too. It seems this is a great place for cherry blossoms viewing as there is some kind of forest walk which we saw but did not undertake. Definitely a return destination for us on the next visit to Busan."
Romantic getaway!,"A beautiful wooded walk set on the side of a mountain, overlooking the sea! Can it get better - yes. The legend goes that this spot is the favourite for couples on Full moon days, because a prayer to the Moon God (before he starts diminishing) would certainly get answered.The beauty of the walk is enhanced by the wood paved walkway, with wooden fencing along at least a couple of miles along the road. There are also wooden benches set here and there for relaxing.Across the road, away from the seaside, are numerous cafes with soft music wafting along. I guess the cafes are a necessary evil - even young lovers can get thirsty!"
A Place where you can get away from it all.,"A 10-15 min walk from Haeundae beach if u dont want to spend 3000 won for a cab ride. A place where you can get away from it all. Whether your're a mood for a walk, jog, run or just to kill time and enjoy the calming sight of the sea while sipping your cup of tea or coffe, this is definitely the right place for you! :)"
Walk to Water Temple,"You can walk along this road to get from Haeundae to the Water Temple, but it's nothing fantastic and there is a lot of construction which seems never ending."
