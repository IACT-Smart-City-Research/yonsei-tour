Historic Temple,"This temple is a bit trickier to reach compared to some other temples in the greater Seoul area, but is generally worth the trip. You can take a series of buses, of course, but the temple is also connected to some nice hiking trails that go right into Seoul. That's actually a pretty nice option."
trip back in time,This Buddhist temple is off the beaten path. But we'll worth the effort to get to. I'm told that it is over 800 years old. It is in the mountains near Uiwang. Though small it's very picturesque. I met a pair of monks who were very cordial. My wife translated our meeting. She told me that I was one of a few westerners who had visited this site . So join me and become a relatively exclusive club and visit this shrine. The ride up the to see it is special especially in the spring with the cherry blossoms open .
