I thought it was worth the drive,We left Busan and drove a little over an hour to get here. Parking was a little sparse. We took photos and spent about an hour in the area. We had coffee and cake at a nearby café.
Interesting place to visit,"This is another interesting place. There is a hand coming out of the water that makes for some great photos of the sunrise.There is a lighthouse museum, an outdoor display with some history/mythical story, a sea_life museum, pictures of Pohang from when it we just a fishing village and how it transformed into what it is now, and restaurants and street vendors."
The ocean and the sculptures ,"Visted there shortly with a friend living in Pohang to see the ocean and the hand sculptures. Famous place for sun rising, don’t go there New Year’s eve till New Year’s morning as it’s too much crowded. "
The Hand,"visited with a friend amazing during sunrise , there is 1 hand in the sea and 1 on land great place to take photos"
An interesting place... don't go for New Years,"Homigot Sunrise Plaza was pretty cool experience. The hand rising out of the water is definitely cool. But really... you can go and see it in 20 minutes, take some pictures and be done.We went for New Years for the sunrise festival. I thought it'd be something fun for our family to do instead of just staying in Seoul. I hadn't realized just how popular this event is/was. Sunrise was at 7:30, our hotel was 30 minutes away. We decided to leave our hotel at 5 AM. We didn't get to anywhere even near the plaza until about 8 AM. It is THAT busy. And we couldn't even turn around. We decided all the traffic and hassle wasn't worth it so we were just going to go back home and see it the next day, but had to sit through traffic since cars were parked on both sides of the road and in the median, there was literally nowhere to turn around. I'm glad there was no emergency, that person would be dead/SOL. Couldn't even head back to our hotel until about... 9 or so.Though sure enough, January 02. The place was dead. Got our pics and headed on back home to Seoul."
Interesting ,Interesting place but not worthy to ride hundreds of km to arrive. If you are in Pohang then this is fine place to visit. But from Seoul it may be not good decision to visit just for this place.
Good spot for photo op and coffee break,"It was worth going to see the hand statue coming out of the water, but it is more of a pit stop not much else to do, unless you are happy sitting by the sea. There is a good cafe and restrooms, so it is a good stop along the way, but you dont need the whole day here. You can travel on to Gyeongju from here where there are burial mounds and more to see and do."
Popular for locals but not much to see,"Billed as the first point on mainland Korea to be hit by the sun each morning this is a popular destination for locals. There are two huge hand sculptures and places to take pictures close to the water but I was underwhelmed. It is at least 40 minutes away from Pohang via curvy slow going roads. Parking is tight on weekends and unless you visit the nearby lighthouse museum, it is about a 15 minute stop. Not really worth the time and effort to reach the area. We did not attempt to visit at sunrise but my boys were unimpressed. "
A great good-to-know place,"Homigot is famous even among Koreans, but it's just like your typical tourist destination. Great for pictures but it would have been more awesome if there are more interactive experiences for visitors. Well of course there is a museum and there is this man-made teletubies hill that's also instagram-able. I was there in spring so the canola flowers were in bloom and there you got another instagram picture. Not forgot to mention the obligatory hand statue picture. Another fun while in the area is to visit an old Japanese village just 10-15 minutes ride away where you can rent out Korean/ Japanese costume while strolling through the conserved neighborhood."
Great Photo Op But That's It,"If you're in Pohang, it's kind if obligatory to go get a picture with the giant hand. However, I would only recommend it if you're staying for a good amount of time, because there is nothing else to do there. It's a pretty far car or bus ride, 1 1/2 - 2 hours from city center, and the only thing there other than the hand is a very small museum that is all in Korean."
A magical place,"More people should go to Pohang. And even more should make the bus or cab ride out to Homigot. The entire peninsula is fabulous, with its streets of seafood restaurants and cute parks. The Sunrise Plaza is the perfect place to start (at the beginning of the day), or end (at sundown). We were there in late October with the cold wind whipping off the ocean and the waves crashing violently. It was fantastic. Many people took pictures of the large hand sculptures, which are cooler in real life, and many still enjoyed the street food- ah! Beondegi! Get there in time to see the museums on the plaza and the lighthouse. A true gem!"
Hands up!,Quite far from downtown and limited bus to reach this place. Highlight the hand statues. Dont really love this because the cleanliness is not good but the view is good
Meh,"This plaza was just mediocre for us. The hands are definitely cool to see, especially the one in the ocean. I was just expecting something more. We were disappointed there was no beach or wading area and the water was actually dark and littered. We stayed long enough to browse a gift shop and take some pictures. It was really hot outside so we didn't explore anything outside of the plaza area, but it didn't look like there was much. Parking was free but very crowded. It's worth a stop if you are in the area but definitely not worth going out of your way to see."
Cape Homi in Pogang,"This is a famous place for greeting the sun on the first of January. Lots of people come here to see sunrises. Especially, photographers take pictures of them."
"Beautiful, must see","This is a very beautiful place. A must if you are in Pohang.You can see the strangest things to eat, and great views.Bring camera and walking shoes.Make sure you have a couple of hours, as there is a lot to see. (i had too little time( 1,5 hours))"
Scenic place,"If you visit pohang, this place is a must visit as there are nice scenaries around and there is a famuos arm in sea mounted by posco steel industries and the sunset at this place is good. And the way to reach this place from pohang very scenic. Overall nice place. There is a museum and horse riding. There is no option for us like indian vegetarian for food. If that was there then i would have rated excellent for this place."
A big hand for Homigot,"The bus ride from Pohang, changing at Gwangpo, was nice and easy. You would have needed a car to get there by sunrise, but that's been done rather a lot by other folk so we just went out for the afternoon. The Hands of Harmony are impressive, the seagulls look great sitting on the finger and thumb of th one in the sea. The toilet in the shape of a ship was quite funny. All very pleasant - as good and wholesome as you would expect an afternoon out in Korea to be. We stopped off at Gwangpo on the way back and managed to find the old Japanese fishermen's houses which made something to do between buses.Overall, two things made it for us. The famous hands and the nice people we met."
Hand of Harmony charm,"The Homigot is great place to visit - truly Korean cultural sight with legends about sea gods and goddesses, sunrise festival in the coldest season of the year, huge soup pot to feed the hungry masses, charming curio shop and a fantastic view of the bay from the Millenium building. Also, a very scenic (and cheap) bus ride from Pohang along the coastline. I did it in Spring and Summer, not sure if I could withstand the freezing Winter festival on New Years!"
