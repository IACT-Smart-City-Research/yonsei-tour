Oldest temples from the Shilla dynasty!,Bulguksa temple is one of the UNESCO world heritage sites in the world. It has seen a lot of wars-destroyed and built again. The stone pagodas are still maintained and are an insight of how life has been in the ancient years.The temple itself encompasses the Korean Buddhist art from the Shilla dynasty. It is easily accessible by public transport as it's one of the major tourist attractions of Gyeongju.
Beautiful grounds and temple,"We enjoyed an afternoon walk around the temple grounds. The trees were still in bloom the end of November and were so vibrant and pretty! Fees are 5,000w/ adult and 2,500w/child. Pretty bridges with waterfalls made for stunning photos. We spent less than an hour here so made for a nice outing."
Massively beautiful,"A very expansive property including both Gardens and enormous Temples, Statues, and Prayer notes. Actually more things to comprehend than a several hour visit allows.Very colorful. But you need to look up and also closely at all the details."
Gyeongju UNESCO World Heritage Temple,We take bus no 11 from town to Bulguksa Temple. we enjoyed the slow scenic walk up the temple. Nice and peaceful place to visit
Active temple with praying monks ,We spent a couple of hours here wandering in and out of the various temples and paid the extra 2000 won to go into the new museum within the temple complex. The museum was quite good and all the explanations were also in English. There was a tea shop too (quite expensive by local standards) which we didn’t try but the menu looked quite good. It was fairly busy on a Tuesday in November.....I can imagine it might get very busy in high season. 
scenic walk up,"We took the city tour bus which also include the Seokguram Grotto, two tombs and a shrine. we enjoyed the slow scenic walk up the temple. Beautiful autumn trees lined the place and the weather was great. Nice and peaceful place to visit"
So colourful ,"I enjoyed the walk up from the bus station. My favourite part was the colourful lanterns, all the colours of the rainbows "
Very scenic in autumn ,"Like most Korean temples and palaces, this is a total rebuild. It is in use for worship and has a certain atmosphere about it, enhanced by lovely gardens. An easy bus ride from Gyeongju."
Wow and a sunny day,We took an earlyish bus from town in the morning so when we arrived there were very few people there. Great location and interesting temple to visit. On a sunny day its beautiful.
One of the most beautiful temple in S. Korea,"This wide complex of temples is amazing. It is located in the gyeongju national park. Besides being a beautiful temple, the nature around is luxurious."
Magnificent Structure and Gardens,"With a number of specific Buddha temples we were privileged to hear monks chanting prayers in each one. The hypnotic rhythms echoed beyond the temple walls. The grounds are beautiful with gateways framing views of stately trees. Also there is a beautiful large pond. The buildings, themselves also have a majestic presence."
Truly worth the visit.,Lovely grounds - lots of children on field trips but that just reinforces what a great spot this is.
Massive Temple Complex,This is a sizable temple complex with numerous temples. There is some walking and a fair amount of steps involved. The place can be peaceful when not too crowded. It was great to learn some history and see some interesting temples. 
Gyeongju trip is worth it,"One hour bus drive from Busan Sasang bus terminal, then 50 minutes bus 10 or 11 to Bulguksa temple - 15 minutes walk to the temple. We needed 2 hours. A very old temple complex in the forests. Amazing."
Beautiful temple ,This beautiful temple is out of the main Gyeongju city. The main temple is surrounded by smaller buildings that can be accessed too & surrounded by gardens. Well worth a visit for the buildings architecture. 
Beautiful temple,"So huge, so beautiful, the temple, the statues, the park.. Everything was wonderful for people who like historic visit. Prefer visit early un the morning and so you can visit after the Gyeongju world parc who is a great amusement park not expendive and not far from the temple (same bus) "
Birthday trip ,"Of the three temples I visited during trip this was my favorite. I could almost feel the uniqueness, and solemn atmosphere they are trying to maintain. This visit was really eye opening for me. The hour we spent here was too short. We experienced the Buddha’s prayer period and even saw one walking across the grounds. Soo much rich history here. The grounds are well preserved. Great place to visit. Wished we could spend at least a weekend here. So serene. Hopefully I posted the right pics. "
The Most Beautiful Temple In South Korea,"One of the best things I have seen in South Korea, with no doubt!Bulguksa Temple (UNESCO World Heritage) is located on a mountain, not far from Gyeongju.There's a main temple and other pagodas and shrines.Colours,stunning architecture and history are only few of many other things you can find in this magnificent site!"
Beautiful Temple,Worth your time to see. Peace to walk around Beautiful grounds and worshiping areas. Don't miss if you are in Gyeongju
Sprawling Temple grounds,"As many sites in Gyeongju this temple is outside of town, but easily accessible by city bus. Set on a small incline the temple grounds have about 20 buildings with great views + architectural detail. When you exit, a cluster of restaurants starts across the street. Towards the right, a little 'Dog cafe', run by a young couple made the BEST COFFEE I had in Korea. (Not sure I find them here, so I let you know under the temple review)."
Huge temple ground ,A very big temple ground to explore. The surrounding park and lake is perfect for strolling and picture taking. The main temple ground is quite similar to most temple ground I have visited in China and elsewhere. Near by have lots of restaurants to try out delicious Korean food. 
Gorgeous temple,"One of the highlights of our visit to Gyeongju. This temple complex is quite big, so you'll need some time to discover every beautiful building. The surroundings are gorgeous and there is a huge car and bus park right next to the entry. Very convenient. If you're hungry: just cross the road, you'll find a lot of nice restaurants there."
lovely temple,"Beautiful temple complex. Try to be early in the morning, as it can be quite busy with visitors. Lots of parking though."
Easy to find,We took a bus here and walking around the park was lovely. There were a few really interesting large statues and religious shrines. It wasn't too crowded. It's a great place to get your steps in :)
Amazing,"Amazing and beautiful temple. Each temple was well maintained, and a few had people praying and meditating. Many folks made a point to bow and pay respects at each shrine. There were 4 or 5 different Buddhas each in their own shrine/temple. Each represented a different iteration of Buddha, and all were beautiful. Be careful with your photos, as the temple requests no pictures inside the individual shrines, although outside shots are ok. The walk from the parking lot isn't far, and is very nice. Beautiful representation of temples. A must see. There's a reason it's one of the most famous temples in Korea and a UNESCO site. Well worth going to."
Beautiful ,We took the number 11 bus to get here which seems to go quite regularly. It took about 35 minutes to get here and we got on the bus just across the road from Mc Donald's near enough to the Intercity bus terminal. You can also take the number 10 bus. The stop was announced in English. The site is beautiful and easy to wander around. The temple is big and in a lovely scenic location. We loved it. It was 5000won for entry which is about €4. 
Amazing experience!,"I have never been to a Buddhist temple, and this was an experience of a life time! The grounds and temple are meticulously cared for and pictures cannot not do justice to showing the detail. It was an honor to tour the grounds and to see the Monks doing their prayers and recitals. Only tip is to give a heads up on being respectful and remaining silent in most areas (in other words, this is NOT a playground for unsupervised children)."
Sense of peace,"The weather was really hot at about 31 degrees. However, when we arrived at the temple compound, it felt windy and peaceful. It’s nice to just walk around the compound and to various halls for praying. We easily spend slightly over 2 hours in the temple. You can take cab which costs about 18k won from bus terminal or bus no. 10 which cost about 1,700 won. As we were unsure of the route, we took a cab there and return by taking the bus."
Beautiful temple of world heritage site,Very old temple and listed as world heritage. A must to to if you visit Gyeongju. The complex is grand and located at a very good location. Easy to visit by bus. 
Phenomenal Temple,"The temple complex was another UNESCO world heritage site in Gyeongju and its setting, surrounded by forests in the mountains, gave this a very tranquil and beautiful setting for worshipping and visiting.The paths to all the sites were gravel and sand which made for an easy walk around the complex. The pathways were nicely landscaped with trees, ponds, and bridges giving us many photo opportunities.One of the first gates we passed through contained a number of colorful and fierce deities. A small museum on Bulguksa was located off the main path but we did not go in. The Jahamun Gate was part of the main wall enclosing the front of the temple complex and the most popular spot for photos. However, no one could actually enter through this gate and were directed off to the side entrances to gain entrance into the halls. We were able to get close to many of the halls and peek inside but as we were not active worshippers we stayed outside. Overall, lots of effort and attention to detail went into the reconstruction of many of these halls to replicate the original buildings lost during war.The most famous golden Sakyamuni Buddha was located in the Daeungjeon Hall. There were a few other statues located in different halls but this was the most accessible. As we walked further back into the complex, we climbed a steep set of stairs to view the Gwangneumjeong Hall which was the highest building overlooking the rest of the temple.If anyone feels adventurous then an hour plus walk to the Seokguram Grotto was possible from the temple."
Very special temple,"We would recommend visiting this Temple - it is one of the major tourist attractions, and deserved of its reputation."
Stunning,"Beautiful, tranquil place and setting. Take your time and stroll slowley taking in all the colors of the lanterns.Multiple buildings and shrines to visit. Our kids enjoyed exploring the stairs and different areas. Free spring water to refill your bottles, small gift stores. Decent price as you can spend hours here exploring. Beautiful photos to be taken except inside the temples where people are praying."
amazing temple complex,this is one of the best and amazing temples around Gyeongju. You can't go inside some of the buildings but just to appreciate the history and architecture
Authentic Palace,"As with all Asian palaces, they get kind of repetitive after the first few courtyards. The one thing that I thought was remarkable about this palace and made it stand out was the rock stacking courtyard. Make sure you find it and see it! It is a big garden full of hundreds of piles of nicely stacked rocks. People will stack rocks as a ""prayer"" that they hope will come true as their rocks stay high and balanced. This is a great place to visit if you're in Gyeongju area, but I wouldn't travel too far to visit this."
Rain,Take express-bus line 700 from Singyeongju ktx-station ;stops in front of temple-complex.Beautiful complex in good condition.Opposite the complex are restaurants.
Good view,Nice old place. Korea authentic. Must go for foreign. Nice place for good photo too. Luckily the weather is with ua that day. Nice
Beautiful temple,"From the temples I visited in Korea, this was my favourite. It looks beautiful, and has a nice garden. It was crowded with tourists and also lots of children on school trips."
Beautyful,"Nice place to visit. Very well kept, lot to see. Also nice walk in the park. We were there on “childrens day” so very busy."
A historic worth place on Unified Silla left,"Aside Angkor Wat, this place is serenely catching my eyes with peaceful view. It is not a big place to roam around but the architectures, its carving and its artifacts are the treasures to view and to appreciate. I strongly recommend visitors to visit this place if you plan to travel to Gyeongju and before you start to enter the temple, do visit the Bulguksa Temple Musuem first for the treasures and some background introductions before proceeding the temple for viewing, especially the pagodas. I personally felt that the visit in autumn season would be best, as it shows the most beauty sight of the temple and its surroundings. I would definitely come again to have the autumn sight."
Bulguksa temple + Seokguram Grotto + Golgulsa Temple,"Pretty avarage temple as many others in korea, pretty big (entrance fee about 5 dollars, free at budha's birthday), but if you are already at that temple, absolutely recommend walking to Seokguram Grotto (about 50 minutes walk a bit of uphill and another entrance fee 5 dollars). There is only a big stone statue in artificial cave behind the class, but it is amazing. Totally different as other temples in korea, and you can ask for english guide that will tell you a lot interesting stuff about it. And another temple nearby is Golgulsa Temple (this temple is for free) specializing in martial arts and there you can see martial arts performance every day at 15:00 (expect on mondays)"
UNESCO site and worth seeing at least once,I’m not a Buddhist but reading about the history and when it was built was really amazing. I went there with my Buddhist friend and she went inside the halls to pray. I stayed outside to look around and appreciate the architecture and history. 
A walk back in time,"Extremely popular, especially for school groups. Don't let that deter you. What you get to visit is but a small part of the complex. The restoration has been superb. The new indoor museum, great on a cold day, has wonderful pieces from the history of the ancient complex, worth the small entry fee."
Nice walk to the history,"We enjoyed this walk around very much. We felt it is a sacred place. It was a really nice journey to the past. We were also surprised by the number of visitors. Take your time to enjoy it, as there are not too many similar places in Korea."
Buddah beath,"One of the oldest temple in Korea. If you will read the story and the timing of build- you can't compare it to anything in Europe. So noce and colourful.of course so many tourists are walking there, but after the season of the vacation is not bad. Good place to take a spring photos and slow down for a moment. "
Centuries of history and culture,"Bulguksa Temple is on the western slope of Mt Tohamsan and what you see today is only a small part of the entire site. The Temple has been restored but the site was originally much much bigger, but what is there today is certainly impressive. Well worth its title of a World Heritage Site that represents the amazing skills of the Silla architects and how important the Buddhist faith was then. The pagodas, bridges and gardens and simple beautiful. Well worth a visit but there are a lot of steps and some can be a little steep."
Beautiful,Spent a few hours here in this well maintained Temple and it's surroundings. Should be incorporated with visiting Seokguram.
Interesting temple as part of an excursion,"We took a taxi to the Seokguram grotto, then walked the path downhill to the Bulguksa Temple. The path is extremely well constructed and easy to find, but in the steeper downhill section at the beginning, there's some loose gravel that can be slippery, so be cautious. The trail flattens out in the second half as you get closer to Bulguksa. There's a new visitors center in Bulguksa, which provides a nice overview. We did not have a guide, and so in hindsight, I think we missed a lot of interpretation about why this temple matters. But overall, it was a lovely and interesting excursion."
love that place," I really like that place, about ancient history.. the guide is the best and very friendly. i really liked that place and reccomend to anyone "
Need to walk bit to get there,"Nice easy walk to the Bulguksa temple. it was bit cold when I got there, but it was totally worth the effort. Luckily when I went there it wasnt too crowded... "
Nice temple in beautiful location,"I came here on an all-day bus tour from the information centre at the Gyeongju bus station. I have seen Buddhist temples in many countries, but was a bit disappointed with this one considering that it’s a UNESCO World Heritage site and is rated the best in Korea."
Historical Buddhist temple ,"If you combine with Cherry blossom in early April it will be a beautiful tour around Gyeongju. If you are interested in Buddhist temples in Korea, this will be one of must see. Entrance costs 5000 Korean Won. "
Very nice,"Beautiful temple. The area surrounding it is also beautiful. We went on a sunny day and really enjoyed our visit. Cost wise, it is a bit pricey, but still interesting."
Stunning architecture ,„World of Buddha Temple“ with extraordinary Silla architecture particularly the paintings on the roofs were breathtaking.
You can miss it,"If this was the only reason I came here from Busan, it would be a wasted trip. It's a pleasant temple with rich history, but so are hundreds of other temples in South Korea. If you are coming from Busan, you can take an express train to Singyeongju Station and then the 700 bus that will bring you directly to the temple. The bus also passes the Bird Park, so you may want to drop in there."
Wonderful to visit but...,"It's definitely worth a visit. A very large and expansive temple complex; comparable to Gyeongbukgong in Seoul. Gyeongju is the place to visit for history of the Silla dynasty. On the downside, it gets very crowded, there are lots of restrictions on photography and its 5000 won to get in plus an extra 5000 for the Seokguram grotto. Definitely a cash cow."
A great place to visit in Gyeongju,"Religious sacred place is always in my list of places to visit. There’s different buddha statue that explain their different purpose. I love the bright colours of the hanging paper lanterns. There’s also an area where you could build mini pagoda using stones, which i find it cute. I built mine, and you can get creative and have fun building yours too!"
Historical,"Me & my friends enjoyed here. The venue is pretty spacious, ancient and beautiful. They keep the place well maintained for an old temple."
Superb!,"We arrived at the Bulguksa Temple complex after a half-hour drive from Gyeongju. It was late in the afternoon on a foggy day with a heavy rain, which probably contributed to a quiet and enjoyable visit. The temple complex is exceptional in its significance for the Korean Buddhism and its artistry. The location and the surroundings are simply magnificent! We started by visiting the museum at the entrance, then spent about 3 hours slowly walking around and admiring all the beautiful architecture, decorations, statues, and the landscape. We had a wonderful guide, very knowledgeable and patients, eager to answer our questions. If you have time, try to discover the playful ceiling wooden sculptures spread across the temple buildings - the Good-luck Pig being probably the most famous of them! The short hike to the Seokguram Grotto was invigorating and totally worth the effort! The Buddha sculpture in the Grotto is incredibly beautiful in its serenity and the whole architectural complex inside the Grotto incredibly beautiful! Definitely recommended, a must-see UNESCO World Heritage place!"
Ancient and magnificent ,Lovely attraction. The autumn leaves were at peak and plenty of photo opportunities for fall sceneries. The gardens were well kept and the array of stones stacked in balanced was awesome. Enjoyed the walk at this well conserved site. 
Try to come at a quiet time,"I was really excited to see this place, as I have seen tons of beautiful temples and have heard great things about this one. However, coming around 11am on a Sunday morning made this should-be peaceful place a nightmare. It was completely packed with pushy people and running and screaming unsupervised children. The buildings as part of this temple seem quite lovely but we got very little time to take them in and enjoy them because we were constantly dodging children or old mannerless people. The museum had some good information, but again we were aggressively shoved by two old men on two separate occasions so we couldn't wait to get out. The souvenir shops are also full of overpriced items that I know from experience I can get for cheaper in Seoul. You can also see other old, beautiful temples throughout Korea with significantly less people, such as in Busan and Eumseong. It was a real shame as this seems like it should be a good place worth the 5 dollar per person ticket, but it ended up being one of the worst tourist destinations we have had the experience with - and we've traveled a lot. Huge disappointment. Try to plan to come at a quieter time."
Beautiful temple to visit,"Another Silla era treasure. Pagodas, a lake, bridges, beautiful gardens. A very wealthy temple and the largest in South Korea. Well worth a visit but the souvenir shop didn’t impress. Loved the colourful lanterns though"
Nice temple visit,"The visit to Bulguksa temple was worthy despite it's entrance fee of 5,000 won being higher than most places in Korea. You can visit several pavilions and see the beautiful wood carvings. There are also 2 korean-style stone pagodas.It's recommend to do this visit together with Seokguram grotto as it is only a 2.2km hike away (uphill if starting from Bulguksa) or connected by Bus 12. Getting to Bulguksa from central Gyeongju was quite fast with Buses 10 or 11."
A must see,"Due to jet lag we arrived there only around 11 a.m. and very afraid that it was crowded.However,despite several busses of visitors rather quiet and civilzed.Wonderful experience,well worth the 5 USD entrance fee.Highly recommended."
Wonderful in Autumn,"We were lucky enough to visit Bulguksa in Autumn when the leaves were changing colours and it was just wonderful. One of the most beautiful places we went in Korea, just as lovely as the secret garden at Changdeokgung. I recommend visiting earlier in the day than we did - we got there at about 10:30 or 11am and it was already quiet crowded. I bet it would have been much quieter if we went before 9am! We caught the bus from the city centre and it took us longer than we thought to find the bus stop, wait for the bus and ride the bus to Bulguksa, so do leave plenty of time for that. I wish we had put the effort in to get up early!"
Stunning autumn colours,"Visited the temple in early Nov. and it was really beautiful in autumn. A unique temple with two stone staircases at the front. There was a lake surrounded by colourful autumn trees. Although there were many tourists, the place was not crowded because of the large gardens and courtyards."
My second time to visit,My family went to Gyeongju second time while visit we always visit Bulguksa Temple It's very famous temple in Korea. I like this place
A nice morning walk !,"5000 per adults to enter. About 1h to 2h walk in a very calm and nice environment. Temple is really well maintained and is definitely worth looking at.Opens at 7am, which is convenient to avoid all the tour buses."
Very popular and crowded UNESCO Heritage site,"One of the must visit UNESCO sites when in Gyeongju. It was quite crowded when we went as there were lots of tourist groups and domestic student groups. The temple is quite large with many stairs and buildings, so take your time to wander around. Best to visit the temple in the early morning as this is the place that's furthest from town and not close to other attractions. Take bus 10, 11 and 700."
Must visit place UNESCO Heritage site,This temple is a must visit place if you are in Gyeongju. It is a UNESCO Heritage site. The temple is very old and has been rebuilt many times. The architecture and the natural beauty is really worth the visit.
Worth the visit ,Came here at 1725. 5min till their entrance close. The staff told me that theres no exit time limit. Im surprised. Its a really well maintained temple. A pray inside to wish for luck. 
"A Uniquely Beautiful Amalgam of Architecture, Art, Culture and History","More like an outdoor museum, the Bulguksa Temple offers a singularly beautiful display of architecture, art and history. It is well worth your time. Read on for details.Surrounded by beautiful landscape and, when we were there, trees changing colors, the landscape around the temple is serene and restful. Well the temple shears features with so many others in this country, the size, preservation and details set it apart. We have been to our share of temples throughout Southeast Asia and the Himalayas but the Bulguksa Temple stood out for its beauty and vastness"
Overnight Temple Stay at Bulguksa,"We stayed at Bulguksa overnight in August. Our guide was Jodie she was fantastic, very knowledgeable and willing to help. On arrival we were taken to the accommodation which was a very new Hanok, sleeping on the traditional mats, there were plenty of them, so was reasonably comfortable. It had an ensuite bathroom and air conditioning. The food was plain and simple but you could eat as much as you wanted - if you put it on your plate you must eat it. Being in and around the Temple once the other tourists had gone was so peaceful. We opted to make the Lotus flowers instead of the 108 prostrations. The early morning ceremony with the monks was an incredible experience and the tea ceremony was brilliant the monk had a real sense of humour. Overall a must do if you are in south, South Korea."
Very impressive experience (temple stay),Our temple stay was a very impressive experience! Our host did explain everything from the history of the temple to ceremonies held in it. Included in the stay is a very intense drum and mediation ceremony after sunset. Also you’ll sleep an a Hanok on thin mat on a heated floor. Very rudimentary but thats part of the experience! There is also a dinner and breakfast with the monks of the monastery. Do it!
Historical and spiritual place,A visit to Gyeongju with its plentitude of historical places isn’t complete without a visit to this temple. Take a bus or drive your car and enjoy the sights and sounds of this charasteristic Buddhist temple. 
Great cultural experience,"Cheapest way to get there from Gyeongju is by bus, numbers,10,11 and 700 all do the job. On the number 10 its the stop after the Kolon hotel and golf course. But the stops are easily recognised, being written on the stop roof. Bus stops by tourist information centre, walk past this through the car park and up through the park towards the right and you will see the main entrance. Admission 5000 each.Temple is impressive and was busy on our visit. There are steps but its worth the effort.To eat here ( whilst we waited for the shuttle bus) come out of the temple back down the hill to the tourist information centre, there is a big complex on the other side of the road. We are at Rans Kitchen and had an excellent lunch. Its located on the far left , as you look from the tourist info. Centre."
Colourful lantern ,"Big temple and leisurely stroll inside would give you peaceful mind. It's so peaceful and quiet during my visit, no group no children. Also many colourful lantern around. Good for picturesque. I use bus 10 opposite train terminal, first bus stop near the bank. According to the KakaoMap, bus 10, 11 and 700 can be taken from this bus stop. If unsure can always check with information counter or at the bus stop. Bus stop will appear bus number with arrival time. You also can go Seokguram Grotto if you have extra time, if not just forget this temple. you can choose to hike up from the ticket counter or shuttle bus no.12. Hiking up take around 1 hour for 2km and from entrance of Seokguram another 1.4km, total walk 3.6km, as per sign. If you're hiking up, you'll be greet with lots of stairs, spring water, crazy view, insects, maple tree, mud path. While taking bus must be well aware of the timing as it run hourly and the journey takes 40mins at 1,700won per person. So choose wisely and plan well. Personal advise, better go up by bus and hike down. It's faster hiking down and up. "
Wonderful historic ensemble,It is a must to see that temple - a masterpiece of buddhist art.UNESCO world heritage.Not far away the unique Seokguram cave from the 8th century
Lots of steps,Very Interesting temple. There are lots of steps but the view is worth it. The steps are also very steep. Well worth the visit 
Not as gorgeous as those in Southeast Asia,"Although the temple is beautiful and well preserved, it is not comparable to the budhist complexes in southeast asia. Worth a quick visit."
"Huge temple, but not unlike other Asian Temples","A huge-ish historical complex that is rebuilt after the Japanese burned it down. Very similar to other historical Buddhist Asian temples. Highly encourage you to visit this place if you have not experienced Asian temples before. The entire area is calming and serene.Am particularly amazed by a section in the temple where they stacked rocks on top of each other to resemble pagodas. It's like a mini city itself.You can take Bus 12 from the main road below the temple to go to Seokguram Grotto. Bus 12 departs every hourly when we were there. There are also numerous eateries at the main road leading up to the temple. You can get here via Bus 10, 11 and 700.A must visit in Gyeongju due to its UNESCO status. For the religious, you can also pray to the deities here. If you're interested, you can also sign up to spend the night in the temple for a small fee. There's a counter in front of the temple for you to ask or you can Google for more info regarding the temple stay."
Beautiful example of Silla Architecture,Our visit was part of a cruise ship tour. It's a beautiful temple perched on the slopes of Mt. Tohamsan. It's a very restful serene place and well worth a visit.
This was an amazing experience!,This was an amazing experience! We were able to have tea with the high priest and ring the reunification bell. 
Large Temple Complex in Scenic Surroundings,"To get to the Bulguksa Temple complex from the parking lot, you walk through a serene park-like environment. You pass through a couple of gates and by the Pond of Banya before reaching the temple complex. You’ll need to walk up a number of steps to go into the temple complex. There are two stone pagodas and several buildings containing Buddha statues."
a very classic historic site,"A must go if you visit Gueongju. A very traditional temple area with many local families enjoying themselves, but still not crowded. Would be good if you have some guidebooks / a tour guide, to understand more clearly about the history."
"Beautiful grounds, breathtaking temple","Lots of ground to cover here. Wear comfortable shoes. Temple grounds are very well maintained. Landscaping compliments temple. I would highly recommend visiting. Great for all travelers. Some temples require a hike or up mts but these grounds are flat, easy walking but beautiful."
Highlight of Gyeongju visit,"Rather extensive grounds with a number of beautiful statues scattered throughout the complex. One of the best temples we’ve seen in Korea, well worth the trek. The temple opens at 7am and it is best to go early before the tour groups swarm the place. You can catch the # 10 or 11 from Gyeongju, takes up to 50 mins but first thing in the morning we got there in about 30 mins. "
Day trip to the Bulguksa temple,"Enjoyed the walk to the temple, looking at the stone structures. A must visit if you are at Gyeongju and into history. However, need to take note of the transport. The place is quite far in and the buses will only come at about every hour interval. There is a sign board at the entrance of the temple so you need to check it out and time yourself if you don't want to miss the bus. A must visit to Seokguram grotto if you are there. It is a just nearby, about five minute ride."
One-day trip from Busan,We took intercity bus from Nopo subway st. (line 1) to Geyongju and then changed to the local bus no 11 to Bulguksa(10 also goes to the temple). You can also take intercity bus to Geyongju from Sasang subway st. (line 2) but I m not sure how frequent the buses are from there. It took us about 3 hours to get to the temple from Haeundae subway station.
Nice historical temple; but overcrowded and gaudy lanterns,"It was hard to enjoy a temple when it was overcrowded, and on weekends yes popular temples with UNESCO World Heritage credentials will get crowded. But I found the gaudy lanterns (well they are not peculiar to this temple to be fair) not to my taste really. Hard to dispute the beauty of the temple themselves or their historical and cultural significance, but also hard to really enjoy the visit."
UNESCO World Heritage Site. History and stunning scenery.,"A representative temple of the Silla period. You can see stone buildings of the Shilla period with a wonderful curve. If you visit Gyeongju and do not see Bulguksa temple, it is like you have not visited Gyeongju. When you visit Bulguksa, I recommend you to see Seokguram Buddha statue nearby."
A holiday highlight,"It`s one and a half hour drive from Busan. We visited this beautiful temple with a lovely knowledgeable guide. Unusual weather conditions made this a holiday highlight. Yesterday it had snowed but today it was sunny. The colours of the woodwork of the temple against the blue sky and white snow was stunning and the just opened cherry blossom added to the picture. We were early and it was not too busy. Our guide told us the history and brought the site to life as we walked along. There were rows of red lanterns for Buddhas birthday with many messages, which was very special. Good gift shop."
The most beautifull temple of Korea ,"This Is the most beautifull temple of Korea. In a nice area jou can have a walk around the buildings. I found the lanterns a pitty. We were here 10 years ago, and without lanterns the view was beyter"
"Very Important Site, But Busy","Obviously this is one of the most important temples in Korea, so you ought to see it. Just note that it is often really crowded. Moreover, it is often really crowded with high school and university students screaming at the top of their lungs. Not the best atmosphere for a temple. You might want to check your Google Maps application to see when it is least crowded and plan your visit accordingly. Tip: if you want to save time getting to Seokguram Grotto you can skip the bus and hunt around for someone to share a taxi with in the temple parking lot. Expect to pay about 10 000 won or so in total."
The highlights are the cherry blossoms on top of the UNESCO temple,We were fascinated by the cherry blossoms upon arrival at the site. Numerous tourists surrounded the cherry trees shooting photos. The blossoms are of pink colour and petals are multiple which make them look better than anywhere else in Korea. The temple itself is huge but worth walking around at leisure.
Beautiful but busy,"We first tried to visit on Saturday at around 11am, but the traffic was queuing back out of the car park. A lot were there for the cherry blossom park not the templeWe went back at 8.30am the following day and things were much less hectic, though there were already lots of people in the parkThe temple is wonderful, built on lots of levels around several courtyards it is definitely worthy of its World Heritage status "
Nice walk but extremely crowded with tourists ,This place is easily more crowded than Gyeongbukgung in Seoul. But it is a beautiful walk and most explanations along the way are in several languages. 
Beautiful temple,Since we walked into the temple. Beside us was Sakura. A lot of Sakura!! Very beautiful. In the temple. there's pond..very nice. And the temple is very beautiful. The lamps were pretty. But we had to wait for a long time for bus to go back to the city.
"To appreciate the temple, visit with a local friend","This beautiful temple harbors many national treasures. To truly appreciate it, visit the temple with a local friend (I guess a local tour guide would also do the trick). And don't forget to walk up the mountain to the Buddha cave."
Photography + Spirituality,"Set on spacious grounds, this temple complex is a joy to visit, no matter whether you're religious or not at all inclined.From the serene surrounding garden grounds to the ornate carvings on the buildings, there's no shortage of things to see and marvel.It's a fantastic location if you enjoy photography as there's no shortage of photo opportunities throughout.An absolute must visit destination!"
"Respectful, Beautiful, Functioning Temple","Absolutely worth the bus ride and hike. Know that this is a functioning Temple, so be respectful. There are limits on pictures inside, but there are plenty of lovely sights to enjoy. Give yourself plenty of time to walk around and know the timing of the buses. Good recommendation - if you want to go up to the Grotto, know when the bus is going up, so you can time your visits. We loved taking the bus up and walking down from the Grotto, through the National Park, back to the Temple."
Nice and loved it!,"It was so nice to walked in the temple inside and outside of the place,though its a long walk from the bus stop up to the temple.We ride the bus no. 700 in going to Bulguksa temple back and forth to Singgyeongju station before heading to Busan."
Beautiful and special,Well preserved Buddhist temple well kept by nuns. Unique Buddha statues amazing garden. We came while cherry trees were blossoming so the gardens around the temple were all white. it was one of the most amazing nature scenes we have ever seen. in 
Beautiful scenic temple compound,A few temples there and beautiful scenery. Legend says there is a wild boar staying at the temple and touching the golden wild boar will bring luck to yourself
Beautiful Temple,"This temple is so well preserved and enjoyable to walk around.The skills of the craftsmen that built this, is simply amazing."
Beauty of Silla ,"It was truly amazing! So epic!! I loved being there i cant explain its beauties... just moved by its philosophy and the way of expression.. this place has many hidden stories and legends ..please study little bit before you visit this gorgeous temple. You will feel it in a totally different way. I fell in love with ‘seok-ga tower’ Such an elegance , perfect simplicity and modernism in it... "
Enjoyable Buddhist Temple Experience,"The trip will take about 1 to 2 hours to complete. Parking was 1,000 won and entrance fee was 5,000 won per adult. The temple is very nice but needs to have some paint work done. Overall, a great experience and definitely worth the fee."
Very pretty temple,"This is a large and beautiful temple set against a backdrop of mountains and forest. It was pretty busy (I think due to a national holiday the day before, which I'm guessing led to long weekends) but not uncomfortably so. The grounds are reasonably large and it was nice for a gentle wander around. No photos are allowed of the interiors of the various prayer rooms.I caught the #10 bus from outside the express bus terminal and it took about 30 minutes at a cost of 1,700 won. I believe the #11 takes a similar time. Entrance fee was 5,000 won (reasonable). The walk up to Seokguram Grotto from Bulguksa is very nice although steep in parts - it took me just under an hour to the grotto itself. Better than waiting for another bus."
National Treasure in Korea,This is a national treasure in Korea and worth a visit. We went in wintertime and it was serene and peaceful. I'm sure it is much more hectic and touristy in the springtime so I was lucky to go when there were not many people. The grounds and the temple along with the water features and view over the mountains make a spectacular setting.
Korea’s Treasure. Gold. DIAMOND.,"A wonderful site to visit. What? Not into bhuddism? Doesn’t matter. I’m an aethiest and was absolutely blown when I saw the Vatican City. You will, too, after visiting here."
Wonderful temple,"It is a very beautiful temple and it is easy to reach with the bus. But for me, I found It a little too touristic."
2nd Time in Bulguksa,I told myself I would go back here. Last time it was spring so I said I should visit during autumn season. I specifically love the beauty of the pond beside the temple and the mixture of autumn colors. I took bus no. 11 from Gyeongju train station and got off at Bulguksa Temple. I think bus no. 11 has less stops hence faster. 
Belongs to top three temples in South Korea,"Bulguksa, Haeinsa and Gyeongbok Palace in Seoul are the top three temples in South Korea. Nice Location and special atmosphere..Watch the stone construction of the main wall which makes the temple more stable against earthquakes. Women in traditional dresses spent Lotus tee for free and even gave us the two white Lotus shaped bowls for free. Touch the bronze pig and you will get rich"
Calm n fresh air,"Good place to visit w/ family. Well paved area w/ fresh air.Takes 30 min. from Kyungju city center.Also close to the Gampo beach 30min distance from there. If you are not interested in the Buddist temple, the beach is also good option to you."
Gorgeous grounds and temple,"The grounds surrounding the temple, as well as the temple buildings themselves, were absolutely stunning with red leaves. Just near the bridges is a well spring where you can drink refreshing water from one of two streams. Inside the temple is very peaceful. My friend made the mistake of trying to take a picture while inside one of the buildings; I'm thankful that the worker who reminded us not to do so was so kind about it.Around (I believe) Nahanjeon is an area with many many piles of stacked rocks, which was really cool and made for some pretty pictures. Souvenirs at the shop are plentify and quite beautiful, but if you're wearing a backpack I would suggest asking if they can keep it at the counter to avoid knocking anything over. The workers there are /extremely/ helpful and very kind about it to boot, and honestly good for them, considering where the proceeds go."
Very beautiful,Very nice place. I would say one of the best ones we visited in Korea. Highly recommend. Make sure to wear comfortable shoes.
"Nice place to visit, especially in autumn","We took the #10 bus to the temple for around 30minutes from downtown. A bit of a walk from the bus stop, and you'll find the place. There's an entrance fee of 5000won each.We went when it was early, so there were not too many people, just a lot of student groups on a field trip. You can spend a most 2hours and you're done."
Beautiful temple and gardens,"Visited this place on a Sat early morning in late Oct. Less people and more peaceful. Leaves were still green and yellowish (tot they would had turn red). But temple and its surrounding areas are still beautiful.We took bus #11 but I did not check how much is the bus fare as we used t-money card. Covered the whole area in 2.5 hours as we stopped very frequently to snap pictures..:). There are 2 path to the temple. We took the one that lead to the gardens and pond first. There are some food and souvenir stalls along this path. Glad we visited this place early in the morning. When we left the place late morning, lots of cars and visitors arriving."
Lovely peaceful park and castle ,Went here in autumn- so beautiful to see the colour turning on the leaves. It was nice to walk around the old palace grounds. We purchased a bell from the lady selling souvenirs in the middle of the grounds - it was much cheaper than the same souvenir from the souvenir shop near the big bell. You can buy a wish or blessing that you hang from one of the many lanterns hanging in the area.A great visit. 
Beautiful temple close to the mountain to visit,Beautiful temple may not be the most spectacular of South Korea but it deserves to be visited. To get there you will need a car or take a bus because it is on foot from the mountain (30 minutes drive).
Magnificent Unesco Heritage Site,"A visit to Bulguksa Temple is a must for lovers of history or architecture. It is the crown jewel of the Shilla Kingdom's architecture and yes, is on Unesco's World Cultural Heritage List. The building is gorgeous, the setting, lovely and the artistry, magnificent. I left with admiration for the carpenters and the painters of the Shilla Kingdom. Highly recommended."
Attractive temple,"It is a great blend of tourist attraction and an authentic temple experience. Saw some of the monks actually conducting some prayers, and a lot of people (mostly locals) did a bit of praying on each of the altar. A bit of a hike, but not terrible. Go here in the morning, I feel it's more serene that way."
Interesting place to go. ,"We took the bus here. It's easy to find as it's the last stop. The entry fee is 5,000 krw. We really enjoyed the free English tour. The guide was very informative. She explained many things about Buddism and the different Buddha's in the complex."
"A famous, need to see, temple","We had an English speaking guide provided free by the ticket/information office. The guide gave us a much better understanding of the temple layout, buildings, and operation than if we had walked around on our own. This is a famous temple in Korea and should be visited if possible. A lot of temples in Korea, including Bulguksa, have been partially (and in some more severe cases almost fully) rebuilt following destruction or damage by the Japanese over the centuries."
Fantastic temple,"Beautifully preserved temple, just outside Gyeongju's historic area, but nevertheless the main reason for most people to visit the city/area. Nice tranquil area with a series of gold Buddha's. Not something you want to miss when you're in the area, but try to avoid school classes of annoyed adolescents..."
Great visit,This temple (world heritage site) is around a 20 minute drive from the main city area but it is well worth it. At 5000 KRW it's a bit pricey (for gyeongju) but it is definitely worth the price. There is a lot of history steeped in this world heritage site and a lot of photo opportunities too. Great for the family too. Recommend it.
Korean Buddhist Temple,"This temple is okay and worth visiting. Notable are the gold Buddha's and Boddhisatvas, painted rafters, fish and drum in the courtyard of the main pavilion and of course the main stairways leading up and verandas sticking out. Don't forget to capture that vista on the way out as you might not notice it from the path in - the dramatic stone stairways are steep and closed to visitor foot traffic."
'Working' temple in beautiful setting.,"Kept in as original condition as possible, Bulguska is an active temple with prayers conducted regularly. Set in a tranquil setting, the surrounding gardens are well maintained and are worth wandering around after visiting the temple. But it is the temple complex itself which captures the eye. It is beautifully proportioned and balanced with its natural surrounds and is somewhat different in grandeur from similarly constructed temples. The trip out is also pleasant enough and you do get to see a variety of amusement and themed parks, large resorts and and hotel complexes that seem to exist separately from the main town of Gyeongju."
Great place,A big temple kept in original form. Very nice and well maintained. I adore the architecture and colors. It is a great place to see and well worth it.
Been Here Twice & Still Love It!,"The first time I visited Bulguksa was when I was a teenager. And so when I came back as an adult, it was just as mesmerizing and beautiful as I had remembered it. This temple was a favorite of mine in my youth so it was a great feeling to come back and witness just how great I had remembered it to be. Bulguksa is large in location, so make sure to having your comfortable sneakers on before visiting. There's a lot of walking involved. There is absolutely so much to see and tour inside. This whole temple is filled with Korea's National Treasures and you shouldn't want to miss any of that. Whether it's the pagodas, the ancient but vastly colorful decor, or the amazing architecture of historical Korea, Bulguksa is a sight you don't want to ever miss. Enjoy!"
Beautiful woodwork,We were moved by the fantastic wood works and the temples below.There isn't much walking so a good thing to do after two days trekking.We recommend to visit it.
THIS IS THE ESSENCE OF KOREAN ARCHITECTURE AND BEAUTY,"This is an absolute place you must visit in this beautiful historical city, Gyeongju. I fell in love with this city. Most of all, this temple is an unbelievable combinations of cutting edge science, geometry, architecture and art of that time. They provide every hour expert guides' free explanation.Make sure you make use of it. While I was listening them, I was astonished by people of that time and heritages they achieved. You can't help but to love this place more. "
One of my Favorites,"There's a lot of temples in this part of the world, but Bulguksa will always be one of my favorites. It feels like a palace and the craftsmanship is fantastic. Great wood work, great stone work and great paintings. Try not to get overwhelmed by the crowds and take the time to look at some of the details of the construction. Some of the best parts are the subtle ones like the details in the roofing and contrast between the straight edged stone slabs and the boulders. The location is also stunning and you should take a little time to enjoy the mountains."
True essence!,"If you think no more tombs, no more temples, you should go Bulguksa, it's a must thing. Look at the side of 10 eon coin. You can see a real pagoda here. Beautiful architecture which stands here for hundreds thousands of year. Summer in here is hot and humid as it's in the middle of Toham mountain. But you won't regret to come here. (I know jogyesa in Seoul is also beautiful but Bulguksa is more like a historical art.)"
Peace in the atmosphere ,"A must visit for this region , a world heritage site , extremely well preserved , be ready for a good walk if u want to explore it for the fullest "
Must see ,You must see this beautiful place when you are in Gyeongju. Lots of things to see and great place to just walk around. The way the temple is built and surrounding grounds are spectacular!
Beautiful temple complex,Very interesting historic temple complex in Gyeongju. We came here on a tour and found it very worthwhile . I particularly liked the male and female pagodas. They look quite small when you are on their level but as you progress up the levels you get a different perspective and realise how large they are! Six temples are on the site and all different and interesting in their own right. Recommended !
A definite must go when visiting gyeongju,Location is a little far out from the main town but very accessible via their public bus. The temple in overall makes people feel really at peace when visiting as they housed various Buddhas. Would definitely recommend people to visit as it showcases a scenic and interesting overview of the Korea culture comparatively to those palaces seen in Seoul.
Serene and relaxing UNESCO World Heritage site of Bulguksa temple!,"Bulguksa temple is a must-see in Gyeongju. We took a bus from Gyeongju bus station and it was a long ride, but we were discussing our excursions and experiences with fellow passengers in the bus, so the ride didn't feel long at all. The temple is beautiful and is generally busy. Despite there being moderate crowd on the day of our visit, it was not at all chaotic. The temple is nestled in a very beautiful, green habitat; there's also a lake closeby. I was fascinated by the prayer candles that were placed in the ceiling throughout the temple perimeter."
"Easy day trip from Haeundae, Busan","A relatively compact temple complex set in the hills. All though most of it was rebuilt or restored it is still a beautiful working temple. We were staying in Haeundae, Busan and did a day trip to the temple and Gyeongju. We were able to catch a regional train from Shin-haeundae station to Bulguksa (1hr 20min ₩5,000). Once in Bulguksa town there is plenty of taxis and bus stops. A taxi to the main entrance is ₩5,000 or its about a 4km walk uphill. If you take the south entrance on the way out, and walk back up to the shops near the temple there is a tourist information centre. They gave us maps of Gyeongju and also bus information. Buses into Gyeongju run every 15 -20 mins. We got bus 10, which did seem to stop at a few small towns along the way and took about 30 mins and tickets were ₩1,700."
Relax trip,"Took bus near sugar hotel, can ask the front desk how to take the bus, stop the roadside just walk follow by signboard, big areas with lots of trees "
Heavenly.. Stunning..!!,The temple is well maintained despite of being hundreds of years old. The surrounding sceneries are awesome. Describing heaven on earth. You should drink the natural spring water which you'll find on your way to that temple. I will always want to go there again..!!
Best Temple in Korea,"Strongly recommend! Alone, with friends, with family.. this place would be one of the perfect attractions during your stay in Korea. Actually the city itself where the temple is located is a historic and memorable place. If you travel or stay in Korea for a while, visit here!"
Highlight of Gyeongju ,"How to get to Belguksa temple Gyeongju.Take buses 10, 11 from outside the tourist office close to the bus station or as they pass through centre of town for ~30 minute trip to the drop off.Wonderfully restored colourful grand temple with many parts to wander through. Information boards add to your enjoyment and appreciation.Thanks for the vote if you found this review helpful."
Beautiful temple ,It's a very beautiful place to see. We get there in the morning but there were already many tourists. It easy to get there you can take the bus number 11 and it's not really far away.I think the price is a little bit expensive but again it's a tourist attraction. The monk were praying at the time we visited so it was really nice.
International Tournament for Martial Arts. The tournament will be next week and there will be 36 countries.,"Good, the place was clean, peaceful and not very strict with the tourist. It was hot when we visited the temple but the breeze made it relaxing and comfortable."
Incredibly Beautiful Ancient Temple Complex,The temple is a long bus ride from the Singyeongjyu train station. It is probably closer to the Gyeonjyu train station but we did not have a choice. It is a huge complex & there is a lot of climbing up & down of stairs. This is tough if you are tired and if the day is hot. I recommend getting there as early in the day as you can when you are feeling well-rested. It is definitely worth visiting/
Beautiful Temple,"In 1955 this was dedicated a UNESCO WORLD HERITAGE Site, so you know that it is worth spending time here, which we did. Built in the 8th century, partially destroyed in the16th century by invading Japanese during a battle, it was reconstructed faithfully in 1970. It is considered a masterpiece of Buddhist architecture. This is very impressive!"
Its huge,"This is an amazing complex.. It was all tarted up with hanging coloured lanterns to celebrate a special occasion apparently.There were temples everywhere, monks and nuns walking and praying and chanting.The gardens were kept immaculately by people sweeping paths with straw brooms. Also there were little squirrels? running all through the stone blocks of the temples..Such a great place.."
My favorite temple visited in South Korea ,This temple is a thing of beauty! There are multiple buildings open with active praying going on inside. There are some very steep and uneven steps throughout the area so it may not be very accessible for people with mobility issues. Put this on your bucket list for South Korea.
"Not a mosque, interesting but not worth the trouble ","The bulguksa temple is located 10 miles outside of central Gyeongju. It's a nice temple but as far as temples go it isn't that special when you consider the time the trip takes (40 min, depending on the location of your hotel). Of course if you haven't seen many temples this one has the wow factor but there are many simular temples in Korea (2 in Seoul for instance). So if you don't have the time don't feel to sad about missing it. The two pagodas that are world heritage can also be seen at the museum of Gyeongju (replicas) and admission to the museum unlike the temple is free. And if you go for the Buddha in the grotto, there is a replica there too as that particular attraction is totally overrated. "
Masterpiece of the Silla kingdom,"Bulguksa is considered as a masterpiece of the golden age of Buddhist art in the Silla kingdom( King Beopheung in 528). This temple encompasses seven National treasures of South Korea, including the Dabotap and Seokgatap stone pagodas and two gilt-bronze statues of Buddha. The temple is classified as Historic and Scenic Site No. 1 by the South Korean government. In 1995, Bulguksa was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List together with the Seokguram Grotto, which lies four kilometers to the east."
Average Sightseeing,"It took about 30min from Singyeongju Station (KTX). After exiting station, turn right and head for bus stop. (There is another bus stop for tour bus.) Take bus #700. For weekdays, the bus does not ends here. Tell the driver ""temple"" if you not sure where to alight. The temple is up-slope when you alight."
Beautiful and Serene Buddhist Temple,"A large complex of temple buildings, bell, and courtyard. Several buildings with Buddhas. Very old stone pagodas. It is nice to walk around here to enjoy the trees and architecture. When I was here, there was an exhibit of paintings done by students - fun. "
A must,A must visit as it is a very very iteresting temple in which you can spend enough time. It is worth the drive out. 
Large temple,The temple is located in large park. This is very relaxing area. We also ordered tea- jujube. It is awful. We didn't like it at all. The temple is beautiful.
Inexpensive and picturesque ,"Although many temples in Korea have a similar feel, Bulguksa still has a lot of charm. It's inexpensive for all you can experience here. It has many places you can take a picture at. You can take a picture from various angles of the lake: on the bridge, below it and across the lake, or long distance shots of the bridge. Then you walk to the temple and see how old the staircases are, continue up the hill, and take pictures of the two pagodas just outside the temple. You can view one temple there, take a picture of the wooden doors, and continue to the other temple. If you go in May, you can see colorful lanterns celebrating Buddha's birthday. Finally, you can see a rock garden where Buddhists make their wishes."
Beautiful temple and park,"We drove 2.5 hours to visit this, I was well worth it. I strongly suggest visiting the temple and surrounding Parks. Taking an English tour with the temple is recommended. "
Awe Inspiring,"If you have an interest in the origins of Buddhism in Korea then this will both humble you and make your day. This site is very impressive and each of the temples is magnificent with their gold Buddha icons and tankas, not to mention the ornate and detailed painted interiors and exteriors. The grounds are impeccably kept and overall this was a truly worthwhile excursion."
A well laid out Buddhist temple,"There is a lot to see at Bulguksa, and the price is only ￦5000. Many of the shrines have large Buddhist statues and the buildings themselves are fascinating."
An enjoyable World Heritage Site,It was rather busy during the week celebrating Buddha's birthday. Much of the complex has been repainted. Most people go on to visit the Seokguram Grotto but the view of the stone Buddha is restricted and no photography is allowed.
Good place,"Bulguksa is located on the slopes of mount Toham (Jinheon-dong, Gyeongju city, North Gyeongsang province, South Korea). It is a head temple of the Jogye Order of Korean Buddhism and encompasses seven National treasures of South Korea, including the Dabotap and Seokgatap stone pagodas, Cheongun-gyo (Blue Cloud Bridge), and two gilt-bronze statues of Buddha. The temple is classified as Historic and Scenic Site No. 1 by the South Korean government.[1] In 1995, Bulguksa was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List together with the Seokguram Grotto, which lies four kilometers to the east."
Bulguksa temple visit after work,"One of UNSECOs safeguarded sites,Pretty colorful as a place with quite a bit of history. One can see the Buddhist worshipping as well within the temple.Quite a few good pictures can be captured within the area."
UNESCO Preserved Site,"Built in the year 528, the name of the temple is literally translated as ""Temple of Buddha's Land"". It aims to realize the blissfulness of the Buddhist scriptures where the mortal being's suffering is being released."
Beautiful temple in a beautiful area,"Very nice to walk around and quite beautiful temple to see. It is quite a pity that there were lots of refurbishments when we went to visit, but on the other hand, at least the place is being taken care of. And that's quite important!We possibly spent over an hour and a half enjoying the views and the setting. Very nice place to see on a sunny day !!"
A beautiful temple in a beautiful setting,"We were here in the late afternoon in spring and it was beautiful. It is very well maintained, the paths are good and the signage excellent. The gardens are beautiful and in the late afternoon the atmosphere was incredibly tranquil. well worth a visit."
Beautiful temple and grounds,"This is a really stunning temple complex, set in beautiful grounds. I was lucky to go during cherry blossom season and there is a park full of cherry trees which looked amazing. It is a working temple and there were prayers/ceremonies occurring throughout the day which you could observe or take part in."
Recommended temple tour and shopping,"Temple was cultural highlight of our tour day along with Gyeongju National Museum. The entry features four wooden statues. Inside, the souvenir kiosk was very popular and open to discount bulk buying .. we bought a golden dragon. Lots of good photo opportunities. The cherry blossoms were in bloom .. best views were to the left of the entry."
Very well-preserved temple especially in April,"The Bulguksa Temple in Gyeongju is a great place to stop by if driving along the east coast of S. Korea or as a half-day trip from Busan (about 1.5 hours' drive North). Ample parking, good signage in English and beautifully decorated with colourful lanterns in April and May for Buddha's birthday."
Best attraction in Gyeongju,"This temple and its grounds are gorgeous. I visited during spring and the park between the carpark and temple was filled with cherry blossoms. The temple has a serene atmosphere with some lovely old pine trees and a pond. I've been to Kyoto a few times and of all the Korean temples I've visited, Bulguksa most closely resembles the major temples of Kyoto. Definitely a must do if you're in the area."
Beautifull cherry blossom,"Beautifull cherry blossom, lots of walk. Free tour guide. You can take bus no 10, 11 or 700 to go to Bulguksa. And when you want to return to Gyeongju, just wait at the bus stop that you had arrived. Don't ever cross the street, wait there will be forever. "
Far from the madding crowd!,This Unesco World Heritage site is steeped in culture and history. The entire area of temples and garden is well maintained and one of the most scenic and serene places I have been to. 
No wonder it's a world heritage site ,"Fascinating place to visit and well worth it for an encompassing glimpse into the past. The layout and monks praying in he different buildings contribute to a unique experience. Very easy to get to from downtown by bus 10 11 or 700. Entry was 5,000. There is a small snack shop on site with teas mostly and street food along the access paths to the temple. Otherwise if you're peckish there are many restaurants and coffee shops by the main road where the bus stops are located. Enjoy !"
Beautiful temple,We really enjoyed our trip here. It is a little way out of Gyeongju but definitely well worth the trip. Lovely coffee shop next to the bus stop.
well preserved,large complex of historic structuresbeautiful settinga number of shrinesactive Buddhismlots of locals come to visit
nice temple,"quite a distance from Gyeongju city, i took bus #11 from the opposite of bus terminal and it took almost 40mins to reach. got off the bus at the parking lot and head to the information centre to get a map. you can also get the bus timetable to Seokoram here. got there right before the noon, just nice to avoid the crowd. it isn't very big so i had a quick look before heading to Seokoram. i visited in February when it was still bit chilly, but my guess is that it will look spectacular in Spring/Autumn."
Historically place,"Must go there in April and Autumn time, because there are full of cherry blossom trees and maple tree. Easy to reach by bus and a large car park proivide. Outside the Temple, there are lots of restaurants."
Fascinating temple in lovely setting,This was the first stop on a Cunard cruise ship tour from Busan and well worth a visit particularly with an excellent tour guide as we had.I will let the photos speak for themselves as they give a good variety of the sights to be seen.We had a couple of hours here and you could spend more time on a nice day just enjoying the tranquillity of the place.
Well worth a visit,Gyeongju is a very attractive area and the setting for the temple is beautiful. There was few people at the temple while we were there. It was a cool but sunny day and cherry blossoms were just starting. I can only imagine how beautiful the site will be when the trees are in leaf and the plants are in full blossom. It is well worth while setting aside an hour to visit the temple and surrounding area.
Nice,"Nice place. I guess in autumn or summer it looks even better.Strangely there were no guides (neither volunteers like in Seoul). Shame that they put souvenir shops in the middle of the temple area. Would have been ok just outside the gate, but inside?! We liked it and would have liked it more if not for all the loud tourists. And why on earth they sell whistles in the temple area??? "
A must visit temple,"A beautiful traditional temple you have to visit if you are in South Korea. You will see Gyeongju is different from other cities such as Seoul and Busan. It is more like village, surrounded by mountain. Take a KTX from Seoul (2.5 hours) or Busan (1 hour). From Shin- Gyeongju station, there is a daily bus that goes to all tourist places and you can just simply tap your T-money card to pay that (no complimentary). Bus no#700 is the one that goes to Bulguksa temple. You need to go there on early morning to avoid the crowd. Entrance fee is KRW 5000 per person and you have to walk around 10 minutes from the parking area to the temple. The temple is big with many areas to explore. I think it's best to visit during Spring or Autumn where the trees are colorful. I went there on early March where it was cold and windy. "
Feel the peace ,"Great temple. Do not go only in the crowded places, try to find the quiet areas. Really good for your soul. "
Take your camer out but bring your photographer!,"The place is authentic. I could already imagine the people of old Korea walking past by or entering the gate. However, please do be informed that not all Koreans are hospitable when you ask them to take your photos. They would even run away from you and pretend not to hear you calling out to them asking for their help to take your photos. Please do not misunderstand me. My boyfriend is a Korean and he was requesting help. A number of Koreans were also very helpful. Chinese visitors too were willing to take photographs of you.However, just be careful to choose those whom you will be asking and expect some rejections. Bring also enough clothing in winter so you can enjoy walking on the grounds. Try also the food on the streets, they are quite interesting."
A peaceful place,"It is really quiet and beautiful. There are no too many tourists, so you can stroll around and relax."
Fantastic place,Must visit. Respect no picture policy. Very magical and great panoramas pics! Take a cab or bus to the grotto on top of the mountain!
Beautiful Bulguksa,"Bulguksa temple is a MUST-VISIT attraction in Gyeongju. This temple is exceeded my expectation. The buildings, sculptures and statues are well-maintained. The atmosphere is very peaceful. You can see monks performed religion ceremony there."
Beautiful Temple,We visited the Bulguksa Temple as part of a shore excursion from Busan. The surrounding of the temple are just beautiful with lovely ponds and streams that were frozen and covered with ice. The area is very peaceful and is in perfect condition. This is one of the most important temples in South Korea.The temple buildings were reconstructed using UNESCO approved techniques as this has been a UNESCO site since 1995. They needed to be reconstructed due to age (wood is not as durable as bricks) and warfare. Our tour guide explained Korea's type of Buddhism and the significance of the buildings which helped us understand the significance of the site.I really enjoyed this site and would recommend seeing it.
The best in Gyeongju,The most popular and famous temple in South Korea. Bulguksa is famous for its two towers so be sure to check both of them.
Historic temple,"Easily accessible from Gyeongju city by regular and frequent bus service, Bulguksa is an elegant Buddhist temple. It is easily a short 1-hour visit with a climb up the hill. Within the compound it is an easy walk around the temple. Do respect that photo taking of the idols is prohibited. Combined with a visit to nearby Seokguram Grotto will fill half a day. With car or taxi, it can be accomplished even quicker. A must visit if you are in Gyeongju."
"Lovely temple, easy to get to","Much easier to get to by public transport than it appeared. Several buses leave downtown every 10 mins or so - no 10 might be the easiest. Check the route on Google and wait at a bus stop. Temple is lovely, well worth visiting. Go up the hill too, if you're ok with a 50 min hike, to Seokguram (up past the Bulguksa ticket office). If you dont want to walk, the bus takes nearly the same time. It is a lovely walk, but it is easier downhill!"
Wonderful temple,Bulguksa temple has an amazing architecture and encompasses seven National treasures of South Korea. I highly recommend to be visited either during autumn to enjoy the colourful scenery.
This was once the national temple of Korea,"Bulguksa is a beautiful temple complex set in a verdant hillside, relatively distant from urban intrusions. While I am no expert, the buildings look authentically old -- which is not always the case at many other Korean sights where buildings have been rebuilt in the old style.I took bus number 10 from Gyeongju's Taejongno Road, opposite the express bus terminal and the McDonalds, with a fare of 1,700 won. It was a 40-minute journey, with the bus looping around the many modern hotels facing Bomun Lake before finally reaching Bulguksa.Then it was a 5-minute walk up a gentle slope before reaching the temple gate. Admission was 5,000 won.There were a fair number of tourists and tour groups -- mostly local Koreans with some Chinese and Japanese -- but the place is large enough that you do not feel crowded.From Bulguksa, there is an hourly bus (number 12, also 1,700 won) that goes further up the mountain to the grotto. Admission there is 5,000 won again. Beyond this entrance, there is a further 10 - 15 minutes' walk through the trees before you reach the grotto. If you're pressed for time, give this a miss. There's really nothing worth seeing in the grotto itself except one medium-sized Buddha statue, and as for the views over the surrounding country, nothing that really goes 'wow'.Down at Bulguksa, there are a few shops about 100m from the bus stop from which you can buy snacks and drinks. There's also something that calls itself a restaurant but I saw no one eating there even at lunch time. I suggest you pack your own picnic."
"Easy to get to, really peaceful space","There is a bit of a walk to get to the temple, but it is so worth it. You walk in to the space, and there are 4 huge statues of warriors there to great you. The grounds are lovely and well maintained. You can go in to pray (remove your shoes!) and enjoy the peaceful atmosphere. Look for the stones that are piled high in memoriam of those who have died."
Old Buddhist temple,It's a really quite place to visit. You have to walk a lot though. The trees are really pretty with different colours. It's an old temple with old history. 
Fascinating temple that is monastery-like,"We went on a rainy day which dampened our tour. It is basically a huge estate that has a huge garden area with a pond too.There are different areas you can view - different praying altar and some main halls which you cannot enter, only view from outside.You can take the city bus 10, 11 to reach this place. After that it's a little hike to the entrance where you pay 4,000 won to enter. After the temple, you can also take bus 700 to get to Seokgulam."
Beautiful temple,"Beautiful temple, with amazing architecture. Highly recommended to be visited either during spring or autumn to enjoy the beautiful,colourful scenery. "
Lovely worthwhile experience,"Visited this site whilst staying at Gyeongju. Just under an hour to get to on the number 10 bus. Spent a couple of hours exploring the site - very cultural, great spot for taking photographs, but otherwise not much to do there other than observe. Would recommend not going on a Saturday as it is very busy. Worthwhile visit - allow half a day. "
Picturesque temple,"The temple is quite far away from the Gyeongju city center. You have the option of taking a taxi (I'm guessing at around 30000 won) or taking a bus (#10) there. I did the latter and it took us nearly an hour to get there. The bus drops you off at the bottom of the hill where the temple is located, so you will need to walk up the steep hill to get to the temple entrance. I went during the offseason, but there did seem to be a number of vendors along the path up to the temple entrance selling various things- chestnuts, etc. I can imagine many more vendors during the peak season.The temple itself requires a small fee for entrance. There are a number of areas where you can pray - i.e. gift the temple some money. Like other Buddhist temples, it seemed very engaged in collecting money from worshippers... Nevertheless, the grounds are immaculate. There is a large bell on the grounds. The main building makes for a nice, picturesque photo. There is a small gift shop in the temple as well.Ultimately, there is nothing spectacular or unusual when compared to other Korean temples, but it is worth a visit as it was designated as the first UNESCO World Heritage site in South Korea."
Old Korean Buddhist Temple,"Beautiful gardens around the temple and worth a visit, especially in autumn when the leaves of the gingko and maple trees are in full colour as the weather cools. The temple is classified as historic and scenic by the government, and regarded as a masterpiece of the golden age of Buddhist art during the Silla Kingdom."
"Beautiful Bulguksa Temple in Gyeongju, South Korea","This site is a UNESCO patrimony of humanity which consists of a series of buildings around a main buddhist temple. We got there with bus #10 from across the street of the intercity bus station after a 30 minutes ride. It is indeed a very interesting religious complex dating back several centuries. Most of both buildings were damaged or destroyed by the Japanese invasion in the 16th century, rebuilt later and restored more recently. The first building after the main entrance houses 4 big statues. The path continues until one reaches the main building complex where the other building and the main temples are. It took us a couple of hours to visit them and take pictures. From the nearest bus stop to the temple, bus #12 can take you to the Seokguram grotto, but we decided to go back to Gyeongju with bus #10 to see the museum instead. If you are in Busan you will have to take line orange until the last stop in Nopo then go to the bus station and buy a separate ticket to Gyeongju. We were not able to find a direct connection from Busan. It will take you 2 1/2 hours from Busan train station to the temple."
Just nice during November ,"Nice place to visit .. as a backpacker/ self arrangement .. need more attention for the public transportation, cause it majority use Korean language, no English at all .. long walk from bus station to the entrance.. the fees was $5000 Korea won . "
Beautifully and Sympathetically Restored,"Yes, it is restored, but this has been done very well to retain the original features using appropriate materials. This approach has been endorsed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site. Very colourful and reasonably quiet to allow for peaceful reflection. An extensive site within a rural setting and certainly well worth visiting."
Outstanding,"This was one of the highlights of our trip. Beautiful temple and gardens, and obviously well used, which is good to see. Just going there made us feel peaceful. Very easy to get to from Gyeongju. Highly recommended."
... Why Only 3 Stars You Ask?,"This one was a tough call to make given the consensus that this is regarded as one of if not the most important temples in the country. But on reflection, a month removed from visiting, I can only rate it average. Why? There is virtually nothing original, and not much very old. Of course, that is not the temple's fault, that is due to the Japanese. Yet, being a rebuild is such a tremendous detraction to me. I knew this going in so it was no surprise. However, as with other places in the world where important heritage sites are not original, this fact alone takes so much away from the significance to me.Others, I'm sure, feel very differently. I don't recommend skipping it, but likewise didn't feel awed with my visit."
Beautiful Temple,"Very beautiful temple in a very beautiful location and easy to reach daytrip from Seoul by public transport (KTX, Train and bus) especially in combination with Anapji Pond and Seokguram Buddah Grotto"
Spectacular Temple,"Although fairly recently re-built this temple is nevertheless quite interesting. It has been restored well and is a working temple. It is associated with the Silla Period.Apart from the temples themselves, the grounds are beautiful and the whole place is serene.It is quite a large complex so give yourself plenty of time. There are a lot of interesting and weird features which you might miss if you don't have a guide or you haven't read up before.Worth a visit."
Beautiful grounds,"The temple itself was a bit faded, but the grounds were very nicely maintained. Don't park in the bottom parking lot; you have to walk uphill for .5 km... there is another by the main entrance."
"Beautiful living, working temple lovingly restored","Like others we found this a very serene, peaceful spot to enjoy the beauty of the landscape, the restored buildings and the atmosphere of a living and working temple site. Easily accessed from Gyeongju by bus #10, #11 or #700 (1300 KRW, change given on board bus), this makes a great day trip destination."
Serene and peaceful place.,"When we went there, it drizzled. But overall its a nice place to see and walk around.The serenity is like a breeze in the air. So peaceful and heart-calming.There's a fee to get in and the trail is quite steep on the way to the temple.it's quite far and not many restaurant there. So be sure to bring your own snack or lunch."
My most favourite spot in my Korea trip. A must.,"What can I say, it is beautiful, tranquillity place to spend time walk around, sit anywhere to enjoy the quietness, the peace of this Buddhist Temple.If you can come around October it would be more beautiful as the leaves would change their colour around that time.Very straight forward to get there by bus from Gyeongju. There is a Tourist Information booth in-front of the station. There are 2 stations in Gyeongju, one for the KTX (out of town) and other is right in town. Both have Tourist information centres. And they are very helpful and well informed."
Must-see place in Gyeongju,"This is a great temple with the Buddhist atmosphere, complete with historical relics like pagodas (2 of the main ones in the region ""Dabo tap"" and ""Seokga tap"" are also replicated in the Gyeongju National Museum), bridges, Buddha statues, flagpoles in a nicely sprawled campus.The temple has been renovated numerous times since it was originally built."
Nice complex,Peaceful complex to walk around in. The walk up is steep so bring good trainers. There is a ticket to get in 
Must do in Gyeongju,"Absolutely stunning temple. If there is one thing you must visit in Gyeongju it is this temple. The steps make it different from other Korean temples and the surroundings are beautiful. We were there just before the appearance of the fall foliage, with all the colors it must be even more mesmerizing.You can get there easily by bus (no 10/11/700). It takes just under an hour."
Very beautiful temple and area,The temple is outstanding and the reconstructions it underwent are a witness to Korea's commitment to preserve its past. Highly recommended.
Fabulous!,An enchanting day- bring your camera! The colors and nature are truly breathtaking. It's a short bus ride from town on the #10 or #11 caught at the intersection near the Gyeongju station.
Beautiful,Fascinating temple and grounds. Loved the original steps. Very quiet and peaceful to stroll around. Go!
Beautiful and serene temple,"Bulguksa would have to be one of the highlights of any visit to Gyeongju, as it it one of the most beautiful in all South Korea. Set in such a wonderfully lush Korean landscape, the steps of the temple itself are original (the wooden parts burned down in 1592, much like most of Korea's famous buildings). So many great photo opportunities here, no matter the season! The gift shop here was really good too."
Beautiful historical site,This temple is magnificent. It used to be 15 times bigger but the Japanese army destroyed most of it. You must see this temple if you visit Gyeongju.
The best thing to visit in Gyeongju - and there are many,"What a beautiful place. The highlight of my brief two day visit to Gyeongju, which is saying something as there are so many things to see, and one of the best things I saw in Korea. Visually stunning, beautiful setting, calm and serene, although the crowds of people detract a little from that. As is usually the case, the earlier you visit, the better.Buses 10 and 11 will get you there from Gyeongju; bus 11 is the more direct. It will still take half an hour or so to get there although it's not too far from town and friends of mine enjoyed cycling there. Be prepared for a bit of a climb from the bus stop but it really is worth the effort.If you're feeling up for a hike when you've finished, walk from the entrance left up the hill to Seokguram grotto. It's a 2.2 km walk that takes about 50 minutes. It's uphill all the way and takes some doing - tough on a hot day. You could always take the bus or a taxi (but you'll miss the chipmunks!)"
A don't miss if in Gyeongju,The highlight of my trip to Gyeongju. This (and the Grotto above it) were the best kept an coolest part of visiting here. Don't miss it. A tip is to go to the Grotto first (either by bus or taxi) and then walk down the hiking path to Bulguksa. It takes about 45 minutes down the hill (2.2 km).
Great Architecture with Great Scenery,"Bulguksa temple is around 40 mins bus riding from downtown of Gyeongju. When I went there, it was raining lightly so the temperature was quite pleasant. The admission fee is 5000 won. The temple area is big with a number of magnificent architecture and beautiful nature that is sufficient to be explored in two hours. There is an information counter near to the bus stop that can provide info in English. We took a lot of pictures here even though it was raining as the scenery is simply breathtaking."
Must-see when you're in the vicinity of Gyeongju,"Very nice temple complex in Gyeongju. Not very large, but nonetheless very enjoyable for 2-3 hour visit. Make sure to visit early in the morning, as it can get quite busy later on the day. There's also a lake inside the temple grounds, where you can sit on a bench and just enjoy the scenery. And also make sure to visit the garden with all the 'stacks of stone', gave me quite an eerie feeling."
Magnificent location & buildings,One of the best temples to visit in Korea for the quality of its buildings and its location - you must also visit Seokguram Grotto.
Beautiful place. Must do when in Gyeongju,"The setting in the mountain is very serene and beautiful. The architecture is very unique and bold, almost like Asian-Baroque. The short stroll walking up to the temple was tranquil. We have two kids of 5 and 9, they both enjoyed visiting here as well. Best to go early in the morning as I've heard some people had to get stuck in traffic to get here for an hour on weekend afternoon."
Theme park religion,"This 14th century temple was like religion as Disneyland. Interesting, but no feeling of sanctity due to the crowds of visitors."
pretty sight and good for relation,"I've been there in a nice weather day, and felt relax. It showed different Buddhist culture. Because the temple was located in a hill, we could see the city from the temple. It was a nice view."
Gorgeous heritage site,"This world heritage site is well worth the easy bus ride from town. Hosting beautiful architecture and statues, the grounds are reasonably accessible but it is a bit of a walk up. We carted out an original painting by a monk, from the onsite shop."
Wow!,"The temple is very big, and you can easily get here from Gyeongju with buses 10 or 11 in less than an hour.No photos are allowed in the halls due to praying.The temple is very big, and every hall is explained; here you can feel a very good mood because it's fully immersed in nature.Definitely worth the trip."
Nice Temple,"This was a nice day out. Even during the hottest days in Korea, there is plenty of shade around to explore this site. The site is accessible also with a stroller. Most of the sights are sign posted in English. In regards of parking: there are two options. One at the bottom and one close to the gate. If your english GPS can guide you to the gate, choose that one. It saves you a hike. "
Beautiful temple complex,"A very impressive temple complex with many subtemple buildings. Distinctive Chinese-influence architecture, a lot of nice scenic features, including a sea of paper lanterns."
Beautiful temple,"Really worth the visit, beautiful temple in stunning surroundings. Convenient to go to by bus (3 lines 10,11 and 700), quite far from downtown though, plan a good 30/40 minutes.Very touristy so expect quite a few people there, better to go early in the morning."
Worth a Visit!,"One of my favorite temples in Gyeongju. Very pretty, although when I visited it was annoying because there were some constructions but overall it was great."
A Must,"It is a 2 hour ride from Seoul but breath taking to take a look at. It was a place for our family to reflect and enjoy nature. We took a picture of ringing the bell. Be sure to make your obligatory 1,000 won donation! Worth checking out to fill up your day"
Must visit,A UNESCO World Heritage Site. Can take bus from town to here which will take around 20mins. Enjoyed the view to the temple. Have a bit walk up the temple. Walk around and enjoy the view and architecture. Head down and have your lunch.
Great !,"I visited the temple and it is a gorgeous site. Though keep in mind that most of what you visit is not original and is built in the seventees. Though, it is definitely worth the visit."
has sea of flower lanterns,"good to see in the morning, when there are still less tour groups. accessible by bus with a long walk to the temple. "
"Long walk, nice but not impressive","Bulguksa and Seokguram grotto were our first two stops. Very convenient busses from downtown take people to these sites after which there is a long walk to get to the temples themselves. Bus # 10, 11 and 200 ($1.30) drops one off at the lower parking lot of Bulguksa. Those with mobility issues may prefer to hire a taxi and be dropped off at the ticket office next to the entrance. There is still a long walk to get to the temple site and stairs are always involved in order to see the Buddhas and such. When exiting, Bus #12 stops at both lower parking lot and by the ticket office to take people to/from Seokguram Grotto via a winding mountain road. From the parking lot to the grotto itself is quite a long walk. I noticed a taxi was allowed in to drop people off at the grotto itself. There are no signs indicating distance to be traversed, so I did not make it to the grotto but turned back after a long tiring hike as I have mobility issues. My companion who continued to the grotto had good things to say about it and also noted stairs, stairs and more stairs are involved. There are places to buy food and drinks at both sites.Both temples are surrounded by trees, feel serene, temple-like and not crowded when we were there on a Saturday. Bulguksa is a working temple so one can enter the pavilions and get right close to the figures, read inscriptions, burn incense, read the wishes people inscribed on the many hanging colorful lanterns. It is a nice temple like the many secondary temples one will find in Bangkok or Japan. There are a number of designated ""national treasures"" within the compound-- bridges, pagodas and such, none with a wow factor but perhaps of great historical significance to Korean people. The site itself is ancient but the temples themselves are recent reconstructions; as one often sees in Korea, a notation that previous war(s) usually involving Japan had destroyed the buildings. "
Interesting ,it is a good and interesting place. We spent a great time with friends there I love historical places so I enjoyed time being there. I am sure you will definitely like it. 
Exelent,"A must see in gyeongju area. Nice historic tempel. You Can rent a bike from center OF Gyeongju to bulguksa tempel in 1,5 hour. Very Nice ride"
A prime display of Shilla Buddhist art,"The compound is big. The free guide tour was a bonus. But again, lots of walking & stairs-climbing. The architecture itself is beautiful & impressive."
A little bit disappointed,"Although this temple complex is indeed beautiful, it didn't have the wow factor we were expecting. We were finished in about 30 minutes so don't leave a whole day to see this! "
Beautiful temple and great surroundings,"This is an important and beautiful temple complex in a hill, surrounded by lush vegetation.Very peaceful and (surprisingly) with few tourists around"
Peace in mind,"Where you can find peace outside the noise of cities. I came here after a rainy day, so everything was so fresh and peaceful."
One of the oldest temple,"While visiting Korea we saw many temples and this one is one of the oldest but restored. The site is quite large, very well decorated and just beautiful. It is declared as UNESCO site. Note the temple is located far from Gyeongju center - you'd either need to take a taxi, drive or take a tour. There are many simple restaurants across from the main temple entrance so you could have lunch right there."
The most beautiful temple,This is a beautiful temple that was built in the 8th century. It embodies the Buddhist ideals and represents the Korean Buddhist culture. 
Bulguksa Temple,"The Bulguksa Temple was built in 528 during the Silla Kingdom, in the 15th year of King Beop-Heung's reign (514-540) and was rebuilt by Kim Dae-Seong (700-774). During the Imjin Wars (1592-1598) between Japan & Korea, the wooden buildings were burned to the ground. After 1604, reconstruction and expansion of Bulguksa started, followed by about 40 renovations between then until 1805. This is an impressive temple complex and nice to walk around and when we visited in April, the park had cherry blossoms and Azalea in bloom. This is an excursion well worth it. This is a very impressive temple."
Bulkuk Temple in Kyungju,"This is an old temple in the era of the Unified Shilla which is still used. This is one of World's Treasures. You can walk around slowly in the precincts covered by trees. Thus, you don't worry about the strong heats from the sun. You musr see two pagodas."
Peaceful and Beautiful,"Loved this beautiful hillside retreat. Took the 11 Bus from the Gyeongju Bus center which took about 40 minutes. We were dropped across from the parking lot. There is an information booth that is open 9-5pm. There is about a 5-10 minute hike up a semi steep hill to the temple. There is an entrance fee to the temple. Once in you can walk in you are lead up to the buildings through a very relaxing garden. The buildings and statuary were beautiful. I urge you to take the time. Couple of things, you are walking up hill and up very steep steps so backless sandals or a long skirt not the best idea. After your visit you can stop by the souvenir shop or visit some excellent cafe's across the street."
Absolutely Stunning,This place is incredible. You can feel the history as you walk around. If you want something different and amazing on your travels you have to come here. I got some of the best shots and learned some amazing things while here. It's so peaceful and beautiful. Wonderful place to let go of your worries.
Built in 751AD - restored and magnificent,"This lovely temple and surrounding area is definitely worth a visit. The beautiful lake and garden as you enter is so pretty. There were many school groups on the day we visited. There are some areas with pretty steep steps, but all are fairly accessible via other paths. Faithfully restored to it's original glory, this is a credit to those to keep it in such an immaculate condition. It is so sad that most of South Korea's historical areas were destroyed through the years of war, but it is wonderful that historians have rebuilt so that others can see what things used to be like. We liked the little ""rock garden"" where people place rocks for luck."
one of the famous Buddhist temple,this temple is very unique..and famous for Buddhist people.. they have authentic korean style building with a mountain.. so lovely if you take a picture here... ohh... they have 1 small pig statue with a gold colour.. Legends say.. if you touch this statue..and make a wish you will be have a lot of money.. (sstt i touch twice ) 
A must see!!,"This is worth a visit for sure... it's very serene and picturesque, the temple itself has a unique image and the whole place is set in a beautiful area, with ponds and lush trees. It was quite a big area and it took us a couple of hours to see the whole place. The shop there sold some really pretty things too.From Seoul, we took the KTX train to Singyeongju Station (took about 2 hours or so), from the station we got on bus 700 (bus fare at the time was 1,500 won and took about an hour), Bulguksa temple is the last stop. The admission fee was 4,000 won. I would also recommend to see Anapji pond (Donggung palace and Wolji Pond) on the way back to the station, it's lovely but even more so in the evening or night when it's illuminated... very beautiful!!"
Do it,"We left from Gyeongju bus terminal on bus #11 and it took about 40 minutes. It is a working temple, various prayers/rituals were happening during our visit, felt a bit awkward but no one seemed to mind. Ask for English speaking volunteer guide at information booth on the left after going through the ticketed gate (5000 won pp) and crossing two bridges. Worth it. And not a school group in sight during our visit!"
One of must see spot in Gyeongju,"It takes about 1 hr 30 min to reach there by public bus. It's worth as the temple is quite beautiful. We're staying at Puloonsan Hostel double room is 40,000 KRW/night. There's a lot of youth hostel around also. The eatery place is just few step away. Bulguksa temple is just cross the road. Somebody want to try Boendegi like me (steamed silk worm larva) you need to prepare anti allergy medicine first .... it's good that I don't need to run to hospital because of them. Many food seller here sells Boendegi and other yummy stuff."
The Buddha's birthday,"Bulguksa Temple, Gyeongju, South Korea.Not for the first time has one of my adventures in the Far East coincided with the Buddha’s birthday and a visit to a Buddhist temple. However this time it was serendipity which brought this about – a typhoon had prevented a planned side trip to Japan thereby allowing time for a longer visit to the treasures of the UNESCO World Heritage sites of Gyeongju (the Museum without walls) and the National Park.The Bulguksa Temple is just one* of those many treasures and while the site will remain forever in my memory thanks, additionally, to a middle aged Korean lady in the gift shop who, in reference to my age, white hair and beard, enquired if I was Father Christmas (a question I have been asked very many times across Asia and the middle-east).*In fact there are no less than 7 individual National treasures within the boundary of the Temple itself and I recommend all of them (even if you have to queue). Unfortunately but quite understandably the Temple is not completely disabled friendly.Strangely unlike some other Buddhist sites I have visited over the years the Monks themselves were not in evidence.In reality there are just so many treasures in the whole of Gyeongju that I strongly recommend, should you have the time, visitors should try to cover as many as possible from the Grotto of Seokguram to the burial mounds in the city itself. There is even a purpose built structure which covers the excavated tomb of a 5th century Silla cavalryman which I highly recommend.One should not overlook the Donggung Palace and Wolji Pond (formerly called Anapji) which have been splendidly restored – these are, to my mind best viewed at night when they are illuminated and there are City Bus tours which include them on their itineraries – drop into the local Tourist information office near to the bus station(s) where the staff are most helpful."
One of the Must See Temples,Don't leave Korea without visiting this area and especially this temple. Anytime is a good time to visit here
Worth the trip,One of the most important Buddhist temples in South Korea. Gets crowded fast so get there early. Excellent location and don't forget to add the nearby Seokguram Grotto. Gyeongju is easily accessible from Seoul by high speed train.
Bulguksa temple,"Managed to walk up the slop and reach the main temple, weather is good and nice building. There were many people there, mostly are Korean tourist. You can make prayer in the temple. Didn't see any monk living here, I guest this place is only for tourist to visit."
Highlight of the Gyeongju area,"This was the best thing in Gyeongju that we visited. Much better than the sites within Gyeongju itself. The temple complex has beautiful architecture and the area is quite peaceful. We enjoyed spending a few hours roaming around here. It was easy enough to take the bus from Gyeongju, although if I had to do it again I might have rented a car instead, as it seems like there were a few other attractions in this area that we weren't able to get to given our lack of personal transportation."
Beautiful Temple in a peaceful setting,"This UNESCO listed site is a little out of the way but well worth a visit. On the map of the site there are 24 places of interest (including 6 Halls, 2 small Pagodas, 3 Pavilions and 4 Gates)"
A nice walk ,Nice traditional Korean temple. Realised that u can just sirens half a day in the temple walking around enjoying the greenery. 
Obviously a must see,"Took the city tour bus to this location which was helpful because the traffic was terrible due to a national holiday. Yes, the tour is only in Korean but we had read up on everything beforehand and all signs are in english."
Interesting temple ,... But very crowded. So many school-classes there that it was hard to get into a relaxed state of mind as usually when visiting a Buddhist temple. But nevertheless interesting an worth seeing. To get there take bus 10 or 11 in Gyeongju and you also will get some scenic tour during the way to the temple. Tickets to be bought on the bus.
The biggest temple with beautiful grounds,We went to this temple on a beautiful spring day. It consists of a well-maintained set of buildings and gardens. It was close to Buddha's birthday so there were paper lanterns everywhere. Parking costs 500Won and entrance was 5000Won per person. There are vendors as you walk up the hill selling everything from toasted silkworms to umbrellas. Very nice place. 
Great temple and key to Korean history...,"Key is the golden buddha and the boar in wood under the roof. The boar does carry a magic and makesyou rich if you stroke it, a Millionaire in KRW...Worth visiting. Gets busy, very busy at weekends"
"Nice temple, lots of tourists","What happens when you get your temple in every tourist book? All the tourist come there. Beautiful place, but too many other visitors. Perhaps I should have gome during a weekday. Nice trail going up the mountain from this temple."
Stunning,"Truly a beautiful place to visit, you need a few hours here to stroll around, take in the history.BREATH TAKING!!!Please remember to respect the signs that ask you not to photograph certain spots"
impressive,"Impressive temple complex, but located quite far from the KTX station. If you go there from the station you need bus 701, takes about 1 hour. It's a nice area to walk around, there was a park with cherry trees in blossom near the temple which made the trip worth it."
"Temple,Grotto,and costs","I went here today. It costs l700 KW from Gyeongju center by Bus #10. It was 5000 KW entrance fee, no discounts for seniors unless Korean nationals. As other reviewers wrote it is beautiful and worthwhile. There is a shuttle bus to take you to the grotto to view the Buddha which takes about 20 minutes and leaves on the hour. The grotto /temple is another 5000 KW. It is not a short trip from town but doable. I would recommend coming in early April to see the cherry blossoms."
Nice temple with beautiful surroundings,"This was my first visit to a Korean Buddhist temple so I can't really compare but it was definitely a nice experience. You can actually enter the buildings (wooden floors, shoes off) and see people pray. Great architecture, sculptures and decorations. There's a nicely landscaped park surrounding the temple, but the whole place was crowded with tourists and school classes.I recommend the 3km hike up the mountain to Seokguram for some more peace and quiet (and a little exercise)."
Tourist but educational and beauitful,"This is a big tourist spot but it is a beautiful temple and is very peaceful! It's only a quick bus ride from the Gyuengju city center. Around the temple are other museums, parks and toombs to visit as well."
A beautiful temple,"This is one of the most famous temples in Korea.For those interested in Buddhism architecture and the influence of Buddhism in Korea this place would be an interesting place to visit. The site of the temple itself was smaller than I expected. The thing which I hope they had was perhaps more information on the site ie. information cards, etc. That would definitely enhance the meaning towards the visit. There are a lot of beautiful sites within the area where you can just rest under the shade. A visit during spring might be more beautiful as flowers would have bloomed by then and by summer it will be greener. The only thing which I would warn visitors is to avoid going there during public holidays. Having need to crowd to see the temple was not really pleasant. Perhaps that did affect how I evaluated my trip. Walking up the hill to get to the temple was not too bad either. The walk was not too steep nor long. There are also a lot of food stalls outside of the temple's compound, if you get hungry after your trip."
worth the busride,"Requires some climbing, so be warned. it's an old temple complex on a hill. It's worth a visit. The variety of building is quite impressive."
Respect,Very interesting place to visit. To know Korean culture and traditions.Relaxing place and amazing views.
Be mesmerized...,Worth the trip. it is afterall the Epitome of Shilla architectural talent. Highly recommended. I could have imagine how beatiful it would look in autumn. We came in winter and it was still as beautiful despite some section being closed for renovation. Plan to visit Bulguksa with Seokguram in a day trip. We did ours from Busan. 
Lovely Temple in the Mountains,This was a lovely Temple in the Mountains. The Cherry trees were in bloom long with the Azaleas. One of the major pagodas was being repaired so there was construction interfering with some views. The temple has good signage that explains the buildings. Expect lots of steps and climbing. 
Lovely place .,"Spring season in Gyeonju , South Korea is beautiful. The Bulguksa temple is surrounded by glades of Cherry blossom and Magnolia trees is which is the center and seat of prayer of Shila Buddhism .Bul-guk-sa - "" Land of Buddha "" - a small piece of paradise with serene calm and beauty !"
Fun trip to Temple ,Visiting this temple was very calming. Very pretty to walk through and see their culture. Right now they are preparing for Buddha's birthday so lanterns are being installed. A must see! 
Huge temple complex,Temple complex area where you could look the actual ceremony take place. Must visit for historical and cultural lover.
"Great woodwork, neat sculpting and nice area","The pleasures of Bulguksa are subtle and if you know a little about Buddhism,one is certain to enjoy it more. As a showpiece of the Shilla dynasty it is not an overwhelming pleasure, but had many little treasures. Do look out for the bronze work, the wood work particularly of the Dragon near the cloud bell and a rich range of 8th century imagination on and of the Buddha and Buddhas. When we visited the temple grounds themselves were a sight due to the lovely cherry blossoms. It was packed but not noisy, but still best to visit early morning for the peace a temple can bring. Don't forget your picnic mat. Temple is 70 %baby stroller friendly. This is a good intro to the hilly charms of Gyeongju."
A nice temple with good cherry trees and buildings which make good settings for photography,I went there to take photos of cherry trees making use of the temple buildings as good coloured background. The temple itself is quite popular for visitors within Korea and foreigners alike. It is also a spot for maple tree sightings in autumn. This is not a very large place and there is no need to plan for a prolonged stay. A shop near the main entrance of the temple sells a good variety of small souvenir items which are of reasonable prices and many of such items feature the temple or Buddha. There is also a small lake outside where some angling activity can be seen.
Interesting Sights,"Great temples, beautiful grounds, and interesting people-watching as many tour groups were there. Worth a stop while in the area."
Beautiful Grounds!,Beautiful gardens and awesome temple buildings. Many individual Buddha statues in the individual temples...just wonderful. The park grounds in front of the temple are so peaceful! Just great!
Appreciated the architecture,"The name 'Bulguksa' suggest the nation (Guk) of Buddha (Bul). It is a working buddhist temple. Photography of the inside of the halls is not permitted. It was my first visit after the field trip in high-school. I think this is the place you come for architecture. The entrance structure (steps) represent beginning and the end of life. I think they may have renovated the road lead to the temple. However, the buildings stayed largely same and still told the ancient history. To me the highlights of the temple are two pagodas in the garden before the worship hall. However, unfortunately, I found one of them was under renovation in a steel structure. I was able to see it but found a replica in the Gyeongju national museum. I found some monks and people are praying in a service when we visited although it was still crowded with kids in field trips."
Seoul-less,"Not the best temple, definitely better to see in Korea. Nice gardens, but the temple itself was fairly small. There was also a bit metal shed-like structure in the middle which sort of ruined it."
Bulguksa Temple,Went in November when the weather is all chill and comfortable. I was there for the scenery and it was indeed breathtaking. Saw maple leaves for the first time in my life and seeing how all the different colours of leaves can exist to create a beautiful picture excites me.The place is really accessible with buses and worth the journey if you are seeking for a peaceful and therapeutic experience.
UNESCO world heritage list ,"Took the haeundae mugunghwa train and got off at bulguksa station, from there take bus 11 and get off right in front of the bottom of the hill, a short 5 minutes walk will get you to the entrance of the bulguksa. I went on a rainy day, gave a little different feeling to the temple and garden!"
A Must See in Gyeongju,"The temple grounds were really big and spacious. If you like history, architecture and nature, you definitely should visit this place. It takes you back in time as you walk along the temple. I would like to visit again in the Fall when the surrounding trees get colorful. I think it would be really beautiful during the Fall season."
Amazing !,"Bulguksa Temple is a nice tempel to visit in Gyeongsangbuk-do region ,about 35 minutes car ride from gyeongju city ."
Expansive Temple Grounds,"We were there the second week of March. Apricot blossoms were just starting to show and cherry blossom trees were starting to bud. In about two weeks I'm sure the place explodes, but then it probably packs out with people too. As it was, there were very few people there, which made it a very nice, relaxing experience."
Must see,"We went there in march so I think we miss the beauty of the nature around. Still this was very nice to see, the place is very peaceful. To get there we took the bus 1-1 at terminal station which has a stop directly near the temple."
Serene and Peaceful,"Got to this Temple by Bus 10/11. You'll see a big spacious carpark and a hill when you first alight. Just walk up the stairs up the hill and slowly stroll along the path, you'll find the entrance to Bulguksa. It's rather spacious with many different parts to look at. The Pagoda was under restoration when I went so I'm not sure how it looks and feels in real life. I must say that I like the stroll in and out of the temple as there are many trees and you kinda feel peaceful. You won't spend too long a time here though, so you can hop on another bus and go on to Seokguram."
Really Nice,"Im not a huge fan of asian temples, i believe they are all the same but theres pretty much a lot to see in this place, not only one temple but a lot of them. So if you love them, you are really going to enjoy it."
Wonderful Temple full of history,"This is my second time at the temple, but the first with a professional guide. The guide helped bring much more history to the forefront and provided a deeper experience of history and of the connections across India and China with Korea in terms of Buddhism. The temple is very large so allow an hour . it is reconstructed and has extensive grounds which were at one time water separating the temple areas. Peaceful, relaxing and wonderful photo opportunities. plan on extra time so you can also visit the grotto temple by hiking up the mountain just outside of the exit"
Overhyped - not much unless your really into history,"I love a good UNESCO site but honestly I didn't really think this temple was anything special - there are so many more visually appealing in Korea and unless you are interested in the long, deep history of this place you won't find much interesting. In fact there is very little signage in English so you are likely to be disappointed, but the Grotto nearby is amazing so really you will probably end up doing both - just don't hold your breath. This place is small, and rather pedestrian for an average non-Korean, and even with a interest in history I found it hard to 'get into'"
A step back in time,A great place to start a tour of Gyeongju. Visited the temple and then walked through the forest to the Shrine. 
Beautiful Temple,"This historic temple was absolutely gorgeous. It was quite the bus ride from Gyeongju (aboit 20min) but it was worth it. I, myself, found the temple to be beautiful and reading about the temple was intresting as well, but I could also see how some people can be ""templed out"" after awhile the temples do start to look the same. Although this one does have a beautiful complex on the side of the mountain, with a pond and small waterfall."
A must-do in Gyeongu !! ,An amazing temple in Gyeonju !! It is easy to go by bus from town. There is a wonderful state tower that is a Korean national treasure. There were a few people when I visited but it was mainly because I was there on January.
Beautiful old temple,"This is a beautiful old temple well worth a visit. Easily accessible by bus from central Gyeongju, the gardens look nice in Winter and would probably look amazing in other seasons."
Beautiful Temple,This temple can easily reach by the bus. You might walk for a while to get to the temple. A peaceful place and a good choice to visit in Gyeongju
Very old budhist temple,"We went there during winter, so, I couldn't really see the beauty of the garden as everything was dry. But, it still has its beauty with pond and bridge above it."
it's a must monument not to be missed,"in a very easy area to acces by car, all weel indicated, not expensive entrance and inside is a marvellous temple"
Bulguksa buddhist temple,It might be the most famous buddhist temple in Korea. Several national treasures and one of must-sees while staying in Korea. 
Tranquil and stunning,"Located near Gyeongju, on mount Toham, built during the Silla period. Completely lost in greenery, it's one of the most beautiful and serene temples in Korea. It's also an important national treasure and the head temple of the Jogye order. Since it's very close to the city, I'd definitely recommend to visit this temple when in Gyeongju."
Recommended ,This is definitely a temple to visit in the area. We went there by car and hence i am not aware of other means of transportation. The temple is quite interesting as well as the area around (where u can have a nice walk). 
Must Visit in Gyeongju,There are a lot of buses providing service from Gyeongju City to Bulguksa. Is a famous spot with historical value.
Beautiful Temple With Stunning Grounds,"This is a ""working temple"" and many services where going on during our visit. The architecture is uniquely Korean and the well manicured grounds were immaculately maintained. Even in December, the grounds and setting were quite beautiful. A must see in Gyeongju."
Well worth a visit if you're in Gyeongju,"If you came to visit Gyeongju, it would be a must to visit. Take bus 10 or 11 from the city (1500 won) or bus 700 from Singyeongju station. There's nowhere to store your luggage at the temple. The buses will announce the stops in English if it is a tourist site. From the bus stop, it's 10 mins walk uphill to the entrance. Ticket is 4000won. The Gyeongju Day Tour is 20000 won, if it includes entrance fees, I think it is well worth it because you will see much more and less hassle. The bell was barricaded and it was not possible to ring it. The temple was peaceful. If you are going to Seogurum, remember that the bus leaves at 40 past the hour from here. Read review.Bus 700 basically go to most of the tourist sites. Each ride tends to be about 1300won except those further away. If you have 3 people, it is definitely cheaper to take to any tourist sites except those out of the city. Starting taxi rate 2800 won."
interesting stop; bit of a walk,"Visited the Temple as part of a day tour in Gyeonju. Certainly worth the visit and admire the stone workmanship of the Buddha. Note that the walk from the parking area, while mostly on a smooth path, includes a number of steps at the temple itself so would not be for elderly or for any with carriages or wheelchairs. Make sure to ring the giant bronze bell at the entrance!"
"The ""must-do"" Temple in Gyeongju!","If you've made the effort to visit Gyeongju then a visit to Bulguksa Temple must surely be top of your things to see! The temple is easily accessible by local buses from Gyeongju town centre (No. 10, 11 or 700 / Fare W1500). From the bus stop it is a short walk up to the main fate where the entrance fee is W4000. The temple complex is delightful, especially if you are lucky enough to catch the autumn colours. The main Temple is very distinct as it is raised on a stone platform. Unfortunately they are currently restoring one of the main pagodas and it is covered with an unsightly white box, which does require some creative photo-angles to get a snap of the front of the temple without it spoiling your picture! It is most definitely NOT a visitor centre as has been suggested in other reviews, but is a temporary structure whilst they carry out essential restorations. Around the back of the main temple are a number of smaller shrines with stunning mandalas and woodwork."
"One of the ""must-see"" in Gyeongju",An ancient large temple complex dated back from hundred years ago. It is fascinating to see that all the buildings are well maintained. It also have a small park to relax after walking around the complex. 
Temple from Silla Kingdom.,"Lots of treasures and cultural relics forming South Korea's history. This temple has beautiful garden walks, colorful and solemn temples and 2 pagodas. The only thing is, Its crowded and when We went there some parts are under renovation but this instance is forgivable. Open all year round with entrance fee, parking available and accessible with public or private transportation."
"Beautiful, worth visiting","Although not in the best shape currently, it is a beautiful place, and worh visiting. If you are not very keen to visiting classical museums and exhibitions, this can be very helpful assistance for getting the impression about the architecture, crafts, and ancient lifestyle."
Beautiful temple but is being ruined ,"Went here the other day and it really is stunningly beautiful. The grounds are absolutely perfect and are worth a visit just in itself. When we went all the leaves were starting to fall and it looked great with all the colours. The temples themselves are very pretty although no different to temples you find in Japan, China or Thailand. It's the setting that makes it stand out. Photos are not allowed inside the templesFor me I felt it was spoilt by the building of a huge metal monstrosity right behind the main temple front. No matter which angle you looked at it from you can just see this ugly building right in the shot. I think they are building some sort of cultural centre within the complex but it is in such an awful spot "
Nice temple,Another nice temple-great to see during the leaves turning into autumn colours. Very touristy though. Nice to have a walk around and explore but don't spend more than a hour.
This temple is worth seeing,"I enjoyed every minute in Gyeongju, and this temple is simply amazing.You have really nice view there and considering that I was in autumn, the colours were just perfect!"
Amazing Temple,"I was able to visit the temple during a (on and off) rainy day which looking back was actually a good thing since there wasn't as many people there.Great views all around, make sure to walk around the entire place, makes you respect what was once built so many years ago (was rebuilt)"
"Breathtaking scenery in the Autumn, and temples","Went early Nov 2015. Plentiful of green, yellow, orange, red, and almost purple colored trees. Spectacular views. Really loved the visit, especially with the ponds and water added. Not too crowded, easy to access and beautiful temples. Do recommend."
Temple in a beautiful garden,"Its not really hard to get here from singyeongju stn in gyeongju, we only take on bus no 70 and only 30 mnt we arrived at the temple, actually in gyeongju so many places that we can visit, along the bus we can see many places we can visit as a tourist you have to stay in the town for a day, aftet get out of the bus its only a meters we entered the gate and find a beautiful garden with a lake and the bridge..the tree starting to get red so the viewbis magnificent, as we go further we see another gate with a statue as a guard, and then we see the temple..its a big and have so many building.."
Lovely Colours of Autumn,"It's not that I'm not a fan of ancient buildings. And here we are talking about a representative relic of Gyeongju and a UNESCO World Cultural Asset. This is a place which boasts of 1500 years of worship outliving many dynasties and kings. The beauty of the temple itself and the artistic touch of the stone relics are known throughout the world. But what really struck me on top of the temple's beautiful architecture was the beautiful colours of autumn, scenes that I have yet to see anywhere else before. Although I am hardly a professional or even amateur photographer, the scenery was jaw-dropping. Rather than do it an injustice by describing it, I shall just let the pictures speak for themselves."
Amazing place ," Even though it was crowded, it's a beautiful place to appreciate history, tradition and breath taking landscapes."
Beautiful Place,"Have visited for 3 times and always amazed by this place. Although it's always packed by many people (groups of students, families).. it's still the must visit place in Gyeongju especially during Autumn!"
Beautiful autumn leaves,Easy access by taking bus #10 or 700 from train station. Touring time 1 hr. There are quite a lot of maple trees and it's worth visiting in autumn.
Autumn leaves not as reddish as i expected,"The temple is full of tradition Korean style. Sacred places and many domestic Koreans go there. However, the leaves arent turn red yet and a bit disappointed. "
Must Visit,"It was an amazing experience visiting the Number 1 historic and scenic site in Korea, listed as one of the UNESCO World heritageLook at your 10 won coin now! Thie is the dabotap stone pagoda, one of the south Korea's national treasures is located here!"
Bulguksa Temple Gyeongju,The temple was easy to find. Entrance fee to be paid before enter. The temple itself is made by stones compared to many other temples in Korea which are made by wood. We just were looking around and did not spend much time to investigate the history ot this temple. Some renovation was ongoing during this time. A good place to visit if you are near by. 
One of THE temples in Korea,"Located in the town of Gyeongju, Our group of 4 took a taxi all the way from Busan, it saved us a lot of time and hassle to get here. Taxis in this part of Korea are staggeringly cheap for a 1st world country, so if you're 3 or more it can be so worth it for inter town travel. The temple complex is so austere and understated, you can wander for hours around the grounds... There are several temples accessed by stairs and wooded trails. The staff are quite helpful and can provide information in English, and there are scheduled English tours as well."
UNESCO WORLD CULTURAL HERITAGE,The construction began in 751 and was completed in 754. It served as the center of Silla Buddhism and of prayer for the protection of the country from foreign invasion . It was burned a by the Japanese in 1593 and was completely restored from 1969-1973. In 1995 it received the UNESCO designation. 
Serene Bulguksa,"There are several temples in a huge area built for various Kings of the Shilla Dynasty. This Bulguksa is just one of it.The ones in the photographs is about 43 years old; rebuilt after the originals were destroyed by Japanese invaders in 1593. The original complex was completed in the year 774. Construction took 24 years.The temples are on two levels. Very peaceful and serene setting.The best times to visit are in Spring and Autumn.Gyeongju is very beautiful and youthful in Spring.Thousands of cherry blossom trees and creamy white magnolias, the size of a face bloom. Canaries add contrast with their small golden yellow blooms. These are planted neatly in the temple grounds. In Autumn the scene is golden and stark later in the season.The eaves of the temple roofs are beautifully painted and complements the gardens."
It's ok.,"The thing about temples and palaces in Korea is once you've seen one, you've seen them all. It's quite a trek to the temple and it was cool, not amazing. "
Most interesting place to visit in the area,"The monastery is the most interesting place to visit in the area. From the carpark it's a nice scenic walk past a pond with lots of fish waiting for you at the bridge. Our visit was at the beginning if autumn with still pleasant temperatures and beautiful changing colours of the trees. The one pagoda is now under reconstruction after cracks were found. A steel construction/building is covering the pagoda.The staircase access remains the most memorable picture.A very peaceful place, that is open for a templestay and worth a visit"
Cultural Highlight,"Beautiful Temple, very peaceful. Visit in October as weather perfect and not too many tourists, plenty of opportunity to take lovely photographs"
Beatiful Setting ,Beautiful setting in the side of the mountain. Although part was under renovation it was still incredible. I was warned in other reviews about the crowds but I found it was spread out enough to alleviate this somewhat. The hike down from Seokguram Temple was awesome with a natural spring to enjoy half way down.
A must see when you visit Gyeongju.,Out of the main town but well worth the trip. Best to use public busses to visit as they are easy to get and direct.
An Enjoyable Hike and a Unique Buddhist Temple,"Bulguksa Temple affords the visitor scenic beauty, a healthy hike, and a special Buddhist site. While the prayer area is less accessible than some other Korean Buddhist Temples, such as Haeinsa, the total experience is a rewarding one. If you are in Gyeongju, Bulguksa is a must see."
Be prepare to walk a lot up and down stairs,"Go if it is part of the group tour, or you are a devoted buddhist. Also be prepare walk a lot up and down stairs. It took around 1.5 hours for a round trip back to parking lot."
Worth half a day,"When I visited here, I was not sure what to make off it, but on reflection I feel it is worth a visit. Its quite modern and built on an old temple that was destroyed at some time. But all in all its worth a half day."
Temple,It's really incredible..although it is not like Haeinsa but i enjoyed it a lot.. If you like temples and historical places you will enjoy this place
One of the oldest n the most beautiful temple n South Korea,"If u like Buddhism or if u r interested in Shilla Kingdom's history, u should stop by this temple."
Too many visitors,"I was a bit dissapointed by Bulguska Temple. The location is very beautiful, its outside of town (easy to reach with bus 10 or 11) on a mountain and in a forest. There are so many visitors however, that the atmosphere is very unpeaceful. There are people all over the place taking Selfies of themselves infront of every single tree or building, there is a lot of shouting going on, kids screaming etc. Also, in the centre of the temple there is a new very ugly building that looks like a big container, and that quite destroys the ""whole picture"". "
Beautiful shrine ,Go. Go. Its lovely. I really enjoyed being here with my family. It's a good historical way to learn about Korean history. 
Very historic,The Shilla empire flourished for over a thousand years. They started before Christ and ended around the 10th century. It's really quite something else. Definitely worth a visit to see the architecture and walk the grounds to feel the serenity of the place. 
Nice temple grounds,The Bulguksa Temple is located a bit out of the city and is accessible by bus. The temple grounds itself are nice and its a good example of Korean architecture. It can't compete to similar temples in Japan and China since it is smaller and has less buildings but its worth going do and is beautiful in its own right and worth going to if you are interested in 16th century Korean architecture.
Bulguksa Buddhist Temple,"Ancient complex of Buddhist pagodas of different sizes. Inside most pagodas you will see a monk softly banging a kind of drum, or tinkling a bell & chanting in a deep resonant voice. As you wander between the pagodas there is a sense of peace & serenity. It's a lovely place & worth visiting. I would allow 90mins to be able to stroll all around at leisure."
A definite must see!,Gorgeous! The scenery around the temple is magnificent. One could easily spend a whole day enjoying the quiet peacefulness of this temple after the hustle and bustle of Seoul.
Gorgeous Silla-era Buddhist temple,"This temple complex is a standout in Korean Buddhist architecture for it's multiple stone staircases, wooden structures and statuary. Definitely check it out."
Beautiful Buddhist temple,This beautiful and large Buddhist temple complex is at some distance from Gyeongju. The road from Gyeongju to the temple during the cherry blossom season is magnificent: kilometers of cherry blossom canopy.
Feel the zen,One of the famous historical places in Gyeongju. Discover the history of Buddhism in Korea and amazing architectures.
Great places to meditate,Really enjoyed this visit. The chance to meditate in numerous temples throughout the complex was fantastic. The rock garden was cool. And all the great photo spots were amazing. 
Peaceful,I was a bit disappointed-didn't find anything unique here. There were some pretty cherry/plum blossom trees along the path leading to the temple. The grounds are very large but there's not much to see/read. We later found that it is possible to walk to bulguksa from seokguram grotto(a 2 km walk)-this would probably have been nicer than taking the bus.
Great View,"I'm not Buddhist, but the view from the temple was amazing. We took the bus from downtown Gyeongju, about a 20 min ride."
Top Sightseeing Place,"We enjoyed our visit to the temple and the areas around, though some of it was under construction when we visited, it was still a beautiful visit."
Very scenaric and comfortable place,Beautiful scenary and peaceful environment. Enjoyed the view very much. It would be even better if during autumn or winter season where leaves changing to yellowish colour. Or winter snow.
Great and well reconditioned temple,There is a certain monotony to the temples in Korea. This's one has such beautiful surroundings it stands out above the rest
Interesting Temple to Visit,"You need to have at least a sense of appreciation for historical structures, and more specifically (in this case), temples. If you do, then the Bulguksa Temple would be a recommended stop. Like anything historical, ideally, join a guided tour to get the best amount of information to give you a much greater appreciation of its architecture and history.Worth visiting."
"BEAUTIFUL, PEACEFUL --> I TOTALLY IN LOVE WITH THIS TEMPLE!","I just stayed at Gyeongju for 2days 1night only and this was the place I liked the most.It was very clean, fresh and peaceful when I visited. I just spent half day there and I was very regret about this. I wished I could have stayed there whole day. The temple is on the middle of mountain (Sukguram grotto is on the top of the mountain). So you should wear sport/hiking shoes to have a convenient trip and enjoyable time there. It would be regrettable if you don't bring camera. There are many spots that you don't want to miss to share with others.I visited there in April 2014, the view of cherry blossom was very impressive!(I don't know why I can't chose the April 2014 at the below button, so I have to click on August 2014)"
No. 1 temple in Gyeongju,"If you have only time for one temple in Gyeongju, this is the one. Declared UNESCO cultural asset, it was completely reconstructed after being destroyed in the 16th century during the war against Japan, and renovated many times. The admission costs 4, 000 KWR. One of the two pagodas in front of the main hall is being restored at the moment. Buses 10 and 11 leaving downtown Gyeongku make circular routes and stop at the temple. If combining with Seokguram, bus 12 links the two and departs from Bugulksa every hour at :40."
A haven of relaxation and culture ,"Visited as part of a educational tour. I enjoyed walking through the grounds and seeing the wonderful preservation of the buildings. The pathways and walkways were also well designed for those in a wheelchair, which is a big plus. "
Highlight of Gyeongju - Peaceful Reflectoin,"We arrived by mass transit - bus t - and enjoyed a late in the day stroll throughout this magnificent site. The layout and the various areas of this temple allow one time to reflect and meditate while in the midst of other tourists. Location is in a great spot near the Grotto of Seokguram, to which you can walk (although up hill can be a bit straining especially if hot)."
Nice stop,Good stop later in the day when we visited here. This place is huge and its hard to see in just one stop.
Beautiful architecture in this UNESCO site,"Beautiful architecture, excellent carvings and painting, although the paint was a bit faded. I enjoyed walking through its grounds and found early springtime to be rather quiet and not busy."
Not to be missed,"Bulguksa Temple is the reason to visit Gyeongju. It sits on a series of stone terraces set among gnarled pines.There are 2 bridges as you approach, one with 33 steps representing 33 stages to enlightenment and pagodas stand in 2 courtyards. Event thou is crowded it is peaceful at the same time. From here take a bus to Grotto of Seokguram and after the visit hike down back to Bulguksa. It's an easy walk in the forest. Allow at least half a day to explore this area and both temples. If you are staying at the Bomun Lake area take a taxi, is inexpensive and quick."
wow wow wow,if you are in gyeongju take a taxi and visit this temple it is worth I spent 3 hours but it was not enough very beautiful paintings and very beautiful atmosphere I definetly recomend to visit this temple 
"For Korea, it is the best temple to visit","The Fish Bell is really the most amazing fish bell I have ever seen in any Buddhist temple. It is an old, beautiful temple. Don't know why the Japanese forgot to destroy this one entirely but thankfully they did. Go around the toilets. The structures there are beautiful as well. Honestly, it was the ONLY temple in Korea we have seen where one can feel some spiritual vibration. I know it sounds like a new age phrase. Hopefully the meaning gets conveyed. From down town take a bus and then be prepared to walk uphill quite a bit. There is also sprawling meadow on your way to the temple. All together a beautiful sight. One thing that bothered me the most is the useless No Photo sign. Every Korean proceeded to ignore it and so did the foreigners. Give digital cameras to the idiots and the idiots will act like senseless, rude idiots. The officials were simply watching and did not say anything to anyone."
Silla acrhitecture at its best,"It sits on a series of stone terraces set among gnarled pines.It displays excellent carpentry and skilled painting in the interior woodwork and eaves of the roofs. There are 2 bridges as you approach, one with 33 steps representing 33 stages to enlightenment. Pagodas stand in 2 courtyards."
Too Crowded,"Very crowded on Budha's Birthday so even though admission is free that day, I do not recommend it as I suspect you need peace and tranquility to truly appreciate the temple. The bus ride from downtown to the temple is about 40 minutes and goes through some nice areas of the city that we wish we had time to explore. "
Well preserved Buddhist Temple.,The highlight of this beautifully preserved temple is that there are genuine devotees around the place - it is a working temple. You can get to hear the chants and see Buddhist worship in action. It is also particularly colourful and photogenic.  You should try to combine your visit with a trip to the nearby Seokguram Grottoe. You can get there by catching a shuttle bus which leaves once an hour. Spend an hour at the Grottoe and you have probably had a perfect morning or afternoon.
Not to be missed,"From downtown, one can take bus no 10/11 , 1500won, to get to the temple. Reaching the temple bus stop, cross the road and buy your entrance ticket 5000won. The temple opens its door as early as 6.30am and if you visit in the afternoons now , it is very hot. The surrounding gardens are well maintained and the landscape is simply beautiful and magnificent. Look out for the two national treasure bridges, the one on the right has 33 steps, representing the 33 stages of enlightenment. Up next are the 2 national treasures, stoned pagodas. We prefer Dabotap, 10.3m high, with a stone lion as guardian on its platform. Visiting each hall, one can see images of Buddha and Bodhisattvas. However, no cameras please. After visiting this temple, do hop on bus no.12 to get to the other world heritage site , Seokguram."
Amazing setting and scenery,"Great temple with a lot of history. While we were there, we say a couple different locations where monks were worshipping. Beautiful flowers and Architecture."
Nice,"We went there in late April. Luckily, we can see lots of cherry blossom at the entrance of the temple and it was fantastic!Nice temple, but since I visited many temples in Korea, so I couldn't feel any difference among temples."
beautiful heritage temple,"beautiful temple, with nice gardens. Terrific heritage UNESCO world heritage site. Quiet a bit to walk around. Interesting buildings."
