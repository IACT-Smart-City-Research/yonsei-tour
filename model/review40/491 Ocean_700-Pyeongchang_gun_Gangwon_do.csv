Loved the outdoor springs be careful with the river ,"My kids loved this place especially after spending several other days outside doing winter stuff. The water park is warm , clean and there is a lot to do. The wave pool and water park were fun. We really enjoyed the outside sauna and pool. The river, tube pool was a bit too strong though and I would say almost dangerous for kids under 8. It’s just rough and as an adult, I felt a bit seasick afterwards. Other than that, great fun. Try to get there either before lunch or just after since they will close in the early evening. They also close on Monday’s, so schedule your trip around that. When we went the cafeteria was a bit backlogged and took a while to get the food so possibly order 30 minutes before you think your kids will get hungry. The water park was a highlight of our trip for our kids so I would recommend it. "
Nice indoor thermal water park,"It's a great water park. I thought it was going to be very cold during winter. I was wrong. The park was warm and the water was just nice. There's a lot of things to play inside. Slides, tubes and a fake wave pool too. Very clean. There's personnels around the area to assist you after you slide down into the pool.It's just beside the Alpensia Pyeongchang Ski resort. Walking distance to the ski area and Holiday Inn Hotel.There's place for lockers, showers and a shop selling swimwear & gears if you've forgotten to bring yours.My kids enjoyed it so much. Mind you it's during winter some more. Just awesome!"
Over priced and charged,"Facility is fine but over charged . After the main entrance fee , you have to rent a life vest and cap (this is mandatory, regardless your swimming ability ) , and rent a lounge chair if you want to sit on the side to watch your kids. "
Pleasant surprise for kids!,"Stayed at the Intercontinental for 4 nights during the winter months mainly for skiing. This water fun park is a great break from skiing when the kids were a bit tired of skiing. It's not the greatest I've been but quite good with about 5-6 areas with different rides with floats and tires. My favorite was being able to swim outdoors in warm water when it's like -5C outside, almost like the onsens in Japan. We went after day skiing about 5pm and stayed till 8pm which was really plenty of action for kids to exert whatever energy they had after skiing. Slept well that night!! "
Not bad if weather prevents skiing ,"Spent an hour with my year old daughter. Facilty is modern and clean. Difficult to navigate if you do not speak Korean however staff are exceptionally friendly and really try to help. Park is advertised as one of the largest in Korea however actually quite small. Fortunately not that crowded so you can easily have multiple goes on the water slides. Tornado four person rubber ring slide is a must try..my daughter loved it.We spent a fun hour there, however could not imagine spending much longer."
Nice waterpark for family,"Though it is in winter, the waterpark can still give you fun. The water is warm with spa, made you relax and relief. It was also suitable for kids with a few slides. Feeling good when you go outside of the waterpark especially in winter time, so enjoying."
Nice waterpark for kids,"Since it is not crowded, no need to queue up for most of the water rides. Water can be warmer, but overall very good. Changing room is super clean."
Family 2016 Winter break,"Small indoor park with few slides but provided good fun away from the slopes for the children. Its heated, so its nice and warm although its snowing outside.Theres also a korean sauna at the top level where one need to be fully undressed to enter.Theres stalls serving udon, burgers, fried chicken, rice, etc. Enough to keep rumbling tummies happy.Recommend for family with kids if you are visiting Alpensia."
Extra bonus when you stay at Alpensia,"Great indoor waterpark and small part of it is open to air and especially good during winter, discount for hotel guest and please show your room key"
Nice place,It is good for adult but not good for kid who height lower 120cm. Because all faculty is not for kids. The price of ticket is quite high but guest of hotel have 30% discount.
Excellent indoor water park,A big indoor water park with few water slides. An outdoor swimming pool is also connecting to the indoor swim. Quite a few high temp. pool (39 to 40 degrees) for relaxing. Place is clean and not crowded. Highly recommend for take a rest after the skiing! The location is right next to the skiing centre.
Better than the reviews,"We visited here during winter and it made me forget that it was freezing outside, Rode on all the slides which are the main attractions, There were very few people so we took the rides multiple times. There is also a wave pool and lazy river and warm pools with water massages. Do visit if you are staying in alpensia as there is a discount."
Don't forget your swim cap!,"Fun water park, especially interesting in the winter. You'll need to rent a swim cap if you don't bring your own."
Disappointing water rides,"After reading various reviews and knowing we didn't need too many hours there, we went there after our final day of skiing to celebrate the birthday of my younger daughter. We arrived at around 3.30 pm and paid the afternoon rate of KRW 35k plus a discount for Alpensia guests. We quickly got changed and reached the swimming pool area at 3.40. Upon arrival, we were forced to rent life vests for KRW 5k each, regardless of whether we needed them or not. We immediately headed for the water slides area as we had been looking forward to them since reading about the various rides. However, when we reached the area, we found the steps leading to the top of the slides chained up. After a while, the chain to the tornado and body slide steps was removed. We went on the Tornado, which was pretty thrilling and perfect for our family of 4. After that, we each tried the body slide and we all found it terrifying as it was really dark and fast and felt dangerous. We then wanted to try the other rides but found the chain still there. Upon enquiry of the staff, we were told that they closed at 3.40 pm. We then had no choice but to play the tornado ride multiple times. The various hot springs and jacuzzi areas were nice. The wave pool was also good. The shower area was decent but they do not provide any complimentary shampoo or conditioner, just a bar of soap. For shampoo and conditioner, you had to buy little sachets from a vending machine. All in all, for our family, for which the water rides were a key attraction, we felt that with only two workable rides, it was not worth the price we paid, especially when you also add in the cost of the vest. The early closure of the other rides was not mentioned anywhere in their website nor at the cashier when we bought our tickets. A more conscientious water park would have offered additional discount to compensate for this. "
Quite pricy and small,"The indoor water Themepark is not big in scale, and pricy. There's a nice outdoor jucuzzi which provides a nice experience during winter, and a wave pool that kids will love."
Expensive and restrictive,Didnt enjoy the fact the attractions had som many rules and we had to wear a cap and life jacket the whole time. Not worth the price of admission
Lacking,We visited during winter 2015. Two rides were close just because it was a weekday. The entry fees to the water park is not cheap and luckily we had a 35% discount coupon. The whole place is cold and some of the pool is not warm enough. There isn't really much to do and we were glad we didn't pay for the whole day. The foodcourt is air conditioned and it doesn't make sense because its already so cold and there's no way I'd wanna step in to get some munch and freeze myself to death in my wet swimsuit. My 4year old can't do much for rides isn't her age appropiate and all we could do is float around the lazy river. The water playground is cold.
Nice,"My first visit to a waterpark as was my wife and 2 kids too.Therefore, I can't compare but had more than enough to keep kids happy and excited.I dropped my glasses and lifeguards were nice enough to switch off the water to find it for me.Wish the food stalls were open even on weekdays."
Average ~,I went there is winter . So the outdoor pools are closed. The indoor water park is not very big. Recommend to spend 2hours in the park. The highest water slides in the park is GREAT !!! I played 3times !!
Good for families group,"Very large, clean and confortable place! Price acceptable and it is very good for families to stay there with theirs childrens!"
Not much to do for kids under 6,There wasn't much snow on the slopes so we decided to check out the water park. Unfortunately our kids are both under 1.2m so there wasn't much for them. 
Relaxing after skiing,"If skiing / staying in alpensia, you are entitled to a discount on entry. As I visited here during the snow season, the outdoor pools weren't openThe jacuzzi pools were good for adults to relax whilst kids can go play in the wave pool/ lazy river / slides. You have the option to get massages here as well. The massage is conducted in a cabana style tent next to the wave poolIf you have forgotten your swimmers you can rent/buy swimmers for a reasonable price.There is also a 'sauna' level that is gender separated. When I had a quick peak at that mens area, it looked like a bath house where you have to go without swimmers."
Nice after a day on the slopes,After spending a day on the slopes a dip in a Jacuzzi or a slide down one of the waterslides is exactly what my boys had in mind. They enjoyed their evening spent inside the waterpark. It was a little smaller than we are use to but still very nice. Mommy and Daddy enjoyed it being inside where we could sit in the hot tubs or jet pools and watch our kids go up and down all the slides or float around in the lazy river. All in All a nice time spent
Small but relaxing,Good place to relax after full day skiing. Heated indoor pools. Two small hot springs. Outdoor heated pool was good esp when you go during snowing season. Interesting experience. 
Nice Water Spa,Good place to go when weather is bad. Tried the indoor rides. Tornado pool was fast and furious - be careful of your neck! Outdoor pool was a fantastic experience. Water spa was exhilarating and soothing to different parts of the body. Well worth the entrance ticket.
A trip with my loved ones ,"I went on 8th Dec with my family members. This is something that I had never try before in Singapore. My hubby misplaced his spectacles in the floating area. We informed the life guard and he was very sweet to swim and search for my hubby's spec. Thank you so much!! But be prepared that you need to rent the cap and life vest.I would encourage you to bring you swimming caps if you are interested in going there with your family and bring your towels too. Their towels are quite small and if you need their sun towels which are bigger, you have to rent them I put my white towel on the chair and went to play the slides. When I came back, my towel was lost. I went to inform but the guy who was in charge of the life vests was not able to understand what I said. The reason why I asked him as the towel placed on the chair was positioned in front of the life vest counter. But I did not pursue it .Overall, I would say that my child loves the wave and the jacuzzis. "
Fun park,"There were 4 slides in the park, and 3 of them were in operation at the time of visit. It was great having a warm pool in the winter. Wave pool was also fun (a lot better than the one at Galaxy, Macau - at least these were really ""waves""). Though it was fun in the water park, the admission tickets were kind of pricey, and it is compulsory that you wear a life jacket (in some facilities) and water caps, which you would need to pay extra if you did not have those with you."
Fun water park,"It's compulsory for swimmers to wear life jacket and swimming cap, if you don't have one you can rent there. They also offer swimming suits for rent. It was winter when I visited the park so I stayed indoors only. What impressed me the most are the slides - really exciting, and the jacuzzi which could massage different parts of your body. The rest of the facilities are mainly for kids I guess.The changing room & sauna impressed me too. The place is very clean and orderly so you don't have to worry about slippery floor or messy changing room. As part of the Korean tradition, you shower with others in the bath room before you enter the sauna - 2 pools of different temperatures indoors and 1 outdoor, as well as a wet and a dry sauna. There is a swimming suit drying machine which I found amazing. The sauna is an extra to me as I could truly relax. "
White winter and warm summer in one,"Loved the warm pool with water jets and in built ""beds"" for water lounging. We braved the snowy winter cold to walk to the outside part of the pool - freezing but warm.The sauna part was just so relaxing with japanese like bath. "
Nice but a bit outdated.,"Not much to rave about because a life vest to wear in the wave pool need to pay extra for.A few play slides to try.We tried the jacuzzi indoorand outdoors.Some are working fine, others either not working or partially works. Water jets on the left or right side not functioning."
Fun but have some drawbacks,"Really had fun in there but if you are muslims, please be prepared to keep your eyes in d changing room. They are all naked.. and in d shower room, they provide soap instead of liquid soap. So just imagine sharing it with someone else!! I love d outdoor pool but it is too small when everybody was waiting to use d jakuzi.."
Good fun,Good fun with all the slides inside. It’s a 10 minutes walk from hotel intercontinental. You need to wear swimming cap and life jacket if you intend to use the wave pool and the lazy river. Bad taste to charge additional 1000 won and 5000 won for life jacket including children afterall the entrance fee(entrance fee 45000 won and 35000 for child less 35% for hotel guests ) is not cheap.Closed 8pm on weekend and 6pm on weekdays. Entrance fee after 2pm for weekdays was slightly cheaper than the morning. Upon leaving I estimate about 100 students enter the pool. This resort is popular with locals which I suggest avoid coming here on weekend.
Water Fun in Near Zero degrees,Normally unthinkable to swim in this weather (specially for a person who lives near the equator) but this was pleasant surprise.This one is too much fun to pass on if you're in the area. This was actually a back up activity to skiing which was delayed due to bad weather.We were fortunate to be here with no crowds. So no lines.
Relaxing water park,"This is one indoor water park that suites all families members... Regardless of age. There are activities to entertain even the most senior. Water level, cleanliness, hygiene is tip top. Love the sauna and naked hot bath. "
Fun getting wet here,"This is an indoor water theme park that is rather nice, even for someone who doesn't swim like me. It is more suitable for family, but nonetheless, the facilities are nice.The place is a warm respite from cold weather outside, and rather spacious. I enjoyed the colorful waterslide and rode on that a few times. The place is well-kept and maintains a high level of cleanliness, which is important for patrons.For more detailed information, please feel free to visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2013/12/kaptivating-korea.html"
Family fun day.,"Reasonably nice. The children shud love it, as wz adults. Good place for family to hv fun. Best part abt this place??? ... iy jas definitely got to be the outdoor pool in winter!!!. Warm temp-controlled water is in winter ... refreshing! ... & rivitalising!!."
Too commercialized and nothing exciting,"The place only offered an average experience. Nothing much inside the park. And one cannot use the incline bench without paying a fees, which is too commercialize. Everything need to rent once inside the venue, including the compulsory life vest."
Nice indoor water play,We liked that it provides a warm haven from the cold winter outside. The place and facilities were clean. The water play and rides were quite standard but nevertheless kept the children busy for a day. It was nice to be in swim suits after having to endure cold winter winds and layers of winter clothing!
You Could Easily Spend A Day There,"Lots to do for a 7 years old; more than enough rides to keep my son happy. It indoor pool was extended to outdoor pool which water was warm enough for December. Lots of jets to massage one muscles after a day on the ski slopes. The food court wasn't that good but good enough for a quick lunch.There is Dunkin Donuts and coffee, fried chickens to satisfy us though. The only thing i really don't like is the changing rooms; strange layout; one has to go get a shower in an open shower area then you are expected to go naked and walk all the way to another level to get dressed; strange. Your shoes/boots would be in yet another level locked up; just strange and it doesn't wok for me. I also do not like what i saw in the changing room. You need to bring your own shampoo and stuff or you could buy them from its vending machine...strange changing room but we had a fun day in the water park."
water fun for all ages,"This water theme park has all the facilities and amenities of for all its users.The children are treated with the best water wave pool, dark water channels, heat pools etc. The man and woman can enjoy their water fun with only the Birthday suit at the 3rd level, away from the kids. The whole family can make use of all types of water pools,if you like pressure sprays there are plenty around including one outside (open air)This water resort has a complicated system of lockers and keys to store you belongings before you are allowed into the fun areas. Facilities are well provided such as rental of floats, caps, swimsuit etc."
Steamingly good,"In the midst of the snow hills & ski resorts, the outdoor steaming baths were excellent. Much thought was put into designing this water theme park especially with the hygiene facilities. A great place to take a break from all that skiing. "
nice place but can improve,"the water was heated(relief from the cold outside),they make you rent the safety harness(worth it),once you have finished, there is a clothes dryer and a café inside. However, what the cons are is that you have to carry a key which makes you access your lockers and if the water washes it away, it is a danger. What I can suggest is it can be something like a watch. Also in the shower area there are no doors so prepare to be naked in front of someone you don't know."
Alpensia Atraction,"Ocean 700 "" 5 min walk from the Intercontinental Hotel, is like a water park, good for families (specially if you want to give your kids a break from the cold and the snow... if that is possible) , you have a wave pool, jacuzzi, pools with games...etc you can stay and eat there. For Intercontinental guest you get 35% (3 times a day 10AM -8pm/2-8Pm/ or 5-8pm with each time slot price is cheaper) "
Good but cold,"Staying at Alpensia resort we went once to Ocean 700, was good, but cold. We must admit that we live in Thailand and the water was fresh for us even in the middle of Feb. Interesting attractions were closed to child below 120 cm."
Good for 2-3 hours in the morning.,"Go early and you'll have the place to yourself, but the waterslides dont open until 12:30pm - WEAKThey make you wear (rent) swim caps and life jackets - WEAKSmall wave pool is fun. Waterslides are fun. Outdoor hot pool area is nice in the winter. Not much food on offer, but they had a Dunkin Donuts!!!"
Good fun!,This is great place for a few hours of fun with lots of rides and wavepools. The whole family enjoyed it and the facilities are clean and good quality. The place is not cheap though. 
Great fun for the whole family,"Great fun for everyone. The only disappointment was that our 3 year old wasn't tall enough for the water slide rides, however, he had a great time on the river run. The facilities are very good and there are even swimming costumes for rent (which was good for me as I had forgotten to bring mine). Beware, you will need to wear a swim hat and if you want to go in the wave pool and river ride you will need a life jacket REGARDLESS of how good a swimmer you are. But don't worry, it is all very good fun."
