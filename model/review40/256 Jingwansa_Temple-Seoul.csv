Must visit ,"I wanted to visit a temple before the sunset, and Jingwansa was my first choice since it is located inside Seoul and in one of its most famous neighborhood, although it was hard to find, I spent around an hour walking around the area before finding it, but it was worth it! It was worth every minute I spent looking for it!There was kind of festival back then and I understood nothing about it, all papers and prayers were written in Korean, but the area was FULL with flowers and it was one of the most enchanting places I ever visited, with these believers and monks and tourists.I was lucky to see this temple in morning and to witness the sunset there, both scenes were remarkable.Absolutely will visit it again."
Breathtaking ,Absolutely beautiful. It was neat to see all the colorful lanterns. The temple had three large golden Buddha's. great place for cultural emersion. 
Within Seoul in the foothills of Bukhan mountain,"Apparently only female monks are permitted to reside here.The grounds are expansive and surrounded by gorgeous Korean pine trees. All areas are immaculately tidy and clean. Views of Bukhan mountain abound. There is also a temple stay (not tested), and a small tea shop under a thatched roof. All very quaint and pleasant. Technically within the city limits of Seoul and only 30-45 minutes by ground transport from the centre, it's a lovely half day out. Highly recommended. "
Peace in mind,"It is the first time I have experienced the temple stay, and definitely, I really enjoyed every moment in Jingwansa.The senior Nun taught us many lessons which brought peace and calm in my mind. Despite the complicated life outside, all lessons cooled down my burning head.Even I had to sleep at 9:30PM and wake up at 4PM, but I felt so fresh. Then, I felt the peace in mind after 108 prostrations.The food is very very delicious, which is much more different from I expected."
"Peaceful, amazing visit.",I went to this Buddist temple not knowing what to expect. Beautifully set in an amazing natural spot it helps one find peace immediately. The different temples with the monks chanting is mesmerizing. It's a bit difficult to know the expectations of how to behave but it turned out fine. Nice cafe with the most friendly people ever. Loved it and want to come back for temple stay.
Super beautiful natural place to walk,"I went to this temple for a templestay, the only thing is that I wish we would have had time to walk around and explore the beautiful nature that is all around. It looked like such a wonderful place to climb the mountain from. So peaceful. Si beautiful. And so painfully far from centertown... It took me a couple of subways and a bus to get there. It was tiring."
