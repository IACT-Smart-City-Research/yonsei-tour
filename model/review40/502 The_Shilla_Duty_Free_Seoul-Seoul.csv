Unpleasant experience,"On my return from Seoul, l wanted to get a bottle of Lancome perfume for my relative.After my check in at Terminal one of Incheon International Airport, l went to The Shilla duty free shop.It was about 1430 hours and the shop was rather crowded I got the perfume and went to the counter to pay by US dollars.At paying, the female staff started to put the item into a plastic bag and wanted to seal it. I immediately told her to remove the price tag as it was a gift .She just ignored me and continued with the wrapping and chatting with her colleague. I had to tell her again and finally her fellow colleague next to her explained my concern and request. Perhaps, she was not proficient in English, but that didn't mean she could just ignore customers. It was a very unpleasant experience . "
Services is very bad,"It’s is crowded due to tourism and the customer service is really bad , especially a male salesman which sell masks at jmsolution counter is very rude."
Don’t waste your time or your money,Went in search of some much needed European cosmetics to replace ones used while long term travelling. Outrageous prices for European brands. Can’t even take the purchases away with you. Have to collect at airport as exit Korea. Don’t waste your time or money here. Buy at airport. Cheaper and much better shopping experience.
so rude,"We came to SDF at NoV 2nd 2018. When my friend buy products at HERA's counter, i came to Sulwasoo's. and i saw the products that my mom need it. So i take a pic. suddenly one of the salesgirl come to me, and said with rude face and ask me to delete and she wait for it until i delete the pic. Since when we can no pic at the counter? Even at next counter we can make pics and send to my relatives. i didn't understand why now a lot of salesgirl in many shop in seoul are rude.One year ago i came to seoul and they still nice. so different now. Really not recomended for a city who expect from tourists.Even when we go shoping at Myeongdong/ Gangnam and other locations many of rude sales girls there.No Smile."
Too many chinese,"The selection is good and the service is friendly. But there are far too many Chinese tourists there. For the skincare, other stores probably would have them cheaper. "
Good selection of goods,"This is probably the best duty free shop in Seoul with great variety of goods. short walk from Dongguk-Univ Station and not too far from Dongdaemun / Itaewon, it's worth the trip especially if you're looking for local cosmetics to luxury goods."
Meh,"Great place if you are looking to buy brand names. The good are purchased but you don't pick up until departure date...so it could be quite a hassle if you've already packed all your luggage. I saw many people refitting their luggages at the airport. We don't usually buy much during vacations so most of the things that we ended up buying at Shilla can be found at the airport duty free. The prices were the same. However, if you plan on buying brand names like LV, Gucci, Chanel, etc...this is the place. Shuttle bus every 30 minutes to Myeongdong so that was a plus."
Full of people ,Went to Shilla to buy souvenirs for parents and it was packed full of people! A good place if you’re into shopping but definitely not recommended if you don’t enjoy a crowd. 
Love Seoul ,It’s good to shopping here I got my Alexander MQueen backpack here and alit skincare and more thing !! Very good price too and you pick up from the airport before you boarding !! This trip was last year but I will be back in Seoul next week and will stop by shop for more ! Right now I am here in beautiful Jeju Island and The Shilla Duty free shop near by my hotel too !! We will go there tomorrow to shop !! Love their service 
Web site,Their web site is not working so this is not a good sign for a business.Will look else where.Not a review but I was just looking for information before paying a visit.
Satisfied shopping,"I regreted a bit of money causeI bought too many products like cosmetics and stuff. But I got cash vouchers via Visit Korea Mastercard. Thanks to that, I could get discount of 30000won. It was grateful."
"if you like duty free shops, this is what you will like",It's a bit crowded.But bigger than donghwa duty free shopMy mother was happy there.almost everything is hereShopping place recommended to Mandarin speakers.Tip! I got a discounted on Mastercard!it's good tip for you:)
Expensive n not customer driven,Went to this store to get alcohol made in South korea as I usually do I any new place in visiting but it was like pulling tooth.. the workers were not very helpful and didn't speak English so got ignored a bit because they cant speak English.The alcohol I found were but pricey esp the one with the ginseng root in it. However there was s wide variety of items made in korea at this shop to choose from.
"Duty free store at The Shilla, Seoul......","The Shilla Duty Free Seoul is a duty free department store in the grounds of The Shilla Hotel. Goods on offer are mainly fashion and cosmetics related, with a very small electronics and gift area in the basement. There is a rooftop café to break up your visit, but to be honest, the store is aimed mainly at Chinese tourists as the prices aren't attractive to us Westerners given most of the brands are imported. Worth a wander if you are stopping at the Shilla and a little bored, but otherwise little point in making a special trip to pay a visit. Better to catch a cab to Myeongdong !"
Withdrawn 2 times,"I recently bought at Seoul Duty Free, but when I come back home I notice on my bank account that I was withdrawn 2 times.. thank you"
Waste of time,"Staff are rude and unwilling to serve. Bought an item and was only told after payment that you have to collect the item at airport. There are many counters for collection at the airport. They do not tell you which counter to collect from and was sent all over airport, from one counter to another. Finally managed to pickup my item after heading to three collection point."
Duty free shop,"Bigger than donghwa duty free shopSo for foreigner dont forget to bring passport, all goods sold in usd price"
I don't recommend it ,"Franking speaking I don't recommend this place .It is full of people, mainly from china, and even they said that are more than 500 brands at the end it is like a street market but inside of a building on the basement floor I was less than 45 min and I was frustrating for that bad experience "
Not meant for the English Speaking Tourists,"But the store still has lots of shops and decent prices. Went with my wife, wife's cousin and his gf. They all spoke Mandarin. My cousin was happy there. It is loud, crowded and a bit unruly. I think they get most of the customers from the adjacent hotel or tour groups. So if you are not on a tour or staying at the Shilla hotel next door, maybe stick to the duty free parts of Lotte or Shinsegae. Bring your passport if you plan to purchase anything as you will need to pick your items up at the airport."
Crowded Place Packed With Mainland Chinese Tourists,"If you can't converse in Mandarin or Korean, please avoid this place as all the staff can't speak English. It is crowded and very noisy and I don't feel comfortable here. A lot of branded merchandise and cosmetics are sold here. We were part of a tour group and this was one of places on the itinerary. I will not patronize this shop again."
one stop shopping place,"almost everything is here. but it gets crowded because herds of tourists are brought here in tour buses. just go real early or later in the day, like almost closing time to avoid the crowds."
Shopping place not recommended to English speakers,"It's like any duty free in Seoul, but what was frustrating is that the workers only spoke Korean or Chinese. None spoke English and that made it hard to purchase things. Don't forget to take you passport and e ticket since you pick up your items in the airport."
Can be crowded so if possible make a list before going there ,"Arrived late afternoon. Full of tourists. Most service attendants speak Mandarin. A few speak smattering English and only one I met spoke pretty good English. Nonetheless if you know what you want, easy to communicate. Korean brands are given to you right away. International brands have to be collected at the airport. Look around the normal malls first to see what you want. Make a list so you can go in and out fast. "
Crowded,"This is a must stop by place if you always needed more time in Duty Free but was rushed by the time. However, Shilla Duty Free is almost always overflowing with tourists. You'll have to wait in a queue until to can go into certain stores, and even you do go in it is difficult to get served right away.Generally all the staff there are friendly and willing to serve you but it'a just they have too many customers to deal with."
Crowded with Chinese tourists,"The prices here are better than at Lotte Duty Free and at Myeondong! They have all the skincare brands as well as the luxury brands like Tory Burch, LV, Hermes, Prada etc. that is why you will see bus loads of Chinese tourists here. There is also a free shuttle from Stilla to Myeondong, so it is very convenient."
Rude Poor Service Towards Japanses Customers,"In all the 30 years of being in customer service, I have never witnessed such poor and rude customer service - towards only Japanese customers! Was it racial? probably 'Yes"""
Hard to Get to Crowded Store,"This store is up a large hill. It's fine if you're on one of those tour busses but along with the construction near by, it made it tough to walk up to the store.And talking about tour busses, there were so many. We went on a weekday in the early afternoon. The place was packed full of mainland Chinese and Japanese tourists. The crowdedness combined with the electricity curtailed lack of air conditioning made the experience poor at best.The brands are all luxury goods except for some food stuffs for purchase and a small electronics counter.The store is also surprisingly small with cramped paths and low ceilings. We had way more fun at the COEX Lotte Duty Free store."
It's a duty free shop,"if you like duty free shops, this is what you will like. It's not cheap, it' has mildly interesting archtitecture and it is beside the Shilla hotel.Anyone who voted for a duty free shop as bering a great attraction wants to get out more and see the real sights."
