Great History Museum,"Loved the cultural museum. They had lots of shows, art exhibits and live presentation on how to make crafts, food, and ceremonial wedding ceremony. There is a great rope walking show, boys dance, and horse show. Loved the old buildings, nature and little shops. There is a kiddie land for families with young children."
