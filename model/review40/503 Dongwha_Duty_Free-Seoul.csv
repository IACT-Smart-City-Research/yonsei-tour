Was just happy to see Gong Yoo('s photo),"Good selection of brands. The staff are bored to see you, and they don't hide it. Good for shopping if your hotel is nearby."
SHOPPING AT BETTER PLACE THAN DONGDAEMUN,I Think This Place Is Better Than Doota at DongdaemunThe promotion much more here than Doota.Next time I will came back here
Survey on Product Promo,"The most exclusive stores of branded items, be on consumer item and most categorical buying pattern which is considered as impulse buyer behavior will do the transaction. Only targeted consumer with the uncategorized spending pattern will purchase.... "

Tudor EtcIf you want to buy Korean Merk you must pay and product you will packing in here. If Out Korean Merk you pay and the product ini bandara 
Shortest line at the airport pick up area,"This store was a compulsory stop in the tour package, so we were not thrilled to complete the hour and a half shopping. Nevertheless, the place was classy with many of the luxurious brands found at the airport. The men in our group didn't move beyond the chocolate store, and we ladies spent most of the minutes in cosmetics. Price wise, couldn't compare with airport as there was no stock. Drawback is: goods bought here (non-Korean brands) could only be picked up at the airport (upper floor). There, you need to get a queue number and wait. We only bought from 2 brands so leaving was quick. We did see other passengers from other duty free stores who got several items and needed to strategize packing in their handcarry. Looking back, if stock availability and price are the same, shopping at the airport instead would have been a better idea."
"Good duty free, especially for Korean cosmetics","Huge store with all the brands. 5th and 3rd floors carry a huge array of top Korean cosmetics. From what I could tell, prices in local products are ok, but imported things are expensive. Good place to visit if you need some beauty products."
Good place for shopping,A lot of shops for shopping. Good price and you can find a lot of cosmetic here. A lot of street food as well. 
Duty free shop,"Duty free shop for foreigner, almost brand available in here, just dont forget bring your pasport, and almost in usd price"
a lot of spenders...many brands around,pity that the tour program only dropped us here for only 45 minutes...have to rush around running around buying things we want..MCM bag available here as well and during time of visit it offers very good deal!
All under one roof and suitable for lady shopaholics!,"A duty free store (DFS) that spans over 6th storeys (excluding the basement where high end boutiques and branded stores and the information counter is located), it has almost everything under one roof that lady shopaholics do not want to miss!Cosmetics, Fashion, Shoes, Bags, Watches, Toys, IT, Electrical and Electronic gadgets, Foodstuff and also Ginseng health products etc all could be found here.We were here as the last stop of our full day city tour and it was already past 5.00pm and the store was not surprisingly, with shoppers (mostly from China) who like ""nobody business"" bought tens of bags of items.Not sure about the prices but there are items (that we were familiar with) selling higher and lower than elsewhere. For example, the Ginseng healthy products were cheaper here than other places that we have came across while the Seaweed were more expensive here. (sorry we were not into cosmetic or branded goods so more than 60% of the things here were not relevant to us)Generally staff were friendly here and could speak in various languages and so there is no language barrier (though some of them were a bit pushy to do a sales with walk past customers). A good thing is that they have several resting area all around the store to let shoppers ""relax and rest"" from their shopping spree!If you are into shopping for lifestyle or beauty products here, you will need more time and make sure you request from the information counter (if you are not with with your tour guide) for special/additional discount vouchers. And you will need to have your passport for verification purpose."
Busiest Duty Free in Town ,"Strategically located near Sejong Street, Dongwha is always busy and crowded. Especially by tourists from Asia. Mostly visitors looking for cosmetics on the top floor. But they also have various branded and lux goods like bags and watches."
Best place for shopping,This duty free is in downtown opposite the Cheongkaechon canel. Not a very big shopping mall but has everything. The promotion of cosmetic here is better than in Myeongdong.
Not a place to shop if you have time constraints,"Arrived back to Seoul from a bus trip. Because buses stop here to drop off passengers, I decided to purchase something I wanted from Korea before going home.I am in a group and everyone is tired so I had five minutes to get the item.It is an extreme hassle with requiring a boarding ticket along with your passport.Let's see... I bought my ticket from Expedia. Explain how I can produce a ticket, which leaves in two days. Then their wifi is snail slow. They want me to go through hundreds of email to produce the Expedia ticket. Alternatively, they wanted me to tell them the time and flight number I am leaving on. I don't know of many people who have memorized their flight numbers.Wish there was a manager to deal with this.They need a better way of handling this in a timely manner. In the end, they lost my business because my group wanted to go."
Finished this building visit in 10minutes,If you look for a perfume you might stay in this building a bit longer. Everything here is a bit expensive than the other store because its duty free but...it still expensive..last 2 years I came here bought perfumes but this year I bought nothing because my wife preferred Rozita Che Wan perfumes..lol.
Not really cheap,Some of the things here are not really cheap... To those bought a thing which the brand is not from korea you will take your thing at the airport when your will going back to your next destination and if you buy a korean brand you can bring back underspot. If you buy a thing here you should show your pasport and boarding ticket. 
Okay duty shopping in Seoul,"Dongwha is centrally located in downtown Seoul and popular with tour groups. The basement is entirely devoted to premium brand names from Europe and elsewhere, the ground floor for watches and casual bags, a floor of foreign cosmetics and another for Korean products. Frankly, I would have liked more of the Korean products, and was disappointed to find a limited selection of foodstuffs. I suppose the margin is low and you can find them in quantity at supermarkets like the one in Lotte Department Store.Dongwha is good if you have a specific idea of what duty free product you want. Other than that, it can be a pleasant escape for an hour or two and as a base to visit Cheonggyecheon , the coffee shops and fast food joints nearby."
the cheapest duty free in seoul,They have many brands from around the world.. and the price more cheaper than the others.. for korean brands you can bring directly.. around the building they have many coffe shopnif you waiting your family or friends shopping in there..
