Highly recommend the temple stay,"We had the opportunity to stay here as part of the temple stay program. This is a beautiful temple. Facilities were awesome (heated floors, en-suite bathrooms and shower). I also really enjoyed the vegetarian food and taking part in the prayers with the monks. A perfect place to unwind and relax. Temple stay staff went out of their way to make us feel comfortable. It was also great having access to this temple away from tourist hours and jostling with the crowds. A must do experience!"
"One of many Korean temples. Not bad, not so good.","You may choose a temple stay here after hiking the Jirisan. Or you may visit it on the way back to your lodging place from the Nogodan of Jirisan.Whatever, it's a good choice to visit. Peaceful and spacious. A typical Korean budhist temple."
Beautiful and quiet temple,"CY+c (18.04.14 ) There was not bigger than I guess, but there was good mood and view. Always the temple give me composure, and made me calm. The view was very good, and the atmosphere was good, too. We spend much time in there, and enjoyed view, smell and atmosphere. Good temple."

plenty of things to admire,"this temple in the foothills of Chirisan is well worth a visit for its treasures. These include the famous lion statue but also the hall with its three stories from the 18th century. These wooden structures rarely survive and always take my breath away.The hike up to the Baekdudaegan ridge is very steep, but there are other nice hikes to hermitages. At the entrance area is the Chirisan bear centre, which also looks interesting."
"Beautiful temple, worth a visit",I visited this temple in conjuction with a stop in Gurye for a triathlon. Hwaeomsa temple has beautiful grounds and temple structures. It's a well kept and educational glimpse into Korean culture. Highly recommended if you are in the area with an hour to spare.
Simply Beautiful,"As part of our trip to Jirisan, and exploration of the Piagol valley later, this was a great way to spend the afternoon. It is certainly one of the best temples we have visited in Korea as the wooden structures gave it a real earthly feel, very calming and I guess basic in some ways. Many other temples often have bright colours but this one retains the original bare wood. The whole atmosphere is sublime and as we went in autumn the colours were wonderful as the setting is surrounded by wooded mountains."
Serene Temple in Mount Jiri,"Hwaeomsa Temple is one of the best in Korea. The location is exquisite, nestled in a beautiful valley in Jirisan National Park. The historic pagodas are from the Silla dynasty. Much of the wooden buildings we see today date back to the restoration of the temple between 1699-1702. The temple is littered with National Treasures, including the largest stone lantern on the Korean Peninsula. During my visit in early June, the mountain was a vivid green and the air was fresh. Hwaeomsa in my view is a hidden gem, much along the same lines as Beopjusa Temple. Too often I hear how Korean temples are all the same. You will eat your words if you visit Hwaeomsa, Beopjusa, Haeinsa, Unjusa, Tongdosa, and Bulguksa. These six temples are exceptional and are a testament to the traditions of Korean Buddhism."
Beautiful temple in the mountains,"I visited the Hwaeomsa temple over the Buddha's birthday holiday and was wowed by the location. In late spring, the mountains are lush and bright green with foliage, and the temple itself is beautiful. It's a long way from Seoul, anywhere from 4-6 hours by bus depending on traffic, but well worth it. The Jirisan mountain area is stunning and the air quality much better than the big city.If you're brave you can opt for the temple stay option, experiencing the ascetic lifestyle of Buddhist monks. As temples go, this one is actually rather well-appointed, with electricity and hot showers. You will need to get comfortable with sleeping on the floor and eating three meals a day of vegetarian bibimbap, though. Waking up at 3AM to watch the Buddhist monks pray is a disorienting but unique experience.Otherwise, just go for the view and the relaxing hiking opportunities in the area. You won't be disappointed."
