Expensive Street Food,"Bad choice to eat along this street because the food is expensive.The menu doesn’t have any price listed. (Warning) I ordered a dish of pork and Squid and it cost me ₩68,000.Food is so-so.The atmosphere was okay though."
Scam,"44,000 won for one squid dish (more of a snack than a dish) and one soju. As others have said, this snack was more expensive than any meal we’d ever had in Korea. Seems like a scam."
WARNING to ALL visitors - AVOID this DANGEROUS and POTENTIALLY VIOLENT SCAM,"We are seasoned and experienced travellers - and this is one of the most gauling scams we've seen. On the road south of Lotte Department Store are several of the infamous food tents. They were not overly busy and we went to one staffed by a seemingly lovely lady. The menu was only in Korean, with no numerals on the menu associated with any of the pictures. Time spent in China and Cambodia had disarmed us from being concerned at this red flag. The three of us had already had dinner - we wanted a snack and some beers and to soak up the atmosphere. We had 8 BBQ'd king prawns (these were quite good), 4 small chicken kebabs that were dreadful and 2 local beers (that cost about 3000 won in the shop). We ate up and were handed a bill for 50,000 won (£33/$42) - more than any single meal we ate in Seoul! A young man had joined the serving lady during the cooking and on hindsight its clear he was there as an enforcer - we argued the bill vociferously, offering 60% (which would still be a rip-off), offering to involve the police and finally walking off. We had attempted negotiation using Google Translate, attempting to explain our position. They became very aggressive, very quickly, in a manner atypical for Koreans, and eventually chased one of our number down the street, using fellow stall-owners to coerce the remaining money. Please be careful - these are seasoned pro's at ripping off people, and they are the antithesis of everything Korean culture stands for. I have flagged up warnings with Lonely Planet and the VisitKorea Tourist Center. Please heed and don't let them spoil an otherwise wonderful country."
Simple Food Street but tasty,"Thanks to Tripadvisor, I didn't tried those tents that selling BBQ pork. Ending up trying those tent which selling fish cake, tteok-bokki and etc. There are few stores selling the same food just parked right outside Lotte Departmental Store. Food is tasty and the price is OK. Recommend to try when you stay somewhere nearby."
Food Alley in Seomyeon area!,Ended up eating my meals here several times during my three day stay in Busan. There are so many eatery choices so it is a bit overwhelming. Definitely highest concentration of restaurants and night life entertainment in Busan city.
Great options for lunch and dinner,"We visited a couple of restaurants in Seomyeon Food Alley - once for lunch and once for dinner. It's great to have some many good options close together! Some places don't have English signage, but if you go in there will probably be an English menu that you can use if needed. We were always given an English menu without having to ask, making it really easy to eat at whatever restaurant you like."
Rip off: $30 for pork+pancake,"Don't go to any red tent where the price is not visible. I ate some fried pork and a pancake at one and then the owner tried to charge me 30,000 won for it = $30!! We argued for 15 minutes, she became extremely aggressive and eventually I walked off with her holding my 20,000 won. Much better to go to a restaurant or eat at the stand-up food stalls where there are clear prices. "
Awesome Vibe with festive streets & Many Cute Cafes,"It was my first time in Seomyeon street & I definitely loved it. There were many people but it wasn't uncomfortable to roam around. The cafes with different themes are all over the streets and the vibe of the streets were sort of a combination of hip Hongdae & serene Yeonnamdong. I think from now on whenever I visit Busan, I'll definitely make Seomyeon street my go-to place to hang out with my friends."
Good place esp for the youngster! ,"From seomyeon street exit 1 and 2, you will find lot of cafe with unique theme and decorations. Most of them even open until midnight. I went there while they are having a festival and i love the atmosphere super nice! "
It's good,"This road is full of nice theme coffee shops. I came here on weekend and there was a small festival there so there were many stalls on the street that sell tasty cake, good coffee, handmade accessories, .... I choosed Dala 100% chocolate cz I love chocolate. It's was good with mashmallow hot chocolate in this windy weather :) Check out Seomyeon cafe street to relax ;) "
Not limited to one street,Basically this whole place is food central with food stalls along the streets and restaurants and cafes on both sides. Watch out for traffic as you meander around the area as the road are still accessed by motor vehicles. 
"Excellent food alley, lots of good street food for cheap eats. So good.","So the first thing you learn in Korea is that the best and affordable restaurants that all the locals go to are in the alley ways between buildings. I call them food alleys. However, once in a while you come across a big street food district and the one in Seomyeon is pretty good. We ate dinner here one night, standing outside a stand you see in the pictures... where every stick was 50cents. or 500won. We ate for nearly 20 minutes and bought a bottle of makkoli, between two of us it was less than 8000won. So good! Lots of good odang, dukboki, tempura, and seafood to be found. There are also sit in restaurants, everyone wants your business here. Highly recommend a stop by the street food alley and the Jalgachi fish market for the brave culinary stomachs. Affordable and delicious. "
Must see ,Very good area with plenty of little restaurants and food carts. Cash needed and mainly Korean food. 
Scam,The food in the red street stalls is a tourist scam. Don't eat anywhere that doesn't have an English menu because they will come up with a random price to charge. Food was also very low quality. Avoid at all costs. Walk-up snack carts are fine though if the price is clearly visible.
So much to choose and eat,"Best to go after 5pm. That's when the stalls come out. No doubt there are many stalls offering the same foods, but u get to see the difference in presentation and the friendliness of the seller."
Pricey fare,"Bunch of food carts selling pretty much the same things - oden/fish cakes on sticks, grilled seafood or meats. Most diners were drinking more than eating - soju being the hot favourite.Since we weren't a drinking bunch, we ate in a proper restaurant, getting better value for our wons."
Our favorite nighttime haunt,"The area has a lot of food stalls, restaurants, and bars to choose from! It's a great place to people watch, especially because of the vibrant drinking culture in South Korea."
Food Alley,Great location in Seomyeon. Different types of food. Some at better prices than other ones. Some shopping around as well
restaurants galore here for the youngsters,lots of hip fashionable restaurants herethere are also some street foodscrowded area kinda like myeongdong in seoul
Eat smartly,"So on one hand the food is yummy andThe stool hosts were welcoming. On the other hand, same food in Seoul markets cost half price.So why eat on the street when underneath lotte mall there is high scale food on the same price. "
Quite expensive street food,Yummy but a little bit expensive...because you will pick a lot of foods than you not sure the price. Better eat in the restaurant bigger portion... 
Not different from other street food areas,"Not saying the food is bad, but it is no different from street food you will get anywhere else in Busan, or, indeed, Korea as a whole."
