Mystique View of the Silver Grass,"The name ‘Ganwolsan’ means a sacred mountain like ‘Sinbulsan.’ As high as 1,069 m, it has steep rocky cliffs on the east and highlands with gentle slopes on the west. In early August, the mountain lily blooms and creates a mystique view in harmony with the short silver grass around the peak.Ganwolsan is a favorite place for many hikers to watch the silver grass in autumn. The wide silver grass plains in the altitude of more than 1000m offer special points of interest, unlike other mountains.In the fall of the Yeongnam Alps, where the silver grass makes their appearance in the autumn, the Ulju Odyssey, the mountain concert, the mountain marathon, and the mountain climbing tournament are held every year."
Beautiful view of mountain in Fall,I would recommend to hike the Sinbul mountain and Ganwol Mountain from the Youngnam Alps Complex Center.You can also see beautiful eulalia yard.
