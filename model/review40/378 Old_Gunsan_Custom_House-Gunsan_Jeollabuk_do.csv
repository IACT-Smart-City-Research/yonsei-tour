Colorful,Fairly colorful at end of the street next to customs. Building was closed but you can stamp a card at end of the building.
Go to the side door,"This building is a relic of the Japanese colonial administration. It has a handsome facade that lends itself nicely to group pictures. If you want to go inside, go around to the side door. Inside, you can pose for pictures at the customs inspector's desk and peruse some historical exhibits."
Picture Worthy,"This building is well-preserved and fun to pose for a picture in front. I don't know if it is ever open, but it is part of the walking tour and is a definite stopping spot. Take a look."
"Japanese Customs Building, 1908","This 115 year structure is of European design, a often common preference by Imperial Japan when constructing official government buildings. The survival of any Japanese building (of significance) from the Colonial period is quite exceptional. The Old Customs House has played a central role in the story of Japanese Colonialism in Korea. One of the buildings primary functions was as a gateway for Korean goods to be transferred to Japan (particularly rice). The exploitation of Korea by Japan (and some pro-Japanese Koreans) is evident for any visitor of historical Gunsan.For me the building (now a small museum) is a great starting point for visitors in Gunsan, specifically those who have historical curiosity. The building is quite small, but taken together with the other Japanese Colonial structures in the city, they provide a lasting picture of Pre- WWII Gunsan."
