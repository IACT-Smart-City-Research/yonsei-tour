Very Enjoyable Half Day at Jeolmul,"30 mins drive out from Jeju City. My Wife and Daughter accompanied me on the first 2.5km of the 11.1km yellow route, then they took a short cut back (around 1.2km) to relax at the Korean style picnic tables and visit the carp pond. I took another 1.5 hrs or so to complete the yellow route, which by the way is circular, not an up and back as reported sometimes previously. I came across plenty of deer, as well as some beautiful birds and flowers. The first 5km or so has hessian Mats to walk on, which is very peasant, but then it gets a bit muddy and rocky, with a few steep sections.....walking boots or trail shoes are definitely best, although possible in Trainers. Really enjoyed the hike."
Jeomul Oreum Trail 0.8km,"We went with our boys for a short hiking. Jeomul Oreum trail is shady and only takes 45min. There are few junctions at the top of the trail which might be confusing. The maps say one big round trail, ultimately it is the same way up and down. If you took the wrong trail, it will lead to 5km trail. Overall good and short trail for the kids."
Perfect for a weekend getaway with the family,"The locals come here for a picnic. This place also has a few playgrounds for children. If you ever wanted to go to the observatory, it would require some hiking so wear proper clothes. Was the view worth the hike? I think other places in Jeju provide better views than the one here."
Huge place with lots of various length walks.,There are lots of walks but very badly marked.They are colour coded but the trails arn't.Very confusing especially if you can't read Korean.They range between 1-11 kms long.In march all the trees were still bare so not very attractive walks.
Therapeutic walk ,The park was quiet when I visited. It was an easy walk with nice trees and scenery. It had a great calming effect on me. Love it. Just 5 minutes drive from the park is the Hanwha Resort Jeju which I went for a fantastic spa treatment. My afternoon was made perfect ! 
In nature's lap,It was such a nice experience at Jeolmul Natural Forest Resort. The location is so scenic that no pictures do any justice.
Gwongemumseong fortress,"A very beautiful and peaceful, cooling place. Full of natural trees. I went after rain,vision not clear from hill top. But I love this natural scenery. It is money back guarantee for Korean people if can not view anything from hill top with heavy mist. Anyway announcement were made if there is heavy mist during rain. "
A walk to calm the soul,"Understand there are three courses here - 30 mins, 60 and 90. Basically it’s a very light forest with pine and a few other trees that I am not familiar with. You choose the course and just take your time to walk - the air is fresh, nobody speaks loudly. The path will meander through trees, laughing statues, water fountain, and more trees. Would definitely recommend coming this place for those who want to calm their nerves and leave the city behind. We took the 30 mins course and came out refreshed. "
Such a great place!!!,"After the big snow fall last week, 2/3 place is closed to visit however, still the rest of part that I can visit and walk around were super great! Admission is 1,000 KRW(less than a 1 USD, 0.80Euro, maybe). There is small sack kiosk at the entrance/ parking lot. They have very nice OMEGI rice cake and fish cake soup(oden)!! Great taste and owners are very kind and smiley. In the forest, there is small Buddhist' temple where provides free 3 in 1 coffee and green tea bag with hot water. Looking inside of temple was also great pleasure. There is pond and feet washing place but it was not accessible today due to the heavy snow. One thing I also loved very much and spent more than 30 min inside, is "" experience building for phytoncide"" in Korean, 산림욕, 山林浴! Cozy and warm after the cold from outside walk, and I loved the smell of natural woods inside. They have 4 different type of rooms, as far as I remember. On my way back to hotel, I met local gentlemen, they told me Summer is the BEST to visit and can feel real Phytoncide with great ambiance. Even I could not visit whole places, it worth to be there. If you visit there now or winter, please make sure your shoes, like hiking shoes or bring your EISEN, protecting gear against sliding. Kids will love this place too."
Nice fresh walking trails,This is a well maintained natural forest. You can walk here after visiting the Roe Deer Observation Centre or take the Jeju City bus. There are many trails and a fair amount of visitors. Entrance fee is payable and a car park is available at the entrance.
Pretty Walking Trails and Fresh Air,"Our plans to visit Hallasan were foiled by a typhoon the night before (we luckily still got to go, though), and we were all excited to do a nice hike. We came here probably 2 or 3 hours before the park closed (we did some other sightseeing instead of Hallasan, this happened to be close by), and the admission was free because the typhoon had caused some damage. Anyways, because of the typhoon and the time of day, the park wasn't very busy. It felt like we had the walking paths to ourselves most of the time (we chose one of the shorter routes because we didn't want to run out of time). It was a nice, easy, relaxing walk. It was also dead quiet except for the occasional group of ladies walking by with music playing on their phone's speaker. Oh and the crows going off every now and then, but that was kind of amusing since their call is funny to me (and different from North American crows). A good alternative if you can't go up some of the steeper stairs and stuff like in Hallasan. We got plenty of beautiful photos because the typhoon the night before gave all the woods a nice, moody atmosphere. If you like going for walks in the woods (even though these are all wooden paths), just being outdoors enjoying the fresh air, and you have enough time, this is worth a visit. If you are short on time and can only do one park or something, then make sure you try to at least go to Hallasan. I would definitely recommend this park over Hallasan though if you have any mobility issues, because the wooden paths are very easy to walk on and there doesn't seem to be a lot of uphill/stairs."
Beautiful Natural Forest!,"Jeolmul Natural Forest is a must-see in Jeju Island. I really love the lush greenery in the forest park. There are many trails, each with different length and level of difficulty. We only had slightly less than 2 hours in the park. Therefore we only managed to walk the Samwool-gil trail followed by climbing the Oreum Trail (many steps, may get slippery if it rain) and explore the relaxing garden/ pond area. If I come again, I will allocate at least half a day in this beautiful forest. The entrance fee in only KRW1000, and there was a small stall at the entrance whereby you can grab a coffee or buy something to eat. Do not miss it if you are in Jeju Island."
"Very clean air, relaxin","We visited a part of this forest during a day tour. The air was refreshingly clean. The paths leading through the forest are nicely done. There is also a fountain of mountain water, which is apparently very clean and healthy. Small but cute."
If you cone to Jeju this is a DON'T MISS!!,"Wow! I'm glad I saw this before leaving! Jeju is full of surprises and this is one of them. We were extremely lucky this was a foggy day because seeing this place in fog was really special. The amazing display of wood carvings etc at the wood exhibition place was amazing as we're all the large insects carved out of cedar wood. It's a 20 min drive from Jeju City. Apparently in summer you have to protect your lunch from the crows! A nice easy walk and an oreum (hill) trail if you want something a bit harder. There are lots of carved statues all along the way and one of those stone paths which you can walk on with your shoes off. I manage about 2 feet, too hard for me! Haha!"
Nice experience!,"It will provide you an experience while moving in a forest. It seems like we are really get in trouble in the forest as it is so big that you cannot even think to return if you have traveled enough. We were three, so we were talking while moving in the forest. Time approx. 3 hrs to return back. Overall, it was a nice experience."
Jelmul Nature Refreshing Forest in Jeju,This place has several themed hiking trails. You can choose one of them according to your allotted time. You can walk comfortably under the shady trees. I recommend this place is a must-see in Jeju.
Jeju Island,That was amazing. I used to be student in SKorea. And it was my best memorable trip in that time. Its a little expensive specially for students. We were around 30 persons and our hotels was really good smin services and the price. I really recommend u to travel Jeju once go to SK. 
Hikers Paradise,A great place to go hiking. A range of trails to choose from and follow for beginners and advanced hikers. Spend one or two hours or the whole day - best to go in the fall or spring.
Beautiful place for a walk,Enjoyed the hike in the morning. There is also a natural spring where you can drink the water. Recommended place to visit if you have a time and enjoy hiking in a natural forest.
Relax,"Jeolmul Natural Recreation Forest, walking through these wood is believed to enhance cardiovascular function and to prevent asthma and tuberculosis. This is the most famous forest on Jeju island and here you can taste mineral water that is thought to relieve muscle and gastrointestinal problem"
