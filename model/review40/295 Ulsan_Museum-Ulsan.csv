Clear description of industrial activities,"I first came to Ulsan 22 years ago and since then every one or two years for buisness.My activity is petrochemicals, and I knew that Ulsan has also the biggest ship building yard in the world.But I ignored about the other activities in this town and how it started.PRO : the entrance is freeCON : More explanations in English would be welcome"
Excellent Service!,Just come here on a rainy day and got really warm and thoughtful welcome from staff call Irene. She even help us call out for online taxi to Science Museum. Thanks a lot...! 
New museum since 2011,"Not a very big museum, just the right size. Free entrance and great place to showcase korean culture and technological marvel of south korea."
GREAT,"This museum has many pluses. It is free, it is small, so you won't get bored, and the restaurant HAS THE BEST buckwheat noodles in all of Korea, for only 4000 won (4USD)"
Excellent Provincial Museum showcasing Ulsan's Cultural and Industrial History,"Relatively modern museum (opened 2011), located adjacent to Ulsan Grand Park and easily accessible from downtown Ulsan. The permanent exhibitions located on the 2nd Floor are divided into two main Galleries; the 'History Gallery' showing the history and culture of Ulsan from prehistoric times up until the establishment of the Ulsan Industrial Metropolis and the 'Industrial History Gallery' concentrating on the development of Ulsan as an industrial centre from the sixties/seventies up until the present day.I certainly was unaware of the amount of prehistoric sites in the Ulsan Metropolitan Area and this visit to the museum prompted me to subsequently visit such sites, e.g.: the petroglyph rock art in nearby Ulju, etc. As a ""foreigner"" working in Ulsan, the Industrial History was of particular interest to me and I was drawn to the exhibits concerning the automotive industry (Hyundai Motor Company) and the Shipbuilding/Offshore Construction (Hyundai Heavy Industries). Don't miss the Hyundai Pony - Korea's First Original Model from 1979 (remember when wing-mirrors were actually located on the front wings!).Entrance to the permanent exhibitions is free. When I visited there was an exhibition of 'Egyptian Treasures from the Brooklyn Museum' in one of the two Special Exhibition Galleries for which they charged a fee (discounted for Seniors like myself). This for me was 'icing on the cake' in a thoroughly enjoyable visit which included a pizza lunch in the attractive Bistro/Cafeteria on the 2nd Floor."
The place is warth to visit and learn the way the city developed.,"At time for my visit, there was exhibition of religious treasures of Israel and the guide was so kind to explain us all details and spent with us about an hour and draw our attention to the historical point. The Ulsan museum is well-established and location is very convenient just next to Ulsan Grand park. "
Korean Heritage & Industrial History,"The Ulsan Museum which is very easily accessible is located adjacent to the Ulsan Grand Park, Nam-gu (further up from Gonguptap Rotary). Entrance is free for the general exhibits. Some exhibition areas are subject to a fee. Tickets can be obtained on the ground floor. The only downside is that most exhibits are in Korean language with minimal English translation. Improvements to the translation would have been very helpful.The museum educates visitors on the Korean cultural heritage and its subsequent industrialisation prowess. A children's interactive area (in Korean) is also provided. All-in-all, it's worth the visit as it gives you a good look at the Korean way of life."
A fair city museum,"Housing in a building of really interesting, modern architecture, it is divided in two parts (excluding the temporary exhibitions): History and Technology. So, it demonstrates the past and the present of Ulsan area. It is not a must-see spot, however, if you have more time after your visit in Ulsan Grand Park, a pass through the museum will get you deeper inside in the early and modern history of the area. The most of the information is written only in Korean, however the museum staff is eager to answer your questions and to give you more information about the exhibits.Hint: there is a quite cute coffee shop at the second floor of the museum."
Worth a visit,"Not a bad museum. It's not extremely large, but moderate sized. Of course being in Korea; the exhibit's are dominantly in Korean. The exhibit that I saw did contain a decent amount of English and there were many interesting artifacts on display. "
Very helpful,It helps you understand so much of Korean culture. Their history and AMAZING comeback after the Korean War is fascinating. 
Small but growing,The museum is fairly new. The first time went it had just opened that summer ( August 2011). They have free events one saturday a month. The showcases are interesting and some are translated into English. Its very small now but growing. I haven't tried the restaurant but I heard its really good. 
Ulsan museum is very good!,"Ulsan museum is located in Ulsan, Nam-gu shinjungdong. The museum is dived into the first floor and the second floor. The first floor is Front desk, special exhibition gallery, museum shop etc. and The second floor is history gallery, industrial history gallery, activity room, library, auditorium etc.Amog them, we went history gallery. History gallery exhibits history and culture of Ulsan dived into time-specific, thematic,In Ulsan museum, a lot of things, we can't see now. For example, the first Korean car called PONY, initial dwawing of industry top, etc. In addition, many things exist in this museum.Visiting hour is 9:00am ~ 6:00pm. Closed day is Monday each week. Admission is free. Group tours can apply at the museum website."
The Ulsan Museum: Well Designed and Beautiful,"After visiting the Ulsan Whale Museum, I did not have my hopes up for the Ulsan Museum. I mean really, how much history could Ulsan really have? Well, it turns out that it has a lot and the museum also hosts exhibits from other countries as well turning what could have been a huge waste of money into an elegant modern museum that is worth going to!The museum is located next to the main gates of Ulsan Grand Park. It is just a little bit up the road from Gonguptap Rotary and is quite easy to get to by bus. This is a huge advantage over the other tourist sites around Ulsan that seem to be placed in the middle of nowhere. The museum has a permanent history of Ulsan exhibit on the 2nd floor and the special exhibitions are located on the 1st floor and turn the left as you walk in. The history of Ulsan exhibit is free of charge and extremely laid out. The special exhibits cost around 3,000 to 5, 000 won, depending on the exhibit.The History of Ulsan is chronologically laid out so that you start in the prehistoric time and work your way through the Japanese occupation to the industrial age of Ulsan. The pieces are beautiful and well displayed. There is also a lot of things to do for children along with an ""experience center"" for kids on the first floor.They finished the museum off with a Bistro/cafe which is nice but located at the back/side of museum, so I am not sure how long it will be located there as the location does not seem to suit it. However, you can get a nice cup of coffee and something to eat there. All in all this is an impressive facility for Ulsan and one that I will happily return to when they have some great exhibits from around the world."
