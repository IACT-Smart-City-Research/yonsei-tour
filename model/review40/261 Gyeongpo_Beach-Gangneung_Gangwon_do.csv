Come quite frequently,"I live not far from this area and so have been coming to Gangneung quite regularly for six years now. Gyeongpo is a wonderful place in that the beaches of the East Sea are far cleaner than those on the West Coast of Korea. The water quality is excellent. Wonderful to swim in. The adjacent lake is an excellent place for bird watching, with herons, cormorants, and sandpipers dominant from April to October, followed by various migratory duck species from late fall to early spring. My only gripe about the area is that the restaurants are slightly overpriced IMO. Can rent tubes and do paragliding, jetskiing, etc. St John's hotel, with one of the best saunas in the area, is a 15~20 minute walk away at Gangmun Beach."
Very good,"The place is good, a very beautiful lake view from the hotel, needs more attention to hotel management. the supplementary items are not up to the mark."
Expected more,"Expected so much more.The beach is known for its romantic resting sculptures for couples. But there are just a few, spread along the wide beach. I really meant it by 'wide'. You gotta walk to each and everyone of them.The beach is huge. Lots of sand before you could reach the water.Directions:. Gangneung Bus Terminal. Bus 202. Alight at Gyeongpodae Beach"
Excellent beach..,"C ( 18.12.18 ) The beach was famous place, and one of excellent beach in East Sea. There was well-managed and had good sand. There was very good place to enjoy sea bathing in summer and walk along the beach. Excellent beach."
Excellent site for sunrise,Wake up early and be rewarded with a surreal experience of the epic sunrise seen directly from the beach. The horizon stretches uninterrupted end-to-end.
Realy nice(for korea standards),We live in Gangneung so we visit gyeongpo beach alot in the summer. The beach is quite nice and warm in the summer. The only downpoint is that is always packed of people. In the night they always have some festivals or music playing so its good even in the night. You could visit many restaurants and bars around that place in the morning and night plus during the day you could rent boats! 
Beautiful beach with less people ,"This is a beautiful beach located in the east coast of korea. The area got a boost with the winter Olympics of 2018. Many new hotels, motels, restaurants and coffee shops were built. Unfortunately after the Olympics not many people are visiting. Beaches are beautiful, white sand and long and importantly not crowded. Recommended to visit. "
Nice decked beach walk,I loved this nice long beach walk which is decked so it's very easy to walk while enjoying the ocean and pine trees on the other side.
A beach visit tied into the winter Olympics,"We attended the winter Olympics and our accommodations were a block away from the beach. We used the great amenities of restaurants and hotels that catered to the beach crowd to our vantage. It was cold and windy while we were there, so not your typical beach weather. In celebration of the Olympics there were some great sculptures and other displays which made the cold weather less of a factor as we still enjoyed our time on the beach."
"Clean, beautiful, and great sunrises","This is a very popular beach, although there was no swimming in February! I was here for the Olympics, and there were cool large sculptures on the beach, intended to be burned on weekends. The sunrises were gorgeous, and there are lots of good food choices nearby."
Very nice beach,I went there during the Winter Olympics and was pleasantly surprised by its state. It was very clean even though there were many people and a lot of interesting artwork. Very nice place.
Winter Visit - Pretty Beach,"I enjoyed the beach very much. I went during the Winter Olympics so there was a lot of artwork on the beach, but even without it, the views of the ocean were extremely clear (if not a little cold!). Apparently there is a waterfall towards the north end of the beach, but I did not go there, walking south instead. The beach was clean, despite there being a lot of tourists on the beach (presumably busy due to the artwork exhibition there as part of the 2018 Olympics). Stores & Toilets: there are several restaurants just off the beach. I had the most delicious crab at one of them. My dinner spot had a bathroom, and I imagine there were a few others along the beach as well. Accessibility: it had a boardwalk along the sand for those who may have a slower/harder time walking, compete with some benches every once in a while. This was not right against the water's edge, but still had a great view."
Olympic Breach Walk,"Great beach too lounge at, lots of art installations and amazing shops/restaurants on the boardwalk. Shade and sun in plenty."
EXTREMELY Good Beach,I'm going back here in the summer so much friendly people so many sweet small places 2 eat and drinknot exclusive ones family places amazing water and the sand is to die 4 
Winter Visit,The beach is very pretty but our visit was during the winter so very very cold. There are many coffee shops on the ocean drive. 
Beautiful beach with solid waves,The Fire Art Festival was on just prior to the Olympics starting so the beach was full of massive impressive sculptures mostly fashioned out of wood. These were going to be ignited on a nightly basis. This would be a cracking place to come back to in summer
Gyeongpo Fire Arts Festa During 2018 Olympics,"The Fire Arts Festa will be taking place during the 2018 Olympics on this beautiful beach in Gangneung, site of the 2018 Winter Olympics Coastal Region. The assortment of sculptures and artworks share the culture of Korea and are designed to light up the beach at Gyeongpo. The weather is quite chilly during February, near 32F or 0C. Hand warmers are always a good idea. For video check out you tube ""Amy Moncure""."
Long sandy beach,Long sandy beaches with gentle waves rolling in. Lovely walk either on the beach or looking at the restaurants with all the fish tanks outside
"Fresh water, silky sand with velvet blue sky.","As I traveled to Gangneung for a sport event in February, 2017, I had the chance to visit this beach. It's in winter so of course I couldn't swim, and I don't know if we're allowed to swim here in summer or not. However, it'd be a nice place to hang out for family and friends when you want to escape the hectic life. The atmosphere is great, with fresh-looking water and silky golden sand too.Near the beach, there is also a road full of pine trees. They look amazing and would be perfect for taking some pictures."
Beautiful beach,"Great for romantic strolls, if you are lucky you can even find a free swing and watch the waves. Very busy at peak times but truly lovely"
Great beach,This is such a great beach - it's beautiful and quiet. Great places to eat nearby. It's great for young children - they enjoy running around and playing in the water.
lovely beaches and seaview,"I love the beach and the quietness, clear blue sea and refreshing cool air. Lots of seafood restaurant and cafe to choose from."
Gyeonpo Beach ,Beautiful beach. Clear blue water. There are lots of good restaurants and coffeeshops across the street. 
Lovely area,"Had a lovely walk along the beach, plenty restaurants and cafes to stop off at. Also lake is right there, had a nice walk aroun that area too."
The beach,A must visit for anyone visiting. Lovely views. There are some beautiful walks along the beach. We walked about 2 miles north and there are currently plenty of new cafes being built 
Breathtaking!,Make sure you visit this beach while in GangNeung Area. The white sandy beach along with clear blue water is something you just can't forget.
Just a Nice Beach,Clean and nice beach with a hassle-free waterfront. The sea is the Pacific Ocean and not pacific at all times!
Beach trip,Drove out to spend the day at the beach from our mountain retreat at Alpenesia. Loved the beach and searching for beach glass. Great afternoon!
Very nice place to hang out in the evening,"The beach is very neat, large, not overly crowded (especialy in the morning and afternoon). People gather there at night to make fireworks and drink beers or whatever. So if you like to bath in the afternoon it's a nice spot, and sitting there in the evening is very pleasant. Every shot near the beach will sell drinks and fireworks, and people use them all night long. "
Skip Busan,"Every review says Busan has the best beaches in Korea, that's simply not true. Gyeongpo is the best beach in Korea (in my humble opinion). This is the closest to the aqua blue waters with white sand that you have in Hawaii and Gold Coast. If you are a serious beach lover, skip Busan and go to Gyeongpo Beach. It's also far less crowded than Busan."
"Not crowded at all, clean water","I was very surprised at how clean these waters are!!, well maybe just because my country's beaches are super dirty lol. But the beach is really pretty and it's not crowded, at least it wasnt when I went on July but on peak summer season, I guess there might be a lot more people. Water sport activities are offered and boats or jet skis to rent. There's also a lake near and many restaurants."
One of the most beautiful beach in Korea,"In my opinion, this beach is definitely one of the best in Korea with the nice and clean sea. It is also not crowded, you can enjoy the ocean breeze peacefully."
Cool white sand beach,"I went there on June but wasn't on peak season so there were not that many people. The beach was beautiful and the water is cold. If you plan to swim, please be careful since the wave was really strong, at least when I went there.I took bus 202 from Gangneung bus terminal, its last stop was Gyeongpo beach's bus stop. You can pay the bus fare with T-money and cash."
"Great beach, fun activities","The beach and the lake are so close as to almost touch. Walk or bike around a 4.4 km path that wraps around the lake. Depending on the season, check out the lotus blossom festival, the cherry blossom festival or just the beautiful view, complete with statues, wetlands, parks, woods, historical buildings and fitness activities.A stone throw from the lake, go to the beach for restaurants or coffee shops, or just to lay back in the sand. Crab is a local favorite here. It's not cheap, but it's tasty! There's also a boardwalk that goes all along the beach, and a bicycle path that starts in Busan (way down south!), connects to Gyeongpo Beach and goes further north to Sokcho.Tip #1: At night you can buy fireworks at any of the corner shops and set them off. Just please clean up afterwards. ;) Tip #2: You can order fried chicken or pizza from local delivery restaurants and they'll deliver it to you right on the beach!! Again, please pick up after yourself to keep the beach beautiful!During the summer, the beach gets a bit crowded and any umbrellas or tents cost 5,000-10,000 won to use. Bonfires aren't really allowed here, but camping and bonfires are both allowed a little further north between Gyeongpo Beach and Sacheon Myeon. "
Beautiful beachfront,"Visited the area during winter months so it is not crowded. It's windy and hence cold but tolerable for a stroll. There are swings located along the beach for those who want to sit for a while and enjoy the view. From the bus terminal, it is about a 30min ride on bus 202. Timetable of the city bus schedule is available at the tourist information center. The latest as at Jan 16 is as per attached in the photo. "
"Clean, fresh, and enjoyable.","Located on the East Sea, this beach provides a swimming experience in the Summer, Fall sightseeing, brisk Winter walks and, Spring delights as the cherry blossoms enliven the last kilometers travel to this destination.Note: Most folks from Gangneung do not go there in the Summer because of the large number of tourists. They, instead, prefer to visit it in the Fall and Winter. "
Best Beach in South Korea,"The Best Beach in South Korea. Its on the East coast, around 2 hours ride from Seoul. You ca take a limousine bus from DongSeoul to Gangneung for around 14000won. From Gangneung you can take a city bus no 202 or can en-quire at the tourist information center at Bus terminal."
Crystal Clear Water,"This is a lovely, large beach with nice sand and blue, clear water. There is a fabulous tall rock formation for the adventurous to climb to get great views. The adjacent area has many restaurants and are amenable to using their facilities."
Hammocks and wooden decks along the beach,"A big and nice beach! I was there in the middle of September 2015 and at that time the waves was quite big. It's a wooden deck along the beach so you can walk by the beach without getting some sand in your shoes. It was also some hammocks on the beach, which was very nice to sit in."
Best beach in mainland Korea,"This is absolutely the best beach in mainland Korea. The water is crystal clear and extremely clean. There are tons of fun waves, although sometimes it can be quite rough, so be careful. There are fun activities to do if that's your thing, or you can just pay w10,000 to lay under a parasol all day. There are great cafes and restaurants (I recommend Paul & Mary's for their burgers) nearby, as well as CU/GS/711. There is a drop off very close to the shore, so the water is deep (but adults can tough the floor) quickly, which I prefer. No need to walk very far out. I loooove this beach! Totally worth a trip, even just for a weekend."
"Blue, calm water; relaxing atmosphere. Dangerous traffic.","My family visited during peak vacation season but the beach wasn't too busy at all!!!!!! The water was so blue and clear.There are many different stands that offer parasol, tube, raft and life jacket rentals. There are also a few vendors that offer raft rides over the ocean and jumping off a big balloon blob.The water was really calm our first night, nothing at all like the beaches in South Carolina. The waves don't crash on to the shore -in fact the only time there were waves was when a boat or jet ski passed.Many different restaurants line the street in front of the beach. We walked in one seafood restaurant and saw a meal set was 350,000-450,000won, so we went down the street to a fried chicken place. The evening/night seemed busier than the beach during the day, there were lots of people out at night. Down the beach there seemed to be a stage with some live music and people were setting off fireworks.My only negative comment would be about the traffic. There are hotels/stores/restaurants, a road in front, then the beach. Cars just speed along the street without stopping for pedestrians or even slowing down when you cross the street. That can be very dangerous and it was nothing I have seen at a tourist destination before. Watch out for the traffic!"
Nice beach with clean water !,It was prefect place to travel during the summer for enjoying the swimming and sunbathing ! But it was a little bit crowded during the beginning of August !
Great beach for Korea,This beach was very clean and so refreshing. It was not that crowded compared to the beaches in Busan. The only negatives were that the sand was very coarse and the water is very salty
Beautiful beach,This is a very nice beach with Long white sand & clean water. I really enjoyed my swimming and sunbathing. The beach is also quiet & not touristy in July when i come here. Well worth a Visit.
Excellent beach,Nice wide beach with good sand.Sea is a little rough and if you are not a good swimmer it is not recommended
Local tips,"Nice beach but can be crowded during peak season in the early august. Swimming season begins around end of June and ends in the end of August. Outside the season you are not allowed to swim, go for the smaller beaches in the area. "
Fantastic place In Korea !,"There is more to Korea than Seoul! So, you should go to the countryside this time. I recommend that you go to the East Sea. Kyungpodae is especially the best I have ever been to. There are lots of things to do. First, there are beautiful beaches along the coastlines. It is shallow water and very clean sand. Plus, there’s a nice long walkway for strolling. There are beach volleyball facilities and they have a nice relaxing walking path either next to the beach or under the trees. Moreover, you can meet lots of new people at night. You can not only have really awesome seafood, but also enjoy water sports with your family or friends. My personal favorite seafood is fried Rockfish. It tastes clean and good with Soju! You need to go to the beach to ride on a banana boat too. The banana boats bounce and sometimes get turned over. it is good way to cool off in the summer heat. There is wonderful mountain called Seoraksan. Seoraksan National Park was designated the 5th national park in Korea and has been designated as a Biosphere Preservation District by UNESCO in 1982. It has spectacular scenery during the fall when all leaves turn red and yellow. The view from the top is awesome. You can see the whole city from there. Over 2,000 animal species live there. For example, bears, squirrels, elks. There are also more than 1,400 rare plant species. While climbing the mountain, you can find a cave. It’s a long time since it was found. The cave is very big and awesome. Cave products such as stalactites, cave corals, are well preserved in the cave. Also, if you want to climb the mountain a long way, there are easy trails, don’t worry about that. There are various festivals held throughout the city all year long. A Snow Festival is held during in winter, So, you must go there to enjoy winter such as snow mobile, snow sledding. In May, there are cherry blossom festivals. Go with your boyfriend or girlfriend and have good time! One more thing you should do is watch traditional Korean sports. Wrestling is the sports that represents Korea the best because wrestling is Korean traditional sports. The competition normally held on holidays. There are also special performances by Korean famous singers. It’s pretty exciting. In Korea, there are much more beautiful places than you think. So, if you travel the countryside, you will have good memories in your life. Come to the East Sea in Korea!"
beautiful beach,"i just went to sit by the sea for 3 days and not see anyone! really beautiful - my favourite in Korea not crowded saw some guys fishing saw some guys collecting seaweed saw some jellyfish washed up great weather, bright and warm the sea water was a quite cold so i wasn't too tempted to swim but you could walk all day will definitely be back and i appreciated those 3 people who were picking up the trash, so, it was pretty clean :)"
Lovely beach with long walkway,"We went during Chuseok, so although this is touted as the most popular beach in Gangneung and tends to get very crowded, we found it very peaceful and quiet, with only scattered visitors and plenty of open space. We swam, walked and ran along the wooden walkway, enjoyed the scenery from the swing chairs and biked around Gyeongpo Lake just behind it. There are a variety of seafood & other restaurants, coffee shops and bars to choose from right on the beachfront."
Beautiful!,"Beautiful beach! very clean, nice boardwalk and covered benches everywhere. Disappointed that all chairs, umbrellas, packed away for the season even though the weather was in the 80's. Water warm and nice."
A very nice beach,"A very nice beach with fewer people. Recommended for those who like a beach with less noisy and crowded. People should be careful about the sand (where water splashes end) though, during taking a bath in the sea. A few meter inside the sea, the sand the quality is good. The beach area is very well organized. There are jet ski and and speedboat rides available for those who like a bit of adventure. Near by the sea, there is a lake (5 minute walking distance) around which several landmarks can be visited. One can borrow a bicycle for about an hour to see those landmarks and lake. Also an awesome sunset at the lake can be viewed."
Beautiful clean beach,"The beach and water is very clean, although the sand is a little coarse. Water temperature was perfect in July and the beach was not crowded. You can rent umbrellas for 10,000 KW a day and there are also water sports activities available. Shops, cafés and restaurants are nearby. There are not many public showers and restrooms, but it was ok for us as we had a hotel next to the beach (there are many reasonably priced ones).Unusual to me: First, there were many life guards and you are only allowed to swim about 15 meters till the buoys (an area where it was still possible to touch the ground). Second, many people put on fireworks on the beach in the evening, so it seems this is allowed."
Great beach with neverending night life,"This beach is very nice. I found it a surprising place to visit with a very interesting charm. Sand is nice but i was disappointed with the amount of small trash in the sand ~ mainly cigarette butts. While trash is picked up daily, there are a lack of trash bins. What made this beach really a charm are the twisted pines that are along the sand and between the beach and stores. Nestled in and along the trees is a nice boardwalk promenade to walk along and many places to hang a hammock and enjoy the cool ocean breezes. A down turn is the lack of quality restaurants and the seafood is fairly expensive. Most menues are Korean food, but on the southern end there is a hamburger joint Lotte and the Sea Star Hotels restaurant is very good with a small but delicious menu. Water in early July was cold still and it doesnt appear to become very clear. Primarily pounding surf, however there are options for paragliding, bunjee jumping, and other motorized water sports such as skiing. The beach on weekends stys open until after midnight and parts are well lit with lights. Lots of fireworks at night... SO IF YOU ARE A LIGHT SLEEPER you should book a hotel away from beach or on back side.TIP: plan your trip to not include Saturday night, as hotel room rates will double in summer. Fridays are also higher than sun - thr in most cases."
A weekend trip to gyeongpo beach...,The third best beach as they call....the gyeongpo beach....i visited with my wife last weekend and stayed overnight...i found it to be a traveller's paradise...nice clean beaches....white sand and blue water....and not crowded at all...The water was very cold and could not take a proper bath...but the situation will change in next couple of weeks when temperature will rise a few degrees...Food is only korean and available in all beachside restaurants...its cheap too...Lots of hotels are there hust beside the sea...no need for pre-booking...
One of the best beaches in Korea,"Really a nice beach, especially for Korean standards. You'll find real beach sand, water activities, a nice board walk along the beach if you don't want sand in your shoes, and so forth. The water was really cold so swimming was difficult, and there was a bit of garbage here and there, so the local government could devote some resources to cleaning it up before it gets too bad."
Good. But never visit restaurent there.,"View and sea is good, but the price and quality of seafood restaurent near the beach is sooo poor. Visit anywhere else if u want to eat seafood."
Sparkling Korean East Coast,"I came to Gangneung by chance, I read about this beach in my guidebook and as soon as I reached the city terminal I took a taxi for Gyeongpo Beach. There I found an amazing paradise, a neverending sandy coast hitten by white waves. At night a part of the beach is illuminated and on the street there are a lot of restaurants where you can eat the famous spider crab of the Sea of Japan. It's quite expensive but it's worth it. I suggest to come to Gangneung from Samcheok using the Sea Side Train where seats are placed facing the windows so you can have an overall look on the amazing east coast of Korea, full of big beaches like Gyeongpo. It's a ""very touristic"" experience and you will see also not so fascinating suburban compounds but it's quite enjoyable and unique. You have to book the seats at least one day in advance."
"Coarse sand, but nice hangout","The beach here has fairly coarse sand so the slope is pretty steep up to the water. The beach is also full of small shells.It's not such a great beach for playing frisbee or volleyball, but there is a nice wooden boardwalk all along the beach for running or walking.Don't be fooled by the ""Shower Room"" signs. I was never able to find the shower room. What I did find was a large restroom where there was a community hose on the outside of the building."
Spring is best with the cherry blossoms,"What I find unique about this beach is the cherry trees on the avenue leading to the beach. The beauty of these trees in blossom in the spring is just breathtaking and worth a visit on its own. Also, visiting this beach to watch the sunrise over the ocean is worth while too. "
one of the most famous beach in Korea,"In short, Gyeongpo Beach is so beautiful and attractive.Gyeongpo Beach is a sand bank formed between Gyeongpo Lake and the ocean. This beautiful beach extends to a length of 6 km and is covered with fine sand.Gyeongpo Beach is famous for its picturesque sunrise and tranquil moonrise. There are other nearby attractions in the area, like Gyeongpodae, Gangneung Seongyojang, Charmsori Gramophone & Edison Science Museum, Ojukheon and so many others."
