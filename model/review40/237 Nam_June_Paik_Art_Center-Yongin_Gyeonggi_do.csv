Hidden gem in the city,"If you are the fan of Nam June Paik, you will love this museum. Quite big collection of his works including not so known to public ones. If you don’t know him, still good choice cuz museum itself is very adorable. "
"A pleasent surprise, just annoying to get to without a car.","The sad part is this, the PR is terrible for such a pleasent and well built art facility. People who live in the neighborhood rarely know that this place even exsists and is almost free for Yong-In residents (1000won) literally a dollar for residents.They have great shows for kids and adults and has progressive exhibitions that usually engage the spectators so if your a geek or love to experience physically they will usually have shows that are close to this vicinity. Shows are seriously great and should have more attention from locals, Ive lived in NYC and have seen great multinedia shows but Paik art center curators do a great job.The two downfall is how annoying this place is to get to. It is not ideal to take a bus, just take a cab from gihueng station and youll be there in minutes. The last part is they have the worst museum shop that sell literally garbage.... this shop was such a horrible shame compared to how well the exhibitions were showcased."
all art lovers must visit,"i didn't know it is a type of a new media museum - make sure you visit the café there, pretty good outdoor sitting too."
World Known Media Artist,"An art center showcases the works by world known media artist Nam June Paik, especially nice souvenirs shop design and outdoor rooftop cafe space."
Excellent place to see work of Nam June Paik and other artists,"Near the Gyeonggi Provincial Museum and Gyeonggi Children's Museum. A very good museum of contemporary art. Changing displays on a number of levels, so it's worth a return visit."
Awesome museum!,"I have been here a few times, it's an awesome and unique art museum. It's really close to the Folk Village and Gyeonggi Provincial museum (Literally a 2 minute walk from the Gyeonggi Provincial museum bus stop). You could do a few of these things together if you're coming from Seoul. It costs 4,000 won but is only 2,000 if you live in Gyeonggi. It has some interactive pieces, and a cute little gift shop. Definitely bring your camera! There is a nice coffee shop across the street (Hide Park), and some good restaurants nearby as well.^^"
must-visit art museum <3,"NJP Art Center was so interesting place to visit. Because it focuses on the art of Nam June Paik and his influence on the present art, you can see a variety of Paik's works and other artists' works using the up-to-date technologies and media, and also experimental performances. Unlike the other art museums in Seoul, I think this one is more experimental and open to various changes. And I heard that this year is 80th anniversary of Paik and the art center has been preparing the big exhibition to celebrate the anniversary in this coming July. So, if you have a plan to visit Seoul after July, you should go and enjoy the exhibition! The only flaw is that it's a little far from Central Seoul, you can take the red-line bus or subway (sin-bundang line) to get there. But it is certainly worth a visit! =)"
Fantastic place to visit near Seoul!,"I was very impressed visiting NJP art center, since my major is related to art and culture.You can see a lot of Nam June Paik's unique art works and enjoy your time playing around the center with you family or friends! I defenately recommand this place to visit if you want to see most famous art works in Korea!!"
