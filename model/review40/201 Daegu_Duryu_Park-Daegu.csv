Nice park,"There are landmark Daegu Tower, outdoor stadium, walking paths, lights displayed in winter time. It's one of greatest places that families, couples and friends enjoy in here. "
A Green Zone in an Enormous City.,"The Duryu Park is located on the center of Daegu City. Although it's rare it's similar to the Hyde Park in London and the Central Park in New York in respect that it's located on the center of an enormous city. The more developed a city, the more needed a green zone like a park reversely."
Chicken & Beer Festival,"Awesome! Must see and do this once a year event! The chicken choices are endless, the beer is the local favorite Cass and the entertainment is spectacular!"
Really big park in Daegu,"Around the park there are many things including the Art Center, 83 Tower and Eland. There are bike renting shops also. You'd better borrow one there if you plan to travel around the park."
Great city park,"This park hosts many events such as the Body Painting Festival and the Lantern Festival within the various facilities inside. There is a swimming pool , gardens, nice places to stroll. It's easily accessible by bus or metro."
Wonderful day spent at the park,"Park is right across the street from notorious E-World. The park was beautiful, kid friendly and full of nature. My friend and I walked for a good 10 miles around the park and we didn't even get close to seeing all the sites. There are many statues and little sites of interesting tidbits of knowledge. We went in the evening and were able to see a gorgeous view of Daegu. Although at night when it got dark, some parts of the hike trails were not well lit, but so many people were out that I still felt safe. "
Large park,"This is a large park with stadium, water park children play ground and etc. No realDistinguishable features "
A hilltop forest in the city,"It's easy to wander around the park for a long time, as there are numerous paths, some challenging, some gentle. A good place to get some shade from the sun but also enjoy the outdoors."
Beautiful park,"I really like this park. I don't know about winter time, but in summer it's so beautiful with flowers. Good to visit with family as well."
Huge space to get lost in,"I won't lie, we got lost wandering around this big park, some of the paths were very steep. We didn't have a map so didn't know where the nearest tube was and ended up flagging down a taxi to get us home. The biggest issue we found was the lack of signs and information on where we were."
City Park with Major Attractions ,Within this park area is an amusement park and the 83 Tower. The park is large and takes time to circumvent. It is near a couple of subway stops. 
Beautiful Park,This park is absolutely beautiful. We visited on a nice sunny day and we enjoyed the natural sights and sounds. 
Went for the annual INternational Body Painting Contest,"Too bad it rained. There were bands and of course the body painting. That was new to me...seemed like something not for kids...not really pornographic...but sort of. The park itself could use a little repair...path lights are rusting, etc."
A nice big park in the big city,"A big park in a busy city, not amazing and not that special, but has nice cherry blossoms in the spring, and is good for dates or simple walks in the park. You can rent bicycles and cycle around as well :)"
a nice city park,This urban park is a good place for walking or jogging. There are cafes for a nice rest and a coffee.
Nice but not as great as Apsan or Palgonsan,"In a pretty dense city, this patch of green is certainly precious. Many festivals seem to be held here. But if you are seeking nature, I'd suggest you go to the mountains."
"Nice, although not a must-see","Very lovely to stroll through especially in Autumn. Lots of activity, we saw some sort of dance show by accident, young children performing. I wouldn't go out of my way to go there again though, it's good if you need a break from everything and just want to lay back and relax."
relaxing,Very nice for strolls but wouldn't go out of my way to get there. It's particularly pretty when the cherry trees are in bloom.
A lush patch of Green in the City,"Duryu Park offers great views of Daegu, and has plenty of space for the citizens of Daegu to relax and enjoy the outdoors. There are often special events on the stage, offering entertainment for the whole family. Duryu also hosts several of Daegu's Festivals, including the Chicken-and-Beer Festival, and the Daegu Lantern Festival."
Magical,Went to the body painting the last four years. Love all of the models and artists there. last year had more artist but this seemed to be a younger crowd.
Quite and beautiful Park,"Love everything about the park, esp in Autumn season. Very beautiful. It's quite and so peaceful. Great place to healing your self from your daily stressness"
An average park,"Duryu is ok, with a wide variety of festivals throughout the year. It's probably at its best in summer, when you can get fried chicken delivered to your picnic spot and there's lots of entertainment. It's a shame that during certain parts of the year the grass is roped off and you can't use it. The circular paved route used for powerwalking and running is almost 3km and is good...but if you run more than 3 or 4 laps you tend to feel a bit dizzy!"
not good,Like kids or grown-ups do not really care for it go here ^ ^English translator interpreted as do not know of all the questions in English not answer I'm gonna. I'm sorry.
great for running,"what i love about duryu park is the circular paved route, it is great for running in the afternoon, the distance for one lap is just over 2km, so its easy to keep track of your distance and there is ample water points to refresh."
"Run, Relax and Enjoy",I usually go running in the park twice a week when the weathers nice. Sundays are nice days to throw out a blanket and have a picnic and soak up the sun. Be sure to catch the International Body Painting festival every year and stay updated on the events happening in the Park. You'll be sure to have some interesting and low cost experiences.
Mixed feelings,"This is a vast area,but not sure if i was in the same place as reviews are saying,because I was disappointed about the neglect of maintenance. The parks are good,The tower is a great place to get a view of the city from,has a good ice skating rink,bungy jump,but sadly the aquarium was a let down.Fish and mammals like penguins in poor cramped conditions.I am not normally a greeny with concerns over animal welfare as such, but was disgusted at the treatment of their wildlife there.WooBang Tower Land which is adjacent is dismal to say the least,Rusting rides and no welfare or H & S for rides just get on and take your chance.First time I have had to WALK through a ghost ride attraction,only scary thing was the occassional gust of wind up your leg.Animals in the kids zoo were badly neglected and in very substandard CELLS they were housed in.This place really needs shutting down for safety concerns,or a damn good maintenance shake up."
Great park,Nice to relax in. Theres people in there that take orders for fried chicken and they give you free picnic mats and stuff. Real nice. Not much to do apart from relax
Gorgeous in spring,"Great place to take a leisurely stroll. There are tons of sporting facilities e.g. pool and baseball field. A fun way to see the park is on bike. There are bike rental facilities - 3000 won per hour (tandem and training bikes also available). You can also rent roller blades, badminton raquets and skateboards which is good because you dont have to carry all that to and from the park. "
Nice views from Daegu Tower,Duryu Park has a nice swimming pool that is especially appreciated during Korea's hot summers. The views from the tower are excellent and there are many places to buy food within the park. It is a nice way to spend a relaxing day.
