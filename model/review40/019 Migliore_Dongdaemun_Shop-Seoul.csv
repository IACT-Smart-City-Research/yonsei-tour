Designer quality and styles at great prices,"Hundreds of vendors with a huge diversity of product in one compact building on multiple floors. Great place to outfit a wardrobe for a makeover, new career, or new season."
"China + 1, South Korea -1","avoid at all cost... rude sellers, overpriced goods .. sellers at the basement 1 and 2 are very rude to tourists .. one shop even looked at us from head to foot and told us rudely that they cannot sell to us, ""Do not touch original""... i was just asking the price of the item on display even though the item covered in plastic (glad wrap)... he took the shoe from my hand that what was on display ( a very good valentino open top rock stud sneakers for men knock off)... sellers will first google the price of the LEGIT item before telling you their price... PASS on this mall... cheaper to buy in europe for Legit items that are on sale than deal with RUDE Migliore knock off sellers!!..... imho sellers in so called ""silk markets"" in mainland China are nicer to deal with... "
Typical shopping mall,"Migliore mall is located in Dongdaemun, with many shops selling fashion apparel, accessories, shoes, bags etc targeting the younger generation, especially women. Prices are reasonable. This is one of the newer malls in Dongdaemun."
Aggressive sellers,Do not bother wasting your time in this mall especially in the males section . Aggressive sellers trying to coerce you to buy super overpriced goods with nasty attitude when you don’t buy from them
"Very pressurizing, especially male section","Every store in the male section is hawking for customers. They are onto you the moment you step off the escalator. Prices are definitely way above what you can get at other areas like hongdae shopping street. I saw the same top costing 10000 Won at hongdae but the seller quoted me 38000 won at migliore. by the way, almost all items do not have price tags there so be wary. Materials also aren't of good quality to fit the prices - even after you factor in a discount of about 20-30%. They'll ask you to give them a price. But it doesnt matter because the original price is already marked up way above what you can get outside. It's essentially another trick up their sleeves. Know your materials and do not fall to pressure. Otherwise, shop at other areas like myeongdong, Sinchon or hongdae where they are a lot friendlier and they have prices which you can see."
Similar to Bangkok Platinum Mall,"We went in early morning. Hence, there was no crowd. The layout is similar to Bangkok Platinum mall. Every level selling specific stuffs. Lower level for apparel, higher level for bags, shoes, accessories, luggage. Quite a good place to shop if you know what you want. "
Cramped and crowded store,"This is a large store opposite the Dongdaemun Design Plaza and Lotte Fitin shopping mall. The store was packed with visitors and the space inside it was pretty tight so not a particularly enjoyable experience. However, visitors can find all kinds of clothing for both adults and children as well as lots of accessories.My advice is to only visit this place if you really want to find cheap clothes and accessories and have the time to spare, but please do not bring children here as it is too crowded and very hectic. The aisles are narrow and people are always pushing their way past you."
Good place to shop but some of the seller attitude can be better.,"Place at location down town, just opposite DDP design center. Good for shopping open from 10:30am to 04:30amSome of the seller may give you feelings like "" you don't buy, you don't touch""."
Not as nice as before,We have been to Migliore on previous trips and found this place had somewhat deteriorated. There were more empty units and the range seemed to be become lesser. The men's section on the 4th floor was quite scary as the sellers were more aggressive. There were a lot less shoppers as compared to 2 years ago in the same mall. The prices didnt seem as cheap anymore. We bought much lesser this time round. Will try the malls beside in the dongdaemun area the next time. 
Cluttered with small shops,"Dongdaemun area is a shopping paradise and Migliore is a multi storey store in the midst of it. It’s crowded with little shops organised around a theme eg women’s, children’s etc, but that’s about all there is in organisation! All the stores sell varied and sometimes duplicative items but if you persist, there are some good buys to be had."
Super Bad Experience ,"super bad experience here. sellers were super rude and unfriendly. this place is also filled with youngsters that are rude. i went to one of the shop and was browsing at the dresses and i was holding onto one that caught my eye. i took less than five minutes and then the seller snatched the dress away from me and asked if i wanted it so i replied that i still want to look around. she then began to mumble and say that i kept saying i want to look look look. hence, i decided to put the dress back and walk off with my sister. NEVER DID I EXPECT THAT she actually chased us and tapped on my sister's shoulder hardly and scolded: 'u look look look, no buy, no say thank you! NO MANNERS!' and then stomped off. i was so shocked by her rude and odd behaviour as we were already at another store that's quite far away! didn't expect this odd woman in her fifties (the store owner) to actually chase a customer to scold him/her. i guess she ALWAYS does this to customers as another seller actually told us to continue looking at the clothes (at another store) and ignore her. what i'm trying to say is, customers have customer rights. it doesn't mean that after we look we HAVE to buy."
A shoppers paradise,Located very close to dongdaemun subway is Migliore which opens at 10.30 in morning and is open till 4.30 am. So one can visit this place in midnight. It’s a must visit place for anyone wanting to buy clothes / accessories or bags. Both male and female clothes available. Shopping tip: remember to bargain - they easily reduce price by 30-40%.Try and shop maximum things from single shop to get maximum discounts
Nicer clothes ,"Migliore is very similar to Hello APM but stall keepers a slightly more snottier. They may have more range in nice styles of clothes but prices are a little higher above 30,000₩.Their B1 floor is stocked full of adorable baby and toddler clothes. A shopping heaven for parents!"
cool Shop,"It is nice department"" stores like this in Dongdaemun .It is not luxury like lotte mall .But, they have good deal like good cloths , luggage,Sojourners and etc.Take care you should bargain or you will buy product in high price.The staff nice and speak English.We visit this mall many times and it one of the favorite my wife.I will come back"
Shop,"There are a lot of ""department"" stores like this in Dongdaemun. They dont speak english, some stuff is overpriced"
"If you cannot speak Korean, don't go there","The sellers act like gang. When you look around the place, they keep bothering you to look at it and buy it.Also the price was way higher than my expectation. When I mentioned that is too expensive, (this is kind of routine) they ask me back ""how much you expected?"" no matter how much you mentioned, they said they cannot offer that price. When I gave up to buy it, they talked to my back.This was not just one place. I experienced every single place.I strongly recommended (warned) you. Don't go this place. This will ruin your mood and image of Korea."
Don't go to 4th floor of this place!! Very rude!!,"I went to here with my friends and most of the sellers on 4th floor who are selling men's clothes were not nice at all. We nicely asked the price of the goods, and after we were told the price, we said it was too expensive. They asked back, how much do we want, and after we gave our number, they responded rudely and said ""don't come back again."" They also speak in Korean to other sellers which I believe talking something about us. It's just very funny for us, if they are not ready to be bargained, then don't ask us to bargain.I'd prefer to shop at other places but not this 4th floor."
Honeymoon @ Migliore,This is a lower end shopping mall as compared to nearby Doota.This shopping mall is opened until 5am.Mostly clothing for men and women but more women's clothing.Price of the items can be further reduced by 10% - 30%.There is no changing room to try the clothing. Only wrap a scarf around you while changing. Try figuring out yourself The upper floors are for mens. They tend to be very pushy and aggressive. So be careful. There is no restaurant but a couple of shops selling beverages. 
Ideal place for shopaholics,"This is not only the best shopping destination I have encountered, but also the only review where I have given an 'excellent' rating. As someone who loves shopping, this place is absolutely fantastic. Seoul is known for its shopping, and from this mall I can clearly see why. The mall has cleverly separated its departments into different levels. They know their main demographic is the ladies, so 4/6 (or 3/5) of its floors are for women's fashion/ accessories. They only allocated one floor for the men and another for the children. Basically, the gave one floor each to the men and children and gave the remaining to the people whom appreciates good fashion and shopping: the ladies.The clothes they sell there have good quality and are really in style with the Korean fashion trends. Trying on clothes that I have bought makes me feel like I have just stepped into the Korean Drama realm. This is an especially great place to bring your teenage daughter, for their merchandise is really aimed at the younger crowd. The clothes here have really nice colors and cool designs, with texts and even cartoon characters and caricatures, something I don't see very fashionable for the older crowd.The quality of their merchandise are very good and pleasant to touch. However, that contributes to its higher than average prices. It definitely is more cost efficient to shop here than shop at places like Gucci or Burberry (and lets be real here the clothes they sell here are so much prettier than what you get there), which is why I love it here so much. The prices can make you feel a little overwhelmed if you are used to shopping at flea markets and bazaars (I mostly shop at Bugis Street), but for a good quality and pretty jacket that cost 50000 won is quite acceptable if you ask me. You will definitely need to pour out some cash if you are going to shop here seriously, but its not as if you need to make it rain with money here like you do when buying things from designer label brands. And at the end of the day what you pay is what you get, and who really wants things of bad quality because of its low prices these days anyway? I left the building with a huge recycling bag filled with my purchases that could easily weigh up to to a few kilos (I had a very hard and tiring night after leaving and going back to my hotel with all that weight I had to bring back.) I guess one bad thing about the place is its ventilation. We came during winter time and taking off our coats would mean we had to carry it throughout our shopping spree, and that would greatly inconvenience us. Wow the heater was unforgiving! We were practically sweating! The first time we did so in Korea! The sellers could have also been a little more polite, especially at the men's department where their behavior towards us made us a little uncomfortable. The other sellers were much better to us, even when we rejected what they were selling, they just gave us a little puppy pout like in those girls in KDramas, which did not make me feel guilty nor threatened, unlike the shops in China (I forgot which city) where a rejection meant an instant sour face. Finally, a sitting area would be nice, because we certainly needed to take a break from all that shopping, and we did not. Our legs were swelling, and my mother refused to put down the heavy bag of purchases on the floor while we shopped, so you can image how tired we were. To sum it up, this is a paradise to spend money at. I came here twice during my stay in South Korea and this was easily the best part of it."
A mini Platinum Mall (BKK) in Korea,"The first thing that came to mind in the layout and products was Platinum Mall in Bangkok, but this is a scaled down version and prices aren't as cheap as in BKK (natch). Still a nice mall to see wholesale priced clothes (more fashionable) and shoes (sneakers galore) and accessories. Was looking for glitzy sneakers but couldn't find anything with the right look and price. Picked up a couple of accessories but then .... wasn't really in a shopping mood! A good mall to visit especially since stuff was cheaper than in Doota Mall next door."
A typical big shopping center of SK,"There are a lot of small shops in a big one, no prices are written, it's the saler that tells you the price. Generally it's quite expensive , but here is the ""game"" : negociation, if you manage it well you can have it for 25% of the first price announced ! (A saler wanted to sell me a shirt for 48 000 won, I got it for 20 000).A good experience to do, but not for me, I prefer to see stable prices."
Overpriced goods,"Got coerced into getting a t-shirt for 20,000 won. Saw the same shirt going for much cheaper at Migliore Myeongdong. Don't believe the hype about low prices. I believe prices have risen thanks to the increasing popularity of the place."
Not cheap and limited size,"I always heard of must visit dongdaemun when u r in Seoul. Varities of cheap and affordable clothes.. Varities of clothes is true, but not cheap.. And the size is very limited"
A whole sale fashion mall for ladies and men n toddlers,"There were 5 stories top 2 were men fashions,1st-3rd were mostly women and B1 were babies and toddlers.Don't be afraid to ask for discounts as its a wholesale mall after all. The more pieces u buy the more discount u get.It's opened until pretty late or early in the morning!!"
Trendy shopping mall,"Love every moment there. They have a sale going on, which was brilliant. There are many different local designers that was featured in that place, and is definitely worth a trip there if you are fashion conscious, or have teenagers in tow. "
Bought souvenirs!!,Visited this place as it was the part of culture transit tour. Nice place to shop for souvenirs. Bought some key chains and socks. Bargaining is little hard. Prefers cash as some of them do not have POS machines.
Its alright,"Each mall contains the same style of clothes (small kiosks like), theres so much stall of the same type of collections makes me feel Ive been entering the same shopping mall. Koreans don't have the habit of bargaining so most items you see are pretty fixed unless you can kindly ask for a discount. Theres a lot of nearby skincare shop that are similar to (the body shop, bath and body works etc) which are pretty affordable and dirt cheap compare back in North America. "
Good but not my taste!,"The whole are in and around is very famous for shopping, again its not a cheap bargain and size is all for tiny people!!"
so many beautiful things here!,"its easy to go there by bus, or taxi.and when u reach there...its shopping time!so much pretty clothes and others. also when i get there there's a cover dance performances in front of it. yeaay.so dont forget to bring everything u need, to embrace the moment here.if u get tired, there's a coffee shop next to it."
Midnight shopping,"OMG despite what people say, (overpriced cheap stuffs etc.), I love the place! For me, all the garments that i bought there were within reasonable price. I stayed at the mall from midnight until 4am. The outside of the mall was still packed with people (koreans mostly) although it was 4am. The coffeebeans was still opened. Taxis everywhere. Or if you don't want to take a cab, wait until the first train at 5.30am. I went there on a Saturday night."
Shopping!!,Love shopping here!! I usually spend several days in a row here because there is so much to see and buy!
amazing collection,"It was great fun shopping at migliore as you can find everything there shoes, accessories, clothing, bags etc. Trying clothes is a problem there so one should have an idea about their sizes. you get designer and all big brands quality stuff there, i have told all my friends to visit there is a must"
Great shopping BUT,"But they are very pushy. My mum bought a ₩225000 ""leather"" jacket but i think we may have been ripped off lol anyway apart from the ultrrraaa ultra pushy retailers shopping is decent. Cash=discount and they speak some english. Affordable shopping though. More for young people. "
"Not amazing, but not bad for late night shopping","Not a place to go if you want anything somewhat high-end (or low-end..), but is a good place to spend your time at 3am if you are jetlagged and slept for 8 hours of the evening... Come ready to negotiate and never pay the original price. They'll usually drop it 10% before you even ask for a price. Once you've been here, no point in going to any of the other shopping complexes as they are pretty much identical."
It's Ok But Keep In Mind You Might Pay More For The Same Item,"As other reviewers have noted, this is the place for late, late shopping! I feel this fashion house is more on the lower end side and the prices aren't always the cheapest as other vendors might sell the same item. So, if you see something, have an idea what you want to pay and don't buy it at the first place you see as another vendor might sell it cheaper. Also, I felt the shopkeepers were a little pushy here and it's hard to shop in peace. If you want more variety, I highly recommend Gasan Digital Complex."
After Hours Shopping till 5am,"Our favourite place to shop after everything else has closed, cos Migliore opens till 5am in the morning. Although some find this mall a little pricier than others, we are familiar with where our favourite shops are, and keep coming back. Besides, bargaining is allowed, so we have a chance to practise our negotiation skills. There is also 1 shop in the corner near the escalator on one of the mid-floors that sells lots of Korean souvenirs and Kpop memorabilia. The shop owner is very friendly and generous with discounts, so we usually buy all our gifts here."
Take Tour Time,"If Bangkok have MBK & Platinum malls, Seoul beats them as Migliore and the one beside it are open till early morning! Lots of selections at fairly good quality and reasonable price. Although haggling for the price can be tricky at times coz others are willing to give addl discounts while others don't. The upper levels for men's wear are more lively as the male sales people are more willing to accommodate price haggling."
We came here every night!!,"believe it or not but this is our playing area as shooping start quite late and ends the morning after. This place ectually never sleeps at night and clothes are pertty cheap too. We managed to buy a few pairs worth only KRW5000 ...its heaven for toys too as the underground level is filled with Pororor's toys and they are very high in quality too.However, dont expect to bargain as most shop are fixed price."
Shop unil drop here !,Very large building that contains many shops. You can enjoy here for almost the whole day to go through all the shops inside. There are some coffee shops and food shops for you to rest & relax your legs before continue shopping.
Late Night shoppers ,If you don't have time in Seoul to shop basic and moderate stuff this area is suit your needs. You can shop in relax mode without rushing yourself to time limit. It's open from 10 pm to 5:30 am every day. 
shop after shop with similar items,"One of a few off the open-late malls in dongdaemun, it can be worth the visit if you know exactly what you want. Be careful because prices are not always cheap (do try to negotiate a lower price) and you may end up buying something for more than a shop on the street. However, with that said, there are some things you may not be able to see on the streets, so probably make your rounds in the other shopping areas before heading to Migliore (when all the other shops are closed). Also, some shops will give you a discount of thousand won or so, if you pay cash, so make sure to ask! It's worth a try!"
Okay.. If you need your shopping fix,It's okay.. Prices are actually much more expensive as compared to similar items made in korea on online website qoo10. (Eg a $25 top would be.. Less than $20 online) It's annoying to keep bargaining too because the prices are really jacked up. Didn't enjoy my time here. I would recommend edae or hongdae shopping over this place
Another Must Go mall in DDM,"Located next to APM,Migliore opens till 5am. So every night, DDM is very crowded compared to other shopping areas. It has many levels, each level cater to a different target market. There is also a queue of taxis outside the mall, so no worries even if you shop till after midnight."
Night Market in a Mall,"Overall presentation of this place is like a wholesale market.Marked price can be haggled up to 70% off. And it seems that most of their stuffs are from the same wholeseller so feel free to walk away and haggle with other retailers.Quality and design is much better than chinese mass produced products but the price is adjusted accordingly, so don't expect dirt cheap products here."
Like a night market in a building,After going around dongdaemon all the clothes will look the same. But for this place you have to haggle the prices to get something worth it
Overpriced for tourists and definitely must bargain,"Shop owners will quote you with an original price then show you a discounted price. Although they say discounted, but in my opinion they are still rather expensive compared to Bangkok and Hong Kong. The prices they offer are same or higher than online store prices.Don't worry if you don't understand Korean, they will pass you a calculator to ask you to give them a price. Things that are labelled as sale are usually the final price.Do not expect cheap things here. Visit other markets first before this."
One of the best places to shop for clothes for nice design at cheap price,"I have travelled to Seoul 5 times over the last 10 years and each time I visit this place to top up or renew my wardrobe. If you like trendy clothes and design, and not fuss with brand names, this is the place for you. Although, a lot of the design are somewhat copies of the major design houses, but most stuff have their own brands. Some of the stitching can be better however, the materials are generally quite good. Even ones I pay 4 to 5 times the value back home are of more inferior quality. However, remember to negotiate the prices, especially men's clothes because you can quite easily get ripped off otherwise. "
Bargain!,"The selections are huge, but to get a good deal, you've gotta really bargain for it. If it's not up to your desired price tag, then walk away nicely."
Haggle!,"the shops are arranged in a cluttered manner, just a small walkway in between. I felt lost whenever I tried to trace back to a particular shop, yes, fickle-mindedness when it comes to shopping! the shop keepers recognise tourists and the starting prices for clothes without price tags are all quite high, so spend some time to negotiate for a lower price and ask them nicely. the clothes are generally good in quality and do check that they are made in Korea!"
Just lots of shops - not for bargain hunters!,"A lot of hype about not much. There are floors and floors of clothes, clothes, clothes and some of the shop owners won't let you try on the clothes, so no point! If you must tick the box, pop in and out and then go to Dongdaemun traditional Market for real bargains, but get there early as this local market shuts at 6pm and after that, only the malls are open."
