Really cool exhibit of how a home worked with lots of real items,"Changwon house is not a day long thing, maybe an hour or 2. I enjoyed it and took it slow. So many really historical items. I like this kind of stuff though.It is a home from Koreas past with the tools, home, everything they would have used. Covers detail like how they heated the home."
