Rose park,"Hi I'm local here. Rose Park is one of the greatest places to visit in Samcheock. It is a park famous it's many rose. I think the admission, you don't have to make a reservation in advance. I recommend this place especially for couples.You can go to rose park using a taxi. You can simply take a cab, and it takes 10 minutes to get here from the terminal. Also, it takes about 3,000 sons for service. There aren't have near by restaurant In addition, there is river in front of rose park. 장미공원에는 정말 많은 장미들이 있습니다 제가 생각하기에 장미공원을 걷다보면 분명 좋은 추억을 쌓을 수 있을 것입니다."
"Great fun, but silly hours","I did this with my friend in the pouring rain in October and had a blast, so I knew I had to come again in the spring with my mom.We arrived at 11:25am to find the ticket office closed for lunch. The office was to open again at 12pm and bikes starting at 1pm. Why would you close a very popular tourist attraction for 2 hours in the middle of the day? We nearly missed being able to do this because we were told there were no bikes until 3pm, but when we asked 20 min later there was one available for the 1pm departure.Information on the bike is difficult to find in English (even Chrome can't translate the webpage).Overall we had a great time, but it impacted our schedule for the day greatly."
A very nice ride,A really pleasant ride along the coast and through a few tunnels. The bikes are on a rail (obviously) so you can only go as fast as the car in front of yours. So this can slow things down quite a bit. 
Highly Recommended!,Travelling with a friend. It was a 5.4km of cycling but the view and everything was worth the money and cycling!Better reserve the seats early during peak time but youre gonna need someone who knows Korean. Go to the tourist center to help you make the reservation!Suitable for people who love nice views while exercising (:
Riding Railbikes on the Beautiful Senic East Coast,This a fun family bonding experience that anyone can enjoy. You will bike close to the coast with the view of the gorgeous east coast sea and cliffs and totally relax and have a fun experience.
Fun Ride,"It was a fun and relaxing ride with a view. The ride started on time as scheduled. The sea view was beautiful and riding in the tunnels was exhilarating with the lights/music. With so much to see, we didn't really feel that the distance was long or an issue. In no time, we reached the end.However, a word of caution to be careful of your belongings during riding. I hung my expensive Rayban sunglasses on my shirt but it dropped off in the midst of my excitement and photo taking. The only sad memory of this trip. Sob!"
Beauiful ride,"This was a chilled out ride with some pretty, weird and wacky sightings. It's a totally unique experience, and I'm glad we gave it a go."
Rail biking with our family along the blue coast of East Sea,"Last time we could not enjoy the rail bike as we did not make a reservation in advance. This time we could make a reservation luckily even though we tried the reservation 3 days before.As the course is located along the coast of East sea, the scene is wonderful and we also encounter some tunnels. As it was Summer, we tried the 1st time in the morning.The rail biking with all the family together with a stunning coast view is fun and memorable. Please keep in mind that you should make a reservation in advance on the internet site."
Awesome fun ride..,I went with my family. We have passed couple of tunnels in the whole 5.4km ride.. the tunnels are filled with patterned lightingz.. kid enjoyed it. There was 7 minutes break during the ride..Overall it took an hour for to complete the rail biking event. Online ticket booking is also possible.
A Good Work-out with a Scenic View,"Inviting view of the ocean while on the rail bike. Be prepared to pedal and sweat (during summer), good combination of tour and work out. Ladies, I don't recommend being on maxi dresses or long skirts if nobody is going to pedal the bike for you, thanks to my husband he was prepared. A good experience though, a must try!"
Very cool,"This was a really interesting thing to do while visiting Samcheok. I wouldn't travel all the way over there just for this, but if you're in the area, this is really very cool, especially if you're traveling with a group. The rail is pretty long and there are some nice tunnels along the way, plus a short break stop to use the restroom or grab a quick refreshment. Well worth it!"
