A fun aquarium with plenty to do,Like all aquariums this had a wide range of sealife but it seemed more lively with children's show and feeding times etc. It is well laid out and a lot of fun
Below Average,To me this aquarium was quite disappointing. The interior is very cheesy. Almost everything is catered towards kids. Most tanks are bare minimum with very few corals for example or a lot of artificial decoration. At the exit the staff asked me to rate everything with an excellent score which is ridiculous.If you consider this a family trip and have small kids it might be fun. If you are an adult and aquarium enthusiast you better not visit.
"As aquariums go, this is average","Some of the exhibits are excellently put forward, but most are done for the young to like. Over 75% are children orientated. If you are an aquarium enthusiast, and over the age of 18. I would say save your money. "
Shockingly bad - a tacky theme park not an aquarium,"This is not the place to go to learn about the wonderful, fascinating, astounding life of sea creatures. This is a tacky theme park pandering to the most base instincts of people with an interest in only one kind of animal...themselves. The beautiful fish here are entirely, completely overshadowed by garish, over-powering displays and interactive gimmicks that scream just one message loud and clear: these creatures cannot possibly be interesting to visitors. No: to interest you, we must give you interactive nonsense where you can pose as penguins, dress up in animal hats, sit on swings pretending to be in the fish tanks and serve you a grumpy looking human mermaid swimming among fish. Everything here diminished the sea creatures and signaled that they must be supremely boring; instead visitors must be entertained in the most banal and crass way imaginable. What must this be teaching impressionable young children? That only by posing with a selfie stick or videoing themselves as the star attraction are they truly alive? My son and I watched open-jawed as young children directly in front of tanks and displays failed to look even once directly at the animals; instead they watched them only through the screens on their mobile phones and fir just a second or two, pressed record and moved on. Neither their parents nor their teachers - nor the aquarium staff - encouraged them to find out about the habits or behaviors of the fish and sea life. There was decent written information available - but instead of being steered properly to look at it, they were instead served up mermaids and selfie opportunities. And to add insult, all this was hypocritically couched in virtue-signaling statements about ‘missions’ and ‘saving the planet’; by people who seemed not to give a fig about the actual beauty of the exhibits. My advice: don’t allow mobiles to be turned on in the aquarium. Bring in an expert - someone who actually likes and knows about animals - to talk about them. Don’t create an environment that deliberately hypes up and over stimulates the children - and the adults - but create a calm, quiet contemplative atmosphere where people can start to learn to watch without laser lights, screens and video trickery. Of course, in our society, there is no hope for any of this. But shame on Busan Aquarium for encouraging the worst in people rather than leading by example."
Good aquarium ,This aquarium is located right on the main beach and very easy to find it. A family place where you can entertain everyone.
Sad little place ,"Quite a sad excuse for an aquarium. It has plenty of species, and some of the tanks are well put together, but the larger tanks are nowhere large enough for the sharks housed there. It’s also very overpriced. Very disappointing indeed "
Great for Korean children,"The aquarium is quite big and houses a lot of different species, but if you've been to any of the European aquariums, e.g. the one in Barcelona, you won't be that impressed. The interactive features there are all in Korean but international children might be able to enjoy them too especially the technological entertainment. The space is pretty crammed and loud."
Very first time in Sea life Busan Aquarium,One of the most impresssive Aquarium I have ever visited. It would be quite suitable with parents with kids or group of friends or couples. Many undersea unique species would make you feel joyful and amazing. I highly recommend to visit aroud 5.30 pm everyday so that you can get chance to enjoy a mini-show in front of deep reef tank held at 5.30 pm daily. You would need to line up 30 minutes before the show to account for a good seat. 
"If you like Sealife, Go here!","We went later in the day towards closing, so we missed all the shows/extra stuff to do. But walking the aquarium alone was great. Well set up and laid out. Went through 3 levels of nicely set up aquariums with various species with explanations. There were many hands on areas for kids and lots of photo opportunities. There's a place where you can go out on a boat over the biggest main shark tank which would be amazing. We didn't because it was too late. But the crowning awesomeness was the underwater tunnel and main tank with some 8 sharks of a couple species, giant fish, stingrays, a couple manta rays I believe. And a turtle. All freemoving ""around"" you. It was mesmerizing and awesome to watch. Great for kids and well laid out. Highly recommend."
Aquarium,Not impressed at all..have been to many much nicer and bigger aquariums...what kind of aquarium has a fashion section? Really crowded and Koreans are just rude and run over your feet with strollers and consrantly run into you amd don't even acknowledge it
Conveniently located aquarium..,"I am giving this aquarium a 4 star because there wasn’t a big whale shark like Osaka’s aquarium. Other than that, it is definitely a place to go if you are bringing family. It has all the essentials of an aquarium and there are pretty spots for photo opportunities. Conveniently located near Haeundae Beach and the shopping area nearby, plan your trip here wisely. You can easily spend half a day here or more. There are some hotels located nearby and subway is at the end of the road. "
Convenient place,"We went to the sand festival right on Haeundae beach. The Sand festival was so disappointing that we decided to go to the Aquarium just to have more to do. The Aquarium is right on the beach so if you’re already there, you don’t need to drive further. However, it is expensive, look for a coupon if you’re planning to go. It’s very pretty and mostly underground so it’s a nice place to escape the beach heat. Wouldn’t drive there just for it, I have seen better aquariums but the kids are easy to please and they did enjoy it. "
Excellent quaint aquarium but still educational and interactive...,"Was here when it just opened, middle of work week so I had the place all to myself. Very interesting take on sea life education. Very helpful and friendly staff. I also enjoyed the interactive exhibits, even the passport stamps! I had fun! As a bonus, this attraction is along Haeundae Beach. That's definitely the cherry on top of the cake!"
"Very nice, not too big sea life","Nice, not too big, just for small trip with family. Something to play for children. Interesting way to show the fish. Nearby sea and beach. Not expensive. Just for 1h walk. Gift shop, restaurants, restrooms. All what you need. "
So much fun!,"Right in Haeundae Beach, Sea life is an underground aquarium, entry fees are about 15$.Features so many different sea critters and fish, even got to take a selfie with a sting ray!There is a glass tunnel that cross the sharks' tank, you can see them up close! So close I took a picture of their teeths!Some tanks have ""walkable"" spots, glass windows on the ground and it feels like walking on the water with sting rays swimming right under your feets! "
Very nice aquarium,"We were staying on Haeundae Beach and the aquarium was within walking distance. This was an activity I had planned to do with our two teenage girls while my husband was working. It's not much to look at from the outside and we almost decided against doing it, but we had the day to explore and decided to do it. We received a discount because we arrived early (before 11am). It was crowded with alot of students from lower schools, but we thought they were all adorable in their little school uniforms. We were not disappointed and really enjoyed the aquarium."
Small and boring aquarium ,"Bought tickets through Klook but really regretted even though it is cheaper than buying through counter. It is small and probably meant for parents with very young kids. Some of the feeding shows do not have proper seats and small space, thus people standing behind or young kids will need to ride on their fathers' shoulders in order to watch the feeding shows. This is probably one of the smallest and most boring aquarium that I had visited so far."
Amazing aquarium ,This one ranks up there with Georgia Aquarium and Sea World in terms of fun activities for the kiddos. Our son loves fish and he had a great time. Lots of activities and interesting shows. 
Nice Aquarium with a little extra,Nice aquarium in an original setting. Although I have questions if the well being of (some) fishes is important for the management. (f.e. you are allowed to touch some fishes). Entrance price is quiet high.
Nice place for Kids,Our kids loved the aquarium and a good place for a rainy day in Busan. Small kids could easily see the fishes and play in the different activities in the aquarium. Good location and nice beach close to the museum.
Great Afternoon Activity,"My partner and I really enjoyed our visit to the aquarium. It was larger than we expected. All of the animals look well-cared for and placed in appropriately-sized tanks. It was clean and all of the staff were very friendly. I bought the virtual reality tickets, and even though they were only 4,000 each, I would say that I would suggest a hard pass on that part of the aquarium. It wasn't that great, or worth the small line we had to wait in. It was better to just enjoy the real fish all around us. I would recommend visiting the SEA LIFE Aquarium to people visiting Busan."
Nice place to visit with kids,It’s good place for kids to visit sea life but pretty small inside so we recommend visit here on week day or low season.
Perfect for family with young children ,"We spent an hour there. My daughter really enjoyed the place. The entrance fee is pretty high, but this time it was included in the package tickets we bought for the BOF opening concert."
Not much to see,"Bought tickets via Klook it was simple easy with free VR (5mins). It was very easy to spot - Big Signage “SEA LIFE”. It’s not expensive but debatable if it’s worth it. The place is narrow and small comparable to other Aquarium but the main Aquarium is fun to watch. Sharks swam extremely near to the glass which was really fun. Take note for feeding time. Souvenir toys are overpriced- KRW20,000 each. "
Under the beach ,It’s all underground with small entrance that you’ll be shocked once you go down and see all fish and marine life 
Great Experience!,"Nice selection of fish, enjoyed watching them feed the penguins and the sharks! Pretty neat to see and touch some starfish and shells!. Neat to see the shells move around!"
Great for children,Great aquarium for children and if you're looking for something to do around the Haeundae area in Busan. It's one of the smaller aquariums I've been to but still has great sea lives.
"Nice, but expensive","A nice escape from the heat, if you're looking for one. It has nothing you cannot find in a regular zoo though, so it was a bit expensive in my opinion.Exit 5 or 7 from Haeundae Station and walk straight in the direction of the beach."
Excellent aquarium and worth a visit,"The entrance fees are 29,000 Won for an adult and some add-ons such as glass bottom boat tours are available at additional charges inside. The aquarium has a huge variety of fishes and aquatic animals. There are a large number of sting rays and sharks, which can be viewed from walk though pools and tanks. They also allow the kids to get a feel of some marine animals such as star fish, oyster etc., by taking it in their hands. An enjoyable time and great place for the kids."
Worth a visit. No regret.,"The price is 29,000won for 1 adult, 23,000 for a child, if there are 3 foreigners then 1 ticket is free, show them your passport. Open until 19:00, located right at Haeundae so very convenient. I love the space so much I will definitely comeback, even though I am an adult. Drop by the place when you come to Busan. We saw amazingly huge fish and hang out with some stingrays. I think one shark really liked me."
Great Aquarium ,This is a very nice aquarium with a lot of things to see . Very close to Novotel Hotel . Nice informative place for all with very nice staff .
Very interesting Aquarium,"Very interesting Aquarium, with big different sectors, large pool that you can travel by small boats, live events and happenings."
Enjoyed!,It was raining most of the time we were in Busan so this was a great indoor activity. My family and I enjoyed seeing the sea life and the shark and stingray feedings. Get discounted tickets online to save money. 
Nice variety of animals,"Though it's quite small, there was a huge aquarium at the end which had big sharks, turtles and rays which was amazing. I also loved the jellyfish section. Great place for kids and good english signage which was fascinating to read about. A bit pricey but a fun way to spend a rainy day."
Great!,My husband and I had a great time exploring this museum. The best part was they had sea life that we have never witnessed in the U.S. before. Extremely clean and fun! They have signs in English. My favorite part was the spotted hallway and the sea worms!
Nice Aquarium,"Pretty straight forward aquarium. I recommend going after 4pm during the weekday. Price for two people was 29,000₩."
Fun and interesting aquarium ,"We visited this place before exploring Haeundae Beach. It’s a fun and interesting aquarium with lots to see for everyone. The staff are friendly and they have a nice touch pool area bound to please kids. They also featured a short mermaid show which will fascinate kids, abit boring for adults. Won’t hesitate to bring kids here! "
"The Aquarium is nice, the views around it are just as nice if not better",This is a really nice aquarium. The thing that sticks out the most are the beautiful beach photos we got right outside! Take a nice camera and stroll around Busan for great food and scenery.
Sweet place,"Went here with my cousins, the aquarium was nice with many varieties fish .Not too big but was ok "
Waited in Line,"I waited in line around noon for about 1 hour and didn't make much progress. I would suggest going early in the morning to prevent long line up especially on weekends. But from what I have heard, it is really awesome inside and Busan is a great city! Good luck getting in!"
More enjoyable for the little ones,"We went as a family, with children range from 6 months to 13 years old. Our 3 children aged below 10, enjoyed it more than the other two. But a very conveniently accessible attraction if you're staying near Heundae beach!"
Overpriced,"Their collection is ok but compared to other aquarium/ zoo i've been, i think it is overpriced because it is smaller. The way they showcase/ display the marine animals are nice"
Small and uninteresting,"Compared to other SEA LIFE Aquariums, this one in Busan is pretty small. It had all the usual displays and exhibits and nothing much else. Was a little disappointed as the tickets weren't cheap. Accessibility is quite ok as you can take the subway but will need to walk for about 10 minutes to get there. If you have been to other Aquariums, I suggest you give this one a miss and save your money."
Fun,Small fun place to visit. Little pricey but still worth a look. Clean facilities were a plus. Exhibits were interesting.
"Nice aquarium, good for kids","Wisited in the morning so there was not big crowd. aquarium is full with animations and including an interactive ocean shoreline where you can walk into the water that isn't really there. Took me 30-40 min to see all, various fish can be seen, some sharks and penguins. Not overpriced, and good to spent some time with family. sound sistem was great."
Nice but small Aquarium,"This aquarium is very nice with loads of animation including an interactive ocean shoreline where you can walk into the water that isn't really there, as well as touch screens where the computerized fish on the screen will bite your fingers, glass walkways over the aquarium floor and shark and penguin feedings. They also have glass bottom boats that you can ride in for an additional fee. Worth a visit and doesn't take a lot of time to go through."
Busan SeaWorld Aquarium Review,"Pretty cheap admission price as far as aquariums go, definitely aimed at younger audiences though. Nice variety of fish, but nothing to the extent of dolphins or sea lions. Gift shop was also disappointing, mostly a collection of cheap stuffed animals and zero souvenirs that actually said ""Busan"" anywhere on them. Avoid this place on weekends or holidays, even in the morning it's a madhouse trying to get through."
ITU World 2017,This is one of the attractions near our hotel. It is good for spending time with children and family. Sea life is one of the tourist spot in Busan. It is full every Sat and Sunday
For the kids,"If you have young children, like lots of noise, this is for you. The sound system is blasting, and when the screams of lots of young children's groups are added ... lots of groups during our visit .... the cacophony of sound is such you cannot have a conversation or hear any announcements.There is a carnival atmosphere throughout with bold colours and brightly coloured plastic scenery. The assistants add to this with bizarre headgear and jollity. It's all a bit too much for the faint hearted.They do have a fine collection of sea creatures and a colony of penguins but any thought of meditating on their grace and beauty in quiet surroundings can be forgotten. Don't know what the fish feel about such noisy humans!It's pricey too, 29,000 won. However if you produce a two for one voucher obtained from Emart in the resort when you spend 30,000 won in the store .... easy to do when on holiday .... this reduces the price by half and in my opinion that is a better reflection of the value of a visit.The sea aquarium at Monterey Calif. is still my favourite aquarium by far, more educational, better hands on experience and noise free."
A Sight Worth Seeing!!,"We took our 2 year old here and she loved every second of it. They have a interactive fish area, where you can touch live animals. The have mermaid shows and feeding times so you can watch anything from otters to sharks to Paranas eat. Truly wonderful trip. "
Awesome aquarium for the price,"I believe I paid 29,000 wan for a ticket. The displays and aquariums were nicely taken care of and had a great selection of ocean life. I also bought the glass bottom boat tour for 7,000 wan, that was money completely wasted. The plexi-glass on the bottom of the boats is so scratched up it is no good for pictures at all. Save your money and just enjoy seeing all the sharks and rays in the tunnels after you pass the glass bottom boats."
Noisy!!!,"Everyone told me this is a 'must see', but I found it a bit disappointing. It feels more like a noisy theme park experience. I don't understand why you need loud music to accompany observing fish and sea creatures. A tour guide was explaining to her group using a loud voice (amplified) in order to be heard over the already loud music. I think it is a lot of fun for small kids, as they add to the noise as well. I recorded between 80 and 90 dB (which is the sound you experience next to a freeway). We completed the whole aquarium in about one hour. Please note that you can download a discount voucher for foreign tourists."
Surprisingly Good,"I love aquariums and the best in the world, for me, is the Monterey Bay. While the Busan version is not Monterey, this one was surprisingly interesting, interactive, and geared to the little ones. Had it been not so crowded, I would have enjoyed it more. It's an underground, sprawling place that's pretty small, and the place was packed with kids and strollers the size of Cadillacs as well as their parents and me. The theme of the aquarium is ""the sea at night."" So everything is dimly lit, fittingly so since it's underground and there's no natural light.. There's a 9 ""stations"" for kids to get stamps, an interactive ""petting"" area, and regular feeding times. There's an auditorium and a virtual reality experience. The place is geared to teaching and learning about marine life, and it's a marine rescue site. Especially if you have kids, this is a great experience. It cost 29000 for adults but my concierge gave me a 30% off coupon."
Exciting and educational,"Nice aquarium located near Haeundae Beach. Has fantastic displays and walking over and next to the glass tanks with fish, dolphins, sea life, sharks etc was a highlight. Visited here with my partner in summer- July 2014."
Very Cool!,"This is a fun vacation spot! Lots of levels and things to see. I would skip out on the glass bottom boat ride though, not worth it and extremely hot "
Great idea for a rainy day in Busan ,Our son is 5 and he loved spending the afternoon here. The place was a bit pricey but the number of animals they are taking care of makes it worth the cost. We will return. 
Average aquarium,"I have been to SEA in SIngapore before, so felt nothing exciting here. Felt that they focus more on lighting. Kids may find it exciting."
Smaller than Singapore but roughly good,"This is in haeundae beach, on th beach. I went to Singapore aquarium, here is a smaller than there but they have a really beautiful fish. If you have a time visit it"
Attraction for families,"The aquarium is more for families, where parents can bring their children along and teach them about the different species of sea life. Furthermore, they can get to see sharks, turtles, stingrays, etc, almost up close and personal.We visited the aquarium in the late afternoon, and by then, there weren't many visitors. Thus, if you do not want to squeeze with the crowd, that timing is the best. Minus point was that you'll miss out the feeding times and the show times."
Wow,"Walking with sharks , turtles , big fish , stingrays swimming around you inside a glass walk way. There is also sharks feeding activity in the aquarium."
Huge Sea life,If going to Busan this is a must see! The tanks are huge. You walk through a tunnel where the sharks are swimming over you. You can see their gills pulsing. It was amazing and must see. Various games to play to find the different fish.
Great for families! ,"We have been many times! Has toilet, nappy change facilities. Also has a jungle gym for young children to play for a while. The aquarium has a 'touch' area of star fish etc. A lovely spot to visit! "
A nice aquarium to bring the kids though not very big.,"As it was raining, we decided to choose an indoor location to spend the morning, and what better place to go than the aquarium that is right next to our hotel? Turned out we had a good leisurely morning spent at the aquarium. Watching the fish Swimming around really has a calming effect on us. our 3-year-old thoroughly enjoyed it and we were quite impressed with each the interactive activities and media that is well positioned around the aquarium to keep children entertained.Though not very big, as compared to Singapore's S.E.A. Aquarium, the Busan's aquarium had quite a number of exotic and unusual fish so it was quite refreshing. Worth a couple of hours visit, esp if you have young children. Only feedback is that there are not toilets and eatery within the aquarium. Only when we exited the aquarium then we found the foodcourt and toilets but only a few stores were opened. So the place can possibly improve in this area to make it more vibrant."
Very small version of underworld ,"It's a very small underworld, maybe good for children education but not worth a visit and price paid . Nothing extra ordinary except selective fish in a tank and light effect."
A good aquarium,"We went late in the afternoon, but got to see the feeding of the stingrays which was very interesting, though crowded. There were other shows listed for various exhibits throughout the day.it was rather humid and a bit stuffy, but otherwise good. there are a lot of interesting things to see for both adults and children."
Very nice,Very nice aquarium. Not to expensive with lots to see. Great exhibits. Can get very crowded during the weekend.
Good indoor activity in Haeundae for kids ,"It was raining and we can't enjoy the beach. Luckily this place is just there, at Haeundae beach, and as foreigner they give promotion price (must ask!).The staff help me to their website to find 30% off. Original price adult 29,000 and kids 23,000 won.They have some sections and kids enjoy collecting stamps! The free stamp book was given at the ticket desk. If you collect all stamp, show it to the staff at the souvenir shop to receive free badge.Careful! Parking lot was not free even if you visited the aquarium. 1000/30 mins."
有趣的互動水族館 an interesting interactive aquarium ,"雖然規模不大，但非常有韓國自己可愛又華麗的特色，除了有非常多的秀可以參與，互動性的遊戲讓大人都玩得很開心，我們在企鵝區玩了非常久，遊戲之餘也包含海洋保育的概念，各區也有特別的浮水印集點供收集，淡季遊客不多時過來可以玩得很盡興！就在海雲台海水浴場旁，交通十分方便！Though it's not big, but has it's very own Korean style! Many shows and interactive features, everybody can have fun here. We spent many time at the penguin zone. A nice place to visit when you're in Haeundae."
A Great Activity Spot in Busan,"Easy to reach, well-priced, and quite abundant of sea life.A great place to spend time especially if the Haeundae Beach nearby is too crowded."
Great spot!,"Ask your hotel for discount coupons, ours gave us a 30% coupon! For two adults it was roughly 40,000 won after discount. The entire aquarium is underground, which is kind of cool when you think about it. Very child friendly. They even had a touch pool with shark eggs inside!"
Great views of marine life,"Every aquarium has to show you the creatures of the sea in an escalating level of amazement. The Haeundae aquarium does the job well. It includes many varieties of fish, medusae, turtles, even piranha (which are not sea creatures, but when they are at rest are marvelous), and of course sharks and other wonderful elasmobranchii creatures. Nice for all ages."
Sea life! ,"Hello, I've visited couple of aquariums in my life but honestly this one was great! It great activity for couples,families,friends... i really enjoyed it. U can take many pictures and almost every fish has its little education lable so u get to know many new infos. It very interesting to see sea life and its also in good location = close to beach and shopping location. I recommend it. "
worst experience in Busan,"I booked a diving with the sharks, I rearranged my trip to be in Busan the 20th of November for the diving as we had agreed. The day before I was already in Busan and I asked somebody to call the aquarium for clarificate some details and they just told me that the diving was cancelled because was low season. Thats very unprofesional, actually I am happy that they cancelled it because I wouldn't trust them to dive together.Really disapointing, unprofessional, unrespectful and the worst experience in my travel"
Depressing & Stuffy,"The sea life seemed to be put into very small and dirty water tanks and did not seem to be enjoying themselves, I travelled in a large group and some of the members were quite angry and upset. I don't think I would go back there again"
A nice aquarium,"The aquarium has a nice selection of different marine life including turtles, rays and sharks. It was on the expensive side (25,000￦ for one person) considering you could probably only spend a max of 2 hours there. The tunnels through the tanks were pretty cool though."
Fabulous & Fun,What a great place to visit! We really enjoyed looking at the amazing variety of marine creatures and fish on display. Very educational with a great emphasis on rescue and release! Lots of photo opportunities and very reasonably priced entry fee. A must see if you are in Busan:))
A Place Which Can Make You as Excited as A Kid,"This place really makes me excitinggggg! Aquariums are beautiful and it's colorful inside. There are so many kind of animals that i never see. Like many kind of jellyfish and there are an animal called grass ell. You should visit this place.And yes, there's an attraction or whatever its name, where you can get on a boat and strolling inside aquarium, and you can see fish, sharks, and many animals swimming under you. But i don't really recommend it beacuse the guide only speaks korean. Such a pity.Overall, just visit this aquarium!"
Nice place when it's cold outside,"A good place when the weather is sad, & when it's not crowded. We spent a good 1hour 1/2 there. Everything is perfectly organize. A nice aquarium. Price is not cheap !"
Something fishy,Not the biggest or best aquarium I've been to but some good exhibits and nice big tanks. Loved the rays and the different jelly fish and sea horses. Not a lot of English signage although the guide leaflet is available in English. There is a glass bottom boat across the top of the shark tank which looked fun - if short- activity. There's also a 4d movie for extra fee.
A bit boring,"Not really a lot in here but smaller fish and jellyfish, there are the larger sting rays sharks and turtles but that's it really, the penguin enclosure very small no wales or dolphins very quick to get around."
Good Aquarium,"The forecast was for heavy rainfall and strong winds so my wife and I visited the aquarium to avoid the weather. It is a very neat and organized aquarium with lots to see and discover. I didn't learn much because of not being able to read the signs but it was over all enjoyable. Highlights were the shark feeding, penguins, many underwater tunnels and displays. It looks like a great place for children to explore too. They also have a glass bottom boat and diving with sharks experience which looked very interesting but pricey. "
"Pricey, but nice","It's not very big so you won't need more than 1h to see it unless you will wait for all extra activities. At 26000 won + 7000 for the glass bottom boat, I would expect a bit more. But the penguins and the sharks are there, the tunnel is nice, so it's a nice experience especially on a rainy day.Tip: foreigners can get the 30% discount voucher at the tourism office next door."
Nice but smaller.,"I've been to many aquariums around the world and this one I would say is above average and has what most others have. I'd say most aquariums are the same. I think I paid W20,000. I blew threw the place in 40 minutes with my girlfriend. I'm sure kids would enjoy this place."
Busan Aquarium,We went there for a second already and used the rainy day. It is a nice Aquarium wna dthe Kids loved very much. Big and small fishes around the world. Staff was friendly and i did not find anything to complain. You can make in between a Picture and later at the Souvenir shop make your self with different back grounds. Entry fee is 24k for adult and 16k for children. There is also a 4D Cinema at the end.
Busan Aquarium,Nice acuarium. It's not better than the one in Atlanta and I'm sure isn't better than the one in Okinawa either but it's worth a visit while in Busan
Good place for kids,"It's an average aquarium. Kids enjoyed watching the sea creatures. It opens during Chusoek. During Chusoek, it's advisable to go one day before or on Chusoek as it's not so crowded since most will be staying home for family gathering. "
Average,The aquarium is quite average in comparison to the aquarium we saw in Seoul. There are very few exhibits and no explanation in English. The glass bottom boat ride is not worth the 7000KRW as you don't see any different from what you see from outside. They are doing some conservation and rehabilitation work in the aquarium but I wish they had aim explanation in English. Overall below expectation but could be a good option for a rainy day. Do look for the 30% discount coupon on visit Korea website.
"Good for a Hot Day, and its open on Chuseok`","Another of my Chuseok visit site, before going do print out their 30% discount voucher for foreigners in their website, They have lotsa sea creatures and quite entertaining. Yet, during pack hours, holidays esp chuseok, its might be a bit tight to go about in the crowds, especially mostly children. The Aquarium is underground and is situated straight on the T junction down the road towards Haeyundai Beach from the Metro Station. Its building in underground going into the beach, which is very cooling for a hot day. Kids will love it."
Just amazing!,"The scale and variety of the aquarium is just breathtaking. I must say one cannot see the same think anywhere else in the world.Although it's a bit remote in location, definitely worth the trip. A must go in Okinawa!"
Okay,"We went to Busan for a beach weekend getaway, but unfortunately it rained the entire time making us change our itinerary. We ended up at the SEA Life Aquarium to escape the downpour. It was SO packed with people, and extremely warm inside. I am not sure if the AC wasn't working or if the amount of people inside made it so hot. I have been to plenty of aquariums, and although this has some good qualities, it's a bit overpriced for what it is. It is nice that they give you a booklet to collect stamps around the aquarium which made it more exciting for our daughter. "
Aquarium,A very well maintained moderate sized aquarium. Pleasant staff and a large variety of fish. Very good for all ages.
Average ,"Ok to visit if you are bored with the beach . Worth going. There is entry fee, kids will enjoy.the place is well maintain and clean"
Surprisingly nice aquarium,"Its all underground and super family friendly. So if its raining or wicked hot and you wanna do something cool in Busan, without having to be outside, check it out."
Fantastic aquarium.,"I've been to many aquarium and I will give this one 4 and half star. Remember to get discounts otherwise it's not so cheap. We payed 20,20, and 10. 50 for 3 people. They had what other aquarium has plus some sea thru bottom glass along with a boat u can ride for 7000. U get to see some sea creatures top view from the boat and get to feed them with little shrimps. Imo it's not worth $7 to do it. "
Mom&kids vacay,Reasonable priced place . Wished the shows were also translated into english. The shark exhibit was super cool. It is a must for a change of pace while needing a day off from the beach. My kids both young and teens enjoyed it. 
Incredible! My first experience swimming with sharks!,Yes! They will actually let you scuba dive with the sharks here after a short class which i got to skip because I am an instructor. Amazing experience. My X-Girlfriend had no diving experience diving but was very enthusiastic and had an unforgettable time. also many other exquisite exhibits.
Overpriced,Nice aquarium but it was kind of small and it was overpriced for what they offered. The staff was friendly and very helpful though.
Great outing for sealife lover,Well decorated indoor aquarium. Very exciting places for sea life lover. Almost same as in KLCC Aquaria in Malaysia. Recommended for all ages. Souvenir also very attractive. It is a great outing place even during rainy day.
Look online for coupons,"Large aquarium with a great 4D ride. I'm not sure how much parking is. There's a few restaurants in the basement.. Popeye's, Lotteria, Baskin Robins. A very nice experience for all ages. "
Great place to bring the kids!,Informative and exciting place for the kids. Similar to what I have seen in KLCC Aquaria (Msia) and in Siam Paragon (Bangkok). There are live shows at allocated hours of the day i.e feeding of fish/penguins etc. Also they give you a little booklet at the entrance and you can 'hunt' for the stamping machine to collect all 7/8 'stamps' as you tour the whole area. My son made me run all the way back to the beginning for missing 1 stamp! 
Great family outing on a rainy day,"It was well decorated and small indoor aquarium. There were many people due to rainy but it was manageable. The place was clean and cute but difficult to go around if you have wheel chair. Glass bottom boat was fully overrated. They just go within a tank where there is shark. It wasn't really a boat but rather floating raft, pulled by a rope. The entire place was loud and no place to rest during the visit."
Rainy day fun with friends. ,My Friends and I decided to stop in the aquarium to check out the exhibit because it was raining. I think it was a pretty good time considering the venue was very tourist oriented. They were activities for families and children. It was also nice because it contributes to the wildlife conservation efforts. That's not half bad…
Good Aquarium ,"It was 26,000 won per adult to get in. The aquarium was well kept and nice and clean. Go on a weekday when it's not as crowded. We also did the glass bottom boat for 7,000 won and it was cool. The shark exhibit was probably one of the nicer big shark exhibits."
Average nothing to shout about,"This is next to the Haeundae Beach, and very strategic if you are stay at the hotel across the street. Price : 25 000 won per person and I think if you have BUTI Tour Pass you can get discount or something. I've been to alot of Aquarium attraction, so I pretty much knew what to expect. If you haven't been to one of these, you might like it. Pros:- Staff are friendly and can understand English.- The walk-path is pretty straightforward just follow the arrows or footprint sticker - Aquariums looks clean and well maintainedCons:- Staff were not monitoring the kids or teenagers. My sis and I saw a kid tried to stick his finger in the display hole to touch the starfish and shark egg. And they didn't even do anything when the kid tried to yank one of the starfish out of the display hole!!!- A mother was caring her toddler over shorter aquarium displays so she can take pictures but still nobody stops herSuggestions:- Make sure you know when the feeding showtime is, there is no time limit for your visit (minus the closing time) so you can wait for the feeding time show."
Typical aquarium ,Nothing to shout about but still well maintain and the fishes look happy. I think it's good for children below 10 as they have many program in Korean and fish feeding activities. 
Geared for kids,"Have seen better aquariums in Asia and at home, but anything aquatic interests us. The small fish, sea dragons, sea horses and especially the jellyfish displays were excellent. Be warned though it is aimed at children, and on our visit there were hundreds of very early school year kids, and it was tremendous fun watching their reactions to the creatures. However it was noisy and any older groups might not be as cute. Substantial discount vouchers are a bonus. Ours was available at our accommodation."
Summer vacation,I highly recommend this place for travelers to Busan as a one of great attentions. I really enjoyed the wide water aquarium with lots of small fish as well as big sharks and turtles and gelly fish~
NO THANK YOU!,"The place was small, crowded, people pushing and shoving and I complained. We were here during Chinese Spring Festival and we were enjoying our trip in Korea. I am quite positive there were many Chinese tourists and I deal with that as I live in Beijing but I wasn’t going to put up with it in Korea. I asked the manager if we could have our money back. He didn’t readily agree but said he was sorry. I usually take many pics and enjoy a place even if it wasn't all that it was cracked up to be but when you have unruly and pushy tourists, the pleasure cannot be had. Avoid this place especially during Spring Festival."
Rainy day but satisfied 😊,It was great experience although it's raining but when you are in Busan aquarium you feel relax its a free of entrance also the free wifi is fast ... I love it
Great experience!,This aquarium blew my mind! Great for everyone regardless of age! You absolutely must spring the glass bottom boat experience. It is breathtaking.
Perfect for a rainy day,"It was not a good weather to stay outside, even though I love being outdoors. We went here on the late days of the stay, so we went here randomly because of the weather. But I was happily surprised of the fishes, sharks and the size of the aquarium!If you bring kids, it's perfect. For families and couples too. We strolled around and it took msybe 40 min before we finished. The sharks were my favourite.Don't go here on a sunny day though, save it for inside weather."
Nice but a bit pricey aqurium,"Probably more entertaining for small children but it was place to spend time on rainy day. A bit pricey and was smaller than I expected, I walked it trough less than an hour. All the fishes etc. seemed to be treated nicely"
Beautiful sea life creatures,"well maintained, one of the most beautiful and clean aquariums that i have been so far. there isn't anything very special about this aquarium (eg: special animals that other aquarium don't have) good for families with kids for a day out. but entrance fee is about 25,000 won - a bit pricey for a small aquarium. gift shop does not have much or very nice souvenirs either"
Sea life in Busan,"I was really excited to visit the aquarium but I ended up a little bit disappointed as it was small and there wasn't that much to actually see. The day we went was crowded with visitors, locals and tourists alike. It's an okay place if you have kids you want to bring to visit and spend an hour there. "
Kinda expect more from this aquarium,"Honestly I kinda expected more collection in this aquarium compared to other, but I found that SEA life in Singapore has more collection. Nevertheless this is a quite good place to educate children about sea and its life. "
3rd time visit,This is one of the place to visit if you don't know much about Sea Life. I showed this place to my mother. 1st time 2009 my Korean friend showed me this place. I enjoyed it. 2nd time 2012 I showed my Mongolian friend. He was over the moon.This time showed my mother. She was very happy.
Busan aquarium,It's the biggest aquarium in korea.It's just beside the haeundae beach.It's convenient. I think it's awesome.I will visit here again.
Good attraction for family,"It's always a good activity to travel Aquarium with kids, this aquarium worth a visit too. It's not crowded during my visit on a weekday afternoon.One of the highlight from me is a playroom for children, parents can sit down and relax for half an hour. The feeding time should be a great performance but I missed.They provide the shark diving and the glass bottom boat to view or feed the shark at close. These 2 activities are very interesting too but I didn't paid the extra money.Remember to surf their website before visit there, check for the penguin and the shark feeding time. And you may able to get some offers from the website."
"Same old franchise, not worth price","While Sea Life aquariums are always very nice and well done, this one is very small and overpriced. Still a good activity for the family. They first charge you entrance, but then throw extras at you along the way through. Selling photo opportunities, glass bottom boats of the same fish you look at from the side of the tanks. The one thing I don't mind them selling extra is the swim with the Sharks experience.To get your money's worth, be sure to watch the presentations and feeding scheduled throughout the day.When you are finished, there is a food court and dessert places available before exiting back up to the beach.All in all, it's an overpriced short tour of all the fish you've seen before that kills time but the kids will enjoy."
Great Aquarium,We enjoyed our visit to the Busan Aquarium. There is a lot to see and walking through the tube where the sharks swim makes for a great experience.
Don't Miss it,"Really cool attraction in Pusan. It is not the largest aquarium I have been to, but has some incredible high lights. For example, there is a tank you can walk through where the sharks are able to swim around and directly over you. It was awesome. They also offer a discount if you are wearing a korean couple ring with your partner."
Excellent!,"the biggest aquarium i have visited so far, Sea Life busan aquarium has 8 themed section. A place where you can bring ur children to visit, lots of things to see. im impressed by their shark tank, Have you ever imagine urself standing on top of shark? place where u can experience. Entrance 25,000.00won per person. Disability eligible for special discount."
Big shark tank ,This aquarium isn't very big compared to others I have been to but I had such a fun time there. There is a huge shark tank that I think you can go diving in. I took lots of great pictures but if you go it will only take like a hour or so of your time. That is of you don't watch any of the scheduled shows. 
Educational,I went here to try diving with the sharks which was an interesting experience although kind of gimmicky. It was really neat to see and learn about all the marine life though.
An interesting attraction on the beach,"SEA LIFE in Busan is right on the beach so it's a perfect location. Me and my fiancé went April last year whilst waiting for the Indian Holi Hai festival to start. It was quite expensive but I think we managed to get a discount voucher online so it's worth looking into it before you go. I found this to be quite interesting and a good time killing activity. It doesn't take long to go around the aquarium so I wouldn't call it a day out. It's right next to shops, bars and restaurants and I think a subway station too.. Great attraction for the kids!"
Jellyfish amazing,My boyfriend took me here and it was really good. Price is a bit expensive but you could see many wonderful things. Most memorable was the jellyfish because they are so beautiful. Turtlea were cute. Since we went late at night some of them were sleeping like the penguins. 
Aquarium,"One of the nest aquariums I have been in and all hidden underneath the local beach. A bit pricey, but worth it! Parking can be an issue so get there aearly, but plenty of places to eat nearby!"
Well done,"We went kind of late on a Friday evening. It was not crowded. Tanks/displays are well done, but probably would have been annoying if it was more crowded. A bit on the expensive side...25,000 won per person, but it really only took us an hour to walk through."
Fun afternoon activity,"Good for adults and children, decent prices. Clean, interactive displays throughout. Easy location right on Haeundae Beach."
Excellent Family Day Out!,As expats living in Busan we bought yearly passes to the Aquarium. We would go all the time. It was a terrific place to take our two little children. They enjoyed looking at all the different displays as well as participating in the daily shows. I would highly recommend this to a family with children or people visiting. It is a highlight of the Haeundae area.
"Nothing new (that's what an aquarium should be, right?)",Time well spent in Sea Life. Enjoy the shark tank especially. Highly recommended if you are in the city.And it's right next to the beach. You can spend 2 to 3 hours in the same area.
Family fun underwater ,A few of our families visited together. We were impressed with how well the facility was maintained and staffed. Many of the signs were in English so we could tell what we were seeing.
A nice way to spend a few hours in Busan.,My wife and I enjoyed a few hours in the Busan Aquarium on a rainy day. They have a lot of nice exhibits and I got to see some animals I have never seen before. They also have some nice exhibits and activities for kids as well. It is very clean and an enjoyable way to spend a few hours. I recommend this as something to do in Busan. It costs about $25 per person. 
Enjoyable Way To Spend An Hour Or So,"Be on the look out for discount coupons. They are many places thru out town...or even ask at your concierge desk at your hotel. It saved some nice $. It's on the trolley stop.Expect to spend about an hour or a tad longer. No new species to us at this aquarium...this certainly, is Not the Baltimore or Monterrey Aquarium. Still, a very enjoyable visit. Admission is about $18.00US."
Aquarium,A nice aquarium depicting sea life and waster creatures in a soothe img environment It is located underground and a good activity for children and first timers Located on heundae beach and reachable by metro tourist bus and local busIt is the most prominent area of busan
Nice place to visit ,"As one of the attractions of Busan , you should not miss it if you are there for more than one night . You can see from the tiny to the large and most dangerous sea creatures. At the beginning you see the normal fishes, but then it is going to be great . Though everyone might have seen aquariums in other parts of the world , it is also nice to see this place too ."
Shark feeding show is the best part,"I went around 2:30pm and saw them feed penguins and otters, but the shark feeding show was the best part. The last shark feeding show is at 4pm. Admission is about 28,000 Won but not bad compared to aquariums in most cities. It's no Atlanta, but it's still good. This was a lot more interesting and entertaining than anything else I've seen in Busan so far. The shows aren't in English but that's understandable. "
Best aquarium I've been to.,I spent five days in Busan and the highlight of the entire stay was this aquarium. It was the biggest one I've been to with plenty to see. The size of some of the tanks and the diversity of marine life was impressive. 
Really short,"My daughter is 6 she liked it but it was not very long. We were there during the shark feeding and they really got the crowd involved they did not speak English, which was ok. They have places that the kids can get their book stamped. It just was not very long. Maybe if she was younger we may not have gone through so fast. They do have a play area for the kids to play it has a trampoline and a mini zip line. "
Beautiful!,"I absolutely loved the aquarium! I tend to be weary of any animal related attractions because of the way they treat their animals, but I was really impressed and pleasantly surprised. There seemed to be a focus on conservation and there was a ton of information to keep you interested. There are nine different ""sections"" inside and you get a little booklet to stamp once you've visited each one. The best parts were the jellyfish tank, the huge octopus and of course, the tunnel, which was so impressive!A must-see if you're in the area!"
Busan Aquarium,Families can enjoy a nice day at the Sea Life Busan Aquarium. It is an easy walk throughout a clean place. The beach is right outside of the facility. 
Escape underwater,One of the best aquariums I have ever visited. You would lose all sense of time the moment you enter. There is just so much to see!
Awesome and enjoyable experience,"We thoroughly enjoyed the experience and on top of the educational part, we had have much fun and screamed as we sat through the awesome 4D dinosaur movie! Also managed to catch the feeding of the sharks while there. Had a good value meal at the food court too. All in all, it was a great experience!"
Busan Aquarium - must see while in Busan,"The weather wasn't the most cooperative when we went to Busan Beach for Labor Day weekend. So, a trip to the aquarium was a must. Thank goodness for the military discount - don't forget to ask for it. I missed the show - we waited a while - that's how come I only gave this aquarium 4 stars. The display is impressive."
Acquarium in Busan,Our grand daughters thoroughly enjoyed exploring the different exhibits. They especially loved feeding the fish. The Dinosour IMAX was excellent.
"Educational and enjoyable visit, great for kids",I really enjoyed my visit to the Busan Aquarium. I did like that they stressed the importance of rehabilitation. There was a lot to see and read about in the 1.5 hours we spent there. It was a little disappointing to see their sharks in such small tanks. One shark spent it's time just swimming in circles as it had nowhere else to go... but I suppose that's to be expected at an aquarium.
A regular Aquarium,"Cannot be compared with the big Aquariums of other cities (i.e. Singapore, Shanghai, Genoa, Nagoya, Atlanta), however, considering the size of the city, it is a really fair one. It's main attraction is the big tank with sharks in the lower lever, from which you can pass through, walking in glass tunnels. If you have been in a big aquarium of another city, maybe it will be just a repeat for you. If not, it will be a good experience!"
Average,"Nicely setup small aquarium displaying small collection of sea life. Best part was penguins feeding show. Shark feeding - which is another show - was a terrible experience, converted into some kind of karaoke type of performance with shouting, singing and a lot of noise. Really took away the mood of being there to experience a nature life. "
Waste of money,Much like Aquariums elsewhere you get to see fish of every size held captive for your enjoyment.This site is far less exhilarating than most.
fireworks festival,We saw the fireworks festival while visiting the aquarium. There were over a million people there and the festival lasted over an hour with music accompanying the fireworks. It was magical. It needs to be booked a head. The day before the festival the room was 60 thousand won. The day of the festival it was 200 thousand won.
Interesting for a 2 hour visit,A little on the pricey side and has some interesting features such as the large tank with an interesting mix of fish. They have a rescue program for finless porpoise. They had one when we visited. Can only be viewed from a distance and was interesting. No staff on standby by tanks to ask questions etc. interesting but not a must to visit. 
good for instagram pics,"-underwhelming variety of marine life, as well as the obvious lack of energy and livelihood among the animals at the aquarium-could use a renovation -seems like a popular/ cliche place for couples"
don't expect too much,"I went with a friend after 5pm and enjoyed enough cause we did not expect that much .. We just walked around the beach and just stepped by this place. If you go there before 3 or 4, you can have some events like feeding animals."
"Well kept, informative, and underwhelming","Located right off of Haeundae Beach, this place provided a welcome respite from the heat, as well as an entertaining hour or so for my girlfriend and I. Perhaps I came in with outsized expectations, or perhaps it really is just not as spectacular as other aquariums in Korea. The impression I left with was good, but nothing special."
A variety of sealife,"A really nice aquarium, lots of surprising things to see. A little bit pricey and some stuff is mostly for kids."
It is ok but should not be the main reason for a visit to Busan,Fascinating because it is underground but mainly for families with kids. Standard stuff with the usual shark tunnel. Sheap and good eateries in the food court at the exit. 
Decent Aquarium,"Situated on the beachfront. Our bullet train tickets to Seoul came with a discount to the aquarium so we decided to check it out. The aquarium itself was nothing spectacular, a bit small. The shows and guides were in Korean so we didn't understand much. But then again we didn't really need to."
Beautiful aquarium right on Haeundae Beach,"All manners of sea creatures are available for your viewing pleasure. The admission is a little expensive, but here's a tip for parents in the area: buy a discounted season pass and you have a nice place to get out of the sun all summer long."
"Decent aquarium, not very big or *impressive* for the price","We went planning on spending an entire afternoon here, but the whole place is pretty small overall. We got to the end and thought ""Uhhh is that it?"" after about an hour and a half. Definitely go if you have a discount - we had discount tickets for about 14,000 won, and I felt like I wouldn't want to pay full price (something like 28,000 won?) - the aquarium was nice, but nice with the discount. "
Wonderful Experience at Sea Life Busan Aquarium!,"Had such a wonderful experience here! It's an attraction suited to all ages and it is affordable. Highlights: 1) You can have your photograph taken when you enter the aquarium - which is quite a nice keepsake! 2) There is a lovely shop at the end of the aquarium 3) For a small extra fee, you can go on a 4D ride at the end of your visit to the aquarium. Set aside at least 2-3 hours for this attraction. It is situated right on the beach front, which is great as you can go for a walk on the beach and grab an ice-cream after your aquarium visit. "
not really worth it.,"It's ok. It's like most aquarium although many of the tanks have surprisingly low walls. It's very dark in there and really quite expensive. Not really worth it IMO. If it's a rainy day and you have absolutely nothing better to do....and you want to throw away 25,000krw have at it. Personally, I'd rather spend the time and money at a seafood bar nearby."
Rather impressed!,I was rather impressed. The aquarium may not be as sheer big in size as other aquariums in the world but they do have diversity including some creatures I didn't know exist (the ocean sunfish is amazingly big!)
Better than most aquariums I've been too,"The Busan Aquarium is very well designed and maintained, much better that most of the aquariums I've been too. It's near the beach so it is worth to visit it if you are in the area."
FUN,Busan aquarium it's great! We had visit quite a few aquariums in the world and the Busan it's definitely worth to visit. Specially for the kiddos. It also has an small play place inside that my kids loved it! Go for it!
Good,"It's a good aquarium, but no need to go there intentionally unless you're staying in Haeundae area. The aquraium has dolphins, penguins, sharks, turtles, jellyfish, crabs, etc, It is not a big aquarium but species are plentiful. Bathroom facilities were not very convenient though. We walked through everything before we could find one."
"Good Aquarium, love the shark exhibit.","I liked the layout of the aquarium, they have a really nice setting when you first enter the aquarium underground. What I really liked was you can walk over the shark exhibit and get cool pictures of your feet and sharks. My husband and I had a lot of fun with that. Overall a nice aquarium. Go if you are near haeundae beach."
Expensive,"We are from Chicago and have the renowned Shedd Aquarium....so it is hard to see others without prejudice. The aquarium is small and can be seen in an hour. While I was disappointed, my 16 year old loved it. She felt the small spaces made her feel like she was a part of the exhibits. There were about 5 other people there whenever we were, so we could take our time looking at everything without any lines. So while I thought it was 2stars, my daughter gives it 4 stars."
Great Aquarium but Pricey,"Took my twin 2 year old and 9 year old on a Monday. It wasn't too busy and everyone enjoyed it. Really loved the play structure in the middle to let the kids play. I wish that the boat tour was more frequent, we had planned on doing it but it was an hour wait before the next one. Cost is high."
A def. must see,"Piranhas, sharks, water tunnels. A feast for eyes. There is a fee for entrance. 1 hour is enough for medium speed visit. There are also organized events, and discounts."
Small,It is a small Aquarium with not many animals at all. We walked through the whole facility in less than 30 min.
Fun to watch Penguins,This is a must visit place for those who haven't to aquarium before. It was real fun to see Penguins. Sharks were also a major attraction. The only limitation was that all the shows were in Korean language only.
Nothing much to see for the fee you pay,All show was in korean language....aquarium is small not many interesting fishes or under water sea life animals
"If you're not a beach lover, Busan Aquarium is a nice alternative","Though I've been to many aquariums, I was pleasantly surprised to see sea life I had never encountered before. Another fascinating observation was that some of the fish were really enormous. So even though it was an average-sized aquarium, some exhibits managed to take my breath away."
Fun to watch sea creatures,"Not so different as ocean park in the philippines, exciting to watch the sharks and colorful fish, more for kids"
Typical Aquarium,"Not comparable to the American standards of aquariums, but typical of what's around South Korea. My family and I are intrigued and love sea life, so every opportunity we get we go visit aquariums when we go to new places. We were really excited to see pictures outside the aquarium of green sea turtles and was very disappointed to see that it was false advertisement, as there were none. They had tons of different fish, but the highlight for us was the sharks. We watched the feeding time, they have the live seating area and then a separate area that you can watch on the screen. Highly recommend if you stay to watch the feeding time, stay in the area where you can watch it on the screen because more than likely there's no seats in the live area and you can still take pictures with the sharks after the feeding. For those with the kids, they give you a little booklet where they can find all the different stations to get imprinted stamps. The kids will love it. "
A good variety of fish - large and small,They had a nice otter exhibit and frequent feeding sessions were interesting. Comparable to COEX in Seoul. 
Nice,"beautiful aquarium. Have a souvenior shop at the basement. Food court at the basement sell food at a reasonable price and it taste nice,"
Cheap and Foolish. Got Suckered,"Underground and sweaty, super crowded and hot. Great if you're 5 years old, horrible for foreigners and tourists. The reason for the bad rating was because we had a 20% off coupon only for foreigners. When we arrived and showed them the coupon on my girlfriend's cell phone, they said we needed to have it printed out to have the 20% discount... Which makes no sense. Why on the planet would I bring a printer with me or have access to print something out when traveling abroad. And we're in flippin South Korea, a hyper technologically advanced society... for what reason, other than being cheap, would a place like this require you to have a printed copy, if the coupon is only for foreigners? Maybe if I lived here...They draw you in and then treat you like dirt. Screw this place."
Great Aquarium!,"The Aquarium is great, has a decent size, various species and the price is OK.My advise is to go around 14:30-15:00 PM as there are plenty of events going on.You will see staff feeding penguins, and if timing is great, there's the famous SHARK FEEDING SHOW that I think happens at 16:00 in the main aquarium. You can also take a ride on a glass bottom boat (has to paid extra), but I don't think it's worth it.Divers feeding sharks, how not to enjoy?"
Not bad if you have sea loving kids,"A bit on the pricey side especially for a family of 4 with no discounts. Thought the 3D ride sounded interesting so we booked it together with our tickets as it was cheaper than buying it later after looking around the aquarium. COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME!! Please DO NOT buy the 3D ride. It was the lousiest ride I've ever taken! Even my 6 year old thought it was unexciting! Big yawn.The aquarium isn't too bad. We've been to much larger and more exciting aquariums in Japan, Australia and NZ. This does not quite compare to that standard but it was not so bad. Worth a visit if you've never been there or you have kids who simply love the sea and the creatures living in it. Otherwise you are not missing much if you've visited the Japan, Aussie or NZ ones. The displays are well kept and in good conditions and the sea creatures are varied and interesting. Not much info though. Some of the displays did not even have the names of the creatures in them. Only later then we found out that they wrote everything at the SIDE of the display and not at the display itself. We sometimes had to work out what creature was inside what tank. Hmmmmm....."
Average,"In order to visit the aquarium or really any attraction in Korea you need to be very patient with the locals as they queue jump, push past you with out any sign of curtiousy. If you can accept getting pushed out of the road without an excuse me or apology then you are half way there.The Aquarium itself follows similar layouts to others I visited in other worldwide locations but probably on a smaller scale. The fish appear healthy and there is plenty to see along with the many small displays. As Jeff mentioned if you have kids it is great for them and very enjoyable.Staff were friendly and curtious.Worth a visit, but some will be disappointed"
Average aquarium to visit,"As we enter the aquarium, we saw many species but it was all too soon but over. It was a really quick to see everything despite being Korea's largest aquarium. Don't think it's value for money."
"As always, great for kids but also a fun escape for adults",A few unique attractions like the viewing bubbles for kids and the shark tunnel make this a fun attraction to go to. Being in places like this with kids crawling everywhere and crazy things to look at will bring a smile to your face and be a worthwhile excursion. It also helps that it is strategically located on the beach and surrounded by great restaurants.
Not Original,"The aquarium actually is not Korean , it is part of Australian company namely Sea Life which got many aquariums in the world such as London one so if u already visit one of them u will notice design and even many fishes are similar to the other branches. Ticket with discount coupon which i took from my guest house was around 20$ and not worth it at all . "
Interesting,"The aquarium is well developed and very interesting. Slightly overcrowded and overpriced. Have been 2 times and recommend the low season, or winter as there is less crowd. "
Busan Aquarium,"Well worth the visit!! It was a wonderful experience, and the displays are gorgeous. The staff are very helpful. It was certainly an eye opener. Easy enough to get there, we bought a day pass with the metro, around 4500 kwr per person. The fee per person was around 24000 I think but it's worth every penny"
A Mixed Bag - wonderful exhibits but crowded and expensive,"Animals on display are world class - beluga whales and sun fish (Mola mola) are a couple recent additions. The massive walk through section has sharks and turtles galore. Audio guide is informative and added bonus - it blocks out the noise from the massive crowds this place draws. Don't go on weekends and also cross your fingers there isn't a school field trip! As always, expense is relative. By global aquarium standards, it is cheap, but by Korean tourist attractions standards, it is very expensive."
A bit smaller than expected,"Busan Aquarium is always advertised as being the largest one in South Korea, so I got a bit of expectation before going there. I am quite into ocean animals, so I tend to go to aquarium of any city which is by the seaside. Nevertheless, it's easy to get to, as just at the Haeundae mile-long beach. The aquarium is a bit small, maintenance is ok. There were quite a number of talks for kids, though all in Korean. From what i observed, the thing those kids most enjoyed was stamp collection in a booklet !! Worth a visit if you are going to Haeundae."
Good for all,Busan Aquarium has been maintained well. They have feeding time for fishes and maintain their schedule well. Photographers could enjoy their time.
Very nice place to enjoy with your family,"Located just beside the hyundai beach, it has so many different underwater species you have ever dreamt off. Penguin, scary sharks, amazing jelly fish and so pn. If you buy the ticket for 3D show you may get discount for the entry ticket. I visited there at night and I missed the penguin show and other shows. So, visit the place before that to enjoy it fully. They have souvenior shop that I also liked. Small boxes are there to be rent to keep your bags or other things. There is also food court to fill your tummy.."
Relatively small Aquarium,"I have visited beautiful aquariums before (in Osaka, and in Dubai) and this one in Busan is a relatively small -- just enough for the a small excursion for kids! And the entrance fee (24,000won) is way too expensive for its size and facilities. I honestly would not recommend this place if you have a short time to spare in Busan. You may skip it. "
Great place to be! ,Located near the beach next to Novotel Ambassador Hotel its a good place to bring the kids. Builded 3 level underground this aquarium also have it 3D cinema and souvenir shop at level 1. 
Very exiting and nice spot to see,"large aquarium with various water habitants in there to see, especially interesting for kids. located very conveniently on the beach walking area by the sea shore right along the sandy beach Haeundae area. there are a lot places to see around it and to eat. There are a lot of hotel nearby to sleep over. I stayed in Haeundae Grand Hotel. very good hotel with many services and facilities available for its guests to offer. "
"Not huge, but what was there was great","Visited here with my wife and two babies. Cost for us two was 48000 won (so about 27ish quid). We thought this was expensive and we only spent just over an hour in the aquarium. This all said, what was there was very good and you had a real sense that they were not just running an attraction but also doing some good for the environment, rescuing animals and rereleasing them etc. The main thing there is obviously the huge tank at the end that you walk around, over and through. It had giant sharks, huge fish, a massive sting ray etc. Was very impressive. So, if you are hard up for cash I would give this a miss, and although it is only an hour long experience it is an hour worth having!"
Sharks,"We have been to several nice aquariums across the US, the Busan Aquarium is the best experience we have had. First it is in a great location on the beach, also very kid friendly. We went at night time so the crowds were way down which was a plus, and the shark tank was fabulous."
Fun family activity,Rather large aquarium with many different types of sea life. The design of the aquarium is very creative and original. Very happy place. Really enjoyed my visit.
This place will not disappoint you!,"If you bring children or pre-teens I can easily say it's worth it! It's absolutely not the best acquarium out there, but it's above the average.The location attracts most people, I don't doubt. It's right besides the beach and that's the beauty of this whole place."
Underwhelming,"Our family was expecting a bit more of the ""wow factor"" for the price of admission. On arriving at Busan Aquarium the clerk at the ticket booth was very friendly and helpful, but we came to find out that quite a few displays were under construction and many of the excursions, like swimming with the sharks, required a lengthy prior reservation. The aquarium itself is smaller than expected, but it did offer some interesting species, a touch tank and other features you would usually find in a typical aquarium. Is it worth visiting? I would say yes, but keep your expectations low. "
Our Second Aquarium,"Sydney's Sea Life Aquarium now has a surprisingly rival here. Everything is exceptional and child friendly. Our kids are just having one of the time of their lives. Strategically located at Heundae Beach and almost about 40-45 minutes ride from our hotel At the Paragon, The long trip was well worth it given we had to wait at a long cue hehe. Food stalls are readily available inside or outside. and lots of cheap but quality souvenirs as well."
small but satisfactory,"I visited the aquarium with my daughter for about four hours. My impression is that it was a good place to visit with children, but nothing extraordinary. We especially enjoyed the shark tank, and the jelly fish; the area where you could handle starfish and others was also a nice 'touch'. The aquariums looked clean and the fish, well maintained, but still, we noticed a half-dead fish in one of the aquariums being bitten by its tankmates. My daughter was somewhat disappointed with the tiny space alotted for the two belugas, the main reason we went to the aquarium (they were on the advertising posters). The boat ride also was not satisfactory. Overall, it is something to do with kids if you have the time and the money to spend."
My First Aquarium - Lots of Fun,"I have never been to an aquarium before so I didn't have any preconceived ideas about what makes a good or bad aquarium. That being said, I was not disappointed by the Busan Aquarium. First, I was impressed that they inquired if we were military when we stepped up to the ticket booth and gave us the discounted military price (even though we are US and not ROK). The aquarium took us about 90 minutes to go through as we took our time and I stopped often to take lots of pictures. There are few large animals in the aquarium with a few 10 foot sharks being the largest creatures we saw. They do a good job showing off their smaller animals though and make it a great learning experience. The only thing we were really disappointed by was the lack of English translations for us non-Koreans. Overall though, it was a worthwhile stop."
Otterly Marvellous,"We visited this aquarium in Haeundae Beach, Busan during our visit in May 2014. The aquarium is all below ground. It was a bit smaller than I expected and they were doing some work while we were there - I think it has just been taken over by Sea Life.It was reasonably expensive to get in, although we did have a discount ticket. also, it doesn't open until 10am, which surprised me - we had to hang around outside for 10-15 minutes.There are explanation signs for all the exhibits and these were mainly in English as well as Korean. They had a big tank you could walk through and a big viewing area where you can watch divers go in to feed the sharks and Rays. There's a touching area where you can handle starfish and other small creatures, but our favourite section was the otters! the otters are fed at 10am and at 2.30pm. there were 4 of them, a family, in the enclosure. When we arrived they were asleep, all snuggled up together (so cute!) but woke up once the fishy treats arrived! they were so playful and entertaining I could have watched them half the day!There's a biggish shop on the way out and you can go on the simulator ride as an extra. It was a 'Ice Age' (as in the film) themed ride, all in Korean, but I didn't worry too much as these things just make be laugh for some reason! Once you've finished at the aquarium, you have the beach to stroll along and plenty of restaurants to grab a bite to eat."
Not worth,Very small place. Nothing so special on the aquarium itself. Entrance ticket is too expensive. I feel wasted money & time to spent there. 
Save your money... unless you really love fish.,"The reason that this gets even 3 stars is because seeing big saltwater fish is cool. The aquarium itself is not very nice. Parts of it were under construction, but I am not factoring that into the review. My only other aquarium visit was to the National Aquarium in Baltimore. These two seemed night and day. The Busan Aquarium had a dirty feel to it and there was little attention to detail. The 'glass bottom boat' above the main tank was pretty hokey. Most of the enclosures seemed far too small. This aquarium is not worth the price."
Not impressive,"I was disappointed in this aquarium. It cost us around US$75 to get in (4 members of my family, after a 20% discount) and we spent under an hour in the aquarium. Many of the enclosures were closed for renovation/rebranding. It has the typical animals, but no hands-on exhibits. We bought a simulator 'ride' which turned out NOT to have English subtitles (I should have known better) and was a sorry excuse for a ride. Overall I would not recommend this aquarium to anyone who has been to one elsewhere …. you won't find anything unique and you'll be out a bunch of money."
Worth Seeing,"I'm not that big on aquariums, but this one is good, especially with kids. I took my daughter there and she loves it. It's located on Haeundae Beach, so there are plenty of hotels and restaurants surrounding the aquarium. I didn't expect much, but I was surprised. There was a shark tank and they provided a show as well."
Nothing Special,"After many visits to Busan, finally I got chance to visit this Aquarium.After seen many aquariums in may countries including Dubai and Japan, there was nothing special for me. You may find its exciting to walk below the huge glass bottom of tanks where many different kind of fish are swimming~"
Short,Fishes. Like a typical aquarium. Quite a few attractions were closed down for renovation. Not bad they have english descriptions for the fishes. 
Daebak!,I love this place since i'm a diver and im happy that busan had one of place that caring about marine life. Love to see dolphin and the penguin and the leopard shark looks like they very friendly. Too bad when im visit it's about to close at 10.00pm i guess much more im not have a chance to see them all. One day i will visit again and try to dive there..Recommended for people love to see the marine life.
Small but varied,"The aquarium was under renovation the day I visited, and is apparently going to rebrand itself. I love aquariums, and this is a small one, but houses a varied selection of fish and aquatic animals. I especially loved the otter exhibit, which offered them lots of scope for play.The glass-bottom boat trip over the main tank is a must - spectacular view of the fish.I'm not that taken with the decor which is reminiscent of a theme park, but the staff are obviously professionals, and take good care of their charges. The many creatures exhibited in specialised aquariums offer fascinating glimpses of life under the water.Well worth the asking price, and a nice way to spend an hour or two."
Good job,"Good job. Some tour guides will be useful, to explain the creatures . I think it was ok for the price."
Nice aquarium,"Located in front of haeundae beach, its Nice aquarium, clean place, clean bathroom, they also have various event like feed the sharks, feed the penguins, singing together, magic show."
Busan Aquarium at a convenient place,The Busan Aquarium is conveniently located on the main street in the Haeundae Beach area just next to the Novotel Ambassador Hotel and the Shinsegae Duty-free shop.
Still alright...,Busan Aquarium is big....but the entrance fee rather expensive. Best for outing with friends and family. A big set back was some part of the aquarium in construction. Will visit again if the aquarium in full swing.
Korea's largest aquarium,"If you travel by KTX, make sure you produce your saver pass to get a 30% discount otherwise you have to pay 21000 won. This would be a good visit for families with children as the large smiley stingrays, sharks, playful dolphins, jellyfish, starfish would definitely draw their attention. Unfortunately, when you visit the aquarium at 5 pm or later, you will miss out on the feeding and other shows which are shown earlier so make sure you do some research on the showtimes before visiting.As in every tourist site, there will be always be a souvenir shop. Participate in a survey and you will get a 10% discount coupon which can be used at the souvenir shop."
Short but fun,As I remember the entry fee was relatively cheap. It was really really short. There was a waterless boat ride and some other unique items to do. 
Finless dolphin,was there and asking staff there what that animal call? my finger point to finless dolphin. answer is Korean dolphin. thats amazing answer to tell.hehe at the end i find out its call Finless Dolphin
Sharks LOTS OF SHARKS,"there is a observation tube that goes through the shark tank, there are other types fish in the shark tank, Very good aquarium for the price. Kids will love it adults will too."
Very nice aquarium!,"The Busan aquarium was very large and filled with interesting and creative exhibits. It took us about 4 hours, but we take our time... There are so many species, and I am sure you will not be bored."
kids will definitely love it,"For 24,000 won per adult, it was definitely well worth the visit. Lots of sea creatures, very informative."
