Cherry Blossom festival ,Early April untill 11st April 2019 National Cherry Blossom Festival (벗꽃축제 beojk-koch-chug-je) every year is different day please check before come. Next to the highest tower in Korea called ”Lotte world tower” also close by Lotte world (amusement park) I went to the lake on 8 April not too crowded they have some show also the stuff for sale along the lakeside.
A Must See Park With Magical Surroundings & Lake On Two Sides,"About:It has two lakes with Songpa-daero Boulevard running in between them, and a jogging course and walking trails along the lakes. The depth of the lakes is 4-5 meters approx. The park now serves as a great place for Seoul citizens to relax but it a good place for foreigners too. Tips:You can view many other attractions too in a day in Jamsil.First you can visit the lake, then Lotte World Amusement Park then At night Lotte World Mall.If you plan to go in winter wear not only warm clothes but gloves as its a lake and wind becomes really cold & chilly.The sun sets pretty early in winter so if you wana enjoy great views then go in day light."
Naru,Great park for a walk. Beautiful trees around the area. The lotte world tower is part of the landscape
Amazing Cherry Blossom,visited this place at the right time and saw the very long rows of Cherry Blossom extending across the whole Lake. this is behind Lotte World Amusement park walking distance from Jamsil Station
Peaceful ,This place seems like home to me...i visit at least once a week while enjoying a cup of coffee from one of the MANY coffee shops that are lined up along the lake...Seoul is a busy and fast paced city but it's nice to have a park to stop and chill out
one of the best places for Cherry Blossom viewing in Seoul,"Located behind Lotte World in Jamsil, Seoul, Seokchon Hosu Park is composed of two man-made lakes wherein the western part contains Lotte World's outdoor counterpart, Magic Island. The best time to visit is April-May, during the height cherry blossoms season. The big plus is that it's not as crowded as Yeouido Park during those times. Running track surfaces are laid along its banks where hundreds of cherry trees are located along side the path. Great for jogging or just a leisurely stroll. It's also conveniently located beside Lotte World Hotel, Lotte Department Store and Lotte World Tower."
