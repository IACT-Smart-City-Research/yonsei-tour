Impressive,"As the largest shopping mall in the world it's huge, sparkling clean and upmarket with designer outfits and accessories but moderate-priced in the restaurants on the 9th floor and the Food Hall in the basement.We had lunch at the traditional restaurant Gaejung, ordered the Jeonju style bibimbap and the seafood stew with soft tofu. Delicious, kind and warm service, value for money. There 's even a water dispenser near the lifts in this super-store.There' s a kind of Jurasic Park for children on the 9th floor before you come to the restaurants.Worth a few visits even if you're not a real shopper, you can get organic fruits and vegetables in the supermarket and try the lovely snack foods, skewers of meat, fishcakes, nut chips, buns and bakery goods which all look appetising and well-prepared. The cafes offer gourmet coffee and innovatjve dishes, Western as well as Korean. "
Truly a big store,It was suggested by the hotel staff to go check out this gigantic department store. It's very well kept. The 9th floor park is a great place. The view is awesome. Unfortunately I couldn't find any halal products or food here. 
Great experience!,"Super clean, modern and exclusive shops. everyone was so friendly and helpful. Plenty of parking easy to get access."
Touring South Korea. ,"Our tour guide took us to this Mall for lunch and then a walk through some of the the duty free shops. I’m almost sure we went up at least 5 sets of escalators and we could still see more ahead. Our lunch was at a buffet restaurant and the food did not disappoint. The few stores we visited were all priced like home. I liked the cleanliness and open atmosphere of the place, but merchandise wise, it is not worth struggling with extra luggage, when you can get the same items at home. Just checked off as having visited one of the largest shopping malls. "
Very large department store but it feels like a mall,"Supposedly the World's Largest Department Store...well it is big and has a lot of stores, movie theater, ice skating rink, etc. Why would you come here? To see a big place with a lot of people. Again, a lot of people so only come here if you really need to go shopping. Otherwise, the best part is the food court in the basement with a ton of different cuisines and desserts."
great food court in the basement,"We grabbed a bite for lunch at the counter of a noodle spot and tried to copy the locals. Great experience and great lunch. Had a quick tour around the mall- saw the Guiness Book of World Records certificate, went on the escalators, got a Starbucks Busan mug and checked out the skating rink. Neat spot for a quick lunch and visit- I wouldn't spend too much time here as a tourist."
Highly recommend!,So huge and nice with many choices to shop and even nice to walk around in there! Even has a nice vr experience that you should definitely try!~
Dissapointing,"Huge Department Store, very easy to reach by underground train, staff friendly and helpful, but unless you are a Designer fan and prepared to pay the exorbant prices at one of the many Designer stores, you are out of luck. The selection of non-designer clothes, shoes, etc. are very uninspiring, floor upon floor of the exact same clothes, very boring and dissapointing. The Food Court is ok, the Ice Rink nice to see, the Cinema absolutely modern, these are the best things about the place. Not worth a second visit. "
Guinness Book Of Records - Largest Shopping Mall,"This was a ridiculously large shopping mall. I know of no other mall that packs all the following into one building: a rooftop playground (known as Zooraji) filled with dinosaurs statues and playground structures, a golf driving range, an ice rink, a massive spa complex (Spaland) and tons of shopping.Besides the above, the downstairs basement floors contained the food market (consisting of another very large assortment of food and drinks) and a pharmacy.For all the people in the mall that day, the staff do a very good job maintaining the displays and the overall condition of the building. Prices in general were a bit on the pricey side so we just window shopped.The Guinness Book of World Records certificate was located next to the main information desk on the first floor.Overall a good place to keep anyone in the family occupied or entertained."
Dim Sum and Cheese Tarts,"This is review is specifically for the restaurant DimDimSum upstairs (not in the downstairs food court). There were a few restaurants upstairs (Korean, Chinese, Japanese and possibly Italian?) and it was much more relaxed and quiet up there than in the food court madhouse. We ordered dim sum with shrimp & scallop, shrimp, duck with choi sum and noodles, and stuffed eggplant. Everything was scrumptious and the staff were very kind and polite. Afterward we ventured downstairs and were ecstatic to find Kinotoya Cheese Tarts in the food court. They also had them in the Lotte Department Store in Myeongdong. Yay!"
A shopping center ,One of the biggest shopping centres I’ve seen. There is a lot of things to see. Many famous brands. Prices are cheaper then in North America. 
Nice high end,Nice high end department store. You can find everything you need. There is also food everywhere. And its near metro 
Shinsegae department Store,"It’s just a large building with mostly western high end brands, nothing you won’t see in any big city on the high end shopping streets, but disappointing that the lonely planet marks it up so high as if it is a must see, just wanna give you all a heads up. Spaland was alright if you wanna relax for a bit also don’t let the pics foul you as if it is a must, there are much nicer spa’s around "
Just a shopping mall,"I came here in search of something to do on a very rainy day in Busan. As someone who does not like shopping, I quickly realised this had been a bad idea. It is a very big and impressive shopping mall, but still just a shopping mall all the same. It is filled with western brands you can find all over the world.I checked out both the CGV cinema and the Lotte one at the top of the Lotte department store next door, but my timing was unfortunate there as both of them were showing almost nothing except Avengers: Endgame (the Lotte one, bizarrely, was also showing Notting Hill from 1999, presumably a 20th anniversary re-release).Anyway, in summary, if you like shopping, you'll be in heaven. If you don't, you'll quickly be bored and searching for something else to do."
Very huge shopping mall,No doubt it is huge with 2 departmental stores and many many small individual shops. Easy to spend time here and also plenty of food and resting spaces to rest your tired legs. Check out the plaque out front of the building that states this place is recognised as the biggest shopping mall in the world the year it was built.
Not a shopper but very impressive mall,"I do not like to shop, but even I must say this is a very impressive mall. It is absolutely enormous and we let our two teenage girls have an hour to run around. I don't think that was enough time - I bet you can spend an entire day here. The food court was really nice and we had lunch there. The claim to fame is it is supposed to be the largest."
Had to check it out,"Nice store ,impressive spaland,Nice ice rink for kids and family ,food stalls ok for choice by ice rink , but overall very expensive store with big designer name ;Gucci pradas and all big designer names you can think of. (Can't really shop here ,out if my reach ) . But had a quick look and I can say ;I've seen the world's biggest shopping store hehe lol "
Massive with duty free options,"If I were shopping for duty free items, this would be the place. One could also process tax refunds immediately and also arrange to be sent to airport for collection at the boarding gates. A simpler option of course to purchase from the airport. Duty free shopping is hassle free. "
This mall is conveniently connected to the subway station and spans multiple levels,"We visited this mall on a Monday afternoon. This mall is conveniently connected to the subway station and spans multiple levels. We tried many of the stall selling snacks, bread and gelato, among others."
Fun to walk around,"We wanted to visit simply because of it’s world record. It was fun to walk around, but we only spent 1.5 hours here. The more affordable shopping is in the basement floors and we liked looking at the food areas. We also enjoyed the arcade, which is on the same floor as the movie theater. It’s fun if you’re in the area, but from our perspective, skippable unless your purpose is shopping. You can also window shop at LOTTE Department Store next door. "
Biggest Department Store in Korea,"Shinsegae Department Store Centum City holds the distinction of being in the Guiness Book of World Recordsas the largest department store in the world in size and floor area. On e day is not enough to explore all the shops and dining places inside. For all your shopping needs, you will find everything in Shinsegae Centum City"
Massive Mall,"This place is massive and seems to go on forever. Just about every name brand store is here. Not as well organized as it could be, but with so many options that's to be expected. As some have noted, the prices are not cheap. If you are expecting major brands at lower prices as you would see in a mall in Bangkok you will not find that here. Prices are not bad, just not as low as in some other locales. Food options abound here, with basically three separate food court areas. The best are on the lower floor with the grocery store. A goid place to wander and shop."
Amazing store with large food court,"This is a huge store with an even larger food court. Every food imaginable, in different little areas. Korean food, Japanese bento, pizza, burgers, macaroons, Cinnabon cinnamon rolls, choco pies, French pastries....AMAZING!!! Also a grocery store is present. Everything under one roof. Short hours compared to USA....opens at 11 AM...closes at 8PM most days."
Shopping,shopping department store with really good prices but I prefer lottee department store even better during sale 
Just like any other big city mall,"Despite the glowing reviews for this place, I strongly would not recommend it unless you have a lot of time to spare or you have not experienced any malls before.While the facilities of this place is commendable and there are a lot of stuff to buy, Shinsegae is no different than other big city malls out there. The price range is also on the higher end, with items costing an average of 20,000 to 50,000 won.Coming from Singapore, Shinsegae just reminded me of all the big malls like Ion Orchard or Vivo City. Not a lot of difference, except maybe Shinsegae has bigger walking space and taller roofs. Don't deny that the place is huge but it's just different floors with the usual Men, Women, Children and Furniture departments etc. There's also a Kidzania, spa, cinema and golf range here if you're looking for something besides shopping. If you absolutely love shopping or have time to kill, then this place is for you. Otherwise, I would not recommend this place as it doesn't offer anything different other than a mall shopping experience in Korean. "
Massive shopping center,"Really neat to walk around and experience the massive shopping center, however the price tags are also massive in every store. I expected it to be pricey, but didn't expect all of the hundreds of stores to be so unreasonably priced."
Largest department store in the Guiness book records,"The department store carries most of the brand names as you can find in most department store. Interestingly, it is segmented into two buildings with a connecting bridge. As this is my first time there, one can get lost in the maze of shops. You need to see from the exterior to see the extent of space that it covered."
Big but nothing special,"If looks like any other major shopping centers that I have been to. Only manage to browse through the first storey as what I have seen did not attract me to go further. For shoperholics, I believe you will have the time of your life as this mall is HUGE. "
Huge shopping centre with big cinema,"Watched a movie with my family, the audio was in English with Korean Subtitles. The Starium cinema was beyond big. It was very comfortable and spacious inside the cinema. It is said to be the largest cinema screen in the world and I have to agree cause it was massive. There were so much things to do and shop there in Shinsegae that you can easily spend the entire day there. The spa land is great for seniors and adults. The kidzania is great for young children and the arcade and shopping is great for young adults and teenagers. The variety and quality of food is to be commended on as well. Many international cuisine dishes were served which made it very inclusive. Recommended to visit when you have an entire day of schedule free."
Big & Clean Mall Easily Reached By Subway,"This is reputed as one of the 5 biggest malls in the world but I think it ""was"" and not ""is"". Make no mistake that it's big but I personally seen bigger. This mall does have 4 floors of indoor golf driving range which is pretty unusual. Included are men and women's locker rooms where you could change into your golf outfit, practice your swing or take a lesson on the range, take a shower and change back into your street clothes, and no one knows that you had practice golf. The mall also has a big food hall in the B1 level where there's a variety of Korean, Japanese or American food to choose from. If you want a nice quiet environment to drink coffee, you could also go to the 9th floor where there isn't so many people. All in all, a beautiful, clean mall for shopping, eating and practice golfing..."
Great mall! ,"A great mall! So many food, so many shopping area. A must visit place in busan. To visit here : Alight at Centum City Station "
Great mall with a great food hall,It was a great mall with great shopping opportunities but most importantly with a fantastic food hall!! My husband is very picky with food and I LOVED the opportunity to eat what I wanted while he got what he wanted as well!
Wonderful mall,"Big, top class, clean.All exclusive brands in one place. Don’t miss the food court in -1 level.Also is a tax refund bureau."
Be prepared to get lost!,"I visited this store twice and could not find my way out into the rest of the mall. The store is massive! Every brand you can think of is here!If you are here to wander for hours, you have picked the right place."
Designer and Overpriced Food Galore,"Full disclosure, I went during dinner time the week of Chuseok so it was probably madness compared to most days, but expect a wait on the escalators or for any sort of food vendor. It's overwhelmingly big, but the majority of stores are just designer outlets with jacked up prices. I recommend the H&M though, nice selection for foreigners and spacious fitting rooms."
Just a shopping mall,"One of the biggest in the world, therefore it's quite easy to get lost there, lazy elevators, too many people, lots of too expensive luxury-stores (compared to europe)..."
A very big department store,"We visited at night on our way back from Haeundae beach. It is supposed to be the biggest department store in the world. Next door is the Lotte Dept store. If you like to shop for branded products, you can spend an entire day here, otherwise just spend a couple of hours to walk around. The area is huge. There is also a food court where we had a meal and drinks. Go to the rooftop at night and you get a good view of the surrounding area. Be aware that elevators are inadequate and slow. There is a metro station here."
"Huge, lots of shops but nothing special","If you like shopping you'll like it here, as the choice is huge, but it is nothing special.Visit the duty free shop to buy duty free items but carry your passport with you and evidence of a booked international flight."
boring use of time,"Shinsegae Centum City. The largest departmental store in the world. Spent a total of 15 minutes here and decided, nah, lets get to someplace else to explore."
"Good Cinema, nice department store, not enough elevators","Went to the cinema here and visited SpaLand. The cinema was good, very comfy chairs and good sound. SpaLand was also very nice.The department store is full of fancy brands. Nice to walk around here.It did bother me that the elevators are very slow and there aren't enough of them. The capacity is also limited, like only 10 people. It then says that it is full and it doesn't close...."
Worth a visit for a day's worth of activities,"This place is huge, with spaland and ice skating rink, and a huge foodcourt and restaurants abound. You can spend an entire rainy day here if you unfortunately has plans side tracked by weather."
Largest Department Store in the World,While this place is enormous I thought it was pretty average overall. Goods seem to be sold at a higher price than in similar stores nearby. Worth going to for a look but if you want a bargain shop elsewhere
Huge mall,Huge mall... With all varieties... Good discounts on branded products... You need atleast 2 hours to cover both sides... Decent food.... 15 minutes in taxi from huaendue beach.... Worth a visit.
Hints on this place,"1) Keep in mind there are two buildings. The big one is mainly dedicated by luxury brands and expensive shops. The second is more casual and democratic. Buildings are connected by the brige and in a basement (B2 floor).2) Obtain store guide near the entrance. The mall is too big for a human being ))3) B2 is one of the best floors. Book store, electro mart, good shops to buy a gift for friends.4) Food market (B1 floor) is good, but it almost always overcrowded. It's hard to find a place to eat and seat.5) Very good nursery room on 6F.6) Don't forget to have Tax Refund! Counter is on B2."
Its soo big,"Go 14 floor, lower ground is libray got ice skating there..got many iternational brands, a good place to look around and shoppings"
Mammoth mall that is not easy to navigate,"The basement food court was amazing as there were many food choices. However, we could not find a seat and finally had our lunch at the food court next to the skating rink at level 4. The departmental stores are all high end save for a few fashion street labels at basement levels. The layout is confusing and even with the help of it's brochure, we could not find the usual entrance of the fashion street area but entered through its car park. If you like luxury stores, then this is the place for you"
Huge mall but it's still a shopping mall ,"A very huge mall but I would not purposely come here if I don't visit the hauendae beach. The mall is too big and basically if u don't have intention to shop, there's nothing to see. "
just TOOOO big,"simply put, impressively big in every aspect, but just too big to be able to do it in one session. very high and top end merchandise, make sure your credit card has plenty on it....for cheap eats head down to lower basement for good health fast food."
"Shop newer side, avoid Cirillos (horrible)","This is the best mall in the southern Gyeongbuk area until the new Daegu Shinsegae opens. It has pretty much every major brand you will want to shop and almost everything you would want to eat. The layout of the old side is confusing as heck. The escalators make no sense and everything is scattered, around bends and in nooks and crannies. Takes some getting used to. There's a partial outdoor cross over walk way on the 4th and B2 floors to get between the new and old side. Why it was never enclosed is beyond me. The good food options:Brooklyn burger - thick home fries, sweet potato fries and cheese skirt burgers. Kon Thai - the steamed crab curry is fabulous and as is their red and green curries. Not overpriced either. Centum City's worst food options:Cirillos - lazy owner who uses the place to socialize with friends. At least talk in the back so diners don't have to hear you. Pulled beef and only chopped onions in a carne asada taco?!? Very little salsa on these tacos. Tartar sauce in fish tacos is an embarrassment. Also expensive. Service poor. Villa de spicy - trendy customized ddeokbokki place. Giant lines, overpriced and not really even good ddeokbokki. You could do better from the department store or street pojangmatchas. "
Just another mall,"A big mall, yes. But there's so many of those kinda ""huge"" malls in cities and Centum City is no different. Found the entire experience a little dizzying and the layout confusing."
Absolutely huge department store,"The department store is conveniently located at a subway stop. The department store is supposedly the largest shopping complex in the world - and I wouldn't doubt it. There is a golf range, children's dinosaur park (Zooragi - very fun for children), skating rink, and more in addition to the regular department store stuff! There is also a large basement floor food/grocery area, though it didn't seem overly large.I could also tell that the department store caters to really upscale consumers. I took a rest break in an area next to an auditorium, and noticed many, many seemingly rich housewives having lunch on the 9th floor. The shopping center also seems to be situated in an upscale area. There is notably a Trump World apartment complex next door. A Lotte shopping department store is next door as well.Definitely worth a visit."
a paradise for shopaholics!,"This place is huge and it was just too much for my husband and I to handle. We didn't come here to shop but to walk to Busan Cinema Center. But we did check out the food court and they had variety of foods. Still, it was too overwhelming for us. We will only return here for the spa world to relax. Other than that, it was okay. "
The Biggest Dept. Store in South East Asia,"Shinsegae wellknown as the biggest dept store in South East Asia. You can find most of things inside, foods, parfumes, jewelry, luxury bags, and even electronics. Definetely will go back on my next visit to Busan."
Not to be missed!,"Such an extraordinary department store experience. This should be on the list of the top 5 things to do in Busan. Certainly, it should be way above the Gamcheon Village experienceWhere else can you find a store with such an extraordinary spa, an ice skating rink, numerous movie theatres , floors filled with classy restaurants, golf, etc!The world's largest department store is a real class act. Absolutely nothing in the U .S. could ever co e even remotely close to this jewel!"
Very big shopping mall!,Too big of we just spend a little time here. Amazing view when we just move out from the subway station. The food in the food court also delicious and cheap
Great food options,This place has multiple levels of food courts with tons of options. There are a huge variety of shopping options also the few from the roof is amazing and it has a brewery.
Massive!!!! ,Great place to spend a good half day or so. Specially on a wet rainy day. Huge mall with a wide variety of shops and food court! Not necessarily the cheapest when it comes to clothing but you can find the odd deals. 
Big in size. No difference with other big shopping complexes in the world.,Just another big shopping complex selling very expensive goods. You just name it and you will find what you want especially the branded ones. A lot of people around makes it a bit noisy. Lots of restaurants. I would recommend go for the food rather than the goods. Lotte department store is just next to it so making it super big. It is supposed to be the biggest in the world but i don't see anything special about it. Not a must visit place in Busan for me.
Go for the food,"I have been shopping world wide and this is with no doubt one of the most expensive malls ever. It's big, pretty, many shops, but the merchandise is not different from others. I have checked prices for many imported merchandise such as cosmetics, shoes, bags And sown clothing. The prices are 1.5 more then Europe and 2 times more then USA. Why buy expensive ?!+ another thing that hit me (it also happens in other malls such as lotte) -the place is deserted. No shoppers, maybe 2-3 people walking around and all the other persons are sales.Some good things about it:Great bathroom for needThe food hall in the basement is greatAnd actually, the food hall is full of people (-:"
Overrated,"Yeah it's big and with a lot of shops. It might certainly be the biggest in the world, but for sure not the nicest. Everything is focused on shopping and less on the enjoyment. There are some places to eat and relax, but not very appealing. And the prices are way above average."
Biggest Mall Ever,"It was a really big mall, there was a lot of branded clothing store as well as cosmetics in the first and second floor. In the basement there's a lot of Korean brand clothing and cosmetics. There's a food mart too in the first floor also like a groceries mart. There was probably like 9 floor. I didn't get to explore or the floors. But I had lunch in the food cafeteria in the 9th floor, the price there was more affordable."
Centum city ,"I went to centum city not for buying stuff, but for the ice skating. Easiest way was through the metro (I was staying in haeundae). The ticket was for 1300 wons (centum city is 3 stations away from haeundae). When you come out of the centum city metro station, you don't have to walk to the mall, the station is in the basement (B2) of the shopping complex. The food market is on B1. The place is huge, I was unable to cover the whole thing (yes it was that big!).They have the usual brands: H&M, Guess etc. After walking around 3 floors I was tired and decided to quit browsing and went straight to the Ice Rink. It's on the 4th floor. It cost me 15000 wons (fee+skate rental). You have to bring your own socks and gloves. But if you don't have them, you can purchase them right there as well (I had to buy a pair of gloves. Price: 1500 wons). Since it was my first time skating, I had lots bad moments, but I had entirely too much fun. All in all it was worth it. "
Great for browsing,We wandered around and ate at the food court before visiting the spa. The shopping is definitely out of my price bracket but it was fun to look and the food court is amazing! The sheer size of the department store makes it somewhere worthy of a visit. 
Not what i expected,Everything is very expensive and none of the stores are attractive. The best floor is the food market with many different restaurants and bakeries.
This place was amazing,"I love how futuristic this department store is, and the park on the roof was very pretty, I loved every part of the beautiful building"
Shinsegae,HUGE place. Has more than 15 floors. I'm tracking is the biggest department store in the world. Amazing
Amazing Mall split in two buildings!,"This mall is huge. One thing that I learned the hard way is that one of the two building is only for clothing and the other one is for all the other things such as a bookstore, electronic store, a place for kids to have fun and all. I will return to explore the mall in more detail especially on the side which isn't the clothing side.Both buildings have a great selection of restaurants at the upper levels. There is an ice rink and probably many other things to see.Comparing to Mall of America, this place is really focus on the shopping. Mall of America had more distraction from the shops. The location of the Shinsegae is great and nearby many other shopping center and food places. You can taxi out of the place really quickly and head back with the cheap taxi fare to wherever it pleases you."
Nice to see not to buy,Is a big shopping mall with a lot of brandeed stuff ... go there with children have not much chance to shop...so bring your child up to the zootopia where a small park the kid can round around.
Nice ,"I barely explored the place but what I saw of it seemed like a typical shopping mall. I went to the food hall, there is a halal stall there that serves Indian food.  If you want to do some luxury shopping, then this is the place and if you are Muslim, then even better as there is a halal place to eat. "
Shop Amok. ,At Shinsegae they have everything. You just need to find it. This is the place to go if you need expensive watches or a t-shirt from H&M. They have it all. But don't bring a baby trolly. Because like all over Korea. The elevators are always full and slow and poor programmed. 
One of the best departmental store i have ever seen,This is one of the best departmental store I have ever seen. Full of varieties and comfort. Anyone should visit it when he/she is in Busan. 
Perfect,"It is absolutely a shopping mall like any other one, but pretty bigger. You can spend your whole day here because it has plenty of things such as foods, clothes, accessories and activities like ice skating and movie theater. This place is just for showing how available the life in this city is."
A disappointment!,"Reputed in the Guiness Books of Record to be the largest shopping mall in the world. Other than this, its just another mall. Good for shoppung, especially for luxury items."
Great place to shop,Had a great time shopping here and going to the cinema thats inside can spend many hours wondering around exploring all the floors they have all the top end brands plus a lot of western brands a duty free shop at the bottom clean with direct subway access a lot of people also combine a trip with the shinsegae Spaland which is on the side of the department store so on some of the reviews for spaland there seems to be comments on the department store and not the actual spa so worth a look on the spaland review as well . A goodall round experince with plenty to see and do .
HUGE,"This place is huge and has so many things. There are plenty of places to eat. So, you don't even need to plan ahead in terms of food. Our kids went to ice skating rink and Kidzania. Ice skating rink - It was ok. They provide a helmet for you to use but you have to either bring or buy a glove(1500 won) to skate. Depends on a safety personal, they try to monitor how you skate. It can be somehow annoying at times. Kidznia - Our girls throughly enjoyed the experience and worth the money. We stayed here for about 6 hrs and still didn't even get to look around much. It is that big."
What a place,Have travelled around the world one of best shopping areas seen. Beautiful place with extraordinary wonderful food. Worth a visit.
Nice ,This was a very big department store in Busan. It was fun walking around and exploring. We also tried out the spa land that was in the department store. That was a nice experience.
Good way to spend indoors,If the weather isn't cooperating this is the place to go. It has its own subway stop so it is very easy to get to. Luxury brands and pricey merchandise but it is even fun just to look around without buying. There is an indoor ice skating rink as well as a children play section. There are several food courts so maybe shop around. The top floor is a brewery and restaurant. There is also a wine room and champagne bar on the bottom food court.
Plenty of shopping ,"Two huge malls side by side with everything you could want to find. The best parts of the mall are the large theater, Ice rink and spa land. Worth a visit "
"Super big mall, many luxury brand are here","Super big mall, I feel it's spacey then Lotte mall. We went for watching Captain America Civil War at CGV here. If you fly with Busan Air you'll get discount price for the ticket we pay 8000 KRW for the ticket. "
Respite from the heat,"This is a good place to spend 1 or 2 hours of your time to hide from the heat of the sun. It's not as big as I thought it would be. I'm a little disappointed 'coz a section of it was closed while we were there. It's definitely the place to be for shoppers who love luxury items. The APEC Naru Park is just across it and the Busan Cinema Center is right on the next block.Tip: Go out to the terrace from the food hall section where you can get a good view of the APEC Naru Park, Suyeong Bridge and the Suyeonggang River, plus the beautiful skyline."
Nice shopping experience,I highly recommend this shopping mall for travellers who target for high quality & fashionable products & souveneirs. The spacious & neat interior design makes travellers comfortable during their shopping. Ginseng products are also available in this department store.
The largest and possibly nicest department store i have been to,"It's a beast of a department store! Not only is it beyond gigantic, it also has an ice rink in it, a movie theatre, a floor dedicated entirely to various grab-and-go foods, a floor with just restaurants, and lots and lots of ways to spend your cash.The store is beautiful, nicely designed, and a fun trip."
WOW - totally impressed,this shopping center is simply put - gorgeous they have the worlds largest department store and it is laid out not in the traditional sense that you see in the western countries. but all the top end stores are located in this location and i can highly recommend it for those that like high-end fashion. this place is located in a very nice area of busan
The largest department store in the world,"I stayed there for about 2 hours a few days ago. While my tour group members tended to enjoy shopping inside so much, I chose to look for a few items bot in vain and then turned to take some good photos inside and outside this huge emporium. The place is very very spacious, well organised and lit, comfortably air-conditioned and very pleasant even for mere window-shoppers of all ages. You may like to have some snacks and drinks inside instead of buying any commodities for taking away. The commodities are not particularly attractive in pricing unless you refer to out-of-range and off-season shoes. The washrooms are very hygienic too. If you have not enough time to see around inside in one go, try to reckon the number of levels, the number of entrance gates and the number of buildings of which this emporium is composed and you will then be able to imagine how many hours or days you may need for seeing around. i am sure as first-time visitors you will be impressed and do not find your stay a waste of time whether or not you get anything to purchase eventually. I do remember seeing a shop called Gift Wrap selling mainly gift packaging items like boxes, paper wrappers, gift cards and ribbons. While I do not believe this is a very good business to run in this building, the shop attendant did look professional, well groomed and attentive all the time in dealing with customer inquiries and introducing the products available. This is not an emporium for souvenirs, but in general world-class garment, coffee and fashion brands are represented and there is a wet market which is even larger than its supermarket. There are also a limited number of sofas on the first level for shoppers to take a break next to the main inquiry counter and the Guinness World Record plaque."
Excellent shopping! The renovations have been well planned.,Came here 2.5 years ago and again this month. They have renovated quite a bit and I must say the renovations were well appointed. Lots of stores. Beautiful space. 
"This is the biggest department store in the world, so it is something you can brag about.","Had this not been on a subway stop, we would have never taken the time to go here. As it was, we went there to eat in the food court and sort of window shop with no intention of buying anything. The place is huge, floor upon floor, and pretty glitzy, kind of like the big Macy's in NYC. I thought the food court was outstanding for its variety and size. I ate at a Johnny Rockets while my wife ate Korean. And, considering the high-end merchandise that I saw in the shopping areas, it was pretty reasonable to eat in the food court. I'm not really sure if there was a mid-range shopping area in the store. We saw only the big name brands but did not explore the whole complex which includes a theme park, ice rink, driving range, spas, etc., etc. So, I would recommend that the Busan traveler get on the subway, get off at Centum City and explore this place. And, check out the Lotte Trevi Plaza next to it."
Great place for shopping!,We had a great time here. Set in a great location with plenty of selection to choose from. We found exactly what we were looking for and after shopping we went to Spa Land to relax. Love it! 
You can't miss this if you love to shop!,"It's no surprise that the largest mall in the world would be located in South Korea! South Koreans love to shop and have great taste in fashion! Not only you'll find international and local fashion brands but you'll also be able to shop for tons of cosmetics, personal products, home decor, food... however, most of the things were ridiculously overpriced but it is still worth visiting, especially if you run out of things to do in Busan or it happens to be a rainy day."
The most amazing mall! ,"Shop til you drop here or until you run out of money hahaha, as clothing in Korea is very expensive. But the sheer size of this mall alone is amazing. They have brands foreigners would be familiar with and Korean brands too. Beauty, home goods, art, and delicious food. The food court is great here, we had Korean soup bowls and udon.I bought a beautiful dress here actually in the walkways outside the stores. The clothing and items for sale outside the stores are usually there because they are on sale.You can honestly spend hours here, which we did!Tip of the day: if you want to be like a local dress up when going to the mall. Mall going in Korea is different than America that way. Koreans dress up to the nines, and Americans go in flip flops and sweats. Cultural differences."
Shoppers' heaven.,"If you've got the money and time to spend and love shopping, this place is for you. Luxury brands, perfumes, cosmetics, clothing, shoes, accessories - everything is here including an indoor skating rink and a good food court.Not exactly my cup of tea, though, as I don't enjoy this much or this type of shopping when I travel. I also don't like huge crowds when I shop and this place gets extremely busy on the weekend.A bonus is Spaland's proximity."
Big Mall,"Coming from growing up in a small city compared to the rest of the world. This was a very interesting place to go due to it's size and large amount of shops. But after exploring South Korea previously, I came to realize this Department Store is merely a super sized, and overpriced mall.These stores are all over Korea now so making a trip for this Store is not worth the time and money; but if you have never visited one, it's worth the experience."
The biggest department store in the world,It is which the proud plate aays just in front of the big building which remember more a shopping center than a department store. Diferente fro the new york or london department stores this is very modern and spaceful.
This place is huge,"This store is huge.I like it because it stocks a large variety of western food brands and beverages compared to other large malls in Busan. Also, it has Spa land which is awesome. It has a great food court and provides free pram hire. On the 9th floor they have another food outlet area, but the 9th floor has a play area for toddlers surrounded by tables. So, you can eat and watch the kids play. On the 9th floor you can also eat whilst looking onto the ice skating rink. Just a tip, if you are using a pram, the lifts can be really crowded so it's hard to get a spot, especially on the weekends. However, next to the lifts you'll see a door, and if you go through the door, you'll see another lift. This lift isn't used as much because people don't know it's there. It will save your sanity and time.The department store has alot of brands and is aimed towards mid to high end products.Make sure you visit the information desk because they give foreigners a voucher pack that offers discounts at certain stores. It has ample parking. "
Big shopping mall with ice skating facilities ,We visited the mall because of the ice skating track. The mall is big with a lot of different brands. More or less all expensive clothing you can buy here. Food court is however average. 
Largest department store in the world!,"This is huge. I just have problem finding the exit!! No joke. But we were not there for shopping, as such we did not really lots of time there. "
Big shopping center,"This place is a typical shopping center, but on steroids. It's huge. I wouldn't say there is anything about Shinsegae that is much different than any other shopping center besides the sheer size of the place. There is a three story driving range on top for anyone interested in golf. I don't know if you can rent clubs there or not. A nice outdoor playground is located on the 9th or 10th floor. My favorite park of Shinsegae is the American Chinese restaurant on the bottom level. It's really called that too. I didn't try it, but I think it's hilarious that there is an American Chinese restaurant. There are many better things to do in Busan than visit Shinsegae, but if it's cold and/or rainy, why not come here and say you've been to the world's largest department store?"
5 Star Department Store,"Shinsegae Department Store is much more than a department store. It has absolutely everything you would ever need or want to do. You could easily spend an entire day there. There's top name brand shopping, there's spectacular food from a food court to proper restaurants. There's even an ice skating rink! One warning though, bring your credit card, or a big wad of cash."
Big Shopping Mall,"Supposed to be the largest departmental store in the world. It is indeed big inside. More like an upscale shopping mall. As we are not hardcore shoppers, we left after some window shopping and a cup of coffee. This place can be reached by taking the metro to Centum City station. It’s linked to the metro station. There is an APEC Naru park nearby if you prefer having a walk to shopping."
The world's largest department store,"This specific Shinsegae is the world's largest department store, though I'll admit, that doesn't make it stellar by itself. The stores have a decent number of wares, and the bookstore area is especially nice (though I wish Korea would stop putting all their books in plastic wrap). They even have a skating rink and a movie theater on one of the higher floors. Overall, though, I was here to see it rather than to shop, and I was satisfied. I've seen more entertaining department stores, but this one is worth a go if you're in the area, even though I wouldn't go out of my way to go again. Also, it's connected to SpaLand, which is definitely worth checking out!"
A huge dept store,"The dept store is huge, the world's largest. Go to the rooftop to relax while enjoying the city view of Busan. "
HUGE,This is the largest shopping mall in the world-although it doesn't feel like it inside. Not sure if perhaps we just didn't see the whole thing but they have just about all the stores you could want to a few days worth of shopping let along one full day. Good food options too upstairs on the top floors. Plan for a full day here.
Quite a let down,"This was supposed to be one of the highlights of our 14-day Korea trip. After all it was the world’s largest department store. But I must say I was pretty disappointed, it didn't seem the size of what I'd expect the biggest shopping centre in the world to be. I am not sure how they measured the size, but the actual space devoted to the shopping area's is really not all that big, I was expecting many different shops and brands to choose from but we just saw 9 floors of the Shinsegae stuff.I explored the mall in about 1 hour after deciding there wasn't much that interested me. I ended up not buying anything at all. So I guess just go there to be able to tell your friends that you have been to the world’s largest department store, but other than that if you don't want to risk being disappointed, don't place your expectations up too high."
Good place for shopping mall lovers!,"It's pretty huge and right next to it there's the Lotte department store which is as well huge and filled with plenty of shops. Not very cheap as a lot of these shops are high class brands. A lot of food, and a small mall food market is available in shinsegae."
Come for the gorgeous food!,"We came here for the food porn and to get something to eat. Wow, what a place! Whatever your heart's desire in shopping (actual or window shopping) you can find it here. You can spend an entire day here if you want. When you get hungry go to the food hall and get something to eat-Korean, Japanese, Thai, Indian, burgers, you name it.Impressive. Wish I could have eaten four dinners!"
The largest department in Korea and in the world,"The largest department in Korea and in the world is a very pleasant place for shopping , the quality of service is great . Much higher service standard that in Europe and the US and most of Asian department stores . The cinema complex is very unique and has amazing projection quality as well as sound, all foreign films are shown in their original version with korean subtitles . Well worth a visit for the day ."
Shinsegae Dept. Store Centum City,"You can get lost in here for a whole day. The Store offers everything and all. If you want to do some shopping, you can go here. Its practical and it is central to Busan Business District."
Amazing food court and a massive dept store to explore,"This place is just awesome. It has everything, and even if you don't plan to shop it's fun to just walk around. The food court in the basement is a must - eat as much as you can stomach. But additionally, there's an ice skating rink, movie theater, spas, and even a driving range! The driving range is inside on the top three floors and really cool - though you do need your own clubs which is tough for a touristAnyway, this is a great place to spend a few hours in Busan - especially if it's pouring rain like when I was here!"
"It's shopping, just bigger","Big mall--lots of western brands available. Prices aren't cheap, but that is fairly standard for big shopping malls.The food court in the basement has lots of options, some reasonably prices, and some more expensive.Aside from that, kinda neat to see a skating rink in a mall."
Visit the Food Court,The food court of this Mall is something unique. Everything works like a Swiss watch. There is no way to go there and don't get stuffed with something. Prices are quite decent and most of the things are made in front of you!
Largest department store in the world,"If shopping is your thing, Shinsegae is a must visit! This beast of a department store has at least 9-10 floors with just about anything you could possibly want. Inside, you will find Spaland, an ice rink, a CGV movie theater, a large book store, as well as countless stores / just about any name brand merchandise you could want."
Big and expensive,"Depending on what your shopping needs are, this place can be a hit or a miss. Lots of designer brands but the prices are all original price. Not many deals, the food court is pretty amazing tho, cause there's lots to try from savoury to sweet. There's also a VAT station and has traditional Korean Spa inside to cater for those that want to relax while they wait for their shopping partners to take over the mall! "
Big? This place defines big!,"If you're visiting Busan and it's a rainy day, go to Shinsegae. If for no other reason than to say that you went to the largest department store in the world. But there are many other reasons to go to Shinsegae. For example, go to the food court. Not your typical mall food court. Why? Because there's an enormous ice skating rink. As I stood there and watched the skaters it reminded me of my visits to Rockefeller Center at Christmastime (but without the ginormous Christmas Tree)."
Just a big shopping mall,"It may or may not be the world's biggest, i cannot say, but it's definitely huge. If you like shopping malls you may find it worth a visit. I don't. The ice skating field it's fun, though."
nothing special,"Nothing special, a think there are mall definitely bigger than this one and with more interesting shops. The prices are quite high as well "
Head straight to the Food Hall! You can skip the rest.,"I’m not sure about the other cities, but in both Seoul and Busan, Shinsegae comes in the form of a multi-level shopping complex selling everything from clothes to homeware to… my focus – food. Lots and lots of food!There are some surprsing things you'd find useful to know before you go as they will help you get the most of the food hall experience and tips which will allow you to go farther on less, and you can find these at http://bit.ly/1Fql61Z"
There's a better mall not far away,"This mall is okay on rainy days.Not great choice on hip and young fashion or special stores. Food court is okay but pretty small.There is a much better mall not far away and much bigger, partly outlet prices. It's not on trip advisor, yet. We found it on our way to yonggunsa temple.From Haeundae beach metro station, take the bus 181 at exit 7. Exit the bus one station before yonggunsa station (alternatively, go to the temple and walk/drive to the mall on your way back).The mall is on the left side of the street, it's a huge complex with brand names on the building, pretty new-you will see it from the bus.Great choice of stores and a great food court with hand made noodles etc."
Waste of time,"It's just another shopping centre but even more overpriced and pretentious than normal. It's advertised as the world's largest department store but it isn't really all that large compared to shopping centres I have been to in Australia, Singapore, Manila, etc."
its a shoping mall,"You go there you shop. Its bigger the other shopping malles. So there are more shops. This in itself is not an experiance, if youre not a shoping mall tourist."
Quite the Shopping Experience,"This is billed as the largest department store in the world. It is definitely huge and well worth the experience, even if you are not a shopper.The format of this Shinsegae branch is consistent with other department stores in Korea, albeit on a larger scale. The first floor consists of cosmetics and luxury brands, second floor has more luxury boutiques, third and fourth housing women’s fashion, etc. Shinsegae Centum City is especially large due to the square footage per floor, with sports and outdoors shops (3F), an indoor ice rink (4F), a Kyobo Bookstore (5F), a Starbucks (6F), a movie theater (7F) a golf range and other special attractions taking up the extra space.Like other Shinsegae branches, Shinsegae Centum City does its best to bring you a global retail experience, with American, European, Japanese and Korean brands all under one roof. The selection is mind-boggling! Imagine having a simple shopping goal, like buying a women’s black overcoat. In your search for your black overcoat you will encounter seemingly endless permutations: down, synthetic down, cashmere, cashmere/down, belt, no belt, single and double breasted, hooded, no hood… (this is just a hypothetical example but you get the idea). Brands are segregated into sections within floors, so it’s not easy to zero in on what you want. When you get hungry, head to the 9th floor for the standard array of high-quality sit-down restaurants, or to the basement with a ton of Korean and international options. There is also a very good pharmacy on the B1 level.From level B2 you can access the Busan Metro and believe it or not, more shopping options. At various points in the year you can get a relative bargain on both the 8th and B1 floors, where there are “Event” or sale spaces. What an experience!"
nice place to spend time with family,"nice place to spend time with family, big, many choices to eat, and have fun together. large store with various brands to choose from."
Great mall for all budgets,"Pros:Very spacious Has both high end and mid level budgetsAll similar brand types eg sport clothes, are in same area Ice rinkRight next to trains Great food court Very clean. See cleaners cleaning all the time Cons:Can get busy on weekends but weekday also dead quiet "
Unbelievable!,"Even if you are not a shopper...this is a must stop in Busan. This department store looks like a mall. You could absolutely spend all day in Shinsegae....grocery store...bakery...restaurants...movie theatre, ice skating rink...it is unbelievable. And the little ones can ride a train outside the store.I love Busan, I have made 8 trips over in the last five years...this is just one of the amazing sights!"
Largest Department Store in The World,"At least Shinsegae Centum City has been selected as the largest by the Guinness Book of Records. Either way it's huge, with 14 floors of, well everything mostly western. You can go skating at the indoor Ice Ring or watch a film, anything really. It's good to see at least once :)"
Nice food court but not surprising shopping,I love the food court with variety of choices and spacious dining area. I'm not into shopping but if to compare it with Lotte Gwangbok I'd choose Lotte over Shinsegae
Very Nice & Big Shopping Mall,"Very Big mall, and a lot European brands. It's clean & very well organized. Clothes , Electronics, Toys, everything is there. Prices are expensive. Don't expect to find bigger sizes in Clothes.English language is problem, nobody speaks it.But Overall it's nice place to visit."
"Nice, but expensive.","The whole place is amazing and you can buy from toys to electronics. However, prices are not competitive, specially if compared to US. You can buy the same items on other stores in Busan, much cheaper."
Shopping with 70% satisfaction,"Big mall, huge variety of luxury European brands. Everything looks new, clean, well organized. Prices are usual. But!!! Nobody speaks English (it's a big trouble in tourists -non-friendly Pusan), even in information desk. Problem with big size cloth (bigger than XL) is actual to. Don't forget to make a tax-free refund form)))"
perfect shopping,"There are much brands to choose. It is a good location of the store. I'd liked to be there. I had find much world wide famous brands: LV, Prada, Tory Burch, Miu Miu, Etro and so on"
Lot to see,"but prices, like in whole Korea, not that good even on SALE. Selection is huge, especially for sport & hiking but it'll take time to find bargains. Food courts & restaurants in lower and upper floors are excellent, you can have free tasting in supermarket for some specialities in almost every bigger store."
Take a picture of the subway stop,"If you happen to be in Busan and going past Centum City, the subway stop is ridiculous. Classical music, faux Roman statues, fountains, etc. I have eaten in the basement a couple of times - they have everything from conveyor belt sushi to a hamburger shop called ""Johnny Rockets."" The prices are reflective of the ostentatious subway stop, however, and probably not practical for most travelers."
Huuugee,"Mall easy to access you can use metro and stop at bexco. Nothing special just a very huge mall.. very organized, they have internet centre, map, sofa in front of escalators, very comfortable for visitor who want to go for shopping or for just sightseeing. Expensive price but they also have non branded item which is cheaper. They have nice rooptop garden and they have nice cinema with huge studio.Its not a must visited place when you in busan but you can spare few minutes just for entering the biggest mall in the world."
Go to the food court,"This is a big mall, but it's also a great place to have dinner and see a movie. There is also a nice garden area on the roof. It's convenient for Haedundae and Gwangalli."
Pretty Average,"The Shinsegae Department store is very large and has many places to shop but it is not really anything unique. There are several floors of shopping which include a variety of clothing, food and a decent sized bookstore. I felt some of the items in the store were overpriced however it seems clothing in general in Korea is more expensive.Access to the department store is very easy, you can walk in from the street or take the subway. There is a nice entrance from the subway to the bottom floor where all the food is located. Again, even though the department store is large and nice I did not find much that would distinguish it from other large department stores in Korea. Many of its features for instance reminded me of Lotte Department store near Lotte World in Seoul. Even the way you enter off the subway is very similar to how you can get to Lotte World off the subway.There is a nice jjimjilbang called Spa land that is connected to the department store. Other than that though and the food court I really cannot see any reason to recommend this place over any other department store. If you enjoy shopping and going to different stores you will enjoy Shinsegae department store, but not any more than any other department store."
big mall,"the mall close at 8 PM, too early. i dont have much times to explore the mall since it is big, many branded items you can find here"
A nice place to browse around,Easy access from the subway Centum City station on Line 2 or Green Line. Adjacent to BEXCO. There is a Lotte Store next to it. Love the food court which has so much varieties and so clean. Nice to browse around and jostle with the crowds.
Shopping,Great shopping center. Plenty of info signs help you find requested stores. And it's one of the cleanest malls I've ever visited.
"Love the Store, Not the Prices","This store must be visited while in Busan. It is lovely with its architecture, displays, selection of goods and cleanliness. I loved getting caught up in the commotion of the downstairs eateries. There's all sorts of choices of food downstairs and in a few other locations of this store. I preferred the downstairs area as I found it more exciting. The only thing I didn't like was the prices of the goods, in particular clothing, shoes and cosmetics. The same brands back home in Canada and the USA are priced less for the most part. Example: I bought a pair of shoes in April at the Naturlizer store at my local mall. They were $35. The same shoes during the summer in Busan were approx. $120 US.If you live in North America and want to go shopping, check this store out but you might want to try and find items unique to South Korea."
This is the biggest department store in the world.,"The store is really huge.You cna find anything here.And it is well planned.So you can use a whole day here.If you are hungry,go to the market at B1.The metro is directly down there."
The largest Dept Store in the world!,"Great food court down in the basement, so much on offer not cheap cheap but certainly not expensive and very delicious.Great cinema complex up on the 7th flrThere is Spaland and a ice skating rink and then floors and floors of clothing, homewares, designware, cosmetics etc etc. Very well laid out and a delight to browse through"
World's largest department store according to Guinness,"Shinsegae Centum City is conveniently located across BEXCO and our hotel so you can get a quick shopping trip or meal in between seminars. Now, I don't know when the distinction between shopping mall and department store ends since as a mall, I've seen bigger in other parts of Asia and the US. As a department store, well, it's pretty big. Still, I wasn't there for shopping but one can see the merchandise are of high-quality - from big name global brands to fashionable Korean ones.If your time or budget doesn't allow you to shop, there are plenty of diversions in the 9 (or is it 11?) storey department store - from the famous SpaLand, a golf driving range at the rooftop, movie houses, a CineCafe branch, a skating rink, and a dinosaur-themed playground/kiddie park. There are 3 food options - the basement contains the Food Hall where quick meals and baked goods can be had at the counters; a Food Park at the 4th level near the skating rink for Korean, Japanese, Chinese dishes and several fastfood options. The 9th floor houses full-service restaurants serving different cuisines. Shinsegae is connected to and easily accessible by subway through the Centum City station. It's also adjacent to the Lotte Department Store which houses several brands not found in Shinsegae Centum City."
Huge Shopping Mall,"Shinsegae Dept Store is one of the largest mall I had seen so far in my life, there are 14 stories and it has many food outlets. My favourite level will be at B1 because there are so many bakery and cakes shops! Some even have free tasting corner. More on http://loveanqila.blogspot.sg/2013/07/travelogue-shinsegae-centum-city.html"
Boring and over-rated...,"I've been there a couple of times and couldn't wait to get out each time. Looks just like any other department store in Korea, over priced even with a sale and over crowded as usual. Nothing special about the architecture inside. Same typical setup as the other department stores. The outside has unique architecture, which made me a little surprised, due to the skating rink and golf range. Even with those additional features they just look like any other skating rink and golf/driving range that was just added onto the department store."
Same as most shopping malls but for the size,"Most things in here was overpriced for my (limited) budget. So it was merely a walkabout for us. Its a very clean, large facility that has ridiculously overpriced branded clothing and jewelry so that part didn't interest me much.The food court was what I enjoyed most. Such a wide range of cuisines for food court prices at above average quality. I recommend the pancake crepes."
IamNZ baby milk,"i have bought some imported baby milk in this store. The brand is IamNZ, which is made in New Zealand and imported to Korean. When i came back to my country, i can't find this brand in Google, and i asked my friend in New Zealand, they told me they even don't know this brand....Is it a fake product? i can't believe it!!!"
Great to explore and go shopping,"This store handles top brands such as Louis Vuitton and Tiffany and Co. And down to upscale trendy brands like springfield, I was pretty impressed. Good area for food choices, although I did find some areas a little bit scattered such as the make up section and couldn't figure out how the giant scaled imported brands such as MAC and NARS were separate from those that were locally made. Is it a hole in one for shopping? Id be 50-5 on that ;) they do have a fun ice skating rink, although it isn't that huge. Great to head here with family!"
The World's Biggest?,"We literally check out every section of “the world's largest department store.” It takes us about two hours, escalator after escalator, yet we can’t find anything interesting as the store sells mostly high-end items easily found elsewhere. The only section worth returning is Shinsegae Centum City Spaland (see separate review)."
for all the shoppers,"great place for the shoppers out there. I am not really a shopping person, but I did get a pair of running shoes there, which I am very happy with :)"
Not at all what I expected,"World’s largest department store?? I just don't see it. I guess they must be including the full size Ice skating facility, movie theater, health spa, and driving range into the equation which is misleading to say the least, the actual space devoted to the shopping area's is not that big, I would venture to say I've seen larger super Walmarts in the states.I was expecting more of a shopping mall experience with many different shops and brands to choose from but in reality it is 9 compact floors of the same over crowded, overpriced Shinsegae store brand, certainly not a place one would come looking for bargains as every single item is priced at the high retail level.One thing that is particularly annoying is the way the store is set up, for instance men’s wear is located on floors 3,4 and 5, but rather than having one floor dedicated to sportswear, another dedicated to casual wear, and one for dress and formal, all three floors are just jumbled together so if you find a shirt or jacket you like on the 5th floor and want to compare it to one on the 3rd floor you have to catch an overcrowded elevator or escalator to do so and it's up and down, up and down, the whole time you are there which I didn't find very amusing.The other thing I noticed was how crowded it was, not so much with actual paying customers, but rather hundreds of teenagers just there to socialize. So many that they would clog the isles and walkways while they stood there texting, whispering, giggling, etc. etc. doing what kids do. It’s fair to mention that it was a very cold day when I was there and that may be what brought all the kids inside but it was not a fun place to be, not user friendly at all, I honestly couldn't wait to get out of there..If you are just going for the cheesy novelty of seeing the world’s largest department store you’re likely to feel cheated as it’s just not that impressive."
Best shopping center ever!,We were there in 2009 and it had just opened that year. Most impressive and huge. We were able to ice skate and play golf. This was such a massive place that held just about anything a person could want!
biggest but...,"it is/was the biggest mall in the world (helped by a movie theater, ice skating, a spa and a driving range) but I can never seem to find anything I want there. When I go to other branches of the same stores they seem to have more elsewhere."
All in One,"Shinsegae in Korea is known to be the world's largest department store where it houses the top of the luxury brands with the latest fashion trends. It also houses local brands that feature clothing and shoes that are of good quality, fashionable and reasonably priced. It also has the largest book store called Kyobo book store and has a spa and ice skating rink as well. One thing that makes it a one stop shop as well is that if its your first time - you can try each of the restaurants that serve authentic sumptuous korean dishes. Where each restuarant showcases a specialty such as bibimbap, bulgogi, bogkuk ( blowfish ), Samgyetang ( ginseng chicken ) and Pork kimchi jjim."
A bit of Europe in Busan,"If you are longing for the familiarity of European brands, then look no further. An absolutely wonderful mall awaits you here. Top luxury brands, Prada, Chanel etc in addition to more main stream brands such as Massimo Dutti etc. Their cosmetics space is a dream also. And on your way out, dont forget to stop by Payard for some macaroons. There is also a personal shopping service for vip and serious shoppers. Staff are courteous and well informed, a great shopping experience."
