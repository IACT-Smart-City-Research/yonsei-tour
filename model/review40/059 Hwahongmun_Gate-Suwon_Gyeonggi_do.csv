Water Gate,Located above a stream this is the Water Gate for Hwaseong Fortress. Very picturesque and a good place to stop on the curcuit of the fortress walls. Not much water in the stream when we were there.
Very nice looking gate,It's a very nice looking gate. I would have liked it if there would have been more water running underneeth it.
Good to rest,"Locating above Suwoncheon Stream, this is a gate and a pavilion in eastern Suwon Haseong Fortress.It is huge and has a nice view. Good to rest for about an hour looking down Suwoncheon Stream.In the evening, it is said there are fountains and illuminations. It will be really beautiful."
Very nice view of the stream,"During winter you'll see the frozen part of the stream, follow where the water is coming from and you'll see a small lake nearby. "
Beautiful spot on Suwon city wall,"We visited Hwahongmun gate when walking around Suwon city wall. The gate is beautiful, the water was low when we visited but it was still lovely. I've seen from some other comments that you can take a walk from the gate along the river - we didn't do that, but I wish we had!"
Hwahongmun Gate & walk,make sure to walk along the pathway next to the water course. 2nd bridge downstream has the museum to left.
Definitely worth the visit while at Hwaseong,"If you are visiting Hwaseong Fortress, you should definitely stop by the north water gate. It is simply beautiful."
start point for a stroll alonside the river,"Meet some egret or heron alongside the river to enjoy some fresh air thank to the water (you can cross the water at some points through ""stone"" way) , beware of bicycles "
Beautiful gate with river,"For us this was the most beautiful part of the wall with the river running underneath the gate. We spent more time here than at any of the other gates, sitting by the river."
Fortress water gate,"Hwahongmun Gate is one of two water gates in the Hwaseong Fortress, it sits on top of a small bridge which crosses over Suwoncheon Stream and is located on the northern side of the wall. The gate marks the halfway point in the fortress wall hike if started at Paldalmun Gate. The details in the construction and decoration of the gate are worth a moment to admire."
One of two water gates in the Fortress,This is one of two water gates in the fortress area. The water wasn’t flowing strongly when we were there. Only through 3 of the openings. A few restaurants off to the side of the gate?
Good walk stop,It is good to ensure you church this out whilst at the fortress.A nice place to rest in the shade and admire the view
Make a wish,"Included in your entrance ticket, this is a must do to feel the bell's soft ring melting into the air while carrying your wish up to the miracle making place."
Very good 1 day trip destination,"Good track and scenery, garden and gate. Nice landscape, you can shoot bow and arrow and it will be fun. You can also get to taste traditional Korean tea. "
Pretty spot,This is a very pretty gate in the fortress as it straddles the river.You can walk over it and enjoy the ambience.
Part of Hwaseong Fortress,This gates is apart of Hwaseong Fortress. You can walk across the gate. When I walked there wasn't alot of water so view wasnt that good. But as a part of big Fortress it is nice.
Water Gate in the Middle of Suwon,Hwahongmun Gate is a water gate that located in the middle of Suwon. You can walk around the fortress which also pass this water gate. The small alley near this water gate is Haenggung Mural Painting Village.
Beautiful gate,First I visited the Gate on October and the weather was almost warm and the water flow was beautiful and so the Gate was very good looking. the next time it was on January. the weather was cold and the water was icy. It was also beautiful because the icy view had a very pleasant shape. very good visit
Midpoint to the Suwon fortress,"If you start either from the west or the east, this would be the midpoint mark. Worth a stop as the tranquil surround will help ease the senses. "
It's marvelous sitting in the gate floor.,One of the best I enjoyed at Hwaseong Fortress is sitting on a wooden floor in the gate and gawking at a stream facing cool wind.
during a weekend visit,"This is a stunning site to behold. There are walking paths, coffee shops along the way. Not to be missed."
One of the nice place to rest on Suwon fortress walk,"This is a water gate on Suwon fortress. Nice place to have a big break as the view is beautiful, big hall to sit, there is some water rather dry anywhere else along the wall. Cool place."
Very beautiful,Part of the walk around the wall. This gate is one of the most spectacular. You can access it directly from this location or do the entire walk. There are people dressed in period costumes which make a nice picture
Attractive sound of water,Awesome place with Attractive sound of water. You can spend lots of time here and enjoy the beauty of nature.
Worth a Visit,"As part of the City Tour, I visited this site. Nice architecture and in good condition. Gives you a bit of a sense of the history of the region"
Classic Korea.,The Hwahongmun Gate is beautiful but should not be viewed in isolation – rather as an integral component of the whole of the Suwon city wall which is almost 6 km in length (Suwon is the only remaining completely* walled city in South Korea). Each of its four gates are splendid in their own right and the two to three hour walk along the wall gives great views of both inside and outside. The fortifications were constructed in the late 18th century but a major renovation took place in the second half of the 1970s.*a small section remains unrestored.One should not overlook the stream which flows through the Hwahongmun Gate as following its course south (on foot) is also very pleasant – especially if one of the local herons is fishing at the same time.For the less athletic there is Hwaseong Fortress Train; a “Dragon” train tour which follows part of the route of the wall on its scheduled 3.2 km journey.
Beautiful fortress gate ,"Perfectly constructed for your viewing pleasure. The water flows through the gate and you can walk above the water and street. Or you can pass through alongside the stream. If you walk north, it leads to a beautiful lake with views of the fortress wall. "
Clean and seasonal,This area has a great balance of history and culture both old and new. From the walls themselves aging and restored to the streets where people sell and repair goods and even the stream you may find those relaxing or even on occasion washing items.You can always find a mix of culture and generations here. PS: Don't forget to check out the small pond outside the wall that blossoms and changes colour with the seasons. There is also a good outer wall photo opportunity here too.
Worth The Walk,Cool old fortress with a neat little park/pond behind the gate. Great pictures to take there especially at sunset. 
Great views from here,Great to watch men repairing some of the section below the walls. This is part of the city wall that many people walk along because it provides great views across the city.
Combination of the fortress,Dont miss this gate. It offer nice view over the city. You can still keep walking along the fortress to see more. But this is one of the hightlight of Suwon
Lovely area,While walking along the wall you will come across this Bridge/Gate. Many lovely photo spots nearby and don't forget to pop over to the little shop by the base of the steps to get some cheap snacks that done of which are very rare to find in regular stores these days. 
Very pretty,The gate and the view from the area pavilions was very pretty. It was a quick stop on the city bus tour.
A nice stroll along the riverside towards the Hwahongmun Gate,"It was a beautiful day when I visited, and it was possible to stroll along the riverside park, walking towards it from around the corner of the Hwaseong museum. It's actually just a few blocks from the palace. It reminded me of the Cheonggyecheon Stream in Seoul, except that this one is much smaller and more natural, much quieter and very relaxing."
Beautiful!,This is a great place to rest and relax from the calming river that goes through the gate. Especially after the long walk around the fortress. The size and the architecture of the gate is still astonishing. 
A must see part of the amazing 'Hwaseong Fortress' in Suwon.,"The Suwon River cuts across 'Hwaseong Fortress' from the North to the South. Water gates were installed on the north and south walls to allow the river to flow through. ""Hwahongmun Gate"" is the north water gate of the fortress, containing seven arches, constructed in varying sizes, to let the water through.It is a stunning attraction and has nice views down the Suwon River from inside the 'gate house'.Remove shoes before entry into the wooden floored hall. When I was there the water was quite low but still an impressive landmark and an area of Suwon's historic fortress well worth a visit."
One of the nicest gates,"This gate, in the north of the fortress, is one of the nicest because it has water flowing through it. It is quite close to a famous Galbi Tang restaurant that I have reviewed on TA as well. I would prob not come here on purpose but if you are going to the restaurant you should def check it out. Walk outside in the outer walls around this area too."
Rare water gate,"Hwahongmun Gate is a rare example of a remaining water gate, guarding the northern entry of the Suwon river. The Hwahongmun gate is built on seven arches and acts as a bridge as well as an artillery base.This gate and the immediate area is the most interesting part of Suwon (or Hwaseong) Fortress and it is located in the northern part of the fortress, about 15 minutes by car from Suwon Station."
Beautiful stream & garden,Here people can resting at tarditional Pavilion and can enjoy beautiful fortress & pond garden view
