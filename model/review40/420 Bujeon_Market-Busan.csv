During my dream trip to Busan.,I went with a co-worker. We ate fried fish and sides. There are many fresh seafood places along the strip. All are good.
Holiday,Nice local market in Busan near Ibis hotel. I can find the local food for breakfast during waiting a room for checking in. Enjoy to shopping and see the local life. Recommend 
Big traditional market near Seomyeon,This is a huge traditional market near Seomyeon which is one of top downtowns in Busan.There's nothing special and that makes this place special as other markets are touristic.
Nice place to shop,I was in Busan only for 5 days and I spent almost half a day shopping here. Fantastic bargains.I wish I had more time for shopping here.Good bargain hunting.
Huge bustling food market,"We enjoyed wandering and getting lost at Bujeon market. A proper local market selling fish, veges etc., not souvenirs. Busy during the day, quieter at night when business is winding down for the day."
"Bujeon Market, Busanjin-gu","Bujeon Market was very big selling all kinds of vegetables,fruits, meats, household things, clothes, seafoods and others, a walking distance from Seomyeon Underground Station. Definitely worth a look."
Local market worth a visit......,"This is a very ""local"" wet market, very different from the usual tourists markets.No frills, simple, messy ""come as it is"" stalls lined all over selling all kinds of wet market products. With some shops/ local food cafes as well.Interesting to visit to experience a locals setting. But frankly don't expect to buy much here."
Great Market,"Walked through Bujeon market ( Market of Memory) for hours fascinated by the collections of raw and cooked, live and dried, vegetal and animal, sea and land combinations - beautiful and colourful displays. A really excellent market - one of our best ever. No (western) tourists. No one disturbed by us taking photos - they are too busy to care and too practical to be superstitious. No one speaks English. Huge, clean, organized and - with all Korea - safe. Bought tempura like fish and shrimp on a stick - Garaesa Fish Cake - cheap $2 - and good."
"Wanna go local, come here","Seomyeon station, metro red line 1, Exit 15 - step out and ta-dah, the market. Plenty fresh fruits, veggies, meat, seafood, snacks - you name it, they got it. The outdoor clothes shop along the main road were also hot favourites - KRW10k for hiking pants, tops, etc.Apparently Bujeon ginseng market is close by - we didn't get a chance to visit due to time constraint."
Authentic Large Wet Market,"We went to this market almost daily(5 times) to shop for daily consumption and bring home. It was berry season and we bought all kind of berries daily to eat while visiting tourist spots.Pros :1) Extremely large market. Easily takes half a day. Many sections, from vegetables, seafood, dried food, meat, fruits, roots, sea weed, eating places, utensils and the like.2) Not expensive. Buy from vendors with display prices.3) Local market, not many tourist especially on a weekday.4) Clean and hygenic.5) 10 mins. from Seomyeon subway.Cons :1) Cash only.2) Map not available. May get confusing since there is no English signs.3) The wet market can get smelly after a while. 4) No GST refund facilities.It is a must see in Busan. Strongly recommend and will definitely visit again."
real Korean experience,i love going to Bujeon market whenever i'm visiting my sister in Busan. Real Korean experience . people are friendly and helpful.
My top priority for Bujeon Market,"I enjoyed shopping in this market. I will not leave Busan without coming to this market. Was here in Sept 2014 and now in Sept 2016. There are so much varieties, from fresh ginseng to seaweeds to food to fruits, etc. Bought what I wanted from this market. Discovered a well-known varieties of fish cakes restaurant in the market. Impressed with the clean & complete set-up cafe on the 2nd Floor."
Good food and authentic atmosphere,"One of the truly great markets in Korea. It's tough to find a market that is big enough to warrant a visit, and not so touristic so that it feels authentic. Bujeon Market hits that sweet spot. It has all kinds of foods, included lots of fish, fruits and vegetables. It's not expensive and food is fresh. It can get fairly smelly after a while, which can be a bit of a discomfort."
Fun visit with many interesting sights and smells,"A very large wet market with fresh food like seafood, meat and vegetables as well as dried food like nuts and grains. Small eateries too.Many side streets to explore. The ground is wet at most places so wear covered shoes.Good way of seeing how the locals live."
"Lots of fresh seafood, fruit and local food here..",A local market that open in the early morning until evening. Many cheap local fruit and food available at affordable price.
Bujeon Market,fabulous area full of hustle and bustle - look out for the stars on pavement with famous entertainers names - colourful large selection of market stalls 
Bujeon Market,Another amazing cultural experience in Busan. Be prepared to walk as you navigate your way through the vast amount of alley ways at this market. Definitely something to experience in Korea. 
Full of Delicious Korean Food!,"If you visit Busan, you must visit this market. You can find so many delicious fresh or ready-served korean fods with cheaper price! You also can find cheap souvenirs and suitcases"
Wet market,"Not far from Samyeon metro station about 10 minute walk. Visited in May evening. It is a traditional wet market selling meat, fresh seafood, preserved food, vegetables and fruits. Mainly locals patronizing here. Prices are reasonable and can be bargained if you know."
Lots of interesting items,Shopkeepers were happy for photos to be taken. It can be wet on the ground so wear closed shoes. Try some fish cake sticks!
Great market ,"This is maybe my favorite market in Korea. It's not really much different than other traditional markets, but I always seem to find really cheap and delicious fruits here, which I find can be hit and miss in Korea. If in the area check it out, but even though I love it I wouldn't recommend going out of your way to visit. "
Wet Market,"Seomyeon/Bujeon exit 3Another wet market in Busan, but this one has more dry goods. Bought some fresh ginseng here. Good to walk around 1-2 hours. "
It's a market,"If you have experienced Asian markets before, then this one will be nothing new on you. It is big, but it is only that factor that separates it from any other. If we lived in Busan, we would probably use it occasionally, but really, it's a market, albeit a big one."
One of the biggest markets in the world,"The Bujeon market is huge, it seems to they span across an entire suburb. There are stores and stalls selling so many things.Highly worthwhile if you want bargains or just to see where the locals go shopping.Has food, food stalls, pots, pans, at lights, selfie sticks... The list goes on.Worth meandering through if you like markets. "
Awesome market!! ,This market will captivate you the moment you walk in our around it. It's sheer size will amaze you and the quantity of goods is a sight to behold. Don't miss out. 
Asian Market Extraordinaire,"If you want to visit a classic East Asian market this is the place to go, The variety of products offered is amazing and the atmosphere is hectic by western standards. Accent is on food, many varieties of which aren't readily available in the States. The market is so vast that it's easier to get lost than in the Cairo bazaar, but just keep walking and you will come out somewhere and all you have to do is walk the perimeter until you arrive at where you came in. The only caveat is that deliverymen on motorbikes are slow to yield to pedestrians."
Interesting indoor market,"After checking with our hotel owner, I was told that Bujeon Market is open on Sunday even though many shops and some stalls are closed. Despite of that, we still have much to see and buy. We had our food at one of the stalls. There are so much varieties of dried and wet foodstuff, nuts, fresh ginseng, seaweed, seafood, vegetables, clothing, etc. We bought fresh ginseng, sunflower seeds, nuts, seaweeds, blouses, fruits, etc. We managed to get all we have intended to buy at this market. I highly recommend this market because in my opinion, if you come to this market, you need not go round hunting for your stuff at other markets. Somebody should have said that in this review so that we don't waste our time hunting our stuff at other markets."
Biggest Indoor Markets,"As we are staying nearby, we walked into the market by chance and wow it have so many stalls linking to Seomyeon Station. The markets were well maintained and interesting how the locals peddled their goods. The section were divided into different areas like one street are for fruits stalls where you can find all the fresh local fruit in season like Strawberries, Nashi Pears, Persimmon and Jeju Satsumas, sweet juicy and good price.The stretch where all the local herbs are displayed. The Fresh Ginseng in stacks and stacks. There are also available for sale in plates at 30,000KW for about 10 pieces. Delicious for making the Ginseng Chicken Soup. Springtime in Busan means lots of vegetables which are used to prepare soups and salads. There is a stall situated on the left hand side of the main entrance where you can witness the making of Kimchi. The ladies are so apt and fast, an interesting sight.Along the streets, you can find many ladies selling sweet potatoes, fresh carrots and other vegetables.A good visit if you are into the Korean Culinary as it has all the ingredients you need. look out for their fresh walnuts, pinenut and pumpkins seeds. Good price and healthy."
