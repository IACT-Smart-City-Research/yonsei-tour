Price not expensive,"Good for shopping n price very reasonable. This is the 2nd time I went there, will visit again next time"
Shopping,Not much to distinguish the centre from a typical South Korean underground mall beyond the Gangnam signage. 
overwhelmed but fun,"I had 1.5 hours to kill. I wove in/out of the stalls. but first, I remembered my exityou ca eat, have coffee, browse and negotiate. make sure you ask if it's korean or Chinese made. they often have extra supply inside, so dont get the hanging item.take photos of the whimsical shop names. the don't depict the actual store. "
Shopping mostly for women,Lots of trendy clothes. lots of the shops sell similar items but price difference isn't that much. Prices are negotiable. They do inflate prices if you are a foreigner especially on items without price tag. Pretty big and there are small restaurants and stalls if you get thirsty or hungry. Very convenient access to subway. You can also find skincare products like innisfree here. 
Yes shopping ,"Lots of shops selling mostly ladies wears, accessories, shoes and beauty products. There are few phone shops as well as some selling phone accessories. Much like the express bus terminal shopping Centre that we went to. Prices are comparable. "
Claustrofobic,I find the choice of shops disappointing. Mostly girls clothes and make up. Also because it is very crowded and with low ceilings it is rather claustrophobic. 
Located at the express bus terminal ,"Let me begin by stating this is not Gangnam Station Underground shopping. This underground shopping is known as the “express bus terminal” underground/GOTO Mall. For logistical purposes, it shares space with Shingase and the JW Marriott. I took a taxi to the express bus terminal and I was dropped off directly in front of the steps leading down to get to the underground shopping; follow the signs to underground shopping. The amount of shops here is quite overwhelming, but many do offer the same things, so it’s just about finding the best deals. Many items are advertised between 10,000 to 15,000 won. I purchased a pair of cute sandals for 5,000. I also purchased higher quality Korean fashions ranging from 29,000 won to 139,000 won; I am a shopaholic who loves a great deal, but will also pay top dollar for eclectic wear and one of a kind pieces. If you come with the intent to do a lot of damage then do bring an empty backpack or suitcase. You’ll thank me later!"
Long shopping underground street,"Long rows of shops between Express Bus Terminal Station and Banpo station. Most of the shops selling woman apparel and they are pretty similar. Handicraft shops and kitchen accessories, floral shops are located right at the end. "
Comfortable to shop around,"Given we came to Seoul during winter, it was nice to be able to shop in relative comfort underground. You can still find lots of handphone accessories, clothing, food, shoes, etc."
Lots of great affordable shops,"This is the place to go for affordable shopping in Gangnam, especially for women. Lots of women's clothes and skincare stores. There's even a Dunkin Donuts and Baskin Robbins. Only thing is, there is not too much variety in clothes and shoes. Lots of shops have the same stuff."
Underground City,"Aptly priced apparel shops abound in this area, with some coffee and fast food joints strewn across to make your shopping stroll a little bit more comfortable. Also, its a delight to walk this zone on extreme weather days, such as the one time I did with -8 Celcius outside, it was a comfy 20 C inside. The shops are sometimes selling the same stuff with slight variation in prices, so look around before you decide to go for the kill. Bargaining was not welcome, sometimes caused us to be 'blacklisted' from that particular shop, but we tried it anyways, not knowing when we would return next to Seoul. This area is connected directly to Gangnam subway station, and Exit 11 takes you straight to the 'Gangam Style' stage for some photo-opps (that last one was purely a tourism promo for Gangnam, albeit I don't get paid for it :P )Come up outside and plenty restaurants classy to chic, and multi-level, multi-brand, single-brand shopping awaits you. Go check this out for yourself when in Seoul. It just doesn't seem to go out of style, just like 'Gangnam...', yeah, you got it!!"
The fashion street,"You will be mesmerized by how the Korean people loves fashion. The place is awesome as it is filled with shops selling clothes, shoes and accessories. Here, you can also appreciate the Korean Pop Culture as plenty of shops selling K-Pop. Its a shopping heaven especially for fashion lovers. The location. it is within the subway station itself."
confusing yet thrilling market,"Its like a Thailnad Chatucak in Korea, but with over 600 shops selling tons of clothes and accessories, shoes and stuff, but since its winter period, and we dun need that much winter stuff, we only spent 30min brezzing thru. think if you come during Summer, the choices will be bountiful. dun be confuse with Gangnam underground as some call this Gangnam Underground shopping area, its actuall same as Express bus terminal underground and GOTO mall. (Gangnam station has another different area)"
It is awsome,Like you see I love to shopping and see other store and It has lots of store that with different cloths and things so I highly recommend you to go vist there
If you love chips and candies this is a store for you. Not a big selection tough.....,"Before you plan your trip to Seoul, please, please educate yourself first about dangerous air pollution. My advice do not come only if you have to. Shopping is not that great anyway. All stores carry the same items. Boring selection and poor quality. Waste of money and your time if you plan to come to Seoul for shopping. Look for other countries offering more variety, better prices and with safe air quality. "
Recommended shopping,"I was so happy when coming here, i like shopping and this place likes heaven for me. haha. I wnt there on weekdays, when they jus opend their shop.I only strolled in the underground shopping area, because it has cheaper price. If you had come to dongdaemun market, you will know that here is cheaper. When i was there, i only saw mostly locals and very very few tourist. They sell bag, jacket, shoes, souvenir, homegoods, artificial flowers, food, etc. I hope i can go back there and if you like me, I really recommend you to go there.PS: i tried bread there and it was good. I also ate lunch there and good!"
Not a bad place to escape the heat,"Its an interesting place to wander around, It was very hot and humid when I was here and there was definatly a reprive from it down in the shopping area."
Underground shopping experience ,Same shops as overground and similar prices. Shopping underground is just a different experience. Beauty products and clothing.
Interesting ,This is a lovely underground shopping experience. However similar products offered at many of the stalls. Also the prices aren't much cheaper than the other markets or stalls elsewhere. 
Crowded and not that cheap,Its more crowded and not even cheaper than buying from a big store else where. So watch out for the prices. I still love Young Depo underground shopping center
Shopping ,"Gangnam underground shopping is very convenient to access, it is right at the Gangnam station, there are many shops everywhere mostly sell women's clothing, and Korean brand cosmetics. Price are affordable. The casual dresses sold are the cutest. I really love shopping here."
Underground shopping for shopholics,"Big underground area to do shopping, open till 10 PM, lots of shops from garments to cosmetic. You can enjoy icecream or fruit juice while doing shopping. We tried bread also from one of the bakery shop inside and it was very good. "
Relaxing Shopping Experience,"Shopping here is relaxing. Saw some goods that are cheaper than Myeong-dong underground shopping area. Good to check out if you're in the area. Otherwise, its the same as the ones you'll see in Dongdeamun, Myeong-dong and the likes."
Tourist,Gangnam is a huge underground shopping area. It is lined with many many shops Clothes for women are really nice and keeping up to the fashion trend. Clothes are of good quality mostly ranging from 10000 to 15000 wons Attractive bags and shoes in different colours are available. Artificial jewellery and amazing hair accessories are available. The place is crowded and one can get confused as to where one is. Worth a visit once
Gangnam Shopping Area,"[For more food and travel journey please check on my Instagram @oppakuliner]If you like to shop some things here, this can be the alternative place. The price isn't that cheap anyway but they have various products from skincare, clothes and etc. I'm prefer Ehwa for shopping, but this one can be the option"
"HAD to make a ""Gangnam Style "" stop...""Hey Sexy Lady!""","Took the subway there and I was typical happy tourist Ready to see what PSY really was talking about...The underground shopping area was the best one of all the subway exits that I have seen. A much higher scale one than the rest around Seoul. While in Gangnam, you must do the "" Out -of-towner"" thing and go to the Gangnam Square between (exits 11-12) to take cheesy photos doing the PSY horse dance. Ha...I had a great laugh. Gangnam is considered the Beverly Hills of Seoul. Fun time there."
Worth a visit for Women Fashion Clothings,"Many many shops selling women’s clothings and shoes. If you are a shopaholic, this place is a must. Expect to spend :). Not for teenagers, kids and husbands though. They can hang around at Macdonalds on the ground floor while the ladies shop underground. "
Don’t fall for the hype,"Everyone goes on about this place, but don’t go out of your way to visit - just an underground shopping mall like you find at any major train station in the World."
Bargain shopping spree!,"If you're looking for the best deal of garments, this is the place! Located at Gangnam station. Things here are very cheap, most items are priced at 5,000 ~ 15,000, you could really get some real deals here."
Good deals,"Take the Green line to Gangnam station and you will see all the shops in the underground lined up in every hallway. It does feel a bit of a maze since shops are selling similar stuff and after a few turns, you might not be able to find the store again. Although we were at Ewha University area previous day and found that they had some really good deals too but the two areas do sell different stuff and if you have time, I would recommend going to both areas."
Gangnam style,We mostly visited here just to say we'd been here. Inspired by the Gangnam style song. Worth checking out if you're in the area.
Large shopping area with really good price,"The Gangnam Underground Shopping area is right at the Gangnam Metro Station (green-line). Once you exit the metro turnstile, you see it right away.There are hundred of shops on both sides of the corridors. They sell mostly women's clothing and accessories, shoes, some electronic, snack, bakery etc. There are a couple of convenient stores and Baskin Robins,Price is really good for those clothing. You can get a sweater or a skirt for 10000W. Spend some time there and do some diggings, you can find what you want for a very small budget.There are also some small restaurants that serve tradition Korea stew and dishes. You can stay underground shopping for a long time without surfacing."
Large area with lots of shops,"But mainly only basic fashion, mobiles and food.Nice experience, but once you are there for 15 min. you have seen basically all this underground area has to offer. "
Bargain Clothes and Accessories Shopping,"You can find awesome deals on high fashion and accessories especially purses, jewelry, sunglasses. Be careful it is easy to get lost if you are with small children "
Great place to shop!,Not to be confused with Express Bus Terminal underground shopping. Gangnam underground station is a great place to shop for bargains. We were in Seoul when we experienced unexpected hot weather. We purchased good quality shorts there for under $5.00 USD. Prices are great & you CAN find bargains if you really look for it.To get there from City Hall station: Take green line #2 and get off at Gangnam station (21 stops - about 39 min). Exit # 1 or 12.
Good shopping ,"Lots of shops and cafes. Shops selling sports items, clothing, socks, etc... Many different cafes, bubble tea, cold coffees and teas ..."
Everything under one roof,"Although the place is called Gangnam Underground Shopping Center but it is actually located at Express Bus Terminal train station. You can practically everything here from fashion items, cosmetics, and household items. The food court at each end of the shopping center also offer good variety of foods and drinks, including Gong Cha and Paik's Coffee."
Latest fashion at affordable prices ,"If you want a sense of the latest fashion trends in Seoul, visit Gangnam underground shopping mall. Reasonable prices with a variety of choices. An interesting way to pass time on a rainy day. "
Excellent place for shopping!,"The Gangnam Underground Shopping Centre is HUGE! There are so many shops here that you can spend the whole day shopping without realising it. If not careful, you may even get lost and end up walking around in circles.Majority of the shops sell ladies fashion, like accessories, clothings, lingerie and shoes etc. Only a few shops sell men and children fashion. There is a great variety of clothes and the prices are really cheap, affordable and value for money. As you walk around and explore more, you may discover more bargains. I am not one who buys things easily and yet, I ended up with quite a few items!Besides clothings, there are a few cafes for shoppers to rest their tired feet and grab a quick bite before continuing with their shopping spree.I highly recommend this shopping centre for the shopaholics, and those who require shopping therapy."
Shopping Fanatics Would Love This Place,"I stayed at a hotel in the Gangnam area and was informed that the Express Bus Terminal Underground Shopping Mall was the largest shopping arcade of its kind in Seoul. I visited this place slightly before lunch and it was really crowded. This entire arcade is actually 2 long parallel rows of shops, which is a shopping wonder for ladies with tons of clothings, bags, shoes, cosmetics, etc. I bought a few blouses for my daughter, which were reasonably priced (KRW10,000 to KRW15,000). There is a food court at the end of the mall where I had a bowl of spicy beef soup with rice, which was well priced.If you happen to stay in the Gangnam area and love shopping, it is worth checking out this place. You can easily spent 2-3 hours here. However, not recommended for guys as there is nothing much for them to buy."
Excellent place for a shopping experience,"Just to shop around at an underground, it is amazing. Plenty of shops with a lot of options to buy gifts. some recusants and takeaways are also there. A lot of cosmetic products shops with very high quality products at good prices. However, mainly women stuff to be found. Men can only shop for Mobile phone accessories and cloth."
Many shops!,"This is probably one of the largest underground shopping area. The lane never seems to end. The shops offer a great variety and selection of different types of shoes, clothes and bags! The prices are also very affordable."
Cheap place,Very cheap for shopping. Visit this place if you are in Seoul and want to buy cheap stuff. Don't buy with price they give you first time. You negotiate for lower price.
Initially impressive...,"...the you realise it's very repetitive - almost every 5th ""shop"" is a phone/phone case sales. Lots of womens clothing - pretty overpriced (according to my wife). There is the odd little gem of a place selling trinkets or food"
Window shopping,Gamgnam Underground shopping area!!!A lot of shop here!! How to go here by subway .. Exit express bus terminal station.. amd then you will see it!!
Many many things,"There's just so much to see and if there's no self-control, you probably end up spending a lot here! Those with self-control, it's quite a therapeutic place to just window shop :)"
Shop till you drop at Gangnam Underground Shopping Area,Good place to shop for cheap clothes and accessories at the Gangnam Underground Shopping Area. Most shoppers did not come out empty handed.
nice place when it's cold outside,"you really will enjoy this place when outside it's cold, but those shop on my opinion are not amazing, they are average shop and maybe more for locales"
Endless shopping...,"I have been shopping here since I was a kid before it was renovated. I was surprised by how cleaner and brighter it was when I visited again after many years. You can literally spend hours shopping and not know what time it is since it's underground! LOL This would be the perfect place to check out if it's raining or snowing outside. You can find everything from clothes, accessories, shoes, bags, cell phone accessories, blankets, interior decorations and etc. Unfortunately, most of the stuff is geared towards female shoppers and male items or quite limited. :( Prices vary but I find it affordable and they have trendy items. This place is huge so try not to get lost! :)"
Shopping paradise,This place is amazing for any shopping loving person. I got a lot of stuffs from jewelry to socks to cosmetic and clothes. Got some super deals. The place is hard to navigate exactly so I was happy I came with someone who had been there before.
"Renovated, busy as ever.","You can find virtually everything in this arcade (aka Express Bus Terminal Arcade) from stationary to clothes, from kitchen wares and fine dishes to furniture. Also a good place for little Korean souvenirs in the $15-range. Most places accept credit cards.The entire arcade has been recently renovated, which likely drove up rents as the prices have increased considerably in the last 5-6 years. However this is still a good deal as compared to discount department stores such as nearby New Core/Kim's Club. The place is always very crowded and people either do not watch where they are going or don't care. It is quite possible, however, to make you way through of this couple-of-kilometeres shopper's paradise without any incidents.Finally, the east end (by exits 14~16) has a decent food court with a rather famous teokkpokki place (Joss Teokkpokki) and a well priced (at 1,500 won per plate flat) kaiten sushi (Mahn Sushi).This shopping wonder world is located at the Express Bus Terminal subway station at the intersection of lines ##3, 7 and 9."
Must visit for shopping,"Its a little difficult to navigate, and you must remember the exit gate number from where you entered. Lots of cheap clothes, shoes, accessories. Be sure to bargain."
Let's bargain ,"Excellent place if you are a lady as you can bargain a great price for some good quality products.Find them in nearly all underground stations but with varying degrees.Not so much of variety for men, but you can always pick some local products from the local shops or some souvenirs as well."
Massive,"You can't see one end from the other. 2 parallel lanes. My friends are crazy over this place but it didn't work for me. Came out of the mall empty handed. The things are cheap but so is the quality. A little see one see all because they tend to sell very similar things. Having said that, there's a variety of things ranging from household products to fashion items. It's a great walk for a rainy day..."
Shopping,"Geared for female. Cheap shipping clothes starting at 5000 won. Once you exit the gangnam subway you're there. It's the whole underground exit area (exit 1-12) a lot of places sells similar stuff so if you have time, walk around to find the cheapest but all process are reasonable and good quality. I bought sweaters for 5000 won n 10 000 won. Purses for 18000 won. They are all made in Korea. If you're planning on a shopping trip, bring a backpack/bag of some sort to put all your goodies in so you don't need to carry a million bags. Happy shopping! Shops sells :clothes, bags, accessories, shoes. There's also food there. "
Great bargain area if you're a woman not so much if you're a man,"Just like Sinchon, the Gangnam Underground Arcade is geared mostly to women. There isn't much for men. If you go out exit 9 you'll get to the main drag which has most of the major brands (Zara, Uniqlo, Spao, Muji). They even had a branch of Massimo Dutti (Zara's high end line). Feel free to take a look but if you're a guy, you're wasting your time. "
Shopping Center,"There is a lot of stores, mainly for girls. It gets crazy packed and hot on summer down there. Good location in Gangnam, close to so many stores and restaurants"
Correct Shopping center,"Not so easy to find, this Shopping center has a lot of shops, mainly for girls.Of course, you will often find the same products but, if you like spending time for shopping you will enjoy."
My most favorite shopping mecca in Seoul,"In a day, I've been to Hongdae, Ewha and Gangnam but I could really say that this is my most favorite shopping place in my entire Seoul trip. The clothes here are of wide variety and mostly at very affordable price from 5k-20k won depending on the design. I bought majority of my fashion hauls here. And to top it all since I already did a lot of shopping the entire day, there are lockers where you can place your bags for the mean time so you can shop for more! Haha.. i bought office pants, casual clothes from 10-15k won. Its still within the budget if you are looking for a good quality of clothes. In the Philippines, the quality of goods that you can buy for the same amount is just very low end. There are also snack stations but not quite a lot of restaurants. You can find more restaurans in the main Gangnam area but not un the underground shopping center. You can also haggle but they rarely give in unless they are about to close their stores. Over all, it was a great experience. Made in Korea products are the greatest! ❤️"
Shopping paradise for girls.,My fiancee and I were searching up and down for this place and we can't seem to find it. We even asked the staff in the tourist info centre and she guided us to some other mall which was not this place. We eventually found this place after 2 hours of searching. It is located at line 9 station of Express Bus Terminal which was where we first alighted but we went looking for it at line 3 and 7 station.This place is a shopping paradise for girls as 99% of the sale items are meant for girls. there are 2 long rows of shops where you can spend hours shopping. Items are relatively cheap.Be sure to check it out.
Korean fashion ,"You'll find many many shops. But they all sell the same clothes. Sometimes you'll feel like you've seen it before, and yes, you saw in the shop next to it.There is not much variety but if you want the basic korean clothes you'll get them.Important: they don't allow you to try the clothes!!!!! (Koreans use a lot of make up so they don't want the clothes to be dirty)."
Fantastic range locally made fashion and accessories ,"A huge mall in a comfortable AC and underground shopping area. The unique appeal is, fashion and accessories are locally made, something you would love to pick up one two items. "
Underexpectation,"Not fun can,t bargaine , the cloth are cheap but shoes are not . Actually , compare to hong dae thisplace sell cheaper only 900 won for the same cloth n compare to dongdaemun it was cheaper only 1000 won "
Very interesting concept,"This was very interesting to visit, the concept works well especially on rainy days.It can be a little confusing as to what directions you are going, but there are signs in English, Korean, and Japaneses. Also, in some cases the quickest/easiest way to cross the street is to cut through the market. "
cheap knick knacks,"This is suppose to be the Longest underground shopping area. Even though it was quite dark, there were so many knock-knacks for sale like lingerie, phone covers, facial masks, shoes and clothes - all at very reasonable prices. Even those who do not wish to shop will get tempted!!!"
Not much too see,"The mall is located in Gangnam Station of Seoul Subway Line 2. This place reminds me of the People's Park Complex in Singapore. Mostly selling ladies stuff; clothing, shoes, accessories and facial products. There are a lot of shops to explore but most of them are selling similar items. If you have time, do explore the mall slowly, compare prices first before buying. Prices are reasonable and some shops do offer discount if you pay in cash or buy in bulk but don't expect too much on the quality of the clothing and shoes. This is just another underground shopping mall linked to the subway. You won't need to travel all the way there if there is already one located near you. Not recommended for family with young children as I personally find the place is bit stuffy."
Just another shopping alley," I am not a shopping fan, there are aisles of shops underground selling almost anything you can imagine.One can really immersed in this frenzy and enjoy every minute of bargain hunting, or just ""window shop"" walking through, there is no end! How much can your eyes absorb?Without PSY- the ""gangnam style"" guru, this is just another shopping alley underground linked to Metro"
Alright for shopping (ladies only),"This is a huge shopping area, 99% of which is catered for the ladies. Lots and lots and lots of shops, but they really mostly sell very similar clothing and similar shoes. I was told that a lot of these shops buy their clothing in bulk from Dongdaemun and resell them here. So, don’t immediately buy something you lay your eyes on, walk around and have a look first. More often than not, there would be another shop selling an identical item for slightly cheaper (5000-10000won cheaper). Also, unfortunately a lot of the clothes come in one size (free), so if you are not super skinny, most of the time it’s a bit of a risk buying stuff here. Plus there aren’t any areas in the shops where you can try the clothes on. Some of it also look pretty low quality and cheap to me, but if you have the time and patience and you’re looking for something affordable, this is an alright area to shop in."
BEST place to get great deals,"I asked my hotel where the best place is to shop for domestic fashion (made in Korea) and they recommended this place. So glad they did. I went there TWICE and shopped too much that I ended up having to buy a new luggage! Everything is so cute and reasonably priced. If you pay cash, you can negotiate the price. Everyone is super friendly and polite. 99% of the stores are for women though. Not sure if it's the best place to shop for mens. I bought cosmetic, clothing and shoes. My fav clothing store is called Soul. I bought a bunch of stuff from Nature Republic for skin care stuff. You can also find the cutest shoes for really cheap. The quality is excellent. Don't forget to try out the food as well!! They have small restaurants and also vendors with only stalls (excellent snacks). I had something on a stick (made of some type of flour) which is so delicious. Only for a dollar! Definitely go check it out if you have time!"
2 Long parallel rows of shops selling mostly clothing.,"It is actually located in Express Bus Terminal Station. 2 really long parallel rows of shops selling mostly clothing. when you walked till the 2 ends, you can find food there. really a place for ladies. clothing starts from ₩5,000 (some from ₩2,000). at the one end there are shops selling house deco products like wall paintings and clocks."
One of many underground shopping malls - with deals,"Seoul has a couple of underground shopping malls, but I only visited 3 of them. Gangnam station's one is pretty similar to the rest. You would not be missing a great deal if you skipped this one and went to the others. The only big difference? I found a few more competitive stores that had drastic cuts (5000-8000 won instead of the usual 10,0000-15,0000 sale price) and different styles of clothing on sale instead of the usual street/chic/femme wear around."
Convenient underground shopping in Gangnam,"Went there because I was at Gangnam Station after going to the Samsung D'light building. Very convenient underground shopping most commonly sold goods are clothing, accessories and cosmetics (mainly woman's favourite products)."
Very good place for shopping!!!,"Great shopping experience!! Clothes made in Korea have good quality and the prices comparing to this quality were lowIn there you can find clothes,shoes and skincareTry skinfood is one of my favourite brands for face creams"
shopping and food,"had a great experience discovering new foods and fashion , would recommend a visit to central Seoul and the food was just awesome !"
Shopping spree to find cheap buys,The trendiest fashion and negotiable cheap buys can be found at the Gangnam Subway underground shopping area. Near to the Gangnam station is the Kukkiwon World TKD HQ which I visited the Taekwondo museum (very small and not well maintained). There is a Mooto shop down-slope of the Kukkiwon HQ where I ordered my custom-made black belt for only SGD 29 (in Singapore it would have cost SGD40+).
Shopaholic's Heaven!,"It's located at Express Bus Terminal Station. It offers the best price of clothing, shoes, accessories etc in town. Yes, much more cheaper than some places in Seoul like Hongdae, Myeongdong or Insadong. Any shopaholic sure spends at least 3 hours here, lol, like me! "
Shopping haven for ladies,"This is a good place to hangout if it is raining outside. Stalls after stalls from left to right on both opposites. Menswear shops can be counted by one hand, so its a shopping haven for ladies mostly. At the end of the underground shops are some eateries. Simple delicious Korean food in our opinion."
Lovers paradise for shopping,"For those looking for Korean souvenirs this is the best place to go for good prices and lots of variety for example, ☺ you can get Korean ginseng tea Korean magnets spend everything Korean they even have cell phones in case you need them to some of them even locked unlocked so if you're looking for a traditional Korean goods this is a great place go!!!!"
Another shoppers stop!!,"Like other major shopping area in Seoul this is another place you would love to visit, but again same problem like other areas, they good only for skinny people!But visit to this place is an experience in its own. Its connected to the station so nothing you will lose to spend an hour or so! May be you will find a good pick for yourself or your friend!"
Excellent stop on the way to tourist atractions,"Conveniently located in Gangnam metro station, you can find plenty of shops - excellent especially for buying Korean cosmetics (face, hand and foot masks are really good)"
Shoppers Heaven,There are hundreds of shops in this underground area and shoppers can spend about 2-3 hours roaming around looking for the best deal.
Perfect,"I love it that this place has sooooo many fashion stuffs with affordable price.yocan also find cosmetic shops,coffee shops,bread shops,cellular phone shops,bag shops,even underwear shops.Easy to find.So huge for an underground shopping area.Along with dongdaemun & ewha woman's university shopping area,this place is the best shopping area.."
Lots of variety & cheap shopping,"Located conveniently in the air conditioned area at Gangnam Station Exit 2,7,8,9,10,11,12. Lots of clothes to choose from. Good quality and cheap pricing. Shops may sell similar items so if there's no new pieces in 1 shop, go to the next one. We did most of our clothes shopping here."
Nice!,"It's so nice to shop here. There are a lot of shops that have so much to offer! If you have the skills, you can even bargain on prices! Also, there are nice restaurants for good and affordable food"
For females,"Most of the shops are for females. So for me, this is really a 2.5 out of 5. Plus, I only stopped in this station to walk to banpo bridge. I hated how crowded and hot it was. But if you're a female and likes to shop, you might like this place."
The most annoying part of the subway in Gangnam!,"The most annoying part of passing through Gangnam subway stations is this shopping mall. If you have a few minutes swing by and have a serious look at the stores, but if you're ever in a rush you will hate it!"
Conveniently located shopping mall,This mall is conveniently located at the centre of many of the subway train lines. You will be able to access many of Seoul's attractions from Gangnam station. The mall itself has a wide variety of items on sale and there are opportunities for bargain even though some of the shops are a bit pricey. Overally the mall has a wide selection and a very convenient location.
"Do not buy yet, take a stroll first","The reason I said do not buy yet, is that there are clothes with the same design and material but the price can differ about 5,000-10,000won.. So shop smart before making the extremely fast decision"
A Bazaar worth visiting,"Travelling to many countries, I have not heard any streets underground selling their food or clothes underground. I felt amazed and different over which I never would want to feel that again. But what is important is that, I would be able to buy a lot of items, such as socks and goods for a price below 1000krw. A price reasonable for tourist who fancy a rich design."
Lots of choices belowground,Lots of choices belowground. I got in on some sportswear and EPL football team patches for a couple of bucks each. A bargain for those who want to sew them on their own stuff.
Shopping where the locals shop,"Almost 2km in length, the gangnam underground shopping area (mainly selling clothing with a handful of bags, accessories and cosmestic shops) keeps you occupied for hours (that is if you are a shopperholic). Most of the items are priced at 10,000 won (approx SGD 12) which vividly reminded me of the Singapore's outdoor shopping area - Bugis street. However, some shops offer the same clothing. Comparatively to Dongdaemun, I preferred shopping here as firstly, my shopping 'companions' were locals, secondly, the sale assistants were friendlier and lastly the affordability here. "
Exciting place to visit,Gangnam station is quite a large station stretching a few blocks. The underground is full of shopping and eating areas. We spent several hours there with my wife looking for beauty products and clothing. Amazing the level of activitiy down there. One night we were passing through the underground about midnight and I was surprised the number of people there. Shops were closed but people were going to of form the subway. We felt completely safe.
"If you love shopping, this is the place for you","Talk about fashion shopping, Korea gangnam underground shopping reallly is the place. You can't see the end the shop lots are way long and lots for you to see and buy. Clothes, shoes, beauty... oh my, I missed this place already. :)"
Wow!,"Couldn't believe how big this underground shopping is!. We walked from one end all the way down to the other end & back. Nicer quality clothes.. mostly for women, but a good prices."
Don't miss this place....one of the best malls in Seoul,"This is a huge underground mall, with rows and rows of shops.The place is well designed, bright and the shops well done & nice environment.You can find many things here especially for ladies. Alot of ladies clothings, shoes, accesories, even home decor & mobile accessories. Prices are reasonable but look out for offers stuff. There are quite alot of offers & they are really cheap! And quality is good! Bought 2 mobile phone covers on offer at half price. Quality is very good- made in Korea."
Shopping ,"The place is very nice you can find anything,the only thing thing is that it's more a labyrinth,but if you go there a couple times you will find your way that was the way I start to enjoy shopping there,there a lot of cosmetic and skin care shops very good price and good quality I highly recommend the Korean skin care "
Only good for females (Of if need a phone case),"Most of these shops here sell womens clothes or cellphone cases. If you are a male, you can get some high quality phone cases, or some good food. Other than that, there would be no reason to visit here as a male."
Good Deal Shopping,If you're looking for some good buys at affordable prices then try this place out... There are lots of things to buy but mostly for ladies and I was really having fun just going from different shop I even bought some cheap shoes around 5000 won each and the quality looks fine that is if you're not into branded clothing.... But during the afternoon and evening the place gets too crowded I recommend you go there before noon time....
Big shopping maze,"It's like getting lost in a maze. Things are more or less similar. Clothing store, bags, hand phone, hand phone accessories, ladies accessories, socks, beauty products galore. Make sure you remember which exit / entrance you came in. "
Big and confusing!,"It is quite big, you can do anything from eating to shopping and they remodeled since I was there last time!+ Good remodeling the space is much better utilized + Prices are okay+ Haggling is possible+ Good for women+- A lot of people during the weekend- Can be confusing to know where you are.- No high end shopping- Bad for men"
One Location for all,This place has everything...from socks to furniture. All of us went different directions to see and get what's one keen. There are lots of cafes to rest the tired legs. But most food are Korean style.It's get crowd after noon. Easy to just spend a day there.
Good experience ,"Heard a lots about this place and finally we come. Even the local they even don't know which station to alight. Alight at Express Bus Terminal and follow the sign and it will bring you there.Some of the shop owners are not friendly and inpatient. When you asked them about the prices they will except you will want to buy. One of the owner she was so friendly where she automatic gave us discount even we did not ask. Need to be there early if you really want to shop. The shop will close around 9.00pm some even early. Besides clothing, bags, there were lots of nice home decors. We really enjoyed shopping here."
Busy but nice,"If you like underground shopping centers then you will like this one too. It was very busy on Friday night. Nothing super special though, but a nice shopping experience."
Heaven for cheap but quality women accessories and stuff,"Half a day should be spent here as 'girls' will go crazy shopping for bags,clothes and accessories...I ended up with 15 bags which cost only a mere KRW5000 - KRW10000 each...thats cheap considering the quality and design that I cant find in Malaysia. Socks and accessories are as cheap as KRW1,000. theres also food sold at the far end of it where you can eat spicy Teoppoki. But guys...sorry theres not much choice for shopping stuff for you here..."
Metro Line 2,"Not really worth to come all the way here if u not staying nearby. Low quality cheap ladies clothes & some good one, mobile phone & ladies accessories, bags, pouches, cosmetics beauty products, food, socks etc ... Walk further u can find Paris Baugette, quiet area to take a good break. But socks highly recommended to buy in Myeodong, lots of cute socks made in Korea. Cosmetics buy in Myeodong too as its highly competitive & u get lots of free gifts for yr purchase."
Mainly ladies clothings,"Almost nothing to buy for boys and men. Most items example Korean style skirts are small and medium size. If you are large or even medium size, I don't think you can find much that can be fit into here. Shops after shops selling tops, dresses, skirts, handbags Etc.. Starting from about 5000 won to many items at 10000 won per item. Read review there are 2 underground shopping, we went to the one below Express Bus Terminal Station. It is called ""Gangnam Terminal Underground Shopping Center""."
Clothes that you cannot try,"The Gangnam underground shopping area is pretty much the only thing about Gangnam, since outside of it there are only offices (see pictures). You will find many shops, most of them selling the same stuff again and again, especially one-size-only clothes that you won't be allowed to try on, and of which you won't be able to identify the composition since there is no labeling for it, which is why I didn't buy anything apart from some cute socks. It gets far too busy for my taste, and - as it is the case almost everywhere is Seoul's underground areas, sticky and claustrophobic.I also went to the famous Samsung D'light shop, only to discover that the prices for the Samsung products are not displayed but are kept secret. When I asked the price for a Samsung Note 3, I was shocked to hear that they wanted some 200 GBP more than what I would pay in the UK. The impression is that they keep the prices secret to rip off people (if they know you you pay less, if you are a tourist or they don't like you you pay more) - having said that, it's not only Samsung being so secretive about prices, it's something very annoying that you will find almost everywhere in Seoul, so much for free market! General advice: do not buy electronics in Korea as they may be cheaper back home, and always compare prices."
See it if you like shopping,"A huge maze of shop after shop after shop. However one observation - the products/clothing in all the shops are the exact same or very similiar. A lot of the same types of shops e.g. Spectables, cheap clothing, phone accessories, right beside each other, so overall quite repetitive. Safe to shop in, no difficulty, always busy, potentially no option to try on the clothes in some places. More for females."
follow the right way here,Was researching on more shopping area and chanced upon Gangnam Underground Shopping. Pls go to the correct subway station. There are many misleading reviews that gave direction as 'Express Bus Terminal' station which is a totally different place. (not worth going at all)Was wrongfully lead there by reading review. The correct station is 'Gangnam' if you are looking for Gangnam underground shopping. Download the metroid hd app to track easily from point a to b by subway. Many shops here at very competitive prices.shop till u drop 
Underground treasure,How could it take me so long to discover this place?Pure shopping pleasure which stretches like forever underground.
