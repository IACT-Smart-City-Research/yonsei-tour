"Great way to visit the city, cash only","My husband and I were in Seoul only for a day and figured we would go around the city with the subway which was 2 blocks from our hotel. Very clean, efficient and easy to get around. The only negative comment is that we could not buy tickets with a credit card so we had to get out of the station and find an ATM to get cash. Since our next stops on this trip were in countries with a different currency, we were hoping we would not have to convert money to Wons and use our credit card only."
Most convenient way,"Seoul metro was too good.It connected each and every area.Just carry a metro map along with you for checking out stations,transit,exits.We were there for 4days and used metro to the fullest.we used taxi only thrice that too for nearby places.Everybody is ready to help you even there is a language barrier.Just show them the place on map,they would help you out.This is the best ever public connectivity services I have ever seen.Have an happy stay at Seoul.For 4 days,we topup the card with ₩30,000 and this was sufficient."
Seoul Metro super Nice,I had got a few times chances to take the Seoul Metro while I travel in Korea. It was so cool. I am sure that Seoul Metro ranked Top 1 around the world.
Easy-peasy ,"The Seoul metro is a sparkling clean, economical and very easy to navigate! it can be a bit crowded at rush hour, but the riders are quiet & respectful of fellow rider’s space."
Efficient clean and modern,Don’t hesitate to use the subway even you don’t speak Korean a it’s written in English as well and very user friendly! 
Underground in the Underground,"The Subway or Metro to the Museum is well organized. In the hotel they explained me how it works and prepared with this information I bought a ticket and went into Korea underground. Stations are indicated in Korean and English so it helps otherwise Korean people are very open and friendly to show you the way . Do not throw your ticket away because at the end you get a refund of € 0,50 , very sustainable."
Best and safe mode of transport,"The metro in Seoul is really great value for money. It is convenient with stations close to most attractions and shopping areas. And it is fast and punctual! I downloaded an app called Naver Map, which gives you details to plan your route in advance. Use it and I promise you will not get lost."
Easy to navigate,"Clean, efficient, inexpensive and easy to get around using the Metro. Signage, verbal notices ( in English) make it easy. Don’t forget to turn your ticket back in after the trip to get your deposit back."
So cool,It was so cool honestly all i need to do is learn hangul and ill be a pro...but it is so cheap and so easy to use...but you have to be fast pace you dont want to miss your train.
First class subway,Nothing too spectacular...not like the subway stations in Moscow but an efficient subway system that covers so much of the city. Easy to navigate and a cheap way to get around!
Most efficient metro on earth?,"The lines are well though out, sufficient amount of cars, and very quick between trains. They are rarely over capacity crowded, but almost always standing room only. Cheap, efficient, clean, great metro. "
User Friendly ,The subway is extremely easy to use and the local people are always willing to help if you are confused. I used the subway to visit my brother-in-law in Osan and to get to the airport. I highly recommend anyone visiting Seoul to use the Metro during your stay. 
Outstanding City Connect Service!,"Buya card, recharge to at any Seven-Eleven outlet and you are good to tour the city without any hassle of bus or taxi!! Almost any corner of Seoul city can be reached by this service. Very comfortable!"
"Great metro system, best I ha e experienced globally, clean, informative and punctual, no issues for non Korean speakers","I’d advise all visitors to use the metro to get around, it’s inexpensive, clean, musical, and we’ll sign posted to all locations, buy yourself a plastic tmoney or another card and top it up at any party station with notes, even easy to do in Korean but it does provide English too. Many stations are well equipped with clean toilets, shops, shoe repair and cash machines. No one eats our drinks on the metro trains. People are generally quiet during the journeys. Plenty of lifts for people to use. Many stations do start to close from 23:00 on wards so download the app for the metro as you can put the times off your trips in the app. Lots of free WiFi too. "
Brilliant ,Get a Tmoney card and this is so easy to use you just top your card up every now and then but it's so cheap you won't have to often. It's so clean and quiet and on time. Theres also shops and food venders down there as well so worth a look round 
Best metro system I've ever used ,"I've used metro systems in several cities but this one takes the cake. Connectivity is excellent and station density depends on the population density around the station so in the heart of Seoul you're never more than a ten minute walk from a station. I found that I could get almost anywhere in the city with a maximum of one train change. Trains are frequent and maps and directions are very easy to understand, even for foreign visitors. The only downside is that the last trains are around midnight and even earlier on weekends. "
You Can Get Anywhere With this Metro for Cheap,"I’ve been completely lost not knowing what to do and some nice Koreans who spoke perfect English have helped me before. They even shared their WIFI hotspot with me so I could contact my work. They have an app that is very useful too. Other metros should come here and copy this system. Korean people are very well mannered, but they may be annoyed with you if you are loud like me."
"Clean, frequent but busy","Like any major city, the subway is hectic. But in Seoul, we always felt safe, and most stops are quite clean & modern."
Very Extensive,"Such an organized subway system. Usually on time, I love the safety measures they have in place so that people don't jump off the track (something that happens very often in Toronto). The underground system is also very extensive, you can go shopping along the walkway before going down to the platform at many stations. Absolutely incredible! Make sure you know the right exits at most stations since you can have more that 5 exits at many stations."
"Only CASH, otherwise a bargain !","Very easy to use. Take the metro from airport to the city, very fast , within an hour 42 km to Seoul Central station for only 7,5€Ticketing machines easy with excellent english do it yourself for dummies like me.In case of questions , everybody wants to help you, sometimes excellent English , sometimes broken , but easy to do. Very very clean and excellent maintained.Buses are also convenient, in the metro reserved places for pregnant ladies.So going to Seoul, use the metro."
Very good,Very good experience. English signs and clear information. Nothing to be worried as an foreigner. Also cheap.
Excellent system - but bring cash!,"It's a very modern world-class transit system, as many other reviewers have noted.A couple observations:- The ticket machines don't accept cards. Bring cash! (cards are accepted pretty much everywhere in Korea, so this was a surprise)- Often no staff at each entrance/exit, so potentially nobody to help you if there are issues Note, the Korean metro systems seem accessible with one pass. This may be helpful for people used to Japan where lines are run by numerous different companies across the country with their own passes and fares that may or may not inter-operate (even within one city)."
Great metro lines,Timely accurate and fast to get you where you're going. Sometimes that journy can take a significant amount of time as the city is so large.
Easy way to get around in Seoul,A tourist metro card works on buses and subway. The Naver map app tells you exactly what bus or subway to take to get to your destination. You sometimes have to put the destination in in Korean (copy paste from Google search).
Best metro system in the world!,"Seoul has the best metro/bus system I've ever used. Make sure to buy a pop card before hand! Also, Naver maps is a great app to use and is English friendly (which some apps are not)."
Fairly easy to use,"I no longer live near large cities with subway systems, so it took a beat to get used to this vast subway system. Fortunately there are apps available to help you navigate with relative ease. Plastic transit cards are available for purchase and it's easy to replenish. There are lots of stairs everywhere, elevators not so much, but they are available. Signs do have English subtitles, but we did find ourselves on platforms going in the opposite direction from what we wanted. We didn't see many attendants, but asked college-age people (who spoke English) for assistance when needed. "
Convenient,There are so many lines in Seoul and basically it covers most of the places which tourists most probably visit.
Get Kakao Metro too,"The metro out here is so reliable and cheap. Using the Kakao Metro app made it so easy to navigate Seoul. I went to Bukhansan, Lotte Mall/Aquarium, and the War Museum using the metro. This paired with the Navar App and you will almost always be able to get around without getting lost. "
Convenient way to go from A to B,Cheap and easy to use. Whit T-money card you can use the subway without thinking about the right fare and spending time at the ticket machine. Just go through and scan the card entering and leaving.
"Very convenient, reliable and extensive","When I visited Seoul I always took subway if I could. It is fast, reliable and can reach most places. You may need to transfer between different lines. I recommend using KOREA TOUR CARD or tMoney card. You can easily recharge the card at any subway station using vendor machines. But you have to use cash to charge the card."
Easy,"We bought T-money cards at the airport which we could then use on the AREX all-stop train into Seould and on the whole of the subway system (just like an Oyster card in London).We found it very easy to find our way around the network, although there were very long walks in some stations to change lines, and it was very cheap (about £5 per day)."
Excellent and easy to use,The subwAy is inexpensive and easy to use. All of the lines are color coded and all signs are in English. We took it everywhere in the downtown. Best way to beat rush hour traffic. Costs 1400 for a basic ticket.
Week long holiday in Seoul with daughter.,"Very efficient transport system. Bought T-money card from shop in airport and loaded card at one of numerous machines available in all the stations . Clear and simple instructions can be selected in English. First journey was from Incheon airport to Jongno-gu district but we used the subway many times throughout the course of our weeks stay. Very easy to navigate and lots of information available in all the stations regarding destinations and which line to take. Machines are also available to refund money still left on card before leaving Korea. Can be used for various forms of transport and even noticed a swipe pad in our airport taxi on our way back to Incheon. Very impressed with the service and noticed how clean the stations, platforms and trains were. Also very cheap to use."
Very quick and on time , Wry efficient service with regular trains that run on time. You can get everywhere in the city by the train!
Most convenient way of transport in the city,Easy and efficient mode of transport. Colour coded and signs in English . Huge and not many escalators in most stations. 
Very efficient!,"The Metro system in Seoul is very convenient and easy understand. Get a T-Money card, fill it up with money, and you are set.A great and affordable way to explore Seoul."
So easy to use,"Once you download the Metro App you are all set. The announcements and signage are in both Korean and English. Rather than having to follow each line to the end to find out which way the train is heading, it tells you above the platform door. Seoul is confusing to navigate. The Metro makes it so much easier."
Excellent transport system ,Very easy to use- make sure you buy a rechargeable T money card in a convenience store or at any station (cash only) 
Fantastically easy way to get around this huge city,"Get a T-money card, load up some credit on it and off you go! Seoul is huge and the metro system must be one of the biggest in the world. It is really the only sensible way to get around the city. Just remember which entrance you need to get back to your hotel!"
"Fast, clean conveniences ","Take some time to study your detonation and look at train directions. Unlike Hing Kong and London, Seoul's subways are linear not circular. On the pillars you can find stop in both directions (normally at the foot of the stairs) tells you the stop each train takes (leftside / rightside)The ticket vending machines offer Korean English and Japanese maybe Chinese but I was not paying attention lolI tried to dump my coins but after ₩2,000 it spit them out and I had to start over, lesson learned. It did take ₩1,700 You pay a deposit for the card and on exit the platform and swipe your card, there is a machine on deposit your used cards for a 500 refund "
Very convenient to travel,Can travel to all places with the metro. Using the kaokao metro app can help u to travel easily. Just take note of the exits as to see clearly the destination as it will leads to different places.
The Seoul Metro is fantastic.,"The cities metro system is great, one of the best in the world, there are stations everywhere. Clean, safe and very affordable. Announcements and visual displays in Korean and English, used it all the time. "
Fantastic Mode of Transportation,The Seoul metro was always timely and clean. You don’t need a car to navigate around Seoul. That said the subway does not have all the ADA friendly amenities so be prepared to walk up stairs.
Great system,"A well organised system and very cheap! Signage is clear, colour coded and in Koean and english with announcements also in chinese and Japanese. Never waited more than 5 min."
Easy to use,"even though a lot of the signs are in Korean, we found it easy to use. download one of the tourist apps and it helps with the stations. use the card to tap in and out"
Easy to use,Very easy to use once you get a T money card. It is very efficient and goes all over the city. Clean and only busy at certain times on certain lines. 
Mr,"With the help of certain app(hanchao if you can read chinese), i can go to most tourist attractions or shopping malls by just seoul metro. "
Efficient and clean,One of the best MRT networks in the world. Trains are constant and clean. Some stations are located pretty far away from train platforms so be weary of that.
Very clean; very timely,This is the cleanest subway I’ve ever been on. The trains run on time and the signs are in Korean with English beneath. This makes navigating your trips easier. 
Friendly for Non-Korean Speaking,"The Metro has extensive network to cover Seoul. Direction, station name and announcement in the train are provided in English and Korean. Make sure you install Korean navigation map (Naver or Kakao), because google map doesn't work here.Get T-Money card for easier commuting.Some older station exits doesn't have escalator, so might be challenging for elder people"
It gets you where you are going,"Seoul has a good subway system. It does what a subway is intended to do: it gets you where you are going. For the eight days that I visited Seoul I had frequent occasion to use this transportation service. If you look at the subway map, you will see how it crisscrosses the city, with the various crisscrossing lines. This means with a transfer or two you can go from any part of the city covered by the subway to any other part.The trains are quiet and clean. There are seats reserved for the elderly and the infirm, and seats reserved for pregnant women.Regretfully, there is at least one fly in the ointment, and that is the paucity of escalators at some stations. At those stations there is often a steep and long climb by stair."
Efficient and cheap!!,"This subway system is extensive and cheap. It took a couple of days to figure it out but once you do it's really easy to use and can get you anywhere you need to go, including the airport. The biggest obstacle is the sheer number of stations and lines available. Also, if you buy single trip cards, you must return them to an automated machine to get your deposit back each and every time. If I had to do it over again I'd just get the reloadable card. Avoid rush hours as the trains are also EXTREMELY full and personal space is non-existent as with a lot of other subway systems in Asia during peak hours."
Super easy,"Fantastic system. Get your t card and you can go anywhere. However, each station has multiple exits. Pay attention to which exit you need. It is all on google maps."
Easy to use,The Seoul Metro system was easy to use and is the best way to get around if you don't want to walk. You will need to buy a metro card from the ticket machine at the station which English is an available language. 
Tips on T-Money for new visitors to Seoul,"Some personal tips for new visitors:1. Buy a T-Money card for 3k won. Vending machines in metro stations offer options for 7k, 4k & 3k won. For 3k, you get one regular T-Money card. For 4k, u get a fancy looking card. For 7k, you get 2 fancy-looking cards. (Thankfully, i needed 2 cards this trip!!)2. I can confirm T-Money card saves U time, especially during rush hours. If u take a bus-metro combo trip, u could save a fair bit of money, provided u don't take too long for the transit. 3. Download KoreaTransit app to find the best routes from A to B, typically a combination of bus & metro. This app is not perfect but it's definitely one of the best public transportation app I've used so far. (In my view, better than a couple of Singapore apps I've used for Singapore.)4. One time, I could tap going in, but I couldn't tap out. Red signal came on & gate wouldn't open. No guard or attendant around to help me. Caused me a bit of panic, betore a local showed me to a nearby gate which opened without tapping out. To be sure I wouldn't get ""penalized"" i tapped the in-gate again but didnt go in. I found out next day from card balance i was charged for an ""additional"" trip. But its OK - ""peace of mind"" for me to know the card still works ok. 5. T-Money worked for me in Seoul & Gyeongju. Understand it will work in Busan where Im heading next. And yes, i can confirm u can recharge at most C-stores without any service fee."
Smooth and efficient,Smooth efficient fast and pocket friendly!!!If you want to travel around seoul metro is the way to go about! Super clean and quiet even when it is crowded.
"huge, clean, organized ","the subway is intuitive for those who have traveled by public transpo.go near a t.v. monitor above one of the doors so you can see the English translation walking between stations underground is ample shopping, convenience stores, bakeshops, subway street food, artworkimmaculately clean public toilets. new York city's bathrooms ate garbage dumps in comparison observe the bomb shelter preparedness.....and emergency kits"
So easy to use and plenty of signs in English to help ,Just get a prepaid ticket from most convenience stores and you are on your way. Can get tight in rush hour and stops at midnight.
Easy to use,"We found the metro very easy to use with all information in English. We bought T-money cards from a vending machine at Seoul station (4,000 Won) then there were top up machines at every station (cash only). Metro was clean, safe & very pleasant to use. Great to have well signposted toilets in every station too."
Metro,Easy enough to use but you will spend most your journeys on it standing up. There are also large staircases to get from ground level to station. 
Seoul metro is fantastic and huge,Easy fast transportation. Very recommended and not as crowded as the Tokyo Metro although at rush times it is the same
Great but Confusing,"It is really a comfort train, clean and tidy. But there is no english sign to read where we hv arrived and where will we going to stop. "
Clean and well maintained,"Connects various parts of the city very well. Cars are very clean and there are enough signs to show upcoming stations. Unlike Japan, you cannot hear the in car announcements clearly. Similarly, people are allowed to talk while traveling in the train. You should avoid peek hour traffic as people are in a hurry and expect to be pushed - they may not be polite as they are in a hurry"
Seoul Metro,Superb network of trains with 9 lines differentiated in 9 colour codes. The trains are very clean. Many passers by also helped in purchasing the ticket.
Clean and Clear,"I am really impressed that they announce each stop in four languages. The four languages are Korean, then English, then Chinese and finally Japanese. The reason I give it four stars is because at least at the stations I was at, there were NO elevators or escalators to go outside and I had to climb flights of stairs with my suitcase. Just be aware of this when you come and visit and you take the metro. You will have to climb up and walk down many stairs at some stations. "
Tourist-friendly,"Reviewing a metro/subway system is not normally my ""thing"" but it has to be said that Seoul's is excellent. Every box is ticked. Vast. Fast. Frequent. Clean. Cheap. Safe. Announcements and signage in English. You can use the metro as your weapon-of-choice to get around."
Top Metro.,One of the best ways to go around Seoul. It is covering the whole city and priced reasonably. It is also clean and modern.
A fantstic system,"Whenever you need to go more than a short distance from your hotel - take the Metro. So fast, cheap - and easy to use. Having said that, taxis are also quite cheap, but nothing beats the underground system for value."
Cheap and easy,"The cheapest and easiest way to transfer in Seoul and some other districts in Korea. But it's also very crowded during peak, of course!"
Seoul Metro is great!,"The metro is easy to use and easy to navigate, even if you don't speak Korean. Get the CityMapper app and the Korean Subway app before you go. The latter will show you where the entrances are and the former can guide you in any city. With those apps, it was a breeze. Truly, you don't need to know Korean to navigate this system. It is always on time, clean, safe and easy to use. Don't be scared! "
Easy to Use,"This is an easy to use option and best to use when there is heavy street traffic. Unfortunately, we were unable to get seats so had to stand up for 45’. It is a typical subway but is clean and orderly. "
Easy,"Well organised and easy to navigate, I downloaded an app, of the subway. We travelled all over Seoul."
Easy,We were impressed with how easy it was to use public transportation. Not only is it convenient but also clean and safe. We also found everything to be well marked.
The Only Way to Travel,The subway can be crowded and hot but its the fastest way to get around Seoul. Just know how many stops until you know to exit the train and you'll always get where you going!
Are Your a Tourist? Avoid Rush Hour. Excellent Mode of Transportation.,Don't get stuck in Seoul traffic. Use the Metro. Avoid using it during rush hour. Gets you almost anywhere in Seoul.Prices are extremely reasonable. Buy the plastic card and add funds as needed. Very convenient and fast.
Easy to use,"Seoul subway system is very simple to figure out I thought, you can get a ""T-Money Card"" and continue to reload it when ever you need. I am a frequent traveler to South Korea and have been using the same T-Money Card for 2 years, just reloading it whenever I visit."
Location of Airport Limousine Bus Stop,The bus stop is just across the street from the hotel making it very convenient! Busses to both Incheon and Gimpo share the same bus stop!
Easy ride from Seoul to Suwon,Metro was clean. Stops were announced and appeared in writing on a digital board. There was also a map of the route in the metro car. Took us about 45 minutes to go from Seoul to Suwon.
Efficient ,"We are a family from Hong Kong so we are familiar with metro stations. We didn’t have too much of a problem navigating, however at one point I did ask which direction to get on the train as most things are labeled in korean or with Korean names. But it’s definitely efficient and safe. Would recommend "
Why couldn't usa have such good public transportation,Seoul metro goes all over the metro area. Very inexpensive and reliable. A little confusing sometimes on transfers but english signs everywhere.
Easy to figure out ,"Use the Moovit app to make it easier. It’ll tell you the next station from yours, so you know which direction train to take. "
Metro is great!,"So easy from one place to others! Apps is supported, for you to more understanding. Also show the connecting with bus system!Very convincing!"
"Clean, fast and spacious ",The metro was really reliable and fast. Easy way to get around. Download the metro map onto your phone.
"Great quality, great network, a little deluding on timetables","Seoul metro line is one of the best ever, super clean, super efficent, always in time and well managed when there are big events and the stations get overcrowded.The only disappointing hing is that it often closes too soon, around 12 a.m most lines shut down and the start reoperating at 5.30."
View of metro,I am always considering the Metro a good way to visit a city. You can see the people and the quality of life of the city.Seoul Metro give me the same feeling.
Excellent transport system,"Stations , trains and platforms so clean and well maintained. So much space with platforms very wide. Trains very frequent with sliding doors to protect from the open tracks. Not ideal for disabled or with heavy luggage as not too many lifts around.Colour coded system and tap on/ off cards used which can be purchased and topped up."
The subway is an essential means of transportation for the movement of Seoul and its surrounding areas.,"The subway is very crowded during the rush hour. However, it is an essential means of transportation in many parts of Seoul and is also useful for traveling outside of Seoul.You can save money by bus and transfer."
"Be aware of Express vs. ""all stops""","The Metro in Seoul is world class. On time, clean, safe. Be aware, that Line 9 has an Express an ""all stops"" service. Board the wrong train you might travel forever. Or get past your station. There are several interconnection points, that are announced for these two trains. There you can change easily."
Metro trains,"Once you get used to the colours of the lines, very easy to use.. would put Naver maps on your phone as a bit more accurate than google maps. Make sure you buy a T Card as itll save you time and money trying to figure out the ticket.. You can get them from the airports CU, 7-11 just ask for 1 and how much you are putting on the card."
"Modern, clean and safe","And running on time !The map are not always in English but we always managed to find someone to help or some people came spontaneously to us in order to help (obviously we were showing we were struggling...)It is cheap, easy to access and for a first time in Seoul we managed pretty well.Congrats!"
Convenient and cheap,Travel around Seoul for just 1250W. Train frequency is like less than 5mins. Definitely a great way to travel around Seoul. Metro map has english indication. Some train lines provide english announcement for train arrival station but some don't. Just need to keep a look out.
Not too accessible for prams ,"The metro is comprehensive and covers lots of area but is not handicap or pram friendly, with not a lot of lifts."
Fast affordable and super clean,I would suggest downloading the map if you don't speak Korean but this is by far the best most affordable way to get around the city.
Take the Green Line and Circle Seoul,"You can go everywhere you want in Seoul on the green line - no 2 - which runs in a circle on the north and south sides of the Han river. It takes about 2 hours to complete the circle, or more accurately, the oval. All the main tourist attractions are accessible from the Green Line.Avoid the many cross lines - unless you are in a hurry and know what you are doing.Buy the Seoul MICE card which you can top at at machines at the stations, near the turnstiles. A single journey is 1,250 won - about US 80 cents. It's a bargain!The larger stations are set in large underground shopping malls selling clothes, shoes, coffee, rice cakes and much more. There can be up to 8 station entrances - the entrances are distinctive on the footpaths.The carriages are the cleanest I have seen in a subway system. And everyone is so polite: You queue for the doors to open. The carriages are crowded at peak hour and not at other times. Check the maps before you board to check you are going in the right direction. The maps and the signs inside the carriages and on the station are in both Korean and English, which make it a easy to navigate. Highly recommended."
Download their app before you go,If you download their app your stay in Seoul will be a lot better. It works without wifi. You can plan a route and it will tell you what trains to take and a map of the stations blinking. Some newer stations are bigger than some airports and some older stations are so small that the platforms are so small that if it wasn't because there are doors at the edge of the platform people would definitely fall on the tracks. It is like any other big city subway system but their signs are much better. Some signs on the street at the entrance will show where the train is so you don't have to rush downstairs. The exits are numbered so you never exit the station and find yourself in the middle of nowhere. If you are meeting people just tell them the station name and exit number. It is fast and convenient. There is a lot of underground walking if you are changing trains. The worst part is that Koreans like to walk with their eyes on their phones instead of ahead of them so be careful not to get run over by a Korean watching tv while walking. There are lots of stairs not too many escalators in the old stations.
"If you want to enjoy travel to Seoul Korea, must use Seoul Metro","As a citizen of Seoul, I would like to recommend to use this transportation for all to travel in Seoul. You can go anywhere via this.All metro lines built in the basement in Seoul.it looks like a world wide web, you can go anywhereYou can use this one very reasonable expense and very easy to transfer to other linesAnd some popular metro stations have their own cultural thingsJust bring one credit card. this is what you need to use transportation.Enjoy a travel to Seoul.서울 시민으로서, 저는 이 교통수단을 서울로 여행할 수 있도록 이용할 것을 권하고 싶습니다.이것을 통해 어디든지 갈 수 있습니다.모든 지하철 노선들이 서울의 지하실에 지어졌습니다.그것은 마치 월드 와이드 웹처럼 보이고, 당신은 어디든지 갈 수 있습니다.매우 합리적인 비용으로 다른 라인으로 쉽게 이전할 수 있습니다.그리고 몇몇 유명한 지하철역에는 그들만의 문화적인 것들이 있습니다.신용카드 하나만 가지고 오세요. 이것은 당신이 교통수단을 이용하기 위해 필요한 것입니다.서울 여행을 즐겨요."
Convenience way to travel,"everything great. never too crowded. but for the foreigner visitors there things to be considered :1. put announcement (digital) also in english2.some trains have the digital moving dot maps, but some doesn't (it is really important to make sure we don't miss the stops)3. always out of flyer maps in english in some places.Thank you for the convenience anyway..those things could make it perfect as in international standard"
Good transport ,"Bought a T card and relied on the metro and buses. The service is great! Fast, reliable, cheap and safe! Get a card and use this to get around!"
Easy & efficient way to move around the city,"The metro is the easiest & most efficient way to move around the city. Lines are clearly marked with colour code & numbers. Switching lines is easy, if sometimes a bit of a hike, but transfer lines are clearly marked.The T-money card is so easy to use & top up. "
Easy system to use with the app,Highly recommend downloading the Korea Subway app. It's very clear and easy to understand! We were able to navigate Seoul by ourselves thanks to the app.
clean and safe,"best Metro system I have seen. Clean, prompt, and safe. We traveled for 2 weeks around Seoul via Metro. Very easy to navigate"
Torture On My Legs,Never had i ever done as many steps climbing in my life as i had to when trying to get in and out a station. Sheer torture for my aging body.
Need an app and a T- money card,"With both above you will master the Seoul subway within one day. With a purchase of a T-money card we charged it with 30000 won (enough for 4 days full traffic). Follow in the app the station, a hub and a final stop (direction). In the station follow the transfer connection arrows. We reccommend the portable wifi, than follow the stations in the app (subway).."
"Very safe, clean , efficient","Amazing!!! Train stations from airport to Myeongdong actually have glass automatic doors between train tracks and platforms! Trains stop opposite doors which only open when train stopped. Trains comfortable very clean, fast, and frequent . Have large designated racks for luggage."
Clean and efficient. Bit crowded.,Hardest part was finding where and how to pay. You must have cash. The machines will let you buy one way tickets. We found them immediately next to the gates. Expected to find them before taking escalators down to the tracks like in other cities around the world.The machines automatically put a deposit on the ticket itself. Be sure to insert it into the refund machine immediately after existing your destination for a deposit refund.
Super subway,"very convenient, understandable! stations have not only names in two languages, stations have numbers - it’s very convenient!"
Metro Rides in Seoul,Traveller FriendlyClear signages in English at Stations and Platforms English maps in trains and on some lines real time display
Very well connected,"I have used metro in London, Singapore, Washington, and New york. Metro here is one of the bests I have seen. It was always on time and a great way to get around Seoul, especially if you are a tourist. One would be interested to notice how quiet the metro is in which people hardly talk. They are well-disciplined and follow the system very well. It was interesting to note the way people were glued to their smartphones. It is a good experience in Seoul."
Works better than DC and NY in USA,"The Seoul metro is awesome. There is a tiny bit of a learning curve with the color-coded lines but download the app and ride this clean, efficient, comfortable metro system as much as you want. Very cheap to use as well. A cute T-money card (which you can use in cabs, busses, even some markets) is just the cherry on top of an awesome metro system."
Complicated but yet is convienient,"The train system is complicated maybe due to language & not familiar with the places, but yet it very convenient to reach all the places we one, as long as u catch the right train :) "
Easy to navigate,"At first seemed complicated, but when you figure it out it is quite easy to use. The people around are also quite helpful. "
Cheap and efficient ,"At first I was a bit taken about by the Seoul metro. The route map was really extensive and each station has a number. But after a short while, getting to places in straight forward. Seoul Metro stations are HUGE. Some have areas that serve as shopping malls (largely for women). They seemed to have dug deep and far. You could be walking a fair distance to transfer from one line to another. The trains are comfortable and spacious (especially by London standards) and not as tightly packed like London or Hong Kong. But then again, the journeys aren't as stressful. Language wise, announcements are made in Korean, English, Manderin and Japanese. There is little pushing, Koreans are very polite and orderly. Again, unlike London and Hong Kong. There is usually a seat free, but it's custom to give to older people. This is often obused in Hong Kong, usually by youths and mainland tourists. But in Korea, its expected and there are seats at the end of the carriage that are specifically for old people and you're not allowed to sit on them unless there are no old people. Even then, most people will avoid them. There is little chatter and despite the amount of people, it's not noisy. Don't worry, the trains are long and cone at regular intervals. Safety is not really a concern, it seems most are law-abiding. The stations are clean (the aged ones don't seem it, but are) and some platforms have stalls selling food, drink or clothes. What's really considerate are the cupboards and racks that contain breathing apparatus and torches, in case of an emergency. That's really thoughtful. I can't see it bring done in London, due to budget or health & safety reasons. In Hong Kong, they'd be vandalised by youths or taken as souvenirs by mainland tourists. The Seoul metro isn't just a metro system, its pretty much a regional rail service in its own right. Just remember to get your T-money card. "
Get a map,Fantastic way to get around town. Metro is super clean and really connects you to every part of the city. A map is very helpful as there many lines going all over town
Clean and easy,We loved beating the traffic by using the subway.Maps were well posted and digital signage on the metro cars let you double check that you had the right stop. Do make sure you know which exit you need as there are many at most stops.Highly recommend.
"Clean, safe, and efficient","The Metro is an excellent way to get around Seoul. It's safe (as compared with New York City), quiet and smooth, and inexpensive. The only complaint is that difficult for foreigner to understand the Metro line from the outside. There are 9 lines, but the station signs show more of the Exit/Entrance number than the line - causing some confusions for the non-locals."
One of the best in the world,Packed but you could go pretty much anywhere in Seoul by metro. It is so efficient. Timing is super accurate. Helps that Koreans respect the 'elderly' and 'pregnant / women with children' seat assignments. Stops at strategic locations in town. Always lots of people but so reliable.
Easy to use and convenient ,It's very simple to follow so you can get to your destination quick. Signs also have English equivalent so its not that complicated. Cheaper than taking the taxi. 
Effective Rail Network,"The system was clean, covered most parts of Seoul and was relatively simple to use for a foreigner.It was very similar to the system in Japan both in terms of ease of use, cleanliness and getting around.The Korean Tour Card was simple to purchase and load although there were no credit card facilities and it was all cash, a negative."
Dirty...but it gets the job dobe,"If you’re used to SRT billet train then this is certainly a step into the slums, but it gets the job done. Easy to maneuver between stations, somewhat clean but usually very crowded, so be prepared to stand. "
Efficient ,As you might expect the train system in Korea is very efficient and easy to use. Its a color system so even non speakers like my self can get around using a metro map. 
Best transportation in the world,"I have been to Japan, Mexico city and many other big cities´ subways, but to be honest, Korea has the best subway system in the world!!!"
Metro ,"Amazing compared to any system in the worldThe metro is cheap and efficient, the only downside is that it stops running at midnight"
A bit confusing but with english translated signs and the best way of quick traveling,A bit confusing but with english translated signs and the best way of quick traveling .. A tip is to take photos of your start point as well as from your willing destination and you will survive..
Great way to travel,Cheap and reliable. The system is very clean and efficient. I would love to return and hope it gets better
Ma Annick,Efficient clean just to be jalouse of a great experience I love the music when the train is coming Only not enough elevator with yong children and a stroller
Travel the city like a local,Impressive network of trains serving Seoul. It can get confusing with so many rail lines (identified by colours and number) and sometimes transferring between stations is not so straight forward due to the names of the station and it takes a while to figure out which direction one should be going to when changing to a different line. One can take the train from Incheon Airport directly to the city - it is cheap and convenient.
"It's a really big network, but.....,","First of all the money card is a very good idea: just tap and go anywhere.Avoid rush hours : it can be very busy, if like myself you are no ""Spring Chicken"" don't hesitate to enforce your right to a priority seat! Young Seoulites don't like to give up their seats but will do so if they have to! If you have NAVER Map app. on your mobile it can be very useful when accessing or leaving Metro stations because. MANY of them have VERY limited escalator or lift access to street level, and lines are very deep resulting in long,long staircases ! NAVER will tell you where the escalators and lifts are! "
very neat subway system,"very easy as stations have info places, agents very glad to help you find way, cars very clean, speedy, several levels some escalators some lots of stairs rode it twice"
Clean and efficient way to get just about anywhere you wish,"I love the Seoul Metro system. It takes a bit of time to relate the various stations to the ground-level places one might want to visit; but after just a few days, it becomes almost second nature. It's also easy to purchase a multi-ride pass to which you can add funds as necessary. The stations have many markings on overhead signs as well as on the floor; and color coding also helps guide one in the right direction. In addition, there are several underground shopping areas that are convenient to the subway stations, making shopping a joy. As an added convenience, the stations have electronic monitoring to let you know how soon the next train will arrive at the station; and the punctuality of the trains is excellent. If you visit Seoul, before you rent a car, give the bus and subway systems a try. You may save not only money but also the stress of driving, allowing you to enjoy your stay much more."
Very efficient transportation system,"There are English signs, maps, ticket machines, and announcements. Trains are on time and took me wherever I wanted to go. There's an app to help you plan your route."
Great Service,"You an get anywhere on Seoul using the metro. Is fast, clean and very efficient. Is very easy to use, you can buy a travel metro card which gives you discounts, and you can find all the information and maps in English which is very helpful. "
"Fast, clean and convenient","Had to get from Gannam to Myeongdong during the rain. Couldn't get a taxi so bought a cheap metro ticket instead. Fast, easy and clean. "
Efficient and easy to use,The Seoul Metro is efficient and easy to us. The ticket kiosks have an English option and are not complicated. The trains and stations are clean. People are friendly and helpful if you need it. Signs are clear and readable. Using public transportation provides insights into local people living their lives. The Seoul Metro is great!
Efficient train system,"It's pretty easy to get from place to place on the train. Easy way of commute in Seoul. Just make sure one get onto the correct line depicted by different colors and numbers. Many of the stations do not have escalators up/ down so be prepared to walk up/ down long flights of stairs. Once out of the platform and at the scammers there are many signboards to show the directions, just have to pay close attention. There are numerous stations along the different lines and for example Myeongdong can be accessed via different lines.Good rides on the trains. "
Clean and easy,We used the Train system to make around Seoul. It was surprisingly easy even with so many different lines and not at all expensive. The trains were clean and no long waits between . Great way to make your way around Seoul.
Easy to use,"Clean, routes well identified, fast and relatively inexpensive to travel via Seoul metro. Does get crowded at times. We found evening hours busy. Still, there was always room to stand even if a seat wasn’t available."
Straightforward travel,Definitely the best way to travel around Seoul. Ticket buying is easy with ticket machines in english. The metro app has a good map.Remember that if you get a card ticket put the card into the deposit return machine at the end of your journey to get your 500 won refund.
Very easy to use,"It's totally worth getting a T-Money card; you can get them in a lot of places (including many hotels). You card in and out, and fares are fairly cheap. Important information is generally in Korean and English. This is a great way to get to and from ICN airport too. The trains and stations are clean and people seem to behave."
Buy the KOREA TOUR CARD (T Money),Trains run frequently and are clean. Very busy at rush-hour. Download the app to make travel easier as there are so many stations and the writing is so small on the paper route maps. The most important thing to remember is the exit number you need as the stations underground are vast.
Seoul metro experience ,"During my visit to seoul i have used the metro to move around recommend places for shopping , sightseeing and dining , i have to say it was above my expectations for its cleanliness and punctuality of timing. Easy straightforward of ticket purchases and following of stations maps and signs.Tickets are very reasonable price especially to avoid the road traffic compared to taxi."
easy metro in Seoul,"We stayed in Seoul for ten days and used the metro everyday, There are stations at all places in Seoul, even near the mountains. People are so helpful, but all u need is a map and u will get to see all the sites with ease. No issues at all. Just buy a one off charge card whcih is 5000kw. Then charge the card for 5000kw, once every few days, depending on your usage.. Its great, just tap in and out. the metro is very fast, clean and quiet. 5000kw is aprox £3.50. "
your anchor in this vast city,The subway (all bi-lingual) made it so easy to get around + find your way in a city where English is surprisingly uncommon.
Best way to get around Seoul ,"The metro is the best way to get around the city. For a low price you can go to all parts of the city including both airports. Seoul shares the system with the city of Inchon. So you can also get to most of Inchon as well. The blue line number 1 train also runs to uijonbu to the north and suwon city and pyongtek south of Seoul. The stations are safe and clean many of which have underground shopping centers. It's very easy to get around. Signs are all in Korean and English. Station and train announcements are in Korean, English, Japanese and Chinese. "
So clean,It is amazing to me that the subway stations and trains can be kept so pristine. It was such a pleasure to ride the trains and so convenient. We learned to stay quiet and to model our behavior after the locals. Definitely the easiest way to get around a big city. Have fun 
Organised and Easy to Navigate,"1. Single ride tickets - select a destination, pay the price and get a card. After the journey your card can be deposited into a machine and you receive 500 won back. We haven't had to queue to get tickets or deposit our cards - very civilized process.2. In general, easy to understand when you get used to place names. Unlike UK underground, it doesn't list the final destination of the train, it lists the next stop - so check which direction you're heading in.3. Trains are frequent and timely.4. We caught a train after a football match attended by 10s of thousand - nothing like a tube station after any match in London we've attended. Trains were frequent and the queue to board almost non-existent."
Convenient,The Seoul metro is very convenient. I purchased a card at a convenience store and had it loaded. I find the Seoul metro diagram fairly easy to read. Using the card is simple and can be easily reloaded from a vending type machine.
Convenient and efficient ,The metro card required 3000W deposit which is refundable. It is very easy to purchase or top up via the machine as it has instruction in various languages. The Seoul metro is a very complex networks that is very effective to travel. It will definitely help to download the subway Korea app. 
"Great Engineering, Remarkably Cultural, and Dirt Cheap","Normally I don’t review public transportation systems. They’re not something to see or do: they’re a means to get to something you want to see or do. The exceptions—the times when a public transportation system actually IS an attraction—are pretty obvious: San Francisco’s cable cars, Valparaiso’s ascensors, Taipei’s Maogong Gondola, Innsbruck’s Nordkettenbahnen, etc. Kiev’s Arsenalna Metro station is a bona fide attraction--biggest elevator in the world. But most public transport runs from boring to aggravating. Horse-drawn carriages, pulled rickshaws, the elephant rides at the Amber Palace, and the camel rides in Giza, are things to do, not public ways of getting around. But the Seoul subway system is not only an excellent public transport system, but one that adds flourishes of art and culture as well. Here I’ll just note one impressive engineering detail, one cultural artefact that any major museum in North America would give its eye-teeth to get; and a travellers’ tip.Engineering: Walk up to the tracks and no further. A platform-long, floor-to-ceiling transparent panel runs alongside the track. Its doors slide open only when a train has stopped, and those trains stop so accurately that the entire entrances to the cars, and not an inch more or less in either direction, are accessible. This of course prevents your being jostled off the platform, or accidentally falling onto the tracks just as the train roars into the station. A few months ago a fellow committed suicide by jumping in front of an arriving train in San Francisco’s BART system. Naturally all the commuters in that station at the time was horrified: this was REALLY going to delay them. In fact, the entire system shut down for an hour. Had the same fellow attempted the same suicide in Seoul, he’d have been out of luck, or maybe in luck, but still alive either way. In theory I suppose you could install a shield like that in existing subway systems like BART; but I suspect the tricky 21st century engineering bit isn’t the plastic wall: it’s the stopping of all trains at precisely the right spot on the rails. No system dependent on human drivers could do that.Culture: If you take time to look around when you’re at a Seoul station, you can see some remarkable things. At one station I was sitting on a curving multi-colour bench backed by an artsy wall and thin trunks of mature bamboo, with an old wooden beach chair and a Western-style toilet integrated into the seating for humour (Bench and Bamboo photo). Sitting there, I noticed a polished black objet d’art atop four mythical Korean lions in the middle of the pedestrian traffic, with four red-taped stanchions alerting folks to walk around it (Objet d’art photo). Every time a train came in, scores of folks would swarm out, making for the exits, without even glancing at whatever it was. I got up and found a tiny plaque stating that it was an ancient Korean sundial. And what an exquisite bronze sundial! Instead of just a flat dial, it has a central semi-sphere circled by a flat perimeter dial as well. I believe that the yellow-edged gnomon is a modern recreation. The astronomical engravings and calligraphy were in pristine condition, with just two or three tiny chips along the outer edge (Sundial photo). The most astonishing thing, other than it being in the middle of a Metro station walkway, was its casting date: 1435 C.E! That was during the reign of Sejeon the Great, who revolutionized Korea’s writing system, and sponsored the golden age of ancient Korean science. Jang Yeong-sil was a scientist who used an iron printing press decades before Johannes Gutenberg, and invented improved rain gauges, water gauges, water clocks, and a wide range of astronomical instruments, including sundials. Jang and his co-scientists created the “angbu-ilgu” (“pot-shaped sun clock staring at the sky”). There’s one at Gyeongbokgung, out in the sun, a fitter place for a sundial than down in a Metro station, but exactly the same as this one! To put the antiquity of this sundial into perspective: in 1435 the richest, most cultured, and most powerful state in Western Europe was the Grand Duchy of the West (stretching from Friesland and Flanders through Burgundy to the Alps, but long gone by 1500); the most powerful state in the Indian subcontinent was the Vijayanagara Empire (the first Mughals wouldn’t show up till the next century); the Eastern Roman emperor still reigned in Constantinople; the princes of Muscovy were still under the Tartar Yoke; the Incas were nomadic tribesmen who hadn’t even founded Cuzco yet; and Henry the Navigator’s captains were still struggling to get past the Western Sahara on the African coast. To put the location of this sundial into perspective: Can you imagine transferring at a Berlin U-Bahn station and seeing a 1455 Gutenberg Bible on display in the middle of the traffic flow as you head to the other line? Or spotting a 1434 Jan Van Eyck painting hanging on the wall at London’s Bond Street or Embankment station? They’ve actually got a 1434 Van Eyck in London, but it’s prominently displayed at the National Gallery, not down in a Tube station!And yes, I did discover cultural touches at several other stations, though not at all.Traveller’s Tip: Whether you’re landing in Incheon or Gimpo, the 5000-won “All Stations” ticket will get you and your luggage from the airport to whatever Metro station is nearest to your hotel: that’s less than 4 Euros, and slightly more than 4 US dollars."
Metro works. ,Not the easiest metro to navigate but with the help of Naver it is easier. You must get a T Money card for it work best. But after a few days got the hang of it all and worked perfectly
Easy to navigate,"Was easy to navigate, clean and very fast. It is quite cheap as well. It is cheaper than taking the bus if you have to take 2 buses. Advice: avoid rush hour because it gets very crowded se pic"
Metro is really easy use,"Don't be frightened of using the metro system. Google Maps does not work here, but Google maps does work with helping you know which bus and train/metro combination to use to reach your destination."
Plenty of info including in English,Extremely clean. No noise. Free clean toilets. Use t money cards 4000 won from CU shops or similar minimarket. To make sure charge 5000 won per day. The charging machines have English menu and they are everywhere in all stations. Accept banknotes and coins. CU and other similar minishops also charge these cards no commission.
Trains are clean and on-time. Families with young children on strollers will suffer,"Seoul Metro is one of the world's best. They're clean, offer great connectivity and on-time. I'm surprised that the fares are affordable and you can get to anywhere in Seoul quite conveniently. The bad thing which I remember most is that some subway stations are not stroller friendly. For example, Myeongdong station, there are 10 entrances to the subway but only 1 has elevator access. Even then it only brings you the concourse level and not entirely to the subway level causing you to carry your toddler out of the stroller and walk or carry the stroller with the toddler with it which is just pain and suffering."
A bit confusing,"I found this a difficult thing to manage by myself. It was hard to decide what stop I needed, how much that trip would cost and then also how to pay for my ticket. Fortunately many locals were willing to help me figure things out, the stations were neat and clean & the trains ran frequently. I’m glad that I experience this but when taxis are so reasonably priced and easy to locate, I only rode it once."
Super convenient ,Super convenient and very fast paced to get anywhere. All lines are connected so it makes it very easy to transfer between lines to get to any stop to almost any part of town 
"Fast, efficient and cheap transport","The way of getting around Seoul if you don't want to spend hundreds on taxis. Its fast, cheap and usually not overly crowed."
Excellent,"Went all over by metro with no issues at all. Was cheap and trouble free. Signs were in English, so it made it easier to navigate."
"Clean, Spacious, Efficient and With Air Conditioning!","We loved exploring Seoul on the Metro. Far more spacious than any North American subway or metro, and it was extremely clean and easy to navigated thanks to the plentitude of signage and English. Very simple to purchase single use tickets or the Korea Tour Card, and easy to top up and get your deposit refund back.And it has brilliant air conditioning!! It was so freaking hot in Seoul when we were there and unlike NYC or San Francisco, the Metro has AC and was an enjoyable and clean experience."
Very easy to use just requires cash,"Seems like as a foreign credit/debit card holder I could only get fare card with cash. Signage, maps, and stop callouts in English and logical flow. Easy and safe to navigate."
Cheap & efficient,Seoul has a very extensive metro network and is a very cheap and efficient way to get around the city. You can buy a T card and top it up at any station or you can buy single journey tickets. The T card saves 100KW per trip and is also useful on buses. Journeys in central Seoul are 1350KW and to the outskirts of the city only costs 1650KW. The trains run every few minutes and there are lots of interchanges between multiple lines. The trains are air conditioned and are a welcome relief to the heat of the city. Very safe and secure.
Pretty easy to navigate,Easy to navigate and a cheap way to travel but be aware that some trains don't stop at all stations. (Even downtown!)
Easy to use and navigate,"Clean, efficient and easy to navigate through. The seats are comfortable, the platforms well signaged. "
"Safe, clean, easy to use","Highly recommend using the Seoul metro to get around the city. Very easy to use with T-money card, that you can purchase at any convenience store. Stop are clearly marked to make it easy to know your stop."
clean & easy,"Clean, easy and effective...what else? There is not any trace of smell of urine. Unbelivable! It's very cheap, just 1 dollar for one ride."
They are always on time,The good thing about metro is they hardly get late. The metro is always on time and that's one of the praiseworthy issues. The stations are clean with the availability of basic amenities. 
Well planned and connected,"I love taking subways in foreign cities, and the Seoul subway is well connected and convenient. The stations could use some upgrading, but as a transportation option, the trains are fast, timely and a great way to travel around town."
Super effecient and fast,It was our main mode of transport throughout Seoul. Super convenient and reliable. Make sure you buy a t-money card from a convenience store so it makes it super easy and you get big discounts
Easy ,Seoul metro is a great transport - only thing is the multi-exits and at time confusing for first time tourist who could not use google map in South Korea for walking. Do remember to download the Naver Map or Seoul metro trip map to navigate around Seoul You can buy the tourist card for travelIn the booth and top up when you need - extremely convenient. 
Efficient,Great way to get around. Use the numbers on stations for reference as station names sometimes only in Korean. Be careful of express trains - they skip some stations. 
Easiest way to get around,"If you've been to Singapore then the Seoul metro is very similar. Ticket machines are easy to use and a single trip is roughly $2 AUD per person and you get a refund on the ticket at the end of the trip.We had a couple of problems with the machines, if you put coins in too fast the transaction will cancel and once we had a ticket that we could not refund.The announcements are in multiple languages and the trains are all air conditioned. Like Singapore there is no access to the lines so no accidents of falling onto the tracks or people running from one platform to the other.There are food stalls and markets at most stations.Not all levels have escalators so if you have luggage, sometimes it's a haul up stairs.The afternoon knock off is always busy, but with trains roughly every 2 minutes it's no big deal to wait for the next one.You'll find most Koreans are fairly rude when entering/exiting and it's not uncommon to see elderly people pushed out of the way. There is no real chivalry for seating either but then again this is the liberal age.Overall easy to use and a lot cheaper than a taxi."
Very convenient ,Visiting South Korea for work and stayed about an hour from Seoul. The public transport system was a great way to get around and relatively easy to understand. Convenient to move in and around the city and cheap fares. Make sure you get a T money card to tap on/off.
"Everything is clear, convenient, comfortable, fast, inexpensive!","I was guided by the map, the scoreboard in the wagons and the application Explore Seoul. I have never lost my way! When transferring to the bus within half an hour after the trip by subway, payment for the bus is not charged. Many stations have tourist information. Everywhere clean toilets are free."
Efficient and air conditioned,Used it only for short trips but the service is prompt and the cars spacious and air conditioned. Station announcements are in Korean and English.
Great Seoul' Metro,"Seoul's subways are the best in the world. It's safe, fast and clean. Although the route may seem a little complicated when first used, it quickly becomes familiar if you can see the map and choose your destination. If you have any difficulties, please don't hesitate to go to the information office and ask questions and you will be very kind to help. And it is more convenient to use the card than to use cash, and the deposit of the card is refunded. Using the Metro from Seoul is one of the best ways to enjoy the city.One caveat is for the elderly and pregnant, and it is Korean manners not to sit down even if the seats are available.서울의 지하철은 세계 최고수준입니다. 깨끗하고 빠르며 안전하고요. 목적지만 선택할 수 있다면 지도를 보고 쉽게 이용이 가능합니다만, 노선이 많아 어려움을 느낀다면 인포메이션 창구로 가서 도움을 요청할 수 있습니다. 그러면 매우 친절하게 알려줍니다. 현금보다는 카드 이용을 권하고, 이용권은 반납하면 보증금을 돌려받을 수 있습니다. 유의사항 한가지는 노약자석이나 임산부 전용석이 있는데, 자리가 비었더라도 앉지 않는게 한국의 매너이다."
A very efficient metro system,I used the modern metro system in Seoul for about a week in during an International Conference. It was highly time accurate and reliable. The metro was much convenient to use than a taxi cab. I also used the metro between Incheon Airport and downtown Seoul. This is possibly one of the best metro systems in the world.
The easiest way to get around Seoul,"With only USD1(starting rate, depends on the distance) you can get almost all the attractions and places in and around Seoul by this metro. Very clean, easy to reach and transfer. Remember when you get in out at the gate, touch the metro card on your right hand and push the gate bar on the left hand."
All you need is the Naver app... it like Korea's version of google maps,"It's my third time in South Korea, it's my son's first time. During my time, I printed a map. For my son's time, all you needed was an app. It's very easy to go around South Korea if you had a wifi connection and a naver app. It shows the fastest way to reach your destination and what train to take. It also tells you which way had the shortest walking and transfer of trains. I just love the transport system in Korea. It's easy and fast. I wish they had an unlimited transport card for tourists like us. But the trains were clean, safe and people were very polite, it was so quiet in the train . Visit South Korea friends, going around the tourist spots was easy through the Seoul metro."
so clean!!!,"I have been all around the word and rode in many transit systems. The Korean Metro system has got to be one of the best ones in the world (IMHO). Easy to navigate, clean, and friendly English speaking staff eager to help."
Seoul Metro,"very good punctual service, it does get busy at peak hours, I actually like to use it at quieter times of the day when it is easier to get a seat, the carriages are kept clean and I would recommend it"
Best way to get around the city.,"We took the metro everywhere during our stay and it was great. My husband, meanwhile, took taxis and constantly got stuck in traffic (as did we, using the bus to get to the airport). Whenever possible, take the train."
Very clean and efficient.,"While not as good as the Tokyo Metro, in my opinion, the Seoul Metro is still one of the best in the world and depending on the day, I'd put it at number 2 or 3. Very clean, very fast and very efficient. Cost effective as well. One downside is that the people who ride it are not as quiet and reserved as in Japan and you will hear lots of people on their mobiles or being loud."
Easy to Use,You can find everything you need in English to get around. Taxis in Seoul are difficult to hail as there are restriction as to where they can stop so you really have to find a taxi stand and taxi drivers English can be limited. Buses are an adventure if you don't have a Korean speaking guide but they are cheep. So all in all the subway was my prefered method of getting around.
An excellent means of transport for visitors to Seoul,"A great way to get around Seoul. Punctual, perfectly described stations, clear signs to find the way."
Great option to move,"Just on time and a lot of lines. Great option to meet the city. Use KakaoMetro as app to move, plan your trip and know how much is the ticket."
Good,"Directions and stations have english letters so easy to follow, not so crowded and got enough space for the elderly."
Very practical ,Look very good to your direction.So if you stand ready to get in the train.Look you will see above you were you are. A arrow will point were you are going....check on you map. It is not always clear if you go down to your train.The subway is endless.... and very practical. And extremely safe even at night as a women on your own..... I did...Nothing to worry about!
Remains an excellent metro network,"Seoul's Metro has risen from nothing 50 years go and overall is a great rail network.Station numbering plus bi-lingual signage in Korean and English help one to navigate.A few station interchanges can be confusing to first time users, particularly the larger ones.The Seoul station transfer to AREX is cumbersome but it remains a better option than the airport bus or driving, because the latter two are subject to traffic congestion.Metro trains are frequent, fast between stations safe and extremely clean. Users tend to be courteous, far more so than in mainland China.The T Money card strangely can only be topped up in cash, but can be purchased using a credit card. It can be used in Seoul, Busan and other cities, a feature not available with similar public transport smartcards in Australia.There were very few Seoul Metro staff visible. Platform screen doors minimise injuries though.I did not see any inoperable escalators or lifts.It would be better if which entrances and exits had lifts were more clearly indicated as this would help visitors travelling with luggage as we were, not to mention the elderly, mums with prams, disabled and those with lots of shopping bags."
Good way to get around ,The metro is a good way to hop around the city and transit to buses. Just get the transportation card (t-money) from any convenient stores.
Nice,The Seoul metro is very convenient. I wish the stops were illuminated on a board inside the train like Shanghai metros.
Easy To use and Get Around,"We enjoyed taking the train around Seoul. Pretty easy after you figure things out. Remember to press English before you start buying your train pass. However, didn't need to press English anymore since its about 3 steps to reload your card."
Great,Always on time and frequent trains. Easy to navigate but I do wish they would put more subway maps at stations. 
Nice interesting place ,A nice interesting place to connect trains as well as do some shopping and have quick meals. Certain airlines you can check in your flight from here
Easy to navigate ,Easy to navigate. Even easier if you download one of many Korean metro/subway map apps. The metro is also clean and has good seating.
The only way to travel!!,"Can’t recommend this highly enough; very easy to use, inexpensive and if you can get the recharge pass - very convenient for travel across the city."
Easy to use,"It is one of the best metro systems I ride. Quite punctual with English announcements. Nobody is drinking or eating at the metro and nobody make ling calls it is not acceptable by others,"
Works great. Now some tips....,"Get the Travel card if u intend on covering longer distances. Works out cheaper and u can get a refund of the balance.Available any convenience store which are scattered everywhere in SeoulTravel card is a tap and go system at the gates. When buying at the convenience store you can charge it with fundsFor the train system. Get a printed map. Follow the coloured lines and most importantly PAY ATTENTION to the NUMBERING SYSTEM.Each station has a number eg 234, 235, 236. Makes it very easy to know which direction and where u are.Station numbers are visible on the doors of the train before u enter or leave."
Safe fast and easy access,I have travelled around the world and find the Seoul metro very user friendly. Not knowing any Korean I can still find my way around the city easily.
Ok,"Only made two short trips, one direction the cars were really packed with standing room only. Some difficulty for people with handicap that long standing ride would cause stress. Overall this was a positive experience."
easy to use,"Very convenient and expansive metro system. Easy to use, also for foreigners as announcements are also in English. Even the displays on board of the subway trains have English text. The fare is rather low compared to other capitals I have been to.A great way to get around in the city!"
Easy ,"I have a really bad sense of direction, but the Seoul metro made it quite easy to get around. Available in 4 languages, workers also help people with friendliness. "
super easy,Lines are color coded and numbered. Monitors show where the train is between stops so you know how long to the next one. All stops on a line are numbered. Announcements are made in Korean and in English. You can buy tickets at the machines in English as well. Super easy!
Clean and in time,The metro are clean and safe. At the rush hour the trains are very full. Especially Line 2 (green line)
Great way to get around Seoul,We are a retired couple from Australia.We had 6 days in SeoulOur accommodation was a short walk from Seoul Station.It was a short walk through the Station to the Subway.When buying tickets for our first trip we greatly appreciated help offered by volunteer staff.The Trains are clean and like most large cities can be crowded at peak time.They are frequent and not expensive.A great way to avoid lengthy traffic delays !
Seoul Metro,"Don't hesitate to use Seoul Metro! Signs in English. Super easy and economical. Clean stations and trains, restrooms available at almost every station were clean and stocked. Great experience."
Best Transportation,The idea way to travel around Seoul. Use various apps to assist as it can be a little confusing in the beginning. Google Map isn’t supported in Seoul so we had to resort to other apps to help us. Such an incredibly clean metro system. Extremely safe and on time. Best way for travel around the city! Buy cards from a 7-Eleven and you can get a refund on the balance remaining at the airport before you leave the country!
Impressive !,"Easy to manoeuvre around,You can buy Metro tickets at the stations or in a 7/11. Charge them with money when you buy them, most journeys cost about 1,250 Won which isn’t more than £1, children are charged less. Just swipe them as you go in the station, swipe as you leave the station. There is a machine in the station if you want the unused money returned, or just leave on the card for your next journey. Metro maps are clear and easy to navigate around. I personally love the different little tunes the station plays when a new train arrives. Very clean and feels safe. No problems. We bought cartoon character cards just for fun but standard cards cost less. Ask for metro cards, choose your card and off you go!! Enjoy x "
Easy but tiring,The metro is easy to use and the map is easy to read . However there are a lot of stairs and its tooo tiring to go up and down without escalators 
An efficient subway system,"First the system covers extensive area. Signage & instructions are very clear in four languages ie Korean, Chinese, English & Japanese. Even the in carriage announcement are in four languages.Second, it is a very reasonable price and I would say that it is very cheap with the level of service. Clean and allow drinks in train but Korean locals are very considerate and no rubbish at all. Pregnant woman not matter how earlier in their pregnancy will have designated seats available in each carriage. Constant announcements to remind passengers in 4 languages. Some transfer stations are large and you may have to walk a few minutes so you need to watch for the closest transfer and pick the most convenient transfer line . It is the first time for us to visit Seoul and it only cost us 4200 Korean won to travel 55Kms from airport to the city central. ."
Best way to get around Seoul,"Awesome metro. 9 different lines criss-crossing the city. There is nothing you can't get to by using the metro. Purchasing a single use ticket is easy - there is an English option adlnd you can simply select your destination. Fares are cheap, and you pay a 500 won deposit on the card which can be easily refunded at your destinatation. Make sure to have some 1000 won notes because some ticket machines didn't accept any notes with a higher denomination. Make sure you know both your line (color and number) and the end of the line for the direction you are heading (to be sure you get on the right direction train). There are displays and announcements on the train (Korean and English) so you won't miss your stop. Transfers are relatively easy, with plenty of English signage. Each station has neighborhood maps so you can work out the best place to exit. No need for timetables - next train is never more than a few minutes away. Compares favourably metros in HK, Japan and Singapore as one of the best networks in Asia. If only Melbourne had one ☹"
Really easy to navigate and the best way to get around Seoul,We got T money cards from a convenience store (you can use them for purchases at convenience stores and to pay taxis in addition to using them for mass transit). Download a Seoul subway map app on your phone!
"Easy and convenient, but avoid rush hours ","I’ve been traveled many places and Seoul metro is one of the best metro system in the world. It is convenient and has 4 languages services: Korean, English, Japanese and Chinese. Each lines has their own color and you can follow the color if you want to transfer to other lines. One thing you have to keep in your mind as a tourist, DO NOT Use it during the rush hours. You will see pure hell. Line 1: super old and can be confusing. Line 1 goes to either Incheon or Cheonan and you need to be careful when you get on. You can use this line for Seoul station. Line 2: circle around Seoul. It goes all most every shopping attractions - Hongdae, Gangnam, Myeongdong, etc Like 9: don’t use it during rush hour. You will be suffocated by people. Especially express line 9 is hell. "
"Simple to use, signs in multiple languages, safe and clean","The Seoul metro is easy to use, good value, safe and very clean. It also allows you to avoid the famous traffic on the roads to get to place easier and faster.Multiple connecting networks get you to all parts of Seoul including to Incheon and Gimpo airports and transferring between lines is easy with well marked signsNot just for the budget conscious, it is a convenient way to travel in Seoul"
Only way to travel,"Seoul metro makes getting around the city so easy, as does the frequency of the trains as they go every couple of minutes. It is very easy to navigate and a fast cheap way to get around.Some of the metro shops are actually like underground towns there are so many shops and stalls etcWould definitely recommend this as the best way to travel in Seoul "
"Fast, Convenient and inexpensive way to move around Seoul",Seoul subway system is a dense networked subway system. It's easy to use and inexpensive means to travel across the city.
Efficiently Getting around Seoul,All you need is a t-money card and Naver maps app in your phone. So easy to get around.The exits are numbered but it really helps to know where you're going before you hop on.
Metro system is very convenient,It is always clean and easy to aceess many of places. Many of lines make you complicate but once you notice thire system you might understand how convenient it is.
Busy but fastest way to get around,"Used the metro in rush hour. Although busy it was still the fastest way to get around the city, cab would have taken over an hour in traffic. The metro was clean and had aircon, also very easy to use. "
Excellent way to travel around Seoul,"Great and well-connected metro...easy to use by any traveller. Clean, reliable, and efficient, highly reccomended"
Business and family visits,"the train goes directly to the main terminal in downtown Seoul,,from there you can access the metro all over Seoul or if you have the inclination,,you can actually walk from train terminal ,cross the walkway over the main traffic streets to the Hilton,,Shin Shin Hotel in about 20 to 30 minutes.. Comfortable, ample seating, big windows to gaze out,,very well manged clean train,,great way to see the countryside as you pull into Seoul. I went to high school on the military base so its amazing to see how cosmopolitan Seoul has become"
Easy way to get around Seoul ,The Seoul metro is one of the best ways to get around Seoul. Prices are cheap and trains run frequently and are clean!! 
Good cheap way to travel,You can travel with min of 1320 won . Single or multiple travel cards are available. T MONEY cards are easily available
Easy service,It's easy to understand. But the first time i.ve lost cause i didnt understand well the system. Once you get the system it will be easy
Great To Go Around - 很方便的地鐵系統,We enjoy a lot with the system. We can go everywhere we are about to go by the system and it is very English friendly & easy to understand. The fare is reasonable & its underground walk gives another plus. It has a lot of trains & starts early and last train is always late. 這個系統很便捷，我們想去的地方都可以用這個系統過去，英文友善而且容易瞭解，價錢合理而且很多地下通道可以遮陽擋雨變成大加分，車子很多而且開始早又結束晚。
"Clean, modern and reliable",Such a good service - just load up your T-money card and away you go.So clean and reliable. Easy to work out the lines to be on too.
Cheap and fast public transportation,"Foreigners? First timers? No worries. English, Japanese and Chinese announcements are made every minute in the subway. Even directions are written in different languages. Their system is very helpful and the fare is cheap. You can go anywhere with the subway. You don’t have to worry about traffic. It comes on time."
Dummy proof ,Everything is color coded. Super easy to navigate. Subway Korea and KakaoMetro are great apps the navigate system. 
Quite confusing ,"Don't get it wrong, it is a great service that connects the whole city, but it is awfully confusing, lots of lines, signs are confusing as well as the lack of directions. It is better to use Google maps because you might get lost and annoyed if only you use the sign in the stations. Tho confusing, it is neat and polite. Pretty safe I must add. Good option but not to be used a lot if you're staying for short periods of time. "
Very effective,"We did not take the T money card, It costs 2500 KRWs and in non refundable. We took about 10 rides @ 1350KRW per ride. they ask you for 500 KRW deposit which is paid back when you end the ride at the machine, like 30 seconds more it takes to get back money.Clean metros, 90% folks on the train on smart phones :) welcome to Samsung Land."
Excelent structure ,With a map on your hands you just go everywhere!!! Only negative point is most of stations has a lot of stairs! No escalator.
"Punctual, clean and value for money","Is easy to purchase train ticket at the station, if you miss the train, don't worry the train s are very frequent. They are very clean and announment are made at each stop in Korean, Chinese and English. They are also screen in each carriage to show the next stop that is coming . Is easy to get from a to b without too much problem. The staff at the train station speaks english and are very helpful."
Very good public transport,"One of the best public transport system in the world. Not joking. Super easy to find, to transfer, everything’s written in English. Love it. Download kakao metro app, it will save you the hassle. "
Great service ,We travelled by metro on our 10 day trip to Seoul. Great service. Eveywhere was clean and tidy. Every member of staff was helpful. We used T money cards which made for very cheap travel. 
Transportation in Seoul,"Transportation in Seoul was superb. We stayed at Namyeong area and and it was so convenient for us using the subway although with 3 young children ages 4 & 5, two (2) infants 1 yr 10 months old. The only thing we need to study and understand the colour and and the line number of the subway map for us to move around.From Namyeong, we went to places like Myeongdong, Dongdaemun, Namdaemon, Itaewon, etc. all by subway"
"Clean, efficient . . . but",". . . what I wouldn't do for a few more escalators, especially when trying to get to Seoul Station and the Airport Express Train."
faster way in getting around Seoul,I love the Seoul Metro! It made getting around Seoul so easy as a breeze. This mode of transportation is so efficient for travelers who want to make most of their time since it gets you to your destination faster.
Fast efficient,"An extensive network that takes you to all parts of Seoul. It's a cheap and efficient way to get around town. The single journey tickets have a 500 Won deposit, redeemable at your destination. It encourages recycling but is time-consuming when you are in a rush."
Very convenient,"Cheap transportation that will bring you anywhere. inexpensive, easy to understand. Buy a T-money card, it's cheaper and saves you time."
Extensive Network,Seoul Subway is one of the most convenient ways to travel in the city. The network is very extensive. There should be more signages in English.
"It is a convenient, clean and cheap way to travel","I used the metro quite often as it is cheap, very clean and frequent. There are signs in Korean and English and announcements telling you the name of the next station and is easy to use."
you can go anywhere with Metro in Seoul ,"I even worry when earthquake occurs, the whole Seoul city would be sink to the ground. even you can go near cities by metro."
Perfect,"I love metro in seoul. Fast and easy. You can go whenever you want, air conditioner inside, easy to buy card."
Easy and affordable,The system is well organized and bilingual. It works with colors with each route having it's own color. Trains are modern and clean. Sub terraenean stations are packed with shops and the Gangnam station is a city in itself. It is also cheap. Within Seoul a ticket will run 0.5$ to 3.00$ and going an hour south about 4.00$
First Rate,Seoul Metro is hands down one of the best in the world. Organized and always on time. Clean and easy to navigate. For older or infirmed commuters might not that great due some of the stations have great stairs to climb. Elevators are not available at all times. Be informed. 
Convenient and efficient,"Buy a card because you will be using this mode of transportation every day and it is worth your time to be prepared instead of buying a ticket every time you go somewhere. It is clean, safe and relatively easy to figure out. I wish we had this mode of transportation in the USA where I live."
Very easy to navigate,"Ticket machines, stops and lines all written in English. Trains have air con and are very roomy. The Koreans are VERY civilised and line up in single file to get on. "
Efficient,"Goes very often , much easier than metro in Tokyo , wonderful maps and people kindly assist to help if needed"
Efficient,The subway in Seoul is clean and efficient. It is easy to navigate and you can get to all areas of the city by switching from 1 line to another. It costs approximately $1.25 per trip per person. It may be a bit difficult for a non Korean person although there are words in English and if you know what station you are headed to it gets pretty simple. There are also many food stands and shops inside various stations across the city. It can get very crowded during rush hour but just shove your way on and you will be fine. No use being dainty and reserved. People don’t take offense to being bumped into as it is part of the culture. 
Convenient and efficient,"I always rely on subway to travel when overseas. Seoul subway is efficient, clean and modern. Highly recommend to get a T money card, which can also be used in buses. Glad to know the T money card has no expiry date. Each subway trip costs 1,250 won. There is rebate if one transfers between subway & bus."
Reliable transport,Extensive network makes exploring Seoul convenient on the Seoul Metro. Ticket machines are in English. Takes cash only. No credit cards. Stations and trains are clean and well maintained. Lots of underground shops within the stations. Remember to collect your 500 Won refund after using your ticket.
very easy to get around,make sure you buy the card and charge it with money. if you are going to other cities after you can use it there as well. 
"Efficient, convenient and quiet",Rode metro in both Busan and Seoul. Trains inpending arrival is alerted by a rousing marching anthem... perhaps to wake up sleeping passengers who may miss the train. By quiet I especially note Koreans are very polite not talking loudly or blaring music in the metro.
Good train,We have nice time to raid the train and easy to know the next stop the train was clean and good arrange
Efficient!,Looking at the whole subway map is quite confusing. I literally got lost after alighting the express train from the airport. It took a while for me to be familiar with the exits and transfer but after that taking the seoul metro was a breeze. Try to download the subway app to help you navigate the lines.
easy to use,"Clean, easy to navigate and fast too. You can use just this mode of transportation to get to any place in Seoul. Avoid old people when walking though, some may bump into you on purpose."
Should try harder,"We often choose a hotel with access to a metro station and in this case the National Assembly. The many routes/lines never seem to go where we needed to be and this meant transfers several times. We are used to Tokyo metro and it has more cars more often and travel times are much quicker. At times, we found the bus service to be better than the subway."
Just okay as out dated,"Using Metro at Seoul is convenient as most tourist attractions can be reached including DMZ . As Korea is not a highly populated country, Seoul Metro is not busy at all even at rush hours. This is really the best for Tourists in comparing to Tokyo, Hong Kong, Shanghai, NYC etc. We spent three days with Seoul Metro, our experience is pleasant.The Seoul subway network is just similar to any others in the world and therefore easy to use if you are acquainted with the principles of Subway System. Seoul Metro needs extra effort to update their hardwares. Some trains use PA, some trains use signs for station to station reminder and which side of door to exit. No electronic Lines/Stations indicators in the cars. Seoul supposed to be a modern city and the trains shud be more user friendly with more equipped.Also, Station Escalators are insufficient and all stations are not Disable Friendly. Worst of all, is the ticket deposit and refund system. 500 Won is the deposit for each ticket and needed to get refund before leaving the station The Deposit for Tmoney (fare storage card) is 4000Won but is not refundable. For tourists, you have to buy and refund in every Metro trip including the Train from Incheon Airport.Luckily, Seoul is not a busy city and the refund machines are not busy as well otherwise is really a waste of time."
Fantastic ,"Fantastic, clean and on time metro system. No problem not knowing Korean, everything in English. Very easy to navigate Seoul...Excellent metro..."
Excellent,"The Seoul subway is a cheap, fast, and easy way to travel around Seoul. The stations are clean and feel safe (we are two women). The hardest part for us was finding the subway stations we wanted. When you buy your ticket, you pay a 500 won deposit and when you exit, you quickly stick your card in a refund machine and a 500 won coin pops out. Very efficient!"
Convenient and covers the whole city,"If you take time to learn the payment system and how to read the station maps, you are all set for a great time traveling in Seoul. Some trains and station are a bit older but still efficient."
Holiday ,The metro is easy to use and the routes are colour coded. The trains are very well air conditioned and the stations are announced in languages including English. If you can read a map getting around is simple. Transit cards are available at all stations and you can recharge at places like 7/11. A very good service. 
Great Metro system ,Traffic is generally terrible in Seoul so the Metro a relatively cheap and easy way to get around covering most of the city. You can buy single trip tickets which you can reload and when you are finished with them you can redeem your card deposit 1500Won (about £1). The trains are very clean and fellow passengers very courteous. Be careful not to sit in the seats reserved for pregnant travellers (marked in pink) or the seats reserved for elderly travellers...you will get disapproving looks. 
Seoul Metro,"When I arrived at the Incheon (ICN) Airport, I bought a T-Money Card and loaded it with Korean Won. Used the AREX train to go to Seoul (and back to ICN). And used the subway trains within Seoul. Just tap-on and tap-off when using the Seoul Metro. Easy. "
One of the best in the world,"The Seoul Metro is so easy to ride, understand, and use. My best advice is to download Naver Maps (there is an English version) which will tell you exactly where you need to go, which platforms and even which direction. And most of all it is INCREDIBLY affordable."
Very easy and clean,"We walked from our hotel to Myeongdong Station and purchased a card/ticket (they do not have paper tickets) for Dongdaemun History & Culture Park to access the DDP and Cheonggyecheon Stream. Subway is very fast, easy, clean, and pleasant. After departing the station, you have the option to return your plastic ticket in a machine for a 500-won refund. Or you can keep it as a souvenir."
Seoul Metro,"The metro is great. It's very inexpensive, clean, goes most everywhere and the stops are announced in English."
Nothing special,We used the metro on a few lines. We got a t-card from one of the machines which was good. We went mainly from Seoul station. It was just your average metro really. The carriages were amazingly air conditioned which is what we wanted one day when it was super hot. It is easy to use and was clean.
Lebaran Holiday to Seoul and Busan,"Really nice having Lebaran Holiday to Seoul and Busan With Fam Brother n Wife Sister and 3 Nephews. This is my first to Korea while my fam bros and sis, they are the second time. Hereare my reviews and my experiences while I was there on 07 - 13 June 2019."
"Easy, convenient and inexpensive","I cannot read Hangul, but I have found traveling all around Seoul by metro to be very easy experience, especially if you download KakaoMetro app to your phone. It is available in English, and will easily allow you to plan your trip (gives you exact times of trains, too)."
Impressive,Very organised and toilets are super clean! Has a large underground shopping centre and thats where u can find Lotte mart and departmental store too
Convenient way to travel within Seoul,"Get a T money card, which is a stored value card, before you travel on the Seoul subway. The T money card will save you on fares and time (versus buying a single trip ticket).The Seoul transit system is easy to use. Do take note of the Line number, colour of the Line and the name of the end station to the direction you are heading to.The train cars are quite clean and there are announcements in Korean and English on the next station it is calling at.I’d noticed that there are not many escalators in the stations so if you are carrying heavy bags do consider whether you wish to use other mode of transport."
It is Everywhere in the City,It is the cheapest way to move around the city and it is everywhere. Make sure your hotel is close to one of the station in Seoul. Just comparable to what Tokyo.
Impressed! Super clean and organized!,"The trains are super clean! Koreans take pride in taking care of their public facility. The signs are available in English,it is clear and easy to read/understand. The rate is very affordable. Throughout my stay in Seoul for 3 days, never had any train delays. During peak, people do not rush to get in. Nearly all of the passengers queue to get in and out. Impressed with the metro service and would recommend to all. Some of the stations may not be disable friendly as I notice they were no escalators for certain exits or lift, but then again I might be wrong. You might want to check prior to traveling. Family friendly. Abundant seats for elderly and pregnant ladies. Thumbs up for that. For trains from Airports, there are certain part of the trains where you can place your luggage bags which makes it more convenient."
"So organized, so easy to take",Just press on starting station and end station on board and you will be given price. Slide money in and get change back. The cars are so nice and the stations do well maintained. 
If you think the trains in HK and SG are impressive...,"For one thing I can say about the trains in Korea: they are extremely efficient. You can practically go around their country via train be it in a subway or above ground. Point A to point B was never this efficient! In all fairness, Korea has more land area than SG or HK but still, the massive railway network is quite overwhelming! It may take a while for you to get used to where to get on and get off, but for one thing that I was most impressed of is how they treat passengers with very young children. Even old people on the train would give up their seats and insist that you take it so your little child can sit down. (Very friendly people!) If there is one thing I noticed about the Korean people, is that they are friendly and accommodating to tourists, even if they are not that fluent in English."
Clean and regular,Good system - I have travelled on a lit of underground systems in the world and this measures up. Though I did manage to get on wrong train once. Trains are clean and run regularly. 
Efficient system,"A good way to get around town. The trumpet fanfare that plays when the train is pulling up is hilarious. If you buy a single ticket you must turn it in at the end of the ride. If you are taking it a lot, then buying a multi-pass is a good idea but there's a non-refundable deposit."
Nice metro Service,"Although it could improve more in some spots such as the screens and the arrival calls, the metro service is very convenient for a person visiting Seoul for the first time."
Great experience,"Unique experience with Train, It is cheaper than using taxi but you have to get used to walk up and down stairs. Dont forget to take 500 won deposit back after single ride. There are some stores in this underground station, you can try Gangnam Station to shop around and Jamsil Station."
Inexpensive and Fast,"The metro is well connected and the cheapest way to commute. Also, it is the fastest. The metro map is easy to understand "
Convenient Train Ride,The Seoul Metro is both convenient and comfortable.Trains are on time and passengers board the train in an orderly manner ; hardly any pushing.Trains are clean and the seats are spacious.Metro tickets are reasonably priced around US$1 per trip.Download the Metro app whereby you key in your destination and departure station and you will be shown the train/s to take and the estimated travel time.Trains are fast travelling at a cruising speed of about 100 km/hr.
Excellent!,"The metro service is efficient and easy to use. We bought the Tmoney card and it can be reloaded at all stations. It cost 1250 won per trip for adults and 720 won per trip for teens. For teens, you need to register at the point of purchase to get the discount. Koreans are helpful. My daughter was unable to exit one of the stations and a Korean helped her. Do take note that there is a lot of walking and climbing of stairs, especially if you need to change lines. You also need to figure out the next station to determine the direction you are heading to. The metro can get a little crowded during peak hours but there are enough trains to cater for the crowd. All in all, the metro is highly recommended."
Great Service,Very easy to navigate the metro. Ease of use and convenient. connects almost every part of seoul and beyond. 
exceptional,on-time and so affordable buy a T money card at the airport on arrival (and probably other places in the city) and just make your life so easy
Very good.,"Very good and cheap transportation.We can reach almost all travel spot with this. And if you use it together with the Subway Application of Seoul, they are fantastic."
Very Efficient,I was amazed how clean the Metro cars and facilities were. The Metro service is very efficient and orderly.It was a bit difficult trying to figure out where to go because there’s not too much signage in English but staff are very friendly and helpful.It gets crowded because a lot of people use the Metro which is a testament to how useful and well run it is. I’m not one for large crowds and tight spaces so if you’re claustrophobic may want to reconsider using the metro.
"Clean, safe, fast, cheap.","The moment we arrived in Seoul we each got a Tpay or Tmoney card. We each added 20,000won and used it everyday for metro and bus. Everytime you pass a gate it shows you the cost and your balance left on your card. Metro cost 1250won one trip. The metro in Seoul is very clean, all exit are numbered, plans are clear and always felt safe. We used Google maps to guide us."
Very good,"Always clean, right on time, cheap and safe. Special seats for elderly and disabled, helpfull staff."
A little difficult for people that don’t speak Korean,"This metro system is one of the best I have been in around the world. It is clean, it is fast, there are shops at almost each stop, there are many stops, and it is a cheap way to get around Seoul. The only reason I rate it 4 stars instead of 5 is because unlike other metro stations, the lines don’t tell you their final destination which makes it a bit difficult to navigate. The other difficulty I experienced was figuring out how to pay to use it. The easiest (and only) way we found was to purchase prepaid T-money cards (or an equivalent) and load them with won at a convenience store. There may be other ways to pay for the metro, but we didn’t understand them. I’m sure for a Korean, it’d make much more sense and be 5 stars.Before using the metro or bus system, ask a guide/hotel front desk for advice for an app that will give you a better understanding of the system. Google maps works to some extent, but it won’t give you exact directions like it does in other countries."
Easy and cheep,"Some stations may be a bit difficult to navigate at first, but there are signs everywhere. The fair is 1250 won, so about 10 SEK.Tip: there are restrooms on every station, which are always clean! "
Great and inexpensive transportation means,"Use this service. It is extensive, 100% on schedule, easy, cheap. If you miss out onanything or got loss, the people of Seoul are friendly and helpful, even those who do not speak English. Some even walk us through to the right route."
"Amazing, punctual, Speed, Extensive Lines, Extensive Exits, Covered 100% across city lines","Transportation in South Korea? The first answer is.. Metro Train. Please download subway map and install in your mobile phone. This apps can set the from, destination and it will give you estimated travel time, cost and best train rail ways. The best of this stations are, every station has at least minimum 4 exits and maximum 11 exists so far i see from the station i went. Every station has T-money card reload kiosk machine which located usually on basement 1st floor. This kiosk machine has English option so just easy way to reload and only has option to reload using case (coin/paper). Remember some subway has 5 basement levels which the lowest use for train. There are shopping places too. The navigation and labels of the station all in both Korean and English which is easy for all tourist to follow and understand. However its hard to find ""Information"" counter for each station. I would say you need to walk alot when using this subway. For those has disabled parties or walking problem (knee pain,etc) not really advisable to use subway cause you'll need to walk a lot within the subway entrance and exit itself. Seoul station is one of main inter-station where you can take express train and bus for long journey. Every places has kiosk machine."
Efficent,"Used the metro a lot over 5 days and by purchasing a travel card we were able to uses buses and the metro seamlessly. Very clean, well light and efficient "
Si big,"So many stops, so many lines, so big.Even the stations are big, you can have 15 entrances in one station, very difficult to take the right one.Better remember the way out your hotel is located, otherwise very difficult to find. I went out at a wrong entrance and somebody told me to take a taxi to go to my hotel .... imagine the distance."
Best way to get around Seoul if visiting for more than a day or so.,"Ditch the expensive tours (unless really pressed for time or have no option) and get around Seoul on the efficient and easy-to-use public transport network. If you're visiting Seoul for more than a day or so, buying a T-money card (for tourists) from any Metro station is a great way to get around the city on Metro trains and buses. You also get discounted entry to some attractions and can use the card at some shops, e.g. 7-Eleven and others. Purchasing the card is the most challenging part of the process, but it's not really complicated if you just take your time and read the instructions (select the English option if, like me, you don't speak Korean). Once you have the card, just keep an eye on the balance as you go through the turnstiles, and top it up as necessary. Remember, if travelling on the buses, you have to touch the card ON and OFF. If you don't touch off, it will continue to charge you! "
Clean!,"Beautifully decorated, clean and fast. Easy to get around with signs and announcements in English. The subway cars are spacious, the tracks are inaccessible, behind glass gates."
Metro,"Quick, convenient, clean and cheap. Reliable transportation without traffic delays. It is a great option."
Easiest way to get around,"Not really an activity but I would say this is the easiest way to get around in Seoul. Once you know where to get the T-Money card (at a convenience store) it is super easy to get around. There are signs in English everywhere (although learning Hangeul is always convenient). Be aware that changing from one line to another requires a lot of walking. Make sure to get a good app like Kakao Metro, it really helps a lot."
Getting Around Seoul,"For an english speaker that had a lot of trouble trying to learn Hangul; the Seoul Metro really seemed to be the best way to get around. I recommend you spend a bit of time researching the system online first as well as downloading the smartphone app to be able to find and identify stations. I used a combination of the app along with Google directions and the 3D maps on the walls of the stations to get around. Use Google to find general directions and thew app to identify stations. Each station has a number and they are in numerical order along the individual lines. By knowing the number of your station on the line you are travelling and comparing it with the signs on the walls showing the numbers of the station you are in along with the one in either direction you can tell if you are going in the correct direction. It is also a good idea to know the station at the line ends as this is what is displayed on the destination signs. After the first couple of times it makes sense.There is good access to most of the city and it is quite inexpensive. I recommend the Korea Tour card which costs 4000 won (1000 won = around 1 USD) and can be added to as needed. In total over my week I used 30000 won for a lot of getting around. Tap the card getting on and off and you won't be charged for transfers to connecting buses.The trains are clean and the people are very polite with it being common for people to offer their seats. All stations I went through had restrooms that were well marked. The signage was all in English as well as Korean.One thing that may be a bit different is that there are no where near the number of escalators as other systems I have used. There are elevators available but you need to route yourself accordingly to use them. It was only an issue for me when I was hauling the suitcase arriving and leaving. The stairs and tunnels can be quite long though, so anyone with mobility issues should be prepared to scout out the stations to make sure they can find and use the elevators.The number of lines ensure good coverage of the city. All in all, having a public transit background in Toronto, I was impressed and though it was a valuable tool to exploring and enjoying the city."
Easy to use - but STAIRS everywhere ,"Convenient self serve multi lingual Top-up machines. We grabbed a metro stored value card from a convenience store right beside the turnstiles of the nearest station to our hotel. Followed the prompts of the Top-up kiosks and used cash to add money so we could spend the days exploring Seoul using the Metro. Downloaded an App for quick and easy trip planning between destinations. Rush hour after work let out was crowded, but the rest of the day was pleasant. There are plenty to stairs at every station to reach the platforms - where as other major cities use escalators and moving walkways to get you on your way safely and quickly. Not ideal to use the metro if you have luggage with you. That point was driven home when we saw a family of 4 struggling with a sleeping toddler in arms, a babe asleep in a pram and two LARGE suitcases trying to carve a place to fit in, on top of juggling the physical load. (Other passengers were just courteous enough to not hinder them ... but we notice a general lack of courtesy towards others here that would make it difficult for people with physical disabilities or a person struggling with baggage or a child stroller etc). "
Can Be Confusing,"I have often used the Seoul Metro to get around during my three visits to this marvelous city and I have yet to master the system. The app hasn't worked for me nor a detailed metro map. The problem occurs as soon as I enter a station. The poor signage (in English and Korean) fails to clearly show where to go to get a train heading in the needed direction. I often chose incorrectly and had to exit the platform and use another ticket to get to the correct one. Some platforms fail to show all the stops, just the next one, which only was helpful if I planned to get off at that stop. When I eventually reached my destination, I often had to climb myriad stairs to get outside. Though I sometimes found an elevator, it generally did not lead to where I needed to be. Escalators exist in some places but some were out of order.On my first visit to Seoul, I quickly learned to avoid the metro until 10 a.m. and between 5 and 7 p.m., because those seem to be the busiest hours. Otherwise, I rarely experienced crowded conditions. Other passengers have always been courteous to me and many have stopped to assist when I was obviously lost. One man walked with me for about 10 minutes to ensure that I got on the correct train.I generally was able to get a seat in the car I entered, and the cars I rode in were clean. A recording in Korean, followed by English, alerts passengers to the next stop. Instructions at ticket machines are in Korean and English.Sometimes I had no problems in getting from point A to point B on the metro. But because that was never a sure thing, I walked whenever possible."
A lot of connectivities,"Visited in May 2016A lot of connectivities, multiple colours for different line. Clear navigation by downloading the metro app with instruction on which line to go to, and the schedule of arrival of the metro.Clean, and packed with commuters. All in korean so you really need the app"
Clean convenient and cost effective,Seoul metro is the best way to getting around in seoul on time and cost effect way to sightseeing. Only issue for foreigners is to make sure you have good subway map .
Beautiful,"This is a must see. The history, the beauty, the experience is something everyone should have a chance to experience. The changing of the guard ceremony is worth getting there before 10:00 am."
Too many steps,"The metro map is very handy, but the metro map within the station has to be studied, to take the train going the right way. For older people, like us, the many steps that leads to an exit, is a killer and we decided after a week to abandon the metro"
Clean and easy to use,"Cars and station platforms very clean. Travel was easy to maneuver, especially with the free app. Super inexpensive, too. "
No lifts,"I was taking subway from seoul to myeongdong with my luggage. Lots of steps and at couple locations, escalator in maintenance. I had help at seoul station to buy ticket (machine didnt take my note) and the station lady was very helpful. Otherwise the subway was fast and efficient."
Easy and fast,Easy to get around Seoul. All machines are English and if you are not sure I am sure someone will stop to help. One of the cleanest subways I have been on.
"Fast, Clean and Fun.",A true tase of local culture. Our trip was a true adventure and we met some great local people who were eager to help us out with routes and stops. The trains were incredible clean and the presence of metro staff members keep things well organized. VERY safe.
Best way to travel when in seoul,"This is the ultimate way of travelling. You might have a little problem navigating in the beginning but trust me you will get over that. Its quite cheap and very fast to travel with the metro and you will enjoy watching all the people that are buried in the phones. I have never seen so many people at the same time with their head in their phones, almost 100% of the people did it :)"
Excellent signage and use of English made the Metro easy to use,"While the subway map may have made it look a bit daunting, the excellent signage and use of English, for example at the ticket vending machines, meant actual use was relatively simple"
Easy to navigate,"catching the Metro was fun, and really unlocked Seoul. Much cheaper than taxis and quicker to, really felt like a local"
We were impressed!,"We also were impressed with the Seoul Metro. It is clean, efficient, safe, well marked with English signs, cheap and convenient. Definitely buy a T-money card (at any station). It is refundable, less a very small deposit, at the end of your trip."
Love korean metro,"We just loved korean metro and used only that to move aroud in Seoul. It is very clean, easy, afficient and cheep way to get almost everywhere in Seoul."
The best way to go around,"Seoul has one of the best metros. Wide network, safe, very clean. Metro stations are big but signs are everywhere and info is coming also in English."
wonderful system,The Metro system of Seoul is a cheap and convenient way to explore the city. Buy a T-money card and you're ready to go.
very convenient ,you can go everywhere by subway in Seoulvery clean and convenient t money cards reduce your time to buy a ticketsit is able to charge at a subway station
efficient,"Although confusing finding your way around at times, especially when it's your first visit to Seoul. Just make sure that the metro is going where you want to go?? But that aside it's an amazing and efficient way of getting around and the Uk could learn a lot from them. they run often and mostly on time."
Download Naver Maps and Subway Korea,"Make sure you check the next station (in the direction you are heading towards) after the one you are at, to ensure you are going in the correct direction. Most platforms have both direction trains on the same platform. Buy a T-Money Card at a convenience store outside of Seoul Station. The actually $ you are putting on the card needs to be paid in cash. Add more money at the automated machines at any metro station (again cash only).Naver Maps is how we got around everywhere. Rent the WiFi-egg at the airport so that you always have access."
Get the app!,"The subway in Seoul is very easy to navigate, a smooth ride and very reasonably priced. The KakaoMetro app is free, very helpful, easy to use and gives excellent information."
Connected with many lines,"Seoul is can connected with many lines with different entry and exit. Walking is must, it will take a while to be oriented to use the metro effectively. It is a cheap travelling by metro to go to places of interest. Always know where to exit and where to entry in order to save a fews steps of walking. For example, my longest ride was f 17 stops cost me 2150 won, that is cheap. I strongly recommend to purchase the T Card with stored value instead of buying one way ticket. I was informed that the T Card has no expiry date, and u can always keep for your next visit. I also found that the station and train are clean, but the station are not user friendly, many steps to climb.There are english signage directions in the metro station and also walking directions within the station."
Efficient way around Seoul,"When travelling in Seoul, the metro is a convenient option to get around. They run frequently, and have numerous connections to different lines, and most areas you will visit are within a 5-10 min walk from the metros. The lines are clearly labelled (lines are numbered) and although it may be confusing at the start to determine the direction, apps such as Kakao Maps and City Mapper were really useful in determining the direction, waiting time and even exit to use to get to your destination. Trains are also clean and comfortable to travel. It may get a little busy during peak hours, but trains are spaced between 3-5 mins apart."
Wonderful system,"Seoul metro, combined with nation rail system, has over 15 different lines with frequent stops. One can travel to almost anywhere in Seoul proper with less than $2 per trip including all transfers. It is the most comfortable and clean subway I've experienced in over 12 different cities- including Paris, Barcelona, Madrid, Rome, New York, Los Angeles, Edinburgh, Berlin, New Castle, etc. All tracks are completely enclosed by lucite walls with automatic doors so dusts are contained for passengers (and prevents suicide attempts and acidents). All cars and stains are well lit, temperature controlled and extremely safe. One needs to buy T-money card which can be one time use or loaded with fund and reused. Purchasing this card can be tricky since it is sold by convenient stores within the station, not at the kiosks- the machine only issues a single ride ticket which has a premium."
Very efficient ,"Very easy, efficient and not very expensive. Very convenient especially for visitors to the city. The maps are very user friendly and also in English. The announcements on the train and on platforms were also in English and Korean. The metro covers the whole city and getting to ant corner is very easy as long as you can make sure there is credit on your T card. The card can be bought at many convenience store and recharged at the station. Travelling on the Seoul Metro was an enjoyable experience and I recommend any visitor to the city to use it."
"Despite high congestion, keeps a friendly profile","It is a rather vast network of underground rails! However, it is quite friendly with the tourists, as it provides translation in English, Korean and Chinese! "
Mommyof4,"We decided to take the metro on a recent trip. It was so easy! We purchased the card at the airport. The trains run frequently and on time. They are clean! They are easy to navigate, and best, they are very cost effective!"
Very easy to understand,"Spent a lot of time on the Metro, it was great for getting around Seoul. Stations all have the large glass walls to keep people off tracks and the trains are easier to understand than in Tokyo. Be careful through the station use turnstiles and it was hard to get strollers through. Be sure to get a t money card for ease of use, it also works on buses. "
Gets you around the whole city!,"This was one of the few times that I had to ride the metro all day, every day. Being from the city of cars, Los Angeles, I wasn't used to riding the metro to get from one place to another. Using a metro app for the stops and the metro bus app, you can pretty much get anywhere with a little walking and timing.to get from one side of the city, I stayed at DMC to the east side of the city, is about 1.5 hours. Finding everything in between you can really make use of the extensive metro network.There is also a huge underground subway culture, with its own food and bakeries and retail booths. Some mom and pop and others slightly bigger, such as Daiso.Go prepared with comfortable shoes and get ready to walk, but its worth it. Every stop is audible in English and Korean. At times it can get crowded but you'll get the hang of it real quick."
Clean and a bit confusing,"The subways system is large and efficient and the tickets are very affordable, at least compared to the Stockholm (Sweden) subway system. As most subway systems around the world this one is also very packed at rush hour, and you will have to be prepared to stand up. You can easily buy tickets at the stations in machines but only with cash. If you want to buy a subway card to load this can be done in convenience stores, but also only with cash!"
"Really clean, nice, and efficient metro system, but confusing to get tickets","Being from Washington DC, I'm used to what we consider a clean and modern metro system. However, from what I could see the Seoul system as good or more likely better. Frequent trains, extremely extensive and comprehensive lines and stops blanket the metropolitan area, making the old and constantly breaking DC system--with it's meager coverage and expensive fares--seem vastly inferior.Lessons learned: packed at rush hour, expect to stand and be pressed against the other travelers (women should take a note of their comfort with this); and second be prepared for very confusing ticketing machines, which are CASH ONLY (seriously?? this is a big problem in this century), really confusing for even first time Koreans, and even worse with limited English. For example, some machines will cheerfully take your 10,000 Won note, acknowledge the value correctly, think for 5 seconds, and then error out cancelling the entire transaction without explanation--turns out those machines only accept up to 5000 Won notes."
Savvy Subway Riding in Seoul,"Get Tmoney card at convenience store; reload card for subway, buses, airport bus, etc. EZ system to get around Seoul."
Interesting Train Arrival System,"Music will be played when the train is arriving. Also the Train arrival system showing the info in the LCD is very unique, at least to me. It shows where the train is, 2 stations away."
granies,great place if you want to old Korean women fighting in a very crowded placeand it is warm in the winter
Cheap. Easy. ,"I ventured cross town on the metro. It’s cheap, about $1 per ride, and east to use. Well signed. Gets crowded at rush hours. Signage is good and doubled in English. "
Quick trip to Seoul: first time,"Family of 3 adults. Transport around City very easy - particularly as we bought our AMAZINGPAY cards at Airport for Won 50,000 (including Won 4,000 fee). We used it everywhere and topped up at 7-11."
Good experience. Easy accessible.,Directions were made simple for non-korean speaking tourist. They numbered all their stations and exits which made navigation a hell lot easier.Was travelling with 2 high luggages. To only thing irking is the lack of escalators and lift. Had to hand carry the whole flight of stairs.
Efficient way to go around Seoul,"The Seoul Metro was a bit complicated to use, and without a proper app one might feel a bit overwhelmed and lost around the metro. However, it is an efficient and fast way to go around the city. The trains are clean and fast. Totally recommended."
"Convenient, clean and inexpensive ","Easy to use for foreigner, convenient for connections with buses, and the best part is that within a time limit of 30 minutes any transfers is free of charge."
Clean and efficent subway system in and aruond Seoul!,"Clean,super reliable and convenient! You can go almost anywhere in Seoul using the metro. It is comparable in quality to the ones in Tokyo, Hong Kong and Singapore."
"Wow what a big metro ! cheap to go anywhere , try it !!!",I never saw such a bigger metro in the world !!!!! About 360 stations plus trains .....easy to lost yourself specially in this nearly ALL Korean language lol
Great connectivity,"The subway has great connectivity although you have to walk quite a bit inside to get to the tracks, ticket vending machine available outside. Language a little bit of a problem."
Korail Seoul to Busan,"Korail KTX train is very comfortable and convenient way to travel between cities in Korea. Ticketing online is quite easy but the selection of seats on the train is not intuitive. But once you get over the booking and reservation, getting the physical ticket at the station is a breeze. All you have to do is to present your e-ticket at the counter and the officer will present you the ticket. Train departure is also quite prompt. One has to check on the platform to board and the train car where your seats are located."
Ease of use,Used the subway system extensively in Korea and was a joy to use and navigate after using the subway in JapanUsed the express train from the airport to seoul and the all stop train from Seoul station back to IncheonWould recommend the all stop as leaves every 15 minutes compared to 45 minutes and only takes an extra 15 minutes to get there at half the priceUsing the subway and navigation was easy and takes you to most of the key areas in SeoulMap availible at stations is very good
Perfect Metro,"Good, on time, easy. Can go anywhere around Seoul. The cost is acceptable. The service is excellent."
Easy and cheap,"Easy to use, frequent and cheap. Not many seats so be prepared to stand even in off peak hours. Some stations are quite a long way down and not all have escalators,"
Convenient and reasonable,Love the metro. Not difficult to navigate. Overall a comfy and clean train..the ride is pretty smooth.
Ease of access,The Seoul metro is easy to use. You have to buy a refillable card to get around because it does not make sense to have single journey tickets. You can only refill the card with cash not credit card. The arex (airport express train) is reasonably priced and you can use it to the city instead of the all stop train. I enjoyed the AREX with the extra I spent. The all stop train feels forever. 
Need more effort to know the train track,"Seoul train is not comfort enough than mrt (singapore), but its still ok. The problem is ... a few alphabet signage :p lol... if you go to seoul , you must learn about train route first.. "
"Great network, but not tourist friendly","The Seoul Metro station is amongst the most complex metro/train stations I have travelled on. The Seoul metro station itself has over 20 exits, so unless you are very clear on which exit you need to take, it can get very confusing and you can land up in a place very far from where you want to be. So tip#1, when getting off at Seoul metro station, be very clear which exit you need to take. If not sure, ask around.The 2nd challenge is that the ticket vending machines dont accept cash or credit card. You need to have a travel card which is a prepaid card. So as a tourist you kind of get stuck trying to buy a ticket."
the easiest metro in Asia !,"Clean, with a really wide network which can even take you out in great lanscapes among mountains for instance, the metro in Séoul is also very easy to use.First use your credit card to buy a T card, for a cheap price (as in London, for instance) : go to the machines in the station (and select the langage : English); then indicate the amount you want to deposit (a simple trip is about 1500 KTW). Everytime you will enter a metro station, your card will be checked for the credit and will register where you entered. The corresponding amount will be debited as getting out, according to the length of your trip.The card may also be used in City busses.On the platform, the lines are indicated by their number and colour, but also by their last station. But you also have the name of the NEXT station the metro is coming from and going to :for instance on the platform of City Hall, you will see ""Jonggak –> City Hall –> Seoul"" Station.In each car, you have a screen AND an announce of the next station, which is repeated in English : and the pronounciation of the name of the station in Korean does correspond quite well to what an Eurpean would naturally pronounce when he reads the European version (which would't be the case in Chinese, for instance).The pictograms have been well designed, and are quite easy to understand.When you get out for a transfer, please beware of the numbers and do not mistake the number of the line you want to transfer to with the number of the exit (the exit are usually indicated on yellow). To avoid that mistake and also make a swift transfer (rush hour can be really busy), the indications ""transfer to"" are sometines indicated on the ground, with a line you can follow : for instance, transfer to a green line will appear with a green ""tread"" of tiles on the ground platform (in Busan for instance).But if you are used to more ancient (and historical) metro, as in Paris or Budapest, remember that the distance between 2 stations is longer, and stations can spread on a wide area : you will have to walk more to enter, exit or transfer. In the oldest station, you do not always have an escalator : if you have luggage, better to look for the elevator, but you probably will have to get in line for it, so be sure not to be in a hurry."
Very Good,"On our first trip to Seoul we were a bit worried about using the Metro, however we found everything so easy to use and the staff were great."
not so accessible friendly for people who on wheelchair,"we hardly find path to enter it with wheelchair, people who saw our need also never help. one of the mid age auntie even short cut our queue while we want to exit. they should consider more for the needs of people, too many stairs, not wheelchair friendly."
Subway in Korea,"Korea subway Stn is different from Singapore, those who having big luggages you will have trouble climbing up the stairs I myself is physically fit to walkaround each day for 8-10 hours a day during my trip in Korea, To be honest I myself also struggling carry my Luggage going up and down so I decided to take Taxi to the stn."
English signs available,"I was afraid at first that we would get lost in Seoul because the train system seemed so large and complex, and that the station names would be in Korean Script. Luckily, I was wrong. It was daunting in the beginning but if you know where you're going and which stops and routes to take then you can navigate with ease around Seoul via the Metro. The PA delivers announcements in Korean, English, and Chinese. Likewise, the LCDs also have a multi-language display if you didn't quite hear the PA. I traveled with two children and the people were very polite and gave them their seat as the children were not tall enough to hold on to the handles."
Can be confusing,"We found that riding the buses was easier than the subways as we could keep our maps open to make sure we were going the right direction. However, we got on the wrong subway quite a few times because some of the stations do not have signs of the direction the subway is going in, and maps don't work underground. One time we asked a young adult and he nodded that we were going the right direction, but we hopped on only to realize, it was going the opposite direction! "
works for tourists,"some signs are in english and tickets can be bought at machines where english is selectable as language. Dont forget to refund your oneridetickets after arriving, 500 WON refund."
Easy to use,"If you use the metro/subway to move around in Seoul, you MUST download the apps which is very useful cos can use it offline. Best! Make sure to buy the T money card. If you buy the ticket, its a hassle to always having to get a refund 500₩ at the machine. Moreover, theres a discount of 100₩ if you use the T money card. A minimium fare of 1250₩ (discounted) is charged and additional fare 100₩ or more is charged depending on distance travelled."
Perfect way to travel,"So clean, so easy to use, so good. I'm giving my recomendation as for great metro solution. Using and uploading transport card is a simple system."
"Clean, efficient, cheap","I was initially unsure as to how easy it would be to navigate around not being able to understand Korean. However, all the ticket machines work in English, all the signs are easy to understand and colour coded for the different lines.It's great value and you can also buy travel passes which are re-loadable. Most fares are around £1/$1 single so its a great way to get around. If you do get into difficulty and get stuck at a barrier for example then the station staff are incredibly helpful and polite."
Perfect transportation for first time travelers,"It was my first time in Seoul but riding the Seoul Metro was an easy thing because all the signages have English translations for foreign travelers. Also, the exits and transfer signs are easy to follow. Very impressive!"
Finding an exit can be tough!,"The metro in Seoul is brilliant, however we found some stations difficult to get out of as they were too confusing. It’s cheap and easy to use otherwise though."
One of the best rail systems in the world.,"I travel a lot and this is a huge system.Very cheap to use.In the trains it is in Korean but they usually have an English speaking lady who will tell you what station is coming up.You can download a free english version of the entire network from Play Store called Korea Rail.It is very easy to follow.Working out which exit to leave the station is important because you can end up a long way from where you need to be.If you are here for a while you can get a ""Safex""card from a convenience store of station master for 4000 won and then recharge it.It is more convenient than buying individual tickets."
Transfer,"The subway in Seoul is one of the best subway systems. Very easy to understand cause they separate subway line in a different color also each station have a number if you don’t remember the name instead of that remember the number is easier. If you transfer to the basic zone within 30 minutes exp. you catch a bus then you don't have to pay the fee. But if you transfer to the bus in a different zone you have to pay 100w. At the information counter, you can get a subway map in the English version."
efficient and convenient ,Machines easy to operate and with the traffic in Seoul this mode of transport quite convenient except that they dont have escalators which could be a challenge for those with strollers as well as the elderly.
Seoul metro ,Excellent and easy to use . Use preloaded cards for ease of use. Cards can be use for purchase in convenience shops. 
"Smooth, clean and efficient","No matter what city I travel, I always take the metro system and Seoul was my latest adventure. I was ready for almost anything, but what I encountered was amazing.Not only is the metro system efficient, it is extraordinarily clean and easy to use. Once you navigate through the language barrier you have no problem whatsoever. It is relatively inexpensive to travel across Seoul and you avoid the heavy traffic. Of course, you want to stay away from rush hour if you can as Seoul is a densely populated city with a large number of commuters.The cars are comfortable and everyone is extraordinarily helpful and polite. Loved the system."
Seoul Metro is the best way to get around in Seoul!,"Make sure to use the KakaoMetro app for easy on- and offline navigation. And the T-Money Card (in any convenience store or kiosk) to pay for the fares. All station names are written in korean AND in latin spelling. In the Metro cars , english names of stations are displayed and also narrated over the speaker = really easy to use for tourists!"
Really good metro system ,One of the best metros I’ve ever seen worldwide. Lots of people but lots of trains running around in a short amount of time. Very good!
Best way to get around,"I had heard great things about the metro and they are all true. It is easy to get yourself setup but warning, you will need Korean currency. No problem if you come into Seoul Station from the airport. Once at Seoul, find an ATM, get cash, then walk over to the many vending machines that say T-Money Cards. Each card will run about 4000 Won. Next, find a metro Kiosk, and recharge the card for the amount you want and off you are.The metro is easy and I recommend downloading the KakaoMetro app which will make figuring out what train to use so easy. All the signs are English making it that much easier to use. "
Everyone is ready to Help You..!,It was great experience travelling by Seoul Metro. It is a very good transport mode to travel across the city. Download the metro app which will help you find the route. If you are confused for anything ask from fellow travelers. They are always more than willing to help you find right route. 
A great metro,"As a first timer in Seoul, it was great to find that the Seoul Metro was very easy to use. I also downloaded an App called 'subway' which was a map of the system just in case! All the names are in Korean & English. I must also mention that there is a large number of public toilets in the subway system and they are all sparkling clean! Very impressive!"
A Piece of Cake ,"Definitely this subway was tremendous, for tourists is not easy reading the names of the stations, but everything became quite simple once I downloaded some apps from the AppStore that aid me how to move into the subway (“Seoul Subway”). You can get anywhere in Seoul using the subway, also is “cheap” compared to the other transports. "
Easy to navigate and pretty cheap!,"Don't be afraid of using local transportation! All signs were also in English and there is always someone around that speaks English to help. The cost is cheap, you buy a card load it up with some money and you are all set. It took us 1 day to learn the basics. Be adventurous and hop on the metro or even a bus, it is the best way to experience locals."
So easy and convenient,"I love it, Easy and Convenient to move Seoul. Clean And Safety also. Everybody enjoy Seoul Metro system."
Very Good Metro,"We visited Seoul for a week and used the subway as our main mode of transportation. Wanting to see it all, we criss-crossed the city many times.Most signs are in English, so it is easy to navigate without knowing Korean. Seoul Metro covers a lot of ground - so if you're going from one end of Seoul to another, expect to be on the train for a while. I found the train cars wider than most other cities and provided a more roomier feel. The stations, platforms, and trains are very clean and the system is very safe.There are a few drawbacks, however. We bought subway cards that had a somewhat expensive deposit. We could not easily return those cards for a refund. I suggest skipping that.Each ticket is its own little card which has a small deposit. We quickly became habituated to turning in the cards for the refund as we exited. While this isn't such a headache, it does add time to the trip.Some of the exit stairs are very steep. I believe all stations have elevators to the street, so there are options if you have a disability or if you are wheeling heavy luggage.Overall, Seoul Metro is highly recommended"
Easy and Friendly To Move Around ,"Very convenience to go around places, easy to use. We bought T money from convenience store and use it to travel around. We can top up the credits in the metro. "
Seoul metro rides,Very efficient rides.Connectivity to different places within Seoul is great.Convinient rides especially during the winter time.
"LOVE IT, Clean, Effective and Cheap","Seoul Metro system is on point. It's not hard to figure out like some Tokyo where you go to the same place roundtrip but you end up taking different routes for higher prices. You can relatively go to anywhere by the metro to include the airports effectively for a great price that I consider a bargain to get around the cities and it's suburbs. I hardly drive in Seoul because of the metro, that's a plus."
Good and efficient subway,"The subway come very frequently and clean. Many passengers are well mannered when it comes to onboarding and offboarding, except there is a certain category, that seem self entitled. Of course, this also applies to other countries."
"Reliable, clean transport","A great way to get around, even for someone with limited Korean language skills.Tip - Download their app - it's easy to use and makes figuring out which trains you need and how they connect a simple task."
World best!,"Clean, spacious, reliable, SAFE, super efficient, brings you everywhere, anouncements in 4 languages, absolutely fool proof. Your fellow travellers will be clean and nice to look at. They all look at their smart phones, you remain invisible to them. Only the seniors will push you aside to reach their reserved seats, you are not supposed to compete for them unless you are yourself visibly a senior."
Very easy to use once you figure out the lines and the exits. We found our way easily.,"Very accessible except for loys of stairs, but a great way to get around the cityWe were able to navigate easily on our iwn"
Sightseeing in Seoul,"Whilst on business in Seoul, I have used the local Metro to get around the City and recommend it.Ticket machines have an English option. Single tickets are available, just make sure you get the 500 Won refund from the separate machines at the end of your journey."
Endless connectivity,"This subway map is a nightmare to figure out because there are so many train lines.Charge is about usd1.2 per trip.User a stored value card that can be bought at the convenience store, and refunded there also.Always stuck in traffic jams most of the day."
Overall very good,"It is practical, well signed, the only thing, the names in English are small but still if you go close, it may be easier to go through. Only one thing I noted, some stations, you need to check first to which side you want to go. I think it was Sinchon, there were entrances on both sides and therefore I got into the closest entrance to realize I needed to go the other platform but you needed to go out again. A local person did the same mistake and was trying to cross back to the other side. Just pay attention and it will be ok."
Convenient way to explore Seoul ,Traffic in Seoul appears to be getting bad and the metro is a good way to beat this. Seoul metro is very convenient and easy to take. 
National University (line 2 green line) to Namdaemun station,Underground on the green line is really good. Every in - 1 min 20 seconds there is a station. Therefore anyone near this large looping green line can access stations on this line. It crosses the majority of other important lines both sides of the river ticketing machines are littered everywhere in multiple areas and is cheap. This trip of some 14 stations was approx $1.60 the same taxi trip costs $ 12 but more direct but depending on time of day quicker. Peak hour the train a quicker. If it’s raining catch a taxi as walking from station to your hotel there is a genuine lack of lean too roofing on pavements (winter snow is heavy) travel on train is comfortable and old people have priority and seats at end of each carriage. signposting at stations very good with directions of trains and above ground street directions easy to see and understand. 
Convenience,"Compare to Japan subway system, Seoul metro is very easy to follow. Just know where you're going, which line you're taking and familiarize your exit. We stayed close to Seoul Station, which is the transportation hub of Seoul. Google maps doesn't work well in Seoul, but I used ""rome2rio"" for trip planning. There's also free apps for Seoul metro that we've tried using but after 3 days, we got comfortable and confident without using any help. The only bad experience we had using their metro was the airport limo bus drivers. They were not being helpful, very impatient when we did not understand them. I mean these drivers are dealing with tourists all the time, they should have some basic English knowledge or at least have some friendly dispositions, towards guests. Other than this disappointing experience, taking the metro is the cheapest way to get around Seoul."
The most convenient way to go around Seoul,"A ride is about 1,250 KRW. Pretty easy to navigate and topping up is simple. Make sure to download the latest subway map as new stations are always added."
Confusing at first,"Thankfully I have a teenager with some basic understanding of Korean to help navigate. After a few days things became much easier but the initial impression is utter confusion. The underground network is so incredibly expansive! Would be helpful if there were more subway maps around, there were too few sprinkled around. And as a tourist, suggest avoiding rush hour for the sheer mass of commuters moving around. You'd just feel in the way trying to figure out where you need to go while everyone rushes around you. Fairly clean and lots of food at most stations. Always felt safe, at anytime of day or even late at night. No homeless or scary people, and didn't smell bad as some other major metro city subway systems internationally. I've experienced NYC, San Francisco, London, and Paris subway systems and Seoul and Paris were the best in terms of above metrics. "
"Easy to understand, difficult with heavy luggage","Their metro is one of the things I love about South Korea. It's easy to understand, the stations are conveniently located, and of course fast! Very much different from the train system here in Philippines. Although the metro is connected in the airport and it would be very convenient to travel via train; the lack of elevators and escalators in some stations, would make it a little hassle."
quick and friendly..perfect transportation,"Went from airport to my hotel in an 1.5 hr. Traffic can be terrible in Seoul. The metro was easy to get at airport, had English for buying ticket, clean, very save, easy to change lines as I had to do. As easy as the T in Boston or MTR in HK or MRT in Singapore."
4 day city visit,"Loved getting around on the metro very similar to the London Underground so easy to use and reasonably priced, instead of using taxis, which can end up sitting in a lot of traffic! There are 10 million people living in seoul! "
Efficient,We use this as a mode of transportation during our travel. The service is so efficient and the train arrival time is punctual. The subway itself is so colorful and the subway system is efficient.
Easy to navigate,English translations can be found of station names and for ticket purchasing. The don’t May be a bit small in some cases but it was possible to navigate without assistance. In 4 days I only used the metro once- from Dongdaeipgu (Dongguk University) to the Anguk station ostensibly to find Hanbok Rental places on the way to changdeokgungpalace. The problem was that once we got out of the station we got disoriented and found it difficult getting help in English. The metro itself is very clean and many trains are timed like those in Tokyo so you know how long you have to wait for the next. 
Weektrip Seoul,"As in every city as large as Seoul the Metro is the best way to travel even if the taxis are relatively cheap. Best is to buy as T-card and top up the amount on this card, which goes very easy. Furthermore I can recommend to download the app for the metro which is also available in English and which is a good tool to quickly check the best route from A to B. I travelled a lot with the metro and spend about 15.000 Won so quite cheap and practical"
Awesome metro,"What a great metro system, it made a visit to Seoul easy.Samgakji was my local station check out the art whey you pass by"
So easy to use.,"The best way to travel round Seoul is to use the metro. It is easy to navigate, runs like clockwork, is clean, safe and can get you anywhere without being stuck in traffic. "
End of leg,"From Canada and found the metro easy to use, signage in English, just make sure you know your start and stop stations, easy to get ticket machines have English just need to select. Enjoy the metro "
Super system,"As a non Korean speaking visitor, I found the Metro to be very easy to use. It's well signed in English. I particularly like the fact that the next station is marked on the platforms so you can't go the wrong way Trains are frequent. The Seoul Subway App is excellent."
Long walks in the underground,"well lit, well displayed signage in English for tourists. The app works great too. Just the walking while changing lines takes the air out of you at times. Staff at various stations were friendly."
Missing in translation,"Be careful before throwing your metro ticket you can get some money back from it, or recharge it for another voyage"
Easy to use,"We found it easy to navigate our way around the metro system to reach all the sites which we wanted to visit. Signs are in both Korean and English and the same with on board announcements when approaching the stations. You need to obtain a travel card which can be purchased form CU and Seven stores, Just top up as you go at the stations, Cards can be used on the metro, buses, taxis and airport stopping service (£2:50) but not the airport express. Fares are very cheap. You can purchase a single ticket but trips are cheaper with the card (about 80 Pence per trip) for up to 12 Kilometers. When you leave you can get a refund of the amount left on your card less a 500 won fee, there is a CU store at the airport."
Very easy to navigate,"The Seoul metro is clean, organized and easy. I used the Naver app to find my way around Seoul. You can purchase a tourist metro card from a machine and then use another machine to load money into it. You check in and out as you enter and exit the metro. "
Super easy to use and get to anywhere you want,"Always remember to get your deposit back if you are using a single fare card.We used it many times and found it very easy to get. Just use the card machines, select your destination, select number of tickets and pay. "
Very simple,It is a very simple metro system in comparison to Japan. Also very clean and easy to understand. The people are nice and was never overly crowded. I took it late night though. 
Efficient!,"Our 5 day experience with Seoul Subway was a breeze. We downloaded Subway app on our phone and it really helps especially when we need to change line, because sometimes the signboards are confusing as they list down several stations along the line. and oh the stations are very clean."
Great transport system,"Seoul subway is a very comprehensive system that takes you anywhere easily. With the subway map in hand, most places of interest are within walking distance. One thing to note is, you must be sure you get through the right gantry or you will be charged for the trip though you may not have taken the ride. "
Clean and efficient,"The Seoul Metro is a great example of an efficient modern subway system. The trains usually run on time and it's easy to navigate your way around the system. The tricky bit is knowing where to obtain a travel card and how to load them. Once you manage that, you'll be fine"
Everyday commute,"Avoid office hours 8~9:30 AM and 6:30-7 pm especially line no 2, clean and ontime as always, best alternative if you wanna avoid Seoul traffic "
Good,"This was my 5th times to visit Seoul. I strongly believe they are trying their best to improve routes convenience. I used to hang on my luggage via stepping upstairs, however this time, I found there are increasingly elevator for those in need. "
An excellent public transport system,"We used the Seoul Metro for our 3 day visit to Seoul after purchasing our TMoney Card at the Airport. Compared to our recent use of Metro in Milan, Barcelona and experiences of same in Hongkong and Singapore, differences are:- Stations felt safe and free of pick-pocket types compared to the two in Europe.- overall system appears very complex, but taking time to study the map gets you to most places in Seoul easily.- Stations always have restrooms, mostly very clean, elevators are available for those less able to use the plentiful stairs.- one way fares appeared to be fixed at 1250₩ (US$1.10) for each our trips.- At this point in time, Google Map on my Cell Phone (or wife's iPhoneX) is no help finding routes from one spot to the next. I had to use search to find destination and then locate myself and decide which streets to use.My other learning is that the Metro coverage of the middle of Seoul is quite good, several stations from two or more Lines would be near the destination required, checking first may save walking further through some very crowded areas.- "
Wow,This is a train that we went to and it was fun.all the time we spent it together. Onni suri is very freindly. 
Convenient!,"We tour Seoul using subways and it was the best choice. With the traffic on the road, subways makes travelling at ease."
" Very easy to navigate, great system","Very good coverage of Seoul, well integrated with other modes such as buses and regional rail and high speed train. Gets busy and congested sometimes but overall, we got everywhere we needed with ease. Ticket vending machines are easy to use. And people are helpful to assist you with directions. Certainly it is the best was to travel in Seoul. "
Fast and cheap,The fastest way to travel from one tourist spot to another within Seoul with very low cost. Avoid the peak time and the ride brings pleasure.
East transport system,"We used the Seoul transport system with ease. We caught the fast train from the airport to Seoul Station, the trip takes around 45 minutes. The next 3 days we used the trains to get around the city and it is so quick and diverse. The ticket machines can convert to English so they are easy to use. Highly recommended this transport."
Very convenient ,Every time we sure Seoul Metro to travel around the city. It is very convenient and economical. Traffic is crazy in city and this is the best means of transport if you want to save some money and time. 
Great transport system,"My wife and I used the Seoul Metro system with ease. The machines are easy to use to get your tickets ( Yes, you can convert the screen to English). The trains are very clean and spacious. Very happy"
Average,"When we visited Seoul we tried to use the metro, it was no good experience, it was difficult to use the ticket machine and no one around to help, moreover, the tickets that we cut did not open the gate for us, we looked around the station to find a staff to help us we couldn't find till we reached their office at the end of the station. "
Don't let the spaghetti of subway lines overwhelm you!,"Despite the intimidating maze of lines spidering all over the city, riding the subway in Seoul is fairly painless and navigable without understanding the Korean language. The trains are clean, efficient and punctual. Apart from getting somewhere, to experience Seoul properly you need to go underground to see the hive of activity around subway stations. However, sometimes there can be a deceptively long walk to change subway lines, and depending on where you are going it may be faster to catch a bus."
Confused,The subway was convenient. There are a lot of English signs. They often had escalators that would go up a flight or two then stop leaving everyone to walk up stairs. It was not easily to get around with mobility issues. Some of the stations were pretty. 
One of the most convenient in the World,"Seoul Metro or subway system is one of the most convenient mode of transport in the world. Well maybe just a little confusing during the change of lines/transfer inside the stations. But overall, you can access to anywhere in Seoul."
"Quick, easy and runs late","Living in shanghai and being a daily metro user I wasn’t sure what to expect, but the metro is very convenient. Also runs past 12am, which surprised me. "
Easy & Convenient ,"Take the metro all over on your trip, we used Kakao Metro and it is simple! Adults ₩ per trip is 1,250₩ and we averaged about 4₩ per day. It’s safe quite and easy to get about."
Efficient Metro system,The Metro in Seoul is efficient and very punctual. The journey from each metro station to the next metro station takes approximately 2-3 minutes and the stations are close to many places of interest. It will be more convenient if you own a T-Money card. 
Easy to use and reachs anywhere,"It`s super easy to use, even to buy the tickets or recharge the card. And the train is very clean, impressive. "
Fast and efficient Metro,"The Metro is fast and efficient, similar to the Metro in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan, and Singapore. I recommend downloading the KaKao Metro mobile phone app when in Korea as it helps immensely. The only “downside” of the Metro in Seoul is that the locals tend to be a bit pushy when entering the train, but I supposed that’s a usual thing. "
Convenient Commute,"The Seoul Metro has evolved to become a convenient commute for Koreans and tourists. I do not know the exact amount but each trip of about 1-6 stations cost between KRW1,000-2,000. You can basically travel to any parts of Seoul on the metro. "
"So easy, so nice","I love the subway system in Seoul. With a subway map and some money, you can get anywhere. It is clean and feels so safe compared to NYC. This is my main mode of transportation when I’m in Seoul"
Easy adventure,"The metro is easy to navigate, very safe, and clean. It takes a little time but you don't have to worry about traffic or finding parking. Plus you get the bonuses of a core workout if you have to stand and people watching!"
Seoul adventure via Metro,"First time for me to ride a Metro in Seoul and I was amazed by the cleanliness and well organized system. I am not an adventure person although I love to travel... and for me to take a metro with my friend took a lot of courage. But to my surprise, metro in Seoul has English transitions everywhere and super easy to ride. Only tricky part is getting the ticket at the machine but once you read it carefully and figure out how it works, it is the best way to travel. I recommend to avoid rush hours as it can get crowded and remember to keep the ticket till you get out as you need to exit but also to retrieve your refund. "
just get the single use tickets,cheap and easy to travel around seoul. use the single tickets for trips. Do beware that you cannot transfer with the single use tickets
Excellent Network,The next section asks when did you travel. I have to supply a month! I use it all the time in Seoul. The best and cheapest subway system I have used in the world. Efficient - most lines a train every five minutes or so. Clean. By far the best way to travel around Seoul
"It let you go basically main spot in Seoul, easy and fast.","Easy to go, but must avoid peak hours, Price is reasonable and most important is free from traffic jam in Seoul. Recommand you to buy the T-money great and small piece of devices,working like a card,easy to be charged, its cheaper if you go around Seoul while using it, the best thing was that i use it with multiple functions, you can use it in the bus,taxi,subway and metro."
Efficient transportation but the stairs are tiresome!,"It's one of the most efficient and convenient mode of transport in Korea. But do be ready to climb the many, many steps when getting out from the stations. I really hope they will consider installing escalators at all the stations as the climb from the station to road level is so tiresome (averaging 50 to 60 steps)."
Easy,Easiest way to travel . Clean and every route labeled in english. Took express train from airport to Seoul station and easily used metro map to arrive at every location
Well Laid Out and Good English Signage ,Classic “postage stamp” system. All the signage is great for English-speakers. Use a T-Money card. Trains are frequent. I never waited more than a few minutes. 
Super convenient,"It definitely made our trip to Seoul much easier and cheaper. It was easy to get to our hotel from the airport in the Metro also. And from there, only you learn how to read the lines and connections it is very easy. And it runs almost every 5 minutes. Just try to avoid going before 9am, as it is super crowded. "
Metro works OK but can be crowed,The metro works fine but takes a little time to figure out. Much of it is labeled in English so it is better than other metros like Shanghai or Tokyo.
Less time Transport,You can go everywhere in Seoul by metro and it always will take less time than going by car.The metro is in good conditions and easy to understand.There is an app to check the stations and the transfers that you need to do. 
Easier to navigate than expected.,"Based on some of the reviews I read, I was expecting this place to be very difficult to navigate, since I don't speak any Korean. Not so. Easy to buy a metro card or ticket. T-money is easier and more useful. English speaking vending machines in the stations. I haven't found one that takes a credit card, though. Google maps works pretty good, navigating the metro system. Cheap! Cheaper than the trains in Tokyo, but they don't seem as fast."
"Super easy, cheap, convenient ",It’s simple. Get a Tcard and use the Seoul metro and busses. You will get wherever you need to go cheaply and quickly. Would use again and would recommend to friends. 
Great if you speak korean,Could be challenging without fluent korean The trains themselves are clean efficient and reasonably priced. Train stations are also confusing as far as exits are concerned. You may end up on the wrong side of the street unless you have precise instructions from a local resident.
Really good system !,Would be hard as all metros without google and trip advisor. Clean as and very safe to use. Some very friendly staff. Machines easy to use for multi-language users Well done ! 
Subway,"buying their subway T-Card, if buy single trip, you may get back your deposit but not the load up card. the T-Card only is 3000won, the you have to load. Very efficient and on time...extremely clean...people on the subway very friendly..."
Very cheap and convenient way to travel around Seoul!,"The Rail+ card is cheaper than the Tmoney or other transpo card available (1,000 won only)All lines are easy to use and with English text all over the place. There are only few lines that platform for both directions are not side by side."
"Clean, efficient, easy to locate.","I would highly recommend buying the t-money card and load some $ inside. You can use the T-money card for your rides and also many convenient store also takes it, so you can make purchases with the card. The metro system is great, on time and easy to navigate. The price is not bad either, around 1250 won for a trip up to 10km. You can also transfer from and to bus for free. Just make sure you tap the transfer area before getting off the bus. "
Best and punctual,Very best public transport to use and easy for those who love to have a connection to the place of interest because the station is near to the place that we want to go.For me i took a metro from itaewon to Olympic Park and its walking distance from station to the park. They have a information counter for tourist.
Easy to Travel,"I mainly stayed in Seoul and traveled using the subway. It connects most of the areas in and near Seoul.To be honest, I loved using the subway system more than the bus. "
Esy,"Nice and easy to use and lot of officers there to help us , if you know the line then you are okay .Nothing more to say just take care know the line and off you go"
The easiest way to get around Seoul. ,"Seoul Metro is the easiest and most economical way to get around Seoul. There is no need to take taxis as there is almost always a station near by. Pro tip: get s T-Money card (a prepaid card that can be used on public transportation, 7-11s and even some music venues). Download Kakao Metro app to guide you around the city."
"Fast, easy to use and affordable","Pretty easy to understand, some steps if you can't find the elevator. Very affordable, fast and convenient."
Connects north and south well,"Staying in Gangnam-gu for business I found it a good way to reach the cultural sites north of the river. Distances are quite big although not obvious on the map. Anguk is the station close to Isadong, you walk to the other sites from there too, like the old Bukchon Hanok village, Folk museum or even Royal palace.Stations are numbered which it is easy buying tickets."
Crowded with people,"I think this is the best thing to do, because even locals do it. Enjoy the train ride which is easy and comfortable. The maps is confusing like a dictionary"
Efficient metro system to move around Seoul,We spent 5 days in Seoul exploring various sites in the city almost entirely using the metro. This is the most efficient and economical way of moving around this sprawling capital city with many attractions located within walking distance of metro stations. Another big plus is that there are many toilets at the metro stations which was a very pleasant surprise. Most other major city metros are very stingy on offering toilet facilities for whatever reasons. Seoul metro scores number one on my list on this. 
I hope they will increase the announcement speaker volume,Korean’s train tend to be more noisy than Japan’s train. Noises are both from the voice of the passengers and the sound of the train. Sometimes i almost missed my stop because i can’t hear the announcement stop. Also the announcement tv board (especially for English) is passed so fast.
It can still be improved ,The metro is just okay. Nothing fancy. The trains look tired and there is minimal English translations. The signage inside the train has small fonts for English. It was kinda difficult. The JR trains is Japan are much better. Even the train in Bangkok is better!
It's a world class with the cheap price,Korea has one of the best subway system in the world at the really cheap price only problem is the they don't service from midnight to 4am.
Convenient,Near to all or most tourist attractions. You also should stay near to Myeongdong station or Chungmuro Station. It's so convenient!
Clean and Easy,"Best way to commutes, The walk way is big, the wheelchair easy to accessible. Each subway have the toilet and clean!!!"
Supremely functional ! ,"Piece of cake to use - clear instructions, very civilized and very clean. You definitely do not need a taxi. "
Seoul Subway System,"One of the best subway systems in the world. It's a safe, clean, comfort, convenient, recommended for everyone visiting Seoul."
Easy to figure out,"I was afraid to travel in Seoul because I wasn't sure if I could navigate the subways. I was ready to take taxis everywhere. But the Seoul metro is so easy to figure out. It allowed me to be among local residents from all walks of life. I enjoyed every ride, even when it was crowded."
Metro,"Clean, very well organized, efficient and affordable. Stop information is given in 4 languages. Plenty of clean restroom facilities. "
Metro,Seoul Metro is very easy and convenient to use. Signs are written in English just make sure that you take the correct train as there is all stop and express.
Metro Easygoing ,"We have been using the metro to get around Seoul, I got the App KakaoMetro and this made travel a lot easier, we got the Travel card at a metro station and loaded some cash onto it, as you pass on and off the turnstiles give you a balance read on your cards credit "
Good transportation,"sometimes might confusing, but cheap price, good transportation I used Line no.2 and 3 most. And during traffic hours, its best!"
Pleasant rides everytime,"Love their trains! Always on time, spacious cabins and the routes are easy to negotiate even for a first timer."
Very nice,Soeul subway is a great way to get around in Seoul. It is very easy to find the way since everything is clear with signs in English aswell as Korean
The fastest way to get to your destination ,"Seoul subway is superb, comfortable, safe and fast. It has a lot of branches, but you can’t get lost. The clues will help you to find needed line and train. Each branch has its own colour; in the subway all of the indexes are in English, Korean, which are definitely necessary for foreigners. Trains coming are behind a glass doors, which open when the train is came. That is the main reason of safeness. You can download subway map, but what are you going to do if your phone will no work anymore? Koreans provided stations and trains with maps. Also the next stations are gonna be announced by woman’s voice. So you can’t miss your station. Besides subway has Wi-Fi, but often this connection could be lost. It’s beneficial to buy T-money card in any convenient store, or in some special machines. It gives discounts during movings between stations and you are able to pay in buses and some taxes. Sometimes metro looked like giant shopping mall, because of having shops to the expensive with cosmetics."
super connections,"great for going across the city, minuses was the metro does not have a day pass which is common for most metros especially for tourists"
Best way to Get around the City,Seoul has very good connectivity of Metro(Subway) throughout the city. But it can be little confusing for foreigners. Don't hesitate to ask your doubts to any local about metro or station.
Easy and convenient ,"Not have a high expectation of Seoul MTR after read some comments on internet. However my personal experience is quite good after took MTR everyday when I was in Seoul.The components are wider and higher than HK MTR trains, seats are much like Japanese trains. As long as you have no problem on walking for a while, it’s still convenient for tourists since the signs are very clear and won’t mislead you even though you maybe not understand Korean.We were staying at Hongdae and took MTR to all the sightseeing and famous tourism places. Only took shuttle to everland and taxi to airport. 在閱讀了一些關於互聯網的評論之後，我們對首爾地鐵沒有很高的期望。然而，事實上我在首爾的每天乘坐地鐵後，我的個人體驗非常好。它的車厢比香港地鐵列車更寬更高，座位很像日本列車。只要你不怕在轉線時需要步行一段時間，對於遊客來說地鐵绝對是方便和經濟的選擇。因為地鐵的標誌非常清楚，即使你可能不懂韓語，也不會誤導你。我們住在弘大，幾乎都是乘坐地鐵到所有觀光和著名的旅遊景點。只是乘坐班車前往愛寶樂園和出租車到機場。"
Confusing... ,"I have been travelled metro many time many different cities and this metro was most confusing me. Metro itself cover most arwa of Seoul and using public transport is always good choice. So, when you plan to visit in Seoul, use metro but take your time to get understand how to get place to place. "
Good metro,"Nothing much to say, it's a really good metro system, clean and on time. I find it really clear and easy to use (compares to others such as Tokyo). I recommend you buy a T-money card and charge it to have a really eas experience"
Great!!!,"I liked it!! It was very nice, not too crowded as I expected, it make a characteristic sound when the train approached ha ha was funny, some train stations have restroom "
Best Way to Reach Places,"Its a best way to reach places in Seoul, very efficient and integrated, simple and easy to understand"
Seoul Metro is the best subway I have ever seen.,"First time I came to Korea, I was amazed with this subway system which is very systematic, right time (never delayed), clean, comfortable and safe to ride. The officer at the station were very nice and kind, they helped me to get to where I needed to go, they helped me to find the way to transit to another subway as well. The ticket machines and the ticket office were also available. The toilet was very clean, the ATM, shops and the seats for waiting next subway were available. They all make me feel very comfortable . I love Seoul Metro."
Easy to use ,"I found the Seoul metro very easy to use. All the signs are in English, the announcement are in English the train is clean and quiet. Korean people fairly polite al though they honor zero personal space. So don’t be surprised when they star d really close or bump into frequently. Recommend downloading KakaoMetro app for assisted trip planning. Pretty accurate. "
Very clean,Great way to get around the city. Signs are in English and so are the announcements so you'll know where you're going. The trains are also really clean
Challenging,The English on maps and brochures are limited. You really need to ask for help at the info desks to make sure you know where to go and on which lines to step over if needed. The people are friendly and willing to help.
Convenient way to travel ,While the size and sheer number of lines can make it confusing it is a good way to travel around Seoul. After buying ticket from machine (in English) you selection your destination and away you go. Remember to get your refund at the end of the trip (assuming you are buying single trip ) I recall there being full day pass if you plan on going to many places during the day. 
Efficient ,"Can be confusing. Ticket machines take coins and small notes. There is usually a note changer machine if you only have big notes. There is an English option. There are also ticket refund machines, you get 500 won refund by returning the ticket. Signs alternate between Korean and English. Express trains don’t stop at every station so watch out for that. "
Essential for Seoul Visit,"You can go anywhere using the subway, there is quite a bit of English, and Chinese and Japanese too. Pay attention to the line numbers and the destinations though, a map is required keep it with you."
Love the efficient mode of transport,"We took taxis for some of our trips around Seoul, but I still prefer the Seoul Metro. Very efficient and some times could be faster than taxis if you factor in the traffic jams. Seats are reasonably comfortable. There are sections where you are expected to give up for the elderly. "
The train is fast but...,"The train is quite fast and time efficient, the only thing is that when it's time where there's a lot of old lady and old guy on board, then thing could be a little bit s*cks. The old ladies will just push you and even won't say sorry when you got hurt because of them (They pushed me until I fell into the platform hole of the train, and no one help me getting up. Lucky I'm fast enough, other I can't imagine what will happen to me >.<), and the old guys are too racist. I'm with a group of Chinese and Japanese friends when one of my Japanese friend suddenly got scolded and hit by the old guy because she speak something in Japanese. Other than that, it's okay..."
Good way to get around,"Highly efficient and reliable with good frequency, the Metro is a cheap and very user friendly way to get around Seoul."
Excellent Hotel,Great location for shopping! Staff was excellent knowledgeable on places to go an see excursions! Executive longe had great food and snacks along with spirts and wine for their guest!
Convenient mode of transportation ,The Seoul Metro is the most convenient mode of transportation in the city. Connections are convenient and you can easily get from one place to another within minutes. It is also a good way to get around to avoid the traffic jams in the city. Price of tickets are fairly reasonable.
Easy to navigate,"Seoul metro is easy to navigate, safe and clean. We took it to and from the airport and all around the city. No need to waste money on a can."
Modern and clean,"We used the metro a lot and had zero problems. Efficient, clean and modern. Crowded only on peak hours."
Efficient transportation system ,"Used Seoul metro for commuting between Incheon airport and Hongnik university metro, Hongik to Eujiro stations - it is clean, efficient , punctual, easy to understand as there are sign boards in English. Many passenger friendly features and amenities are installed on all stations for convenience. "
One of best public transports ever,I've been on a lot of subways on many cities around the world but this one rocks. If you have the metro app on your phone you'll never get lost and the trains run exactly on time.
Love it!!!,"Seoul metro is the most awesome transportation I have ever taken. The design and expertise skills that was brought on to create Seoul Metro is magic!!!! It is one of the best public transportation I have ever taken in my life!!!! It is easy to navigate, and also in English. Every lines connects with each other, and I have to say I can never get lost, using Seoul Metro xoxo!!! Every tourists cannot go missing from using Seoul Metro, or get lost. Just follow the rules and download the Seoul metro app, or use Kakao subway, that is the best app now. Tourists cannot go wrong using Seoul metro, so easy to travel and fare are reasonable price too."
Super Metro,"I absolutely love riding the Seoul metro. It's very convenient, fast, on time and clean. My tip when you're travelling to Korea is download the subway app. It will tell you the departure and arrival of the train, how much the fare is, where the door exit will be and the fastest way to get fo your destination. It has an english version and you can use it everywhere in Korea not just in Seoul."
Adequate but looks dated,Overall it feels very safe and clean; understandably it may look a bit dated as the oldest line opened in 1974. There are altogether 22 lines (including the line to Incheon and Gyeonggi). It is possible to get to Gimpo Airport or Incheon Airport by the metro. The operation hours are from 5.30am to around midnight. Using T Money (a rechargeable transit card) is highly recommended.
I like taking the subs in Seoul.,"The subway system in Korea is efficient. It is easy to understand the whole system with lines and exits. We survived just by using a map. We used Tmoney when taking the subs, it was a much easier choice for us. You can actually use the Tmoney card to pay when you shop in any convenience store (if you have money in your card, of course). I did not appreciate how the locals there push others as getting in the train.. and forcing themselves to get into the train..if the train coach is too packed, meaning there’s no more room, stop pushing others just so you can get in. I’ve encountered this situation too many times. The train is clean, however there’s a funky smell in the train.. im not sure what smell it is, sometimes it’s there.. and sometimes it gets stronger. Some stations do not provide elevators , so it is kind of a challenge for those who travel with huge luggage. Overall , I love how efficient and clean the seoul metro is. "
On it right now...,...for the first time. Really user friendly for a non Korean speaker. All you need is a train map and buying a single journey ticket is easy using the automated machines. The metro makes it real simple for foreigners. I was going to give my review a mark lower because this strange little man came up and stood very close to me where I was sitting. Not sure why as the train is not crowded at all. It isn't fair to judge the whole Metro System on him though. Wait he just got off at the same stop I did...
Super efficient,"Easy to navigate , clean trains , comfortable and efficient service . Frequent services , never too long a wait "
The best transport in Seoul,We buy Tmoney card for subway. We always use subway everyday in Seoul. I think it is the best way and the cheapest transport in Seoul. We can go to many places by subway
Koreans are efficient!,"This was one of the most pleasant experiences I have ever had on public transportation! Riders qued both inside and outside the train so that getting on and off was efficient and orderly. Many of the stops on the maps inside the train we rode had the stop name in English which was helpful. Nonetheless, there were several passengers who helped us understand where to go as well. The website is also quite user-friendly. I advise giving yourself an extra 30 minutes to get to your destination in peak times."
Easy ,The metro was quite easy we ask the hotel before we live.Easy and fast i really enjoyed to see the real life in Seoul but I didn’t take my kids with me at metro
"Clean, efficient and convenient","We used the Seoul Metro from time to time along with buses and taxis. The metro system is very convenient and we usually were able to find a seat on it. Mostly we used the metro within the downtown area, but we did notice that sometimes there were long walks in the subway area to get to our destinations. Something that we really did like is the existence of English speak guides in some of the main stations. These guides are not only found in the subway system but also at most of the attractions around the city."
Amazing transport system,"I found the Seoul's metro very efficient, fast, and clean. The people are polite and riding it is a pleasant experience. It's logic and easy to use."
Yolanda Jones ,Excellent metro on time fairly easy to navigate with stations named in English and announcements on train in 3 languages including English 
easy to get around,"Our apartment wasn't far from the metro. It was easy to navigate, there were ticket machines in both Korean and English. The tickets were also refundable on completion of your journey. The first time we went we got lost deep underground, but once we knew where we were it was great. THE EATING HALL ON THE TOP LEVEL OF THE STATION WAS ALSO WONDERFUL."
Metro,Very efficient and easy and cheap to use. Once you know where you want to visit you just follow the signs to correct line. Can be very busy and don't expect to be able to sit down!
Great transport system ,"The transportation system (metro and busses) is well integrated and the major satnav applications can put together a smooth efficient journey to get you to and from your destination in optimum time and cost. Clean, fast and cheap. Use it!"
Very convenient and best way to move around in Seoul,"Seoul Metro is one of the most cleanest metros I have ever seen. It covers the whole city and you can also use it to go to the outskirts of Seoul. Easy to use with good markings for points to change the train.However, recommend to avoid rush hours as it can get very crowded."
Very reliable,"It may seem complicated when you looked at the map. But with Seoul Metro app, your trip will be easy and comfortable. The metro station will take you anywhere you want to visit. It's very convenient and almost all stations has wide shopping underground!"
One of Worlds Best,"The Seoul Metro is one of the best I have ever seen. Super clean, well organized, easy to follow and ride and here is a tip: people do not talk on the train. So if you need to communicate - whisper!"
Awesome System,"We just spent the holiday weekend in Seoul. We flew into Inchon, rented some WiFi's and jumped on the metro for Myeongdong. It's so easy to navigate Seoul on the Metro. We downloaded the metro app, which is helpful, though I have the metro map in English which is easier for me to see. Anyway, the subway itself is very clean. Remember to check outside of the restroom for toilet paper dispenser. One of the restrooms did not have dispensers in the stalls. Luckily I had a little pouch of tissues in my backpack. The trains are clean and warm as well (it was mostly below 30*F all weekend).I love the fact that the tracks are behind glass for extra safety."
Benefit from subway freerolls of national merit,I went to dongdaemun by subway from city hall front office with my wiwfe.I have benefited from national merit as a vietnam war veteran.the staff in the area really kindly helped us to buy a ticket by pointing us to a ticket purchasing machine. and very cleaning in the subway.
Very organized and easy to use,The Seoul Metro made my stay in Seoul much more pleasant. Plenty of stops and easy to use. Signs all over the place.
Easy to use ,Well sign posted. I bought a ticket from machine (Won 3000) and topped it up by 2000. Directions easy to follow. Signs for destination in English.
Excellent ,"Metro was easy to navigate, clean and seemed safe. Regular service for anywhere you'd need. Great views as you cross the rivers too."
Easy ,Very easy to use. You need to use t money card which you can find every where. If you are a tourist you can buy discover seoul pass and use it also as transportation card.
Very easy to use!,"First, download KakaoMetro and Google Translate. KakaoMetro will tell you which subways to catch and the times they arrive, and Google Translate will help when things are not in your language. Use the ‘Camera’ to take a picture of something written and it will translate for you, or ‘Voice’ and talk into your phone to have it translate and then show your phone to someone."
Metro is very good,Very good easy to use. Cheap way of getting around city. lot of attendants speak english and can help work out how to get around. 
Very advanced transportation,"Excellent train infrastructure and service. Probably easier to look up Google maps and will show you which train, train lines and exit to use. Economic and fess free travel. Be sure to look up which exit to take otherwise it is quite a distance from one exit to another. Highly recommended "
very standard,"I still see so many people who don't care about taking chairs for pregnant women, the elderly and those with special needs"
"Efficient, Reliable","Spent most of the time traveling between tourist locations by Seoul Metro.Simple to understand, simple to use and best of all very cost effective.On December 31st we travelled from Insadong to the Coex Mall In Gangnam to bring in the New Year. At 10:00 pm at night taking the Metro was a breeze.Highly recommended."
Avoid it on Friday nights,"It’s definitely one of the cleanest transport, it’s much more better and more convenient than Singapore’s imo. But avoid using it during Friday nights, especially if you’re traveling in the Seoul area. Friday nights are famous with its term 불금 lit. transl hot friday). It’s that time when people are meeting with friends after works/school, going out with their bf/gf, having drinks and hanging out And staying out late, so you will most definitely find the subway to be the most crowded at this time. "
Very easy to use ,"Use it, because when in Rome... Very simple and budget friendly. Just to warn you, sometimes strong smell of kimchi inside :) "
Always on time,"It's clean and the trains are almost always on time, we did not have any problems finding our destinations."
so easy,Possibly the easiest metro ever. Get a T money card for 500won load it in the english machines.... Then off you go! 
Easy to use,Found the subway easy to use and the terminals are in english. They are fast and very well located to key locations if you are a visitor
Great subway,"Great subway. I debated about getting a T money card, however as I was only in Seoul for 1 ½ days I just bought tickets as needed. It was so easy using the ticket machines. Just select where you are going, how many tickets and insert your cash and there is your ticket. There were machines for refunding your 500 won ticket deposit after your trip. Signage and announcements in English made it very easy to get around."
Need to be more extensive ,"The Seoul Metro is definitely a great way to travel around Seoul. The issue I have is, most destinations require transit by bus or it’s just a long walk to the metro stations. Perhaps the network needs to be more extensive? "
Easy to use.,"You can reach just about everywhere by subway, although you may have to change lines once or twice. Make sure you have a subway map. The trains flash up the name of each, and the next, station, in English, but only briefly and if the train is crowded it can be difficult to see the screen. There were toilets at all the stations I visited and they were spotlessly clean."
Notmal,"Transport is Normal as usual , I preferred the Hong Kong one more. Remember downwind an app for teaching you how to get up and get off of station "
Efficient and Clean,"Terrific subway system (similar to Tokyo) which took us everywhere we wanted to go around Seoul. System is easy to use, runs often and is clean. Ticket machines and metro signs are in english and most rides are under $2.00. You can buy a trip ticket which will require getting a 500 won refund after each trip (for the ticket stub). Otherwise you can use the T-money card (purchased at convenience stores) which you can load up with won in advance. You can use the t-money card to make purchases at convenience stores and on buses too. If riding on metro (with t-money card) you can transfer to a bus with no fee if used within one hour. However card costs 3000 won non-refundable but will give you a discount of 100 won per trip. "
Very Efficient subway system,"Honestly, for the most part Seoul subway lines are one of the easiest to find your way around because of the English signs that are well marked and pain free throughout the system. Most fares are the same price and transfers to other subway lines and buses are generally free unless you are traveling a long distance i.e. maybe add 200 won to your trip. Majortity of time, use Kakao metro app and use final destination/stop as a guide meaning if it goes to end of that line then it will stop at your stop along the way. Nice, that I haven't experienced an off loading because the subway train broke down like other systems worldwide. Only cons are sometimes transfers in some stations take 7-10 minutes to walk to other lines. Also, the older the line the less modern it is so line 6 and up are the better and cleaner. But, yeah mind the gap and you all good .Airport line is great if you are flying in to Incheon airport because for 7-8000 won - it will get you into Seoul under an hour. Keep in mind avoid rush hours because you will feel like a sardine and there is no such thing as personal space here. Cheers. "
Download the app to truly enjoy the convenience,"There is no way you can make sense of the metro system without the city app, so download it to really benefit from the ease, comfort of the public transit. Just stay clear of the designated seats if you do not qualify for one and be watchful of the evening traffic of inebriated commuters who tend to spew orange when they feel ill. Otherwise, in the depth of winter, the heated seats are a great way to warm up you toosh!"
A much more modern and convenient means of subway transportation compared to other countries,"You can really understand where to go when looking at the metro map inside the station and inside the train, the bright colours to indicate lines are really pleasing, line interchanges are convenient, also those gates that prevent people from falling on to tracks are real nice and cool, my country(Australia) subway system, stations, and trains really sucks compared to yours."
"Smooth, comprehensive, easy",Seoul Metro has a well established network and metro system. Easy to use. Comparable to Tokyo Metro. The only difference with Tokyo Metro is that Japanese commuters do not make noise in the carriage.
Get the T Money Card,"T Money Card is $4 to buy then you top up with money from connivence store. Rides are cheap and you can also get from the airport to major areas. Once you read the signs and they are in English too, you will get used to it, the only issues is which exit to come out of once your at the station. "
Good public transportation,"It's easy access, fast, comfortable and convenient. There's a public transportation card exclusively for international visitors, MPASS can be used to take up to 20 city bus and subway rides in April and the surrounding areas."
Very well connected and informative,"Being complete outsiders in the city, we had no idea about getting around but each metro station was very informative and the help gates very useful when we needed help. A lot of it is digitized unlike in many other metro cities. "
Winter Metro in Seoul,"Very convenient, user friendly, not complicated.Recommended for free and easy travellers. T-Card is a must for Seoul."
convenient,"metro in seoul is really convenient, one can get to many attractions just outside the metro station!!"
Family trip in Seoul on Christmas 2018,It was really efficient & convenient since one pass can be used in all lines. It made our travel hassle free! 
Transportation,"Easy to use, very well covered, accessibility is ample and simple to use. Inexpensive as compared to many countries."
"Clean, safe, and always on time","I've traveled to multiple metropolitan areas in the past decade (London, New York, Los Angeles, Beijing, Shanghai, Paris, and Moscow) and none of them have lived up to the quality and ease of use of the Seoul subway system. The subway cars are new, clean, and easy to navigate, and I've never felt unsafe using the subway even at 2AM. I've heard good things about the Tokyo subway, and I'll have to see if its comparable to Seoul's when I visit,"
Very Convenient and Cheap,The metro gets you to many places in Seoul and is very reasonably priced. Make sure to have cash for the fares.
Convenient to move around,"The trains are clean and easy to use if you do some planning ahead. Unfortunately, when we purchase or Tourist Card, it didn't give us back any change and there was no staff around to help us."
Convenient and easy to use,The metro system is very extensive and easy to use. There are multiple exits at each stop. It is clean and feels safe. 
"don't panic when you enter the wrong track, push the green button, no need to exit and re-enter buying new tickets!","Seoul metro is a quite different, indeed. I travelled with my mom (on wheel chair). The metro was wheel chair friendly, elevators were available. Once, it happened that we went to the wrong track and needed to go to the other platform but first we had to exit and re-entered (we did this once, what a cost). But a friendly Korean lady explained to us that we didn't need to do that. At the metro gate, just push the green button (usually placed on the wheel chair entrance), and the metro staff would come. You just to explain that you need to change track, she/he would assist you and you don't have to but any ticket anymore."
Great way to travel,The metro system is a great way to travel within Seoul. It’s easy and the staff there are very happy to answer your queries for directions. 
Best transportation system around!,"So simple to use, fun to run around South Korea in! You can go wherever you want using the Seoul Metro system. "
Efficient and easy to use,"Get a T card to have discounted travel. You have to pay for the T card and load value so you will only find value if you use the card a few times on your trip (discounts only apply to adults so did children is best is just buy single-use tix). The metro is clean and efficient. Though crowded, patrons are orderly and generally polite. There are generally announcements in both Korea and English but is best to be clear on which stops you want first in case. Overall we found it easy to get around. "
Riding the subway,Really simple!They have machines that help you with a temporary ticket or you can go to a convenience shop to grab a Tmoney card for longer periods. The app KakaoMetro is the best! Tracking stop by stop and transfers. I love it! They have KakaoMap also to help as well as chat for messages.
Not stroller friendly,"Too many stairs, less lift, stroller is blocked in escalator.. so hard to get up and down if you bring stroller with kids.. "
Lots of stairs ,The best exercise place is the walking in the metro and now I know why Korean girls legs are so slim.
Efficient route network. ,"The route network covers most areas in Seoul. However, the frequency during peak hours was not ideal. Fare prices reasonable. One setback, some older folks are rude and will simply push their way out when it was crowded. Not even a word of apology or ' excuse me'. Very unfiltered ppl. Overall it's a good and efficient transportation. "
Easy to use and best way to get around in Seoul. ,"Download the subway app online and it is easy to get around all the various attractions in Seoul. Easy to use, convenient. Clean n efficient. Best way to get around seoul! "
Efficient,"Easy to use, clean, safe and fast.Cards sometimes dont work but you can use the special gate in that case.Difficult for tourists to find the right exit."
The most easy,This a wonderful transportation easy fast you will not wait long from one to next the stations has small market if you need to buy express things if you remain balance in your T money card before fly back be sure that you can refund the amount from the station itself either from the machine or from the office itself I was using CU+and I refund my balance very easy 
Subway Experience,"I guess those of you who have lived in cities with subway systems, this is old hat to you, but for me it was a bit intimidating at first. They try to help with numbering the different lines and even color coding them on their maps. They run frequently so there is no worry if you miss one or get off at the wrong stop, like I did a couple of times. But toward the end of my stay in Seoul, I noticed that along with the numbering and color codings, the stops all have 3 digits and the first digit always refers to the line number. Daaaaaa. I guess I just became a genius...lol. Anyway, it was an experience but I felt that the subway system in Hong Kong was easier to use and far less scary. Probably it was because Hong Kong's is smaller. Have fun travelers!"
يفي بالغرض,"هو اسرع وسيلة تنقل موجودة .. لكن عيبة الروائح النفاثة من الافل ارتداء الكمامات قبل الركوب.The fastest way to move, yet! It’s so smelly :( you have to wear mask before you get in"
Great metro system ,Extensive connections. Easy to move from place to place including airport. Recommend to get single trip ticket if no plans to travel extensively. We bought t-money card and realised that the cards are not refundable. 
Great Metro with Local friendly,"i came to work by this metro for 5 months and all enjoyed my times here . It is very nice , safe and on time . it is also very easy for use even you do not speak korean and the cost is very cheap . highly recommend to explore the city by use this metro"
Unbelievable,"Seoul Metro, from anywhere to anywhere! So easy in English to korean! I visited for a month! never took a taxi or a bus, only the subway! everywhere! and not expensive at all. Fast and clean, from the Airport in Seoul all the way to the hotel basement! And I always got to seat, because the younger people would get up and let me "" old person"" seat down. but don't sit in the pink seats they seems to be for ladies with babies, It was easy to buy the tickets and I soon found out the used tickets you put back into the machines and get some money back. Maps for the metro are everywhere and in both korean and english, easy to read! I can't wait to go back and ride the metro in Seoul and everywhere, Thank you Seoul Metro"
"Inexpensive, safe but allow enough time","The metro is clean, safe and cheap. Its a convenient way to go around Seoul but not most friendliest metros for visitors who don't speak Korean. The signs are usually in Korean and in English, but the English signs are very small and hard to notice in some places and in some places they don't exist. I always had to double check, check the map or app all the time. The Kakao Metro app was very useful and easy to use, and the token vending machine was also very easy to use.Traveling from one place to another place often required 2-3 line changes,and each time had to wait about 3-5 min. It took me about 45 min or so to travel from distance to another."
Easy to use and safe,"As a former New Yorker it is always fun to try a subway in another city and see how it operates. The Seoul Metro is easy to use, to figure out and get around. Try it and see. Better than driving!"
Easy to understand with app,You can download an app which is useful to plan your travel. Convenient way to go around Seoul. You can purchase a single trip tickets or top up for multiple journey.
"Maybe not the top attraction, but a great way of getting there....","The Seoul Metro is a very nice, convenient and inexpensive way to get essentially anywhere in Seoul; as a native english speaker I found it very easy to navigate and have used it heavily during the several trips I have made to Seoul through the years. The cars are wide and the seats are comfortable, if you can get one (but don't count on it!). I don;t know if I would say it is the top attraction in the city, but it is a great way to get to just about anyplace in the city you'd like to go."
Fabulous Metro ,Easy to use even without reading or speaking Korean. Clean on time trains.Stations have shops food and bathrooms.Get the Seoul metro app and it will tell you times and also bus connections.
The metro is recommended for travelling around Seoul,"The metro in Seoul is well connected, and can almost get you to various places of interests, either on the metro network or together with the equally efficient bus network.During winter, the seats are heated and that is well appreciated in the freezing cold. The trains are generally very clean, but they do get very crowded during rush hours and on popular routes. One down side is that the stations are mostly stairs, with an elevator at the far end or maybe an escalator. Also at some stations, if you go to the wrong platform (ie. opposite direction), it is a challenge getting to the correct one. Nonetheless, the metro is recommended for travelling around Seoul - get make sure you buy a store-value card which is available from the ticketing machines at the stations. Do also download KakaoMap to help you in your search of train routes. "
Easy Usage but...,"Overall, my experience in this was good, but except for the fact that it was so compact that I couldn't even bare to sit for even a second. If anyone is in a hurry and does not care about cleanness and comfort, please go ahead and use. If anyone is troubled by this, there are other ways of getting by, but this may be the cheapest way to get through the day."
Easy to use and so cheap,"It's amazing , on time, fast, reliable and safe and cheap.. makes the london underground feel like a third world train system in comparison"
Tough for a foreigner,"This isn't a Metro as much as a subway on train tracks. The stations are signed poorly, and overall navigation hard between the lines. ONE HUGE TIP: Download the app Subway Korea. Once we downloaded that, the confusion was greatly minimized, although finding the right line still presented itself a challenge."
Clean,"Very convenient super clean and people are respectu, only problem is old people heehehehe but it’s normal m guess"
Review as a korean,"It is the best metro i have ever experienced. For reference, i experienced metro from more than 10 country. Even though i am a local people in seoul, i feel excited when i hear the BGM of transfer station."
metro extremely efficient,"we travelled by bus and subway, mostly by bus and all was amazing. They have bus lanes which makes travel quick even at rush hour."
Station Announcements,"The Seoul Metro has a very distinct and recognizable chime when trains pull in to the stations. That, coupled with the station name announcements on the trains, will stick in your head for days after you've left the country. Guaranteed! "
The easy way to get about Seoul,"Seoul metro is brilliant & so easy to use to get around Seoul to any of the attractions or areas you want to visit. Plus, they have loads of shops on the underground selling EVERYTHING you can imagine!"
Courteous Koreans,Koreans are generally very polite and courteous. A lady offered me a seat while I was travelling in a metro. Some folks even offered my young daughter sweets while touring Seoul.
Easy to navigate,"Efficient, on-time and english instructions throughout for easy navigation. Only downside is that the staff are not very helpful."
"so easy, safe and cheap","It is absolutely the way to get around in Seoul...although taxis are fairly cheap, this was a great option."
You can go anywhere in Seoul by metros,"The fastest, easiest, safest way to enjoy Seoul. The metro system goes anywhere in Seoul. But, you'd better avoid the rush hours when it is very crowded."
Seoul Metro,"Taking Seoul Metro subway system is one of the best way to enjoy Seoul. First of all, it's convenient and time-saving. You can get to almost tour site on time. Second of aĺl, it's the lowest fare among many transportation system. You can transfer several times without extra fare, in case within limited transfer time allowance, say 2-3 hours. Furthermore, you can transfer metro to bus by just scanning. Lastly, Seoul metro is the easiest way to find your destination. All of the metro stations are clearly introduced in english. Hope you guys enjoy your trip in Seoul!"
Len & Marlene,The subway is one of the most extensive and reasonable that I have ever seen anywhere in the world. The subway is clean and very well sign posted even for those of us who don’t speak Korean.
"Excellent, cheap and gets you everywhere",Get a T money card and load 10 000 Won - that will give you 8 rides as each trip in Seoul is deducted at 1250 per trip upon entry. Fast and easy to navigate and so easy to change tracks to any location u want to go to
"safe, fast, clean and cheap",perfect alternative to the taxi on crowded roads. So take your time and enjoy an easy travel through Seoul
Easy for foreigners to navigate,"System can take you everywhere you need to go, it is clean and easy to figure out. All the maps and signs are in Korean and English "
easiest way to travel!,"I never rode a subway before, but they have an app that helps you find the route you need. It also can work offline. The subways were always on time."
Confused but very prompt,The subway metro line is quite confusing and a lot of walking for transfer of line. However the service is quite prompt and comfortable. 
Crammed with people and no AC. Not for the claustrophobic!,"They do not provide AC or cooler temperatures like the subways in HK and Taiwan does. People push you very hard during rush hour trains and your stuck with nowhere to go. I had a panick attack while being pushed in the train and having pretty much no space and air to breathe... I honestly felt I was going to suffocate to death, I very much dislike Seoul Metro and decided after that to take Taxi whereever I go. Never taking Seoul Metro again!!!"
Great,"Seoul metro is the most convenient way to get to places you want in Seoul, since there is so much traffic in Seoul. Metro is the fast way too, but people can be rude stepping on your feet and pushing during rush hours and they might not even apologize."
Seoul Metro,"The coming of trains is signalled by a music playing. This ensures that passengers will definitely know the coming of train. Plush seats. Different lengths of hand grabs for diffferent heights of people. Overall, it’s an efficient mode of transport around the country. Numbering of lines are simple from 1 - 9. Announcements are made in both korean and English."
Well connected,"Very convenient. There are stops at most major places. The metros are well connected so transiting between stations is not a problem at all. Announcements are in Korean, Japanese, English and Mandarin. Only thing is some stations might not have escalators/ lift so if you are travelling with big luggage, you might want to plan your route properly. "
Korean Holiday,"The Seoul Metropolitan Subway is a metropolitan railway system consisting of 22 rapid transit, light metro, commuter rail and people mover lines located in northwest South Korea. The system serves most of the Seoul Metropolitan Area including the Incheon metropolis and satellite cities in Gyeonggi province. "
Very easy to follow!,"Just input station where you want to go to. (Use google maps or Rome2Rio for directions.) then machine will ask for how many person then after which card, change and receipt will be printed. The latter, if requested."
100% Wheelchair Friendly,"Seoul has made accessible even the deepest tubes in its subway system. I rode the steepest and longest stairglides I have ever seen the likes of which made me dizzy but got me on my way nonetheless. A plus: the attendants are efficient and friendly with help and directions.My day pass (pictured here) cost me 12,000 and it was suggested to me by the attendant at the counter after I gave up at the automatic dispensers. "
Prepare for lots of staircase nightmare!,"They just don't want to build the lift or escalator all the way! Some escalator can stop at the middle and you have to climb. It's very inconvenience if you bring a stroller or handicap with wheelchair. Myeongdong station is a good example. With a baby stroller, prepare to climb at least two staircase. Some subway line with same colour will slip into two location. The captain will only report in Korean! Very bad experience when we try subway to Onyangoncheon Station! Lesson learned is to take KTX! Other then that, subway is clean! Convenience, on time, not expensive and you can eat some snack or drink! "
"Efficient, clean, affordable.","We spent a month in Seoul and only used a taxi on a late night out when the metro was not running (3 am or so). It is much wider than Those in European cities so even in peak hours there is room to enter and leave, albeit crowded as expected in such a big city.Save some money and ride like the locals!"
Very Efficient,"Everything is color coded and typically romanized on the signs. It’s also one of the cheap ways to get around. Tip: stop in a convenience store and get yourself a T-Money card. Ask the clerk to charge it up with 10000 or so TWD. What we you don’t use, you can get refunded at the airport. Plus, you can use the card to pay at most restaurants. It’s kind of like a credit card. Use it for the bus or cabs too. You’ll have to charge the card up using cash, but at least you have a sort of prepaid transportation credit card in hand."
Super convenient!,"Easily, one of the most convenient subways in Asia! There are underground markets and shops and ample English signages to help foreigners. "
"great network interconnecting various location, but bad for older people","The subway from airports are fast and comfy, all the way to the heart of seoul and you can change trains to various location easily. But navigating may be a bit of a hassle. The main complain abou the subway is, there are very little escalator which helps you and your heavy luggage, or older people with weak knees, or handicap with leg problem. Even the most popular myeong dong area where people buy kilos of stuff and carry in luggage needs to lug it up and down stairs and is tiring.Cost of travelling within 5 km is around USD 1.25 each trip, buying their store value card if you are there for more than 5 days will be worth it, kids with child cards gets to travel cheaper.At the end of your trip, just go to any convenience store and get refund for your cards, but you loose deposit money."
Easy to use,Pick up a simple map at the airport and also a full map and then go off both of them. The simple map is the easiest to see routes that you need and the full map shows you all the things in between the stops. The simple map is not draw to scale or even along the actual route path so you can’t go off it for planning your sightseeing. ONLY use the simple map for reminding of where the on off or transfer is. Also the phonetic English spelling is different compared to each map and the posted signs and the maps on the subway walls. But each station name is the same throughout. So you have to check the Korean characters to make sure it’s the same one that you want. It Really isn’t too difficult to navigate at all. 
Very easy to navigate,The buses are very easy to navigate. Especially with an app like CityMapper. Stops are announced in English. Buses are clean and not crowded. 
Reliable ,"You will never be late because of the subway in Korea, that’s for sure. Easy to find everything as well."
Seoul Metro,"Puts the NYC subways to shame. It is on time, clean, quiet and has an app you can download that tells you where you go, how long it will take, the fare, what side of the train the doors open on and which exit stairs go where."
"Cheap, Convenient, Comfortable and Great Connectivity","It was amazingly cheap for us to commute from place to place on the metro trains. Destinations, in English, are sometimes announced, but always indicated on digital boards. It's very convenient with the Korea Travel Card which is a debit card. Trains are fast, clean and punctual, and take you near enough to all tourist sites."
Super efficient and quite english friendly too surprisingly,"Quite simple to use along with naver maps and i tried using single destination tickets and as others have mentioned here, it might be better to use the T money card."
Convenient and well organized ,Metro system in Seoul is easy to comprehend and vey convenient. Just make sure you get Tmoney card as this will save you time and hassle. 
Can be more Friendly to Silver Folks & Tourists,"An excellent metro system with large number of stations, clean, short wait-time and being orderly used by commuters.Too much stairs to climb for old folks.Inadequate information for 1st time non-Korean speaking visitors to quickly get familiar with the use of the system. "
EASY TO USE!!,LOVED using the metro in Seoul! It's quite easy AND cheap to get around town and to the most visited areas of the city!
Easy to get around,"Most stations don’t have ticket offices but you can buy a travel card from the machine in any station and top this up to travel anywhere on the transport system in Seoul. (It comes with a handy map of the Seoul system.) The metro system is easy to understand and navigate with signs and announcements in Korean, English and Mandarin. The card can be used for purchases and topped up in 7 Eleven and other convenience stores.You can also use the same card in other parts of Korea. We used it on the buses, including the airport shuttle, on Jeju Island. "
Vacation,"Express train comfortable seats, very easy to navigate, and quicker than bus or taxi and scenery is wonderful."
Super Fast,"Want to make the most of your trip in Seoul, learn the Metro. Visitors can pick up a special foreigners T-card at the airport on arrival. It costs 4000 won (about $4) and you can load it there. This will allow you to travel on the Metro as well as buses and some cabs. The service is super fast in terms of travel time and we never had to wait more then 10 minutes for the next train to arrive. The stations are super clean but can get a bit confusing. Be sure to look at the top of the entrance door, you will see the name of the previous station, your station and the next station with a small arrow telling you the direction. Each trip we took was under 2000 won per person so totally worth it. You have to scan going in and going out, be sure to do that so you don't get charge for a full trip to the end of the line. Most stations do have elevators, but not really easy to find so be prepared for a lot of steps to use. "
Always take a metro trip,Part of the Seoul experience. So quiet and the people are kind even though they keep to themselves. We got off at Dongguk University stop on Line 6 and strolled into a lovely park! 
bewildering,we got lost in the metro - entered the wrong direction and had to ask for assistance to be let out. Another thing is underground connections not straight forward. Some involve lots of walking and staircases between lines 
Clean and efficient,Runs on time is spacious has air con is big is clean... what else do you want. In fact I want it in London! Shame on the London tube!!!!!!!!
Easy Ride,"Got to love accessible, clean, easy to understand and transfer system. Avoid the work commuters hours for a relaxed ride. Some stations have a long walk to transfer to another line. WiFi is available system wide. Handicapped accessible."
Okay I may be biased...,"Sorry for those reading this, as I may be biased towards the efficiency of Tokyo metro. Just a few things I’d say on the issues I had: there are almost never anybody at any stations if u needed to ask for help. There are no signs or indication with the next trains arrival time asides from the printed timetable and this screen that has a picture of the train showing you where it’s currently at (so you have an idea of maybe when it’s may arrive, but no time indications). The tracks for the same line but going opposite directions can be somewhat confusing when you enter the gates as they would both say they go towards those stations until u try to figure it out going down to the platforms. Maybe we just had issues with the inner and outer circle line 2 the most lol. The good thing about it is it’s only one fare no matter where you go, so that’s an upside. So in general it’s good, but I would’ve expected more for Seoul. "
The best Metro System,Simply an amazingly well run and efficient underground system. Its easy to use and has English translations on the maps plus on the train it also has English speaking information.Very very clean and even though it can be very busy people queue in an orderly manner.The trains run regularly but note the last train is at midnight.All of the stations have places to eat and some even have shopping centres inside.Plus there are toilets everywhere.You can buy a travel card at the airport and the cost of travel is not expensive
Conveniently,"Very informative, convenient subway. The stops are announced both Korean and English. Infirmation desk is also in Korean and English."
Use of metro,Metro is easy and clear to use. The people are extremely helpful and are never in a hurry not to help you.
"Convenient, Accessible","Well connected, super convenient and Easy to commute. Well announced making it the preferred mode of transportation for foreigners"
Lots of colorful lines. Buy a T-money card for ease of use,"Firstly, get the T-money card from any of the convenience shop/ airport and top up. You can easily top up at the machine at every station, just change the language to English. It is easy to do the top up. Don't try to figure out the fares, only you will not get through the gate if there is not enough credit. Don't panic, just press the help button at the gate. Someone will come out to help. "
Easy and cheap,"The Seoul metro system is easy and cheap for getting around the city. Please make sure to get a T-money card from the metro ticket machine at the airport, which you can use for all public transport and taxi. The metro displays and announces in 4 language including Korean, English, Mandarin and Japanese. With clean and wide space coaches train. The only down turn is that you need to adopt to their culture as they don’t express excuse me but pushing people away if the need to pass you."
The best transport there ever was,"I cannot even begin to depict how efficient, cheap, and easy the Seoul Metro is. It may be a bit intimidating at first when you look at a map of how many metro lines there actually are, but don't let that deter you from taking it! And fret not if you don't know Korean, each station is also written and announced in English, so you won't get lost."
1st time use Seoul metro,"I have visited Seoul many times previously but have always used either hire cars or taxis to move around Sth Korea"". But we decided to HSE the Selul Metro as it beats the oeAk hour traffic if Seoul. We caught a metro train lon line 2 from station 212(hospital) to 216 alas the river near Lotte WorldFrom getting tickets from the vending machine to following the easily distinguishing sign posts we found the right platform and sideWaiting time minimal and comfort if boarding and alighting metro train easy. At our getting off station we placed our ticket in a vending machine and received a refund if our unused portion of ticket - pretty good eh"
Great network,Definitely top 5 subway/metro system in the world. Theres no place that you can’t reach on it in Seoul.
Easy transport,"The Metro is a very cheap and convenient way to move around Seoul. It is easy the understand the maps, and people always came up to us and made sure we knew where we were going - very friendly and helpful. "
Convenient and fast,"This is a very convenient, fast and cheaper way to go around South Korea.Elevators and escalators are available in most stops. There were designated areas for those with strollers / wheelchairs / luggages.Like many new places, navigating takes some getting used to. But there are train navigation apps that can be used to make it easier. You get the hang of it after a day or two of going around."
Convenient & Direction is Clear,"This is the 2nd time we visited Seoul. Seoul Metro is very convenient as it reaches many places. Frequency of train is good, direction is clear, stations are clean & tidy.It has clear English announcement to tell the name of next station and what lines of trains can be transferred.Nevertheless it’s not every train has English name or number of station shown, sometimes neither on route map in compartment nor screen (old train doesn’t have screen) thus you have to pay attention to listen what station it will be > <"
Metro,Seoul metro is exceptionaly good. In my experiance the metros are on time there are 2 types normal and express the normal metro stops at all stops the express at main stops. The cars are clean and comfortable but can get very busy during rush hours. Geting tickets is very easy with the machines in the station. Best way to travel around Seoul.
Very easy to get around,"Easy to use with T Money card, always felt very safe and an inexpensive way to see all of Seoul. The only tricky part is working out which exit to take!"
Easy to figure out,Seoul metro is easy to use and a wonderful way to travel considering that if you attempt to drive you will have serious issues! 
"Efficient, clean and very well signed","Expansive network, very well signed to know where to go (better than European metro signage). Tricky if you use a single journey ticket as nothing (map or otherwise) shows you what trips incur a higher cost and you may be trapped before you exit the train as the basic single journey may not be enough. If you get the T-card, you won't have this problem. I still used single journey cards since I prefer lots of walking. But I did figure out that I could buy a single journey card specifying my destination station so up front I would pay the exact fare and avoid being trapped (took only two times before I investigated how to avoid a third..). Clean cars. Can get crowded. "
Easy To Use,"We only has a day in Korea but used the metro from the airport into town its a 1.5 hour journey but its clean and is so much bigger than the Lonond tube system so no problems with baggage. We bought 2 single tickets from the airport to Dongdaemun stion for 9500 but you ger 500 back from each ticket if you pop your tickets in the recycle machine at the end of your journey as they are plastic. The limosine bus takes aprox the same time but is 10,000 each. Be prepared to walk a long time underground to get to conecting lines otherwise a great service "
Superconvenient,"You have to walk a lot when transferring to another line. Trains can be overcrowded. They use also numbers for the station, although I never found a plan where I could find the numberstation."
Easy to navigate if you look for the clues,"Study a map to see where you need to go and even if you cannot read Korean there are some clues that you should look for.Each line has a different colour and line number. Each station has a number so when you are going from one stop to another look for the station numbers they are located on the station signs and also on the sliding door so that you can see them when standing in the train before the doors open.When transiting from one line to another, look for the transit signs to the various colour lines and there are also brass plaques in the floor pointing the way,It is advisabe to take a photo of the station name so that you can show locals if you need directions back to that location and t is helpful to look at an App to see which exit you need to use. These are all numbered and easy to locate form the signs in the stations or underground tunnels. "
"Wonderful, but overcrowding","This is a really good transportation system. Very efficient.But I need more space to sit, even to stand. Too many people are using this, and it is overcrowded. During rush hours, it is worse. I had to take this every day when I went to Korea for 1 month. I always felt sick. Seriously, too many people. If you are a person who hates overcrowded space very much, I do not recommend you to ride this :( At least, not during the rush hours. By the way, in Korea, people call overcrowded subway ""Hell-way "" lol. The point is transportation awesome, but need more space yes."
Best way to get around Seoul!,"I relied on the Seoul Metro daily while visiting. There are subway entrances and exits throughout Seoul, and purchasing tickets were simple even for us tourists. The metro was always on time, clean, and efficient. Try to avoid rush hour if you can, it can get packed! The map for the metro was easy to get used to, once you get the schedule down, you can get around anywhere within Seoul."
"clean, light, safe","the subway is the most wonderful means of transportation in Korea, as there are no traffic jams, light, clean, safe, buy a T-money card and ride, even all day. Only the T-money is necessary not to forget to reload. Under the ground right entire cities, space and light. Even sometimes you forget that you are underground. Take at least the transition from the subway to Lotte tower and Lotte World, fantastic!"
Probably one of the best in the world,"The South Korean Public Transportation system is by far one of the best in the world. -On Time-Efficient-CheapEven if you are a foreigner coming from a developing nation, the public transport prices are highly affordable. The downside is that SOME stations are not mentioned in English. You would need to download Naver-for iOS and Android (the South Korean version of Google Maps) to get around as Google Maps does not work everywhere and when it does it shows only information about public transport but not the walking and driving routes. There is an alternate app for foreigners called CityMapper but it's not very accurate. I've seen most tourists (not foreigners- foreigners settled in SK use Naver) use City mapper because it can be used in other countries as well and also because most places are mentioned in English. I've used CityMapper most of the time as it's interface is very easy to navigate and understand. But it's not very accurate. My Korean friends do not recommend City Mapper. So in my 1 month stay in Korea, it was towards the last week that I was more comfortable with Naver.If you want to save a ton of money, use the Metro & Bus. You'll save a lot of money which you can use for Shopping and food."
Easy to use,The Seoul metro is easy to use and does not cost much. Station names are in Korean and English and they call the stations in both languages. The stations and trains are very clean. Many stations have shops and places of interest.
Easy to navigate,We are a middle aged couple and travelled a fair bit on the subway.With a good subway map and planning where to go the system is easy to navigate. The ticket machines are easy to operate and signs in English so with a bit of patience everything works well.
Very efficient ,"Very efficient, easy to use and affordable. The metro is spacious and clean. Easy to understand what lines you need to take."
Easy to commute,"Easy to commute between places. I would advise not to get the travel card which will cost 4,000won (non-refundable) if you’re only using the metro for 2-3 days. Just buy the ticket at the station."
Excellent service,We experienced a lot of metro in different countries all around the world and this was among the best. Very clean and always on time. Very useful to go around this big city
"clean , efficient , cheap metro",the seoul metro is a great and the best way around town !! ride costs around 1350 kw which is about 1.20$ . it is divided into numbered lines with different colors. you buy ticket from machines that are in korean and english. they announce the stations in korean and english so it is well organized and easy to use. the stations are big with many exits .i was very imoressed how immaculately clean the cars and the stations are !
Very convenient,"It is one of the best way to get around Seoul city. There are chances where you might be confused with certain stations for tourists, especially if you are a foreigner. We had to get that single entry cad where you hace to make a 500 won deposit on top of tri[ fare but you could get the deposit back once you come out from the station"
Cheap & Easy to navigate,Navigating through Seoul is easy with the color coded train lines and buying tickets was also super easy via the machines that sell tickets in multiple languages. 
Seoul Metro,As a foreign traveller you will find the metro easy to navigate. Just remember that you will need to get cash from an ATM before acquiring a ticket as the machine only take cash for the Metro at the Airport.
Clean and fast,"Seoul has, arguably, the world's best metro network. It covers the entire city like a giant spider web and you are never too far from a station. The trains arrive frequently, tickets are cheap and, bring underground, you avoid the traffic jams. The carriages are spacious and air conditioned, while the stations are clean and brightly lit."
What's not to like about the Seoul Metro?,"It's clean, efficient, cheap and covers most of the city. All the maps include station names in English and all station exits are numbered which makes it easy to work out which exit to take. Highly recommend using the subway to get around Seoul and avoid traffic."
Awesome mode of transport,"Best way to get around Seoul and avoid the traffic. very well connected, just remember to download the map before making a trip. Getting a prepaid card is the easier way to travel and avoid buying single travel tickets on every trip."
I loved it!!,On the beginig I didnt really understood why this activity is the best think to do in Seoul...but after few hours I just loved it. It is extremly well organizated and this jingles....I still listen them even if I am back to Europe
Good subway connection.,South Korea have a very reliable subway system.You can use the subway to many tourist destinations.Some of the subway stations are connected to underground shopping area and this is a plus points.
Seoul Metro was very user friendly,Wherever I travel I like to experience the local metro. The Seoul metro was super easy to navigate. The ticket machines are in multiple languages and selecting the from/to stops to purchase a tickets was a breeze. The cars are very clear and run efficiently.
Metro Station in Seoul is very efficient!,"Being a tourist, metro station is giving us a hard time because we need to be familiarize every one of it. But Seoul Metro give us the easiest and fastest way to be in our next target place."
Airport Railroad,"The Seoul metro has introduced the Seoul airport railroad from Incheon airport to Seoul station. Unlike the airport express train, it stops on all station. If you are not in a hurry, this is a cheaper way to reach the city centre. It is Won 4500 per person and the journey takes an hour. The express train is Won 8500 per person and takes 43 minutes. The Seoul metro is well developed with an extensive web of lines that cover most of the tourists spots. The numbering system for each destination helps a lot for tourists like me who do not know the Korean language. It will be more user friendly if the metro has more elevators and escalators to facitate the senior travelers."
Excellent cleanliness,"There were a lot of food stall in a few station but amazingly the area was clean during my journey in using the metro. Easily download naver and korean Subway and together they provides a good direction for our journey. Maybe it will be better if they provide more direction for elevator access. Because it eas strictly prohibited to use the escalator with a stroller and sometimes there were only stairs or maybe we just couldnt find the elevator. Some of the line were really crowded at certain times, but sometimes we found it empty."
"On time, easy to navigate, clean",Seoul metro is very easy to use even for first timers. The maps are laid out and everything is in english too. Only downside is rush hour is INSANE and Seoul is so large it takes forever to get across the city.
Slow but efficient and clean,"Compare to America, its fast, but compare to Japanese subway its slow.But it is super clean and safeYou can go anywhere in the city without enduring the city traffic, its cheap however you will be walking stairs and and many meters to get in and out of the subway tunnel.Seoul is a great walking city I guess"
most logical metro in the world,"Initially it is daunting to use the metro as it is so huge and complex but every line is colored and every stop is numbered and actually it is extremely logical. There are really clear signs for the different numbered exits for each station and clear signs indicating where to find restrooms. It gets exceptionally crowded on some lines -- but people line up in a very organized manner. However, people pack in like sardines. On the other hand, I felt safe even in the crowded carriage."
astonishing metro,When we visit Seoul we only use as transportation the city metro. Its technology and cleanness is something amazing. 
Very efficient system,"Everything is great. Train is very neat, almost no trash whatsoever. Timing is also very accurate. What needs improvement is the availability of more signs in English language."
"Cheap, easy, fast","We bought T-money cards from a 7/11, topped them up using the recharge terminals at the metro stations, and used the metro to travel all over Seoul. Cheap, easy to use and fast. We found the maps especially easy to read. No worries for those who don't read Korean, all station names etc. are displayed in both Korean and English script."
"Affordable, clean and easy","Seoul subway lines is easy to understand, affordable, clean, kids friendly and also on time.It's a good mass transportation connecting the whole area in Seoul. So you can explore Seoul using the subway train."
Easy to use and cheap,"Very easy to use subway system, cheap and all ticket vending machines are in English aswell as many other languages. Very clean but very busy during rush hour just the same as any big city. There is normally a digital display onboard the train that announces every stop in Korean and English which is also a big help."
Easy access ,By one card in like 7/11 or similar cost 4000 .And then you can at the same time load it with cash. Then you are a local traveler You can easy refill on every station and it works in bus and trainsMetro is easy and accessible. Only but is that it stops at 24.00?
Convenient way to move around Seoul,"Be sure to get your T-money when you arrive at the airport to use at metro stations and convenient stores. The vending machines at stations are plenty (with English option). The network is huge and easy (like all other subways). English signages are everywhere, you just have to be alert. There’re many many steps and stairs to go up and down during transfers, sometimes it was difficult to find where the escalators or elevators were. "
Great system!,"Great subway system, easy to understand maps.Conveniently located at all the major attractions, will recommend travellers to have a go at it. Buy a new card from the station or any convenient stores, top up at stations with cash and you are good to go.Trips cost within the city is a fix rate, at Korean won 1,250 or 1,280. And if you travel further, it’s an extra 100 won.Download the Korean subway map for easy transits.Most of the stations comes with an elevator for the elderly, wheelchair, stroller and luggage.Gates are clearly stated too!"
Marvellous,"A wonderful transport system. Although most of it is in Korean, there is enough in English to make journeys manageable. There are lots of different lines, named by number and colour. Travel is so cheap. Trains run regularly and on time. I travelled with an elderly person and there is disabled access and lifts at all stations we visited. Most people wait in the marked queues and get on board in an orderly fashion.One warning, beware of older Koreans. They are incredibly rude, will push in, push people over and elbow their way through. Other Koreans say nothing because they must respect their elders. Twice the 82 year old I was with was pushed over by them! "
Superb convenient,You can get to anywhere in seoul with this superb metro train. Affordable and convenient. Always on time and clean. 
Clean and goes frequently,"The electronic Tablo in railway carriage is very comfortable, you can see where you are now and how many stops are left to your station."
"Great network, low frequency compared to Beijing but much longer trains","Very good network and easy usage. Negative : you cannot purchase a smart card in the subway. You must buy one in a convenience store and load it. Otherwise very good and gigantic network. Personally, as a Beijing resident, I prefer the one I use regularly not only because it is much cheaper, as all other prices when comparing Beijing and Seoul but also frequency is much higher.Truth is that it might be easier to get a seat in Seoul rather than in Beijing. Both are very safe and secure. "
Typical Korean efficiency ,Might be tricky at first finding the route and stations. Download the app. Clean efficient and always timely 
Really convenient as taxi are quite expensive,Directions and instructions are pretty easy to understand. However does not always provide information on how to get to key touristic sites.
"Easy to use, if you have good directions","We found the Seoul Metro easy to use, we even transferred lines. The system is color coded and mapped out."
Low cost travel !,"While you are in Seoul, the metro is a great idea to travel with. Easy to go around comfortable and fast to travel."
Well connected intercity transport,Good transportation system and very systematic.Convenience and cheap too..Have signage so you will not be lost
Fast and easy ride,"WellOrganise map , ticketing system have multi languageRemember to get your 500won refund at the machine.Basically if you travel anywhere in korea, it cost 1350 +500(refundable single ticket) Just somehow its crowded during peak but yeah tats city life "
cleanest metro i've seen,"where are the trash? the graffiti? crazy people? Not at Seoul Metro! I've never seen such a clean efficient metro system! The map is a little daunting at first because of the difficult Korean names, and the multiple colored lines, but once you get the hang of it, its so easy! I downloaded Kakao Metro, and it actually will map out the lines for you to take. Highly recommend downloading that app! "
A Modern Maze,"The Seoul Metro is a mix of old and new, Some cars are modern and the others are old. there is no consistency in the signage and it is not easy to understand the direction the train is going. "
Good value,I really enjoyed navigating the subway system. Coupled with the Naver Map app you can find your way around with ease!
Great way to commute and good service ,The Seoul metro is a good way to get between places and its pretty easy. Download the metro app and you will be fine.The metro card can be purchased at the station at vending machine or at the mart at the station. The card cost 3000 won and then you add credit. Mostly it cost 1 dollar between stations. 
"Not user friendly, especially for old people, heavy luggages","Trains going in different directions are not interconnected below. So if you accidentally entered the wrong direction, you will need to pay for one way trip just to tag out & in again in the opposite direction. Furthermore, a lot of the stations do not have elevator/escalator & mostly are staircases. My mom has bad knee & have to climb so many stairs. A good example is Myeongdong station. There is escalator to go up from B2F to B1F. Then, a flight of stairs (all exits are the same) from B1F to 1F. Bad knee + heavy luggage is definitely not easy. So not tourist friendly, people friendly, unlike Japan."
alot of stairs..few escalatorss,long walk line connections....MRT is a older system than in HK...some 150 -200m line connections w/ tunnels....only moving walk walk was nr air express station all tunnels walk...i gues winter is cold up there..
A very well connected metro,"I have used this 3 to 4 times when I was in Seoul. It is very well connected, fast and reasonable pricing."
Excellent system ,Easy system well connected stations. The wagons are clean and the information is available in English language too. 
Excellent!,"I rode both around the city and to the airport. The system is easy to use and very reasonable priced. There are stops close to pretty much anywhere. Announcements in Korean, English and Japanese"
Why not use it?,"It’s cheap, gets you everywhere. Fairly easy to navigate. Get a Tmoney card and you are all set . its extremely safe. "
Fast and Convenient,"Great way to get around in Korea, even for someone with limited to no understanding of the language. "
Seoul Metro,Public transport use in Seoul is not the easiest and very few speak English. Stations also seems to be some distance to walk from most tourist locations and/or hotels.Rather use Uber if you not wanting to walk long distances 
Great way to get around. ,"Disclaimer: We did learn to read hangul(the Korean alphabet) before coming and I think that helped. I can't quite remember, but it's possible that some important signage didn't have English translation. The metro was relatively easy to figure out... as long as you knew where you wanted to end up. We got ourselves tmoney cards and a portable wifi ($6 a day) which meant we could always Google a route and it would tell us which train or bus we needed to take and which exit to use. It only took a day or two to become comfortable getting around this way. "
Easy & Cheap,"I think using Seoul Metro to move around is the best way to visit different destinations for tourists, it is so easy to use and we did download the app to help us travelling too. Buy a T money card in any convenience store (3000 won normal design and 4000 - 5000 won for special characters) and top up with some amount ( you can make payments for other purchases too not necessary only pay for transportation) 1,250 won for each trip, you can travel to any stations, not sure if there are different charges in different line, with our experience, 4 - 10+ stations we only paid for 1,250 round trip per person. It is consider very cheap compare to HK MTR or Japan side."
Always on time,Seoul metro is always on time. It has wifi with excellent signal and we love it. This transport system is so efficient and thus we are confident that we will reach all our destinations without delay. Thanks.
Seoul Subway: Easier than NYC or D.C.,"I'm from the USA; I find it easier to navigate Seoul Subway System than NYC or D.C.Pros: Clean, quiet, easy/simple to follow; multi-language signs (usually Hangul, English, and Chinese); cellphone apps make it very easy (I use MetroidHD since I travel between Seoul, Daegu, and Busan); shopping in the underground---oh my!!!; depending on what station you go through the food is good (Jamsil station has a real Krispy Kreme where you can see and get donuts actually coming out of the fryer and glazer); heated seats on the trains in the winter time; modernCons: It will get crowded during rush hour. You may get nudged or slightly pushed. Do not take this as rudeness; it is just a part of life in Seoul. Hints: Get a T-money card to ride the subway system (you can also use these in most taxis in Seoul. Not all Line 1 trains go all the way to Bosan and Dongducheon. Some will have end of the line at Uijeongbu or other Nowon-Gu area stops. Use an app like MetroidHD to let you know when you will do transfers and at what stations you will change trains. Don't sit in the elderly, pregnant, or handicap spaces unless you are old, with child, or disabled...it's culturally sensitive and it's the right thing to do."
One of the best systems in the world,Easy to navigate and goes almost anywhere you need. The price is great as well. Everything is so new and technological. The map is easy to read and even transfers are great.
Excellent & Modern Way to Go,"The Seoul Metro is very convenient and inexpensive way to get around Seoul. Trains and stations are very modern, well-lit and clean. The stations and trains are quite spacious and less crowded compared to other large cities. My only negative is that the Station signs are hard to see from within the train, due signage affixed to the train windows. Also, the direction of the train was sometimes a bit difficult to decipher. Usually the direction can be determined by the end station name, but this was not clear to me on some lines. Announcements are in Korean, English and Mandarin."
Do not buy the “visitor T money card”,"We paid extra money for the “visitor or tourist T money card”. Absolutely no difference between this tourist card or the cheaper local T money card. It shows that there are “benefits” for using this tourist T money card if you show it at certain stores and restaurants...etc. But when we showed this tourist card to the cooperating businesses, they had no idea what benefit this card offers and kept telling us that it’s only used for transportation. For example, at the Hyundai department store, it says some discounts may be provided along with a free drink. But when we asked the customer service at Hyundai department store, the staff had no clue and said we had to go back to the specific store to enquire about benefits. An important note is that you can’t return and refund for the card itself and a 500won incurs if you try to refund the remaining amount in your card. "
Very good system overall,The metro system is inexpensive and a great way to get around. It is not as easy to use as some other countries have been however if you allow yourself a few extra minutes to get your bearings and to read the maps you should be fine.The ticket machines took cash only and seemed to only want more crisp bills.Sometimes there is a wait between trains.We used the system numerous times.
Reliable and On-time,"I and my bestfriend met in Seoul after my solo trip in Busan. The train system in Korea is really reliable and helpful. Imagine travelling alone and you just read official site and signages. Though you ask the locals for details, it is only for confirmation. I have uploaded the basic things you need when travelling via train whether it by SRT (second fastest train) or the subway."
"Excellent, safe way of getting around the city","I used the Seoul Metro extensively during my last visit to this fascinating city. I particularly liked the ease of use, the excellent signposting, cleanliness, extensive route system and the fact that it was easily affordable. I found it easy to navigate and, on most trains the electronic screens gave helpful information on which station was coming up and on which side of the train to alight.One needs to bear in mind that the underground system is very expansive. So going down stairs to the next Metro station invariably means quite a walk before you finally find the track you need. Oh, and if you buy single tickets, do remember to reclaim your 500 Won deposit. For the first couple of days I didn't and I guess the maid in the hotel picked up my ""spent"" tickets in the rubbish bin. If you travel in the evening rush hour expect the journey to be hot. And it's obvious that garlic is a key ingredient in Korean cuisine when you get on a hot, crowded rush hour train. Delightful...Oh, and bear in mind that this is not a 24 hour service. I got caught out after a pub crawl in Itaewon. Trains don't run much past midnight which, therefore, gives you a great opportunity to try out the taxis. But all in all, a really excellent, safe way of getting about here."
Clean & efficient ,The Seoul Metro is effortlessly accessible.Tickets are cash onlyPhone apps mandatory to assist navigating for non Koreans 
"Seoul Metro, Seoul, South Korea.","The finest thing that one can say about the Seoul Metro, or any metro system in the entire world, is that it compares favorable to that of the Hong Kong Metro. The Seoul Metro certainly is in that class.I was amazed at the Seoul Metro. It is clean. It is easy to navigate. The metro cars are clean. The riders I encountered were friendly and polite. It seems to cover the greater Seoul area quite well.Bottom Line : The Seoul Metro is as good as it gets."
Safe and functional metro,"Really usable metro, easy to use, buy the multi usable card, makes travelling easy.Check the exits from the map."
Very Nice and efficient,I had the opportunity to use the metro while living in Seoul and I can't complain. Not hard to understand easy to get around even for those of us who don't speak Korean. 
Super Metro,"I bought an m-pass 7 day ticket for 61,500 won, which was perfect for me as I intended to use the metro so much. I took it to Suwon, Bukhasan national park (Dobongsan stop) and various stops on the airport line for several days. I more than had value from my ticket. The metro system is so large it goes for so many kilometres in all direction from the centre. Stops and interchange stations easy to use and so clean. Highly recommended."
Easy to use,I recommend getting a T Money Card to speed getting in and out of the metro. You also save 100 Won per ride.
Best way to go around Seoul.,The subway and the trains are very clean. Toilets are also clean. We are with our kids who are tech savvy so we did not have problems navigating the subway as well as in getting tickets (reloadable cards). Also very safe. No pickpockets unlike notorious Paris. Thank God!
Different and difficult ,So it's take some time before you can understand it. And the system with returning system of you ticket???? And so few ticket machine on the station and a lot of people. Hard to find the station on the machine. Have experience a lot better metro system. 
Easy of travel,The Seoul metro is a great way to experience all parts of the Seoul metropolitan area. But it is a bit confusing at first and if a person has mobility issues it can be difficult. Escalator and elevators seem to be few and far between. If someone can climb stairs it is a great way to get around town. We used both the subways and the bus system. 
free and easy,"Travelling around Seoul on their Metro is easy. Tourist who do not understand Korean will have to keep close attention to the electronic message board, which will show the where next train stop is. The message also flash once, that is why we need to pay close attention. Most tourist spots are accessible by the Metro lines."
Thet have made it so simple,"Each line is a different colour and to go between subway lines there are painted coloured lines through the staition to show you where to go. The doors to get on the train have arrows showing which direction on the line they are travelling, add in the app which shows you what line to get, where to change line and what stops you go through it is all very easy to navigate. "
"Reliable, fast and safe","This is one of world´s most reliable, fast and safe subway. All written in english/Korean, english speaking anywhere. Dont use Taxi, discover Seoul by subway! recommendable experience."
Easy to use,"Very user- friendly, especially if you have a T- money card. Ticket machines and route maps are in English as well as Korean and all stations have neighbourhood maps and tourist attractions marked clearly with the right exit information."
Best way of transportation in Seoul,"Best way to get around Seoul, the subway system is super convenient and you can literally go anywhere just by subway. The seats and trains are always clean. A little bit annoying on busy hours though, because it's very crowded. :)The operating hours are 4am-1am on weekdays, and around 6am-midnight on weekends. There are also announcements made in Korean, English, Japanese and Chinese."
Not every station friendly for wheelchair,Seoul metro is good but unfortunately not every station friendly for wheelchair. The sign is minimun so we must ask a few times to get the lift
Best way to get around Seoul,"Clean, frequent, cheap and easy to use if you can't read Korean but understand English.Even the ticket machines have an English option"
Easy to use,"Download the Seoul app for the metro it’s clean, easy to use. Put in your end destination in the app it will show you where to change also at the station just put in the end destination in the ticket machine at the end of the day put your ticket in the machine and you’ll get a refund."
Easiest way to travel,"The metro is the easiest way to see everything in Seoul. There are maps that can be printed online, or printed maps at every hotel, or posted maps in every station. We purchased a 24 hour unlimited ride pass and it was well worth the price. "
One of the best metro,This is one of the best metro city coverage that I’ve ever seen! Just remember to tap in and tap out when riding 
Easy,Clean and easy to use. Keep your card so you can get money back when you get to your destination. Around $2 a ride but you get .50 back when you return the card. Ticket machines have an English option.
Cleanest & safest metro used,"We felt very safe to use the Seoul metro. It is extremely clean, well indicated & easy to use.However do not be surprised to be pushed by locals to get in & out! It is each to their own - no politeness there! If they could, they would climb over you before letting anyone out first "
Seoul Metro is fantastic!,"We visited London, New York City and Kyoto recently and Seoul has the cleanest and easiest subway system to use of all of them (we’re from Boston.) We loaded the Kakao Metro app, which made it easy to navigate. "
The most efficient way of traveling in Seoul.,"Seoul Metro is really fast and good way to go around in the city. Metro tickets are cheap and directions are quite easy to read. However, I suggest to buy T-money card from almost any little convenience store. If you do, you don't have to worry about buying tickets all the time. Also an application with subway map helps you find the fastest way, I use Kakao maps, but there are also other apps."
A little confusing at first,Getting around Seoul is easy once you figure out how they label the metro. It’s a little more confusing than some other cities at first. It after a couple of rides you’ll have no problems. The locals are also extremely friendly and will point you in the right direction so don’t worry about asking for help. Grab yourself a t money card and jump on the train! Side note: even if you don’t plan to ride the rails while you are there I strongly recommend you do at least once so you can see the gas masks kept on the platform for emergencies. It’s pretty surreal. 
"Efficient, clean, and quiet.","The metro is comfortable, quiet and reliable. Efficient, clean and comfortable. Allocated seats too. Finding where to line up for our carriage was a challenge as we were first-time users. Look on the ground for your carriage number. "
Very efficient way to travel Seoul,"Subway is the way to go as traffic can be a problem and something that you could do in 20 to 30 minutes by subway can take an hour by car.You can buy one way tickets, which will charge you 500 won ($0.50) deposit. You can get it back at machines when you get where you want to go.Alternatively, you can just tap as you enter and exit with your credit card.I suggest you download an App for the Seoul Subway that has a route planner."
Seoul metro,"metro is very convenient and cheep and on time, it takes you to the most interested places that you like to see around Seoul."
Useful ,Most of the time...the only logical way to get around Seoul. Get a Tmoney card too make it even easier.
Efficient but bit confusing,"the running of metro system is well done, efficient, clean and not noisy. Though the stations signs and announcements are in both korean and english languages, somehow the announcements in english is incomplete hence slight confusion caused. Overall experience is still good."
Very Efficient,"Overall the metro system in Seoul deserve a 5 star rating, It is very clean, spacious and well control temperature, but I am giving it 4, because I think the Seoul rider do need to learn more from Japanese in term of courtesy.In the metro system, you keep hearing the broadcast in few languages keep on remind the rider to give up seat for old people, disable people, pregnant lady, or even for those pregnant but not too visible.It tells how 'well"" behave their rider are.Personal experience ? On line 2 we are riding during the rush hour, and its our station to exit, We cant make our way out, and we are with 2 toddlers, and still they wont let us exit the metro, So the only thing I can do is to push my way out... This never happened to us in Japan.If you recall the sardine video clip of Tokyo metro ? well...my family still able to exit any metro during such situation because they all make way for people to exit no matter how pack is the rider on that train.Line is a city loop train, what I think the time to ride a circle is taking little too long, maybe they can look into it to make it more efficient."
Seoul Metro Subway,"Clean, efficient, easy to navigate, inexpensive, a great way to get around the city. Signage is bilingual (English and Korean)."
Metro of S(e)oul,"The easy access, clean, good manage made Seoul metro among the excellent public transport system. Additionally, assistant for metro user made it better. However, the best part of it is an elderly who proficient in English that stand at the main exit that kindly introduce you a famous place around there and give you some tip such as good points to take a photo.Thank you all grandpa/ma for excellent advice."
"Clean, efficient and easy to use ",Seoul metro is very clean and easy to use. The trains come very often and everything is well sign posted. 
good,"Very convenient, a nice change to European standards. Always on time and can take u literally anywhere in Korea!NICE!"
One of the best in Asia,"I think the Seoul Metro is one of the better metros in Asia. I haven't been on the Tokyo one in 10 years, so I cannot compare, but I do remember that the distinguishing factor for Seoul's is that not only do they have English for every stop, but sometimes even in Chinese and Japanese. I didn't see that all the time in Japan nor any other Asian country. Hong Kong just has Chinese and English, for the most part."
Convenient Transportation,"I got the long distance Metro and Train ticket thru online before i traveled to Seoul. Once arrived Incheon Airport, head to catch the Arex Airport Express Train to Seoul KTX Train Station and to Busan. Once in Seoul City, you merely head to the nearest Metro station to buy ticket to travel to those landmarks of your interest."
Easy to use سهل الاستخدام,"المترو نظيف و سهل الاستخدام و يوجد لغه انجليزيه في الجهاز، و يوجد مكتب معلومات عند الحاجه لأي معلومه اضافيه.Its user friendly it has english langue, There is a information office that can help "
Trains to everywhere,Crisscrossing the entire country the excellent labrynthine train system can get u anywhere abd the best part is it is almost 100%relianke and on time .Best way to neat the traffic too and plenty of shopping to distract you in the stations ..so make sure u domt miss ur train as they are alwats on time .Do t know korean..no problem info desks everywhere and even the computer ticketting kiosks have english translation and In train announcements are made in English too.
Clean and efficient,"This is by far one of the better metro systems I've used. Its clean, efficient and very reasonably priced. The music plays when the train is approaching the platform, many monitors showing you train locations, and glass doors to prevent people from falling onto the tracks. Overall a fabulous city transit!"
Convenient and clean,Easy to use and navigate. Stations and trains are clean and trains run very frequently. Easy to transfer and buy tickets. 
An efficient metro network - but that's ir,"Amazed that this is the top rated thing to do in Seoul. Surely just because so many people have reviewed it? The metro is very efficient and easy to understand but then so many other modern networks across the world are too. It's no better to those elsewhere in the region such as Tokyo, Singapore or Hong Kong. No doubt you'll find yourself on the metro but don't make a special trip because it is just an underground train network."
Very safe and clean,"The metro in Seoul is excellent and while not as many trains as in Tokyo, there are still plenty that it's not too crowded most of the time. It's quite easy to navigate too, especially with Google Maps."
Extensive metro network ,Seoul metro is one of the most extensive network in the world connecting not only Seoul center but also its suburb areas. It was on time and very efficient that you don't need a taxi to go any places in Seoul. The only lacking of Seoul metro is no air conditioned at all stations and the interval sometimes quite long. 
efficient,"The Seoul metro, like many other metro systems I've used is quite efficient. I think the metro system is easy to understand. Once you use it the first time, you get the knack of it and it becomes super easy to navigate. Also the metro map is readily available in visitors' guides and on several posters in the subway."
Seoul Metro: not difficult for a non Korean speaker to ride,All metro stations are numbered for easy checking. This way of classifying the complicating map and routes of Seoul Metro makes it very easy for non Korean tourists who know nothing about the Korean text.
"Easy, clean, affordable","Spent 4 days in Seoul travelling on the Metro. No long waits, plenty of space on the trains, stations are close to places you'll want to go. Toilets and water refill stations everywhere, information people are available, knowledgeable and helpful, with good English. The only problem we ever had was trying to find a specific exit in Seoul Station (there are 15 subway exits and 4 station exits) for a tour pickup, but that was quickly sorted when I stopped trying to find it and asked at the information desk."
Nothing new,"Full of overworked children on there way to night school. My experience was official and I know noe the system completely, its always on time. Very clean and safe. WiFi everywhere!"
Works like a clock,"The best way to move around in the city. Coming from Europe, the most incredible thing I could never even have imagined, is that every metro station has clean, nice and free toilets without weirdous, addicts etc hanging around "
Super easy to use metro,"The metro is cheap and super easy to use. You can buy a tmoney card from any convenience store. This card can be used on all of the buses, trains, and taxis. "
quite and clean,"a bit crowd in the rush hour. the seat for elder people is great.if you need to change lines, you need to walk very long way."
Convenient with economic,"서울 메트로는 2달러이하의 가격으로 서울 어느곳이나 갈수 있고 서로 다른 라인으로 갈아탈때도 티켓을 바꿀 필요가 없ㄷㆍUnlike the other cities metro, Seoul's metro system could be used with same ticket eventhough you may transfer to other subway lines. All most all the place in Seoul could be reached by Metro at the price of less than 2 US dollar."
DON'T BE AFRAID TO TRY ..,"The Seoul Metro is really easy to get around. All the stations have English; the Korean people will be more than willing to help you find your way. Even if the person you ask doesn't speak English, s/he will find someone who does. ENJOY GETTING AROUND IN SEOUL"
Seoul metro efficient public transportation,"Seoul. Big city is covered by several lines of metro. Cheep, clean, easy to go. Can go anywhere in Seoul and surrounding areas."
The Seoul Metro is an attraction in itself!!,Clean and easy to navigate the metro system. Stations are plentiful. Purchase a travel card and add money to it. Makes getting on and off each time easier.
Excellent,You can pretty much get anywhere from anywhere and it is fairly inexpensive. You need to buy a transit card but you can get them for relatively inexpensive. Gets very busy during rush hour but the rest of the day this is calm. Closes at midnight!
Very efficient,You will not get lost. Very efficient subway system. I cannot imagine the planning and construction done on this. You can transfer from one line to another. Very convenient. 
The best,Its great experience to use Seoul Metro and Subway. Its very convenience and clean You may never need taxi in Seoul.
Hardly find any lift or escalator,Big challenge for tourist like me carry large luggage travel by Seoul Metro. Long walking distance with stairs when trtansfering from one line to another. Hardly find any escalator or lift when using Seoul Metro.
Efficient and on time,"Korails are always on time and convenient specially if your commuting around south Korea. Enjoyable & fun to ride, accessible specially on transfers from mall to mall"
Soo easy and comfortable,"This was amazingingly simple, cheap and easy to use. It has stops in all the hotspots and is easy to use to get around."
Very easy to take !,"The subway is perfectly easy to take for a foreigner, there are vending machines that are in english that sell you the ticket - its actually a card you have to keep with you until your exit. All the signs are in English. We even found some volunteer Koreans that were just there to help travelers. "
Convenient and well connected,The metro system across Seoul is the most convenient mode of transport. Help is also easily available at the station and most of the instructions are in English so it's easy to comprehend for foreigners. The underground station markets are also good for shopping/grabbing a quick bite.
Clean and modern,"Seoul Metro is the fastest and easiest way to get around Seoul. Trains are on time, clean and modern!"
Clean and efficient,"Excellent way to travel all around Seoul. On time, and very well maintained stations. Modern metro with free wifi."
Fast and Ontime,Easy to use. English also included in both signs and onboard announcement. Fast and ontime arrival and departure. Wifi available.
Clean & fast train ,Easily accessible & fast. Changing from Station to another station was easy. Thumb up for the effectiveness of the Seoul Metro
The most efficient public transportation I have been riding in my life... Have it with Kakao Metro instead,"I have to say South Korea (Seoul in my experience) has one of excellent transportation system in the world. What surprised me is that the train was not as packed as train in Tokyo or Jakarta and had background music to announce train departure, arrival, even when it is on the way. Announcement is made in 4 languages: English, Japanese, Korean, and Chinese both on speaker and sign board alongside an arrow pointing at which door would be opened so that passengers could stand before it and disembark. Most of the time it is punctual (which makes it efficient transportation to ride). Also, to make the trip is even more efficient, I would like to recommend an apps named Kakao Metro. Users need to input their destination and place of origin and the apps will lead them to appropriate route. While it is useful to enroute passengers through subway, Kakao Metro is also useful for riding bus. Despite its efficiency and cleanliness, I would like to remind those who bring heavy luggage on board since station buildings tend to have many stairs to climb - some also have elevator and escalators, but still in limited numbers"
"Excellent, roast, easy & clean","The metro is a super easy (once you get the hang of it) way to get around Seoul. All stations are in both English and Korean, as are all announcements whilst on the train. Whilst it is easy to get around, don’t underestimate the size of the city, nor the transfer times you might need to change lines."
Easy and Convenient,"The best subway system I've experienced. Clean, fast, and essential for any trip to Seoul! Get a T-Money card, one per person, and enjoy the ride."
"Prompt, clean Metro","Rode the metro the 7 days we were in Seoul. We were able to get around as the signs were in English. Metro was, for the most part, clean, with some stations having shops. The rail map looks complicated but easy to figure out."
Very easy to find your way,"Traffic in Seoul can be time consuming. Metro is by far the fastest way to get from one point to another. Download a map of the metro system so you always got one with you. Every station has numbers so it is easy to find out which way to go. Ticket machines are in all the stations I have been to. 1.450 won for a typical ride. Deposit is 500 won which you get back in another machine when you drop the ticket. Not sure the machines take credit cards. Only saw some for cash. It’s around 1,3 USD per ride."
Perfect,The Seoul metro is the way to travel in this city. It is fast clean and safe and always on time. Closest comparison is Switzerland! Only problem is that it can get very crowded at rush hours!
Brings you to all (almost) the tourist attractions,The train network is comprehensive. It brings you to almost all tourist attractions in Seoul. Plus the frequency of the train is high. The free train map is easy to understand but you may want to bring a magnifying glass if you have difficulties in reading mini micro fonts. 
Super efficient,"I really loved how connected all the trains were compared to other places that have different companies/stations. The metro cards were also easy to use and reload. The machines had multiple languages. The trains were fast and you never have to wait long for one to arrive. I also found the platforms really easy to navigate, with English languages, and announcements. "
Wonderful,The Seoul Metro is easy to use as everything is written in English. It's also easy to plan your day using this means of transportation. It's so cheap. 
5 days in Seoul,Subway is very efficient and reasonably priced. Best to by a subway rechargeable card. Can by at 7 eleven and other places. Just tap going and coming. Add money to card anytime. Can get close to most Seoul tourist locations.
Great metro,The Seoul metro is great. I highly recommend downloading the Seoul Metro App and also buy a T card. Both will make traveling so much easier. 
great,"Most easy and convenient to go around Seoul. There are many lines, but easy to understand and most are interchangeable. You just need t-money and you can tap tap. "
Modern Technology in Life,"Easy to use whenever you want to go anywhere in the seoul city area. You need a pass or travel card like as RailPass, Tmoney, CashBee. You can those card from 7eleven, Ministop and CU retail chain."
Smooth flowing but don't get lost.,"We found the metro quite easy to follow and use. However, we have used metros all over the world. Some could find it daunting! Be prepared for multi levels and long passages. Keep the tickets for a souvenir "
Awesome metro system!,I am a female and traveled solo for a few days in Seoul and taking the metro around the city was quite a breeze. The trains either move very fast or the distance between each stops were very near. Great service from the metro staff too. 
The cleanest and safest Metro I have been on,"This has to be one of the cleanest and safest feeling metro trains i have taken. TIP: Get a T-card and load it for your fares. Also, download the App ""Subway"". You can put in your destination and it will guide you to where you need to go. Very easy. In the summer the cars are cooled and comfortable."
Lead you everywhere,"Very organized, Seoul metro take you to main tourist spots all over the city: palaces, parks, shopping spots."
Reaches everywhere ,"The transportation network in Seoul is one of the best in the world, i used naver map to navigate, it tells me the train direction and what exit i should go to and if there is no train you can go by the bus which is equally as good and it announces stops in english also."
Peter G,"Reasonably easy to buy tickets and get refunds and work out which line to get, even for English speakers. Definitely worth doing to get more embedded into Seoul "
Metro,Once you get the hang of it the Metro is so easy to use. Koreans really helpful and willing. Air conditioned trains a treat.
Brilliant Metro System,"So easy to navigate and get around Seoul on the Metro (and cheap!). The Metro card is easy to buy from a vending machine and you can top it up at any CU, GS25 or other convenience store which are found everywhere and pretty much always open. Card was only about 4,000 won I think but you can buy 'couples' cards - saving 1,000 won which we didn't realise til after we brought two separate cards. Trips were only 1,250 (I think) or there abouts but when you tap off and on through the gates you get a balance - same as when you top up at a store. You only save a small amount by having the travel card but it is so convenient to not have to deal with cash for every trip. We barely waited for more than 5 minutes at any stop (and we used it a lot!) Definitely a brilliant way to explore Seoul."
Convenient way to travel around Seoul,"You can choose to buy a single trip ticket at the machine or get the T-money, either available at convenience store, machines or at the counter at airport terminal station.Topping up the card is fuss free too, you can choose from English or chinese language and follow the instructions. One improvement to be done is to make the name of the stations more visible, the names of the stations at the end of the lines are included beside the main station and people can get confused which is the station name, It is a good touch that passengers can put their stuff like bags etc up at the metal racks above the seats, if it is too heavy to carry or when the train is crowded. One thing to note is that there are express trains available, I saw it along 1 of the lines at the Express bus terminal, however it can get super packed during peak hours like after work so it is almost impossible to board it. It is time-saving if you are able to board it, as it helps shorten your journey by skipping some of the stations in between. Do download the 'subway' app on your phone as it is handy in telling you the fastest route to get from one station to another and especially if you need to transfer to another line to get to your destination. It is definitely less attention seeking than opening up the tourist map on the train. Do prepare to walk a lot if you need to transfer trains. It is best to prepare a lanyard to hang the T-money around your neck, as you may need to tap the card a few times if you need to transfer trains. The standard fare is 1250 won for shorter journeys and it will be deducted once you tap the card the first time, if your journey is very long, you may need to pay an additional 200 won if I remember correctly when you tap out. Follow the signs in the stations and you will not get lost even if you need to transfer to another train at another line."
Excellent ,The metro is convenient and price is normal. Just that sometimes may be too many people. Recommended to use
Excellent transit system,I downloaded the “KakaoMetro” ap and it made travelling by subway simple. You can even set a prompt to let you know when you are arriving at your station. Even though there is a call out on the train in several languages including English - the Korean pronunciation is often quite different to what an English speaking person would expect the name to sound like.Also the subway stations often have several exit gates - the wrong one can put you across or down the street from where you want to be.The trains come every few minutes and cost about 1200 won per trip. Purchase a card at any station and load it. It only took me a couple of days to really get the hang of it and I’m from an older generation - great way to get around. 
Great Way to Travel ,The Seoul subway is extensive and easy to travel on. Ticket machines have an English menu and the Station names are also in English too. Give it a go!
"Fast, clean, safe, convenient","They have an extensive train system. This is the way to travel around the city. It is fast, clean, safe and convenient. They have English and Chinese signages so tourists will not get lost. "
best subway system i've ever used,so so easy to navigate i was a bit scared at first as i wasn't sure if it was going to be easy to navigate but it was more than easy always on time and very very clean :) 
"English good, a lot of walking. ","There are English signs like station names send directions on each station, it's pretty clear where to navigate. Also there are free toilets on stations and convenient stores.The only problem for me was more stairs less escalators. And the transfer between the lines is not always fast, you have to walk sometimes 5min to change line. Another good thing is that it's practically impossible to fall on the rail since there are protection walls with doors. "
How can this be the #1 tourist attraction in Seoul?,"There is so much to see in Seoul, while it’s true that the subway can get you around effectively, it is not the top tourist attraction in a city with so much to offer.If you’re looking for something unusual to do, be sure to visit the mind-blowing Trick Eye Museum. How about Lotteworld—South Korea’s own Disneyland, but indoors? Not to mention the palaces, especially the Secret Garden at the Changdeokgang Palace. Then there’s the stunning architecture.That said, if people think the subway is the best thing about visiting Seoul, the buses are the worst. The drivers are terrible. If you can’t get a seat, hold on tight because you’ll be lurching all over the place."
Super Clean,If you compare to any other city in Europe or USA. Subway here is clean clean clean and very safe and convenient. 
Probably the best subway system worldwide,"It is accurate pretty straight forward, the descriptions are in English Chinese and Korean CLEAN fast easy the best way to travel around the city away from constant traffic on ground"
dream transportation,so fast and convenient! at first it was kinda confusing we often doubt ourselves if we took the right bus (they call the train bus according to our itx ticket).. it's a dream transpo for my country
Navigating Seoul ,I have been in Seoul for 6 days and used the metro trains 3 times. It is safe and clean and I would recommend traveling by train. The names of stations are in Koreanand English and the announcement on the train line and in the train for each station are in English.There are a number of things you need to know. 1. Check line number as each one is a different colour. Check subway map for line numbers.2. When you go to the line platform work out where your station is in relation to which direction the train is going. There are signs that state which platform is going to which station eg. we got on in City Hall on line 2 (green) and traveled towards Jamsil station (as our stop was Samseong).3. Once you get to your station there are often 6-8 exits each putting you above ground in different directions. Look at map on subway wall for the exit you need.4. Cost is cheap with a 45 min ride costing $5AUD or $3900 won for 2 of us.Korean people were helpful. Although not all spoke English there were a few that could. 
Cheap and excellent,"Seoul is a big place, so to think their metro-system would be idiot-proof is just plain silly. Taking the train is cheap, fast and efficient-and the maze of subway exits means that one doesn't need to brave the elements for too long to get to their exact destination. A highly sophisticated and organized system"
make sure you know which exit to take,the subway links to almost the whole of Seoul.but make sure you know which exit to take as different exits lead to different parts of the area.
Long week end ,"Very comfortable to use and easy when you get use to. You have to buy your ticket in the vending machine, be careful writing the destination you want to go (not fixed price, but per destination).The line 2 (cercos one) is very useful to go to many destinations and also Line 1. Stations are big and many stairs, be ready to walk and check your exit number to be close to your destination.If you buy a one way ticket, like we did, you are charged KRW500 per ticket as a deposit which is fully refundable after the trip. There are machines to refund deposit after last check out.Easy, big, check your line number and don’t get confused with the exit numbers (it can happen)"
Accessible,Going around Seoul is quite easy using the seoul metro. Must obtain T-money card at the airport which will be use as trains fare. You can easily reload it in every station. interval of trains is just 2-3 mins. Train was also very clean. Dont forget to download seoul metro’s station line Map. 
"Easy, efficient and convenient",The best way to get around Seoul is the metro. It is inexpensive and easy to navigate. Signs are in Korean and English.
Great way of geting arounf,"Great subway system, clean and efficient. Good signage in Korean and English. Like detailed maps on which exit to use. Buy yourself a ""T Money "" card. There are self service vending machines at most stations, you buy your card (3000) then you choose how much money to put on it and charge it up. All simple with English instructions. Min cost of journeys was 1250 in Seoul and 1300 in Busan. Just under a pound ! Then you are ready to go local! Tap your card in, your shown amount taken and balance left. Tap out at journey end - if any additional taken this is shown with balance. You will be amazed how far £1 gets you! You are not charged for transfers between lines.Dont worry about leaving loads of money on the card when its time to go home.......you can get a refund, only place to do this at Incheon Airport T1 was the CU store on level 1. Our refunds paid for breakfast at airport. You dont get your 3000 back for the card - you keep the cards.To charge up your cards you can use machines at stations or find local CU stores and they can also do it."
Very reliable!,"Their metro is indeed very reliable. It's always on time unless something happens. It's not exactly cheap, but the fare is worth it. Almost all of the tourist attractions have a near metro so it's a very convenient mode of transportation for locals and tourists alike."
Reliable and efficient.,Perhaps one of top metro systems in the world. Both the trains and the stations are well maintained and CLEAN. All stations have arrival information of trains. 
Clean and efficient.,Clean and efficient. Be ready to climb a lot of stairs as not all stations are handicapped-friendly. Not every station has escalators.
Better than taxi,"Avoid peak hours for taxi, the jam is so so bad that u are wasting time! Take the metro during peak hours - best way "
Seoul,"Korean Subway is very effectives and clean. But to me is hard for me not understanding Korean word, even thought it have Chinese Wording I still find it hard to understand how the subway is operate. And the description on the apps or maps doesn’t match some of it. Like said transfer within 3 mins but it doesn’t really 3mins"
Sightseeing ,Excellent - English signboards and Self Service Ticket counters are informative. If totally lost Can look for very friendly staff to guide you with their minimal English.The subway train is clean and air-conditioned. Remarkably courteous Koreans who vacate their seats for me (grey hair middle age male).I felt safe with the subway. Well Done Seoul
Best way to explore Seoul.,"A good way to go around in a city when you are a tourist is by using the public transportation. I think that in Seoul city taxis can be expensive and buses are good but maybe not as fast as the Subway, that's why I'm going to recommend you to use the subway if you are planning a trip in Seoul city. Two things that you have to consider before heading to the nearest subway station are: buying a T-Money card which you can find at the convenience stores and downloading the Seoul subway metro app.The T-Money card is a public transportation card that can be used in Buses and subways in the metropolitan cities in South Korea, you can find these transportation cards in retail stores like GS25, CU, 7-Eleven, Ministop and more. How to use it? well, first you have to add balance to the card, ask the staff of the retail shop where you bought the card to please charge your card with money. secondly, once in the subway station, you have to tap your card on the sensor located on top of the subway turnstile until it beeps. The sensor will display the amount charged on the top and the remaining balance at the bottom. Please remember that you also have to tap your card before going out of the subway station.About the Seoul City metro app. This is a very handy app if you are in Seoul because this app will provide you with the Subway map of Seoul city. You can plan your route by double tapping on the subways stations, the app will aloud you to select the departing and place of arrival and will also let you see the timetables of the train you are about to aboard. The User Interface of this app is friendly and you can find it in both, Korean and English language. You will also see the subway maps in the subway stations and inside the trains as well or you can get one of this maps in your hotel and at the touristic information centers in Seoul.all in all, I think that by using the Seoul city metro you can save time and money, and since the trains are clean and equipped with air conditioner during the summer and heaters during the winter you can make your trip more pleasant. I also have to add that most of the hot places in Seoul like shopping malls, markets, stadiums, museums, parks, palaces, and universities are designated with at least one subway station, this really makes it easy to get to your destination of preference."
It's the best way to discover Seoul,"There are so many routes that help you to go to your destination in a convenience way. Using T-money card can make your journey easy and convenient. You can easily to understand that where you are since the subway has the English announcement. The subway is clean and neat. It's also easy to transport to the ICN airport. Although the stairs are a lot, it's still overall excellent transportation to tourists.(真的是個很棒的地鐵，裡面很乾淨，也很方便轉乘，適合新手觀光客第一次來訪，不太會迷路，都有中英文標示，)"
Good,"Staff service standard is Vert high . Provide correct information to traveler.alway smile ,nice uniform"
Great way to get around Seoul,Spent a long weekend in Seould and the metro is a great way to get round the city. Signs in the trains are in English which is a great help and you can get a travel ticket which you simply swipe like a contactless card / oyster card. You have to buy the card outside / away from the stations so beware but from then on it is simple. Just top up and go. GReat. Why can the UK work in such a simple format
So easy to navigate and clean,"Probably one of the best subways I've used anywhere. It's clean and efficient. It's very affordable and safe. I never felt like I couldn't find my destination, even not speaking Korean. They have everything pretty much translated into English and it was fantastic. "
I like it,I stayed this hotel few days . It was amazing dayI really like it . The stuff were very very kind ❤️Thank you for everything
very good for english speaking persons,good to travel with bilingual maps incluing English. Be ready to walk if you need to change line. Be careful where a line change possible.
"Clean, convenient, cheap (and crowded)","Highly efficient way to get around Seoul and surprisingly affordable, especially with the available MPass for foreigners. I was surprised however that no matter location, time of day, day of week, etc. there were never any seats available - always filled. Plenty of room to stand however, except during commute times. If pregnant no worries, plenty of reserved seating which appears to be strictly respected. There is a fair amount of senior and disabled seating reserved but these were almost always filled as well. All in all a great way to quickly get around town."
Efficient and clean ,"The transport system is efficient and clean. I used Citymapper to choose routes, which was great. My suggestion would be to allow credit card payment in addition to the travel card required. Eg. In London UK there is a travel card option and credit card option for payment "
Very Efficient,"It's easy to travel with Seoul Metro as the signboards of 4 different languages (Korea, English, Chinese and Japanese) are very helpful. It's efficient and the rate is diverse."
Korail is good,Can be very busy and comfortable at peak hours. Very efficient to the minute.The underground subway transports millions of people everyday without a problem. Unbelievably geniusly designed. 
The Best Way to Travel Around Seoul,"Get a T-Money Card at 7-Eleven or G25 store and experience traveling Seoul on the Metro for jus a few dollars. It takes you everywhere within the city conveniently. Just try to avoid rush hours. It will get crowded if you’re claustrophobic. Overall, the best way to travel in Seoul on a cheap budget."
Very convenient ,Seoul meyro is the easiest way to get around the city. Get a T money card from any convenience store or eben at the station amd you are ready to go. We were 3 people so many times it was almost the same as taking a taxi and we ended up using taxis more.
Reliable transport system ,"I was very sure that I could travel alone in Seoul as the country has an excellent transport system. I studied basic Korean, but my Korean is not really up to scratch. However, there's nothing much to worry about because Seoul's transportation system is so accessible that you don't need to know Korean to travel around. The whole city is so well-connected and there's no place that you can't go in Seoul!"
"Seoul Metro, not bad",Route directories are clear and easy to read. The cabin are clean and quiet. It is a good place if you like travel with railway.
Excellent train system.,"Here in Seoul for 2 weeks visiting my son.Travelled on the subway each day. All train stations clean,as are trains and toilet facilities. Great way to get around, very reasonable cost. Other passengers very helpful when I needed directions, many gave me their seat as I use a walking stick. Recommend this Metro to visitors to Seoul."
You must ride the subway,I was so blown away by how clean and lovely the subways are! As a New Yorker I am a veteran . . . and an added benefit is all the underground shopping!
Seoul Metro,"Clean, efficient and easy to navigate!One thing i notice, which is a cultural thing, i believe. No one says 'excuse me' when they're trying to pass you on the train or even anywhere....on the bus....they just squeeze by...but Seoul Metro is great. Get a T-Money card and you can refill it as often as you like and can even use it at stores to purchase things. it works both for buses and trains."
Great system covering the whole city,"Clean, efficient, air conditioned. Very easy to use (though you might need glasses for the small maps!). You need to buy a card before charging it - these are sold at small grocery shops which are located near the metro."
Easy to use,I needed to change airports in Seoul to travel within the country. Signs for the train were clear (even for foreigners!). I so appreciated this. The train itself was clean and on-time. I wish every major city in the world had something as well maintained and operated as this!
systematic and on time,you can download the submay map app (i recommend 'subway korea' available on app store & google play store) to plan your trip. It will show the fastest route and transfer information with accurate fare.
Average metro,"This is an average metro, compared to other countries. Singapore metro is still the best for me though, but hey it serves its purpose well"
"Accessible, inexpensive, well-run","I've used the Seoul Metro on all of my previous visits to the city, and have always found it to be a much appreciated convenience and a good value. The signage--in Korean, Chinese, Japanese, and English--is well-placed and helpful."
Clean and easy,"Easy to get around then surface traffic. Skip the taxi and use the subway. Cheap, clean and once you know your sto, pretty straightforward"
Easy and convenient,"Easy to use, Suggest you buy the T-money card in one of the seven eleven / vending machine near stations"
Best in the world,Best metro in the world. Fast. Easy to get from a to b. Good air conditioning. Not too crowded. Cheap. 
Very convenient,"Very well connected, fast and convenient. Slightly confusing to read the signs as I was more used to the Japanese rail network where the lines have names. Here they are numbered. Directions on platforms are little difficult to understand, but once you get a hang of it, very good."
Reliable public transport in unreadable alphabet,"Seoul Metro became the most reliable public transport in Seoul for me who could not read any of Koran alphabet nor speaking Korean language. I found out that even in the tourism area the officer hardly speak English, so...I never expected the taxi drivers could speak English too. Seoul Metro with its clear route map has helped me a lot to go around Seoul. It's just as easy as reading the map of London underground, Singapore MRT, or Bangkok BTS, and it reaches every site of Seoul (North, South, West, East). We just buy T-money at the kiosk in Airport, an top it up whenever the balance going down to 1500 Won. When I visited Seoul last July, 1 trip by Seoul Metro just cost me 1250 Won, meaning when I entered the Metro station until I was out. It did not cost me more for how many changes I made as long as I was not out of the station. The Metro is very comfortable, clean, and punctual. It also provides passengers with strong wifi, so we can keep connected."
Well thought out system and easy to see directions,"It was a breeze travelling onboard the metro system. The signs and graphics were all very helpful in finding our way in Seoul. The announcements were in Korean, English and I even heard Mandarin and Japanese some times. The ticket machines are also easy to use, allowing for a change of a language you are familiar with. We did not experience any disruptions throughout our trip. "
It can take you everywhere... if you have the time.,I have used this system often and the only drawback is the time it take to get from place to place. They have recently changed things so you cannot travel directly to the airport from other regions in Korea. I believe this is a huge mistake on their part and am now more inclined to take the bus (it will drop me directly at the terminal) versus having to take 3 trains just to get to the terminal. This would really be a challenge if I had bags or small children.
No need to go off the rails on the Seoul subway!,"Much like every other metro system the world over, the vast Seoul subway can take some time to master but, fear not, two or three rides in - and paying attention to your map - you should be getting comfortable underground. The city is indeed enormous, so the subway is the most efficient way of exploring, and your feet at the end of a day of sightseeing will thank you. Trains are plentiful, regular and on time, and I can vouch from experience that Seoul’s is one of the safest metros in the world (I’m an experienced traveler on the New York, Hong Kong and London systems). Still, cops are a common sight, and that can only serve to reassure riders. Crucially, you’ll likely get a seat on the train no matter the time of day!"
Recommend,Seoul metro is easy to understand and includes all sraff to make you trip safe and pleasurable.It has restroom in every station that I visited))It has different price plans both for kids and adults and locals and tourists.It has safe glass that protect people from falling down to rails.
"Easy to use, wish we had this in California","We decided to take a tour of Seoul and use the metro. Very easy to navigate, extremely cost effective. Everyone is willing to help and give advice, it can be a little intimating being in such a large city. But you don't' want to drive or take a taxi in Seoul. Just ask the concierges for help before leaving the hotel and you'll be good. The metro stops are everywhere."
Efficient and reliable,"The metro is a great way to get around and we found the service to be one of the best we have encountered in any major city. Not only is it easy to navigate, it is also very reasonable to traverse the city price-wise. From our experience, unless you plan to do at least 15 journeys a day, you may be better off buying single tickets than multiple day passes. Chances are that you would visit say, 5 or 6 tourist places a day at the most and then go out to dinner in the evening. When you pay for your ticket, there is a deposit automatically included which you get back from the machines at your destination station."
Easy to navigate,"With a little map, you will have no problems understanding the colour codes and exists.Opt to pay with TMoney or just purchase single journey tickets. If you opt for the latter, remember to claim back a 500 won deposit."
I miss it already...,"Coming from Toronto, this metro system was like a breath of fresh air. It's super clean, spacious and always on time. I can read Korean so the language wasn't an issue for me, but regardless, there is English everywhere so you shouldn't run into any issues. Get yourself a T-card as well (any convenience store will have it), and it will work for taxis, the metro and even at certain supermarkets! Each ride is also so cheap and able to get you anywhere and everywhere. I highly recommend downloading the Kakao Metro app as it will tell you how to get where you need to be, fastest way to get there and even which platform to stand at for optimal convenience. Best metro system EVER!"
Seoul Metro ,"Super efficient, cheap. Get a T money card at the airport and you can use this both in Seoul and Busan. Any money you don’t end up using can be refunded ( I haven’t done this yet but I’m assuming this can be done at the airport). Definitely download the Naver app which is basically google maps but it will tell you which direction you should be going for the subway - always look at where it is “location x BOUND”. It will also clearly list the subway stations and how to change lines - That was what I struggle a bit with! "
I use the metro in Seoul and is very good.,"The only problem is that I cannot read in Korean language, but with the map provide by the hotel I was able to travel without any problem."
Easy to navigate with no Korean!,Very easy to navigate even if you don't speak any Korean. A great way to save a ton of money on taxis. Buy a t-money or cash-bee card at any convenience store and load a few dollars and you're good to go on any metro or bus in the country. Use Google maps to then figure out which train or bus to take. 
"Clean, safe, sweaty swampass","Very clean and safe subway. Much smoother ride than anything in the States. No rats, crack heads, cockroaches, or people trying to rob you.Very sweaty, humid, and crammed. Survival of the fittest or most cunning. Don't expect politeness on the subway. There could be a pregnant woman barfing with water breaking and there would still be drunk men sitting in the pregnancy seats, or girls doing makeup. If you're too slow someone might push you away or throw their bag on a seat to claim it. Expect people to point at you and talk about you, whisper, laugh, mock....(if you're a foreigner) also, it's funny when they slam tackle each other to get a seat and then nobody sits by the foreigner.The subway itself is great though. Try to find the sections on the ends if you seek something cooler. If you seek a sauna swampass torture chamber, then ride in the middle sections--- either way, from September - June, the subway is a humid death box. If you like heat then you'll love this subway. Take a towel. I use my credit cards to scrape sweat from my body. The locals don't seem to mind. It could be 1000 billion degrees in September and the AC would be off. But, the safety and the cleanliness are nice. Also--- Koreans (usually older) think it is ok to touch your baby. The younger generation has more manners. If you want someone to stop trying to rub your child's face..... Say, ""Ha-jee-ma."" That means don't do that."
Very efficient!,"Just be sure to look at the map with the English/romanised station stops and you are good to go. You will need good eyesight and good colour differentiation to work out the myriad of lines. We bought the single trip tickets through the machines. Do remember to claim back your 500 won deposit after your ride - you will be surprised to hear that prompt in English as it follows the language in which you bought your tickets. Toilets are available at the stations - very clean and well maintained, and FOC too"
Good form of transport ,A choice form of transport that brings you to most places a tourist would need including shopping areas and night markets. Affordable as well 
Great City Metro,Very convenient and great service of transportation among the Seoul city.its really helpful for a budget traveler to move around the city quick and easy
"Fast, efficient, and clean","This subway system is far faster, cleaner, and more efficient than the subway systems of either Tokyo, Taipei, or New York. It is also very clean, and crine is very rare. Public transportation is something Korea does very well!"
Value card top-up machine at subway station,"Just wanna share to all foreigners visiting who cant understand korean lang pls do not top up value using 50,000won note for amount selection less than 10,000won. I did that and got my 50,000won stuck in the machine n have to get korean stranger to help me speak to the helpdesk. "
Great Metro,"Despite the complaints, Seoul Metro is world class!It is cheap and you can literally go almost everywhere.The cars are well ventilated and clean. Plus, the A/C is good.Just make sure that you avoid rush hours. You can get squished.With ""Hwanseung"" (transfer), things are so efficient and cheap! Unbelievable!A lot of stores have died but there are some still good stores in the subway area.Love the Metro! Hope many countries get effective Metro as Seoul :D"
Easy to follow,Seoul is well connected with the Metro At first I thought it won’t be possible to travel with the metro following the Korean instructions but then I learned the trick of buying the tickets then it was the best option to travel ANYWHERE in Seoul ManalOman
The best way of transportation in Seoul,"Taking the metro is by far the easiest way to get around Seoul. Also, the trains are airconditioned making the ride extra welcome on hot summer days. Getting a metro card is also a must."
No Seoul without Seoul metro,Seoul is so huge that in order to relocate you will have to use Seoul metro. It is so convenient as there's an application you can/have to download from Play market and viola you know exactly how to use this huge net of metro. The net is so wide that metro stations exit number varies between 6 to 25. But the best part is that no matter how complicated it may look it has signs and directions in English everywhere and also people are so friendly that they will render their help whenever you need it
the most effective public transport,"Easiest, fastest, and efficients way to move around the Seoul City. More easy if you use T-Money card. Many tourist attraction near the train station. Read the signage & you will be ok. Ride with no worries about traffic jammed & enjoy your visit there <3 "
Very Convenient,"It was very easy to find and you can download its app to see the routes and that is all. We did not have any problem using it, and even if you need help, then you can ask Koreans as they are very friendly and would more than happy to help you. "
CHEAT AND BEST WAY OF TRASPORTATION,I never ever seen such a nice and convenient way of transportation in so cheap rate. It has access to each and every corner of SEOUL CITY. Once you are used to metro's you can go any were in Seoul no guide is required. APPRECIATE the cleanliness they maintained in metro stations and inside trains.
Good system,"Great system, easy to use, staff at stations too very helpful. And lots of shopping and restaurants in the system"
Confusing ticketing system,The system is safe and easy to use apart from the ticketing system which is over complicated where you have to buy a ticket and have to insert it into a machine at the end of your journey to get a partial refund on your fare.
Okay,Metro station exits are somehow confusing especially if you can’t exit a certain line from a certain exit. Not always friendly to travel with luggage or elevator hard to find. Stop names aren’t well visible in the metro. Staff did not speak English well.
"use it, good Metro","For a tourist they are not so easy... we had a guide with us so it was no problems. They are fast, clean, so just go on it."
Convenient way to travel,"The Seoul Metro has an extensive network, which connects to almost the whole of Seoul. The stations and trains are very clean and well maintained.Some stations are very huge, and they lacked English signs, so it us some time to find the correct entrance to the platforms. "
Great location; lovely staff,"Metro is located in the heart of Myeongdong, where it’s non-stop shopping and good food. It’s right outside the subway station and also a taxi stand. The room is lovely with a comfortable bed, but these are not the best things about the hotel. The best part of Metro is her staff- all of her are helpful and polite, and I’d like to point out a security guard who was sweeping outside the hotel and he kept sweeping til the end of the road, and even cleared trash from outside other buildings. It was highly impressive because this is a civic-minded individual who truly respects and loves his job and company enough to do this. Oh and also the breakfast is decent, good clean food. There’s a Starbucks and 7-11 right in the building. Highly recommended!"
Amazing Subway,Seoul has the best subway I have ever ridden. It is air conditioned and spotless. Very easy to read maps and people in the stations who can help you navigate the system. Everyone in Seoul is friendly and eager to help visitors.
An Acceptable Mode of Transportation,"The Metro is an acceptable mode of transportation for tourists and citizens alike. It doesn't have a heads up display where you can view the station in English, only a board with lights, so it is difficult to see which station you are going to. Tickets are of reasonable price, the train gets you to the station fast enough but stairs is a problem."
Convenient unless...,"I always prefer travelling overground but in Seoul, where traffic could get really bad, the metro could be the best bet. However, when you have to transit between lines, be aware that you might have to walk quite a bit."
Simply the best,"Fast, cheap, efficient and safe - plus it goes literally everywhere! What else could you want from a public transit system?"
Main transportation,"Seoul Metro have several lines but quite easy to understand, even for a first timer.It's very convinience."
It’s okay but it’s no Tokyo or Hong Kong,"The good is that the trains are clean, spacious and get you from A to B. There are a number of downsides to the Seoul Metro when I compare it to Tokyo - few stations have air conditioning so it is VERY hot, there is a very long wait between trains which is unlike any other tube system I’ve been on, theres a lack of information boards so it’s hard to see how long it is to the next train, there’s a lot of stairs in stations and the elevators take an age for their door to close and start moving (extra time for disabled people apparently). Single use tickets are plastic cards and you have to pay 500 Won, on top of your ticket price, but you do get the deposit back from the machine just outside the ticket barriers. Interesting cabinets of gas masks are dotted throughout the stations which is interesting !!"
Easy to use and sprawling!,The metro is very convenient to use! We used it to get from the airport to our hotel and to get around the city! You pay a deposit for the one time use cards so make sure to redeem your card!
Seoul metro excellent service,The Seoul metro is very clean and comfortable. The best way to get around a busy city to avoid any traffic jams. Using the T money card is very convenient and easy; just touch the reader pad at the metro station entrance gate and again touch the pad at the station exit gate. A disadvantage is many stations have stairs so with heavy luggage it is difficult to access the trains. Lifts are available but not easy to find.
Convenient and safe,"For tickets, you have to use ticket machines but if you are not sure, ask people around, they will help you. Map is easy to find so if you had no problem in New York or Paris, I am sure you are not in trouble. Moreover, it is safe. Even after 9:00pm, you can take it alone without any problem."
Very good subway system,Seoul has one of the most comfortable subway systems I have ever seen. Tickets are easy to purchase and directions are described clearly so you can get to your target station. 
CONVENIENCE IN SEOUL ,"After several trips to Seoul for beauty products haul, this trip wanted to explore the other parts of Seoul from Gangnam, Insadong, Hongdae and others so decided to buy a top up metro card.Super convenient with all machine having English guide and going in and out are super efficient. Trains are clean and well maintained and covers the whole of Seoul. You can choose between per trip, top up card and tourist pass.I chose the top up card (3500 Korean won). Bought the pair KAKAO card (you keep the card and can be used in the future as you keep topping up. This is the cheapest and fastest form to get around Seoul.Safety in Korea is also extremely good which makes exploring fun and great."
Easy,We found the Seoul metro easy to use however access to elevators and escalators was sometimes limited. Many times we had to walk a good bit out of the way to find one. 
Good metro system but expects lots if stairs and walking,"The metro is efficient and well linked. And for someone who does not understand korean- no worries, as there are english and chinese words around that can guide you around. N it makes travelling easy too. Only downsides are the lack of escalators and as i was recovering from a leg injury, so it was quite tough for me."
"Easy to navigate, well priced, modern, clean, and safe!","Don't hesitate to use the Seoul Metro - it made traveling around Seoul incredibly easy for us. The only thing I'd say is that there are MANY stairs, so it's not the best for having a stroller or mobility issues. There are elevators, but it still could be a difficult system to navigate if you have mobility concerns. "
Fairly easy to negotiate,Use a tmoney card for slightly easier travel (you don't need to buy a ticket for each trip). These can be purchased at convenience stores. Perhaps ask your hotel to write in Korean on a piece of paper what you need.
Easiest and cheapest way to get around Seoul ,"This system makes transportation in Seoul easy. Recommendations: 1. Get a T-money card (connivence stores or kiosks around the station). Makes paying for transportation simple (also can be used at convenience stores, taxis and busses) 2. Download a app based Seoul map. Actually called Seoul or Kakometro. Just pay attention to the direction of travel of the train and Seoul is at your disposal. "
Best metro ever,"The Seoul metro is awesome. I stayed for 5 weeks in 2016 and I have never experienced a better one. Maybe Tokyo is up there too. It is silent, spacious and punctual. The tunes that plays before the trains arrive are really charming and very Korea :)"
Incredibly efficient,Super easy to use if you pick up a T-Money card from a convenience store. Just reload it and tap every time.
Outstanding and Reliable,"Safe, inexpensive, easy to navigate and a must for transiting Seoul and the surrounding areas. The entire infrastructure looks new, the trains/subway cars are modern and among the best I have used domestically (in the U.S.) and internationally. Signage is user-friendly and in Korean and English. Use the T-money card (reloadable) ... it can also he used in taxis. "
So easy ,"The metro is amazing. We no Korean language skills to speak of, we got everywhere we needed to be. The system is color coded and every station is numbered."
Very modern and fast - cash only ,"Price is also really good. The only problem for tourists is that you need cash for the ticket machine.But it is the fastest way to get from a to b in Seoul, don’t use taxi, take the metro!"
Easy and convenient to get around or get lost,"Great system, frequent trains, easy to access stations, convenient with the prepaid card that can be used throughout Korea. Be sure to purchase the youth cards for kids 18 and under. It would be nice if the metro maps available at the airports and the hotels are printed larger and more legible for ease of reference. Much needed in Korea since few speak English, and stations are not staffed. "
Use the Metro if you can,"If you take a little time to learn the subway system, you will be rewarded many times over. My sons took a taxi after the Metro map showed their route would take 30 minutes. The taxi took 45 as it turned out. And the cost was four times as much as the subway."
Good transportation,The seoul metro is very convinient and easy to understand. We can buy t money to get cheaper ticket fee
Clean & on Time Public Transportation,"Might be a bit packed when it is time for the locals to get off from work. The interval from one train to another is 3-5 minutes. And if you hungry, you can grab some snacks, there's a lot of food stall inside the train station. Some even got to shop various kind of things there like clothes, kpop idol pillowcase, cosmetics, etc"
Easy to use,Really easy to get around on. Be prepared to stand unless you have young children or older adults in your party where you'll usually be offered a seat. Signs are in English as well as the little tunes they use to signify a transfer station or the end of the line. It's cheap too!!Buses were quick to start and stop so be sure to hold on tight!!
Metro Ship system at Seoul New,"The basic is easy to use. Metro connects to all the famous tourist destinations in Seoul, in addition to metro, you should also combine the bus as well as cheap and convenient."
Get A Season Pass,Get a season pass if you staying more than 3 days. It's cheaper and it's convenient because it can be use for other mode of public transport and it's refundable at the end of your trip
"User friendly, excellent service","Seoul metro is very easy to use even for foreaigners who do not speak Korean. All instructions (to buy tickets, to connect to another line etc.) are also available in English. The names of the stations are given both in Korean and in English."
User Friendly,"Metro is easy to use. Lots of maps and signs to help you find the correct train. All signs and announcements are in English. My family, of four, purchased the tourist money card at the airport. One card gives you 20 rides per day for a set price. Not sure if it saves money but it's super convenient not to have to purchase single ride tickets every time. You also receive deposit back once the card is returned."
Good for getting around ,Seoul metro is the cleanest and simplest metro I've ever seen. I use the subway app which is perfect with the Transit money card. I don't have to constantly buy one way tickets.
Super Easy,So easy to use and figure out. All the signs and announcements are in English after Korean. The ticket machine also has an English option as well. Trains run frequently all day and the cars are air conditioned. Never had to walk far to my destination.
Best way to travel,"There are many modes of transport in Seoul but by far the best way is the metro.from the airport i took a taxi which cost me 77;000 wan,to myongdong.from there everything is within an army throw.i was at hotel Staz 1:a 5minute walk to myongdong main market,10,minutes to insadong and dangdemoun.namdemoun market another ten minutes,but to get to hong de and itewan I used the metro.best buy a t card from any 7/11 store which costs 2500 wan then top it up as you go along,I topped it up with 10,000 wan and it lasted 4 days.then it’s easier to just come and go as opposed to buying a ticket every time..the metro here is a little bit more complicated than shanghai,but still easy once you get the hang of it,just beware that there are many exits from any station you use so know which exit takes you where."
Convenient and inexpensive,Buy a subway card that you can recharge at any time instead of buying separate tickets all the time.
Seoul Metro,The most convenient mode of transport to get around in Seoul. A good option for tourists as it is easy to use & connects you to all the Tourist areas in Seoul. Fares start from around 1250KRW a trip if you use the T-Money card.
best,"It has improved alot since my last trip in 2010 to Korea. The subways are much cleaner, the announcements and signs are in English. Really the best way to get around the seoul metropolitan area and quickest"
very efficient,"very efficient, very clean, fast, all stations had very clear signboards in English and Korean language, transfers were clearly marked. loved travelling in the subway. "
Convenience way to everywhere,"Wide covered network, easy to ride to most popular view points.With clearly indication in each station in English. Clean and tidy compartment.Price reasonable."
A great way to get around a very busy city,I used the bus and train systems when in Seoul and they were great the T card system is perfect to help you also the trains are clean and come every couple of minutes.Just about most things are easy to get to by train.
Super efficient,"this is certainly the best way to get around the town. It takes a bit to find your way around, and most difficult part is to buy a ticket. But once you past that hurdle, it is very efficient."
Great transportation system!,Easy to navigate and a great way to explore the city! You can access most tourist attractions through the subway.
Better to avoid busy stations during rush hour,"This is the first vehicle to travel around in Seoul.Since lines have been expanded gradually, it may require walking long and deep downward sometimes.- Great view when it passes Han River.- Transfer stations and stations at office areas are so crowded during 07:00~09:00 and 18:00~. Sindorim, Gangnam, etc.- There are some stations with underground malls such as Gangnam and Express Bus Terminal.- Sinimun Station is still looking old.- Beotigogae Station has a funicular.- Noksapyeong Station is deep and gorgeous.- Some stations are changing names lately for reasons.- There are stations that are actually far from station names. Seoul University for instance.- Announcement in Korean, English, Japanese and Chinese."
Huge,Huge metro system which can basically take you anywhere...trains were clean and spacious (on a Saturday)...
superb metro,"NYC and Paris should hang their heads in shame. Clean bright carriages, clear announcements in the train including which side the platform will be on, clear labeling in stations including stating the next stop of the arriving train (so you don't have to follow the map to the final destination like ""direction""s in Paris). Also exit signs leading to clearly numbered station exits, and you can see the exit layout on GMaps to figure out the best way to go wherever you are going."
"The cheapest, fastest way to travel in Seoul","Seoul subway is the most reliable, fast and safe public transportation that i ever rode (same goes for the buses). The subway stations and the subway itself are always immaculate. Signs are in Korean and English. Some subway stations are like micro cities. They are huge and you can find a bit of everything there (restaurants, coffee shops, supermarkets, clothes and shoe shops to name a few) you will also find hot and cold vending machines in most of them. Each destination has a number and a color associated to it. Get a subway map. It will help you a lot.The metro stops are announced in Korean, English, Japanese and Chinese. You have WiFi inside the subway and air conditioned (during summer).The metro also goes way further from Seoul outskirts. If you plan to visit Suwon and you can't or don't want to drive, take the metro (around 1h. Stops everywhere.), or train (around 35 minutes.) or KTX (around 25 minutes). After that you hop on a bus that you will drop you at Suwon Fortress after a 15 minutes ride.It is also the main place where you will find some trash bins (you won't see any on the streets so always carry a bag with you). If you think you might be lost or you can't find the exit or any signs nearby, just look at the floor. In some places they have signs indicating which direction to follow for the exit or indicating the names of the area of the city you will be depending on the turn you choose to follow. (Check my photos for you to have an idea how they look like)You have ticket vending machines near every entrance. Get a T-money card, recharge it and go forth into adventure ;)"
Best transportation method in Seoul,"easy to read and buy ticket and cheap, since it has english and other languages. accessible basically anywhere you want to go."
Exceptionally clean and efficient,"We really enjoyed the cleanliness and efficiency of the Seoul Metro, which puts systems in western cities to shame. Although individual tickets get you where you need to go, we *highly* recommend purchasing a T-Money card if you're in town for more than 2 days. They're available for purchase at most convenience stores (we bought ours at 7-11) as well as in station service centers. Use your card to enter/exit fare gates, as well as for purchases in convenience stores and taxis. At the end of your stay, you can even get your card's balance refunded at a ""deposit refund device"" in the station!"
"Easy to pay, ask for directions","Easy to use the metro, but many different lines and you need to make sure you are going in the right direction, so check a map and if you are lucky you can find an English speaker to help"
"Wonderful, clean and on time",We used the Seoul subway on many occasions during our 3 day visit and found it to be an excellent system and cheap too. Some of the lines reach areas that are 100 kms from the capital.
Clean and on time,"Super clean metro, convenient, all the cars always on time, loved taking it around and also very easy to understand which is key when you are a foreigner and don't speak the language"
Cleanest metro I have seen,"Not only is the Seoul metro easy to navigate, it is also the cleanest cosmopolitan metro I have ever seen. Just know the names of the last stops to both directions on a metro line and you are set. All stations are also written and announced in English."
Very easy to use transit system,I found this system very easy to use and station staff spoke English and were always eager to help. I bough a card for the system at a 711. The signed are in English with maps that were easy to follow.
The Seoul network ;),It is a little complicated net of connections but there are many visual guides around to help. People are very supporting and always help to buy correct ticket to your destination. There are often many levels on station so on beginning you should check were the train is going ;)Stations are very nice and clean. The best option to move in Seoul.
not as easy as you would think,We used the metro to get around one day. it looks easier than it is. We asked lots of questions and finally got to were we wanted to be. The maps are easier than the trains themselves.
not bad,depends on the line but sometimes it gets crowded and some transfer stations have very very long walks and tons of stairs. but overall it is a good cheap way to travel. would give 5 stars if it didnt stop so early...
movig around from precint to another,"Some trains are good and quieter but others are noisy.Stations are not great places ... even though they are tidy but very drab looking.Signs, especially in English, need much improvement.... have to strain to look which station we are in, when in the train."
"So easy, so cheap!",LOVED this for my family of 6. It takes awhile to walk everywhere but it's a must in this huge city.
get everywhere,you can pretty much get to anywhere with the mix of K-rail and the metro system. there are signs in English 
Subway Perfection,Once you work out where you need to go the subway becomes an easy inexpensive way to move around Seoul and cities beyond. The numbers and colour coding are extremely easy to follow and the Korean Subway app is a useful addition. A few of the stations have markets in them too...worth a look. Topping up your travel card is simple....machines at every station with different language options available. This is a fast efficient and comfortable way to travel
Loken Clan in South Korea,The Seoul Metro system is excellent. Very reliable and on time. I look forward to ride the metro and get to my next destination.
So easy to navigate,"Actually I dont know whether i would have managed without the apps i used, but with travel apps like citymapper or rome2rio its supper easy. "
Counterintuitive metro system,Very extensive system. Can get you anywhere but is not the most user friendly system for tourists or non-locals. 
The name for efficiency,"My experience is very positive. As a first time visitor to Seoul, I had absolutely no problems finding my way around. Everything is well sign-posted and on time."
Such great value for money,"We picked up a loadable card from our local shop (in our hotel!) and it was so cheap to travel, we only re-loaded once.You can even get your depost back on your card when you leave - we did that at the airport! Really great, clean, quite and frequent trains."
"Clean , fast , efficient",Seoul subway metro rail is one of the most clean and efficient metro trains I've travelled by. There are ten lines and inter-connectivity is good. Stations are well maintained and the underground shopping is nice too.
Clean Subway,The Korean subway is more like Singapore MRT. The cleanliness in the train and even the toilet are the plus point of the Seoul Metro. Also the schedule of train is punctual and the maps for the subway is easy. The fee for traveling using subway is cheap rather than in other countries.
Convenient and clean,"Seoul metro is one of the most clean, quiet and fast metros I have ever used. You can get a single ride ticket to any place in Seoul, then get off and receive a reimburse of $500 won when you use the refund machine, or you can buy a card, charge it and recharge it as much as you want.The wagons are big, always clean, people is into their own business, stops are clear and in English and Korean, maps are everywhere so you can’t get lost that easily.Excellent way of transportation for tourists and locals."
The best subway,Seoul’s metro was designed by the French long time ago. The subway begins around 5:30am and ends around midnight depending your destination. The metro does not only travel in Seoul but travels to parts of gyeongdido and incheon. The subway is very clean and organized! Don’t worry about missing your station!! They announce the station in Korean and English! Some stations are announced in Japanese and Chinese too!!
easy to understand,Seoul Metro are a very helpful transport for foreign. easy to understand and quite cheap. it's easy to go from one area to another. you can use tourist card for metro that can give you a discount for several tourist attraction. Soul metro have several line but not as many as Tokyo Metro.
Really great,"It is clean, safe and convenient. It runs even after midnight with same price! How wonderful Metro system is~!!"
"Convenient, efficient, in English","The second best metro system after Tokyo. The metro can take you to almost anywhere in Seoul. Tips:1. Make sure to get a card and load it with money. You will save time and will be able to take the bus for free (free transfer). If not, you will pay TWICE!2. Try to avoid the rush hour time, it can get really packed. 3. Don't be overwhelmed by the garlic and alcohol smell at times. This is normal in Korea. 4. There are lots of basement restaurant, stores, and fast food outlets. Do try these places.5. Looking for a passport picture? This can be done in the metro too and it is cheap. 6. Keep the metro clean and do not talk loudly.The metro is safe and you will not have a problem. I have made it to 155 countries. I have an extensive blog at pinchetravels.com, if you want to read more about my travels."
Simple to use,Really convenient. the only thing is to bring cash with you and to remember to get your card reimbursement at the end of the trip. 
Sub-perb,Subway amazing as always. Nice and clean and easy to use once you ride a few times. The metro is also very inexpensive...you can travel all over Seoul for 10 days for avout 20 000₩
"Efficient, easy and overall nice","The system with clear signs is simple to learn, as well as the lines with numbered stations. Vending machines at stations are easy to operate, quite simple to add value on a travel card - which may not be shaped like a card. Trains vary from ultra modern to older versions. Worth taking the lines which cross the river, views are good. Changing lines may mean long walks and plenty of steps, and especially older stations have often quite hidden their elevators. Stations have all necessary and some unnecessary shops and booths. It is quite humorous to notice when you are the only passenger without your nose in your mobile - but it is also a way to keep feeling of privacy in a crowded space, like turning your face towards the wall/door when standing. Locals are very snappy to exchange seats when they see mother and child separated in a full car, just love it :)"
Convenient and Easy to Use,"Seoul Metro is one of the best subway systems that I have used. All signs were in Korean and English. All the subways lines, stations, and exits are numbered. I would definitely advise to get a T-Money card that works on both the Metro and bus systems. The card can also be used in convenient stores.If possible, try to avoid rush hour when the system gets quite crowded. It would also help if you plan your trip prior to using the system. Know which direction you want to go by looking at the end terminal station of the metro line. Most stations have multiple exits. There are maps in the stations of the local area around each station which I found handy."
a massive but accessible transport network,"Just like London, constructing a metro network in a city with hundred years of history is a very difficult task! When I first looked at the metro map, I gave up. However, if you got a metro map with Korean, your own language and the station number, you can go everywhere within Seoul."
Excellent technology non existent customer service!,I rate the cleanliness punctuality and overall travelling experience the best I have experienced. It beats Singapore on these points very slightly and is streets ahead of London. I have not used Paris recently to be fair by that Metro. It fails on the fact that there is no one at the gates to assist which seemed reasonable weekends but surprising weekdays. Funny messages popped up on the ticketing screens about line choices and the “I” button got someone who has zero English skills gabbling at the other end. No one turned up. On the plus side Korean people from a 75+ Lady to a young chap were ever so helpful going out of their way to help. Another great feature is that the exits of stations are strategically positioned on the 4/5/6 points of the roads. Very helpful. In some stations linking with other attractions walking only underground thru the mini shopping malls is a help to one.
"Very easy to use and travel around the city, however, if you have group of 4+ use taxi instead","Definitely the preferred way of travel in Seoul as the city can be confusing and the traffic may make taxi a less favorable option. I suggest using a Seoul Subway app to help you plot and navigate from point to point. Note not all the lines have interconnecting stations just because they intercept so beware, and even the stations that allows transferring of lines the walking distance may be substantial for elderly or family with small kids.I would say if you have family or group of 4 or more, then taxi may be an option. Seoul subway isn't too cheap. A taxi start off at 3000 won and unless you're really going out of town most places can be reached at 5000 won or less. I am traveling with family of 5 (2 kids, 1 infant no ticket) and I find myself even the shortest trip is 7500 won (after refund). For us taxi is actually the cheapest option for most of our destinations. But if you have group of 3 or less, then definitely subway."
Connecting everywhere,"Easy to connect, clean & convenient. It is always busy & but not confused. Look at the map & ask, locals are very nice & kind...."
Easy transportation throughout Seoul,"The trains were very clean and it really helps if you want to travel to different places in one day. The trains were also really cheap compared to where I am from and the best thing is that it doesn't really cost extra to change lines! But the seats were pretty hard so if you need to take a long trip and decide to sit for the whole train ride just be sure to get ready (although it wasn't that bad). Yes, the routes are confusing but during my whole trip I used the app ""Kakao Metro"" which literally saved my life."
a bit confuse of the route,a bit confuse of the route esp if i need to have line transfer. don't know which header way of my line. thank god that has apps and i have done it finally.
Seoul vacation,"Seoul metro is one of the cleanest subways I’ve seen. Despite the language barrier, we didn’t have difficulty navigating our way. We felt confident and safe taking the subway. "
Airport to Seúl downtown ,"If you travel around different places and countries and you need to save some money for other expenses yes this subway is the right decision because-is very easy to ride it , the price is cheap and you can take all your luggage without any problem, there are information in caracteres and English too, is clean and most of the stations have elevators and electrical stairs, you can buy easily your transportation card, the sights are very easy to understand "
Very elaborate and convenient,"Very convenient. Take the T Money card and use without paying cash at each usage. Very good and adequate information at all stations to commute easily. Reaches all major attractions and tourist spots in Seoul, even as further as two hours away on the outskirts. "
Convenient,"Its very easy to navigate around seoul with the Metro system that they have, its a good way to go around with a budget and also its a walking distance to malls or housing areas for easy access."
Best transportation system,"The metro subways and buses are so easy to use. Everything is color coded and they come like every 4 minutes so if you miss one no worry another will be by soon. We traveled using this mode for an entire week, i dont even use this back home in Los Angeles. You purchase the tourist prepaid transit card (TMoney) then load money on it. The card can be used for ALL modes of transport and like a credit card at certain stores. You get discount throughout the city when you show the card. It comes with a map to help you get around and a list of the stores where u can use it. The bus and subway are only a couple of bucks roundtrip."
Easy understandable and easy to get around!,Me and my family started using the subway on our first day in Seoul and we quickly learned how to get around using local transportation. Very easy to use with a T-money-card. The subway-trains feels spacious and ”safe” due to the glass-Wall/doors between the track/train and the platform. Everything is written in both english and korean which makes also makes it easy for foreigners :).
Efficient,"The Seoul Metro network is huge, cheap and very efficient. The only thing I didn't like was the signage in some stations that is a bit confusing."
Easy and Efficient,"Easy access, everything is written in English so there is no way to get lost if you know the transportation system. Bonus point: Wifi available pretty much everywhere"
One of the best transport systems in Asia,"On time, modern, spacious trains, WiFi available at stations on most lines. Easy to use as everything is in also available in English "
Easy to use,The Metro system is easy to use and inexpensive. Great way to get around town and see the sights! Highly recommended!
Efficient metro system,I counted about 10 different lines.It is a complex web that seem to be able to get you anywhere in Seoul. It's efficient and relatively clean- comparable to all the major city grid systems in the world.
Clean & Efficient,"We rode the subway for part of our adventure today & I can truly say it was a plesant experience. There was no trash laying anywhere on the trains, no graffiti & best of all no loud cell phone conversations. Everyone had earbuds to listen to whatever they were watching/playing on their phones. Stops were announced in English too. We loved it."
Maybe the best in the world,"The title says it all, clean clean and clean!Information everywhere, toilets everywhere and always CLEAN! Very safe as the trains' boarding areas are closed with barriers and boarding doors only open when the train has arrived.Wifi always working even underground.One of the best things of Seoul."
Very convenient ,Very convenient way to get around Seoul. Easier to navigate with the NAVER map or the KakaoMetro app. Otherwise would be a little confusing for tourist. 
Best metro I've been on,"Seoul Metro is fast, efficient, and inexpensive. It can get very crowded but people are very respectful. I like that everything is in English and Korean, which helped me tremendously as an anglophone tourist."
Best part f Seoul,"The metro is clean, very safe, fast, organized, reliable and cheap. After one day using the metro, we were able to get around the city fast and visit so many places without any problems."
Best subway,"the Seoul Metro is a marvel of the world, after using the system for more than 10 years, it’s still one of the best, clean, reliable, systems in the world, it can be crowded at time, for the uninitiated, it may take a trip to two to figure out. All signs are in English. Take note that some transfer stations to different lines can mean a long walk, also pay attention to exit numbers, many stations have many exits, some exits are far from another, so try to pinpoint where you going to get off the right exit"
Fast metro ,Maybe it wasn't as convenient as hk metro. But is sure also tourist friendly. Also the underground shopping mall is great if you are looking for a good deal in a cheap price. 
"Clean, Efficient and Straightforward to Navigate Gate","In June 2018 I visited Seoul, and South Korea has one of the cleanest and most well run public transit systems I have ever experienced. There are copious amounts of transit maps throughout all of the stations. Maps are in both Korean and English characters, and most additional signage and announcements are also in Japanese and Chinese. Important to note that these maps are NOT to scale, and when planning your route, remember that Namsan Park runs through the middle part of the city. If you do not have a Korean credit card, the cheapest way to ride the metro is to buy a T-money card at any local convenience store on to which you can load cash. The card costs 3,000 won (about $3 USD), but metro fare is cheaper when paying with a card than buying single rides. (I am not sure if there is an unlimited ride pricing option, but if you'll be using the metro quite a bit it could be a good idea to look into.) Base fare is 1,200 won, and further trips cost more. To use the system, tap your card upon entering and remember to tap it again before leaving the system. That is how the total fare is calculated. Note that the metro systems and buses in other cities use the same payment method with the T-money card, and it was very convenient as we traveled south to Busan and across the country. (Note: You do not need to tap out of the buses.) Stations are very organized, and each exit has a different number, making it very easy to follow directions or meet up with folks. Each subway car is numbered, and specific seats are put aside for elderly, disabled or pregnant passengers. (This designation is taken seriously, and young people did not sit there.) A little song plays as the subway car approaches and also at each station where passengers can transfer to another line. The subway connects to the KTX and AREX, so you can easily transfer to and from the airport and train and bus stations. Note that multiple lines have multiple different ending spots, and you may need to change tracks partway through ride. Locals and other visitors alike were very eager and willing to help if my partner and I looked confused in the station. Another plus: there are many restrooms in the metro stations (clean!), vending machines or snack vendor and sometimes even whole shopping areas. Note, there are almost NO public trashcans, so be prepared to carry your trash home with you. If you're visiting Seoul, if you want easy access to multiple metro lines, I highly recommend staying around the City and Jongno 3 stations. "
Metro in Seoul,"Seoul metro is comfortable. Its really big and it has lots of exit. There are big metro stations like Seoul Station or City Hall. Also there are small metro stations like Oido Station. There 8 or 9 lines. There are clean restrooms, some convenient stores and different shops or small cafes. Seul metrosunun kullanımı rahat. Bayağı büyük ve çok çıkışı var. İstasyonlarda temiz tuvaletler ve çeşitli mağazalar bulmak mümkün. Seul ziyaretçilerinin kullanabileceği en uygun ulaşım sistemi."
Well connected,"You don't have to worry about how will you reach some place in Seoul thanks to Seoul metro. It has covered the city extremely well. It is extremely clean, convenient, reasonable, well connected."
Metro,Very convenient. Only minus is that it didn't run all day all night and it finishes around midnight. Its also very cheap!
Clean and convenient," My mother and I took a lot of subway in Seoul in our 5 day visit. The subway is really convenient to get around. There are also designated seats for elderly, children and disabled, and I do see young people rather stading than taking those seats. The only down side is that we couldn't always find lift at the station. Some stations have escalator, but only up not down. With my mother's bad knee it was really not great. If you don't have stroller or wheelchair it is quite good.Overall, i think it's better than Japan's subway, but worse than Hong Kong's. Still far better than New York subway, which is a dump."
Seoul Subway,"Easy to navigate, clean and efficient. People are really respectful even in rush hour. Very quiet and warm seats. Download Subway Korea, i found it very useful."
Proud of Seoul,"I always appreciate Seoul Metro. There is no such good transportation anywhere in the world. It is very cheap, clean and comfortable. By metro we go anywhere in Seoul and Gyeonggi very easily and efficiently regardless of heavy traffic like hell and also can transter to public buses. The route is still expanding. How nice to hear that a automatic payment system will be introduced without tagging like highpass. If someone is not familiar with this, one can simply buy a transportation card and install a kind app. Free full 4G Wifi is available everywhere in the subway. On weekends, bicycles can be placed at the end."
"clean, good air-condition, easy trasportation","fast, clean, good air-conditioner, and easy trasportation. low price is addtion. It feels a litte bit old in Korea, but surely has good quality compared to other country ones."
Best way to get to any place in a huge and modern metropolis,A well commuting system high tech.You could get easy to any place Don't even think about - taxis could be hard becuase language barriers.In your next trip to Seoul just download Citymapper from your app store and enjoy traveling as quick as possible.
wonderful subway network,"the subway in seoul is great very vast, the rate is much cheaper than taxis, getting a t money card helps save a lot of time and effort. the trains are clean and fast. only thing i found strange was the trains are not constant there are times we waitied a good 5 minutes and other times even more..."
"Cheap, busy but efficient and easy to use","Greater Seoul sprawls to Incheon airport and houses about half of the country population (50 million). Yet Seoul’s comprehensive metro system with express trains on some of the lines (including line 9 that goes to Gimpo airport) makes it easy to get from A to B. Seoul metro is also cheap (standard fare is approx. 1 euro per journey (1250 KRW) + small supplements for extra distance). You need to buy a travel card from a machine - only cash. If you still have money left on your card, you can get it back - together with the cost of the card - by sticking the card in another machine. Trains are less frequent at week ends. Station names feature in Korean (Hangeul) and English. All stations are announced in 4 languages (Korean, Japanese, Chinese and English), so you need to be attentive. Finding the right exit might be trickier. Korean people are very helpful with lost tourists,so you can always expect someone will come to the rescue. Avoid rush hours, especially on line 3, because then the law of the jungle will apply."
Best way to travel,"Least expensive and best way to travel. There are maps for all languages. If you can't figure out the maps, many locals are willing to stop and help you. :) "
Perfect,"We have traveled the whole town with the subway - the only thing is that it was a bit too airconditioned, so on longer rides I was really freezing"
American friendly ,"I’ve taken the Seoul metro many time and found it to be very convenient and easy to navigate to anywhere you need to go, even when traveling by yourself. If you have an iPhone, you can down load a free app that is easy to follow."
Easy Way To Go Places,"The routes are color coded. Very easy to use. Be sure to ask for an English version of the subway map at the station, by the gates."
"Easy, clean and quick commute in Seoul",Great means to travel around Seoul. Signage in Korean and English. Inexpensive. Very clean. Very quick. Stations well distributed through city and close to major attractions.
Easy To Understand,The best way to travel. The instructions are clear. Just need to know your destination and you'll be fine...
Very convenient & quick transport,"I took airport express when I first arrived. But I took ordinary subway to airport when I left. And the time is just around 10-15min more. Besides, when we travelled around the city, unless you have to change the line, the travelling time is very short. Subway is highly recommended travelling means. "
Easy,"To to navigate and brings you to most of the popular locations without too much complications. The signs could be better for foreigners. Obviously the cheapest way to get around and made easier with map apps, especially NAVER."
I have to disagree...,"I'm no metro noob, having mastered the London underground, the New York Subway, the Moscow Metro, and Mexico City's metro among many others. Seoul's is inferior to all of these for a number of reasons, none of which have to do with language issues. For one thing, the stations are surprisingly FAR from anyplace you want to be. Wherever you're going, expect a good hike once you get out of the closest station. For whatever reason, that is not the case with these other very large cities.Whenever there's an interchange between lines, it is ridiculously far. By far the most massive walks between lines that I've ever encountered anywhere. All that translates to spending a lot of time getting from point A to Point B.Adding to the time factor is the stupid system of paying extra for your single ride ticket only to have to refund the deposit at the other end, leaving you with a bunch of unnecessary coins. Lines that run close to each other don't connect. Some lines run parallel in close proximity. And lines meander in inexplicable directions rather than running logically. I'm sure there's a logic to why they run where they run, but it really doesn't serve the traveler well. On the bright side, it's not that expensive (a little over $1 to ride), clean, air conditioned, not too crowded at most times, and exits are well marked."
Korea has a best transport system!!!,you can go any where in Seoul without any trouble with metro! You can also transfer to buses with a very small amount of charge! 서울은 전세계 어디에서도 볼 수없는 최고의 교통시스템을 갖추고 있습니다! 지하철과 버스 요금을 한번만 내면 30분이내 자유롭게 환승을 무료로 할 수 있습니다.
Clean and fast,Need more English signs for directions. A lot of stairs which is typical but inconvenient. Directions are confusing for visitor as well as locals.
The best subway system,"Free wifi, easy to understand communication for stops in multiple languages, app in English to make planning trips easier including transfers"
Easy to Use and clean,We used the metro every day. Easy to use and very clean. Best way to travel in Seoul. Even those who know absolutely no Korean.
Complicated metro system for tourists.,Tmoney card is not refundable when you leave Korea. It costs 4000won just for the card itself. You need to top up for your travel fares. Seoul Metro is not user friendly with limited english or chinese words on it. The staff sitting in i counter is not helpful as they dont speak english. You need to study the metro map by yourself the night before you travel. 
",etro skills","very lovely experiance with metro, you will see lovely views, but dont inter the metro after 5:30 - antil 7 Congestion time"
A must do in Seoul,"Although the metro directions and map is a little complicated for a foreigner and a first time Seoul visitor,yet its the best way for transportation in Seoul metropolitan area.you shoul be very careful not to make mistakes about the routes and directions.getting tickets is easily done at departures by automatic machines by cash."
Best public transportation in the world,"Trains are on time, clean, cheap to travel on and can get you most anywhere you want to go in Seoul."
Convenient and on time,If theres something I wish we had in PH is their subway system. It was maintained & cleaned.Convenient to go to different places. Easy to navigate.
Transportation in Seoul,"Most convenience way to travel in Seoul is by train. Just get your T money card at convenience store and start using it for train, buses and taxi. The actraction are able to be visited by all these mode of transportation."
"Easy, clean, cheap",Easily navigated by visitors with English or Chinese language skills. Signage is easy to grasp once you work out the train direction is described both by the next station and the station at the end of that line. 
Travel via Metro,Easy to travel on. Very clean. Passengers were very nice to us seniors by offering us their seats. WHAT we're NOT old!
Clean and neat,"Unlike what i saw on travel show that said the metro was confusing, i find it neat and easy to navigate. Highly recommended "
"Comprehensive, efficient, clean","As a non Korean speaker, I'm grateful the subway lines were in English and Japanese (which I have a strong working knowledge of). My only concern was that the subway stops around midnight. Thankfully my Citymapper app was able to provide information on buses to get to my final destination. I love how organized the subway exits are in relation to prominent destinations. "
Avoid rush hours,"Clean, well organized, connected everywhere in Seoul.But avoid rush hours. Otherwise you would feel like be a hamburger patty."
Convenient,The train stations are convenient to use. Very fast and easy to use. Everything is in Korean or English so its not hard to navigate. Easy to buy cards and put money on it as well. 
Best underground railway in the world (or at least in the places I've been),"While it took me a few minutes to work out the map and ticketing, once I did I found this underground system to be amazingly efficient and also cheap. The trains were very clean, spacious and regular. It couldn't be faulted."
One of the best,"Just don't understand way people drive here when its got the best public transportation system. Super efficient, cheap at about a buck and clean and stations everywhere, its the best way to get around Seoul. One drawback, it doesn't operate between midnight and 6am. Kinda a weird for a city that doesn't sleep. Tip: download Kakao Metro. "
Instrumental in getting around Seoul!,"Clean, convenient, and cheap! We bought the 72 hour pass available to foreigners, and it really paid off! We had 5 of us in our party, and used it all the time. It's super easy to navigate, all signs are in English, the trains were clean and on time and the stations were SPOTLESS. Highly recommend!"
Miss,One of best subway systems in the world. Easy to understand and use. Directions in English. Can be very busy. Most stop operating by midnight.
Well Connected,Well connected routes spread accross the city.. on time.. clean and spacious..The route numbers and colors help a lot for any one who doesn't read Korean 
Very convenience!,"The seoul metro is probably the most convenience way to travel for tourist whilst in Seoul, you can differentiate the route by the colours. You can buy and top up your card in any convenience store for a multi trip tickets and you can bring back home for souvenir, or you can buy one in the station if you want to buy a single trip ticket."
Efficient,"Its clean, cheap and safe, so not like London or Paris. If you've travelled in Japan its very similar except for one point which affected us and that's a complete lack of station staff. I'd gone through an automated ticket barrier however my wife's ticket didn't work so I was one side (with the money) she was on the other, a passing man did try to help but to no avail. Just as I was about go out and buy another pair of tickets a disabled man went through a swing gate and my wife snuck through with him. However when we arrived at our final destination she could not get out but we did find a fare adjustment machine which recognised where we had brought the ticket and that it was not validated, but it validated the ticket so she could get out."
Easy to use. But damn the stations are huge.,"Easy to follow subway map. Lots of English around so you can get by without knowing any korean. We used a subway app (Korea subway) to journey plan and it was pretty easy. So cheap as well to use. 1250 won for one way. Adds a bit extra if you transfer to a station that's further away but not much, few hundred up to 1000 if you go really far like to Everland.Frequent trains too so no waiting around. The longest we waited was for the Everline ( to Everland) because it was every 30mins a train and only one carriage because not many people use it. Still can get a seat even though only one carriage train! "
Excellent,Wow its truly amazing nothing can be better than this expirince worth all the money spent efficient to the fire
Easy transportation on time,Used the metro extensively while in Seoul and it was super reliable. always on time and never too crowded as a new train comes every 5 minutes. The signage in the stations are easy to understand as a foreigner. 
Fast and efficient means of transportation ,"Seoul's vast metro network makes traveling around the large megalopolis city easily. In the summer, the tunnels are very hot bit the cars are comfortably air conditioned."
lifeline of a tourist,"lived in myeongdong on vacation and had access to several metro lines. They are cheap, reliable, efficient with announcements in English as well and was the best way to get around the city unless your legs are tired. A tourist lifeline."
first review in years because Seoul Metro is amazing,"ive so far traveled to 95 countries and yes there are metro systems that are modern and recently constructed but for Seoul to have the sort of oversight to start with a metro framework that works so perfectly and efficiently even after explosive growth over the decades is truly impressive. i can confidently say this is the best metro system in the world of this scale. most metro systems reach a certain breaking point where all organization is thrown out the window but seoul's system is truly marvelous and is the lifeblood of this fast-paced city. i have lived in this city for 4 years and the metro with its efficient systems, well-mannered people and constant improving makes this an aspect of the city that needs more appreciation"
"Efficient and operational, wait for the electronic signs to turn English",It is much easier to get around the Seoul metro than it seems. Wait for the many electronic signs to turn English and everything can be worked out. But local passengers are also always willing to help if their English permits
Extremely efficient and safe,"As the title says, it's efficient, safe, inexpensive and the best way to get around the city as a visitor. Very tourist user friendly (English signage, helpful staffers). Easily the best mass transport system I have ever used."
Really easy,The metro in Seoul is really nice and easy to use it is both in Korean and English. You can buy the tickets outside and the menu is in different languages. You can buy a card to refill with cash ( you can use it to pay taxis and buses) or buy one for a single trip. They charge you a deposit of 500 when you use that card buy as soon as you exit there is a machine to give you your deposit. They charge you depending on your destination if it is less than 10k it is the standard charge but if is more far away the tariff changes.
Easy Peasy,"The metro is well marked in English. You can buy a transportation card, the cost of which is nonrefundable but any extra money you have on it at the end of your trip can be refunded. Or you can just pay for each trip with the new ticket. You pay a deposit for each ticket of 500 but at the end of the trip if you return the ticket you get your 500 back. Each stop has many different exits, so if you are meeting someone at a stop make sure you know the number of the exit. When you get down into the metroThere is a clearly marked line of stops so it is easy for you to figure out which side of the metro you need to get on to get to your destination. The metro is clean and the riders polite. The metro covers a lot of areas and tourist sites are marked in Korean and English."
"Fast, Clean and easy to use","Buying a ticket is easy and thanks to the good manners of the Korean people, getting on the trains is a calm experience.The maps are fairly easy to understand and the bigger stations are miniature shopping centres. One complaint - the seats are not too comfortable."
Easy for tourists,"Signs are clearly marked in English and all announcements are made in Korean, Japanese, Chinese and English.If you get lost, there is something wrong with you."
"Convenient, accessible and reliable mode of transport","In Korea, T Money card is used as the transportation card. It can be easily topped up at the machine at each station. The metro station in Korea is very convenient to travel to most places. "
So amazing,"The Metro in Seoul is very amazing. You can easily get lost, so be sure to have an app to use it. Any time you get a ticket you pay a deposit that you get back at the end of the trip. Very convenient to visit Seoul."
A torture for people with bad knee,"We were there for my birthday trip in May. The metro lines are comprehensive but not user-friendly when it comes to exiting the area. Most of the stations doesn't have escalators or lifts to the ground level. You have to be literally climbing stairs after stairs after stairs (most of them starts from basement 5)..... most stations are clean but outdated in terms of structure, looks and stench with urine-smell and from rubbish bins and etc. My operated-knee was suffering after the 2nd day. "
Faster than travelling by taxi,"Cheap and fast but it can be confusing at first because of the numerous transfers. Make sure you snap a photo of the subway lines for ease of travelling. While transfers are made easier if you go by colour, it can be confusing when you have to decide if you should be travelling on this side or the opposite side of the platform. Long walks if you go to the wrong/opposite platform."
Fast and Efficient,"Okay it takes time to figure out that the printed cards can only be bought using cash and you get a deposit back but they are cheaper than the multi use card if you are only taking 10 or so trips.after that it's smooth sailing, the trains are fast, clean and come often.A super easy way to get around."
Excellent way to travel around Seoul,"If you like to visit several places, you can buy a stored value ticket and use the metro to travel around. The stations are conveniently located. The trains are punctual and well maintained. The route is easy to find - there are English & Korean words. Announcements on board the train also have English language. The main considerations are steps and walking. There are a lot of stairs and escalators (or you have to look for the elevators). When you change train, you may have to walk quite a bit to the next line. Of course, this provides a healthy exercise. Besides, there are underground shops in and around the stations. "
Best way to travel around the city,Friendly young subway 'ambassadors' are there to assist tourists with purchasing tickets and directions... Inexpensive way to travel around Seoul
You can get practically anywhere in Seoul by metro(subway).,The Seoul Metro or Korail is one of the most practical public transportation in Seoul. You can get to anywhere in Seoul and the vicinities. It’s average speed is 50km/h.
Got many lines that connect you,There were confusing at first coz of many lines that interconnecting each other but after you familiar with it then it gets easy to get around. Metro are not so busy but waiting time sometimes quite long like 5 minutes. But it gets you where you want to go
Seoul Metro,"The best way to get in and out of Seoul is by metro since i dont yet the bus routes. But beware of the splitting subway lines, there were times i thought it would be a straight journey esp going to Bupyeong area rather it goes to Sinchang the othe end of the subway. It cost 1250won for a sinle travel plus the metro card worth 3000won (not refundable) so we can save money by just reloading. I guess there will additional 100 up to 300 tranferring to other lines. I regretted using limo taxi from airport to Seollung,as it was too expensive $110 plus the driver is asking for more, since i dont know Seoul yet when we arrived. We saved money by using metro going back to airport, i think only 1500won (1.5$) each from Bupyeong area and it was a lot faster."
Efficient but sometimes confusing ,"Extensive metro network, and not as crowded as some other major cities even during rush hours. Efficient, generally clean and gets the job done. Note however that not all trains have functional English announcement (voice or video) so it pays to keep track of where you are instead of fixing office. Lots of exits for each station, and most stations will require negotiating flights of staircases. "
"Safe, affordable, clean","Its convenient, clean, affordable and safe. Only thing is the STAIRS!!! About 80% of stations do not have elevators. Lifts are mainly only for the needy and you get judged if you take the lift. We had such a hard time with our huge luggages. If you get off the wrong stop, transferring and finding the right platform can be quite complicated especially for tourists. Also, stations are often huge, so allocate ample time for your travel."
Awesome Transportation ,"Seoul is the most convenient place to travel in. It's safe and easy. We used Naver App to navigate our way around. This included the train and buses options. We enjoyed taking the Metro, specially with LTE wifi, even underground. "
Korean metro for the elderly,"The first day we traveled by the metro, we discovered that the elderly, even foreigners, can use it for free. In the payment machine, there is an option ""Complementary"" for the elderly. It requires a password. Tell the station attendant that you are 65. He will type in the password and you have to pay 500 won for one trip (about $0.5). On the way out of the metro, you insert you card in another machine and get back your 500 won."
The best and easy ,From the Incheon airport you can take express train to Seoul main station than from here you can take Metro every in the city very convenient and fast and very clean and safe too 
Awesome experience,One of the best metros in world. Really amazing experience & fun especially during rains. Will love to visit again.
Seoul to Incheon airport,"Inexpensive, comfortable and faster than a car. Depot area well marked and easy to navigate. Recommended. "
Colorful Lines,"Transportation is very easy at Seoul. Just make sure you have your T-Card loaded and download an offline map of their metro. For those who don't have their TCard, there's a vending machine at the Station where you can buy/load.Note:TCard prices vary based on their design...Trains runs in a number of colorful lines (at least 9) but don't get overwhelmed. There's translation of the train's destination on the platform. Once you find which Line/Color you'll be travelling, check both ends of that line so you'll know the train's direction/platform. You can enter any car since there's no separate one for male/female. Special seats are reserved for elderly on each car. If you need to transfer to another Line/Color,don't tap out.Just look for the arrow indicating where to transfer, otherwise, your TCard will be deducted. If you have your luggage/trolly, there's a special gate where you can tap and exit smoothly. Station officers are also very attentive to assist. Seoul subway have at least 6 exits so make sure to check your destination to save time.=). "
efficient,"its pretty on time, just that if you are disabled? prepare to hunt for elevators, they are usually hidden"
Gets you everywhere in the city,"Very comprehensive guide maps at the stations. Gets you everywhere in the city. But could be very busy during peak hours. Also, transferring from one line to another requires a lot of walking...up and down stairs...with escalators only at small sections. Good workout if you're into the 10,000 steps a day routine. Not good if you have a problem with your knees"
Cheap. Clean. Efficient. Fast.,Absolutely great transit system. It goes everywhere in the city and suburbs. It is easy to use and English friendly. The stops are clearly indicated and announced in advance. The stations are clean and very easy to navigate. The connections are easy to find and get to. The base fare is 1250KRW and any surcharge is charged when you scan your card to exit your destination-station. 
"Fast, efficient, English friendly and pretty cheap","One of the better metro systems I’ve used around the world. Although their metro is huge, it’s fairly easy for English speakers to navigate. Seemed like you could wander the city in any direction for ten minutes and you would find a station entry."
Feet of Seoul 서울의 발,"서울에 어디든 가고 싶다면 지하철응 이용해서 가보세요. 빠르고 저렴하게 움직일 수 있습니다. 상대적으로 저렴한 요금또한 장점입니다.T-money card is ESSENTIAL!!If you want to go wherever in seoul, you can go anywhere by subway. Subway’s fare is KRW 1,300 about USD a dollar 20 cents. It also offers you to transfer to bus with add transfer fare KRW 50~200 in 30 minutes. So if you pay about KRW 30,000 you can enjoy seoul trip with public transportation. If you don’t have wireless service don’t worry about it. Wherever any subway stations and subway cars offer FREE WiFi. Some stations have Convinience stores, stores, bakery stores, small restaurants and cafes. In summer, it operate air-conditioned car and in winter, heater car. Finally, all of subway station operate free restroom/washrooms."
Best way to get around.,"Clean, efficient, and cheap. Takes you anywhere and everywhere you want to go. Unless you want to take the bus so you can look out the window, it's the best way to get around Seoul.Tip: download the app for your phone. It works very well.Note: The metro can get crazy crowded. You may get bumped. Do not sit in the pink seat unless you are a pregnant woman. Avoid the handicapped/elderly seats or be prepared to give it up to someone. "
Punctual!,"Great way to quickly travel through Seoul.Subway is clean, fast and on time.T money card system works great."
Revisiting,"This trip I took more of the Metro System as I have retired and doing more sightseeing. Coming from Singapore where MRT system experience frequent stoppages due to ineffective management, the Seoul Metro was a breeze and great.If only Singapore can learn from experienced folks rather than think it has Military Generals who can be helicopter in to fix the problem. Indeed I think it got worst."
Kakao metro app,"big subway system. for a best experience, I recommend Kakao Metro app (also has Busan subway map and other cities)"
Best way to move aorund in Seoul,"It´s very convenient. fast, works all night, you don´t have to wait to long for the next train, aircon is always fresh (you will know what I´m talking about if you visit the city in summer)."
Lifeline in Seoul,"Extensive network coverage, efficient service and clean trains are the highlight of the metro. It is like the lifeline in Seoul connecting every part of the city with each other. The fares are pretty cheap and the tickets are easy to buy. Highly recommend for a quick transport."
"Very clean, well organized and on time","During our 5 days stay in Seoul we used the metro every day as it is the fastest and most convenient way to travel in Seoul (beside of walking). The ticket machines only accept cash and no cards, so always keep some coins with you. After using the ticket and leaving the station you find some refund machines where you get a refund for the metro card."
"Extensive, Convienent","I have traveled to many cites around the world. This is one of the better metros. Extensive routes. Easy to use, once you get yourself oriented to the map. Recommend getting a T money card (tap and go) from a convenient store (which is on every block) and top off in small amounts as you go."
Clean. Organized. ,"I really like Seoul metro and subway. They are clean, have easy-to-follow directions and are really tourist friendly. It’s not complicated. People actually respect ways that are put in place that make it organized. "
Wish We Had This at Home!,"If you want a cheap, efficient and clean way to travel, make use of the Seoul subways. There are nine private lines which enable a person to travel long distances cheaply and quickly. Each subway door is marked on the platform to enable a person to choose the correct exit. Presto cards are used to enter and exit the subway. Machines to refill your cards are at each entrance/exit. As well, these cards can be used to pay for taxis and buss. Wi-fi is available on all subways."
Impressed with Seoul Metro Service!!!,"Kudos to Seoul Metro for a very efficient, on time, and stress free travel within Seoul Metropolis Area. It's the best metro experience I've ever had in my life!!! I could simply say a WOW!!!"
Efficient and cheap!,"We travelled via the subway in Seoul we used our t money card and it is efficient, clean and cheap way to travel . Although if you have luggage it has many stairs?"
Come everywhere in Seoel,"The metro in Seoel transport you throughout the city.However it takes time to to feel comfortabel. You can buy daycards as foreigner. Also you can buy cards for single trio’s. The tarif starts from 1200 won.You will get a card for the trip wich cost 500 won.Afterwards you put the card in a machine and you get the 500 won back.A daycard cost 10.000 won.The distantie to visit some arena is great, so take the metro"
Clean fast and efficient,It’s not the cheapest metro system at KRW 1250 per ride but it takes you to many important places and connects to the KTX via Yongsan or Seoul seamlessly.We took the metro everyday and did not have any issues. Buying a T card makes it very hassle free too.
Extensive train/subway network in Seoul,"Trains are very clean and covers a very wide area. Stations are easy to access. Changing train lines can be an experience as it may be a 5 minute walk from one platform to the next. However, the lines and direction are clearly marked in English and easy to follow. Frequecy is about every 5 minutes. If you are in Seoul for more than 3 days and plan to use the trains, it is well worth buying the T-Money travel card. Very convenient. Overall, the trains were excellent and very cheap. "
Subway,It's very convenient to travel if your hotel is near the station.Very clean.The only disadvantage is there are lots of steps to go up and down.Not all station has lift or escalator.Problem for elderly and people having knee problem.Hope they will look into itCheers!
"Clean, and on time","One of the joys of Seoul is its subway system. It's almost always on time, clean, wide, and phone/internet network works throughout. Download one of the apps to plan your journey: the best exit/nearest door to interchange is also indicated."
easy and comfort connect,"easy and comfortable to connect various routes and stations around the city, fair cost of journey and best to connect to Inchon airport."
Best transit system,This is really the best transit system in the world. Can go everywhere in subway or bus with very cheap fare using T money.
"Excellent and easy way to get around, if you are willing to walk a little",Get a reloadable card (instead of single use ticket which will cost you more). It is a lot more convenient. Get to learn the subway lines and transfer points. It is easy to get around.Don't forget to return your single use ticket to the kiosk to get your 500 won deposit back.
Seoul is big,"We bought our passes from 7/11 that had cute Line Friends characters on it. Easy to take however some connecting stations are a bit of a walk to transfer. The subways are not as efficient as other South East Asia, but coming from Sydney's railway system , I can't complain. Easily can reload and return at any station. Most trips cost about 1500won return "
Amazing! ,"First visit to Seoul and I used the metro an awful lot! So convenient, clean and never overly crowded. Easy to navigate after a very short time. Very fairly priced. Every country needs a subway system like this! "
One of the Worlds best Metro System,"Having been in Korea numerous times over the years, the Metro system in Seoul is one of the best I have ever experience, everything is color or number coded and even translated to English if you want to go that route. The cost is very reasonable and links to just about every neighborhood in Seoul and surrounding areas. just don't block the doorways or crowd seat, you will find yourself either pushed out the way or scolded. Lines and trains are always improving with very few older models out on tracks."
Best transport option ,We took the Metro from the airport to city centre and back and forth. It was a perfect transportation option for us - very easy and convenient. I can recommend. 
convenient & easy to use,"Payment are easy by using T-money card, and there's also mobile app. available to get information about which train/line to take to go to any station, price information, and timetable.It's relatively cheap, clean, and fast.The only downside is the availability of elevators in the stations. It's difficult especially when you're carrying heavy luggage."
Efficient,"It's extensive, and if you need to go somewhere, you can get there, if you have enough patience. Sometimes crowded, but that's to be expected."
Requires one trip to get used to...,"Convenient that there is a station almost every major block in the city. The line numbers and station numbers help to know where you are even if you don't know Hungul; however, the locals don't know or use the station numbers so sometime it was tricky to get on the same page when asking which station to use."
It's reliable public transport service....easy to take it with T-Money Card.,Right time service... Easy to take for any tourists... We took it with T-money card that can be bought from any convenience stores....
This thing is enormous!,"Seoul metro is enormous in size, and may be extremely confusing. You can spend more than two hours traveling between two destinations. Line #1 itself is the longest in the world, about 200km in length! Some lines have express trains, which won't stop at some stations, to speed up transportation. It is truly a marvel of transportation engineering."
USE THE APP,"Seoul’s metro works amazingly and will take you anywhere without any problem BUT please please please use the apps that help you navigate, the stations and the amount of people might make you get lost!"
Clear direction,Seoul metro has clear direction in English. Ticket machine also has English direction. Some stations are crowded.
Amazing ,"Honestly, it’s really just amazing how clean and efficient this system is. I’m from NYC so this was the cleanest thing I had ever seen. The trains are so fast and on time, and I don’t recall ever seeing trash around. Like any city that isn’t NYC, the trains don’t run 24/7 but the quality is still superior. All the signs are also in English and the maps are actually quite thorough and obvious, even if English isn’t that easy for you. The maps inside the trains even tell you what side the doors open on at each stop! AMAZINGLY CONVENIENT. The fares run by distance, so you tap in and out of the stations, but it’s still really affordable. The metro card also works in Busan, and I think some other cities as well. Busan metro was also excellent. I don’t recall if I saw the woman-only train carts in Seoul, but I definitely saw them in Busan (woman only during a specific time of the night, for their safety). At one point I did have an issue tapping out of a train station but there’s a call service button at the end of the turnstiles, and after hitting it and explaining through the intercom that I did not speak Korean and was very confused, they just beeped me through. I never saw the worker, but I guess all is well that ends well. The machines you use to add money to the metro cards also work in english so fear not. And even if you do get confused you’re bound to be approached by a station worker or passerby to offer assistance. There’s also a subway app (Subway Korea) that you can use to plan routes and fares with real-time directions and timetables (it also works for Busan and some other cities)."
Extremely efficient and convenient,"The Seoul Metro is widely used by both the locals and the tourists. This is because it is an extremely easy, convenient and efficient means of transportation. And it isn't just the train and/or the train's timetable. The infrastructure of the stations also make it easy for handicapped and elderly persons to get around on their own as there are elevators at nearly every station. All the stops are labelled in both English and Hanguk (Korean) so it's easy for us foreigners as well. But just like many major cities, it gets really crowded during peak hours. Operating hours are between 5am and 12am (midnight) though this might change depending on the station. "
Great way to get around,"What to say? efficient, clean, fast, friendly staff....great way to get around the city at a good price."
Smooth Seoul Metro ,One must get a T card before using Metro T card can even be used in bus taxi and Metro. When you have finished using the card the balance can be refunded after taking a certain service chargeThe Metro is quite easy to use One can follow maps. Line swapping is also easy and well demonstrated. Announcements are made in English and Korean before each stop The trains are very clean. Stations and washrooms also very clean. People are disciplined and get on and off the train peacefully. The locals are always ready to guide you. The only problem using the Metro are the stairs. They are huge. Senior citizens and people with health issues find it difficult to climb. Even if one has luggage it is difficult to carry. Elevators are far and do not always reach the correct exit. Taxis are advisable and readily available for senior citizens 
Easy and convenient way to get around the city,"After buying a travel card and loading it for the time we were in Seoul, we had easy and reasonably priced way to get around the city. The Stations are clean and well signed which included English. Trains are clean but can be crowded. f you are elderly do not expect the youth to provide you a seat even if they are in delegated seating for elderly. My only negative. Strongly recommend this for city travel."
Good,The subway is much faster than the buses especially for long distances. But be prepared for a lot of stairs if you transfer. We had trouble with directions as not all stations have English maps available and our cellphone wasn't always get the greatest signals to help us. 
Main transportation in seoul,Cover most route in seoul and dont forget your tmoney for use this transportation.Very crowded on rush hour
"So clean, cheap, easy to use","We took the Metro from Gimpo to our hotel. So clean, cheap and easy. One transfer. No problem. Get the T card and load some money on to it. Makes it a little cheaper and much faster to go thru. You can get a refund on any unspent money on the card. I wish our Chicago El (Metro) was half as nice!"
Very interesting ,I took the metro from itaewon to Gangnam for the first time. It took a bit but I got the hang of all of the transfers and which lines to get on. It was cool new way to travel for me. It got a little crowded at times but I guess that is expected ha. 
Very convenient!!!,"It's my third time in Seoul, but it was my first time to ride their subway station. I was really impressed, it's so easy to use. English is widely available on their maps and in every stop they announced the location in Korean, in Chinese and in English. It's one of the cheapest means to go around the city beside the bus of course. "
Not tourist friendly ,It is very hard to find elevators in the metro. Not recommended for travelers who have a lot and heavy luggages to use this transportation to get into the city
Possibly the best for a foreigner,We highly recommend getting passes as it works out much cheaper than cash. If you don't then remember to recycle your card in the machines which pay you your 500won deposit back. Also the lines all connect somewhere and it's so much better than a bus especially because in our situation buses were taking significantly longer times then stipulated by Google maps. This is a foreign mans saviour if you're a tourist in korea and it's extremely easy to use.
Save your feet if your planing on seeing this big city properly!,"The only way to zip around the city and save your feet. Clean trains, regular service and good value at W1250 for most city trips, W1350 for Gangnam area. Stick with the single use tickets if you are in the city for only a few days. The fare is only W100 extra and you can get the W500 card deposit back at the end of the journey easily when you locate the deposit machine! The T card saves some hassle as you can load it up and saves you buying tickets and getting deposits back, but at W3000 for the card (non-refundable we found out later!), you need a lot of trips to get value out of it and the discounts you get with the card are minimal now."
Great,"As someone who came from country that doesn't own subway, Seoul metro is always amaze me everytime I use it.There are lines that connect to each other destination.You can pay with t money and the top up machine are everywhere beside the subway entrance. "
Subway in korea,Subway korea metro. Incheon to seoul is amazing. Korea is country the best. Fast transportation yeayyy
Easy to understand and operate,"Wouldn’t try it if the taxi driver wasn’t asking 70,000 won fare from Myeondong to Hongdae lol! Tourist have to be smart and know the price of everything (most of it) coz some are testing if you will fall from it. Tanx to my accommodation host for guiding us, detail by detail, we managed to get back to his place safe and not to mention saved alot. There metro is easy to understand, they have different language that you can choose, and there are english signs everywhere, there’s no way you will get lost."
Easy to get around,"Ever since I start travelling to another country I always preferred to use subway. I’m a type of person, if the country has good climate, clean and organised, and safe, I’m down to use public transportation. Plus challenging because you get to see how far you can go using thing that you do not know. And cabs are always easy to find, anywhere. I want to have the option for “what if”.(“What if:” there’s no cab, or I need to get there on time and it’s traffic?” Or I’m on a budget I don’t like to use cab because it’s expensive.)All of these answered by a subway. You just have to download Seoul and busan subway map. (If you just plan to go to busan) or vice versa. Plus here’s the reason why I chose this transportation:1. It’s cost efficient2. Less hassle3. Easy to navigate4. Fast5. ReliableI don’t opt to use bus for most of my travels because I have dizziness every time I used that kind of transportation. I don’t like taking anti-vertigo tablet because the side effect is I’m sleepy. ( not good for touring) but if you prefer the bus its near to every subways stations. Specially here in Seoul, I recommend using subway, if you want to maximise your stay in Korea. Use them. It’s no traffic, of course unlike taking a bus. Plus transferring to color pattern stations is way too far if you use buses. Literally you count kilometers, specially on rush hour day. Buying a T-money card is advisable if you stay in Seoul for more than 2 days, you get discount instead of buying per day ticket. Plus you can use this card to almost anywhere, from subway to bus, to some of the taxis, to busan metro/subway, convenience stores. We got ours from convenient store located in subway airport. Please do note that some of the designs are in need to be activate at the information booth even when you top it up (load-up) That what happens to us, when we bought the “line friends” T-money card, (yes I’m a fan!) Well, even though the staffs at convenient store tried their best to help us, walked with us all the way thru entry gate, it did not push through, they ask help thru “help button” at subway but I just don’t know why it didn’t work. So I decided to go to information, and that’s it, all it needs is to scan our cards and we’re good to go. Also design cards is a 1,000 - 2,000 won higher than classic ones. Be mindful. I bought ours for 4,000.00 won/each (no top up) Classics designs is the violet card. My son lost his first t-money, so I bought a new one, I just accidentally picked this one because we are in a hurry taking a subway, that time is already 11:30pm/ subway is until 12am. Anyway bought it for 3,000.00 won/plus top up. And need not to be activated since it’s automatic. I think k-pop designs are much higher depends on in-demand group. "
"Fast, on time, and clean","Seoul’s metro system is extensive throughout the greater Seoul metro area. It’s very fast and on time. Take note of the signs (with pictures) that label seats designated for elderly, disabled, and pregnant. Do yourself a favor and buy a reusable card."
Easy to use,"The Seoul subway system is clean, cheap, reliable, safe, and easy to use. Be sure to download and use their app for an easy way to get around town. "
Great coverage but needs escalators.,"The metro gives terrific coverage of Seoul and the surrounding areas, with frequent trains. Very clean cars and stations, but in bad need of many more escalators/elevators."
Seoul has the best most comprehensive Metro! ,"I've been to and ridden subways in London, Paris, Rome, Athens, Amsterdam, New York, DC, Boston, LA, Beijing, Hong Kong, Bangkok and others and I've never ridden a cleaner, more compehensive, more efficient or easy metro system.The arrows and signage could be a little clearer, but it's a piece of cake!"
Efficient and Clean Metro,Great way to get around Seoul. Just remember most trains stop running around midnight. Helpful and courteous information staff. Easy for foreigners. 
Average metro in Asia,"I see the really high scores on other reviews and I wonder what this metro system has tht you can't find in Singapore and Hong Kong (which I find superior). It doesn't come as often, to change lines you have to walk quite a bit and to find one from the city is not that easy."
The best way to get around in Seoul,"Seoul Metro is a great way to get around the city, once you get used to it. Buy a travel pass at Inchon airport which will give you the best deal. If you don’t do this, the next option is to buy a pass in the metro for 3,000 KRW and then load it with your travel funds. I started with 10,000 KRW and then toppled it up as necessary. The tickets can be used on the metro or the bus service, although the metro is much quicker. Get a free metro map from your hotel or the station itself. The metro does take a little getting used to and can sometimes be a little confusing. Once you have identified the station of the line you need, then it’s a simple case of following the route and the connections. The confusing part is that the direction you need to head in is often posted as the next station on the line. When you think you are at the right line and junction, double check above the train doors that the next stop is the one that is heading in the direction you need. Once you get the hang of it, it’s a breeze. "
Easy,Easy and most convenient choice to get around in Seoul. Cheap fare and no traffic issues. Subway train comes every ~6mins. 
Clean and value for money,On our first time to take the subway we had difficulty in figuring out where we wanted to go. But become easy after we’ve been using it for the rest of our stay. We bought T- money card to save time in buying one time ticket. Its clean and most of the time not crowded. You can see some Under ground shopping centers also around. 
Easy to use and not expensive,We used the Metro a lot and found it easy to follow and not that difficult to pay. We just showed the brochure of where we were going to and the bus driver told us how much.  
Great way to get around,We had a 48h Discover Seoul pass which gave us unlimited use of the metro station. It was fairly easy to get around as long as you had an idea of which lines you needed to get to. We usually just followed the coloured signs to get to the right platform. Try to remember the station name after the one you are on so you can figure out which train to take and if you're going in the right direction. Most of the stations have small underground malls nearby which has places to buy souvenirs or food.
Very efficient and cheap!,"Your best way of travelling in Seoul... If you have a cell contract with a provider, you'll have free Wi-Fi.... its cheap, easy, efficient, clean and affordable.... Plus bathrooms everywhere! "
Convenient,"Definitely a convenient and easiest means of transport. Not only the lines and the rail system. You can basically get to anywhere in Seoul. they even have apps which even the locals are using. The app is super and absolutely convenient with station to transfer, price and time taken to reach your destination. Becareful of where you are sitting, there are special seats for pregnant women, the elder and the disable so that we are not causing any inconveniences. Expect huge crowds and passengers running to catch the trains during peak hours. "
Amazing Metro System!,A lot of signs are everywhere! You can easily find your way! And it's very cheap! Train comes music is our favorite ;)
Very Good Train System,"Even though most signs are in Korean, but all important and necessary informations are in English.Very systematic.Very clean and well maintained.Many different metro lines were interlinked excellently. Only flaw, frequency of trains should be higher."
Easy Riding,The Korean Metro is very convenient and low cost. The train displays all stops in Korean and English and it’s very easy to navigate the city on clean and air conditioned train cars. 
Seriously misleading signs,"I have used the metro system in various countries: Northern Europe, Hong Kong, Singapore, or even Malaysia and Thailand. I have to say that it requires my best skill to survive the Seoul Metro. The complexed map is not the problem. The real problem is the SIGNS indicating DIRECTIONS. Firstly, you cannot trust them. If you follow them, you have 50% chance of going the wrong way. The more reliable way is to have the station map in your head (i.e., which floor is for which line). Secondly, it is not designed to be understood intuitively. And last, it is quite not friendly for English users. "
Efficient & expansive network,"The subway system is easy to use. Even though I cannot read Hanji, I could understand the subway stations on the bus routes to figure out the connections via Google Maps. The subways & buses have Korean & English announcements before each stop."
Easy to navigate,"It's qutie easy to take the metro in Seoul and you can easily access to anywhere by metro. My friend recommend an apps (Subway) on phone that make it much easier. You can input the depart and arrive station and it'll tell you how you can get there from the shortest line.The only thing bad about taking metro is the stairs, you can't really find escalator or lift. My mum's legs are not too strong to take the stairs but most of the entrance/exit are only with stairs. Even you can find the escalator or lift, it might take a big route for you to get to the place you are going as the exit are not the nearest to your destination.Those who are bringing elderly that are not able to take the stairs, I would suggest to take taxi as it's not too expensive if you have a party of 4 and the distance is not too far. Sometimes taking taxi will be even cheaper as compare to taking metro."
Great Connectivity,I jsut used it twice but it was really on time and easy access to all lines from the main station. It was on time and easy access
Take the Metro!!,"As a New Yorker, I have HUGE subway-envy! Can the people that run this metro please move to New York City and transform our horrible transit system? Please?? This metro is easy to use and SO CLEAN!! The trains are clean, the stations are clean and yes, the bathrooms are clean!! Clean bathrooms at every station! Seriously the best transit system I have ever seen. "
Easy to navigate in English ,First time visit with minimal previous metro experience and we were able to get around. Just double check your stations and lines to make sure you get on in the right direction. Very clean.
One of the best public transportation all over the world.,Seoul's metro system is probably one of the best of its kind. There is literally no place in this metropolis that you can't reach by subway. Although sometimes you must expect to travel hours on it :)
easy to use and clean..,clean and easy to use..there's a person who will assist behind you if you don't know how will you get the ticket going to an specific place...from airport going to the nearest underground mall shopping will take more than an hour...but it's really nice choice to travel..its really convinient..if you're just in korea for a couple of hours layover...u better stay at the airport only or take the bus tour that will take you nearby the airport..because it takes more than an hour to go to the city ..but all is so beautiful..specially shopping in korea ..and the food is so great...
Easy to use,Used it whilst in Seoul just like metro in Shanghai and Hong Kong. In English and easy to navigate. If you're used to any metro this one should be no problem. If you buy single ticket you have to pay a small deposit which you get back a the end of the journey by returning the ticket to one of the designated machines
So easy to navigate!,"We tried to learn the alphabet in order to read signs and make travel easy, but all of the signs were translated, as were the maps. Grateful for the extra efforts they put in to make everything easily navigable."
Easy to Use,"For all of us non-Korean speakers, you can find metro maps in English at tourist centers and not in the metro stations. "
Not easy access,"I was surprised, everything in Korea seems so advance except the metro. Long walk in between stations and not easy access with a stroller."
Efficient & Reliable,"The subway system is quite expansive and large - for first time visitors, it appears overwhelming as there's so many stations in the network but once you understand the colour coding of the lines, it's quite easy to navigate around.Ticket machines have an English option, so grab yourself a network map and find the station you need to access and away you go."
Very efficient,The Seoul metro is a fine example of modern transport English is available at the ticket machines and the colour coding for lines and exits works wellPlenty of in station maps to guide you
Convenient AF,"One of the most convenient and useful transportation systems of the world. Even if the main lines are a bit old, the government keeps making a huge effort to provide the best quality system and to supply the needs of the locals and expats~ "
Very Expansive Subway System,"The subway system is very large, with fairly close metro stations. It has a sliding glass-like partition separating the public from the moving train, which opens when the train stops, making it safer. The metro is very clean, due to a well-run metro operation and a very conscientious Korean people. As a tourist, I was challenged with the complexity of the exits; as some metro stations had up to 12 to 14 different exits. When visiting, know what station you want to go through, but also what exit is best for where you are going. Most attractions will state the best station and exit on their website. Wherever we went, the metro (and streets in Seoul) were well maintained and exceptionally clean. It is true that everyone on the Metro was completely focused on their cell phone; hardly anyone spoke to each other."
A very good metro,"A combination of comport and frequency, Seoul's metro is a great means of transportation. Even though, when you pay single tickets, you always have to redeem the price of the actual ticket (the card itself) - which is an annoying action. Other than that, its a great way to explore the city."
Very good & efficient train system,The train system is easy to figure out and there are information booths everywhere. If you don’t see one just press the red button on the machine and an English speaking employee will go to you. All the stops are close to major destinations no need to walk so far. 
Slightly confusing,"Connecting trains are somewhat far for some stations. Quick and there's announcements for every stop in various language (Korean, Japanese,Chinese and English) but it's not loud so you'll have to strain your ears... "
Great,"Best way to explore Seoul, the metro is connected in all major destination around Seoul. You can download the app Seoul Metro (yellow in Playstore) Blue in Apps store.. Enjoy traveling.. "
Very efficient ,It's really good way to go around in Seoul. The best way is to buy money card from any convenience store and just fill it up. Is around $4. The best and cheapest way to go in Seoul.
Easy acces,"Easy to use and easy to navigate, just download the app of the Korean subway to even make it more easier to use."
Complicated lines,"There are many lines in Korea subway, where you may need a few transfer from one line to another. Do remember to download the app (korea subway) , this app very useful which provide very clear instructions on the line and station to take to your destination. "
Efficient and can get around EVERYWHERE easily,The Seoul Metro subway is one of the best and cleanest I have ever been on. It can take you all over Seoul and beyond. It is not the cheapest but not terribly expensive either. Riders line up accordingly and have seats for elderly as well.You can buy a TMoney card and load it up with funds at any subway or metro station. The announcements are generally in Korean and English unless out of the metro area. The TMoney card also works on buses. 
A complicated but yet timely rail network,"Used this rail network for a week to get around the city and attractions within Seoul. Don’t be surprised that it is normal see young and old literally running or dashing for the trains. Most stations have escalators and some even have travellators. The lifts are strictly for old folks and handicapped. It is difficult to spot a person on wheelchair, understandably that it is hard for them to move around the stations and commuters won’t care for their disadvantage. Local commuters have had the same habit of standing abreast the train’s doorway just like that i observed in Beijing rail network. Other than that, the metro rail is efficient and clean"
The best metro system in the world!,"Clean, modern, friendly subway system I've ever encountered! We are from England and London underground can be dangerous and dirty. My wife said if London underground is this clean and safe, she would use it more often."
nice transportation,"Ticket price reasonable, easier to read routes compared to Tokyo. The fares are cheap like $1.25. There were 5 of us so nearby destinations, we like to use the taxi versus paying 1.25 each for train. If you don’t have the T money card, it’s okay. You can pay per destination, don’t forget to return your ticket for a deposit redund of 500won which is 50cents."
"Efficient, cheap and easy to use!","All ticket machines are also in English and those are intuitive to use - you just need cash. Tickets are really cheap, especially for such huge city and its distances. The information system in the stations is pretty good and easy to understand, on signs and on screens. The same you can see inside the trains. Of course, stations, trains, etc. are very clean. I enjoyed all rides there."
Best metro I have used,"Being a regular user of the London Underground when visiting UK as well as experiencing the N.Y. subway and several in European cities I can honestly say the Seoul Metro tops them all. Lines from both airports and to all corners of the city. Modern, clean, fast and safe with platform safety doors at every station I went to. Easy to use system with clear signage and on board announcements in English as well as Korean. Make sure you get a T Money card either at the ticket booth or convenience store for 2500 Won and then load it at the machine by the turnstiles. Instructions on the machine are available in several languages including English. Basic ride costs 1250 Won with the card and after the first 10km there is a small additional charge per km based on distance. No charge for transfer between lines or to/from buses. From Gangnam to Incheon Airport was about 4500 Won. A bargain! The trains are frequent and often very busy but everyone is polite. Stations all have maps of the immediate area to help you find the right exit. I highly recommend using the Metro to get around Seoul."
Super duper ,"Although it doesn’t operate as fast and as efficient as Shanghai metro, Seoul metro is a life saver. Easy to use and has facilities underground from cake shops to money changer. No one needs taxi in Seoul "
Cheap and simple,"If you need to get somewhere at a specific time, it isn't the best, however if you need to get somewhere, the Metro will do just fine. Might be a little tough if you don't speak Korean but it is manageable."
Very good!,"Very good subway system, one of the best I experienced in the whole world. The stations are very clean and the trains are always on time."
Convenient and cheap if you're travelling alone,"I prefer taking the cab in Seoul as cabs are cheap, and my friends and i usually split every ride. But the Seoul metro is good if you're travelling alone. I wish they had more things such as station name written and/or announced in English too. You can also do a lot of super affordable shopping around the metro area."
"Efficient, cheap and easy to use","A great way to get around Seoul. The ticket machines in the stations have an English option, and are easy and intuitive to use. We bought T money cards (like a London Underground Oyster card) and this made our travels around Seoul even easier (and allowed us to use the bus and the AREX to the airport). Signposting is clear, with everything in English as well as Korean, and the stations and trains are spotless. I’ve used subway systems all over the world, and this is one of the easiest to use and navigate your way around."
Brilliant!,"It’s cheap, eliable, frequent and it covers the whole of Seoul. What’s not to like. Brilliant metro service."
"Convenient, Fast, on time, reliable, goes everywhere and cheap","the MEtro is amazing. It's Convenient, Fast, on time, reliable, goes everywhere and cheap. All stations are marked in English and within the trains each station is announced in English so its truly easy to find your way. WIthin the stations you can find small shops for food and other small items."
"Gotta walk a lot, though","the Seoul metro is organized and great, but many parts will demand you walk a LOT. Some exits don't have escalators so you'll have to walk up 4 flights of stairs to get to ground exit."
Seoul metro is good ,"At least I need to said for my five days in Seoul,Metro is a good friend for me. Only ₩1250 can take my to any where.  if can let English bigger in map and let me quick understand which station should we transfer is more wonderful. "
Efficient comfortable complicated,You need a subway map. I got confused a lot . There are so many lines and a lot of stations have similar names. At least there are names in English letters.
Seoul Metro,"Once you get a T card from a convenience store, it is easy to navigate and cheap. The trains are frequent and clean. "
Great,Excellent easy transportation. The only complaint I would have are the hours. My flight landed early morning and the metro was closed. 
Very reliable service!,"Easy, reliable and many stops that make it very convenient for us to move around in Seoul. Although the trains are packed during their peak hours but don't need to wait long for the next one to come. Since this is our fourth time in Seoul, very pleased to mention that their good service level maintained the same.The only drawback is that some of the stations do not provide escalator/elevator which makes it a bit difficult for us to carry our big luggage upon arrival and departure especially when we have to take few levels up/down."
Tips for Traveler friendly metro exp,"The metro was moving fast, people were organized nicely, there was even English guidelines to help you with travelOn top of all every time you were lost you can ask someone and get help. Third best metro system I have been after Shanghai and London. "
Very Convenient,The subway will get you to anywhere that you need. Very easy to navigate. The best way to get around the city.
Ease of moving around Seoul,Moving one area to another will be conducive to take subway for efficiency of mobility.. No rush for parking lot.. No worries on petrol run in the tank.. And efficiency of meeting guess or clients around metropolitan Seoul. Top up your T Money for uninterrupted mobility at the station. 
Happy ,"Great place to vacation with . Exciting people ., clean . Very helpful throughout the directions . Must come back next time "
Great way to get around Seoul!,Super easy way to get anywhere in Seoul. Just avoid rush-hour (0800-0930) and (1630-1900) if you can - or you will be crammed in like a sardine. Most subway map signs in Korean and English.
Ms ,Very close and easy to get around and we asked a lot of questions.. the walk to the main road was easy 
Very Efficient Metro,Very detailed layout to every place in Seoul. well connected and efficient network. gets crowded during peak times but well managed. Should be the primary source of travel for within Seoul - Buy the travel pass to avoid buying tickets everytime.
Easy access ,The metro have easy Access the metro have tooo many shops to buy stuff and it can reach you any where u like the ticket start from 2000 to 6000 
So easy - even in English!,The metro is so easy and cheap. It can see overwhelming at first but I highly recommend taking a second to figure it out. I was travelling solo and don't speak a lick of Korean and am glad I took advantage of this. About 1.50 Canadian each use. 
Clean and on time,"Best way to get around Seoul. The trains run every two to three minutes, rides are inexpensive and the metro will get you just about anywhere in Seoul you'd want to go."
Excelent,"I was in Soul for a couple of days, and I only used public transport; it is very user-friendly (i do not speak Korean)."
Best transportation option in the city,"Very like the Metro in Tokyo, London, New York, etc. Efficient, crowded at rush hour, but people stopped to help us find our way if we looked lost. "
efficient and crowded,"I took the nine line to Gimpo from Gangham area and then transferred to the sky line to ICN. It was inexpensive - about 5 USD. The cars were really crowded on the nine line for a while, so it was a bit of a haul but still worth saving so much compared to a taxi that be in traffic. I think it took 1:20 end to end to get to ICN."
Very clean!,"Very clean subway system that is easy to navigate once you get used to it. The trains are incredibly prompt and you'll hear a lovely jingle before your train arrives. The map lights up on board so its really clear which stop is coming up next. The stations are very clean and you'll actively see cleaners wiping down the subways on a daily basis (London could learn a thing or two from this). We're not sure if its permitted or not but we never saw anyone eating or drinking on the subway and we used it a lot, so its something to be way of. The underground stations are HUGE and take 5-10 minutes walking when you're swapping lines, something to think about if you're in a hurry.You have to use the T Money card to use the subway, topping up at stations or convenience stores with cash. Also - absolutely do not sit in the seats designated for the elderly/pregnant (even if they are empty during your trip). This is frowned upon."
Cheap clean and convenient,"You can get to pretty much anywhere in Seoul via their metro and some of the lines even go as far as the next town. All announcements are in Korean, English, and Chinese. The TVs in the carriages also show the upcoming stations.Be aware that some of the transfer between lines can be very long and not all exits have lifts if you don't want to be climbing the stairs. Highly recommend purchasing a T-money card for easy travel especially if you're in Seoul for many days. It's easy to top up at any of the machines and easy to use as well. A nice keepsake item to take home with you afterwards. I also recommend downloading the free app called Kakao Metro. It will show you how to get from station a to station b. Much easier than trying to work it all out from their enormous map. "
Great service,"Incredibly good experience for a Westerner! For example, heated seats in the morning. Yes, you read that correctly."
Fantasic !!,"What a way to travel and see all of Seoul. Extremely cheap, super simple and beyond clean! Make sure to but a T-money card and fill it with cash so that you never have to dig in your wallets. Just pop the T-money card on the top of the entry path and that is it. Quick and good to go. I used the app Subway Korea for a map and timetable of all trains.Being the respect level in Korea is set to a high standard, I find that there is proper edict on the subways as well. People are very quite, mind their own business and also give their seats to any disabled or elder people that comes on....which is wonderful ! Make sure that you do your research as to exactly where you need to go before getting on. What I mean by that is there are subway train exits that you get off train but then there is at least another 10 street exits listed by numbers and you will need to know which one to take to get you back up onto the street level. That part was a bit tricky so spend the extra time to research first.There are NO trash cans anywhere in the subway. So if you bring down water bottles or any other trash, you will have to hold on to it until you are completely out of subway.Also remember that the subway closes at midnight. Take that into consideration if you are out for a night of partying. Then you will either need a cab or bus to get back to hotel."
clean and organized,"One of the more easily navigable metro systems in Asia. It's efficient and clean with announcements in Korean, English and Chinese. "
best thing about seoul,"I love the metro! I have been in South Korea for 6months for work and I took the metro on my first day in the country with no clue of where/how I was going anywhere. The app is amazing! Kakao metro is one of the most useful apps ever. You plug in your starting point and desitnation. It gives you so much information, even down to the best train to ride in for an easy exit/transfer. The subway is insanely clean and always on time. There are special seats for the elderly, disabled, pregnant, etc. There are bathrooms in each station and they are also clean. I am super impressed with the metro system in Seoul!"
Korea vacation,Am amazed with the cleanliness of the train and the train station. There are also shops around the place and we did some shopping there before we boarded the train. The Seoul metro is the fastest way to go around Seoul. Am so envious with their very efficient transportation system. 
"Clean and good, but abit confusing at the first time","It is clean everywhere, but the signage is not that clear if you go there for the first time. Recommend you to install kakao metro app where you will get a very clear direction. I attach the kakao metro screenshot."
Great way to get around Seoul,"Used the metro to go from the main downtown area of seoul(city hall) to Gangnam and found the train efficient, clean and easy to use. Heating was good during the cold days and the announcements in both English and Korean were appreciated. This metro is also a inexpensive way to move around Seoul."
卍 A Convenient Way to Traverse Korea 卍,"Seoul is the Capital City of South Korea, and it's where my fiancé and I went for our honeymoon.Seoul Metro is convenient and clean, and unlike the Taipei MRT, they actually sell food inside the Subway System.I loved it, and even though it was complicated beyond my comprehension, I still enjoyed riding the Seoul Metro System.卍 Name Amidhaba Buddha 卍"
Seoul Metro,"I used the Metro as it is very convenient and cheap. It is working timely, I recommend to download the Seoul Metro App. Vending machines have a language option with English and please do not forget to get your 500 KRW refunded when you exist."

Best Way To Get Around The City,"The Seoul metro will amaze any Americans unfortunate enough to have to frequent the NYC subway. The Seoul metro is clean, organized, modern and efficient. All signs are in English so it is extremely easy to navigate. The people of Korea are so polite and orderly too which makes riding the metro a very enjoyable experience."
Best way to travel around ,"Timely arrival, efficient way to travel around Seoul. Clean. Nice stations, Good facilities. Interesting shops."
Info from experienced user:),"I live in Seoul for 4 years. My advice: if you want to experience Seoul subway, it is better to avoid first line:) the metro system is very hi-tech and developed absolutely well!"
My everyday transport,"I love Korean metro. Looks complicated in the beginning but after a while, I think it's the best metro I ever used. "
Crowded Yet Extremely Convenient,"The subway system is very easy, affordable, and well connected. It takes time to get used to crowds."
Easy to navigate through,Traveled in metro in many cities and I am impressed with Seoul metro. Maps and directions and signs are very clear and easy to use.
"Easy to find, friendly and pleasant ",The ride using Seoul metro or subway was pleasant experience. It’s not too overcrowded. A lot of staircase in most of the stations perhaps not advisable if ur traveling with big heavy luggages. Instagram: @bellytubby for pictures
extremely efficient....,Seoul Metro is great. The price is good. The stations are very clean. The trains are clean and usually on time. Most of the trains come very frequently. The map is easy to read and is in Korean and English. The station announcements are in Korean and English.
Excellent public transportation,"Considered one of the best in the world. Clean, friendly, easy to navigate. Consider downloading the ""Seoul Metro"" app for your trip so you can have access to all the subway lines and stops. I had no troubles using the metro to travel across all areas of the city. Plenty of shopping, food, and ATMs available as well."
Not for the faint of heart!,I didn’t go on this trip. I backed away at the last minute. It was so crowded. You have never seen so many people in a wee space. Not for the claustrophobic.
Better Than Hong Kong MTR,"Although the Seoul Metro is very similar to the HK MTR - IMHO, the Seoul Metro is by far much better. It is much more affordable, good coverage, and very easy to navigate. Most importance, the stores in each station are difference and local. Not like HK where every station has similar services (brand name stores)"
Quick & practical,"Total cleanliness, quick, accessible; plus very reasonable prices! What else should public transportation promise?!"
Fast & Simple Transport,"The subway in Seoul is really well-functioning public transport. I recommend this type of transport to all travelers in Seoul. It is simple, fast, cheap and pleasant"
"clean, efficient, easy to navigate","What more do you want from an urban subway system? Signs in Korean and English, announcements on the train in both languages, a clean environment, plenty of space. Great way to get around the city."
"Very convenient, clean, and affordable","We used the Metro everyday to get around Seoul. Really enjoyed the convenience, cleanliness, and affordability. "
Fun Safe Ride,"The best way to save money while touring around the beautiful Seoul is to ride their Seoul Metro. It is very clean, well maintained and it arrives and leaves on time. We had fun and safe rides in our stay in Seoul because Seoul Metro. The sub way are very clean, well lighted and safe. Our DIY Tour was a success because of Seoul Metro."
Perfect way to move yourself all around the city,The subway is the cheapest and fastest way to get to everywhere in Seoul. Available a rechargeable card called Tmoney.
Very Convenient,Easy access to all kinds of attractions in Korea. Cheap and affordable mode of transportation. Just be mindful of the seats for elderly and pregnant women must not be used by young visitors
"Easy, clean, well-connected and cheap","I am a foreigner who speaks no Korean, but getting around the subway was easy and fun. The price is really reasonable. If I was ever confused you can always ask Koreans around you, the people are helpful and kind and always ready to help. Even if they don't speak your language, they will try and help you out.When making connections between lines in a subway station you may have to walk a little bit...and up stairs and such...so it's not the easiest for people with disabilities."
Easy to navigate,"Easy to navigate but it gets very very crowded during rush hour, so you might want to plan your travelling at times other than rush hour. "
nice and frequent,reasonable fares to explore the City and nearby places with some shopping stores and food shops in almost every stations
Most interesting people,This is one of the best places to people watch. Three days ago I watched an African dude puke on a lady. It turned my ok day into the best day. 
Best in the world!,"This is such a well put together system, it makes it so that you never have to take a taxi or bus anywhere. "
Clean and simple to use,just grab a t money card and you are good to go. didn't experience the peak hour rush but apparently it is cozy
Good transportation ,"I downloaded the Korean subway app & Naver map app , its very useful to direct you which transit ,how many stop and save time . 1st I buy the T money card , its saves you 100 won each trip from the usual price for adults , teenagers each trip 750 won from the usual 1350 won. Need comfortable walking shoes as some underground station is quite far away and lots of stairs for transit to another line . I even use this metro for airport transfer to gimpo airport which was cheap and on time . "
"easy, cheap and fast",one of the best transportation options to get around seoul city. cheap and fast kaerna not hit by traffic jams. on certain routes and hours is very crowded
Good means of travelling around Seoul,"I had the T-money card, it can be topped up at convenience stores like 7-11. I always travel by Seoul Metro."
Excellent way to get around Seoul,"The Seoul Metro is brilliantly designed to offer easy access to almost anywhere in the city. We were in Seoul for 8 days and travelled almost exclusively by subway. We got around quickly and easily. The trains run on time, are fast and efficient, and the fare is very reasonable. The stations, the trains and the busses are all very clean. They are not crowded either because there are trains running every 2-3 minutes. I recommend purchasing a T-Money card (available to buy at kiosks in any station) which you load with money and use for subway trains, city busses and even some taxis. The subway stations are easy to navigate with English sub-titles on all of the signage. The train stops are all announced in English as well as Korean and there's plenty of signage and way-finding available in the stations to help you find your way. I 100% recommend taking the Seoul Metro!"
A confusing maze but fine once you get used to it,"The seoul metro is the most confusing in the country but once you get the hang of it, it is no problem. All stations and trains are clean and very efficient. A necessity for travelling around the city."
too many lines but very well connected,first there are total of 19 lines connecting to different parts of seoul.2nd is the efficiency..but there are too many exits and one must be very clear which to go..main concern is the numerous stairs of steps.hard to find lift in every subway.the govt should spare a thought for the elderly and foreigners who come from countries which have very good transport system.do not force them to walk and climb so much.at my age of 50 i have problem climbing and for my hubby who has asthma too.
Easy and convenient-even for English speaking visitors,The Seoul Metro is laid out just like the subway systems in many other large metropolitan areas. Multiple lines run in various directions across the city making it easy to get just about anywhere. Trains are frequent and fast and transfer is easy between lines. There are maps at each stop of the neighborhood and of the metro system making it easy to find the next stop or destination. A map of the exits directs passengers to the appropriate street up above. It's best to buy a multi-day Korail pass if you plan on using it more than once. You can reload the pass using the machines adjacent to the entrance to the lines. Just scan the card on entry and exit and you're good to go. Passengers on the train are overall quiet and courteous. In our experience it was faster to ride the subway than to sit in the traffic up above in an overheated taxi.
Clean and impressive,I rode on the weekend so was not really busy. A little shocking for a North American to see gas masks in the subway but many lines that get you anywhere. A lot of stairs and walking so might be difficult for the elderly. Seoul seems like a city made for the young
Very spacious,"The train carriages were very spacious we were so impressed and even joked about being able to dance ""in like a dancefloor"" inside. Service was efficient and stations are ""user friendly"". It gets easier going from place to place with time and practice. It's cheaper too. Not all stations have lifts though, so if you're carrying luggages, you'll have to have a bit of a workout."
Very useful!,Goes to many places and is open late. i used it to get everywhere in Seoul and even outside of Seoul. 
Easy to use,You can go anywhere is seoul with the subway. Just take an good english app that will help you. There is one that id called suvway seoul with a yellow background with a subway on it as picture. Very easy app ! If you use kakaomaps you can get around easily too. And kakaomaps is so easy to find buses too ^^
Rferreras,"Great train system. Aside from the bus, the train is the best way to go and fro the city because it brings you near the best sites in Seoul."
Efficient and Affordable,"Ok, this clearly isn't an attraction, but here's some tips for using this form of public transit. 1. There's a few apps for using it. ""Subway Korea"" was my favorite one for using in English. 2. The apps can even tell you which train car and door to go to for the fastest transfer. Sidenote: those transfer times are usually when someone is casually walking. You can cut a 3 minute transfer down to 1 if you're running for dear life. 3. Don't forget to tap out when you leave the subway or bus. If you forget, they can double charge your next trip when you tap in."
Best way to get around,"This was by far the best way to get around town. I bought a “t-money” card at the subway kiosk (they have them at each station) that I loaded with about $10 USD which was good for travel all day for about 3 days. I ended up needing to reload the card one more time that week for another $5. I used Kakao Metro app to tell me which subway to use and it was especially helpful to know which exit to get out of. Since some of the stations are so large, it was nice to get out as close to my destination as possible. Try to avoid rush hour as it gets very crowded, particularly on the green line. "
Excellent but very crowded at rush hours!,"Fast and very convenient, with indications in both English and Korean. Avoid rush hours if possible! Lots of info offered to help travellers, just need to take the time to check the maps and signs. Info desks at main stations with friendly staff eager to help."
Excellent metro ,"The metro system is great as long as I used KakaoMetro app. You enter the starting station and the destination station and you get times, stations on the way, car to ride in and any transfers necessary. "
"Decent and not too pricey, but confusing","It's decently priced (about $1.50 Canadian per ride) but you need to give a 500KRW deposit every time you buy a ticket then you return the ticket to get the deposit back. It's obvious this is a small but likely effective money-making scheme, and it bugs me. Trains take longer than most places, they were clean but the stations are quite confusing and don[t have the best signage (very little in English as well)."
"Seoul Metro (Subways, Buses, Taxi’s)","I’ve traveled to many cities & countries the world over.. None can compare to the .. fully modern, low cost, efficient, incredibly clean & ease of use of the Metro for all modes of transportation, to get to literally anywhere throughout Seoul and its surrounding provinces. You could never be disappointed as the Metro Authority has their services down to a Perfected Science. Wonderful !! :D 2018"
Best way to discover Seoul ,"Seoul’s subway is one of the best I have used in the world. It covers the whole city and is both very efficient and super easy to use with all signage, ticket machines and announcements in English. The maps of subway station exits is a must have to know where to go or give as a meeting point to people. Awesome experience! "
Easy to use and good value,"After downloading the “Kakao Metro” app, I found it easy to use, with announcements and indications in English and Chinese. Convenient and cheap both for business and shopping. Can be crowded at rush hour but beats being stuck in trafic in a taxi"
"Fantastic, easy to navigate transport","The Seoul Metro was easy to use and changes were no problem. Well sign posted and a fast and easy way to get around. The trains at times are very crowded, but everyone is respectful and you always seem to get on. It is incredibly clean and always felt safe."
easy to use,"Marked in english, on time, gets you everywhere super fast, sales staff kind of speaks english, clean and safe"
Easy travel,"No need for taxi if you're only traveling around city as Seoul metro is very easy to use, fast & cheap! Each ride cost only around 1,000won+Make sure you Kakao Metro app for easier station navigating!"
"User friendly, accurate information ","We really love to use public transport in Seoul, including this one. Seoul metro is very user friendly. We can use and change from one line to another line easily. The information that is given is always accurate. We usually check the routes from the website and follow the route (even the car and the door number). And to make everything easier, we use T-Money card. "
One of the best subway system in the world!,"Used Seoul and Inchon metro subway a number of times while travelling in Korea for a week. It is incredibly clean, efficient and comfortable ways to go from A to B. Understandably it does get packed during morning and afternoon rush hour but outside of these two busy times, it is super comfy!"
Pretty easy to navigate,"I took the system from the Incheon area into Seoul to The War Museum Of Korea. The system is very busy so it has trains running on multiple levels and the transfer station was huge. I was able to find my way to the proper level and track without much trouble at all. The system is very efficient, clean and fast."
Fast and easy,"Easy, quick, clean, and for me really nice. You can see all sort of faces, and all those faces are always smiling. If you make eye contact with any other passenger no matter if it is male or female, you will always get a worm smile. It has nothing to do with metro, but it is nice."
Efficient Metro,"Vibrant asian metropolis like Singapore, Bangkok and Hong Kong to name a few, have a lot in common. One of them is an efficient metro rail transportation system. In South Korea, the Seoul Metro runs the whole length and width of the city. And it runs within seconds of a pre-recorded music announcing its arrival in all its stations bringing hundreds of thousand of people during its daily operations. It is quite clean and comfortable and fast. Its amazing to note that in spite of its daily grind to alleviate the lives of the commuting public, hardly a news that trumpet issues in safety can be seen in the local news. The metro is a rapid mass transit that is efficient and contributes immensely to the economy of South Korea. The only hard part is for a foreigner to read and interpret the huge map of its destinations that looks like a maze in itself."
Convenient transportation system,On time and excellent value for the money. Clean and fast with many stops that get you to your destination.
"Easy, fast, convenient!",So easy to use to get around. Many tourist sites give information about the nearest subway station on their website. Announcements and signs are in English (sometimes Mandarin and Japanese too). Get a t-money transport card for extra easy use but the ticket machines also have English. Important to note that ticket machines and t-money card top up machines only accept cash.
Fascinating,This is ordinary transportation but I was so amused. But the map was pretty confusing tho haha but stilll!! I love it
Talk about convenient,"Very convenient, with the metro card that I got at the airport was able to get through my entire trip without having to recharge . You could use for the airport limousine, taxi , subway and so on . Comfortable seats , both in English and Korean , very warm in the winter"
 Great,"It's clean, comfortable and fast. Better then bus cuz it has no traffic. I just wish people would be a little nicer to elders."
"Fast, efficient, affordable","I only speak English, so it was a LITTLE bit difficult, but once I got the hang of it, no major issues. Key: know what the NEXT stop is in the direction you want to go, then it's easier to know which side of the track you need to be on and MAJOR stops on the way (ie Seoul Station and if you want to go towards or away from it). Definitely get a T Money card, even if you go for just a day, saves time and money and you can use it everywhere like 7-11 and GS25. Stations and trains are clean and signs to major attractions are a major help. "
easy access,It was one of the most comfortable and modern metro that I used in Asia and I hope UK/ London transport can learn from them.
Easy,"Better than Chinese metro, spacious and well staffed. Easy to find, and little security. Nice to have such a well run system"
Fantastic ,"The Seoul Metro is fantastic. It’s cheap, easy to navigate and very efficient. You can pretty much get anywhere you would like to. Don’t bother using the overpriced cabs just use the metro. "
Easiest way to travel in Seoul,"Takes a little while to get used to the ticket machines and the directions, but once you do it is the easiest and cheapest way to travel around Seoul"
Great!,"Download Naver and away you go. Cheap and efficient as well as easy to navigate, the quickest and best way to get around Seoul.The absence of many escalators/lifts did make travelling with luggage a bit tricky at times though as there are a lot of stairs."
Easy to navigate,"Seoul metro is IMO one of the better. Easy to navigate, quite cheap. A lot faster than TAXI especially in rush hours. But can be also very crowded."
Excellent Subway System,"Easy to navigate and very cheap. Trips cost 1,450 Won, you can get a T-Pass which works out cheaper as you just top up the card and also M-Pass is available which gives unlimited journeys for specific number of days. If getting a single journey when you leave your destination station find a deposit return machine and you will get 500 Won back for your card. Ticket machines have an English option and stations are marked in English on the maps and signs and also announcements on trains are given in English.Stations are quite large and if changing lines you may find you need to do a lot of walking. If you are going somewhere specific try to find out the exit number as most of the stations are vast so you need to make sure you have the right exit. Toilets in the stations are spotless and you feel extremely safe travelling."
Easy subway,"One of the best subway, easy to find his directionMany apps well detailled for Seoul subway and in english as well."
One of the great extensive systems,"We lived in Seoul for a decade and a half over three different periods, and have witnessed the growth of this system. The T-money system is wonderful, and one can even use the card in taxis and convenience stores.Plus, this system connects to Incheon airport, and unless one has a crying need to get to Seoul station, using the other express and regular lines can get one to lots of different places. And the system, in conjunction with the Korail system can get one pretty far south in Gyeonggi province."
Get your cameras ready!,"I never thought I can visit so many places in a metropolitan city like Seoul in such a short time. Mind blown! I‘ve been to the North, I‘ve been the South - I‘ve literally been to every place in Seoul! And it‘s only 1.450 Won, which is about 1,08€ - I‘m absolutely speechless. Forget about the Seoul Tower - who cares about a good view if you can do it all.If only I could get food and use the toilet without having to exit that would be ace but at least I don‘t have to buy an extra ticket each time I get on a different train. It’s a solid 5/7. Will definitely do it again."
An excellent subway system.,"In a country with excellent public transportation all around, the Seoul Metro is second only to the KTX (Korean bullet train). It's a little over one dollar per one-way ride anywhere in the city, goes pretty much everywhere, and relatively clean. You can find some older, shabbier trains at times, but for the most part is quick and efficient, with English-language ticket machines if you need them."
Seoul metro is great,The Seoul Metro seems complicated but once you study it a bit the apprehension calms. It is easy to get to any destination
"So comfortable, so easy, so cheap.","Unlike other countries such as Europe where the public transportation fee is CRAZY, in Korea it is insanely cheap. Not only that, the seats are clean, the infrastructure is top-notch, and most of all - it is safe. For some places, public transportations are a bit shady - but here, it is absolutely safe and clean."
Impressively efficient!,"Korea has by far the best public transit system of all the countries I've visited. Seoul Station happened to be right next to our place and we took the metro there daily. The infrastructure is very impressive, the underground developpement is very advanced and amazingly well maintained. By far the best way to travel throughout the city."
Very clean,Seoul Metro is very clean and very busy. One might find a little complicated which entrance to exit. Before travelling do some homework first so as not to waste time.
Ride these Rails!!!,"Our group used the metro system every possible chance. Acquiring the tickets at the kiosks was challenging at times due to not having exact change or bills too large. Not all machines were credit card friendly. The maps on the trains and the signage was easy to navigate-OH and the shopping is wonderful as you are walking through to tunnels to the trains! Very clean, please remember to give your seat to an older person, this is customary. Enjoy your travels!"
A great station,"Easy to navigate and work through, the Seoul metro is a hubbub of activities.Some of the main/interchange stations have little shops you could have a little pit stop at.Would certainly recommend you to stay away from the subway at peak times such as 5.30 to 6.30pm. My sister and I had to truly push our way through to get in the trains and when inside, we truly had perspective on what ""no space"" means. If you want a challenge, certainly try going on the trains during these times and see if you could Korean style you way out of these trains at your station."
This is a thing to rate? Hell yes,"One of my favourite metro systems on the planet. Efficient, generally clean, affordable, always evolving, multi language, amazing. It’s the circulatory system of one of the most dense cities on the planet. Hell yes 5 star. I’d give it 6 if I could. "
Convenient but also easy to get lost in ,"The metro system in Seoul is quite extensive, but there are so many exits and different ways to get on to the platforms that it is easy to take a wrong turn if you’re not a local."
makes life easier when u are travelling in s korea,"trains stations makes life easier when u are roaming around s korea. toilets are clean, elevator and escalator are available but not all transfers and station have it. "
Map was to bus for me..,"After travelling in subways in China, Taiwan & Hongkong this year I didnt bother downloading the subway map on my phone of bother to study before arriving. Maybe I should of.. because if I didnt have google on my phone maybe I would of struggled! I seen quite alot of foreigners looking puzzled here lol I have got lost but have had to use my brain cells more this week "
Easy to use & efficient,"Fast, clean and easy to use. One of the best public transport systems in the world. Beat the traffic and use the trains when visiting Seoul."
Amazing progess,"I used to live in Korea in the 1980s and returning in 2018 is a shock (in a good way). The new system rivals Tokyo's or Berlin's in terms of convenience and punctuality. Well done, Seoul!"
Best metro and easier ever!,"Organized, fast, clean, cheap and easy access to the main area!I enjoyed taking the metro in Seoul is easier than taxi!"
Wonderfully Efficient,"My son showed me how to load up a subway pass and it seemed to last for more than a week on 30$ US (30,000 Won) "
Cheap and Great Way To Get Around,"The Seoul Metro is a great way to get around Seoul and surrounding area. They have plenty of routes/stops. However, be careful to which routes you need to take as one of the lines (I think it was line 1) has more than one route. They have signs in english for ease of understanding. "
Very reliable service. ,Was a pleasure to ride the metro in Seoul. Everything was on time. Clean and tidy stations and trains and well behaved passengers. 
Easy as...,This is a great way to zip around Seoul. Ticket machines have an English button if needed. I brought the pass from the Airport topped it up and away I went. Don't worry about putting to much coin on the card as you can get a refund back at the airport.
A maze but it works. ,"Takes a bit to get your bearings but once you figure the lines and symbols, you can get anywhere in one or two transfers. Be careful with the station names (some are very similar) and there are no unlimited day passes. But one of the world’s best systems and the way to travel in Seoul. "
Best services ,I like the seoul metro service. The time it took and expected time checking in the metro app is exact. I was so impressed. 
Always on time,"Good transportation, fast, always on time and it connect the city very well...sometimes it is super crowded "
Facilities,Lack of information counter at the station and the staff cant really understand English. A bit confusing when need to top up the T money and refund. There is no information when is the next train coming. Perhaps the train line legend should be visible on the wall and not at certain pillars which need to hunt down which pillar has the train line. No heater in the station. it was very cold waiting for the train during winter. No lift avalable and a challenge when carry big luggage down the endless steps. Overall station is clean
Very recommended transportation!,"It was really recommended to take metro. The information is detail. Near to everywhere. Cheap, but it takes more walk to move to other lines."
well-organized subway line system,"i'm amazed by their subway line system, it's very nice and well-run.. it has 9 line, airport line, etc.. and all of it are very friendly and comfortable"
Seoul Metro,Seoul Metro was very fast and good serving metro comparing to other cities. People usually go to the work by metro
Clean and convenient ,Easy to use and the maps are clear. Easy to move around the city using the metro. Like metros in other countries but much cleaner in the stations and on the trains. 
Go ahead and use it!,"The metro system is clean and nice and wonderfully easy to use. The ticket machines all have an English option and you can just touch the screen to select your destination, no need to worry about spelling or if you spent the right amount. Signs are in English and verbal notices are done in both Korean and English. The Metro is so clean you can even use the bathroom there!! "
So convenient and not that complicate. ,"The metro system here is not that complex. Easily to transport. The stations, mostly, are clean and have a lot of space."
High speed train,"Great train ride, smooth, quiet and of course new. We travelled to Pyenchong 2 hours was wonderful. Was hoping to see something of the Olympics but there was nothing done?? sure hope they finish in time."
Efficient transport,The train frequency were very fast and announcements were made in english for tourists' benefit. Do not rush in at the last minute as we had an incident where the door closed on one of the passenger. Luckily he managed to pull away from the door.
Transportation ,"Very reliable and efficient service. No need to have a car to get anywhere in Seoul. In fact, a car may be more trouble than it's worth "
Gets around more than my mate's mum,"If you need to get somewhere then metro it is. This lovely system will connect you to even the darkest reaches of Seoul, sometimes inadvertently . Hard to tell which station you're at sometimes but what's more immersive than having to ask a Korean person who speaks no English what the next stop is? Step out of that comfort zone and get your annyeong haseyo on."
Regular visitor - Metro is great but....,"Overall clean, efficient and modelled on the Tokyo subway system. Please don’t forget to retrieve your deposit on the plastic tickets - simple enough to do. My only issue is that it can take a long time to get to some places (45 minutes for a 12Km journey) as the river splits the network. Enjoy the sleeping locals..."
Best Way to get around Seoul,"Although it takes a bit of getting used to, after one or two times you can use it without much problems, the standard ticket for 1 person 1 way is about USD$1.90 with a USD$.50 refund, so its very cheap."
Seoul Subway,"It is very good amd it gets you everywhere you need to go. As a foreigner it can be dounting. Many if not all is in Korean or English but if you are not familiar with the language many names seem to sound the same. Take care of noting the difference between ""K"" and ""G"". People who take the subway have always been very helpful to me. Many commuters speak some level of English and want to help you. Some will even go as far as to accompany you to your destination."
"Fast, clean and cheap","Seoul metro is very fast and most lines have clean trains. Just avoid commuting hours, especially in the evening between 6-8, when it is often jam-packed. Line 6 and 7 are relatively less crowed, probably they run east-west and not stop at the most popular places."
Confusing subway,"Many interchange & different col line.. Very scary for 1 timer & although they have English announcements, u have to listen very carefully. Express service train are also difficult to understand. "
Good way to get around Seoul,"Seoul metro is not as complicated as some other countries. The metro has many exit or entrances which would lead to difference places. These are the exits you want to look out for to ensure you don't have to walk a long distance to your destination. In most websites of shopping malls or attractions and some eatries, they will indicate which is the nearest exit.The metro can be crowded at times and those travellers with back pack may find it difficult to find a comfortable spot to stand without getting into everyone's way. One thing I notice is that the space for elderly seats or space for wheelchair users often allow you some standing space. If you do not see any wheel chair users in sight during boarding, you might want to chose that cabin. You will find that you have some space to stand. But do not sit on the seats for elderly as it is reserved for them. One of the best website I found is known as Subway Korea, it indicates real time travel and is easy to use. The map is in English. The metro trains have english announcement as well as an electrical board that flashes the stop the train is arriving at. Travelling by metro is convenient and efficient."
Public Transportation,Inexpensive and easy to use even if you don't read and write Korean. Don't even need cabs. We visited amusement parks and other attractions without any problems.
Easiest to manoeuvre!,"Probably the most efficient and easiest way to roam the big city (and nearby sights).The Seoul subway system is constantly extended and quite easy to find your way. Announcements and signs are usually done in 3 languages ( Korean, English and Chinese) at least whilst you sometimes find even signs in Japanese. Connections are well sign posted and easy to find. A lot of stations are underground shopping malls and it's interesting to spend done underground, especially during the rainy summer days. In comparison to many other major cities, the Seoul subway is quite inexpensive. Easiest to purchase a Tmoney card or cash bee, load it with money on one of the machines at any station( manual in many languages) and then easily cheek in and out. These pre loaded cards offer an even cheaper rate compared to single fare tickets. In addition when you transfer to busses the fare is smaller with the Tmoney card, rather than buying a new ticket for the bus. During rush hours some lines(actually most) are very packed. maybe not like the famous pics you know from Tokyo, but similar. It's an advantage to be tall and not too be claustrophobic! All other times it's ok. You beat the traffic and arrive on time. The entire system offers LTE network and mostly even free WLAN.enjoy your ride!"
Best mean of transportation in Seoul!,"The Seoul Metro is excellent! Clean, wide, punctual, good air conditioner and so safe. I lived 5 months in Seoul and could visit many places around the city thanks to the subway!!!"
Very clean very efficient,"And I say this having been around to many cities and ridden many subways. This subway is impeccably clean and remarkably efficient.Despite 60 million people, it’s not crowded. And it’s light on the pockets compared to a taxi.Big thumbs up!"
"Fast, clean convenient.","Always efficient, very clean and it is so cheap to use. Many stations which makes crossing Seoul and Neighbouring areas a breeze."
Efficient....just not easy to buy fares!!,"Great subway system. Unfortunately there is no staff to help you with buying your tickets. Also at the station you can only buy single ride tickets. Subway cards are not sold at stations. You have to buy them at convenient stores. There are 2 type of cards: one for a smaller price, which you probably want, and one for a higher price that includes some small discounts at retail stores."
Easy to use,"Very easy to navigate the subway of Seoul, most signs and directions are in English as well as the ticket machines."
One of the best transportation in the World ,"There are elevators or escalators at any stations, so don’t worry about your heavy luggage. Have a nice trip :) "
Easy to use,Seoul has about 310 metro stations. Metro is very comfortable and easy to use by kakao metro apps. It also works offline. price is depend on number of stations and even line changes. 
Seoul Metro - well connected network,"Seoul Metro was efficient,clean and well connected easy access to most attractions.The small setbacks was some stations doesn't have lifts and escalators. Its quite a challenge for tourists with luggages and elderly people.Then also there's no one mending the stations exits and need to press some button at exit gates to speak to someone that doesn't speak English.Those going for the first time and doesn't speak Korean should download the English version Seoul Metro map or live App."
Seoul by Public Transport,"We would take the train from Sendorim station which was not far from our hotel for our trips to downtown which was only 15 minutes travel. The trains were roomy, clean and very efficient. The digital display above seating and doors were laid out thoughtfully and gave clear information on stations en route. "
Great Public Transportation,"Trains and stations are super clean and easy to use! I use an iphone app (there are several free ones) and wifi on the trains and stations means you can update your location. Used in conjunction with busses, you can get around Seoul cheaply and easily."
never go on a cab ride again,seoul metro is extremely easy and cheap. you dont even have to read or speak korean as all the signs are in english. there are T money vending machines where you can top off your cards and that T Money can be used as well in taxis so you dont have to worry so much if you dont use up your T money at the metro. do download the subway app and make your life easier so you will know which exit to take for the nearrest tourist attraction.peak hours can be VERY crowded tho!
Excellent,"Korea has one of the best subway systems around the world. Download SUBWAY KOREA app to plan your journey. Everywhere has clear English explanations but it's difficult to remember Korean station names. Thus, you'd better keep looking at your app. I recommend you to purchase a T-money card from a subway station. If you take bus after train or otherwise within 30 min, you will get discount. Averagely, 1250-1500W per ride. "
Convenient Public Transport in Seoul,"You can go to anyway by using their subway. You basically need to walk more since most of the exits are far aparts from where you stop. Anyway, it’s a good exercise for your body! "
Easy and accessible,"Great subway system in the city. It connects nearly everywhere and far out. T Money cards are really great here, you can pay for so many types of transportation with them. And you can reload them nearly anywhere. They have everything in English too so you can understand it. Apps on your phone to be able to understand it too."
First ride on a Metro ,"Arriving in Korea Airport, the metro was our transportation to get out, going to Gyeounggong. This train was on time, and fast. It was clean and had a lady that goes around and take your tickets. She is like a stewardess on a train. You can look around while sitting there til you get to your destination. If you drive a car you will not see the view around you. "
Best way to travel,"Clean, safe and easy to find your way. Local passengers are polite. Very friendly to old people and persons who have disabilities. Metro personnel are helpful. In general, locals are every willing to help lost travelers."
Perfect,"I like this metro so much, it shows to travellers Japan culture, how it is orginised so well. how train comes in time always. perfect. good job. "
Holidays in Seoul ,"Modern metro is in Seoul now. And everything is comfortable and easy to find. When I came to airport I bought t-money card for transport(bus, subway, train, taxi and etc. This card costs 4000 krw and you should put some money on this card. "
Efficient transport system,Just get you a transportation card ( available in every convenient store) and charge it with money. Then you can explore nearly every part of the city by metro.
Subway,The subway is a great way to transport yourself around the city...very practical quick and affordable. The map is hard to get at first but once you get used to it ..it becomes easier to handle. And if you still having hard time to read it there's plenty of tourism information office to help you with that.
A place build for the ladies beauty and for men toooooo....,"If you think you look good but want to make it look better, start planning a trip to Seoul to get the genuine best cosmetic brands over there when your budget is ready. Brands which you can find here, they are best over that side. Why? Brands of cosmetic items are more there and even cheaper compare to most countries.Furthermore it has many products are not found in your country. Information shared by the retailers that most of the items available here are only for their local not for export yet till approved. What we have here are common items back in Seoul. Hence, beside spending a good holiday with family, we also can grab a basket of cosmetic and good for skin and health items for ourselves. Not forgetting they are also very generous in giving extra masks to customers for trial. You will sure can find something goods for your skin there. So kids have fun with skiing, museums, eating, we also enjoy our shopping for our health and beauty there too. What A Fruitful Trip!Finally, South Korea, Seoul shopping centers and many streets over there, about more than three quarter of the shop are selling cosmetics and skin care item. If you miss this center or street, assure you can grab it from another shopping Centre and street. However, to get the best one, try to look for more bigger and famous centers over there. See yourself to believe if you want to look good!!"
Very easy to navigate Seoul Metro,"As a military member stationed in Korea, I have utilized the Seoul Metro numerous times. I lived near Osan Air Base and could take the Metro up to Seoul in about 2 hours from Songtan Station for only 3-4,000 won each way. Best to get a rechargeable card from a local convenient store and swipe when you enter and exit the stations. Cards are also good for buses. There are handy maps available and stops are announced in Korean/Hangul and English. There is a handy app for smart phones that lets you track the trains and estimate times between stations. Great way to travel as the roads can be very congested especially in Seoul. Ride the Metro and enjoy the culture!!"
Easy to move about,"We used this alot during our trip and we had a convinient card which topped up once and lasted us a week, there is a refund and english friendly machines at all stations. regular timings and clean with enough seats most of the time. Elevators in most stations for the strollers and wheelchairs."
Clean & Efficient,"I rode Line 3 and Line 4 pretty religiously during my stay in Seoul, and most rides were excellent. Only one ride was so full that everyone was literally standing on top of each other, but is to be expected and was not too bad to deal with. All of the trains I rode on were very clean--however I will point out that some trains are much nicer to ride on than others. My personal favorite happens to be on Line 3; the Seoul Metro 3000 Series 2nd Generation (built in 2009/2010) and is probably one of the most modern and passenger friendly trains in the county. The seats are nice and clean, there are multiple TV screens that show the station names in Korean & English, and light up arrows pointing to what side the doors will be opening on to reach the platform. The Korail 3000 counterpart was a bit more rough however, not in as good of shape, and lacked lots of modern technology. On Line 4, both Seoul Metro and Korail trains were very nice to ride on and very clean. Although they were both built in the mid 1990's, they are still in pretty good shape--I just wish the Seoul Metro trains on this line had cloth or padded seating, as the hard metal seating gets a little annoying after a longer ride. As for the T-money system, it was pretty easy to use as it automatically deducts what you put on your card each time you go past the electronic gates. The machines that charge the card are a different story however, as two of them (one at Seoul Station and another at Myeongdong) broke down when I was just trying to reload my card. At least all of the subway staff I dealt with were very kind and quick to get things back up and running. All things considered I will certainly be happy to use the Seoul Metro again next time I return to South Korea."
Fast and clean,"The metros are fast, every 5 minutes there is another one coming. The stations are clean and the metros are punctual. T-money makes it convenient for you to get anywhere you want (transportation is crazy cheap!) and you can access anywhere in Seoul easily. "
Simple and easy way to get around with the tight ap,Great network and once you master the transfer between lines then a simple way to get to most key places.Tmoney cars makes it all so simple to tap on and tap off.The key was finding a great App which let me pick FROM and TO and gave all the key information about the number of stations and where to transfer as well as which side of the train to exit.Each carriage had lots of maps of the line and network to work out exactly where you are and going. Am sure many Apps will add this functionality and others so won't promote any one in particular.Also worth finding an app that lets your NFC reader check your Tmoney card balance. Announcements in multiple languages including English.
So easy to get around Seoul,"The Seoul Metro is super clean, and very efficient! The cost is similar to NYC metro, but I believe it's actually a little cheaper per ride. You can get a reloadable card in the metro. All of the stations and maps have the English/romanized translation of the Korean, so it's super easy to around! We only used the metro and walked during our time in Seoul and had no issues getting from point A to B. Most of the metro is connected by underground shopping paths, which was super nice in chilly December!"
User Friendly,"Was worried that it was hard to go around as there are so many lines in Seoul. Ended up learning that they are actually very easy to understand. Just choose the color of the line, look for the right direction and get off by listening to the announcement of each stop. There are also signs on the monitor for easy references. "
Seoul Metro,"Really efficient set up/system once you take stock of networks. All stations colour coded, numbered and named in English and Korean. Only moan is that when picking out sights to see on booking apps not enough information on public transport I.e station name nearest destination. Affordable, clean and organised."
Not stroller-friendly,"Convenient way to get around but not all stations have an elevator, making it difficult if you have a sleeping baby in the stroller"
"Yeah, it's a nice Subway","I'm not sure why this came up as an ""attraction""; but, yes it's a very nice Subway. One thing I would say anything about it is that you can get everywhere fully wheelchair / stroller accessible. We have two little kids in the big stroller and never had to deal with stairs or escalators or anything like that"
Not so friendly for elderly,Metro has too many staircases. Not so friendly for elderly. Although it has many lines it is easy to find the way around 
Silvester 2017 Seoul ,One of the best metro services I have come across. Really. Ice connection to all parts of city including airports. Do not enter with your coffee or bread in the train ... enjoy the music while riding to your destination. It is also really inexpensive 
5 days Seoul Stay,"The Seoul METRO is very easy to navigate and the ground staff is very helpful. if you can get a T money card it is very easy to add money into and you dont have to keep buying train tickets, just beep and in you go and out. "
Can be difficult to understand but quicker than taxi,The subway in Seoul is a bit more complex to understand but usually most of the hotels will give you a map with the subway lines. Best is to get this T-money card which cost 2500 yen. You just have to add money to the card and makes going in and out of the subway seamless. The subway has English and once inside the train there is instructions in English including the announcement but I got stuck once and the turnpike didn't let me out and when I press the help button the guy can't speak English. It turn out that for some reason my card didn't register that I went in and subsequently I can't get out.
Needs more escalators,"Trains run really fast and are jerky when starting or stopping. Seats during winter are warm though do not sit at priority seats for the old or pregnant as it is strictly not allowed. Best if you stand if it's crowded and there are few seats because the locals, especially the older ones, can get pretty rude when they need a seat. Transfers between stations usually involve a lot of stairs and long walks without moving walkways or escalators. Metro exits usually involve a lot of stairs climbing so be prepared for some exercise. If you're using the metro with luggage make sure it's small and light because you're going to haul it up a lot of stairs. Don't consider the lifts because they're always in use by the old folks and even when there are escalators it's either the narrow ones or they're out of operation. Out of ten exits only two will have escalators and out of four levels only two will have an escalator"
"Highly reliable, easy to navigate. ",Thoroughly impressed with Seoul’s metro. Visited the city for 9 days in Dec2017 and not once did the train breakdown. Highly reliable and efficient. The directions and signages were also clear (comprising 4 different languages) and easy to navigate. A very convenient way of getting around. 
the easiest way to travel in this city ,taking metro is the best and easiest way to travel in seoul. it may be little confusing at first but metro map or application can help. t-money card/cashbee card is a must have. you can buy it from convenience stores or at metro stations. recharging money is very easy since the machine has english language. 
The Best Metro?,"We've been to a lot of cities, but Seoul's metro is the most comprehensive, connected, clean, and safe. Unlike other cities that use different Subway systems, Seoul is all one company, and your fares work for buses as well. Our only issue with it is the colors, which are quite similar to each other. :)"
Very efficient and well-signed commute system ,"The Seoul Metro makes commuting around Seoul a breeze though there should be more lifts, ramps and escalators since many tourists tend to travel by the metro there. If you are an elderly traveller or someone with knee problems there, the Seoul metro can be a vertical challenge. Only certain train stations are retrofitted with ramps and lifts. Other than that, directional signs are clear and easy to follow. You can get subway maps from the station control cubicles. There are maps showing where each exit leads to but most of them are not updated as there are new buildings or malls added to the current amenity available in and around the stations. There are some stations that are linked to the Airex( the express and all-stop Airport Railway) ; mainly the Seoul Station and The Hongik University Station. That allows for easy access from Incheon or Gimpo Airport to the main cities in Seoul. "
Better than Japan underground,"I think the underground in Seoul, South Korea is easy to understand because it supports 3 or 4 kinds of announcements,different colors and there are unique number on its station. You don't need to pay extra money when you change lane but a little far and confusing direction mark makes you opposite direction..but it's better than the japanese underground which is like a web, I gave it up to understand...:)"
Clean and efficient ,"Easy to use, clean and efficient. Make sure you know where you are going before getting the ticket. The machine is easy to use. At the end you can return your subway card and get the deposit back."
easy to use,easy to use. traveling off hours is the best since fewer people are on the metro. the metro goes everywhere throughout Seoul
Easy to use with helpful announcements in English,"I printed the subway map on A3 paper when I was still at home and it made my life easier as I did not see the maps around the train stations neither at the airport nor in the city. But maybe I did not know where to look.Announcements of coming stations, transfer lines and on which side is the exit are in 4 languages including English (again this helps). Also there are maps of subway lines above the doors inside carriages. In some trains these maps are with lights showing how the train progresses between the stations.If you need to change lines it is better to examine the map beforehand so that you know several main stations in the direction you need to go. Sometimes it is not straightforward which platform you need to go to on the line you are changing. Majority of people do not speak English so you need to be prepared to figure things out on your own.Trains waiting time is about 5 minutes."
Good network,"Buy a T-Money card (sold at Convenience stores at airport and elsewhere @ 4000, excl TOP up. Most convenient to use on the Metro and you can TOP up at any metro or vending machine.Seoul Metro is itself must be one of the TOP 3 largest in terms of network connecting all parts of the city and suburbs on both sides of the Hangang river.We even went to Gapyeoung , where Nami Island is located 60 Km from Seoul. All stations well signposted - with many stations having at least 2 lines. Most stations inside Seoul have 6-8 exits or more, so look for the signs to make sure you take the right exit to where you want to go.Fares seems to be a standard 1250 per journey. "
So convenient. ,"Very efficient subway... Love the Seoul subway. Excellent connectivity, clear signages,swift and clean. "
Good metro system ,"It’s clean, busy & a convenient metro system. It’s very reasonably priced too. Tourists must explore this."
Cheap and efficient,"Fast, cheap, clean and efficient with english for easy navigation. Get the metro card from the vending machine located at almost every station and top up at the same place and not have to worry about finding loose change when purchasing tickets.For getting a refund when leaving, bring it in to most convenience stores to get the money back. Note there is a minimum though, just top up and get refunded back to get full amount."
Holiday ,"Excellent system, clean and safe! Great and inexpensive way to travel. If you have used s metro system anywhere - DC, NYC or London then you got this "
best way to travel around,"if you don't know korean, the subway would be the best way to travel around. there are always english on the map, and the vending machines. you can also download some mobile apps that can help you to look for the best and fast way to reach your destination!"
on time and very clean,as with everything that i have seen in Seoul the transport system is GREAT. there was an english translation at every stop so you wont get lost. Very easy to navigate around the subway. 
Best metro I've ever been on!!!,"The Seoul Metro/subway has to be the best subway system I've ever experienced. Not only is it quite cheap to get around especially with a T-Money card, but it's connected really well and doesn't take too long to get from one place to another. The stations are trains are really clean, the seats are heated in the winter, and there's both phone signal and wifi throughout the carriages. They're not too packed, and getting around is easy, especially with all the signposts and maps. The trains don't take too long to come by either and I love the vast stations with all their jazzy advertisements haha. I can't wait to visit again just to ride the subway!!"
Great!!,"Clean, reliable and efficient subway system at a fair price. Much better than the subway system we have in Singapore."
"Is safe, bit be carful with the line you are taking","This subway system is one of the biggest in the world. It is a little bit hard to read the small maps and some of them are in corean. But in general if you have the subway app and a little additional map with English subtitles you won't get lost, but be careful and always check which line do you need. "
Complicated subway system,"There were so many lines and transfers and I believe many locals also get lost. We were approached for help by locals (3 times) but we were also not able to assist due to the language barrier. Thanks to my daughters, we managed to find our way to our destination after studying the lines closely although we took some time to do it."
"On time, easy to commute to attractions in Seoul and nearby area",An ideal way to commute to attractions in Seoul. Just buy T-money and use it for all stations. Most of the attractions in Seoul is nearby one or two Metro stations 
Too complicated ,"I've traveled quite a lot and to me, Seoul subway is too complicated and tiring, especially compared to subways in large Chinese cities. I've got lost a couple of times and took the wrong way, because even Google maps can't find the fastest route from A to B. Huge crowds too, which is understandable for a city with the population of over 25 million. "
Easiest way to get around Seoul,"Very easy to follow/understand transit system, despite the very confusing station names! I regularly use the metro/subways in New York and Tokyo and this by far was the easist to use!"
Amazing Subway System!,"The cleanest subway I have ever been on. Fast, fast, fast! I was amazed at how easy the subway was for us to navigate. Excellent way to get around Seoul!"
Confusing,"Comparing the visual presentation and immediate understanding of its directions with Hong Kong MTR, Seoul Metro has too many lines and is very confusing in its representation. Transfers are also a long walk from one line to the other, not a friendly structure."
Fast and efficient system,"You will never get lost with is massive plenty of Lines in Seoul. Easy and simple to use. It connects you to most of the major attractions. That’s mean you will never get lost. The only bad thing is that, no customer service counter for tourists. Most Koreans don’t really understand English so well. So have to say slowly and steady or use goggle translation. Which is the best. "
Transit station 轉車站,"Be careful to find your way in this big transit station. There are different metro lines, airport rail and train stations. Find your way carefully, read road signs, find your direction and do not get lost. Road signs are in multi-languages. Suggest to buy a T-money card to accelerate the access. 在這個大型轉車站要小心找路，這裏有不同的地鐵線路、機場鐵路和火車站。 仔細找路，閱讀路標，找到方向，不要迷路。 道路標誌是多語言的。 建議購買T-money卡出入閘。"
Awasome,"Firstly you need to get Subway map on your phone or paper map. In seoul metro there are too many transit lines and you can go everywhere by using metro. In the subway stations you can find restrooms, coffee shops and convenience stores. Enjoy your travel!!"
Convenient ,"Used the metro frequently during our 3 days stay in Seoul. It’s very convenient. Metro comes very quickly. Metro stations & metros are clean and safe. Navigation is easy too, they have the map in English."
Fast and Efficient Metro,What can I say With multiple lines and most of the time on time service this is one of the Best metros that I been to.
Great Way To Get Around Seoul,"We bought the Discover Seoul Pass which have the T-Money Card so very easy for us to use. We just need to top up at the stations & from there onwards, travel was made easy to us. The cost of using the T-Money card was also cheaper that buying direct. The map is very clear & easy to read. Take note of the Exits when you wanted to go to the attraction places. Be extra careful on the coach since some coaches will be crowded with people during peak hours. Avoid the ones near to the exit staircase or lifts. There were seats for disable & pregnant ladies. Some of the locals may be rough so just take note of that when taking the subways."
Modern and relatively easy to navigate.,I had a bit of trouble trying to purchase a ticket when a very helpful local came to my aid. He did not speak English but he was able to assist me with the use of a written address and a bit of sign language. 
Easy to navigate around the city,"The map is very clear and easy to understand, but if you tend to carry big heavy bags then transfering between lines will be a problem since you will have to go a long way to get to another line"
Convenient ,The most convenient and inexpensive commuting options on the planet. And I have ridden on Japanese rails.
Great transportation in Seoul,"The Metro is one of the public great transportation in Seoul, many people that is local and tourist use this transportation, then bus, taxi, etc.The fare is cheapest and all areas or location can be reached by this metro."
Excellent coverage,"A great way of visiting this huge city. I didn't get lost once, despite my terrible sense of direction and my non-existent Korean language skills!Just remember the colour on the line your are travelling and (try to) remember the terminal station to go in the right direction."
The world best and clean metro,"Very clean and modern metro. convenient and most reliable transportation in the city of seoul. Metro runs every few minutes in every corner of Seoul through center, many different lines of route covers the whole city like spiderweb. Clear announcements on each and every stop. Most effective way to explore Seoul. Fair is cheap. "
Super awesome,Best system of public transport i have used. Super easy and comfortable. Takes you almost everywhere around Seoul
Use Kakao app,"The best way to get through the sybway is Kakao app. It will save lots of time and trouble. Subs are clean, on time and easy to ride. "
Easy to use,Signs are easy to follow. All the train lines are numbered and coloured coded. You can look at the monitor situated inside the top middle of the train to know which side (left or right) to get off.
Seoul train!,So convenient and easy to take and goes everywhere you likely want to visit. I don’t recommend taking from the airport though - take the shuttle bus (there’s plenty at the airport) and much much faster getting to your hotel.
Braving the cold winter days ❄️,"Looks complicated initially but when you understand the map, its so easy to go around Seoul by train ☺️☺️☺️I loved that seats were heated because its freezing cold outside! Carts are clean too! Stations were not as chaotic as new york but not as well maintained and clean as japan ☺️Oh and so many shops in the stations, and I’m not sure its a good thing because I tend to spend more time on the stations looking around "
Efficient and punctual,"The Seoul Metro is a great way to get around the big city! It could take you as far as Incheon and Suwon. It was clean and easy to access. However, if you are a PWD or elderly, you might have a little difficulty in navigating some of the stations because sometimes there are no lifts or escalators."
"Safe, clean, efficient - and huge","The metro network is the way to explore Seoul. If you stay only few days and plan less than 5-6 rides per day, buying single trip tickets is easier than buying a rechargeable card. 500 W deposit on single fare cards will be immediately returned after the ride. Caution: you need cash for the vending machines (that can be switched to English language). Single fare tickets can also be used when transferring between lines. Metro is much faster and more easy to pay&use than buses. In peak times be prepared however that the trains are really crowded."
Very efficient metro system....2 caveats...,"Seoul has an excellent metro system, the stations are clean, not too confusing as it has English names and not too many exits (as compared with say Shinjuku or Shibuya), most sights are also easily accessible by the metro. There's however something you need to take note, it is not very accessible as all stations are mainly access by Stairs, hardly any escalators and even fewer lifts. So if you have a pram or using wheelchair, i forsee a lot of problem using the metro. Another observation, the gates are fairly small.. still ok for me even if i'm quite big size but i can imagine some oversize folks having problem getting through the gates. "
Can be a little messy,"Can be a little messy if you taking it for the first time. I took an express train without realising it until I was return to the previous stop. They actually label their lines, platform & exit with numbers. Can be a little confusing sometimes..."
Good Transportation,"The metro in Korea almost cover everywhereIt's easy to find exit, transfer and entrance to many place"
Spotless and efficient,"Great subway and easily the cleanest I've seen in a long time. Respectful passengers (most on cell phones), and regular schedule so wait times were not long. Well-connected underground shopping, too. Best choice for getting to all major sites in Seoul."
"Fast, easy to use for an English-speaking foreigner","Fast, easy to use for an English-speaking foreigner after just a little research or advice. Clean and quiet. Not too crowded usually. Very extensive"
Train to Busan,Ever watched the movie Train to Busan? Traveling from Seoul Station won't be a nightmare for you. Just remember that its a big complex. Go to Information counter for reliable info and yes they speak English. Get orientated with the place and enjoy your travelling whether alone or in a group. Even if you forget to bring your ticket do not worry as the is a booth for you to access your internet email and print it out at very small fee via T-money.
Super easy to use.,"Everything is in english, and the train staff is friendly and helpful. This is probably the best way to get around Seoul when the trains are running. "
Efficient. Easy to use. Gets around most of the places.,Efficient. Easy to use with their mini map given with the T card. Took some of the rides during peak hours and it’s not a good experience as it was jam packed. Will recommend buying the T card instead of single trips as it’s slightly cheaper.
Easy to go anywhere in Seoul,Very convenient using Seoul Metro to go around. This transportation cover almost all tourism area in Seoul
Convenient,"Nice, comfy and not confusing transportation, I'm using it every day instead of the bus and it's way better. "
Metro,Dificult to find the right train and therefore transfere to another station. Your ticket is depend on your distance. Our metro card had insufficient amount and we stuck inside metro until one very kind resident helps us.
Very easy and accessible,"The metro system is so much easier to use then I expected, as you just by a t-money card and top it up as you need to. As well as the maps are in both Korean and English, as well as approaching stations on the train, it will be announced in English. The metro is also very clean "
easy enough,got to say it wasnt hard taking the subway in seoul. although the english language sign are rather small to read but if you pay enough attention you wont get lost.
One of the best subway services in the world,"The Seoul Metro is one of the best subway services I have ever used. There were plenty of directional signs in English to direct you either to transfer to another line or to your exit. The train itself is clean, and it comes with cushioned seats, unlike the hard plastic or metal seats elsewhere. There's even a overhead shelf for you to place your bag. How thoughtful indeed. However, I could only give a 4 rating because some of the stations did not have escalators installed, so climbing up the steps was a bit of a challenge when you have bags of shopping on you. Apart from that, it's a great way to travel within Seoul."
Convenient Way to Travel,"Use a mobile app (such as Subway Korea) and navigating the system would be quite easy! The app tells you the number of stops, where to transfer and even which side the train door will open.I used the metro during non-peak hours. It was crowded (no seats), but few people standing.A good experience."
Go with time,"I have been using many metros around the world and the Seul Metro was the most difficult to use. I used Google maps but they don’t have the accurate information to move around with. So, to use it, go to the station with google maps, a paper map of the Seul Metro Stations and plenty of time. Stations and trains are nice, new and clean."
Excellent,"The subway was very efficient, well connected and clean. It was a good experience taking the seoul subway trains."
WOW!!,"OK, I live in Boston, have lived in NYC, and have traveled widely in Europe and elsewhere, I have never experienced stations and trains so clean and comfortable. Good signage in the trains and stations -- Lots in English. We found it easy to get around. Better than taxis for most sites."
Long long walks,"Every time we used them they were quiet busy never ever got a seat , be aware if you have disabilities as no escalator or lifts just stairs and when there was you had to walk miles .Study what exit you need as if you take the wrong one you could end up walking miles to get we’re you wanted to go ."
Efficient train services.,"My son and I were impressed by the Seoul train lines. Numerous train lines (colour coded) and 'uncountable' stations. Yet it was quite easy to find the right train to our destination which was more than 1.5 hrs away. People were quite orderly when queuing up. On the train, we witnessed salesmen trying sell their products (but no hard sell), a blind man asking for donation and also a woman scolding 'someone' invisible to us. Despite all these, it was a pleasant experience to us."
"Extensive and the only viable travel options, mostly","This is a huge travel network, mostly easy to experience, but for a foreigner requires vigilance, as the stops are only fleetingly flashed on the screens inside the trains, and the announcements in English are usually unintelligible. Watch your progress on a map, and be careful what exit you take as they come out blocks apart....you can get lost at night. If possible avoid rush hour, and it can get really packed."
Great system ,"The frequency of services and the cleanliness of the facilities can't be faulted. Sure it's crowded during peak times, but that's how it works. "
Clean and convenient ,"The Seoul metro is incredibly easy to navigate, inexpensive, and clean. There is so much to explore in this amazing city and the metro can be part of the adventure. Dual language maps are located all over the stations and in the trains, the stops are announced and clearly displayed, and navigation through the transfer stations is well marked. The stations/stops often have interesting small shops to explore and you can even find some delicious treats! Pay close attention to the exit you choose as you can end up turned around when resurfacing. Even for novice travelers the Seoul metro is a great way to get around a large city. "
Excellent network and system,Pretty standard and straightforward metro system to use. Relatively cheap. Really liked the idea of recycling the used ticket to get the deposit refund. Definitely reduces the carbon footprint by recycling paper. 
Seoul Subway,"The Seoul subways are one of the easiest subways to use I have ever encountered.They have lots of line(not as complicated as Japan's) and virtually able to connect to everywhere in Seoul(you can transfer by bus for places not accessible by subway).Highly recommend to purchase their transport card, T-Money(other options are the Seoul Travel Pass, Rail+) for easy travel and also cheaper by 100won compared to using cash.Alot of improvement have been made to facilitate handicapped and stroller usage. Almost all subway station now has an elevator."
Do not afraid of subway in Seoul,Seoul metro is very convenient transportation in such big and vast city. After couple days you can use it easy. But first couple days are most nervous and disturbing. If you missed a direction of entrance in subway it is not easy to return. Then there is no signs in English of next stops in every car of train - you have to count stops)) But as I said next days everything become clear and simple)))
Very affordable and intuitive,Very cheap and easy to use. Everything is in English and one can easily navigate. Make sure to read instructions and use your head. 
very efficient,"very efficient railway system!!!! one of the best and comprehensively covers entire Seoul!!! the minimum fare is quite higher though if you compute it at fare per station, going to a nearby station would come out costly so better study a map and take a walk!"
Cheap and Easy,The Seoul metro is a cheap and efficient way of going around Seoul especially for a solo traveler like me. Most major tourist destinations have a metro/subway station near them so its very convenient going around from one place to another. 
The cleanest public transport I have seen!,"Inexpensive, on time, fast and very clean. Also easy to navigate.Tip: if you return your ticket/card, you get a 500 Won deposit back. "
Free exercise ,"The trains come often, but they are usually crowded and spending a day touring Seoul by subway certainly racks up the stair climbing and kilometres walked."
Huge stations,The stations are massive. It can easily take 10 minutes to just get out of them. We were amazed by this. Good service on the trains though. 
Travelling Seoul by subway,"Get a T money card it will be more convenient and you will get cheaper fares to ride the metro/subway. If you buy single trip ticket, it will cost around KRW 1450, but with subway card/T money KRW 1250 (depending on the destination) and you don’t have to buy tickets at the vending machine all the time. It will be cheaper to do this rather than taking a taxi (with all the traffic jam and bad driving of the driver). It’s quite simple to learn the Seoul subway. But notice that most station has plenty of exits, so check out which exit is the nearest to your destination. And plenty of stations don’t have escalators and only stairs and elevators (but prioritized for elderly, disabled people, pregnant women, people with baby strollers and with luggages)."
"Clean, easy to use and on time.",Staff is usually very friendly and would even walk you to your train in case you're completely lost.The ticket machines also work in English. 
Easy travelling,"The Best way to go, when in Seoul.. very Easy, even not being experienced with metro’s.. cheap and you get a refund when leaving the station.."
Excellent way of transport,"The city has a great network of subways covering everywhere. All you need is to buy a T money card available in many shops. It is a city pass and you can top it up from many outlets and at the subways. You can use the card for subways, buses and taxis. The subway stations jingles and songs are very nice and you would definatley enjoy the transfer station song when there is a change of the line. The price of the card is 3000 won and you can top it up according to your use of the network. "
Best Way to get Around the Metropolis,"The best way to get around Seoul City. The transportation is cheap, easy to access and efficient. The train is clean, the station is clean, and could be the fastest and cheapest way to get around the city since taxi fare is quite expensive and the traffic is heavy. I recommend you to buy electronic payment card that can be toped-up to make your payment easier."
This is the only way to get around in this great city,Seoul is very easy to navigate if you take the Metro. It's organized and affordable if you can handle the stairs
"Goes from A to B, but not always in a straight line","The metro works fine as long as you know your way. I find the system of single tickets quite a waste of time, would like a system like the Suica in Tokyo available for visitors.One thing is, due to the layout of the lines which is a system of winding lines it’s not always easy to find a straight route between A and B and trips can be quite long if you have a transfer or more. For instance it takes 1.5 hours from Gangnam to Anguk. And it costs 1.5 USD, which is fine.Can be crowded at peak times of course but otherwise the trips are OK in terms of comfort."
Best Way to Get Around,"Cheap, easy, and efficient. Everyone is so polite and the trains are super clean. Definitely the fastest and probably the safest way to get around the city."
Good public transportation,"For 1st timer to seoul. Download seoul subway from google play. Easy to move around. Or download seoul subway map also can. Easy to refer. You cant get subway map from station. Due to, too many lines in seoul. Definate you will confuse. "
I just love it,I went to Korea with my friend in September and to be honest we were really scared of Seoul Metro when we were planning our trip. At first we felt like Alice in Wonderland but it's not that complicated as it looks. 'Korea tour - offline maps' app was very helpful. Of cousre it was extremely crowded sometimes but we were counting with that. The underground shopping centers are awesome!!! Plus they have soo cute metro cards~~
A bit complicated,Best way to go around the city (if required only!) It is very clean but you have to listen carefully for stops as the sound system is a bit faint
Clean and easy,"Compared to the one in France, its so clean and high tech! Wifi everywhere in the metro! It's also super easy to navigate and if you don't understand, koreans will gladly help you :)"
The best metro...,"The Seoul Metro is probably the cleanest and safest metro that I’ve ever been on. Because Seoul is a very heavily populated city, the metro can get very busy. This was my preferred mode of transportation while in Seoul. "
Intimitating but manageable ,"Yes the seoul metro can be intimitating and complicated for some. All you need is to google the place you are visiting and the nearest metro station. The next tool you need is the KakaoMetro-Subway Navigation. It tells you how to get to the other subway station and also where to transfer. It also provide you with an estimate of timing. Also for transfer like an interchange station, you do not need to exit thru the gantry. There is usually a passage way or linkway for you to transfer to the next line. Lastly, ensure you remeber the exit no to exit. Else be prepare to walk in circles or walk alot of extra miles! "
Good connect,The subway trains are well connected however as it's really huge sometimes it takes 10min walking to reach exits.
"Easy To Navigate, Safe, Efficient","As you would expect, Seoul Metro is a great way to get around the city. The transit card system is easy to use and inexpensive. One tip - most destinations include an Exit number in their directions. This is very helpful as stations are large and walking out the wrong door may mean getting lost."
Easy and safe,Very clean and safe overall. Easy access point to point. Great transfet system to change to buses. 
Clean and on time,The metro system in Seoul is reliable and cheap! Great way to get around.Especially from airport.....only 5000won depending where you end up.
A peaceful ride,"For me Seoul Metro is the chepeast, most convenient and fastest ride you can get to you enjoy and travel around Seoul.The structure of this subway system inside-out is very tourist friendly that even a solo-firtst time tourist wont get lost.The Subway is equiped with easy to understand directions both inside the train or at the terminal. Inside the train, stations are announced in english, there are also navigation system at every door that will give you the information of the stations that the train will passby which include the stations with connecting lines and the door where people will get off are also shown on the screen where the station names are being flashed. While at the terminal, they have maps of the stations which are posted at the pilars supporting the terminal. There are also infoTV showing the train's current location and estimated arrival. Tourist attractions in the vicinity are shown in a map including landmarks and are also listed down and categorized per Exit# so that you would know which exit to take in case you dont know. People in Seoul follows train etiquette which really amazes me because even kids know where to seat."
Efficient and comprehensive,Giant metro system. Totally efficient. Easy to understand. Inexpensive to ride. Covers almost anyplace and connects to commuter trains out to even more tourist sites.
Convienent way to get around Seoul,The best way to get to different places around Seoul. You buy the t pass which cost about 3000 to 10000 won. Once you purchased the t pass add money to it. There ride is about 1.25 usd per ride. It is user friendly train systems. There are different color trains. Each going to different destinations. All the trains are located underground. Bring your sneakers because you will do a good amount of walking. 
Excellent,"Well organised metro network, buy a T- money card so you can travelled around Seoul for all the tourist attractions.Similar to U.K's Oyster card but a lot cheaper."
Visitor friendly,"Taking metro in Seoul is easy. Not only ticket machine can be in English, it’s user friendly. Furthermore, metro station and train tracks are organized and clean. We felt very safe taking the metro. I highly recommend as it can save time and money!"
All good.. No complaint..,"First of all, there's no undead chasing you to Busan. I've traveled using Metro and Subway almost everyday. Well, they have a peak and off-peak hours and you can just use your logic of when is the peak hours? So just sit back and relax.."
"Seoul Metro is fast, clean and efficient transport","This is a great way to reach tourist destinations, shopping and new attractions at very reasonable rates in a fast clean and efficient way. Some tourist area stations have very clean toilets, shopping kiosks and cafes and friendly guides/tourist info."
Must Try,Convenient | Easy | Fast | Covers almost all the part of the city | Easy escape from Traffic on Road | Decently Crowded | Manageable | Safe for Female/ 
Relatively easy to get around town.,We only used it once but it seemed to be relatively easy to get around town. We went from Korean Fish Market back to our Oakwood at Coex Center and it took us less than half the time as a taxi.
Great way to get around Seoul,"The Seoul Metro was clean, effective, and easy to use. I took the Metro from Gimpo Airport for approximately $2.00. Station stops are announced in Korean and English."
Easy to use,Your first use of a new subway is always a bit daunting but Seoul subway is great. Get yourself a prepaid card and hop on and off whenever you like. Can be very cramped at rush hour times. This is the easiest and best way to get around Seoul.
Great train service,"Well laid out. Instructions easy to follow, and the glass along every station for protection is first rate. Trains punctual and easy to access, Not excessively crowded, and always spotless."
"It's Quick, It's Cheap, It's a Metro","I found this easy to use but you will need to persevere until you understand it!The ticket machines do work in English and you can buy one-off tickets if you're only doing a few journeys. It is really cheap and pretty logical. As with most metros: know where you are going and the route you're taking, including the end stations on the lines you're using; buy the ticket; jump on. The stations are signed in English (or follow the line and direction - this can involve a long walk BTW). The cars also have signs showing the next stop in English.I just wouldn't try to learn this during rush hour."
"Convenient, On Time, and Value","From Inchong to Seoul Station Non-Stop. Clean, safe, easy to negotiate, reserved seating, fast, and comfortable. Advice, if you're not young and agile (we're older), choose a departure time that gives you the time you'll need to get to the track. This is NOT a negative, just common sense."
A palace where the last dynasty lived,It ‘s a palace where many last dynasty lived for 500 years. A must see place if you are looking for something traditional in very modern city.
Fastest transportation,"Easy to use, you can even download some app so you can search the subway direction easier. This is the fastest transportation, we can save our travel time so we can visit more place. It's a good way to lose some weight too, because sometimes you need to walk then take a stairs to change a line haha. But after all this is still the best and fastest transportation if you want to explore Seoul."
Good Network,Convinient but lack of foreign language available. Signboard could be confusing for foreigner at times.
Don't forget your refund,It was easy to use the ticket purchasing machine to get the correct number of transfers. The metro was easy to use. Don't forget that you pay a deposit. Get your refund on your deposit before you leave.
Best I’ve ever seen !,"The Korean metro system is extensive - with 21 lines, and is all you’ll ever need here to get around. The metro even goes quite far in the countryside.In essence - during a 2 week stay with plenty of travel, we never had to take any public transport other than the metro. "
Ease to get around,It was very convenient to take Seoul Metro to get around the city. It connects with bus lines and fees are really cheap. 
T Money Card,"After a day or two of using the metro, it's pretty easy! If it's your first time using the metro you'll want to purchase a T Money card. You can get one at pretty much any gas station or convenience store and then you'll add money to it at any metro station. A T Money card will save you lots of time and money if you're going to use the metro a lot, but you can also buy single trip tickets as well. "
Concenient,The metro is rather cheap and good to get around. Especially as there is lots of traffic in the city.
Great way to travel,"Buy a T-card, and you can use the Metro to go almost anywhere in Seoul. The Metro is clean, and the trains run often. The only downside is that there are many stairs and not many escalators, relatively speaking."
Idiot proof ,"I am a buffoon when it comes to tranaport, and rhe Seoul Metro is English Idiot proof, simple Maps simple connections and more importantly ita cheap "
Clean and efficient,"Seoul metropolitan subway in South Korea is the most widely used rapid railway transport system in the world, featuring ten subway lines. It is clean and efficient. The system serves the ten million people who live and work in Seoul as well as the provinces of Gyeonggi, Incheon and northern Chungnam. The total length of the subway line is about 180 miles. The subway lines are colour coded – and the signs are in English and Korean. The Seoul Metro underground system has 291 stations. The lines are operated by four companies – Seoul Metropolitan Subway (Seoul Metro), Seoul Metropolitan Rapid Transit (SMRT), Korail (Korea National Railroad) and Metro 9. The transfer points and stations are announced through pre-recorded messages in both Korean and English."
Best transit system in Asia,"We live in Japan and thought they're transit system was great but Seoul is by far superior and CHEAP! Buy your ""T"" card from station or any 7/11. "
Easy to use and cheap.,If you're in Seoul then I thoroughly recommend using the Metro to get around as it cheap and really easy to use and not overcrowded like other underground railways I could mention.
A little odd for a forienger,"I rode this system in 2008 and although it was not to difficult, as a white American, I often felt uneasy; a few times there were Korean males that would stare at me. Unsure why but it could have just been an unawareness of culture. Ensure that you have a Metro map and understand the layout, as well as where your travel targets are. Traveled in 2008"
Seoul Metro.,"The Metro is by far the quickest method of travelling in and around the capital, but there are several lines, and the tourist might find it a little complicated as little is written in English. It is efficient, speedy, but overground buses might be easier to find your way around."
"Great if you have a transport card, not if you need to buy tickets","The vast majority of Koreans that use the Seoul Metro use T-Money cards or similar for accessing the trains. But visitors without a T-Money card are at the mercy of the ticket machines at the stations. And it is very clear very quick that they are not frequently used. My first experience was an attempt to buy a T-Money card using the vending machine at the station. I followed the prompts (in English) and did everything I was supposed to do and it didn’t dispense a card. I tried cancelling the transaction and no luck. I tried pressing the help button, but no one answered and no one came.With no other option, I went to the single ticket vending machine. I selected the station I was going to and while I was putting money into the machine it timed out and cancelled the transaction. Fortunately it did return my money, but it took me trying multiple times at that machine and two times at a different machine before I got a ticket. I explained this to the local team I was working with and they agreed to come down and help me, obviously suspecting user error. It took us three attempts to get a ticket. The machine wouldn’t accept my bill, so my coworker got out their bills and it wouldn’t accept them either. We tried 2 more machines before it finally took the money and gave me a ticket.Over the length of my trip I used the metro 5 times and was never able to get a ticket to dispense the first or second try. What a complete mess.As for the trains themselves, they are clean and relatively modern. Realize if you hit the metro during rush hour, you will be herded into the car and squeezed in until there is no possible way to get anyone else into the car.In the end, it is a very convenient system obviously not designed for visitors. Unless you are comfortable with frustration, taxis Amy be a better alternative for the traveler. "
Great system but could have been more user friendly .......,"We have been to Seoul F&E few times & always uses the Metro & buses.Its an excellent, clean, efficient & comprehensive system that bring one to most attractions in/out of city ( incorporating buses on certain outlying attractions).For first timer, take note :1. The underground stations are very big (super huge esp in city stations). Be prepared for very long daily walks & climbing steep level of stairs at every station esp if you are doing a transfer within. 2. For most stations, you have to climb up many stairs to exit or transfer to next line. And there are alot of steps to climb. Only certain stations or sections have escalators or lifts. You will be very ""fit"" after leaving Korea. Imagine carrying your big baggage up or the steep stairs. Its common to climb many many hundreds of steps daily.3. A noticeable but essential facility for tourists is now missing. All stations now do not have information office ( empty) except for a few. In our last trip it was still available. Be prepared to ask locals for help for directions. Language is a problem as many don't speak English.4. The directional signs are confusing & with insufficient information. In the huge stations, be prepared to walk very long to try & find right exits. To make matters worse, many stations are linked as well.Eg - when we exited no 6 to our intended place, we ended up at a much farther at another station exit 6. Directional signs only show exit numbers, not the location. Only on road level, it shows the station names.Often asking locals for help is a problem due language & one could end up worse due miscommunication. But the locals are very nice- they always try to help.5. Its not easy to use the ticket machines. On top of the regular queues. Save yourself the hassles.Buy a T-money card from 7-Eleven & other convenience stores. Top up at similar shops. Just tap & go- can be used for buses as well.Although this is a great system, its not user friendly. Do not recommend to use this system comprehensively for those with young children, elderly or those with physical or health issues."
"Clean, Fast & Not Expensive",The Seoul Metro is an excellent way to get around the city and escape the horrendous Seoul traffic. It is well worth the money.
good public transportation,very extensive metro line and tourist attraction sites are reachable with the metro. however it is not that disabled-friendly. Some flights of stairs at some stations without elevators or escalators
Convenient ,Very easy to navigate and convenient to use. T money very convenient to load. You would also admire how koreans will not occupy the seats dedicated for elderly and /or would get up (and offer the seat) once an elderly enters the train. 
My favorite game in Seoul!,"I can't imagine a better transportation system in our age than Seoul metro!It's cheap and it's fun and very efficient.Cons:It is getting closed at midnight, so the only time I had to use Taxi in Seoul was when I stayed late in my friend home.Also, the T-card can be recharged only with cash, so you have to bring enough cash with you and not depend on cc."
Easy,"The Seoul metro is easy to use, read and understand. It helps to know which exit your destination is close to. The exits are well marked and directional sign posted. There is a difference in trains though. On some one can easily follow the journey with lighted indicators. The sound system that announces the stations is not easily heard. Best to have a T card for quick in and out of stations. The system is similar to many other metro systems in the world. "
"Easy, efficient, timely","As in all things Asian, Korean, the height of efficiency. Even for a tourist the system is easy, no language skills necessary.Fast, always on time, clean."
Easy to navigate,"This is a easy system that takes you anywhere you want to go. Be warned, however, there are lots of stairs and few escalators. Your legs may be sore!"
Peak hour is scary,"Beware the harmless looking little old ladies who will attempt to mow you down if you're in their path. Also, people may not allow you to exit before barging in. Get ready to fight your way out during peak hour. And also.. the central heating makes the trains extremely hot and stuffy. Try not to faint. Also some train apps integrate the AREX lines with the metro lines. Beware that although it's stations with the same name, they are not always integrated (ala in the same location). "
Easy to use,"One of the best metro systems, The announcements of the train are in both Korean and just about audible English. When we did have a problem finding a platform locals were very helpful. Fares are very reasonable."
Great ,"The best and easy to way to move in Seoul. First you should know that, any amount of money remaining in your Tmoney card it can be refunded easily anytime if that is less than 20000 KRW from GS25 “convenience stores”. Also, this card can be used in buses in Jeju island. "
"Excellent for adults. Doable with a stroller, but not recommended.","The Seoul metro is wonderful if you want to get anywhere in the city or beyond. It's very easy to use and apps will tell you arrival times to the minute and which door of which train car to exit from to get to your connection quickest. You're not supposed to take strollers on the escalators (obviously), which means you'll need to use the escalator if you're traveling with small child. In some of the larger stations, they're easy to find; in others, it can be a real hassle to find the handicap accessible route. Sometimes it's not even an elevator, and it's just a chair lift attached to the side of the staircase (I believe there are a few like this near the palaces). Just something to keep in mind if you're traveling with small kids."
"Efficient, Quick, Cost effective","Efficient, Quick, Cost effective. Do buy the T-MONEY card if you are staying for more than 2 days.....  "
Very helpful,You download the app and it’a a very convenient way of transportation when you want to go to different places. You just need to know where you’re going. 
"A little scary, a little complicated looking, but then...","Do not worry, after a while it all starts to make sense! I used an app named “city mapper” which makes traveling around Seoul much easier (on the bus too), but make sure you remember which stop to get off at incase your phone runs out etc!But a top up card from the local supermarket and your ready to go! (This also works on the busses and metros) I’ve attached a metro map for your convenience, hope this helps! "
Great connectivity,Every traveller will find this best to move around and with TMobile card valid for metro rides it makes it very convenient way to see the city .The card is available from Story Way Convenience Store locations all over the city 
Crowded,"Crowded, many people. Small chance to get a seat. Mostly standing up all the way. Quite convenient, a bit confusing with Korean alphabet and language. But manageable. Easiest transportation and organized."
Smooth and easy,"Seoul metro is very convenient. Just download the subway map from app store, it will show and teach you all the routes you need. Bravo!! "
Always on-time :),Never missed out on my appointments as the trains were absolutely running smoothly.Not as crowded compared to Tokyo.
Clean and efficient,"One thing i get jealous about always when i visit different coutries is their metro system. Oh man, Seoul's metro system is sooooooo nice. HUHU. A lot of stations have transfer stations, train intervals are fast, clean bathrooms at every station, you can change to long haul commuter train and even airports. Wow."
Know where you are going before boarding this-Can get very crowded and stuffy,"Seoul is a very crowded city of over 15 million, and getting around in this city is not easy. Using Seoul Metro saves time as it rides on its own railroad tracks, but its destinations are limited. You need to plan ahead by getting the maps of Seoul Metro map, Seould underground train map, and various bus map, and plan ahead for your travel destinations. During commute times, this Metro can get very crowded, and during summer time, it gets stuffy and hot. Nevertheless, it is a viable alternative to very busy Seoul streets in getting around. If you use taxi, count on getting into a long traffic jam especially during commute times or during week-end."
Easy Peasy,"This is the most reliable transport facilities outside Japan that is reliable, efficient and affordable. The station is user friendly, there is an underground shopping thats serves the opportunity for any last minuite shopping.They have 9 lines that connects Seoul to almost every part of the city. Not as busy as the Japanese lines."
Pigout,Real new york style food. It's so delicious.Every food is tasty clean. small space but food is real good.!!!
Easy and convenient,"The Seoul subway has been a lot easier than I could have expected to use. Clean, convenient and fast. The only thing I can't cope with is how warm it is down there lol"
Good service but slow,"Compared to London the trains are less frequent and it takes longer to get anywhere! The stations were easy enough to navigate though, 80% of the time."
Better than in Europe,"Travelling with the metro in Seoul is a very special experience. Allthough it is a +20 million city travelling is not such a problem as you should expect, mainly because of the discipline of the local populateion and the many metro officers who will help a smooth operation. And by the way, free wifi is for free in all stations!"
The best way to tavel through Seoul,"The Seoul Metro is far better than a means to get around Seoul. Not only is it is the most reliable means, it connects to stations that can take you to anywhere in South Korea with rail service.From my first visit to Korea in Nov '88 in the days of only four rail lines, to my most recent in Nov '16, it has evolved to one of the finest in the world. There are going to run out of colors to name the numerous lines..."
Clean and on time,Its a HUGE subway system and the station names are a mouthful but subways are same same around the world. Go on be game! It'll save you time and your feet 
"Beware, not all stops are in English ","Seoul Metro is clean and user friendly sometimes. Not all stops are in English, but if you are watching on google maps when you should be expecting a stop it usually works out. Use a T-Money card if you plan on using the public transit at all. "
Good,Easy find......if u have app subway of koreaEnjoy your vacation First time U must ready by yourself
Lotsa walking and too many lines,"Korea has a complex metro system but it's highly reliable. There are many interchange stations and be prepared for extensive walking and climbing of stairs. Not easy to find elevator and escalator in the stations. If you are travelling with kids or elderly, it's easier to take the cab. Train cabins were packed during weekends. If you intend to lug heavy luggages to take airport train back, i would highly recommend the airport bus instead. T Money left cannot be used in Incheon airport transit area except for Starbucks. If you intend to keep the cute T Money card, utilise it at the nearest convenience store or take the airport bus ₩10000. "
The best transportation for pedestrian tour in Seoul,Seoul metro has 11lines with connection of satelite cities. Also metro provide one pass connected with public bus. Once you buy public transportation card you can use it for metro and bus. This card is very convenient because you just put the card on payment pannel in metro or bus. Please enjoy it.
Easy,Easy to get around with. Just ask for a map of the metro or look at the boards at the station. It wel get you where ever you want to go.
Good system but maybe confusing,"The Seoul train systems consists of train and metro. The routes are planned logically and connected to each other well. I believe the design was originallt from Japan as it is very similar to Tokyo system. The vending machine for tickets is good where you find multiple languages including English and Chinese. You pick youe destination and number of tickets and the machine will calculate the total cost. One time ticket gas a 500won deposit and you can get refund from a different machine at each exit. All most all stations have three level structure where the first floor is gound floor entrance and there are escalators to B1. At B1, it is the train station entrance where you check the map, plan your trip and buy tickets. Once you enter the station, you go to B2 to take the train. There are names and directions on the glass panel. The train will annouce stations for each stop, mostly in Korean and English. Once you are off the train, you either go one level up for exit or go to the connected corridor for transit except for some large stations where you need to go up and transit and go down again for anothet train. I lost a few times when I have difficulties finding the right exit or the ticket does not work if the exit is wrong. I eventually figure it out how it is set up and Never get lost. Large stations with multiple line transit could be confusing when you are first there and see Korean only."
Best way to get around the city!,Easy to navigate and the best way to get around the city. The stations and trains are clean and well maintained. Get your subway T money card and top up the money. Costs for a single journey are cheaper than subways on most other cities.There are plenty of signs in English so it's never difficult to find the correct exit for your desired destination at the station.
The best subway system in the world,"Seoul Metro arguably is the best subway system in the world. It continues to expand with 9 separate lines that covers around 180 miles in total length. The trains are newer and bigger that the ones in NY, London and Paris. Unlike Tokyo metro which has signs in Japanese only, Seoul metro provides English as a major foreign language with Chinese and Japanese signs as well. All the trains have good HVAC system, with excellent station information so that visitors can clearly understand where to disembark. The stations are equipped with glass wall/door to prevent from passengers falling to the tracks accidentally and to block all the headwind and dust as the train approaches the track. I thought that was a marvelous design and thought. The fare is very reasonable at $1.2 for basic one way charge. There are certain lines that connects to Gimpo airport and from Gimpo airport station, one can get on aboard a train to Incheon airport. From Seoul Yeok station, one can transfer to KTX bullet trains or from Suseo station, one can transfer to SRT bullet trains. One has tk purchase separate ticket for the bullet trains. "
Good way to visit places in Seoul,We hopped on and off at will. Almost every attracton was within walking distance from stations. The most annoying thing was that we needed to get card deposit refund for single trips purchased. 
good but wish there were better signage's in English,We travelled within Seoul a few times by the metro. It was simple like Singapore but only wish there were better signage's in English
Easy access and go,The Korean metro is provided nearly everywhere. I take a ticket to go to national museum of Korea. Very convenient and provides walkway from the museum to the metro.English is provided at the ticket machine. 
"Clean, dependable, conveniente","Seoul subway is great. Wide cars, I would say wider then in other cities. I always compare it with London tube which makes my claustrophobic each time i use it. I know it's old and all that, but still it's cramped, humid with no aircon... The signs in Seoul subway are in korean and English, everything is clear, easy no find. I gets very crowded in the morning and early evening when people finish work, but not in all areas of the city. Nowadays there's fewer people selling stuff inside the cars so it's good. All cars have wifi available. Aircon works well in summer, it can get a little too hot in winter with the heating on.Overall it's clean, dependable and very safe. Wish it was operating 24/7 but it's not gonna happen as all the taxi drivers would go on strike."
Why number 2?,"haha not to complain, but was pretty disappointed with Seoul Subway. I mean it works just fine and takes you places. But the subway itself is very dull. If you go to the wrong side (on some stations) you gotta call for help to let you out to switch to another platform. Trip starts at 1250Trip to airport takes roughly 1,5 hours and cost 4250. Certainly recommend this way to get to airport, very peaceful ride."
World class service,Korea metro is so convenient. It goes almost all the tourists attractions. And the interver is very short. I spent 40000won for 5 days.
Love the Metro.,"Love the Metro - get a Suica card for easy use of the trains. The subway maps look intimidating, but after awhile you can use the service like a local. "
Smooth and Efficient!,"We traveled everywhere in Seoul via the metro. It is efficient and smooth. We downloaded the app that is very accurate, tells you exactly when the metro is coming and what doors to enter through to make your next connection the most efficient. It is one of the best public transport systems I've ever used. Get the TMoney card at the airport, it is worth not having to waste time buying separate tickets and it is easy to load. "
Great to get around the city,"The Seoul metro system is very extensive and well-developed. Use a T-money card (purchase at any 7-eleven or other convenience store), load up with money at a recharge machine, and you just tap in and out at the gates. Minimum charge is 1200 won, after a few stops more will be added. At stations, exits are numerous, and in contrast to places like Hong Kong, outside at street level and very close to each other. Inside, stations are well marked in English, but outside the entrances can be hard to spot. If it's nice outside, and you're in the central areas, consider walking outside instead of going 1 or 2 stops. It's only a few blocks between stations, and you might come across something interesting. "
Great for getting around and easy,"Geared for tourists with English everywhere. The ""T"" pass is the card to use and can be purchased everywhere ""7"" eleven but no cash on the card, you need to load it at the Metro."
Easy Way to Get Around,"Just like most major cities, Seoul has a subway system. You can load up a T- Money card or just use the recycled cards. Either way, it's fast and easy to get around the city. Most of the train lines say the stops in English and Japanese in addition to Korean. The newer trains also shop stops in all three languages as well. Trains run fairly frequently in city center. The further out you get, the longer the time in between trains. Also rush hour can be a bit mad."
"Beautiful, cleanest metro in the world","It is hard to really get excited about a metro in a large city, but this system was clean and comfortable. Easy to get around with English on every sign. It was a great way to move about the city for very little cost. Truly was enjoyable. The train cars are a lot wider than any others that I have ever ridden. Almost too clean if that is possible."
"Clean, clear and friendly ","The Seoul metro is amazing. It all looks brand new. Clean, quiet, very clearly marked. No problem getting around and understanding where to go. Inside the train there are screens showing which station is now and which door to exit. A lot of the big stations are huge underground shopping areas. "
Reliable and efficient,"We stayed in seoul for 5 days and used the metro system as our main source of transport to get around. The system is efficient and reliable, signage within the stations are clear and accurate. Do note that it can get really crowded during peak hours and be prepared to get squashed by the crowd. If you are Travelling with young kids, do avoid the peak periods."
Great,"We use the metro in all our transportation, it was easy to use and we were able to reach all the desired places we wanted to visit. "
Easy with Google Maps!,"I'm generally a bad navigator, however, with the help of Google Maps, it advises you which bus to take & which stop to get off to reach your next destination."
"The way to get around Seoul, during 'normal' daylight hours","My wife and I used the T-cash card to ride the Seoul Metro. In a matter of a couple of days we could get around anywhere we needed to get to. It's good for almost all travel to and from the Incheon International Airport, from 5:30 am until midnight, at a fraction of a taxi fee."
Cheapish and regular,"Fantastic, easy to navigate tube system! Would recommend to anyone wanting to get around Seoul. There is always a tube station close to anywhere you want to go :)"
Give yourself extra time,"The coloured and numbered subways are great, but the stairs to the train going the correct direction can be confusing. Give yourself an extra 20 minutes to stumble through which direction the train is going. Some trains move on the left rail some on the right rail, so you cannot use that as a guide."
Easy to use,"Buy a card for 3,000 won at the vending machine and then top it up as one does with a London Oyster card. The trains were clean, on time and regular. Get a map as each line is colour coded. I found it really easy to get around. The Koreans were very helpful which was good as there isn't a strong presence of metro staff for those rare times of confusion."
Good Public Transport,You can travel anywhere with Metro. The announcements are available in English also. Clear Maps are available. A good alternative to taxis.
Clean and Efficient,"We opted to take the metro vs taxi while visiting Seoul.Seoul is a large city, but there is no neighbourhood that the metro cannot go to. We purchased Amazing Pay T Money Card when we arrived at Incheon Airport. This card can be used to take the Limousine Bus from the airport to your hotel destination. Then, from there this card can be used for the subway, bus, taxi, and even purchases at the local 7-11 or other grocery chains that accept this card.Taking the metro allowed us to avoid the congested streets of Seoul and travel to different neighbourhoods at a fraction of the cost we would have paid if we took the cab. It's a convenient way to see the city in a clean and air conditioned environment.All subway maps are in English so non natives can easily navigate through the different stations. Moreover, once you are in one of the cars, each station and which side to exist are announced in Korean, English and Japanese. You also have free wifi!Don't take the cab. Take the Metro!"
One of the Best Subway Systems,"The Seoul Metro system is one of the best I have used around the world - and I've been to many big cities! The lines are color coded and the colors are shown on platforms, too. When you need to change lines, simply follow the color of the next line you need at the interchange station and it will take you directly to the platform for the next line. It's so easy to use, you don't even need to speak or read Korean."
very good oranize easy to manage,"very well organized some line have announcements in double languages only, Others have english written names of stations"
"Clean, fast, but long walks","We were pleasantly surprised at the cleanliness, orderliness, and efficiency of the metro. The signage was easy to read and the announcements in English helped. Many Koreans speak English well and were kind and helpful. Long walks from ticket machines to the trains."
Ride to Incheon,"It was one hour on a train with free wifi. Clean and comfortable metro. They announce in English and in korean the next stop and tell you which side the doors will open. Also, they have little screen that tells you your stop in English and in Korean."
Easy to use,Getting around Seoul can be easy as long as you are connected to the net all the time. Make sure you you download the metro subway app when you visit Seoul to help you get around. Get a T money too which you can get at any convenience store. Google maps does not work well in Seoul except for transportation. Have seen reviews recommending Naver and Kakao maps but you need to understand how to read Korean.Have discovered Korea Tour app by Nuaa Inc. and it works well especially for those who prefer English only. You can partner the app with your Seoul Metro app to help you get around the City.
Efficient,"The train network is excellent and cheap. By using a 'travel card' it is more convenient by tap and go. However, platforms are very far away from entrance, typically 5 to 10 minutes walk is required. There are many stairs too, sometimes withourt escalator. It is likely the stations are also used for refuge in war time."
Efficient ,This was my first time taking a train of this calibre. I have to say it is easy to understand the routes and very efficient. 
Very easy to use,Used Seoul Metro a lot during a one week business trip. Very easy to use for English speaking traveler. Locals are very helpful to foreign travelers.
So efficient,We had no trouble navigating our way around the system. All signs are given in the English alphabet and the colour and number zones are easy to follow. Get a pass and keep adding money to it as you go. Very good value compared to London !
unrefundable T-money,"supposedly you can get the T-money refunded at the end of your stay but we never managed to do this - even the tourist information desk at Seoul station didn't have a good answer (they said we could get a refund at a convenience store, but none of the stores in the area would do it, they all said you have to go to the station to get the refund.) You can use the T-money card to pay for things at convenience stores, though, so this is probably the easiest way to use all the money up before you leave."
Not so easy,"Parts of the metro aren't all that new and although it's all very efficient and can whizz you around to all the city corners, it's not so easy on the feet. There are a LOT of stairs in every station and escalators and elevators are a rarity. The metro is not for anyone with mobility challenges. Buy a pass (although you have to pay for the card itself) as it will save time and cash."
Easy to navigate for foreigners,"I guess this is in comparison to China, but we found the metro to be great, easy to navigate, clean, stress free. "
Easy and Comfortable,"As a tourist, it is very easy to use seoul metro. Just buy T-Money for 2500won in convinience store and you can travel around Seoul. It will bring you to anywhere you want. Dont forget to use Subway app to see the subway map and the time table. Ohya, it's very on time!"
Good transport ,"Download the Seoul Metro App and you will have no problem traveling the subway. Very clean and quiet. If your flying any Korean, Asiana, or Jeju Air you can check in your luggage at Seoul station on level B2. Taking the nonstop train is cheaper than the buses, plus when you go through immigration at the airport you go through the diplomat security line at #6 in the airport and no waiting! Very good!!"
One of the Best in the world ,"Complicated as it looks on the map but it's not. Very comfortable, clean and not crowded train! You can access almost the whole Seoul and nearby cities in this reliable metro. Most of lines close at around midnight but better you check it out as it depends on which station are you. Seoul metro is one of the best in the world."
Super service! ,"Everything was very well labeled in english, chinese and korean (at least at those stations we were). "
first stasion that i went from incheon airport Seoul,"the train is very tidy, clean and not noisy, this kind of train is far more diffrent from indonesian trains. the service are good enough i think cause all the sign are friendly for tourist.. dont hesistate to try go somewhare with this train"
Easy to navigate around,"Easy to understand and navigate around seoul; at places where tourists frequent, they have labelled them in english."
So Well connected. Take note of exits and line numbers (not colours),"There are so many lines which means you can get to just about anywhere with it. Also means it takes a lot more effort to find the location on the subway map because there are so, so many lines and similar colorings that can cause confusion. There are also many exits in one station so be aware which exit you need to make."
A dream travel,"Is there any one word to describe different feeling?...We had a 4-day tour to Korea with our Tour Specialist Matt Cho and we felt, amazed, happy, enjoy, and satisfied.. there are still more but I think the review page is not enough. Our tour is not the normal tour that a normal first timer will do. What we had was making our KDrama addiction into reality and with the help of This Is Korea tour agency they allow us to customized our own Itinerary. They made sure that we will enjoy our stay. They are very accomodating and fast in answering my email inquiry. We requested to assign one of their good Tour Specialist but they assigned us one of the BEST TS -Matt Cho. He was very patience, jolly and knowledgeable. While driving, he was able to educate/share to us some of the history in Korea. We really enjoyed his company and we did not felt the language barrier since he speak english fluently. He is also funny and we feel his sincere concern and care while on tour. He is even going above and beyond his duty and task just to make sure that we are happy and fulfilled. In terms of time, he is very very punctual. He is always early from the actual call time and he knows how to maximize our time given the heavy traffic.He even made his own research for additional KDrama series and made sure to bring us at the location and capture the same exact shot.Matt and This is Korea is highly recommendable.Thank you for everything Matt.See you again.."
"Easy to use, efficient service.","Seoul Metro is an easy way to get around the city. The subway lines are numbered and colour coded, which is helpful for finding your destination and also, if you have to transfer lines.The trains make announcements in Korean, English, Chinese and sometimes Japanese. The KakaoMetro app is the best to use if you want to plan and navigate your journey, it tells you exactly where you need to go, even down to the carriage that it closest to exits for transferring. I strongly suggest purchasing a T-Money card from any of the convenience stores that are located all around Seoul. Do not rely on single issue tickets, it's not effective and should only be used in emergencies.Travel costs from one station to another is around 1,250 won, which is one of the cheapest modes of transport in Seoul. Trains are frequent every 5-10 minutes, depending on time and day of the week. They're also clean and fast, which is what is expected for such a large city. It really is the best way to navigate around Seoul, as buses can be slow due to traffic."
Easy to use,We bought a T Money card from the local 7 eleven shop. U need to pay a deposit on the card and it can b loaded with money at the same 7 Eleven. We got the map of the Subway system at the Airport Information Centre 
Very convenient metro system,"Seoul metro is easy to use and the map is pretty clear, although have to admit I am quite good with direction so can imagine a bit challenging at the beginning if you are not used to massive metro system network."
Best way to see Seoul,"Seoul metro is efficient, comprehensive and easy to use. We used TMoney to ride (just tap the card) which proved to be very convenient. Note though that some routes particularly the ones taking you outside Seoul like Nami and Busan do not accept TMoney. You need to get separate tickets for these trips. Bonus for me is the underground shopping available in almost every train station. You'll see a myriad of shops selling clothes, accessories and skin care products, all locally produced and much cheaper than branded stores around Seoul. "
Connects you from central to the rural side,"The train helped us maximize our time for tours. However, the train lines can get really confusing. We had to walk around 15 to 30 mins to the other side if we were in the wrong direction. If you have a roll-on luggage do not expect to easily find a lift or escalators. We had to carry our heavy luggage around and people are too busy to give a helping hand. Better travel light if you plan to commute via train with your luggage and just like in any other cities, avoid rush hour. I like the fact that it has an express trains too!"
Awful Ticketing System,"I purchased a ticket every time I used the metro, but the electronic ticketing is terrible. Several times I would go to transfer with a valid ticket and the automatic gates wouldn't open. If you ever miss a transfer or miss your stop good luck because the machines will not let you go back without buying another ticket. One of the machine dispensers wouldn't even sell me a ticket because it wouldn't accept anything other than 1000 won bills."
easy to navigate,"Easy to navigate and signs are written in English. Well organized, and clean. Most trains have a car with less AC (good to avoid in summer)"
"Easy, cheap and clean transportation on the Seoul Metro.","The Seoul metro was remarkably easy to maneuver all around the town. There was never a time we needed to transfer trains more than once in over a week. If you get a t-money card when you first get there and load it up you almost never need to worry about running short. And it can be used for taxis and mini marts all over town. The other recommendation is for the Seoul metro app (I used the iPhone app). It was helpful to plan while you are going to the metro, and will even tell you the easiest route if that is difficult for you. But the other helpful thing is if you walk around awhile you can use the app to tell you where to walk to get to the next station. Overall, the metro was amazingly prompt, frequent, and super clean. Very good experience."
One of the world's best ,I've used a lot of metro and this is one of the best. Very convenient. Many many lines and great interconnectivity. Usually can get seats unless it's rush hour. Very clean and quiet. Lots of announcements and electric signs. Many exits with english points of interest at each sign.Price is ok. Usually 1250 KRW but occasionally more. Buy a T Card from a 7/11 or station vending machine. Honestly it made my cuty experience much better 
Hands Down the Best Metro System,The Seoul Metro system is huge! With over 20 lines now you can get to most places around Seoul and beyond by using the subway. The fares are cheap starting at 1250 won a person per trip. You can use a T-money card on any type of public transportation which is super convenient. The trains are clean and people respectful for the most part. When in Seoul you should use the Metro system!
"Efficient, clean and cheap","The best way of moving around the city. Cheap, clean and efficient. All stops in English and Korean, some lines in Japanese and Mandarin. Buy a T-money card at any station,and top up as you need in the same machine."
Mr,Quick and efficient. And I like the idea of recycling. You return your ticket you get quarter of it back
Efficient,"Easy to navigate, prompt and comfy. Safe. Clean and quiet. Single trip tickets requires a deposit but refundable."
Seoul metro is clean and efficient,"The Seoul metro is easy to use. You purchase your tickets (cash only) based upon the distance travelled. A deposit for each ticket is charged, but this is refunded to you using the special deposit return machines at your destination. The only negative is the large distance between metro stops compared to the subways that we have used in NYC, Paris and other cities."
Surprisingly easy,We didn’t go far so we always got the minimum ride per person. I like the frugality mode of returning your ticket to get your deposit back.
Easy,"The Seoul metro is great. Do not bother with taxis, you can get close to anywhere by metro. We wasted 65,000 taking a cab from the airport to Insadong on our arrival. The trip back was easy by metro and only cost 8,500 for the both of us."
Fast ,Fast and trains are very compatible rates are very low we can use very simple Forigin peoples can use very easy...
Fast and easy,The subway is so efficient and easy to use. It is tourist-friendly as it has English sign boards. There is also announcement made in English inside the train and a LED tv displaying the destinations in English. Very convenient. 
Very Convenient And Cheap.,I took the metro everywhere. The service made it easy to get around at a very reasonable price. Ease of connectivity between different lines. 
Easy to use,The subway is easy to use. It is clean with clear signage in Korean and English. There are lots of toilets which are well maintained and some drinking fountains. I recommend getting a T money card to make traveling hassle free.
Seoul Metro Review,"Very well designed. Possible to find metro map, travel and station information everywhere in metro and train, in English. Possible to understand which exit to use. All is mentioned clearly. Fast and easy means of transportation in Seoul city."
Convenience Travel around Seoul,The subway system is easy to access. Almost similar like other subways system worldwide.Waiting time for each subway approximately around 5 minutes.Instruction & announcement come in Korean & English made it easy for foreigner.If you not travel heavy using subway or other public transport not advisable to purchase the T-Money.It easy to purchase single trip ticket. 
Handy way to move,"Moder, neat, tight network around Seoul. Exits are marked rather well but as a tourist it would be nice that the nearby exit hotels would be marked as well. T-Money cards can be bought on stations. The maps are also available everywhere. For a elderly persons they printed with a very small text. "
Very Efficient Subway,Having visited Korea multiple times our family always enjoyed taking Seoul Metro to explore and visit places of interest. Do download the mobile app MetroidHD that guides you from station to station including the time frame and total cost. Also remember to purchase a metro card from any convenient store to tap in and out if stations at a lower rate. Enjoy your journey and be safe.
Beat the traffic with Seoul Metro,Traveling to and from different neighborhoods and countrysides in Seoul is a breeze because of their train system. I'd still choose trains over buses or cabs.
Korean Metro,"The metro in Seoul and Busan are efficient and well connected. They have announcement in Korean, Japanese and English. This is an advantage for foreign visitors who cannot soeak Korean. The numbering system for each stop also helps in reaching my destination. It will definitely help if more Enflish or Chinese signage can be placed in the station for directionand transfer. More escalators installed for the elderly and people with walking disabilities is appreciated."
You can save money by using it ,"Great connection and excellent for money ,, and there is some adding English there , but negative part you can 't see any thing while you underground's, so last 2 days start taking taxi just to see live , street and things around cause in metro you simply not seeing any thing "
Most efficient metro on the planet,I love Seoul Metro.They get you everywhere you need to go and they're so clean and efficient. And I'm willing to bet they're one of the most accessible metros in the world. I wish London's metro was as wheelchair accessible as Seoul's is.
Would have rated it excellent if...,"Would have rated it excellent if...escalators or lifts were more easily accessible. For families with strollers, travellers with huge luggages or handicapped passengers, the metro would prove to be a little bit of challenge as we encountered more stairs than escalators. Otherwise, the entire metro system n network is extensive, making it very cheap and easy for tourists to explore the city."
Bad Traffic in Seoul,"If you have to go from one end of town to the other end of town, you might want to consider taking the Seoul Metro. Traffic is very heavy in Seoul. And not during rush hour. And even worse on Saturdays. Sure if seems a little confusing at first, but once you get the hang of it, you will be taking the Metro more and more. Who wants to sit in bumper to bumper traffic all day on your vacation????"
Anyeonghaseo!!! ,Cherry blossoms is my favourite part of my Korea trip... This place is beyond beautiful no words to describe.. the cleanliness and food. Very busy the time we were there but it’s ok. You just have to be strong so that you can take a nice picture of yours anyways you should visit seoul.. you will definitely tell yourself that you have to be back!!! ❤️❤️
Life saver,The metro in Seoul is one of the best that I have ever been on. It is so easy to use and navigate and is very English friendly. I had translations with me and never had to use them once because I could read all the signage. The exits always seemed to be close to where I wanted to go so I never had to walk very far once exiting the stations either. I would highly recommend getting a T-money card and taking the subway to get around Seoul for both locals and tourists. 
"Clean, efficient and integrated with other mode of transportations",Easy to learn and to ride. Although less English language but still easy to understand. Has the looping green line whenever you need it or got lost. Buy T-money card anywhere to start ride.
A few days in Seoul ,Metro is a great way to get around in Seoul. It is easy to buy tickets anywhere and easy to refill with money.The maps and signage are also easy to follow.Goes to both airports as well.
It helps to learn a little Korean,"Very easy to navigate. It definitely takes a fee turns to make it easy, but I believe that was all from the language barrier. "
"Not much English, but still easy to use","We used the metro to travel 23 stations across the network, including one line change, in afternoon peak,and it was pretty easy.Buying the ticket at the machine was straight forward, requiring you only to enter your destination. Fares are very low. The lines are colour coded, which makes things pretty simple. We had a subway map written in Korean, so we could recognise the stations we passed.For some of our trip, the carriages were packed tight. Everyone concentrated hard on their mobile devices & didn't interact with other passengers. However, as it was obvious we were non Korean speaking visitors, a number of local people asked if they could help us, and some others were keen to practice their English on us--the overall impression was one of politeness & friendliness. Our trip lasted about 80 minutes. It was smooth & trouble free. As long as you know the station you are going to, & where to change lines, its a straight forward process & enables you to avoid the pretty horrible peak hour traffic in Seoul."
As easy as it can get!,"One of the best transportation mode in hustling & bustling streets of Seoul. Easy to use and has connection to almost entire city and sometimes out of city as well. Do buy a metro card (T Money with CVS4U), recharge and vroooom... Just travel and enjoy. Taxi is expensive and traffic is sometimes nauseating so Metro is the best way to move around the city hassle free. Has connections to Public buses as well. Closes at around 11:55 PM.Cheers,BokaBoy"
Economical and faster trasportation,"There are many subway lines in Seoul, which makes complicate to visitors.It is economical to move on Metro from one place to another because you don't need to pay too much money, only pay excess fee less than 20% or no without howmany times you trasfer Metros at one time. It is convinient to get in or off because there will be announcement or any sign in the monitor where you are. And you can enjoy free wifi in Metro all the times. But you have to walk a little to get Metro or transfer another line and it will be crowded at commute time."
Excellent way to get around if you have the app,"The metro in Seoul is super efficient and clean. The prices are very low and if you buy a metro card, remember to turn it back in at the end of the ride in the machines and you'll get a refund on a portion of the ride. Not a bad deal.The metro lines are clearly marked and the metro appears to go just about everywhere in Seoul, so you'll be able to get to where you want to be quite easily. You may have to change lines a few times, but if you follow the app and the signs, you'll be fine.The trains themselves are fairly clean and the people file in/out very quickly. Do not take too long getting on/off, or you may get trapped. The announcements on the train are written in English and Korean, so you'll know where you're stopping next and if you need to transfer or not. Additionally, the trains have little arrows on the signs to let you know which side will open at the next station, so you can preposition to get off.Overall, this was a great and affordable way to get around Seoul if you had some time and wanted to avoid rush hour traffic. I still preferred the taxi system, but that may not be the best choice, depending on time of day and distance."
convenient and cheap with T-money card,"It is cheap and convenient for backpackers. However, some stations are quite far. But it is ok cuz the scenery in Seoul is nice for some walk. Need to check the exit for better experience. "
"Clean, Cool, Easy, Efficient!","Though my most recent visit was in August 2017. I have used the Seoul Metro to get around the city at various times over the past six years.It's quite easy for an English-speaker to grasp & utilize effectively (including transfers to other lines) so give it a whirl if you're unsure. Three trips in, you'll be a pro!Rated against Paris or London, Seoul's metro system FAR exceeds for newness/cleanliness of the trains/stations.I've also been engaged in very charming conversations while waiting for trains in Seoul - often with grandparents pushing little kids up to me to practice speaking English, while they beamed proudly from a few feet away! You just don't get that level of interaction with locals by taking a taxi. Safe, easy & efficient, the Seoul Metro is your best value transit around the city."
One of the best metros in the world,"Fast, clean, and usually punctual, Seoul's subway system is one of the best in the world. They do end service fairly early considering how late many Koreans stay out at night. "
Best subway lines in the world,"Very easy to understand. It takes from point A to Z without any conflicts. Subways and buses do a great work.together. They are reliable and very easy to use. Buy a T-money card, you can reload them anytime and they are accepted in any subway and bus station."
Great and clean subway,"I took the subway multiple times during my 2 weeks stay in Seoul. It is very clean. If you travel a lot I recommend to buy a subway card , available in the mini markets in the hall, which you can reload at every station. If you only buy one way tickets keep in mind that there is a deposit on those cards so you can get a refund if you return them. "
Great way to get around ,If you don't want to take cabs and pay a lot it's a great way to get around and not expensive at all! Definitly recommend! 
 Fantastic!," You can purchase a T card just about anywhere. The card is good for subway, bus, taxi, and some convenience stores. Download the app MetroidHD to help you navigate. Be sure to rent an egg in airport for wifi... completely worth the $9/ Day. Entire subway is clean and well labeled in English. "
Vast and convenient,"It is the most vast network I have seen.Even connects to some areas where you can go hiking in nearby mountains.It is clean, cooled and heated during the seasons, people are polite..."
Single female traveler,"Very busy but easy to navigateBuy a Suca card which you purchase outside stationSome other travellers advised it can be brought online before leaving homeLoad money on then you can use on trains, vending machines and taxisTrains run very regularly and very safeHardest part finding exit as large shopping complexes underground"
One of the best Metro around the world.,"Seoul has 10 million people living there, the government took very good care for Metro Seoul to offer best service, connections are huge, I believe over 16 lines are moving across the city , it's very clean and very good prices, with less than two dollars (KRW1500) you can move between stations, even once you leave you can return the card and get back (KRW500), I moved from a station near by Grand Hilton to Bukchon Hanok Village, very easy, and also moved to Eta1 station, as well it was comfortable.Really I advice all travelers to Seoul to use the Metro, it's really easy."
So clean,It's not to difficult for a foreigner to figure things out. The whole system is clean and safe. Leave your car a travel a great subway system
Good and reliable metro trains,"We flew into Gimpo airport from Jeju and took the metro to Seoul downtown. The metro subway was very easy to use, fairly inexpensive and we visited most of the tourist attractions using the metro. There were 9 subway lines in Seoul, excluding the airport lines and other sub lines. The easiest way to travel is to use a T-money card to avoid the hassle of buying paper tickets. You can top up the T-money card at the stations as well as many other places. We even went to Nami island using the metro trains."
Best transportation in Seoul,The metro is the best way to get around in Seoul city fast Clean aircon in summer and heating in Winter just buy o t-Money card and load on some casch. in 7-eleven you can buy the card 
Easy but........,"Seoul Metro is the easy to use and you can go anywhere.good option for the Traffic.But,some routes using the bus is better.If you have problem the staff will help you. I try it fromMeyodong near my hotel to Iatewon and Woman university shopping area.Also,it is clean with comfort seat.There are lift for disable and strollers.you should try it."
"On time, reasonable price, great service.. for ME","Great for me during congress in Gangnam-gu Sep17. Easy to use, clean, once you work out system (easy) it is great"
Easy to use,"The metro is super easy, so you can go anywhere you want fairly easy. The machines for the passes only take cash. If you are in the city for a few days I believe you can get a metro pass at the convenience store that last a few days."
Seoul Metro Adventure,"The Seoul Metro, for someone who doesn't live there, can seem quite daunting. Whenever I visit Seoul, the lines I usually use are 3, 4, 5, 6, 9. The last time I visited Seoul, my friend and I traveled from the Express Bus Terminal station to Itaewon. For that, one needs to transfer lines in Yaksu. Later in the afternoon, we took the metro from Yaksu to Hyochang Park and made our way to Yongsan station on foot. It was not difficult to do at all, nor far. Our end destination was Youinaru to go to the ferry. It was a lot of searching and required an acute awareness of stops. Some people helped us along the way. It was rush hour, too, so the subway cars were packed full, nowhere to sit.After our ferry ride, we decided to take the metro back to the Express Bus terminal. Fortunately, it was just one transfer then one straight line of seven stops. In our fatigued state from the days' activities, that was a small relief. In general, the subway is easy to use, as long as you are careful to know which direction you are heading in and which stop to get off at. There are seats reserved for the elderly, physically challenged and pregnant women. And there are elevators available at most stops. To have an easy at-your-fingertips subway map, download one of the apps. I used the one Seoul Subway by MyWay. It sufficed."
The Easiest Way To Go Everywhere,"Seoul Metro is the easiest if you want to go around Seoul. There will always elevator if you are bringing luggages, lockers that you can find in most of the station. Just be aware some places, you might need to go by stairs."
Clean and clear,Very organized and easy to follow. English writings everywhere and polite staff for helping. Buy transportation card for concession and fast moving
One of the cleanest in the world,Very clean decks and cabinesA lot of information desk officersClear signs and state of the art Metro
Easy to use,All Metro is written in English and has a number which get it mire easy to use. In addition that each train has a tv that is written next station in both languages. Very easy to use.
World Class,"How can you not appreciate clean, modern air conditioned stations? The Seoul Metro is user friendly and serves most of Seoul so incredibly well. Having come from Manhattan, you can almost eat off the floors of the Seoul Metro stations. The stations have varied and interesting eateries and shops to boot. There are no rats nor the ear smashing screeching of the wheels. The cars have access for bikes and variated temperatures for air conditioning in the summer."
The World's Best!,"With a population of almost 10 million people, Seoul is a huge city and the smartest way to get to around it is to take the Metro! Modern, clean, efficient and most importantly safe, the Seoul Metro is noted as the best in the world. The metro safely transports millions of people every day on a very timely manner. It's also very inexpensive. Stops, along with attractions, are very clearly marked in Korean and English. The best part??? There's WIFI! Seoul is simply amazing!"
Convenient,"Even though it can get kinda crazy during rush hour, It was so convenient that it didn't really matter. Most of the stations even had AC because they know it gets hot in Korea and when you are in a space with a lot of people, it can get even hotter.There are many apps you can download that will help you get fro point A to point B, but even without it, you can get around by following the signs and maps."
Quick and easy metro system!,"The Seoul metro is amazing, and easy to navigate. We used a T-Money card, and added to it several times over our week there. Once you have the basics down, it's pretty easy to get around, and the maps in the stations are good, posted everywhere the trains run. Make sure you don't stay out too let though, as they close up at midnite."
Seoul metro,So many lines but it was friendly public transport. Fare is ok. T money is like a prepaid card. Can top up in most convenient shop. Also get discount if use t money compare purchase ticket tru machine daily.
Very user friendly and safe!,I always feel safe traveling via subway in Seoul and very easy to navigate to pretty much all of Seoul. Also very clean!
Very straightforward after you work out the initial stages,"You have to pay a ""deposit"" of 500 won for your card and then you pay the fare on top - you can get your money back when you've finished with traveling at the refund machine at the station. Always a good idea to count the stops in case you can't see the name of the station but this is shown inside the train as well."
Easy! But lots of walking,"Easy to get almost anywhere in the city- even as far south as Pyeongtaek or Choenan. Clean, inexpensive, but can be long walks with lots of stairs. Some websites/directions don't give the best exit advice, but world class subway!"
Fast,The track is so fast. I like it.i went to Suwon with my friends they were also so happy about it. It takes around 24 min to reach there from Yeoungdeungpo. The express train were so fast and luxurious.
get ur self a map,ppl here walking fast as fast as their train. if you not sure which station to go you can simply ask to their customer service. they will help you. or just get the map to make sure you dont go to the wrong direction.
"Do not rent a car, save the money and be with the people.","We traveled to Seoul for 8 days, knew little about the Seoul Metro but had heard good things. They know how to do it, from rotating Korean to English instructions about the stops, monitors that show the location of the approaching train, and an inexpensive method to get around any area of Seoul and even outlying cities. We have travelled Europe and Japan by train and feel that the Metro in Seoul is one step ahead as they match the cleanliness and efficiency but the people are a bit more friendly. I saw a review in which someone raised the concern for English speakers, I would reject that notion completely as all maps and the monitors include English instructions and notifications on a rotating basis. I will gladly use the Metro, no need for a car and after some of the driving I witnessed during a bust tour of the DMZ I am glad we will not be renting a car in the future."
Very easy to navigate,"Koreans,we found in general, are leery of telling tourists to take the Metro but it truly is VERY easy to navigate. download the city rail app onto your phone and it allows you to determine the proper train to take for your destination. A plus of this app is that you need not be connected to WIFI to use it."
Rail metro in seoul,Friendly travel by metro...Cover almost all places in seoul...Safe journey... less crowded... Good experience
"Very modern. But huge, complex, and crowded. ","The Korean language makes this a very difficult system to navigate for English speakers (unless you speak Korean of course). It's hyper modern in some places and just ok in others. It's massive. The stations are massive and require a lot of walking. Be sure to download the subway app so you can plan the route, and count stations or you are likely to miss yours as many names sound almost identical, and English signage is small. "
"Really effectiv, but hard to figur out","Like the tittle says its really effectiv but hard to figur out. I recommed downloading kakometro app. if you havent vistes the location before. Its really clean and safe in the trains, but be carful for packet train you will feel like a stardine in a box"
Best Metro System,Was very surprised by how high tech Seoul Metro System is. Confusing at first but learned quickly to get around. Very clean and well maintained.
Fast and cheap ,Very useful to travel arround The City. If you are lost u can always check the information for tourists kioske or the map 
Best mode of transportation within Seoul City to most tourist attractions,"Please use T-Money to save money and save the hassle of buying tickets for each trip. You can figure out what train to take by looking at the following : line number (or color), next station, last station of that line. However, please get ready to make a lot of walking, because some stations don't have escalator and the lift can be hidden or very far. This can be a big challenge for tourists with big luggage and mobility difficulty."
Good,Easy to access many places in central of Seoul and even suburbs. But some branch seems quite difficult to access because they all in Korean. Need more guidance in English language.
Efficient convenient,During My whole visit I used subway exclusively. System covers all of the attractions quite well.Only problem is if you try to go with heavy luggage as some of the stations don't have escalators. The lift for wheelchair was out of work in city hall station during the 4days I spent near there.
"world class metro system which is well maintained, spotless and affordable","we took the metro everywhere during our stay and were most impressed. it has a stop for the key attractions. we did not have to join a tour as we gained access to them via the metro. we paid 1450 won single trip to most sights! we just have to know the station's code to purchase the ticket from the machine. it is most user friendly. there is also a refund machine by the exit for the ticket deposit of 500 won. so, do not throw away the ticket. it is the most well planned metro network in the world! each station even has emergency supplies stored in visible and accessible area. highly recommend. "
On-time train service with easy to read signs and english instructions,"Not much to say, cheapest way to get around. You get a refund if you return the metro card you buy at the end of your trip. "
Quick and easy,I used the metro many times during my visit to Seoul on business. It is quick and easy to use with announcements being made in English as well as Korean. There are lots of notices guiding you in the right direction - it is often important to choose the correct exit. Buying tickets is easy from machines at every station - instructions are in English. Notes are accepted and change given.
Clear and Convenient,"The instructions and guidelines are clear, the station names is shown by Korean, English as well as Chinese. The subway reaches many famous tourist sight-seeing spots and it is very convenient. Like many subway build-in in other countries, that elevators are not easily found in every exit in Korea subway system. It would be helpful if more elevators can be placed to facilitate passengers to travel more easily with luggage."
Convenient and very clean,Very useful as there are a lot of lines and stops.Very clean and very convenient even if you don't know how need to buy cards/tickets the first time.
"Great, clean, efficient and cheap",One of the best I have ever used. Get a T-Money card which can be loaded with money (only cash can be used at the machines) and use it to touch in and touch out after every journey. Allows to transfer to buses and other lines for free within half an hour.English signage available so it will not be a problem to navigate it. Download an app with the subway map.
Very easy to use.,You will not have any problems in seoul metro system if you know english and have a good scenes of direction.
Efficient,Efficiency is the key to why I always take this metro wherever I go. Very convenient and easy to understand directions. 
Seoul Metro,"Good and efficient. Very on time and fast. Used it extensively going from Coex to Myeongdong, Namdaemn, Naryangin fish market, Seoul station, Dongdaemun toys street, Insadong ... But going through Express Bus Terminal station is a pain - full of people, hard to board and hard to exit the train during the peak hours. Once even nearly could not exit. Nobody was willing to even budge half an inch - some even push you back!"
Great way to get around,One of the easier subway systems we have travelled on on the worldWithin the main metro area there is a standard fare of 1350 won (about $1.60 AUD) for a single trip ticketYou pay another 500won deposit which is refunded at the trip end by putting the ticket into a designated machine. A novel way to prevent littering. The trains announce which station is next and it is shown on the train in both English and KoreanTrains run every few minutes and if you look like you are struggling the Korean people are very friendly and will either offer to assist or if you ask them will try to assistHaving being caught in a couple of traffic jams in the taxis the train is a far better and efficient option
"Hot platforms, slow trains","Compared to the other subway systems in Asia (Japan, Taiwan, China, HK, Singapore), Seoul needs work. The platforms are difficult to access, requiring long slogs through byzantine stations with poor English signposting and endless stairs (the subway stations double as bomb shelters, FYI). Trains can be unbearably slow - I waited 35 minutes for a regional feeder subway to the main subway line after traveling east from Dongdaemun by <10 stations.Access via cashless cards is OK, but as a non-Korean, costs were difficult to interpret."
Easiest English-Friendly Public Transit System,"I've travelled around the world quite a bit, and Seoul's system is easy to navigate and gets you wherever you need to go at an affordable price. With each ride at W1250, it's cheap and easy to get places. Also very English-friendly - you can literally look anywhere (up, down, left or right) and find some kind of subway map and directions in both English and Korean. Also the numbered entrances / exits make it easy to get out and know exactly which direction you're heading in. Enjoy!"
Convenient,"Typical subway for a modern city. Not too many complaints. Sometimes the wait between trains is long, but the ride is comfortable and safe. "
An experince,"Although it can be crowded sometimes, it is quite convenient and efficient. It connects most of this huge city and it is intuitive to use even for westerners. "
"Complex map, but rather intuitive to use","We used the Metro several times. In comparison to Tokyo, the system is probably not as easy to navigate, but since the map is very complex, it is surprising how easy it is to ticket and find your way about. Highly recommend over the WAY inferior cabs in the city, many of whom will pick you up then refuse to take you somewhere because they do not know where it is."
The best transportation in Seoul.,"Does the job, easily, cheap and not too confusing. Mind the rush hours, but even they are doable. Only thing is the closing of metros at midnight, and Uber not being allowed in Seoul, but it's ok."
Very convenient,"The metro is very easy and understandable in Seoul. Just don't hesitate. It's much cheaper than taxi. Just buy a T card, put some money on it and off you go.Best way to discover the city."
One of the most convenient and clean railways in the world,"Easy to access and easy to alert which station is which. The broadcasting in the trains and platforms are clear enough. The train compartments are very clean and the air-conditioning is good. For more convenient to you during the trip, I suggest you to buy a value-added ticket, it can be reused in your future South Korea trips."
Best way to get to where you want to,Seoul has a nice metro network. It is very clean punctual and fast. Best way to get around the city.
Awesome system,"Taking the metro in Seoul is very easy. Everything is in English even the tickets machines have multiple languages to choose from.Best to buy a T Money card which you can use for the metro, bus, purchases at convenience stores etc. Your ride on the metro is also discounted by like ₩100 each trip."
"Excellent, reliable, clean, user friendly, cheap","It was four of us using the metro for a period of 2 weeks. We needed reliable and cheap transportation to go back and forth from Seoul to Osan. We had a plan to visit a number of sites, and were glad to have had such a reliable way to commute safely. Our son who lives in Korea explained the basics to us, so thankfully, we were able to learn the ropes. Riding the metro in Korea is an excellent way to see the country, to observe the culture and to learn about the way of living in that country. We all thought it was quite convenient and cheap. While the metro was convenient and great to move about, we were amazed how unfriendly Koreans were on the metro in general. Not willing to talk to people or help when we asked questions, not very friendly at all. Compared to other cities we've visited around the world, this was disappointing. They don't even talk to each other! Weird! However, given how well instructions are made available to users, the ease with which we can buy the tickets and read information, how good the system is with regard to punctuality, we highly recommend using the Seoul metro. Excellent!"
convenient,"The Seoul subway is the best one I have ever taken in my life.It's so convenient, peaceful and calm. People are actually very polite on the subway. You can't scream, it's forbidden. (and i totally enjoy it)The subway is always on time! It's incredible! "
Easy to find help,"Very good, very fast, very clean. You will get subway map in every good hotel. Soul streets are very busy, consider subway when you need to go to the Airport (Incheon), because Incheon is another city."
Clean and on time,The subway in Seoul is one of the best in the world. It is safe clean and on time. Airco is also perfect during the summer. You just buy a card and very easy to recharge. Machines are available at every station.
Convenient ways of transport,"Seoul metro is well organized ensuring all lines are connected so you always reach your destination. A note for Seoul station: they should organise some elevator especially for AREX line because we travellers usually carry heavy lugguage, so carrying the suitcases from platform to platform is devastating work. "
Easy to use,Once you figure out the routes it is easy to use and cheap. There are several aps that can help you plan your start point and ending point. Trains can be crowded so be prepared to stand. Get a T money card to use as you go. Signs and announcements in Korean and English. 
Huge !!,"Difficult on the first days but after ok.Very clean, there is not one paper on the floor.Can find also toilet in every subway station dor free.Free plastic for umbrellas at all entrance of subway station when it s raining...!You pay for each trip on cash at automatic machine or get a card at convenient store, then charge it"
It is just a metro,"Why is this number 1, it is just transportation. You know, people come in sit down and get out at their stop. Go and see actual tourist sites. "
A modern and efficient metro system,"The metro system in Seoul is very effective and efficient and most parts of the city (including the two airports) are covered by this network. Further, the ticket price is quite reasonable. It is advisable to book a hotel near a metro station so that you can easily and effectively arrange your travel in Seoul."
EXCELLENT !!,"Seoul Metro are perfect. You can visit all the tourist places with the Metro. Is very clean, fast, safe, with air conditioner, has a lot of lines.For Us the Seoul Metro are one of the best of the world."
A big and convenient network,"Seoul Metro offered a big and convenient network for visitors to travel around Seoul. The fare is expensive if we just travel for one station. The positive thing is that the train is never full of people during my visit. The negative thing is that it requires a lot of walking up and down stairs inside the stations. There are insufficient escalators and elevators in the stations. Or say, it is not disabled person or stroll friendly."
Getting around without the traffic,"I used the metro last year as well as my present trip. Downloading the korea subway app is a big help. You can purchase a card at the CU stores that can be charged for trips and not pay for tickets every time using the metro. Every time I used the metro it was crowded. However, the drive into Seoul from where I was working is more than $20 in tolls. So its a big saving in time and cost. Enjoy!"
Glad Hotel,This hotel location was very close to National Assembly station in Yeouido. My son and I loved it. I recommend this location.
Easy to navigate,"Seoul metro is based on coloured lines and is very easy to navigate, change lines etc. Trains come every few minutes and signs are in English"
very easy to use subway,"Seoul subway is straightforward, easy to use. i don't remember if they have a daily pass or not, but this subway is definitely easier than japan's! download the ""subway korea"" app on your phones. it can display how many stops, where to alight and the time taken. there are often convenience stores in the subway station."
Well-connected network,"It may need more than two line changes occasionally, but on the whole the network is extensive enough for commuting around Seoul, even without the buses. Avoid the rush hours if you can. Always look at the exit maps; they help greatly with deciding which exit to take to get to where you want to go. Comparable to the best in the world!"
Great and easy,The subway of Seoul is connecting every place there with easy access. My experience with my family was great. 
"On time,.clean.","Very convenient mode of transportation here in Korea. You don't have to go.On a tour honestly as the attractions are very accessible by metro. It's clean and the map is easy to read.Each ride costs you about 1,500Krw one way. Please ensure you know which direction you're going to because if you wanna switch over, you have to tap out then in again, paying again! Get your T-money card at the airport or any convenient stores. Expect a lot.of pushing here by the locals.There is a seat dedicated to pregnant women and elderly. You can sit there when they're not there but you'd still get stares. Not sure if.I'm sitting there or just cause I'm a foreigner "
KTX K Rail Train to Busan,"Rode the K rail train from Seoul to Busan and back. First class on the way down with quite large and comfortable seats, but I would advise saving $20 and booking economy. I booked online and couldn't figure a way to book a particular seat. Each first class row has two window seats and one interior; mine was interior. Unfortunately most of the locals pulled the shades, which you can partially see through but with a somewhat obstructed view. The views really aren't that spectacular. The economy class, which I booked for my return trip, rows are four across with ample legroom. Busan was a bit underwhelming for me. I enjoyed Seoul a lot more."
Great way to get around,"After reviewing the subway system, it was a breeze. If you plan to ride it all the time get a refillable metro card at the any convience store. Download the subway map app."
Best way to travel in Korea!,"The Metro in Seoul is an exciting place full of underground shops and restaurants, unlike the Metro in the US, such as the ones in New York, Chicago, or Boston: their underground subways are very dangerous and depressing. We took the subway everywhere in Seoul. It was affordable and fast with no traffic to worry about. However, if you are traveling with a luggage, I suggest not taking the subway as most locations only have stairs. Also, if you are in a party of three or more the prices do add up and it may actually cost less to grab a cab."
Very comfortable long distance trains with good amenities,"I am not sure whether what we travelled by were long distance KR Trains or Metro, but we had gone from Seoul to Yeous and back in the fast railways. The experience was amazing. From the very neat and clean railway station to trains and its toilets, with disposable seat covers, it was a treat to travel in it. The seating and coaches were more roomy and comfortable than economy class tickets of normal planes. The speed was up to 325 KMs/Hour and scenery outside were so pleasing to eyes. All the stations were like a mall and full of amenities and facilities. Overall, I find them a much better trains than in India or China and even France. Thumbs up. "
rapid and efficient,"I am always very impressed by the speed and efficiency of the Korea transport system. The train arrival notification tune is definitely useful, coupled with the location of the train on their monitors at the platform. Very reliable information provided. I don't even need to take a cab. However, for the sake of elderly vistors, I hope Korea would replace the stairs with escalators at the subway station. I saw an elderly almost falling on my last visit and worry for her / them. "
Very convenient ,"The subway is cheap, safe and convenient. It is the best way to get around. Buy a TMoney card and get discount."
Cheap and Easy,"This is could be one of the best transportation you can hop around in Seoul and around Seoul. The best line should be the green and blue line since they are lots of tourist attraction : Gangnam, Hongdae, etc. The price is very cheap and recommending everyone to buy the Tmoney"
OK for quick travelling,"Good if you don't have access problems, but not recommendable for heavy luggage and strollers, as many stations don't have elevators all the way down to the platforms."
Everywhere and anywhere,amazing metro services in Seoul.Sometimes a little difficult to get it but once handled you can go anywhere
Helpful with cheap price,"The good thing about the subway is that you can choose an exit leading to your destination directly, the exits are in the main spots. You can NOT discover seoul without using the metro, t-money happen to be really easy to handle, you can get from any convenience store, recharge it there or in any machine in the metro stations.The metro is sometimes really crowded but it's ok coz it's fast and clean, the metro is so cheap"
A good system but tough exits,"Once you get off the subway, there can be up to 12 ways to exit! you can do a lot of walking once you get off and you need to know what # exit you want. Also, once you go down to the subway, you could be in for a very long walk. A good subway map will be a HUGE help. We rode it a lot for 2 days but we made sure we knew exactly where we were going, where we needed to get off and them what eixt # we needed. Also, we used it to get from our hotel to Incheon Airport and that was much cheaper than a bus and easy to navigate. If you give yourself time, you don't need the express which will save you money. The cars are clean but they can be crowded.Also, when we were there, it was very hot, humid,and stuffy in the terminals."
fast and easy,"Great way to get around, easy to use and figure out ! The kiosk people were helpful, English wasn't great but they tried and so did we! Only complaint is that not all stations were handicap accessible. We were trying with our grandpa, so we had to walk to certain stations to get access and some times we just walked."
Great way to skip the traffic,This is a very useful way to skip the busy traffic in Seoul especially if you are going from the gangnum area up to insadong area where the palaces are. It's very straight forward to take and buy tickets in English but i would suggest you download the app called city rail. You can then put in your starting and ending point and it will tell you the best way to go (there are lots of different lines and tourists would not know the best or quickest one). 
I love this metro!,"One of the most comfortable and clean subways in the world I think!You get along very easily even without knowing anything about the Korean language.The app ""Kakao metro"" is very helpful to know how long it takes to go from one station to another and which lines to take."
One of the top 3 metros in the world ,I've traveled a lot and this metro was amongst the best I've experienced! The only way to get around Seoul!!
A day tour in Korea ,Excellent tour guide Ju and Oliver fromColor of Korea. I would recommend their service to all my family and friends. 
A superb train network,"Seoul has an excellent subway network for travellers. However, the transit points always have many staircases to tread on. Luckily, with patient one can find an elevator! Hope the Seoul Metro can add more signs for the elderlies to go along. There is a small cabinet in each cab especial for elderlies and the local people are always in good manner and consciously avoid sitting on these 6 seats, 3 on opposite side and let the needed ones to use in priority. Do take advantage of the discount granted for transit points to save one's travel budget and timess."
Good Transportation ,The metro system is huge and the cars are clean but often crowded. I also like the little convenience stores in the middle. It was much like ant other subway system I have used.
Easy and Everywhere in Seoul,Train and Subway are super easy because of the signage. Get a T-card and load up T-money. You'll need a T-money card for each person who is traveling in your party.
An option if you want to stay away from rain and heat,"If you have been to Korea, you should know that map apps do not work in the country because of security reasons. I therefore always have the jitters when visiting Korea because of that and also their limited English proficiency. That said, I would say I prefer Seoul Subway systems than those are in Japan simply because its AC systems are much stronger and the English announcements are clearer.I like the fact that the routes and stops are color coded which has made our lives as tourists easier. Bring also your patience because there are times that you will be overwhelmed by the fact that they have limited English support and too many stops. But overall, it was an easy maneuver. Although the systems are old and poorly lit, it is affordable, quite efficient and clean (some stops are just next to each another, but it is not uncommon in Asia).At the end of the trip, do not forget to get the deposits back."
The double-door system (station door & train door) provides better passenger safety plus aircon comfort.,The Metro System is very efficient and the double-door system (station door & train door) provides better passenger safety. The provision of airconditioning system adds passenger comfort especially during humid months. May I suggest bolder and bigger font for English translations for street names and directions. We actually relied on city map and our daughter who is residing in South Korea for a scientific research program.
Sure we had to have a go,The metro is really well managed and run . The volume of people takes a bit of getting used to and getting pushed about but that as all part of the fun of travel . The place is designed also as a neuclear shelter just in case Kim fat ung decides he wants to chuck a few devices down south . Trains were clean and model and experienced no delays and the staff were friendly and helpful not like the London Underground . 
Convenient and Reliable,"Although one may get a little overwhelmed initially at the number of stops and lines, it is surprisingly easy to navigate with the help of apps such as Subway Korea. It also helps that all signs are in Korean, English, Chinese & Japanese, and all stops are also read out in these 4 languages. Only gripe is that you have to walk quite a long distances in order to transfer to other lines, and sometimes up and down many stairs. "
"Clean, quick, efficient","I was apprehensive about getting to a location because it involved a change of lines. I didn't need to worry. The signage was in both Korean and English and it was easy to figure out. There was some walking to transfer lines, but that is expected no matter where you go. The stations seem to be air-conditioned and have underground shopping malls. I never waited longer than 5-7 minutes for a train. "
Nice transportation network,"Nice transportation network to travel around Seoul, but many of the stations access to the street, if not all of them, don´t have escalators to the street level, which can be a bit annoying if you are traveling with big luggage."
Easy Access,"Seoul Metro was really easy to use. All signs were in both Korean and English so it was a breeze to navigate. The stations were really convenient with stores and restaurants underground. However, would recommend avoiding high traffic times if you are not used to big crowds and appreciate your personal space because the cars get pretty full. "
Busy and get a local to help,"Metro is crucial to getting around town and avoiding traffic. But make sure you have a local friend to help you get the pass, and to know how to get around!"
Seoul city travel,"If you understand how Tokyo bus systems work, they are very much alike. Biggest difference is there are less English Translations. You should really research where you are going ahead of time to prevent too much confusion. "
One of the world's greatest subway systems,"What a humane travel experience! The system has 11+ lines covering the city and suburbs. It is air conditioned, including some of the waiting areas. Cars are spacious and some have flat screen entertainment en route. The system does take a bit of getting accustomed to. Trains are long and a station may have a dozen exits/entrances. The traveler needs to know which exit is most convenient at the destination. Toilets are in most of the stations and are free and clean. I always paid 1,350 or 1,450 Korean won. That's $1.20 to $1.28 per ride (plus a 500 won returnable fare card). A bargain by any standard. "
Easy to navigate,"The Seoul Metro system is very inexpensive, easy to navigate and clean. Signs are in Korean and English."
love,"Seoul has the single nicest commuting system I have ever experienced. So well organized, easy to navigate, enabling travellers to see all the wonders of Korea."
Great system!,"The metro really covers the city well, is quite affordable and there are just enough announcements and signage in English to allow a non-Korean English speaker to navigate the system. Trains are clean and frequent. The only downside was that the system shuts down really early, like at midnight or something like that. So if you're out late, you may have to take a cab. "
best subway system i've ever used,"i'll keep this short...reliable, easy to use (even speaking/reading/understanding no Korean), SPOTLESSLY CLEAN (trains and stations), even during rush hour - not too crammed, well air conditioned trains during the hottest summer months."
Amazing if you are used to London Tube,"Easy to use, clean, and cheap. Staff are helpful. English signs which make it easy to work out where you are going."
Do not hesitate: take it,"Seoul is a very big city. Attractions are far away one from another. So, pay a Metro Card and take the Metro: efficient, clean, not expensive. What else? Do not hesitate: just have a look to the plan and walk to it. In summer it has AC: a real heaven after walking."
"Very Efficient, Best Way to get around","Very easy to navigate. Cheap way to get around Seoul. For tourist, I recommend to buy yourself a T Money Pass. You can use for all subways, buses and even taxis. Reloading more money to your card is very convenient and simple. They are color coordinated makes it easier to transfer to a different lines. There are signs in Korean and English, as well as the next stop announcement and makes getting around easier. Very clean and always on time. "
So easy to use,The train system is so easy to use!!At first it looks a little confusing because there is limited english but most places you want to go tell you the exact line and colour you need to be on as well as the exit you need to use. Makes the australian train system look terrible
Messed up with the routes...,The routes are really complicated and you have to walk a long way to change to another line... I would prefer to take taxi instead if you are not going too far...
Efficient,South Korea has one of the most efficient railway systems on this side of the world--from intercity and provincial travel to urban transportation.
The best way to travel in downtown Seoul !!!,"Feel free to use it as it's cheap, clean, comfortable and very easy to use !And no problem at all if you don't speak Korean...."
User friendly,"We went all over Seoul using the Metro. It is color coordinated, there are signs and maps in English. Most important thing to remember is to figure out which exit out of the station is closest to where you want to be. There are ""neighborhood maps"" in each station with places of interest marked. Also, there is a rabbit warren of shops in the larger stations with food and goods."
Easy to use,"Although it looks complicated, it is quite simple to use. There are free WiFi available and stations are very clean and easy to navigate."
Efficient and clean,"Seoul Metro is very convenient, efficient and clean. Use of T Money card to pay for fare (or taxi and some convenience stores) is a breeze to refill or get refund at the end of the trip. Stations have AC and trains are clean and comfortable."
Convenient and Easy to Use,"While residing in Seoul, South Korea at the Oakwood Premier Hotel for seven months, I used the subway system for all my commuting to and from work, shopping, running errands, everything!I found the subway to be very accessible but you can expect delays if you require the use of an elevator. Also, depending on where you are going, you can experience long walks making your way from one line to another at the transfer points. Also, during peak commuting periods, you can expect a lot of company and may have to wait for the next train and don't count on getting a place to sit right away!Most of the time the subway cars were well air conditioned but there were some occasions when the air conditioning was not adequate. Most of the time for me the experience was pleasant enough; you tend to get used to having a lot of people going along for the ride.I found that figuring out how to get from point A to point B was easy enough; the maps posted in the subway stations and in the trains were easy to understand even if you don't know the language. There is enough English translation and announcements to know when and where to get off. And the Seoul subway app is a good resource.The subway combined with the bus and train network enable the adventuresome to go pretty much anywhere! Be advised though that figuring out the bus system is not as easy. There is an app but it is in Korean and you may need to search on-line for an English tutorial to figure it out. Jim Tatum"
Easy and safe,"Seoul metro is easy to use and very safe. It is opened till midnight. For tourist, I recommend to get M Pass card which can offer you up to 20 rides per day. It is very easy and you don't have to waste you time to pay for a ride. "
Easy and fast,The most clean and fast metro systems.Connection is easy and fast. Traveling Seoul city is convenient. Good air conditioning system in Metro. Lot of the subway stations also connected with the underground shopping centers. 
Pleasant experiece,"The metro system is very easy to follow that make getting around Seoul very easy. Just get the T-Money Card that you can top up anytime. Most stations has many exits that you must know which exit to take to reach your place of interest. But fret not, the's so many signage that you can hardly miss. The train get very crowded during peak hour, so just avoid these hours."
"Easy, quick and the best way to get around","Seoul's metro is great! Easy to understand and navigate. Fast and affordable. Everything is Bi-lingual (Korean, English and another language I didn't understand) so you'll be able to figure it out pretty quickly."
Easy to Use and Goes to All Necessary Locations,Similar to most Asian subway systems. Clean and efficient. Low cost and can purchase tickets using kiosk in English. Interesting decor in many stations.
Excellent metro system - can get a bit crowdy but still good,"I believe this is the 2nd best metro system after Tokyo. The metro comes on time and is normally airconditioned in the summer. If you face any problems, the staff are ready to help you. This is great for foreign travelers. The metro goes all the way to the airport as well. You can get around anywhere in Seoul with the metro. It is also clean, quiet, no eating, and wonderful. "
"Efficient, affordable, clean, and timely","My husband and I had a 19-hour layover in Seoul so we decided to take a quick tour around Seoul before our connecting flight. There wasn't much waiting in between stops even though it was 10pm at night. (We have to live with the Washington DC metro system that will make you wait for 30 mins during rush hour and you better hope the track doesn't catch on fire!) During the winter, all the seats are heated and you can use free wifi on board. Refill machines are easy to use with English option, but most of them take cash only so make sure you have some cash handy. I would certainly recommend getting a T-money card for easy transport and quick refill, besides they have really cute designs. It saves you some money for not buying single tickets for every trip. These cards can be bought at any convenient store like 7-Eleven, GS25, and CU."
Easy,"Very easy to navigate your way round ,frequent,on time clean ,I couldn't believe how cheap too ,purchase a card usually from minimarkets,top up saves you time ,works like an oyster card you scan card before and after journey to check your amount left on card ,great way to see Seoul Korea very inexpensive brilliant."
Easy travels ,"It's easy with the metro stations. Machines with English language options available so it's easy to select your destinations and amounts to pay for trip. Seoul station also has ktx trains to Busan and again, there's information and help available in case one needs it."
"Extremely efficient, clean, useful! Congratulations, Koreans!","Since they have stations inside Seoul's airports (Gimpo and Incheon), I truly recommend you buying a T-Money card. There are machines to sell them next to the machines where you transfer money to these cards. They have instructions in english, so dont me afraid of.The card comes with a metro map but I recommend you to use mobile apps in order to get right directions (it took a few trips in order to understand the directions of the main lines).This T-money cards also can be used in bus, so you can easily travel around Seoul without any problem.Moreover, all Koreans and people from Seoul are very polite and well educated. I saw a scene that will mark me forever: due to the summer temperature in Seoul, a woman got ill. A medical team arrived - without shouting or making noise - and properly cared the woman. All the people around them was calm and assisted the medical team to reach the woman.So, feel comfortable to use Seoul metro!"
Good Ride,Center of Seoul Metro is the most efficient way to get around the city. Price is very good and it runs often enough that one don't have to wait long. I feel safe enough to ride even though I'm not Korean. Locals are helpful in case you are lost and have to ask for directions. Definitely will ride again the next time I visit Seoul.
"Clean, cheap and easy to use.","I have used the metro in Seoul a few times. It has good coverage of the city, is very clean and easy to use and is also very cheap. Of course it pays to study it a little bit before you use it for the first time, and to download a picture of the metro system to your phone so you can figure easily where to go or change lines. But this is all very easy to do and in the metro all info is in English as well as in Korean."
Best public transport system I have come across,"Seoul metro system is huge with many lines. Get a map of these and be careful with the colours - some lines are coloured very similarly. Double check where the line starts and ends, it isn't always in a straight line then jump on in. We used the metro extensively for our 4 day visit. We found it easy to use, clean, on time, frequent and felt very safe on it. At times it can be very busy and the numerous exits at stations can be confusing. We always found someone happy to assist if we got lost. Don't bother with taxi's just take the metro, it is quick and you won't get stuck in that awful traffic. and strongly suggest you download the metro app, the colours are much easier to see on your phone and you can zoom in to trace the lines."
Perfect to explore the city,A trip will be around 1300 WKR. Be aware that always a deposit will be taken from you so do not throw the ticket and take your money back at the end of your sejour - aprox 500 WKR / ticket/ pers.Well explained in English so no problem for foreigners.Maps are clear and coverage very wide.Enjoy
Easy to use,"We used the metro after we had been awake for 24+ hours getting to Seoul ! Easy to use as the ticket machines have language choices, English being one of them. You pick your journey, buy your ticket, which includes a deposit, which is refunded once you get to your destination . It's one big continuous carriage and very clean compared to what we have back home! Easy to navigate and run every few minutes. Great way to get around!"
efficent and fast,"not alot of english spoken if you have a good sense of direction,you will find it easy and quick way to get around seoul,ince you get the hang of it"
Extremely Efficient,"I was very intimidated at the thought of traveling around Seoul alone, so I figured I would stick to taxis. Not necessary. The Seoul Metro system is extremely easy for foreigners to use. It is a color coded system with English words at most, if not all stations. It is also very clean. The only downside is it can become very crowded. There are also many apps you can choose from to help you map out your route ahead of time."
"Clean, fast & efficient",Its so amazing that almost everywhere in seoul is interconnected with their MRT! Its very clean and also at some stations they have friendly guides that can help with directions. Amazed how even old people really make use of the stairs. People here are so health conscious that they encourage the use of stairs rather than use the escalators. 
Clean,I'm from New York. Needless to say the Seoul metro is like a 5 star luxury hotel compared to a no star hotel. It is amazing how clean the metro is. Not complicated at all. Just make sure you have enough money on your card because depending on where you get off you'll need to pay extra when leaving the station. You swipe your card when entering and leaving the metro.
Best way of going around seoul,"We were at first daunted by the number of lines, the number of interchanges and all the Korean names. But once you get the hang of it, it is very easy to get around. First, check out the map which station you are departing from. Then look for the station you are going to. For example, from Myeongdong you want to go to Bukchon Hanbok Village which is exit at Anguk station. You can see the shortest route is to change at Chungmuro interchange and take line 3 (orange) up 3 stations to Anguk. At Myeongdong station, look for arrow directions to Chungmoro,then after getting off train at Chungmoro, look for direction sign for line 3. There are different platforms for different lines. Then line 3 goes either direction. Look for the name of the NEXT STATION i.e. towards Eujiro 3 and NOT towards Dongguk Univ. Then you'll be in the right direction. The train comes at a rather short interval and cabins are clean and have English signage. To alight, they'll flash names of next station and they appears in English too. The only set back are the stairs. Be prepared to walk and climb stairs. Not convenient if you are carrying heavy suitcases.Better to get yourself a T-money card from the airport of any convenient stores. Easy to top up too. AND, do google or find out which is the exit nearest to your destination, because you might find yourself walking unnecessary and having to back track after you've got out of station."
Easy to Navigate ,"I used the metro on my recent 4 day stay and once you navigate the system it really is a good affordable way to get around Seoul. The trains are modern and air-conditioned and the entire metro network is like a city below ground with shops, markets etc etc. "
eficcient,"Easy to use, inexpensive way to get around in Seoul. There are english singns and even announcements in englsih. Bring cash to pay for the tickets!"
"Goes everywhere, clean and thoroughly signposted",Get a T-Money card and take the subway wherever you want to go! Lots of maps and directional signs to help you find your stop and how to get to your destination.
World-Class!,"New in town, but have been all over the world and SEOUL subway system is among the best! Clean, safe and relatively easy once you figure out the basics (like you need Won to buy their metro/T-money card). Will definitely become a regular and use it when driving/parking is not optimal."
Excellent service ,"Really excellent service. Unbelievably safe and reasonably priced. On time services, with extensive network. All information in Korean, English and chinese. "
Reliable Service,"Overall I felt that Seoul Metro is really reliable and punctual. The system is easy to comprehend and very user friendly even for foreigners. Just that the walking from point to point can be quite a bit, and there is a lot of stairs."
"Handy system, very clear, a vast network","After being in Beijing, I thought I couldn't get any better. But it can!These subway trains are very wide, so there is a lot of space. The signs are very clear. And the people are friendly and don't push when the need to get out/in. Great first impression of the city when we arrived from the airport!"
Free T Money Card at Korea Tourism (Malaysia),"If you're in malaysia, make sure to visit korea tourism in hap seng tower in KL.Bring along your flight itinerary and do a survey on their korea tourism website.And then they'll give you free T Money Card with 2000 won inside, a lot of other useful vouchers and a book about Muslim friendly restaurants in Korea.You can visit their website for more details.Hope this helps."
Very convenient to travel around. But a little pricey,I enjoyed using the metro as it moves fast and the train arrives punctually. I used the metro to travel around and it was super convenient. I don't like to pay 1250 Won per ride which I consider rather pricey since I pay an average of $0.77 in my country Singapore for a short ride.
Convenient and quick transportation ,"Had been to Seoul for over 4 times , I had to say it would be one of the mass transit which have most city coverage. Using T-money card enable easy travel and over the past few years. All too up machine have multiple language ready for tourist from around the world . only thing need to careful is to ensure change the right line and direction when switch train."
Efficient and fast,"This is by far the best way to get around Seoul. It's cheap and connects to most areas of interest. You need to buy a card in one of the stations, and then charge it with money - as English speaking tourists this was initially daunting, but there was no shortage of offers from residents to help us sort it out.Once you've got the hang of the system, you'll never ever again want to get a cab in Seoul's crowded streets.Main tip: avoid travelling in the peak hours if you can. It does get pretty crowded."
Easy way to get around Seoul,"The metro was our primary form of transportation around Seoul. Clean stations and frequent trains. T-money cards were very convenient to use (sold at most convenience stores; we got the basic ones for 2,500 won each). The metro is probably not the best option for people with mobility issues as most stations had many stairs or long walks when you're changing train lines at transfer points."
Best metro ever,"Never got lost inside or took a wrong wagon since my arrival in Seoul, everything is so well explained and written in different languages, takes you throughout Seoul and beyond. Metro comes fast and is comfortable. "
Excellent ,"Excellent public transport system. We spent 10 days going around Seoul using only their metro system. You first have to buy a Y-money card (transit card, the equivalent of the Melbourne mykey card, English Oyster card, Hong Kong Octopus card). It costs 5000 won. We initially put 10000 won on each card. We refilled our cards 2 twice with top ups of 10000 won each time. I reckon it's good value compared to many other international cities like Paris for example. There are clear maps in every stations. Also, both in the stations & trains, all announcements are done in Korean and English. While travelling, when approaching each station, the announcements are done in English & Korean + they also tell you which side to go exit. Very good user friendly system. Very clean. Very punctual & fast. No long waiting periods. "
Easy to maneuver,"Easy to understand and reaches many different areas of the city. We rarely had to walk far to find the metro. It is convenient and timely. The only issue I had was figuring out what direction the trains were going, once we were in the station. But, once you have that down, it was easy breezy."
Efficient and clean,I love their metro as compare to what we have here in AU. They have dedicated platform. It is clean and so is the train itself. 
Good Public Transit,"We mostly used the metro to get around, and it was pretty simple and quick. We took advantage of the bus system too (while Google maps doesn't work for routing in the Korea, it still works great for public transit, especially the bus). We visited during October, and they were doing a huge push for tourism. In one of the shopping districts, there was a booth set up and they were handing out goodie bags and free metro cards (I think normally you have to pay a deposit to get the card in the first place). So if you're going during the October Festa like we did, maybe see if they're offering the same thing again."
Great Metro,There are lots of lines that can take you wherever you need to go. It is a very modern system and is on time.
"Fast, cheap and efficient",Great system. It is cheap and efficient. The most bizarre thing is the gas mask cabinets that are all over the place.
Easy and fast ,"Easy to understand how to get to the destination,but in July Seoul is quite hot and they didn't provide air conditioners so it was a bit too hot for children but the staffs was so friendly,and the seat is comfortable."
Best in town to move,Very useful ! Get your metro card and load it with enough money for your trips. In rush hours it can be overloaded with people but it's the best transport if you travel with less than 2 people in the city of Seoul. 
very user friendly,"Even if you are not familiar with the alphabet, you would easily see the whole city by taking the subway. They do skip sometimes, but they have announcements (in writing and voice) also in English both at the tracks and in the train. If you could spot yuor next station, you can choose your direction (at the tracks). T-money card is advised, very easy to buy and upload."
Easy access but Lots of steps,"Using Korea Railway service, we can easy to get to different places. However, there are lots of steps, stairs and long long way walking for transfer. A little tired after few days continuous walking. "
Easy to navigate ,"Not all stations have easy access to escalators or lifts. Most are stairs and some stations use turnstile at entrance, in cases where you have a big luggage, its harder to use the stations. "
Orderly,"I love metros, and Seoul has a great one. You can get just about anywhere, and because the car traffic is so bad, you can save a lot of time. Like everything in the city though, it is crowded, and it is not particularly disabled friendly. It's simple to use: either a pass or a one trip ticket are easy to buy and the ticket machines are in English. Like other Asian cities, Seoul residents line up on either side of the train doors to allow the out coming passengers to exit: a brilliant idea that should be adopted universally. I think that Koreans are more polite than other world citizens as they stand and politely wait for the passengers to leave."
Easily up there with the best,"Impressively comprehensive coverage of the city, and certainly goes almost everywhere most tourists will want to go, really cheap, stations and trains superbly signposted with clear info everywhere, and super frequent trains. Brilliant. Without giving it deep thought, would be tempted to say best I've seen. I thought Taipei was the best I'd seen, but I think I'd have to say Seoul is just a bit better."
Very efficient,Best way to travel to visit places of interests in Seoul.The map is very clear - different colours for each subway lines and station has numbers.There transfer signs between stations are clear marked.There are plenty of toilet in the station precinct - free and clean.It there are 4 of you - taxi for short distances may be cheaper and the metro.
"Clean, safe, well organized","I've been on many metro lines and would rate Seoul near the top. Easy to navigate, clean and safe (even for a solo female traveler.) can get crowded during rush hours. A useful tip is that each station has a sign that shows 3 locations: the previous station, current station (in bold type) and the station the train will be going to next....very helpful to make sure you are traveling in the correct direction.You can get around the city as fast, if not faster, by metro versus car....Seoul street traffic is a nightmare."
Great system ,Many cities have great Metros. Seoul is no exception. It is a slick system and inexpensive to use. Ideally get the app for your phone as it makes journey planning much easier especially for the non Korean speakers.
Efficient!!,"Just like the Japan metro, this transport is just as efficient and should I say confusing sometimes. So download the Korea Subway App that can be used even offline for you to navigate the train system in Seoul. What I like most is this takes you to the Inchon Airport. "
Very fast and efficient ,"The Seoul metro is fast and efficient, but there are so many different lines. It is clean and the maps also have the English names. The staff are quite helpful and it's easy to get basically anywhere in Seoul. If you buy a Single Journey Destination ticket, you can get a 500 won refund when you get to your destination, because it's a deposit included in your fare. Just find a deposit booth and you get your 500 won, it's good if you are low on money. "
Probably the best subway system in the world,"I've used subway systems in the US, Europe, and Asia, and Seoul Metro is, in my opinion, the best one in the world. It's unbelievably clean, on time, and affordable. Compare it to the one in Tokyo, for instance, and it's day and night. Never once did I feel unsafe riding it. In some other cities, the subway system seems like a gathering place for the criminal element of society. Here, everybody is polite (with the exception of some elderly people who will push you out of the way without blinking...) and minds their own business. I never witnessed anybody talking loudly or being obnoxious. Not a piece of trash on the floor. This is more an indication of the quality of the Korean people rather than the metro system itself, but still. A civilized society and the level of infrastructure usually go hand in hand."
Metro,The metros were clean.The metros had a nice cold temperature in the heat of the summer. The stations were also very clean. There is a lack of maps in the stations. Otherwise it was easy to get around in.1300 for ticket and 500 for deposit.
Fast,The metro is fast and easy to use. We didn't know that the pink chairs are meant for expecting mothers and the chairs near the doors are for elderly people. It's better to sit in the middle of a row or just stand. The metro has English to help!! 
On time,"Efficient, modern, prompt, and exceptionally clean. However, sometimes you must make very long treks up and down stairs and escalators for transfers. "
Nice and efficient metro rail,At first you will be confused by all of the mazed and direction but thats normal. You will get accustomed by it. Dont forget to download metro rail apps.
Excellent mode of transport ,"The Seoul Metro is clean, affordable, convenient, and generally easy to use. Single fare tickets can be acquired or, if you plan to use more frequently, a Metro card can be purchased and recharged. You can recharge at the metro stations or at any variety of convenience stores throughout the city. An additional plus is the fact that most stations have bathrooms that are serviced and therefore are rather clean. Not all stations,, however, are set up to accommodate individuals with disabilities. "
convenient and cool subway,"By using a subway, people can go wherever you want... it is most convenient and reliable transportation in metro seoul area. Also, in summer you can avoid the heat in a subway."
Brilliant Metro,I loved the metro in Seoul. It was easy to navigate. There is an app available which also helped to plan a trip.
Easy to Navigate,We didn't have any difficulty navigating through the various stops. We bought one of those 3-day tourist passes that guaranteed easy zip in and out of the stations!
Just Traveling,"The Seoul metro is an extremely efficient and economical way to get around Seoul. It's clean, timely, and easily accessible."
Best way to get around Seoul,Seoul metro was the main form of transportation used to get around the city. Most convenient stores can recharge the top up card. Each trip charges approximately AUD$1-$2 depending on distance so preplan your trip for the day. Some places may be within walking distance of each other. Also some stations are quite deep underground and even from the entrance may take a short stroll to get to. 
Great way to get around ,I come from a country that has almost no subways so getting on and off these is a bit of a mystery. But I downloaded the Seoul metro app and getting around with it was easy as. Cheap and gets you to the main spots around this great city. 
Easy to Use,"Convenient and really easy to use, especially when you get the app that gives you the full map and tell you rates. "
"easy, fast",The trains arrive on time. They are clean. They can be crowded at peak times which is to be expected. I used to get around the city and also to take to the airport. There are elevators for the elderly or disabled. Clean bathrooms inside station.
Cheap and fast,"This is the cheapest and fastest way of getting around Seoul. With the extensive network you can get anywhere in Seoul. Purchase the ticket at the ticket machine at the station. Very easy to use, follow the map and the correct line and destination with English subtitles."
Great way to get around while in Seoul,"The metro is fast and convenient. However, this is a heads up for travelers. When we rode the metro we purchased one-way tickets to our destinations. For every ticket you purchase you will notice an extra 500 KRW charge for each ticket purchased. This is a deposit for the ticket. When you reach your destination you will see a refund kiosk once you exit your final destination gate. You put the used ticket in and you will get 500 KRW. I guess this is South Korea's way of recycling. We would have never known this if it weren't for some nice Korean metro worker who saw us exit and motioned us to the kiosk. We had no idea what she was saying as we don't speak Korean. She pointed to the ticket and showed us the slot to put it in for the refund. On other metro trips I actually heard the metro gate say in English ""refund"" through the speaker, as I scanned the ticket to exit the destination gate. We made it a point to tell other Americans that we saw on the metro about the refund. One soldier who is stationed in South Korea thanked us, because he had no idea. He said he had been carrying around used tickets since February. "
Very efficiebt,It's easy getting around Seoul using the subway. It's very convenient to use the T pass to pay for your rides and it's easy to reload and refund in stations or convenience stores
Buy a T Card and explore the city,$10000 KRW plus $3000 for the card got us around the city for two full days. They announce stops in English and it's extremely easy to use. If you need help there is always someone at the pay gates to point you to the right or left side if you get confused. It can't be beat
The best way to get around Seoul,"It's fast and inexpensive way to discover Seoul. Once you figure out how to navigate and understand the metro system, it is quite easy even for a person who can't speak Korean.Download the metro app and you can see the various stops and also give you the transfer options and the approximate travel time to your destination. The tricky part is knowing the direction of the train heading towards your destination. So for example, if you are heading to Point Z, you will not find the directions in the subway telling you that you are heading to Point Z. Rather, look at your app and then figure out the next stop from where you currently are that is going towards Point Z. I know it sounds confusing but once you are inside the metro it will all make sense.The metro is very clean, quiet and I felt very safe taking the subway. Felt much more safe than taking the El in Chicago or the subway in New York. Majority of the trains will announce in several languages including English what the next step will be.You can purchase your ticket at the station. A trip depending on your destination can cost you as little as 1200 won or something like a $1..08 depending on the exchange rate. If you are buying a single trip the machine is going to automatically charge your for a deposit of like 500 won or 45 cents. But once you get to your destination or your way back, the station will have a machine that will give you a cash refund on the deposit. I did not know this until toward the end of my visit so I ended up accumulating tickets with deposit refunds.Don't sit on the pink colored seats in the Metro. These are designated for the elderly and pregnant women.The Metro does involve a lot of walking once inside the subway system so wear comfortable shoes. There are stairs and also escalators. Note: It is common practice in any escalator in S. Korea - stand left if you want to take the escalator all the way up. The right side is for folks who want to walk up the escalator."
Very cheap & easy to use,"The metro system across Seoul is very large and comprehensive, yet it's still easy to use, even for foreigners with no Korean language skills at all. There are metro maps located throughout the stations, and signs everywhere pointing you in the required direction. There are certain seats reserved for the elderly or pregnant ladies, and it can get busy at periods (as with all public transport). Once you purchase a T-money card, you can just tap in and out instead of having to buy individual tickets, much cheaper & easier. Also there are loads of shops, even full markets (especially at Gangnam station) in the metro, most shops are cheaper than those above ground, well worth stopping at on your journeys. While travelling in Seoul I'd definitely recommend getting the metro instead of taxis, works out cheaper, faster and you get a taste of local life. "
BEST way to visit Seoul,"When you arrive, buy a T-money card. Charge-it and you travel like local :)All distances is not soo close. Verify if you can take the last metro and connections.No service during night. (apprx. between 00.00 to 05.30)"
"Convenient, fast and reasonable",Download the subway map and take the metro. It is fast clean and safe. Buy a T-card to travel around with no hassle
Easy to use,"Follow the colours!Buy a T Card. If you are going to Busan and have kids, make sure your kids ticket is also a t card. We made that mistake.Easy system to use. Much like London, Paris and Tokyo."
"It is clean, comfortable and convenient.","Korea's subway is cheap and convenient. It may be complicated because of the wide variety of routes, but it is very convenient because you can travel most of Seoul and Gyeonggi by subway. Unless rush hour, you can usually afford it. It is clean and pleasant."
THe best way to go around seoul,"THe best way to go around seoul.Download application. It does the job for you. Routes , Wich side to board , and what exit to take when of, Wich is the best thing about it since it's another Seoul underground."
"Easy to get aound, very clear maps","The metro was easy to navigate, even as a non Korean speaker. They are the best way to get around Seoul"
Very efficient,"I travel to Seoul often and the metro is very efficient, clean and safe. Transit card makes it even better to quickly navigate through it. Great shopping and dining also inside the many stations."
"good and bad, but definitely useful.","We use it each and every time we visit Seoul. The metro is easy to use once you get the hang of it. Expect crowds at most hours. Unless 20-30 years ago, there are free restrooms in most stops...still remember having to pay for use back when. "
The easies way for travelling in Seoul,First time I saw map of MRT I was confused. But ticket machine was in english and pretty streight forward. I was advised to buy T-Money card what was pretty challenging for me because local people do not speak English very much so it took me long time to be able to bought this card. Benefit of this card is that you do not specify target destination when you buy your ticket. You get more freedom. It also looks like this T-Money card for accepted by taxi drivers. So after one day I got pretty familiar with metro in Seol. It is pretty fast and cheap. Next time I am in Seaol I will use metro of course :)
Print your booking ticket with PAPER,"Make sure you must print your Korail pass reservation. Even though you had your booking number, it would be useless. No Paper, No ticket! Worst experience ever!Print! Print! Print! Don't even expect to get a help from information desk. They are not helpful either."
Great way to get around Seoul,"This metro system is so interconnected and efficient that you can get anywhere around Seoul fast and easy. Stations are well-lit and not scary at all, even in the late hours. Cars were cold and clean ( as is the norm in So Korea). There werer signs leading you to what exits you need to take so getting around was not a problem. We used the Korea Tour Card ( a transport card similar to the T-Money Card available only for tourists) to pay for our fare. No cash involved. Only drawback is that there were some stations that didn't have escalators going up- which was a bit of a hassle for elder people."
Simple and efficient,"We just used it a couple of times, to travel between Seoul central station and the Gangnam area and found it to be clean, fast, reasonably priced and well organised. It was a pleasure to use."
One of the Best Metro Systems in Asia,"We been on the Metro/Subway systems in Singapore, Hong Kong, Tokyo, Kyoto, KL, Bangkok and many other Asian cities and Seoul is one of our favorites. So many lines, so many stops, clean, cheap and easy to use for a non-Korean speaker. "
One of the best rail systems,The metro is really efficient and easy to use. It connects well across the city and is very cost effective with a T Money card. As with all asian train networks it is pretty packed most of the time but trains run regularly and on time.
Very clean and fast ,There are subways every 2 minutes. It is so fast and clean. Only CON is it is too cold with air conditioning in summer. 
"Well connected in whole sity, clean and not so expensive","Seoul Metro is well designed and built, easily to access from everywhere in Seoul, the train was clean and well maintain, each station also sell good stuffs and snacks, I like it :)"
Hard and inconvenient ,Waste waste of timeMost local Koreans can't speak English so they can't lead you well even if they wanted to help you I wasted 3 hours of my time round and round in the metroIt's better to take a taxi if you are a tourist like me or a tour bus than wasting your whole day at the metro They have so much lines and complicated routes Not recommended if you have an infant or toddler most specially 
Seoul subway is clean and easy to ride.,"Compared to Tokyo, London, Paris, and NYC subways i think Seoul subway system is the cleanest, easy to navigate, safe and cheap! Do not hesitate to try it!"
Easy to navigate and cheap,"Get a T-money card and go. Easy to navigate and get around plus wonderful value for money.You can also use the T-money cards to buy things in convenience store, some fast food restaurants, buses and taxis. "
Cheap but busy,"If you don't know public transit is the most commonly used form of travel in Korea. Most of the time it isn't to bad, but get on during rush hour and expect crowds. Line 2 (green line) is the most busiest line, so if you want to not be right in the middle head for the back or very front cars. "
Great metro system,Good metro system for tourist. Easy to find your own ways from airport to other place. Even for first time travelers as long as you have a good internet connection then it will work well
Comfortable. Reliable. Cheap,"I tried the Seoul Metro in June 2017. The route taken was Samseong Station to Myeong Dong/Dongdaemun Market. We were a bit hesitant at first whether going on the Seoul Metro or other transport/taxi. But our friend convinced us to take the Metro. We went down to Samseong Station, catching the Line 2/Green then transfer to Line 4/Blue. Tickets are avaliable just before the entrance to concourse. We were very surprised that there was an officer, an old man, who speaks English and helped us on the ticketing process. First we must buy the TMobile card for 3000KRW and then ""recharge"" the card for the fare. Desirable amounts for recharge is available from 2000KRW. To enter the concourse, just simply swipe the card at the gate. The Metro schedule is very flexible, it arrives and departs in every 5 to 10 minutes. The Metro was very clean and comfortable, in busy hours, just expect it will be full so standing up is just the option throughout your journey. The lines are connected to each other. Just look at the map, which is free in every station, then you are good to go to every station, take attention for the station you passed and where you can transfer between lines. The Metro is reliable, fast, and cheap."
Less complicated than Tokyo Subway,"Easy to use and convenient if travelling in city. Connects to all attractions and sights. Both english and korean instructions. Train map on train is meant for 18yr olds with perfect eyesight. Announcements on train in Korean, English and sometimes Chinese."
"Quick, affordable, ubiquitous","Seoul's metro works really well. Purchase a T-money card from a machine in any metro station (English language menus are available) and recharge the card as needed. Each metro station has maps showing all the entrances (be sure to note the map's orientation) and all of the stations we visited had handicapped accessible chair lifts on at least one of the entries, and often elevators as well. Most stations have several food vendors and a convenience store. There are vending machines on many of the platforms. Platforms have emergency equipment and doors/walls to prevent unauthorized track access. Trains run on time and their arrival is indicated on monitors. Clean toilets in stations."
Clean,"Dependable and clean, works. There seem to be some accessibility issues, I've found a number of situations where stairs seem the only option."
Best Metro I have ever used.,"I have taken the Metro in many places: New York, Chicago,Washington,London, Paris, Santiago, Moscow, Budapest. The Seoul Metro is hands down the best, cleanest, most modern that I have ever used."
Seoul Metro,"Super easy, takes your everywhere in the city you want to go. Signs in English and you can do the ticket purchase in English. If you are going to use it a lot get a pass and top up as needed."
"Safe, fast and easy","The Seoul metro is clean, fast and safe. Highly recommend to get around the city. Everybody is quite respectful and quiet during their rides."
Very easy ,"Once you purchase the Tmoney card, and put some money on. Walk on the right hand side , take your time to read directions. Most times you will get to your destination."
Download the app and get a tmoney card on arrival,The app for the Seoul metro is great. Particularly the route/fare calculators and the maps of the metro stations showing you which exit to take (alot of stations have 10+ exits and the wrong one may result in a return to the station to walk to the correct one if it's across a street).
Excellent Transportation ,This system will take you anywhere you want to go in Seoul. It's very clean and efficient. I felt very safe on the metro everywhere I went. Signage was clear. 
Very comfortable,"In Seoul, almost every citizen use Seoul metro because it's very cost-efficient. It helps us keep our appointment and other schedules. Moreover, it is so comfortable for the foreigners to bring them to every hot spots in Seoul."
"Wide network and punctual - similar to Tokyo, Osaka and London","Easy to move around using the subway. Payment via T-money card (similar to Octopus card in HK and Touch and Go card in Malaysia). Basic min.fixed fee is Won1,250 per trip. It will deduct immediately upon tapping the card at the gate when entering the station. If journey to outskirts, it will deduct more upon exit. "
Easy system,"The system is easy. If you buy a single ticket, you get charged a deposit of 500won. You will get your deposit back, when you insert the card in the deposit machines. These you will find at every exit."
Complicated transfer,"Travel using the metro in Seoul can take some getting used to. You will need to look at the lines that are available at all stations. The city has many elderly, so the train has several seats at the end of the train specially catered for the elderly. At the end also, cyclists with their bicycles can also park their vehicles.The stations also have many stations with staircases, some have escalators - it can be tiring to transfer from line to line in Seoul"
It's awesome,Wow! It's easy and comfortable and even cheaper!you will be so inspired when you check the map of Metro:)
Smooth Operator,There were English sign boards conveniently located so that one did not have any trouble any boarding --exiting etc 
Very complicated,"you should be smart enough to catch the entrances because there was no clear indications nearby. Besides, the only language was Korean other than the front page of the ticket selling system. "
Metro and Train Travel,Subway Stops in JW Marriott Hotel and is very easy to buy tickets on and Ride. We also rode the Korean Bullet Train SRT from Seoul to The New Korean Independence Memorial about 40 minutes south of Seoul. 266Km/hr and rode the ktx back to Seoul a nd Yongsan Station. Very beautiful memorial and slick trip.
super metro service,"cheap, quick, clean, easy to change and follow signs, polite staff and fellow passengers etc., very good way to get around"
Clean safe and extensive ,"Very easy to navigate your own way around. There are maps, signs and announcements in English everywhere. Roughly W1400 a ride and a refundable card fee at the end of your journey or at any station. Thanks for the vote if you found this review helpful."
Easy to get around with.,"I personally find the Seoul Metro system easier to navigate than the Tokyo Metro and not as crowded. I find that the Seoul Metro has more English sings and more announcements in English as far as your upcoming stations. Also, the T money card is very easy to use just as the Japanese Suica card and I find it very convenient to use and get around with here in Seoul."
TMoney Mpass - Don't Leave Your Hotel Without It,"The Seoul Metro is very efficient. Upon arriving at the Seoul International Airport, buy your TMoney Mpass at Exits 5 and 10 at the ground floor. You can use it for the airport bus, subway and taxi. An initial load of KRW 20,000 is good enough to bring you around Seoul. Re-loading of your TMoney can be done in the numerous convenience stores and in the subway stations.For the subway, you can download the Rail Map Lite app for easier navigation around Seoul. The toilets are so clean in the subway."
Good transportation services,"Do download the app 'Subway' as this app shown all the different line for the subway- light blue, blue, green, orange, purple etc.Good to check out using the app and change lines if needed.App could be review without data or wifi. Easier to plan in advance."
Convenient and efficient...,"The Seoul Metro is the most convenient mode of transport to get you to all the tourist attractions within the city limits. The 9 lines are easily identified by the colour and number, and are integrated to each other at the many interchange stations. My only complaint is the lack of escalators in the underground stations, but on the bright side, this will augur well for your fitness level!"
Free gas masks !,Easy and painless to navigate. Not too expensive either. Free gas masks are all around at each station just in case the nutty north attack Make sure you get your refund after every trip by putting back your card into the refund machine.The metro station also double as air raid shelters just in case Kim throws a fit 
Clean and easy to use,"This must be one lf the cleanest subway in the world, if not the cleanest.Local names are translated in English, same for ticketing machines and it's easy for a foreigner to move around."
Metro!,- Seoul Metro is very accessible and easy to use.- Tickets are available from the machines (there is an english option)- Each station is announced before it gets to that station so you know when and where you get off. - Each station also have maps since the seoul metro have different lines (sometimes confusing but you can get a hang of it!)- depending on the time and where you're headed it can get pretty full. - Each station also usually have stores such as convenience stores and food stalls.
one of best and suitable way for transportation in Seoul,"Compared to other transportation facilities, Seoul metro is cheaper and has a wide area network. almost place in Seoul are accessible by metro. you must notice to some point if you want use metro:1- some station are confusing specially when it is location for two tree line2- fortunately there are good maps on wall of station that are useful for recognizing address and your location3- fortunately all of wagons and stations have English guide.4- in some station distance between exit way is long be careful for select correct direction"
A new experience,Busy time early in the morning and after 6!! Be mindful of reserved seats for elderly people!!! Have your map with you at all times. Know where you are going before getting on. It's a little bit complicated. Wheelchair access.
Great but confusing ,The seoul metro is very confusing especially for foreigners who don't know korean. You should first find a english simple map. For questions ask the information center. Should check map before entering train and which exit should you use. 
Easy access to metro,Easy access to metro which is connected to the mall in the hotel. We took it daily to get around and very inexpensive compared to taking taxi in the city.
"One of the best in the world, except...","This is a clean, safe, fast and inexpensive way to move around the capitol. One card will link to connecting buses and other Metro lines. The only complaint is long and complicated walks to change lines, perhaps due to the complex addition of lines over years. The walks nevertheless do not diminish the system's brilliant convenience. "
Fantastic Transportation in Seoul City,"Seoul Metro/ Subway is fantastic transport that take you around the city and surround.The most important is you need to know your destination as when you buy your ticket from automatic vender you need to key in your destination, number of passenger. You can choose English, Chinese, Japanese or Korean languages provided from the machine.If you travel around Seoul a single ticket cost 1370 won plus 500 won deposit for the card. After you arrive at your destination you can get your deposits refund from the refund machine which normally located next to the selling machine. Of course when you have any trouble with the machine, it has button for you to push to call the attendant to help you out. Have fun! "
comfort,"Well connected and comfortable and clean and easy way to make a tour in Seoulrather than other way, and this is really better than the metro in ohter cities"
Best Subways system ever ,Easy to use and very clean. The system connects most of Seoul and signs are available in multiple languages. 
Very convenient!,"It was puzzling to use the metro at first, since most of the people couldn't speak nor understand English. Nonetheless, Koreans will really try to help you even if they couldn't understand you. Good thing we also downloaded Korea Travel app. This was a good help. We purchased T-money card at 7-11. We used the T-money whenever we ride the subway, bus, and taxi."
Korean efficiency,"The most difficult part of using the subway is actually finding where the subway station is. No big signs like on the London Underground. Once in the station ticket machines have an option in English and if you have a problem or have to consult the map at least 2 Koreans will come to help and won't leave until they are satisfied that they've got you sorted out. Trains area clean, frequent and much more spacious than the Tube. It's quite easy to transfer between lines but more tricky to find the right exit. There are usually maps of the local area but the orientation changes frequently and it can get very confusing. Again, there is usually a helpful fellow traveller to point you in the right direction!"
Gateway to Seoul,Super simple to find your way around the Metro. Very convenient signage and payment by vending taking only KWon . Stops announced in Korean and English with interactive Leds indicating stops.
So easy to use,The Seoul Metro has to be one of the easiest to use and is also very clean and easy to understand even if you are not Korean or can not read Korean. Easy and cost effective. Many of the bigger stations have underground shopping and food so it is like another adventure if you have never been before
Don't travel during rush hours,"Trains are usually clean and frequent. However avoid traveling during rush hours, especially if you have young children with you as things are quite chaotic with people trying to push their way onto and off the train. Avoid line 2 at all cost during rush hours."
Convenient Public Transport,"The cost of metro is fairly cheap, which links with different regions by different lines. Next station will shows on TV display and by broadcast. It will be better for foreigner to identify the station you would like to go by its station numbering.Remember to get right direction of metro line when you access to the gate and down to the platform as most of platforms are in one way train, which means you can't change the line direction if you wrongly access."
Easy way to see Seoul,"The metro system is a great way to get around. Its easy, clean and seems to run very frequently. The network is vast and you need an idea of where you are going as trips often involve a line change. But there is an official app that plans routes for you. This is best done before you travel each day as wifi is required. At the station the machines have an english option. You need either the name or number of the destination and it does the rest. For a couple of days i did single trips that were 1 or 2 usd for up to 45 mins. There is a refund of the deposit on the tickets as you exit the station."
Good but confusing in parts,"It is incredibly cheap to use the metro system. I'm staying in Cheonan near the Dujong rail station. You can get a train to Seoul using the metro here because the metro, unbelievably for a UK resident, reaches out that far and beyond. A ticket from Dujong to the centre of Seoul is about 3000 Won. You'll pay that for an ice lolly or a can of beer.I had a look at the map, got on the train, waited for the stop I wanted, got off the train, but then could not find the platform to change lines. I exited through the barrier, and that's the end of your journey, even though you've paid to go much further. I had to buy another ticket. This happened half a dozen more times, I just could not find the directions to the platform I wanted at intersect stations.Also, I could not find a map that you could carry in your pocket, such is the reliance on smartphones and internet in South Korea. Just a question of knowing what you are doing I suppose. Trains are clean, prompt, rapid and reliable.Also, if you are in the East of the city, the best way of returning to Cheonan is on the SRT train that leaves Suseo station. The trains run in a tunnel 50 meters below the surface. 8 quid to travel 50 miles in 40 minutes in almost business class comfort. From East Seoul, the fastest way South."
Convenient way to travel in Seoul,"I bought a metro refillable electronic card at the hotel which was topped up for one journey. Though I know only English and it was my first visit to Seoul I found it quite easy to use the Metro. The tricky thing in a metro is to know which direction you are going or else you may end up going in opposite direction. Most stations had clear map of all stations on left side track and right side track making it easy to understand which track to take . Also each track also mentioned the next station on that side of track which was also helpful. While in the train it announced each station as well at which side (left or right) was the station. The transfers to another line were also intuitive to understand. The lines as colour code ( red, green , orange, etc). "
Subway transportation,"Using the subway transport system may seem intimidating at first, due to the different lines, but once u get the feel of it, and you know your itinerary, its the easiest transport system to use going around seoul. Our hotel Skypark 1 is in the heart of myeongdong district, just a few meters away from myeongdong station. We rode the line 4, then transferred to line 2 in Sadang going to Gangnam and samseong, when we shopped at SM Artium. We also rode the same line 4 myeongdong station, transferred to line 3 going to insadong to visit gyeongbukchung palace and bukchon hanok village. Practically, the line you ride going to your destination is the same line you'll ride going back. It is convinient to use the TMoney we bought at 7/11, for 2500 skwon. Loaded the TMoney card with 7000 won. There are also stores and shops inside every station, including food stalls, every station has an information office and security staff personnel to assist you if you want to ask for directions, encounter problems like if your Transport card is not functioning, or needs to be reloaded. There are also loading machines, with different languages u can choose if uou have to reload money, also machines to purchase transport cards. One card per person. The only set back in using the subway is going up and down the stairs and escalators. But over all, its good and convenient. The trains and subway stations are wll maintained and very clean."
Best mode of transport if you want to discover Seoul,"I was initially intimidated with the system as it is my first experience in Korea. But once you get pass the first time, it is easy. The ticket machines do need some understanding to work. First the tickets are proximity card which if you purchase add a 500 won to deposit. You can at the end of the journey get a refund from the machine by simply slotting the card. Every station has at least one refund machines. So not issue. Just remember to claim back the deposit."
"Fast, reliable, easy to use!","I was super impressed! SUbway lines are color and number coded; Signs are everywhere, in english, and have the right info to help you.Prices are cheap and you can buy prepaid cards(T-money and some others) that will save you some money and time. Google maps works very well for the system, but not walking directions!"
A great system,"The Seoul Metro system is vast and complete - one can get pretty much anywhere here. Each exit is numbered, which is such a great idea - you can figure out exactly where you are headed before you exit.CAVEAT: the Seoul Metro does not accept credit cards. It is a cash-only system. To further complicate matters I could not find an ATM that would accept my non-Korean debit card. Do thorough research before you go to find out which ATMs in the city you can get cash from. I spent the first three days without being able to use the Metro because I had no cash . . ."
Best way to get around Seoul - And buy a T-Money Card,"Buy a T-Money card. It is the most convenient way to use the Seoul Metro to get around town if you want to use the train, especially since Seoul is very susceptible to rush hour traffic that sometimes the bus isn't really something you'd consider, unless you can spare the time.Using T-Money can also save you a few won here and there, since there are discounted fare prices when you transfer stations.What's great about the Seoul Metro as well is that there are underground shops in stations like Myeongdong and Sinchon."
"Not sure why it is a ""thing to do"" but the train is the best way to get around",Train is the best way to get around the city. Best to get a transit card so you don't need to always buy a train ticket.
Cheap and easy to use,Buy a Tmoney card at the airport and you can get anywhere in Seoul and its surroundings for very little money and no hassle.
Fast travel in Seoul,At first you will be very confused with the subway map (as there are so many stations and exchange stations) but you will get used to it shortly and notice how easy to use the map. The trains are always in time and so far I did not face any troubles using subway.
Wonderful modern Metro service,"Impressed with the cleanliness and organized, efficiency the metro is run. Easy to use and very helpful staff at the service kiosks make for a convenient tourist traveller experience. Ticket prices are reasonable with single journey and multi journey cards available. "
Ease of Travel,The Metro is very easy to navigate. Overall the system is immaculately clean and we'll ordered with destinations displayed in Korean and English.
Very efficient ,"Very efficient and fast network but it takes us a while to understand the map and the colour coding. The colour code is very helpful for the ease of reading.We have met very helpful korean who tries to help us to show how we can take the subway and also kind koreans who give up seats for our children. Unfortunately, we also met unfriendly korean who tried to make our 5 old year give up seat for him. 1 thing which I cant figure out is that though we are expected to travel all the way to the end of the line, some trains do stop along the way and we need to get off to take the next train on the same line. kind of inconvenient as we need to get the kids to get off the train and then wait at the same platform for the next train to continue the journey.Overall a fast and efficent transport network."
Expansive Reach and Easy to Use,"The Seoul Subway System has more than 20 lines and hundreds of stations reaching almost any place in the city. We recommend getting TMoney cards. We were given some by friends who had just visited Seoul and it made travel much easier because we only needed to reload the cards once rather than buy one-way tickets each time (and I believe there is a small additional fee for buying a single trip ticket). The only caution is that at some stations you must know your proper direction before entering the paid area. We mistakenly entered the paid area but had to exit and re-enter because we had entered a side going only one direction. I don't believe we were charged extra for our mistake, just lost a few minutes. "
Seoul Subway Fantastic,"Once you get your head around it. This is a great way to cover ground when exploring Seoul City. Vibrant, lively, you will stand out if you are from the west. No worries as Korean people are kind hearted and generous in nature. They will share local wisdom and food , freely. Buy a subway card for 3,500 Won. Load it up with 10,000 Won and explore this wonderful city."
Easy to use,Metro made it very easy to get around Seoul. I downloaded a metro app and just put in my desired location and got easy directions of which stop to use for each destination. I stayed in primarily tourist areas and got almost everywhere I needed to go within 15 minutes. Fast and easy to navigate.
Different numbers for different things,"We worked out the Seoul Metro - easy when you know how!Initially we bought tickets at the station; then we learnt we could buy a Tmoney card. It's 2500won at a convenience store (7 Eleven), then you load your amount on to the card. The card can be scanned going through the turnstile: much easier! The cost of the fare can be seen when leaving the station, and the total amount left on the card.Train lines are named. Stations have numbers. Tracks are numbered. And the exits are numbered too (maybe take a photo of the exit when you enter).And if you're not sure which platform side you should be on, have a look on the poles/columns: at the stations are there."
It takes you where you want to go! ,The Seoul Metro is quite efficient and in the 12 days I was there I never took the wrong train or had to wait too long for one that I had just missed. I used the metro app and knew when the next train was coming and also which transfers I needed to make along the way. This subway system is extensive and not at all expensive to travel on. Be advised that you're probably going to want to get a T-Money card for easier travel.. I picked mine up at Gimpo International Airport. I had a great time in Seoul and the metro was perfect after a long day of walking around. 
Easy enough to get around,"Although crowded access to it at any time of the day, the metro proved to be a very convenient feature of Seoul. Machines have an option to perform transaction in English. You gotta choose your destination from the alphabetical menu, pay, and voila! ticket in hand."
Confusing mess,Seoul is a very well connected city with transportation everywhere however their metro system is just confusing and an absolute mess. There are dozens of lines/stops/connections-definitely not tourist friendly.
Easy to use,Good transportation easy to use u can paid with t money. To avoid traffic seoul metro is the best way to go anywhere.
Improved lately,Most of our friends are using metro these days because it improved a lot by quality and lines. You can use it easily.
"Punctual, cheap, clean and easy to use...","The subway map is quite large and possibly daunting at first, but I promise you it is very easy to use. Download the subway map on your phone for free (search and find one in your app store) and you can map out the quickest route without needing wifi/data. Go to a station and use a machine to buy a T Money card. You can select 'English' on the machine. It has a couple of different card options, but I'd say you want the T Money card. You can choose between a range of fancy ones, but you really only need the basic one. Put about 5,000 WON on it and see how you get on. If you're running out of cash, the gates won't let you touch in, so you go to the machine and top it up. The stops are either announced in English or appear on a screen in English, so if you listen/look out and have a rough idea of how many stops you're going you can't go wrong. Interchanging can be tricky sometimes. You need to look on a subway map for the last station of the line and direction you want. Follow signs to the line number and final destination. Watch the board on the platform to make sure the train arriving is the final destination you need it to be for your stop.Stand next to the safety doors on the platform where the arrows on the ground indicate the doors will open. You want to try and get a seat, so don't lose your spot in the queue by standing far away. The trains are punctual and run until around midnight I think."
Very convenient and foreigners friendly,I must say this is one of the best metros I've ever taken.You have the choice of using T money or one way coins(ok this is not a new concept but you would be surprised that most metros are not as advanced yet). These t money cards can be used for other purchases(again not new).What I find it very well displayed are the call out to next station in multiple languages and also which side of the train door will it open. The only item I wasn't happy is the number of flight of stairs that I need to walk up and down to get in and out of the station. I must say I have lost a couple of pounds with these exercises every day.The are a lot of stations and some were very close together but going in many different directions. The whole transitway is a big maze.
"Extremely affordable, very convenient and accessible",Once can practically get anywhere using the subway in Seoul. Cost per ride is extremely affordable. Good exercise as it's often quite a walk to change stations and to reach the train platforms.
Not too logical,"It is natural to compare with Tokyo subway/JR.Each transfer takes time and a lot of walking. Moreover , a lot of exits take steeps to walk through. Good as further exercises after a long day walk."
Travel Easy,A good way to travel but can do better with more instructions in english. We had to keep asking about the directions of the trains as instructions was not written on every pillar.
Awesome,"I was awed by the subway system . its like a building where the city is the ground floor and the subway is the basement 1 and basement 2. How I wish our country can have something like this. You can go anywhere, even at rush hour its not crowded, maybe because of the extent and many lines."
"Extremely convenient, fast, and affordable ","Getting a T money card is a must as it saves you 100 krw on each trip. The cost is 3,000 krw for a basic card or 4,000 krw for a decorative one. Alternatively I saw a double couples 2 cards for 7,000 krw. This mode of public transportation is the best I have ever used. The trip for a one way ride is just 1,250 with a t money card until a certain distance, its fantastic."
Good Transport System Easy to Use,If you have been on the London Underground or the Paris Metro (or on any underground services) then this works just the same way. They have their version of an oyster card which are really easy to load with money or you can use contactless cards. I found it very easy to use and we didn't experience any delays
Superior Seoul transportation,"A wonderful transport system, very easy to use and a great range of stations in the underground system, very convenient to all tourist sites. "
Get an APP!,got an app and then it became easy to navagate. Subway is clean and runs on time. For some reason they shut down at night and cabs are iffy at best
Seoul Metro,"very easy to use. signs are in English and Korean. buy a T money card at any seven 11 or GS25 store and load KRW on it. you are all set to see the city !! safe, clean and easy to use !!"
Fantastic metro and very clean,"Clean toliets in every station, well signposted and always on time :-). One of the best metros in the world!"
Best way of transportation when in seoul,"Very good network and although can be tricky in some stations, it was generally easy to understand. It can get you almost everywhere but be mindful of the closing times as it varies from station to station. There are a lot of little shopping centres in some stations that are worth walking through. "
Good way of moving around in the city,"A very easy way to move around in the city. The ticket machines can be operated in English, that makes it very easy. You need to deposit 1000 Wong for the card, but you get it back, when you return it. taxis are also very cheap in Seoul, but not the black ones. "
Convenient and puncture,"Public transportation in Seoul is puncture by the time. Metro is come frequently, very convenient for travellers."
"Very effcient, rapid transport",Very dense and efficient network. All information also available in English. Get a city map with the network of use the local app.
Incredibly easy to navigate and very cheap,"The BEST way to get around Seoul. If you've been on any other subway in the World, this is one of the easiest to navigate. We bought a $3 card and then added $10 and it lasted us the entire 3 1/2 days we were visiting. Keeping them for our return visit. "
Difficult to understand,Used the metro to get from the airport to our hotel. There was a person there that helped us get our ticket. We ended up not getting the express since we would have to wait over 40 minutes. The train station was clean. We had two carryon suitcases. You have to go up the stairs with them. There is an inclined area where you can roll up your suitcase while you walk up the stairs so it is not user friendly. We then tried to use the metro around Seoul. The English directions did not help since the locations are not in English. There wasn't anyone there to help us so bottom line the rail system wasn't an option for us. I will say the Korean people were extremely helpful trying to communicate with us and help us. 
Can eat and drink,"Coming from Singapore, I found it surprisingly good that food and drinks can be consumed in the Metro. Maybe it shows that the people in Korea are so self aware of their actions, that allowing food and drinks in the Metro does not ends up witht eh train compartment being soiled and dirty."
Very efficient & Clean 👍😎,Subway in Seoul Korea her very efficient and extremely clean. Most of the passengers are very courteous and respectful and help you out with directions if the understanding English.
"Delightful Metro, wide area ,cheap and convenient","if you are in Seoul do use the Metro, its really convenient , has many stations and a really wide net. One can get to all tourist sights using the Metro and connecting buses.  additionally its very cheap compared to the West. A journey of any length is only KRW1,200 - 1400 won. ( with a T card). and what is a T Money card ? its like Electronic Purse on the card. You can use it for small purchases at shops and also for buses and the Metro. Using the T card gives you a discount on bus and metro travel , all the more reason to use one. For us foreigners , please be aware that at the end of each carriage, there is a section designated for elderly and physically challenged. You will know these seats because the young Koreans won't sit on them, even when the train / Metro is packed. I have seen a few koreans going '"" tut, tut these uncivilized non Koreans'. so if your young mom/ aunty is sitting on them , ask them to move. They are for the older folks doddering along. And please queue like all the other Koreans, when entering the carriages. They queue in long rows to get into the carriages except for some visitors who insist on jumping the queue. i cringe when i see that. What must they think of foreigners ?"
Use the app,"This metro is really easy to use and cheap, I recommend to get the Korean metro app for your phone because it takes the guess work out of where you have to go it easier enough tells you what car to be so when transferring to another line you won't get lost "
Worth it just for the fanfare played when a train arrives,"I kid you not, a little trumpet fanfare plays to announce the arrival of the train! Fabulous! If only that happened on the London Underground."
Convenient transport ,There is express and normal train and it's better to check out what type of train is arriving. The monitor shows a little train coming at the bottom which I think is quite convenient and cute. The only thing is that you will need to walk a lot when interchange line. 
Efficient,There was no problems being a tourist here. We used the metro all the time and it was a very efficient mean of transportation.
clean and reliable,"the seoul metro almost cover every place. the trains are always clean, safe and the announcement also speak english, japanese and chinese."
Large network but quite confusing,Very clean. limited to no English signs. Prepare your itinerary in advance. Could be a nice adventure. Would recommend.
Download the app!,"With the Seoul Subway app, you won't have any problems! This metro system was very easy to figure out and was much less terrifying than the Tokyo metro ;)"
After one day to get oriented easy traveling,"On a trip to see my brother (a very good local guide) in Seoul, my teenage daughter and I were there on our own some of the time. After one day of taking the metro with our guide, we managed to navigate the organization of the system without any Korean language skill besides ""thank you"".Highly recommend you take this mode to get anywhere you want including home to the airport."
Convenient,"Convenient. Clear instructions. You'd better buy a T-money card, it'll let your travel much more convenient!!"
Best in the World,"I've been all over the world and I've never found a metro system easier to use than Seoul's. I wish we had such efficient, clean, safe, affordable, and welcoming subway systems in American cities."
Clean and convenient ,"The stations and trains are very clean, safe and easy to use. It is a much more affordable mode of transportation than taking a taxi."
Best Public Transportation in Seoul,Seoul metro is best way to go around the city. Every major tourist attraction is connected by metro. Best thing is you can continue your journey on to the public bus with metro card or T money card.
Good Subway Networks in the South Korea,"Seoul has one of the good subway networks in the south korea. It covers well the greater Seoul area. I always use Seoul Metro to go to almost everywhere and very clean and fastest, Most of underground stations have underground shopping market."
Seoul Metro? It's answer for traveling in Seoul,"Seoul Metro is awesome! You can't talk about Korean public transportation without Seoul Metro. It's easy and convenience. I recommend you to take Seoul Metro than bus because it's better for travelers. Most Subway stations are easy to find and well written in English!Also,don't forget to buy T-money :D"
Unbelievably Efficient!,"The Seoul railway system is one of the most efficient that I've used. Trains are always on time. Cabin is usually clean. Signs and directions are so clear, even for first time users such as me and my family. Stations are safe, well-lighted, clean and properly ventilated --- not at all dark/dingy/creepy/with suspicious-looking people loitering around."
Subway in Seoul ,"The metrosystem in Seoul is awesome. Every information is given in English among korean...sometimes in Chinese too. Although if it's a sudden info like ""this train is going to change direction"" or something like that....then it's given in korean....but just follow everybody and you be ok! I am the type that is always lost but I made this transportation work. Ofc I was a bit lost now and then but it was easy to ask metro staff for help. U need to know which exit u need to get out from. If you know...life is much easier! If you don't...then you need to walk extra to get to where you need to get.1 this that is bad is the constant ticket buying...I wish they had a day pass or something! Don't lose your ticket card's...they are refundable and 1 card=500 won! Very very easy and safe way of transportation! "
"Mostly good,"," It's usually pretty good, although it's really annoying when they turn off the moving sidewalks and escalators. "
Efficient,"The best way to get around the city, it may be crowded during peak hours, you will be more comfortable during off-peak hours."
Easy to use.,Best way to travel around Seoul and I strongley reccommend using the Metro from the airport to hotel
Easy to use and affordable,"It is really easy to use and it is affordable. You can get around using this 24hrs a day. It is far more affordable than an Uber or a taxi. Download ""Korea Tour"" offline map app for walking and the subway. "
Best metro subway in the world.,"When you are young and travel lightly and can cover lots of distance, do use subway in seoul. They are fantastic. Not complicated fare system like tokyo. Subways, yes you guessed it doubles as escape area in case of war. So if sirens start blaring do run to one of subway entrance and stay down there. Hold out ten thousand won and call one of metro staff and they will tell you how to buy pass that can be used repeatedly. Dont try to figure out by yourself. Just ask any college kids, they will help you, always.Haven't seen anything better in other parts of world."
Very complex network with lots of walki g,"The network of Seoul subway is so impressive. Travelled to many countries and never before I had to walk so much distance for changing line. Some of the subway lines are so deep that it goes to B5 or more. My advice to all using Seoul subway to give ample time for walking, especially when you need to change line and make sure you know the exact exit you should get out to get to where you want. "
Easy to navigate,This is a good option for moving around Seoul - easy to use and easy to navigate with extensive coverage of the city 
Very efficient and reliable! ,The Metro is on time and reliable. There are many tracks available like in Japan. One can buy a card from the airport. You can use it for the bus and Metro. Just reload if you need more. 
"The subway, the best way to get to the Express busstation.","From Seoul to Jeonju; the express bus to Jeonju has to be taken at the express busstation. the best way to get there is by subway. The ride is comfortable all the stops are shown in Korean and in english on the board so it is easy to know where to get off.Buying subway tickets is also easy because there are English machines and korean machines to purchase your tickets. finding your way in the subway corridors is also easy, just look for the right sign and line. the best thing is to check your exit on before hand that safes searching ."
Umm,My first night in this station I lost my wallet and passport there but I didn't get them back. There are a lot of homeless
Excellent public transportation system,"Cheap, quick and convenient. Air-conditioned interiors. Overall quite clean (although not as clean as the Japanese systems). Can get very busy during rush hours. Some subway stations are not accessibility-friendly."
Highly Efficient Transportation,"Three major Asian cities have impressed me with their subway systems and Seoul deserves this recognition.I found an Android (Apple also) which provides you an offline resource to know any part of this system.As an English only speaking person, I was able to navigate the automatic machines to purchase my subway cards with issues. And sprinkled liberally around the passenger ingress / egress points for the trains is clear labeling of the prior and next stop.We are on day five of our visit and have either used the subway or our feet for transportation.By using the subway, we stayed just a little further outside of the dense city center and were rewarded with much more value for our hotel dollar.The trips are each just over one US dollar.If I have any advice:A. Use your smartphone and download one of the many apps to give you the route information when you are not connected to the internet.B. Get a GPS tracking app and as you exit from a new subway stop' take a GPS fix so you can find your way back easily.C. Load up extra funds on your subway card. On the last day of your stay, you can get a refund.D. Stay away from the logical rush hour times. We found the people in Seoul subways to be much more polite than in some other cities; but there are just so many people using the system during peak times.E. It may sound counter-intuitive, but when you plan your excursion it is usually better to minimize transfers between lines. Each transfer involves a long walk, often up and down multiple flights of stairs. Example: The shortest physical distance may well be line 4, then line 1, then line 3. But time-wise, we found it so much easier to stay on line 4 until it crossed line 3. This eliminates one very long walk.F. Each person must have their own subway card. I tested it at least twice, and was NOT able to use my card twice at the entry point. It is probably better this way as it prevents accidental 'double-tap' payments."
Best metro in the world,"I've tried a lot of Europe's and some of the USA's metro, but nothing beats Seoul's. Your mobile network still works, it's really clean and safe, it's always on time and lines are very logic and marked with English everywhere. Also, you have restrooms and shopping areas in almost all of the stations!"
Best way to commute in seoul,Seoul metro is the best public transport option to commute from one place to the other. Almost all places are well connected and it is reasonably priced. You just need to identify the closest metro station to the place you want to go . We went to gimpo airport to take a domestic flight . Taxi would have cost 50K while metro cost us 4k ...Not bad I would say !!!
Need to travel on tube as Seoul huge ,You need a hand from the guard on how to buy a travel card . And then need to top up if runs out . There are a few tube lines . Most people are glued to their mobiles on the tube and some loud talking . You can see where the next train is on the monitor . Maybe 5 mins between trains . Stations have many exits and generally large with shopping or stores linked . It's too far to walk around so tube necessary . 
Fantastic transportation system.,"I use Seoul's subway system as well as the public bus system. The subway system is easy to navigate and very affordable. Each station has its own style and artwork, and many have small shops or even shopping malls. "
Best metro i have ever seen,"Clean, disabled friendly, frequent schedule, announcement of stops in English too. Quite easy to understand direction and stops. One thing i did not like much was cash only ticket machines."
Very Convenient ,"It was initially difficult to figure out their train system owing to the absence of english descriptions. But after half a day of commuting, we were able to fully comprehend it. Just a tip. Purchase their Discover Seoul Pass exclusive for foreigners. It is notonly a free pass to most popular tourist destinations but you may load money in it and use it like the Octopus card in Hong Kong. You can use it to ride the metro or buy from convenience stores."
Clean and efficient ,"The subway can be a little daunting at first with all the different track lines and colours. The good thing is the ticketing machines are quite intuitive and tourist should buy Single trip tickets I believe with no preset destination. I paid about 1850 Korean won if I recall correctly. The underground shopping complex of the subway station is HUGE! So expect plenty of walking. Overall, the trains are clean and comfortable and locations/stops are indicated in English as well. "
"Clean, cheap, and efficient!","Just re-emphasizing the same points made by lots of other travellers. The Seoul Metro service was great. Get a T-Money card and load as needed. Most rides are about 1200won each way (about USD$1). Great way to get around the city. In addition, most stations are like mini-shopping centers. Safe, cheap, clean, and efficient. You can't ask for anything more. Similar to Tokyo, Taipei, or Singapore Metro if you are familiar with those metro systems."
Excellent way to travel,"Don't be intimidated by looking at the metro map! Once you get started, it's relatively easy. Signs are everywhere, and easily understood. Announcements on (some) trains makes it even easier, sometimes in Korean, English, Chinese and Japanese. My advice is do not panic. Stay calm, read the signs re transfers and routes, and you will be alright."
Easy and cheap. ,"Easy and cheap. I've now lived in Seoul for almost 2 years and I've never had a complaint about the subway. Ive never had a problem or complaint about the subway. Well except from when people go to and from work, but the crowd is inevitable. "
Good,Nice and cheap ! There are so many different lines.but transportation not difficult.i was satisfied!
Quite easy and fast,The fastest and cheapest way for moving in Seoul. Buy a Tmoney card that is a rechargeable card for tickets
efficient,"The tube service is quick and efficient. However, at some stations, there are long walkways for transits. Morning and evening rush hours are very packed and you should try to avoid these times as a tourist.The tickets are not expensive (around 1000won) when moving around town and most attractions are on Line 1. "
Well organized and traveler-friendly metro system,"We bought a T-money card at Incheon airport (4000w/card) and reload 35.000w for our 2days trips in Seoul (mostly used metro) and 3days in Jeju (used buses). With Tmoney you can easily use subway, bus and taxi. reload at every convenience stores and subway stations. It can also be refunded if you don't want to use the card and take the balance in the card back.It's so convenient to travel around the city by its metro system. well-organized, clearly instruction in English, Chinese and Japanese. The Seoul station is a huge hub for transportation, so it took us some time to change the line here. we used All stop train from/to Incheon to Seoul station, then changed the Line 1 to our hotel location at Jongnogu, from/to Gimpo for our Jeju trip. we also used line 2 to Ehwa University in the last day. Highly recommended for those who are travelling on a budget."
Seoul Metro,"Safe, clean, efficient, affordable! An easy way to explore the city. Get a Tmoney card and you can also use it for taxi, bus and airport bus"
Clean and on time,The metro is clean and fast. Local are helpful if you get confused about directions. We had an error on getting out the turnstile with the t card and a local helped us by talking to the operator and then opening the gate for us to exit.The metro toilets are extremely clean for a railway toilet- other countries should take note.
best way to get around the city,easy to use and navigate around. Ticketing system is simple and efficient. Great way to get around the city as there is stops at all major attractions.
Most efficient metro i've ever seen,"The metro is the best i have ever seen in any other country, you can get anywhere with it and its very easy to use.Every metro stop has different entrance-exits that have a number of exit so if you want to meet someone is easy to find eachother, also buy the t-money card, you can recharge it in the machines and its cheaper to use the card than a one-way ticket. The station information is multiple languages, korean, chinese, japanese and english so you will always know what station is next, it also indicates which side the door will be opening. T-money cardYou can also use it to pay the bus and the taxi! "
Easy to use especially with App on phone,"Very easy to use especially with an app on your phone, lines are coloured differently and have numbers so pretty simple to understand. Very clean and efficient system (just like rest of South Korea)"
Wear your glasses,"The metroyis great, well organized and explained, so it's clear where to transfer between lines. But the English print on maps is so small I had to strain to make out station names. When finding a place at a given stop, knowing the right station exit number can be crucial."
Best way to get around ,Very well organized and connects the whole city.In almost all stations are restrooms (for free)Make sure to get the Tmoney card (2.500¥) at one of the many terminals. For tourists there are some special cards including a subway map and discount at some stores (4.000¥)For couples there are fun matching designs (2 x 3.500¥)
Very fast & convenient way of touring around seoul,"We spent 7 days in Seoul and we only had 2 days of ktour so we spent 5 days touring around Seoul with the use of subway. Very convenient & so fast, we just bought citypass card so it'sno hassle at all."
Great way to get around Seoul,"Great way to get around and see all of Seoul, South Korea.However I would recommend avoiding during rush hour if possable."
"Easy, clean, quiet","The Seoul Metro was a breeze to use. It could be crowded, but it was super easy to figure out where you were going....except one area where you had to get out and switch.Also - there is a bit of a wait between certain trains.BUT - being from NYC....this was easy, clean, and quiet."
metro gets you almost any where,I was in Seoul for a tradeshow at Kintex and took the metro everyday. Its cheap but long 1 hour but better than being stuck in traffic.
public transport,"Public transport were good,on time but travelling with out local people will be hard, language barriers were difficult almost all the street signs& information were written in Korean . Not many people understand english."
Great,"I go to work everyday using this subway and it is truly great, its clean on time and fast. Thank you."
Local Transport,"Seoul metro is very efficient,clean and relatively easy to use. Fare is around £1 for journeys upto 6 mile you can change lines at various transfer stations for free at other stations beware.Extremely busy at rush hour but rest of time it's quite easy to get about"
Can be tricky,"The ticket vending machines and the announcement in the trains are fine. They do that in Korean, English, Mandarin and Japanese. It's on the platform that things get tricky for tourist as you need to know the direction you are heading. We had one trip where the train just stopped, they switched off the lights and everyone alighted. We didn't know which platform to go to but managed to get some help following some international students. Other than that it is safe and easy enough."
"Easy to navigate, cheaper transportation and clear signs are provided","It was a comfortable journey using the subway. Per trip costs approx, 1,350 korean won. If you would use the subway for the rest of your stay, it is practical and convenient to buy a T-money card (Cheapest is 2,500 won for the card alone at GS25, a convenience store). Download the app ""Subway"" with a blue train icon to help you out through your navigation. Signs were very clear and specific so no need to worry. Just incase youre in an old train with no voice translations regarding the train stp-over, you may refer to the screens/ monitors inside the train. Also make sure to take note of the exit gates closest to your destination, or else you'll get far from your destination. Long walks are normal so make sure to wear comfortable footwear.The subway closes at 11pm or earlier so make sure to get on the subway before 11pm if youre trying to go on a budget."
Easy to Navigate Anywhere...at times,"The Seoul Metro is amazing - buying tickets and navigating around Korea is not an issue as long as you know how to read the map. However, there's times where they choose to omit English completely, and the metro unfortunately closes around 11PM. Despite all this, it's a prime choice of transportaion."
on time,It's so very easy to get a train in Seoul. also a very helpful signs to show which directions or train should we take. 
Destination to reach Gangchon Rail Bike,A very pleasant journey - the train is very cleaned and comfortable. The rides were wonderful with the train moving very steadily and smooth. Thumbs up!
Clean and quite efficient,"Efficient, clean, inexpensive. Crowded at peak hours. As compared to similar systems in US metropolitan areas way better. The only problem, young people do not give their seats to older individuals (they are old busy with their smart phones and pretend to ignore their surroundings."
Every city should be as well connected,"Such a great transport system. Runs til around midnight, this subway system is clean, fast, easy to use (english on display) and very affordable. There are plenty of stations so getting to one never takes long and I don't think we ever waited more than 5 minutes for any train. It is very well kept but on our first day we did witness someone, who was clearly inebriated, throw up. For a country where public alcohol consumption is legal this wasn't very surprising and none of the other passengers seemed to be surprised either so just heads up on that. Do make sure you stay clear of the priority seats indicated by the stickers above them, they are for the disabled, pregnant and elderly, and there are generally quite a lot of elderly out and about so steer clear to avoid being scolded. The ajumma scolding is REAL. We witnessed this countless times, many times the ajummas were scolding scantily clad Korean teens."
Get's you everywhere,"Easy to use and fairly cheap. Get's you everywhere. Very big stations,ticketmachines and everything is also sighnposted in english."
"New, efficient but Directions","A little difficult for Anglos. Doesn't seem consistent in naming tracks, end of line stations or next one, anyways was a puzzle to decide where track was. And not enough "" you are here"" red dots on the maps. But overall pretty flexible for a large multi line system, many pathways available, long stay residents may get used to the idiosyncrasies.Nice T-money reloadable card or single-ride passes, nice double door system, clean cars, riders have good etiquette. Felt safe and reliable."
"Quiet, clean and efficient!","We have ridden trains in a lot of cities and can say the subway in Seoul is top notch. Pretty easy to navigate with a bit of study. Always someone on hand to help with questions. Quiet, no graffiti and very clean! Great transport option!"
"Fast, affordable & easy to use","The metro here is brilliant, fast & easy to use.Card system similar to Oyster Card in London.Many lines, so plan ahead, & check your exit as the stations cam have 9+ exits.."
Good,Eady to use. Good cover of Seoul. Gets you to Gimpo a/p and to train for Inceon a/p. Low price and comfortable
Holiday in Seoul,Easy to get around Seoul and suburbs. Very efficient transportation services. Courteous staff and drivers.
Easy to move about,"We install an app called ""Subway Korea"" on our HP whereby it makes it much easier to know the shortest and best transfers between the lines in the subway. Those going Korea should try to install this app to find your way in a more efficient way."
The Seoul Metro is clean and efficient,The Seoul Subway is very comfort and unexpensive way to move around Seoul.It is clean and all signs are in English as well.
Seoul Metro,"Seoul Metro is easy to use and has directions in Korean, Japanese, Mandarin and English. I found the style similar to Paris and London where to need to know which direction, and hence which side of the platform, you are going to get on the right train. Maps with the direction, where you currently are and where you are going are on each platform and inside the train. Announcements are made in all those languages. Beware there are sometimes lots of stairs and no escalators.Tickets can be obtaoned by easy to use machines where you can choose the same languages as above. You just enter your final destination and it works out costs. We only used the single use tickets as we didnt know how much travel we were going to do. This was still quite inexpensive and easy to do.The metro system in Seoul is excellent and easy to use."
The best way to travel around Seoul,"I would say this is the best subway service in the world. Clean, efficient and always on time. Its essential that your purchase a T-Money card when you arrive in Seoul. "
Seoul in Februari!,"Seoul in South Korea is a Fantastic Place,i happend to be there in February so it was pretty cold but a visit in june is fantastic!The old part of Seoul is really cool and the Markets or the palace is well worth visit if your there!Korea South is a fantastic place so don't miss it!!"
Best way to travel,I always use and rely on Seoul Metro to get me everywhere in Seoul. The trains for the most part arrives on time.
Really nice place to lost,"Really chaotic place. You have to use a navigation when you want to travel somewhere, lot of station is written in Korean language"
"CCC - crouded, clean, comfortable","I would call Seoul metro ""CCC"" - crouded, clean, comfortable. Every sign is marked with English letters so you wounlt get lost. System is easy to follow, distances are really long. Take note to check the number of exit otherwise you will have problems as sometimes the quantity of exists from one station is more than 10. "
Expect to stand,A cheap and efficient subway network. Giving your seat up for the elderly is welcomed whereas offering your seat for a lady is politely rejected.
most convenient way too travel around town.,most convenient way too travel around town and easiest way to travel. cheap way to travel but may be crowded.
Very easy to use,"Metro and buses are very efficient and easy to use. The city is huge, so you will need it most likely. "
Seoul Metro,Great Subway system that you can take you almost anywhere in Seoul. It is cheap and easy to refill your card at any convenience store in Seoul. 
Easy,"Very straightforward system, the use of English on maps, signs and in announcements made this one of the easiest foreign subway systems I have used.Clearly a well thought out network that is easy to navigate. Trains were clean and in good state of repair, stations likewise, and the cost was very affordable (around £1.50 per single journey).Didn't use any overground transport in Seoul such was the ease of use on the Underground"
Efficient and easy to use,All information are provided in English and Korean. Easy to find your way. A lot of stairs to climb if you have luggages. 
Easy way to get around,"Taxis here are relatively inexpensive but like NYC, not always easy to find. I didn't get an international sim so I didn't have ability to get an Uber app here. So the metro was very convenient for us. One day it was heavy rain, so we decided to grab a taxi. By the time we tried hailing one, 10 minutes later, we gave up. We walked to Metro in no time, (there every few blocks away it seemed like), and although it was crowded, we were out of the rain and we knew we were able to get where we wanted. If you don't like crowds and having to spend some time navigating, metro is not for you. Have the Conceirge at your hotel, call a taxi for you, "
The way to get around Seoul,"Can't speak highly enough of the efficient metro system in Seoul. Its expanse is also rather stunning. The cars are clean. Signage is also in English so all you have to figure out is the direction of travel. Several times locals were more than willing to help in that regard. Getting off is easy too with signs in English. It is relatively inexpensive compared to rates in Toronto. Excellent work, Seoul!"
Best public transportation system I've encountered the world over,"Phenomenally efficient, this metro goes everywhere you'd ever need to go. Supplement it with buses and you truly can go door to door between any two places in Seoul and beyond. "
It's the way to travel,"The routes can be intimidating but locals are more than happy to help if you ask. After a couple rides, you get the hang of it. The subway system here is very clean and people are very polite. "
No English Sign,The Seoul Metro is not very easy to take if you're a foreigners and do not know how to read their Korean words. There was not enough English signs or indication on every stations. It was quite tough to look out for the stations to board and alight. It can be quite confusing and difficult. Have to take quite a while to figure out how to go from one station to another. 
Efficient,"The only problem is that Seoul is so vast that the stations are not near enough to the attractions. Either way, we made our way round just fine. The stations and carriages are clean and efficient and the journeys are reasonably priced ."
Huge and good network covering greater Seoul,"Seoul has one of the best subway networks in the world. It covers well the greater Seoul area. It is best to download metro app to your phone because system is quite complicated and there are many stations. Sometimes it is also difficult to estimate what is the fastest route. Metro station names are sometimes very close to each other and names are not always written in the same way with Latin alphabets. It is better to double check the name before traveling. Some metro stations are huge and it is better to check before hand what exit to take. Some busy hours metro is really crowded and be prepared that there are no seats available. Especially faster express metros tend to be fully packed of people during the rush hours. Sometimes it needs courage to push people to fit in. Some metros don't travel all the way from one end to another but you have to unload even twice and wait the next train.You can buy T-money card from metro stations and convenience stores. Load money to card and you can use it in metro, bus, taxi and even pay in convenience stores. You can switch between metro and bus but please remember you have to check in and also out of the bus. There small black box next to bus doors. There are usually taxis available with cheap price at Metro stations and all the places in Seoul are easily reachable."
Huge,"The subway line could be confusing for foreigner in the beginning. And sometimes, could be misleading on the subway entrance as well. For example, DongDaemun history and cultural park exit 6 and 7. On the entrance, we got the impression that it is the entrance for green, purple and blue line. Apparently, exit 6 and 7 is the nearest entrance to purple only. If you are taking blue line or green... It is faaaaarrr farrrrr away. And I hate the fact that not all the subway station has escalator, especially when you have so many things to bring. When in Seoul, I found bus is much more comfortable comparing to subway. I prefer taking bus instead of subway"
A most efficient metro,Punctual Clean efficient and modern transit system connecting to lines all over South Korea. I went all over Seoul and to Suwon a fortress city and Incheon a major port.
Quite easy to navigate,"Train stations are extensive and can reach almost any tourist attraction. The cheapest card is the purple tourist card costing KRW3,000 which has no stored value. You need to top up before you can use it. Remaining value is not refundable, the minimum top up value is KRW1,000. "
The best way to move to complete taxi,I love seoul metro! So clean so well organized! And not so expensive. With taxi and metro! Seoul is yours!!
Excellent service on modern trains.,"Tickets had to be bought from vending machines. The trains were clean, fast, and there were glass screens on platforms that open when the train stops."
Reliable and affordable,"The trains came on time and were very clean. They were sometimes packed at rush hour but that's expected. Stops were announced in English, Korean, Chinese and Japanese and most trains have a light-up map that you can follow to see where you are."
Super Convenient,"I experienced Seoul Metro with my friend in summer. It was totally different from NYC subway and local metro in US. There were tons of air conditioners right above our head for humid summer in Korea. Also several screens entertained us along our way including travel tips and news channels. We thought of us privileged to save our money by using public transportation that was clean, comfortable, and economical. We virtually used less than $5 per person for 1 day full pass. The railway passes through the entire capital area and all metro areas as well. Though some popular rails are as crowded as Tokyo's, we enjoyed comfortable rides all month of our trip. In fact, Seoul metro is the first major city subway ever to establish glass door at the station for safety. We strongly recommend ridong Seoul Metro."
So easy to get around!,Like most undergrounds and metro's - Seoul's metro is easy to use. As the map has English words also. And I love how most stations show when the train is approaching (i.e. how far away it is)
The most efficient metro system I've ever used,"The Seoul metro system was incredible - so efficient, clean, and safe. It blows Paris, NYC, London, etc completely out of the water. I don't speak Korean and had zero problems navigating the vast public transit (including buses). Make sure you buy a metro card before you go down into the train stations - you can re-load them there but not always purchase one. And you usually have to put cash in the machines, they won't accept cards. "
"Very efficient, with many an available line.","Having lived in/near Seoul for at least 3.5 yrs, I can safely comment about the Seoul Metro. Its one of the best there is. I am well experienced with catching lines 1,2,3,4,5,6, and 8. The Seoul Metro is extremely efficient, the trains are very regular, and they do not run a minute late. The metro covers all parts of Seoul, and all the major attractions and things to do are close to a metro station. You will not be disappointed. "
easy to use and expensive way to get around,"Took subway from airport to City Hall. Easy to use, English is also on the maps. My only complaint is there are a lot of stairs, after a long day of sightseeing. "
Brilliant system,Fully recommend. Do buy a op up card for ease in getting around.All the main attractions in the city are covered. Signage in English.Can get congested at peak times. First and last coaches usually free.
Transport,Easy to use once you get the hang of it - and cheap. Using the T-Money card is essential but easy to set up and quicker than buying individual tickets
Love it! So easy to get around,Easiest way to navigate the city. We bought a T money card which has been great! The subway app also really helps plan journeys
This is not an attraction,"The most confusing part about the Seoul ""Things To Do"" section on this site is the fact that Seoul Metro is the number one attraction. It's a mode of transportation. You don't come to Seoul, or any city, to visit the metro. It is an efficient and easy mode of transportation that stretches across pretty much anything you want to see in Seoul, but it is still just a mode of transportation. If you visited Seoul and somehow managed not to use public transport, then you probably have money and are not using TA to plan your trip. ""Is this attraction accessible using public transportation?"" Ummm, sure."
great experience,I have stayed for few times in Seoul already. The Metro is safe and clean. Even without knowing or understanding korean is easy to get around. I have downloaded an app in my phone to know where I am going. Useful is to buy T-money card . Don't forget to pass it through the machine again when you leave the station. !! 
Seoul Metro is excellent,"Have visited South Korea 6 times in 2 years and although I mainly stayed with Family near Ansan I found the Seoul Metro easy to negotiate with signage and announcements in many languages including English. if I ever had a problem the Station personnel or even fellow passengers were very helpful.The ticketing system is excellent and you get a a portion of your fare refunded at the machines in the stations, which are usually just outside the ticket barriers. If you miss one train there is another one along within minutes. I traveled both in daylight and after dark and was never worried.A few cities could learn a lot from the efficiency of the Seoul Metro."
User friendly for foreigners,"Best part - efficient, on time, signs in english, clean, beats traffic.Not to good parts - looong distances to travel between exits so be prepared to walk a lot still. Sometimes we opted for a taxi to sightsee and rest our feet but mostly took the metro as it is efficient and cheap. Buy a t-money card at any convience store at the stations and fill it up. Cute motives on the cards that make great souvenirs. If you've ever taken the metro anywhere like in D.C., Paris, or London then it will be a breeze to use. "
Convenient and affordable ,"The subway is very easy to used once u understand n familiar with the route.. at first we hv no idea and kindda lost with the system but shortly we easily understand. U can download korea subwAy apps for better understanding... subway is very clean ... the cheapest mean of transportation in korea by far... T money is very essential and must have.. we spend approximately 40,000w for our 5day stay.. u can used Tmoney for the teksi n bus.. u can buy Tmoney card at convenient store at the subway for 4,000w each and just topup ur desire amount at the ATM provided.. if there is balanced in ur Tmoney card u can withdraw the money but we didn't withdraw since we planning to go for the 2nd trip since Tmoney card had no expiration date... "
Tourist friendly Metro,"We used the Seoul Metro blue line #4once to travel from Dongdaemun History anf Culture Park Station to Myeong dong shopping malls. The system is quite easy to use, the ticket vending machines have multilinguals cability and accept coins or notes. There several ticket options and they charge you 500won refundable deposit for each ticket. The platform and the train was safe and clean. A lot of signages in English around so we didn't get lost. We were able to save time and money by using the Metro. Highly recommended."
Super Easy to Use,"With the T Money Card travel is fast and easy. Just tap the card when you enter and exit the station and you are on your way. We bought our cards at the 7-Eleven. Only one trip was more than $1,250 Won so we added $5,000 Won each time we filled the card. The other trip was only $100 Won more. Stations are very clean with easy to follow directions."
Very convenient way to travel in Seoul,"It is very convenient to use the metro if you purchase a T card. Just tap in and tap out. Just like travelling on London tubes, please be mindful of the gap in some stations. My 5 year old son actually fell through the gap in one of the stations in Seoul but thankfully a Korean guy swiftly pulled him out from underneath the train platform within seconds. SO do be careful and watch your step especially with kids in tow."
Travelling in Seoul Metro,"This is the fastest and most efficient way of travelling around the city,avoiding the traffic jams,it certainly cost cheaper than taxis.It is also not difficult to understand the routes and your destinations.We went everywhere using the metro to Insadong arts &crafts market,Namdaemun Traditional Market,& Myeongdong where you can buy lots of skincare &clothes just exit 6 when you arrive on the metro."
Convenient subway,"Frequent, punctual, brings you to everywhere in Seoul.Prepaid card reload machine easily available in most station.Most subway station also has toilet, convenient for the tourists.Most subway stations have escalators as well, easy for the tourists who have luggage."
Goes everywhere but long walk,"Useful but long walk between within the stations. Moreover, there are not a lot of escalators or lifts around (although there are some). This makes it hard for seniors. Also be careful of taking the wrong exits which might mean you end up paying unnecessarily when you need to turn back."
Always reliable and clean,"I've been using the Seoul Metro system since 2002 and it never fails to impress me with its reliable service. The system has expanded massively since 2002 and reaches far north, east, south and west. Great for getting out of the city for a day or two. Bicycle friendly too, on weekends."
Massive subway lines!,"One has to go by the colour code or Subway Line numbers. Just take note of the next station , it is the direction that the train will run. Lucky we didnt have to experience the mad rush if we travel off peak period.A subway map is very useful on hand as tourist.I download on to my mobile.Bought a TMoney like our MRT card in Singapore. The KWR4000 is non refundable. This is very useful for us to use on buses and subways. There are no offices only machines to get the TMoney passes or one way tickets. Quite easy to use."
South Korea trip 2017,"clean and well maintained coaches,always on time,feel secured anytime you travelled, staff and people are friendly"
Must for long distance travel in seoul,During pick hours its traffic in the city so travelling by metro is very convenient. Though it is little costly if you have to travel for short distance. Most of underground stations have underground shopping market. 
very convenient,"As far as subway systems go, this one is pretty extensive and pretty easy to figure out. Buying tickets and figuring out transfers was surprisingly easy considering I don't speak or read Korean"
Tanara N,You can go anywhere by subway. But I think it early close. Can't hangout and back by subway before 12:00am. 
One of the best metro networks,Metro system very well set up. The trains come very fast. The signalization is very good. The t-money payment system is very easy to use
Totally Reliable,"This is a great way to get around that's for sure. So efficient and easy. Not a moment when I don't feel safe using the Metro. It's nice, clean, orderly and just reliable."
Just a step away from being perfect,"Seoul Metro is very convenient. Seoul is a very expensive city for tourist so taking metro let you save money without loosing time. Just one issue, that it's not always easy to navigate at stations for a new-comer."
Spacious carriages,"Very well connected, but maps are not great , a perfect improvement would be to be able to use the touchscreens and type the destination where you want to go, then be shown the route to take including line changes. (Particularly because google maps and apple maps do not really work well and if you ask locals not many speak english). So we found a not so practical way to find out how to get to our destination by zooming in & out on the touchscreen then hitting back button. A bit frustrating but workable. I did not feel like paying for apps to give you directions that will consume your phone battery. A hint: Try replicating the App done by Singapore called Go There.SG ;)"
The subway station,"I like the convenience of a subway ride here. But I do not like the manners here. Especially bad guy manners. I dreamed with kindness. Through the drama I see Oh, it's not true, I love Korea. But I would not come here again. Even get a free plane ticket."
Easy to use,"Excellent metro subway station.Get a T-Money card and charge it up at a local kiosk in a subway station. You can do it in English too.Easy to navigate the system - clean, safe, and fast.I got a subway map at my hotel and it was easy to master the lines - each line is referenced by both line number and color."
Pretty Easy Once You Get Used To It,"Being used to the HK MTR and the Singapore Subway, it was difficult understanding how to work the Seoul Metro. But once you get used to it, you'll understand how to go around.I didn't get the prepaid card, I more or less bought a ticket per trip. They have many different lines and transfers which made it confusing."
Tiring walk on metro stairs,"Connectivity in seoul via metro is good, there have many lines. The set back is, there is very limited escalators at the metro stations. One have to walk up and down from platform to platform and using stairs platform to exit. It can be very tiring. In addition the English wordings fonts on the station maps are extremely small, one really have to squeeze the eyes to read it"
Great subway system ,"Huge system that is clean, neat, and quiet. Very efficient! It goes all over and very inexpensive to use."
loved this,Gongdoek station is right downstairs of Lotte Castle Hotel. Love! I would stay at this hotel every time I am in seoul.
Senior Deputy of The Court of Appeal,"Clean, safe and the locals were helpful in helping me with the address of where I'm going to and which line to take."
Very complicated,Very complicated with lot of lines however there are NOT enough English sings. Many exists do not have escalators- just stairways and it is very hard if you carry language. I was very upset because of that.
A good efficient and cheap way to explore!,A great metro that gets you where you need to go! Only negatives were that I couldn't see how to purchase an all day ticket and there was little notice on the train itself of the station names in English alphabet. So pay attention to your maps or the stop signage 
Awesome Ride !,"Easy, clean and cheap to travel. The staff s friendly and helpful evevn though we were lost. Definitely the smooth ride around Seoul !"
1234 line is dirty and full with people. 5678 line is quite clean and young.,I recommend you ride a metro line 5678.there are young people and young train. it feels like a being clean city
Efficient metro service,"Wow what an awesome metro service. Clean, runs on time and easy to use. Announcement are both verbal and visual so can't get lost. Amazing how helpful people are."
Great way to travel around Seoul,"Great train system with frequent services. Ticket machines offer 4 languages and purchasing is very easy. Carriages are always clean. Many transfer stations with only a few minutes wait for the next train. Stations have clear signage in both Korean and english making navigating the metro easy. If you purchase a single use ticket, you pay the fare plus a 'deposit' which you get back when you exit - just after the exit gates you will find deposit refund machines into which you insert your ticket in return for your deposit."
❤ it! ,"Very very convenient and hassle free. It's a time saver too. Inside the subway, Sign directions are easy to understand and accurate. Fast food and the shopping area also come in handy. I just love Seoul Metro. ☺❤"
Fantastic public transport system,"There are so many things I like about the Seoul Metro and there are a few things worth be aware of.1) Don't bother buying tickets. Just buy an inexpensive T-money card or equivalent and top it up (we borrow ours from a friend who have been to Korea before and the AirBnB we rented also have them). We just top ours up when we landed in Incheon Intl Airport. Hassle free and can be used on buses as well and outside of Seoul - we also used ours in Busan and Gyeongju and would have used them in Jeju if we didn't hire a car.2) Get an app. We used the free Subway Korea app by Malang Studio - a great app. Just enter your starting and arrival stations and it gives you the best and fastest route - where to change trains, which carriage and door to use so you can transfer quicker, the time required to walk between platforms, and how much it costs.3) The signage at the stations and on the trains are generally very clear and in both Korean and English. The announcements - the same. On some lines, it includes Japanese and Mandarin. If you can't hear very well, there are LCD or TV displays either in the middle of the train or above the doors. However, going to the correct platform can sometimes be confusing. Do not assume that the platform for a line is always in the center and hence you can move over to the opposite side if you are on the wrong side. Because of this, there were a number of times I used the app to identify which platform to head to go to because the signage at the station would probably show the terminal stations of the line. Once you get to the correct platform, the signage on the doors at the platform is very clear - always show the current station name, the station it came from and the next station it is headed to.4) The lines. There are a number of lines to be aware of. 9 of them are identified by numbers on the maps, in the trains for changing to connecting lines, on station signages and in the app. There is also the airport railroad line which runs between Seoul Incheon Intl Airport and passes thru Gimpo Intl Airport. And there are a few lines run by Korail which gets further out of the city and connecting to them is pretty easy but these are not numbered. We used one of them to get to Gapyeong (where we then took a bus to Nami Island). Also some lines have short ride interconnecting trains that bring you to the ""main"" line, eg. on line 2, the short ride interconnecting train runs from Kkachisan to Sindorim where you then change to the ""main"" line 2 train which is a loop train.5) The cost. Public transportation is cheap and does now blow your budget. Most journeys within the Seoul metro area costs 1250 won - a little over US$1 - per trip. We took a train (changed twice) from Kkhacisan to Gapyeong and it costs less than the cost of a cheap meal - a journey over 60 km and 1.5 hours later...6) The crowd. My observation is not to make assumptions about peak and non-peak travel times especially weekends. Seoul is a big densely populated city. Many Seoulites live in apartments and appear to get out of their cramped accommodation and head out somewhere. Some train rides can be long and given the nature of the available seats - 2 rows of seats along the windows, chances of getting a seat is often slim. There a designated seats for the elderly, disabled, pregnant but they also get taken up sometimes by those not fitting into the categories. It is rare for Seoulites to give up their seats to those more deserving."
World best metro,"I have not tried all metro in the world, but the 10 lines in Seoul is very easy and pleasant to use. The T-money card is useful for foreigners too, even for a short stay. "
Easy to use,"Easy to use, super clean and cheap.Colors, signs in English and many maps available on site. Fastest way to get distances in Seoul."
Easy to use,"Good direction,so easy to find way where shoud do.transfer or exit.but in some area direction its no clear.so hard to find."
Effecient and easy to use,"The Seoul metro is surprisingly easy to use and very efficient. Signs and announcements are in English, which is very helpful. You really should invest in a T-money card, which are available from convenience stores everywhere. You can load this up with money at machines found at all stations (instructions in English). The card can then be used in buses and metro trains all over South Korea, so really does make a lot of sense."
"Very convenient, economic way to get around the city","Very good and easy to travel and transfer the line even I can't read Korean. There is English on the map and in most compartments, digital and verbal announcement Really easy to understandHowever, most of the station doesn't have escalator and in big station where you can change line, maybe you will walk a long way. This is not good for elderly and those carrying a lots of things. As for the price, it is very reasonable "
Nothing special,Just another metro... Covers all places but difficult for tourist... It will take couple of days to learn.... No information desk to help the tourist... You have to wait until you find someone who speak English... Price is very cheap... Clean... Slow...
suggested transportation in seoul,"When you go to Seoul, better to use metro (subway) because it's easy to understand the route. Also, if you read the korea travel guide, they mostly giving you direction using metro. If you want to use bus, then you better know the language because it has not any english sign. they use hangul, so you better know how to read them or you'll lost your way!! "
Easy to use,"We used the Seoul Metro daily during our stay in Seoul, and it was very easy to navigate and a cheap option for travelling. Highly recommended and very clean."
Large Efficient System,"The subway covers most of the city, it was easy to buy tickets and transfer trains. Announcements were made in Korean and English before each stop. The trains were very clean and people were friendly. Don't go during rush hour (9 am. and 6 pm) We had teenagers with us. Our 15 year old was letting on someone in front of him when the doors closed and we left with out him. Good thing we had a plan in case this happened and were able to connect with him after about 10 minutes and glad he stayed there."
Efficient service,One of the best ways to get around Seoul. Need a while to get used to the train map and know the different train lines you need to change to. Staff were friendly and helpful. However just be prepared to do a lot of walking. 
"Nice metro, need cash to buy ticket","The metro is clean, quiet and efficient. Announcements in Korean and English in addtion to screens that show upcoming stops in both languages (one after the other, not simultaneous) and inform you of which side the doors will open at the next station."
"Very useful, but not the most intuitive system I've encountered","Don't e afraid it's actually not as confusing as you first think. Buying tickets from the machines is actually really easy, better than most cities. The system itself is rather huge. Transferring lines is the norm. What's a little confusing is that each line operates a little differently in directions. Incar schematics are not as up to date or easy to follow as other systems. Not really confusing but not as helpful as it could be. However it was extremely clean, not particularly overcrowded, and always felt safe."
Excellwnt Subway,"We have traveled to many countries on the world and I consider this Subway to the best. Many lines covering a wide area, extremely clean, good signage, helpful employees, and other riders are not rude. "
Very good,The Seoul metro is very good fast and comfortable. Quite busy at the rush hour however it is the fastest way to move around the city.
Efficient and easy to use,"Getting around tourist spots in Seoul and Incheon is easy and cheaper (than taking a taxi). Reloading the tmoney card is easy, reloading machines are located in the stations. Most subway stations have several exits. If you are a tourist, research on the exit that you need to take to get to your destination. Also, avoid the rush hour.Another tourist tip: avoid the rush hour."
Urbanization,"Not used to the cris-crossing of subways, it is not what I used to experience in Hong Kong and Singapore. This is totally different.One mistake can cost you a ton of walk. But in the end it is an efficient and effective means of transportation."
easy,"Buy a money card at the local convenience store and your off! easy to navigate, just watch you don't jump on an express train by accident."
A very efficient mode of transport ,"The Seoul Metro is a great way to get around Seoul. It is economical, efficient, clean and good signage. You need to purchase a T money card which can also be used for other purchases. On leaving the country you can redeem any money left on the card minus a small surcharge.Public toilets always visible at the stations."
Fast & convenient,"The metro system in Seoul is very convenient, and easy to access, all u need is a Tmoney card and the subway apps. Don't worry if u miss a train because the next one will come in only a few minutes. Do mind the exit number of each station because there's several exits and each leads to different places. Wrong exit might cause longer walking distance to the place you're looking for. The underground shopping center is located in every subway station and u can find some good stuff with cheaper price than in the shopping mall"
Must try!,Very good chicken soup. It's worth the price and decent. Many people were there and it was busy so it is a good sign. Don't forget to buy their ginsing wine
Excellent but not as good as Hong Kong or Beijing.,Very good service but lacking the ease of Hong Kong and Beijing Metro for English speaking persons to follow the directions as easily. 
good transportation way and cover most tourist areas,It is good easy and clean. it is can be the best ways for some tourist attractions. Most the trains are crowded but if the air con are work nicely will not be problem. 
One of the best transport system in Asia,"I found Seoul metro system easy to use and very conveniently located at major attractions. What it needs is the tourist pass like Japan that offers daily, 3 days... pass."
Fast and logical to use,"We loved the metro. Trains were frequent. Fares were cheap, most usually 1250won. Transfers to other lines were well signposted. We were very impressed with the whole system. We used it a lot and only spent 30,000 won over 10 days!! "
A little confusing,"Prior to travelling to Korea, we went to Hong Kong. So I couldn't help but compare their Metro system. Though both very convenient, I find Seoul's metro a bit confusing due to lack of English signs or odd placing of signs. Unlike in Hong Kong, everything is right in front of you and its impossible to get lost.Nevertheless, it is still the easiest and cheapest way to travel around."
Best Way To Get Around,"During my year of living in Seoul, I used the Seoul Metro multiple times a week. It is extremely easy to use and navigate. You can purchase a metro card in any convenient store and easily load/reload the card at any station kiosk. They have English available while loading your card to make it easy to understand. The prices are fairly cheap, compared to other major metro stations throughout the world. Each station sign is written in Hangul and in English and the lines are color-coded. You can download a free Seoul Metro map that you can look at offline and see what route you need to take and when to transfer. Some transfers can be a long walk and somewhat confusing, but just follow the signs. The PA system is also in English. Overall, the whole system is very efficient. Be careful of the priority seats and seats in general. You should avoid the priority seating (for elderly & pregnant women) if you are young and healthy. If there is an elderly person standing, you should offer your seat to them, again if you are young and healthy. The trains are spacious, air conditioned/heated and clean."
Very easy to use...,"Just like any other big cities with subways. If u did not buy the T-card, it is easy to buy ticket at the vending kiosk. ( no queues even at peak times) but each time u buy a ticket, there is a deposit of 500 won which is redeemable when u exit station at the deposit refund kiosk. Example,if train fare is 1350 ( basic fare) u need to pay 1850 won into the vending machine. After the ride, u tap the card to exit, proceed to deposit refund machine & it will refund u the 500 won coin."
Train in Korea,It is convenient to go different places by the train however the indication of exit and transfer train is sometime misleading. It would be better indicate to facilitate traveller especially for new tourist like me.The elevator is extremely slow motion when closing which my friend and I thought it has error. It might be adapted by local Korea but it would be too too slow for Hong Kong people
AMAZING TRAVEL METHOD!,"I can only praise the subway service in South Korea. Despite it being my first time in Korea, I felt like a pro. My main savour was an app called Subway Korea. You have to get this. With this app it plans your whole journey easily just by telling it where you're going to be departing from and where you will be arriving. It will then tell you how long it will take, all the stops and lines, how much money it should cost and how long each change will take. It basically tells you everything! The icon is light blue with a picture of a white train so make sure you download the right one. After setting it up with an internet connection you can still look at it without having internet.Korean subway makes your life pretty simple even if you don't have the app. Everything is labelled clearly. The destinations are shown everywhere and the different lines and changes are highlighted. If you feel like you're not 100% sure where your stop is you can follow the signs to something more obvious like Incheon or Seoul and then by walking to that platform you'll be able to find your station. Everything is in English so it helps!They have the line maps on pillars and also on the actual platform so you can check before getting on the subway to make sure you're on the right one. Do this before getting on if you're unsure because once you're on it can get pretty busy and the maps inside aren't that great.If you're on the actual train and its packed and you have no idea where to transfer.....listen out for a little song and tune they play at any station that offers transfers! It's pretty cool.All in all I rate the subway 10/10. I was worried I would get lost but it makes it pretty hard to get lost with so much information.Money wise? - Get a T-Money card. These cost around 5000 won to buy if you don't have one. They're basically like Oyster cards in London. Just top up using the reload machines which are simple and easy to use and offer English instructions. Travel is CHEAP and allows you to go on the subway, bus and shuttle buses. Every time you beep in and out it will tell you how much you have left.Easy!"
Efficient,"Although navigating the train system was a challenge, the service was efficient and convenient for passengers."
Easy to Use,The train service is really cheap and convenient to use. Recommend downloading subway Korea which works offline for easy navigation of the city.
okay,"I think Seoul Metro is okay, pretty cheap and fast. If you are visitors, try to get T money and get krw 100 discount for each trip. Or get a one, two or three days pass (around krw 35K for 3 days if I am not mistaken) for unlimited ride on bus or metro. Not really wort imho. Actually I prefer bus because I will be able to get the real feel of the city while riding the bus and look around the city."
Well working subway system,"The Seoul Metro is an excellent way to get around. It is easy to find the correct stations even for those, who do not speak Korean as all stations are also have signs in English. It is also a very cheap way to travel. I can truly recommend."
Generally effiicient,Need to read both the metro map and each station maps (for exit points) carefully. Generally an efficient transport system.
Transport,"We used the Seoul Metro extensively during our 4 day visit & after a little initial hesitation,found it excellent to travel on.Really cheap - all journeys cost approximately: $1.50 to anywhere on the circuit.It was always on time,clean & the users were very courteous,friendly & helpful when help was required.The only downside to The Metro was - The Stairs & lots of them.Not many Travelators or lifts & when there was a lift it was often in a difficult place to find.A very large system with 15 or more lines,colour coded for easy use.A helpful tip - look not to where you are going so much as looking where the train is actually going - eg : the end I'd the line & work backwards to see your own station.When we were advised to do that,it became very easy to travel on The Metro.Highly recommended when in Seoul"
Easy and most convenient way ,"Seoul Metro seems complicated but when you actually tried it, it's simple. We love that the card dispensing machines have English language. There are directions everywhere so newbies like us are informed."
Touring Cyclists ,"The Seoul Metro is the four largest people mover in the world, with 5.2 million travellers everyday. It is inexpensive and the most connected and well organized public transport system that I have ever had the pleasure of riding."
Fast and best transportation ,You can beat all the traffic in Seoul the subway is connected with every corner of Seoul. They don't have a day pass. 
Fast and reliable transport,We used the train a lot during our trip. The train are fast and on time. The maps are easy to understand and some stations have big underground shopping.
Great way to get sround,Stops are very well marked and easy to read. We had no issues getting around though we had never been to Seoul before. It was also a very economical way to get around
Excellent Metro System,"Easy to use, with signage in English. Clean and inexpensive. You can get anywhere in Seoul in a reasonable time. Auto traffic is very congested and you can get stuck in traffic for long periods of time. Be cautious about using express trains during rush hours. Very crowded."
Fastest way around Seoul,The Seoul Metro is the fastest way around Seoul. I recommend purchasing the T-Money card from the With Me convenience stores. Before going through the turnstyles to the subway find a ticket machine and load your card with 20000 won. That should last you a week. The T-Money card is also good to use on buses and taxis. 
Best ,It is quite good metro service. There have many T-Money Card but the T-Money Card can't sense anything if your wallet have other card like Libra cards 
Good ,"The metro is really good in Seoul. You can go anywhere with it. And it's on time most of the time. It can get crowded around 5-6:00 pm. It's also easy to use. Everything is written in English (and korean,Chinese and Japanese)."
Clean and very convenient,"The Seoul metro is clean and modern. It is convenient and there are many indications. The majority of messages are translated into English, Japanese and Chinese."
Best way to explore Seoul,"Seoul Metro have many lines but the map is easy to readmost station have clear signage for transfer and exithow to read the map is easy, U just need to see what is the last station name from the line that u wish to take, for example u are taking line 5 (purple line) u stay at euljiro ga 4 station and u need to go to gwanghwamun. U just see the last station of line 5 with direction to gwanghwamun name banghwa station, so when u are going to transfer u just need to read the signage line 5 banghwa line. you just follow the signage banghwa line will lead you to the right station you are heading to. Map it self u can download from google.Most station have a lot of stairs to climbescalator not really much availableTransfer to other line require a lot of walkso if u are travelling with elders, pls make sure to take care even they have elevator for elder and disable people but still need hard work to queing and walkingWifi mostly available free at metro stationmetro cost mostly KRW 1.250/tripbut when i take metro before 7 am, i'm just paying KRW 1.000metro card u may purchase at convenient store such as GS 25, CU, Seveneleven or at ticket machineI purchase one from CU with character card cost KRW 3.000, normal card cost KRW 2.500u also can top up thereTrain clean, they also have announcement by korean, english and chinesesome metro station have cosmetic shop, bread shop, convenient store etcoverall taking metro is a good way to explore seoul because they have a lot of station and a lot of exit gate which convenient near tourist attractionPS: really not recommed if u are bring big luggage from airport use metro remember a lot of walk, people and stairsso better take bus from airport to hoteleven cost more but bus really convenient and luxury. I'm searching through website which bus limousine will pass by my hotel, lucky it stop in front if my hotel lobby ^^"
Very quick doors,The subway is very efficient! Be aware that the doors only give you about 10 seconds to get on and off. Our son wasn't quick enough and got left behind at a stop! 
A great way to navigate Seoul,"We use the metro to get around the city. Rarely, if ever, do we take a taxi or bus. Signs are easy to read and are generally in both Korean and English."
A convenient way to travel around the city,Seoul Metro network was very wide with totally 20 different lines. It was very convenient for us to travel around the city as all lines were well connected with tourist destinations and shopping districts as well.
Get a t-money card,So easy and convenient to use the t-money card. A few times it took several attempts for the machines to read the card but it eventually worked. Try and stay away during rush hour (crush hour). Expect to be pushed and jostled when it's busy. Download the Kakao metro app and you will have no problem knowing what train to get on etc... 
A cost effective way to travel around Seoul,"The Seoul Metro network can be confusing at first. However, once you understand it, it is a convenient and cheap way to get around Seoul. The trains are very efficient and you only need to wait a short while for the trains to arrive."
Very extensive metro,This will take you anywhere and everywhere you need to go in Seoul. Lots of walking stairs escalators between stops so recommend being in good health ! They say people are pushy but we have not experienced that. Mostly people are very polite. Rush hour is nuts but to be honest it always seems kind of busy on the metro which does make sense in such a huge city!
nice,nice I do recommend to visit this place. I will visit it again when I will back to Seoul.I love to be here again and will be happy to visit it once more.
An experience,"If you have ever been on the subway in New York or the tube in London you may think you know what a crowded car can feel like. Not exactly, ridding the metro at certain times can be so cramped that you may never get off in time at your stop for first timers. Saying this though it is a marvel and so very helpful to get you around such a crowded city. Have patients, and if you ""need"" your personal space then don't ride the metro."
Great service ,Being solo on my trip to South Korea I was a little nervous getting around place to place however the subway and trains are fairly easy to use and they are speak English as well. Don't be afraid to use it when you come for a visit. 
Convenient & User-friendly,Use T-Money card which you can re-load and later refund remaining amount at the airport's convenient store prior to departure.
Easy easy,You buy a card you locate the line and you go very easy to use and to find his way! A must do to go to each site!
Best way to get around use a T card ,"Confusing at first, but down loaded the Seoul Metro app and it all makes sense,places on the metro are not that far apart above ground so you can never be really ""Lost"""
No Need for Taxi's - Excellent...,"This should be one of Korea's proudest achievements, it is one of the best subway services I have used. Excellent."
 Highly reliable ,"The best mode of transportation in Seoul. It is clean, affordable, and safe. It's network is extensive and will get you to places you need to get to. "
The most efficient subway that I know ,"The Korea subway is very efficient (just like his bus) you can go to anywhere with a cheap fare(₩1,250 ~ ₩1,750) You MUST get a card (T Money) on a CU, GS25 or 7/11 and recharge at least ₩10,000 so you can travel several times without any problem. The subway is very precise. If it says that arrives 12:35, it arrives 12:35. You also should download kakao metro and kakao maps, this apps let you know the real timetables of the subway as also the fastest way to go through the subway. Also they told you shock platform do you need to take and even if you get our of the sub on the left or the right. The only problem with the subway us that sometimes it's very confusing when you need to change the sub on the same lane because one lane has several ways and can be a little confusing. "
Great mode of transportation ,"Best way to get around especially avoiding traffic, tolls, and cost effective. Metro system is user friendly regardless of your nationality. They have three different types of trains, Korail (regular metro) the SRT (super rapid transit) and the KTX (we know as the bullet train). Absolutely the best way to see Korea regardless of your destination within the country. "
Clean and easy to use,"The system works properly, signs and anouncements are in English. T-Moneycards are availlable at each station. You have to scan when you enter and when you leave. Compared to frankfurt cheap and clean!!! Maps are too small, therefore hard to read."
Great ,Used the metro once and it was very efficient and clean. The machines where you get your tickets from have English button so that was helpful. Very much set out like English metro but much bigger !!
Need a lot of improvement.,The stations with hit and misses. Some stations need more info and need TLC. Some stations lack of info and signage and disable access. The escalator do not allow stroller but has no lift.
Easy and cheap,One of the easiest metro systems I've experienced. It's cheap and not too crowded. Stops are at convenient places and close to tourist attractions.
Easiest most affordable way to travel Seoul ,"At first I was a bit intimidated by Seoul Metro. But when you actually take your time and read the signs EVERYTHING IS IN ENGLISH as well as Korean. So be not afraid. Once you read and follow the signs and directions you will be completely fine. The subway cars are extremely spacious and clean. Beware of rush hour times (7am-9am & 5pm-7pm) the trains are extremely packed. You do have to buy a T- money card. There are machines in the station, it cost 3,000 won to get and then you can load as much as you want, to take you anywhere you want to go. You can not load the card using US currency (I've tried) and you also cannot use the same card back to back (I've tried). So everyone has to have their own individual card. "
Awesome system,I rather take the subway then wait in heavy car traffic... This system is so awesomely fast! Takes you everywhere:) cheap and chic!Wish we have as many lines in our home city.
Wonderful Subway System,"Would highly recommend travellers to access all spots in Seoul using the subway instead of other means of public transport, primarily because the subway network is indeed very comprehensive and information is readily available in English within the station and trains. Travellers are able to eat within the train and station, but somehow the trains and stations have been able to maintain a high sense of cleanliness. There are also many shops selling things from food, to clothes and other personal items within many of the stations. So in itself, you could say the subway station is also a tourist attraction; a place to visit and shop around for cheap and good stuff.What might be the only real concern is that the stations are huge and not all stations have elevators. The lifts may also be packed during peak hour travel. Hence, for those with mobility or problems with walking stairs or long distances, it might pose some challenge. It's nevertheless an excellent way to travel around Seoul and even out of the city."
Excellent train service,Excellent train service that connects to interesting places in the city. Information desk is very helpful and provide useful information for tourists like me.
"Must do, fast, clean and efficient","Its clean, cheap and user friendly. Has toilets etc and does not stink like London , Paris, clean like Asian countries. Fares are decent, refund deposit at exit and machines in 4 languages."
Stay away during the morning hours,"It works and gets you nearly anywhere in Seoul, but please please stay away during the morning hours. Every cart is packed and people are rushing to work and pushing around. It's a fun to see once, but not 5 times a week."
Excellent ,"We were commuting on our four day trip through the subway. They are easily accessible , clean and fastest way of commuting around Seoul . Lots of shopping and food outlets in and around all the metros. It is very safe and the best way to commute with your T-Money card."
Outstanding travel throughout Seoul,"The subway in Seoul is just unbelievable. It's quick, easy, convenient and it's easy to learn and use. The new pay by card is so easy, just buy at any convenience store, load the money and you are ready to go. You can use it for the subway, bus, taxi and even food at certain locations. The trains come so often, there is never any reason to be late for anything and the Korean people will happily help you with directions. Loved it!! I wish California had this system."
"Easy, safe and fast!","Totally recomended, easy accessable and most economical way to travel. One of the cleanest and safest that I experienced! "
Easy to use,"Very easy to understand. There's english translation in every station, very clean and considering its public transportation, no unpleasant smell."
Seoul Metro Subway,"If this is not the best subway system in the world, I'd like to see what is. It is the most user-friendly in terms of ease of use and availability of stations. If you need to travel within Seoul, the Metro is the way to go. Instructions in Korean and English."
Friendly to foreigners,"It is easy to go around the area and understand the route of the trains, as English translation is always available. The staff knows how to speak English as well. Stores, shops and restaurants are always present in the stops, making it more convenient."
"Clean, Convenient and Affordable fare","As many people say, collectively called, Seoul metro, has its prowess in clean, convenient environment and reasonable fare price. Operated by mainly two city-owned and one government owned public corporation, it is easily accessible from everywhere in metro Seoul with facilities for nursing, the aged and the physically challenged. In addition, fare is almost half of Tokyo metro.Be aware that newer lines such as line 5-8 and 9 has better environment in terms of air conditioning/heating, silence, WiFi access, radio reception, escalator/elevator, etc."
Excellent,Don't forget to collect your 500 won at the end of your trip! Metro is clean and very efficient...just pay attention so you get off at the right stop. 
Deserves number 1,"How did they even do it? A Metro system that makes so much sense and is so easy in such a big city! Awesome! Best Transportation system I've ever seen. Don't worry before you go to Seoul, it's really easy to understand and all exits are shown (eg Anguk Station, Insadong exit 6 etc). Lines 2,6 and 3 are probably the major lines. So maybe try to stay near those lines. I stayed at Hongik University (line 2) and it was easy for me to get around."
"Efficient metro, remember to get refund","The metro really helps you to get around Seoul and is not particular expensive. Around 2000 won per person to travel within zone 1 (and if you return the paper card to one of the machines in the station called ""deposit refund"" after you have travelled then you get 500 won back).Be wary if you travel late at night or before 6am as the metro does not always run. They also have special pink seats reserved for the elderly and disabled etc. So do offer these seats to those entitled to sit there! :)"
Convenient,"The Metro in Seoul covers most tourist spots. It is easy to ride. Especially for those who are travel alone or go to remote area, the price is comparatively cheaper than a taxi although taxi in Seoul is not expensive.Special attention should be paid when transit to another line is required. Moreover, sometimes there is no English stop name shown on the directional panel inside the car, therefore pay attention to your destination if it is approaching."
"Clean, safe and efficient! ","We travelled all over Seoul via Metro. Cheap and easy! Love the tunes for each line. Always spotlessly clean. Safe at all times of the day. Always on time, always! (Western countries should learn!)"
Excellent train system ,"It was a bit overwhelming initially trying to understand the Seoul metro but after a few times using it you will get a hang of it. Signs are very clear and easy to understand. There are 9 lines and each line has a colour. Train floor, station, boards are all in the colour of the line. It's good to know which exit you need to get out from if you have a certain place to go to. If you're traveling with a child and brought your stroller, my advice will be just to leave it in your hotel room. Use a baby carrier instead. There are lifts but it's hard to find and not at all exits. You'll be climbing lots of stairs. Used an app called Subway by Malang which was really useful in working out which lines and stations, can be used offline. "
Outstanding service!,"Clean, punctual (98%), exceptionally spacious, wifi connection throughout, heated in winter and A/C in summer, English language translation for stations and directions and verbal notification for next station, very very good value for money. "
Very Reliable,I visited Seoul as a tourist and stayed there for a week. I depended fully on Seoul Metro subway transportation system. The map and the route were easy to understand and ticket vending machines were available in every station. The stations were clean and neat. Really convenient.
Best rated subway system in the world,"Clean, safe, on time, cheap, easy to navigate and covers the city. What's not to love? Good navigation apps available as well. "
Metro works perfectly,Metro works perfectly and it is more crowded than Busan metro. To use was simple. Prices only a bit higher that Busan. Ticket refund card ( 500 Won when return) was clever as long you noticed separate machine near outside exit passes.
Metro,"The high speed metro works very well, we used it many times to get around purchase the pass it will save you money"
"Clean, fast, convenient metro system!","The metro in Seoul is very convenient as you can access almost any part of the city for one low price. The metro even goes to the airport which is great. It's very clean and quiet. There are many great apps which allow you to see what doors to get on and off at in order to transfer most efficiently. There are screens that indicate where the next subway car is and how long it will take to get to your station. The announcements for each stop are usually in several languages including Korean, English, Mandarin and Japanese. During rush hours, it can be EXTREMELY crowded, which is a huge con for me as I don't like crowds. Overall, I love the Seoul metro."
First Time in Seoul,"I am amazed by the subway system. You can get EVERYWHERE in Seoul it seems. I had trouble because I was by myself, I speak no Korean, but if I somehow found my way around Seoul (and I get lost EVERYWHERE) then I must say it's a great subway system. Trains are modern and smooth ride and you never have to wait long. It's always crowded no matter what time of day, but Seoul is a huge busy very populated city so what can you expect. "
Good But Bad For Old People,"I Use Seoul Metro to go to almost everywhere, but not every station have elevator / escalator to go to upstairs. So if you go to South Korea - Seoul with old people better use bus or taxi"
Easy to use and convenient,"Don't be put off by how complicated the seoul metro map looks. It is easy to navigate and with a bit of route planning, you will get to your destination without hassle. Just take note of which direction you should be heading and once you alight, which exits you should take to (each station usually has several exits and denoted in numeric). Tap your t-money card once to enter and again another time to exit. Transfers are free. I highly recommend the app called ""Subway Korea"" (a white train with yellow background) that you can download from Apps Store/Play store. It is in English (station names are provided in Hangeul as well) and you are able to use it for route planning and it gives excellent info about fare, how many stations, which station to alight/transfer, duration of journey, etc."
Vacation,10+ stays here and still totally satisfied. Friends and family have also been impressed with personal hospitality.
Seoul has wonderful metro service,Don't fear trying to use Seoul's metro service. Ask your hotel staff for help. You'll be surprised how easy it is to use and how many places it goes in the city.
Efficent and easy to navigate.,This is a great mode of transport and I had not trouble reaching my destinations quickly and efficiently. Terrific. 
Efficient Train System,"Very efficient. There were English signs, including the ticket machines, that can be really helpful to tourists. Also, the restrooms were clean with toilet paper; can definitely attest to that after a case of food intolerance on the way back to our hotel -- I know TMI, but hey, thats important to know as a traveler!!! :-)"
Efficient,"Maps have English and Korean which helps. Once you have your head around it it is easy to use. Staff at stations have been really helpful, particularly at the information counter or office. I had them print maps and directions for mr which was fabulous. Buy a card at convenience store and load money on then tap on and off. Or you can get single journey tickets. Not overly cheap or expensive. Not wheelchair friendly at all.... lots of stairs everywhere. I was in a moon boot and struggled with some of the line changes- long walks up and down. Trains run very regularly. Efficient and clean. "
"Clean, easy to navigate, but crowded","Having used subway systems in Hong Kong, Shanghai, Beijing and now Seoul in the past year, I can say that Seoul's system is one of the better ones. Signs are in English as well as Hangul so you shouldn't get lost. If you are going to use it more than once, buy yourself a T-money (stored value) card at one of the dispensing machines near the entrance. You can recharge it there or at 7-Elevens. Lots of people use this system so it can get quite crowded at times. "
"English directions clearly stated in stations, but can get confusing trying to change trains at the different interchanges","Efficient and clean metro system, with English, Chinese and metro announcements stating the station names. There are clear English directions all around the stations too and even a sliver guide (referring to elderly volunteers) at each station who can help if you are lost. The transfers to different metro lines can get confusing sometimes, with long walks and stairs to each interchange. Other than that, their toilets are very clean too! The ticketing machines have English instructions if you need to purchase tickets, but I would suggest to purchase a T-money card at any convenience store that bears the T-money logo if you are travelling around using the metro. Transfers and rides are discounted using the card and it can be used in major cities listed on their website. Just need to purchase the card and top up at any of the ticketing machine at any stations and you are good to go! They can even be used for purchases at some of the convenience stores."
Efficient!,"This subway system is clean and efficient. For a small fee, one can travel everywhere. Love the music as the train enters the station and when the ticket is placed in the turnstile."
Much like other metro systems,"Much like any other metro systems in big cities- easy, clean and affordable. You can buy tickets at the vending machines- I've had some problems when paying with coins so I'd recommend paying with bills. Transferring between stations can take some time compared to other places like Taipei- and the screens don't show when the train is actually arriving and departing (something I find annoying)."
cheap and helpful,"the metro is very helpful to get around the city on a budget. it is also faster than a taxi in many cases. you can take it to or from the city to the airport on a budget as well. the english on the trains isnt great but with a good map of the entire system, it is very easy to use. be aware gogole maps does not work in the ROK so you will get lost from time to time between destinations. "
"Good system, that brings you to almost every interesting place you like to go.",The interchange station is very confusing sometime and alot of staircase to climb. Better to get a metro map first and study it first b4 you set out. 
Efficient transportation,"I found using the Seoul Subway system to be efficient, safe, super organized and very clean. There is an app for use on smartphones that helps with the fastest or easiest route. I never got lost and never felt unsafe. I highly recommend the Seoul Subway!"
fastest way to travel around seoul,"pros: - fastest way to travel seoul- they have english translation for every station- some staff can speak and read english. while some dont. its better to keep both english and traditional korean language for your destination- they care for blind people. theres a special tiles with texture and color especially made for blind people around the metro areas - there are toilet within most train station- if you want to use metro for more than one day its a good idea to buy a purple card (sorry i forgot the name). you simply top up the balance and can be refunded later. it save your time- children under 5 is freecons:- prepare to walk through many stairs! theres not many escalator available! while lift only strictly allowed only for elder people, people with disability and family with young kids- the map can be confusing with so many destinations! its better to get the metro map (ask your hotel staff they might have one or research from google) and make a plan for your destination - the experience of entering the metro train can be dangerous one! once i saw a boy whos feet got stuck on the train door. while everybody try to force open the door. luckily his foot not badly hurt. then i got separate with my wife because the door suddenly closed! if you bring young kids or elder people please be careful when entering the train especially when they put signal and announcement.- if you travel with 4 person sometimes the metro fare is the same cost for using one taxi. it depends on your destination"
So easy,"Bit daunting once you arrive from the airport but the 3rd and successive uses you become more familiar with it. Suggest CityMapper app as an assist but it's very intuitive. Jingles tell you arrival and station approach. Announcements also in English. Get a metro card and preload/load it with cash value at english-""speaking"" machines. Card also accepted on buses. This is our 2nd week traversing Seoul very happily"
Travelers ,"Yes for me it's nice when I came to Seoul there is two airports one gimpo which is close and the other one is Inchon.You can take the taxi but if you came in the rash time ...will take long time go to the city ,You can take the train express and less then one h ..you are in the city .Easy to understand...offcouse you don't need the Korean characters...they have in English to"
Must ride,"Seoul metro is very nice, clean, spacious, easy to use. Just get yourself Tmoney card and start riding.The most amusing part is train arrival, you gotta go to find out what is is :)"
Great way of transportation,"The Seoul metro has a vast network that is however easy to understand from the numerous maps. Finding your way is very easy as everything is marked and pointed out clearly. Get a chip-card for easy traveling, also valid on the bus."
"Simple, efficient and cheap","As explained in my DMZ review. Most of mundane journey in Seoul was spent alone. So when travelling to the different attractions and monuments, the subway was how I travelled. I purchased a T-Money card from a Seoul Station convenience store and loaded it up. The maps are very easy to read. Letting know know what the next stop is and what the last stop was when you are about to enter the train. I used an app called subway Korea. Which was very handy. You search the station you are departing and arriving from and it shows you the transfer stops and how much approximately it will cost to travel. Most one way trips cost around 1,400. With around 2,000 from one end of the map to the other. It's very reasonable for getting from A to B. The trains can get very crowded so be causious if carrying around luggage, but I would highly recommend the metro being your mode of transport."
Fast & Efficient ,"As titled, we saved about $100 USD Airport to City using this instead of uber/taxi and saved hours using this instead of bus. The Metro is quick and stops at most places you would need to go. Easy to read signs and good announcements on and off the train. "
A Good Way To Get Around the City,"I love walking around cities but I found the Seoul Metro to be one of the quickest and most convenient ways to travel longer distances. It is efficient and fairly cheap especially if you pay 3000 Won for a touch and go T-Money Card - similar to London's Oyster card system that allows you to travel on the subway, buses and taxis."
Easy to get Around,"Coming from a city 6 times the size of Seoul, I think that Seoul has 6 times the number of lines and stops as Beijing and tickets are under $1. Very convenient!"
Wonderful System,"Recently I have been on the Metro systems in London, Hong Kong, Tokyo, Shanghai and Toronto, this one is Seoul is equal to, if not better than them all. It is easy to use, and is well laid out and clean.Buy the Metro card, throw 25000 won on it and go travel around Seoul. Don't be frightened, it is simple to use, plan your route before hand, and just go, if you make a mistake, back track, and try again."
Easy and cheap way to get around Seoul,"No problem to buy and top up a card using a machine. The machines have english menus, and all stations are clearly marked in English under their Korean names. If you are finding it hard to plan trips, get the free Seoul metro route and map app for your phone. It works offline"
crowded seems Seoul people travel in metro only,"Seoul is best connected by metro , all markets are connected and good to see you can by lots of cloths from these markets for winter season"
Super efficent,Don't forget to get reimbursed for your single ride tickets at the machines near the turntiles. You'll get KRW500 back! Love it!
Very easy and travel friendly ,Is very easy to travel in Seoul. Everything is in english too and you will see is easier than you think.They don't have bins so make sure you take your rubbish with you.. is very clean and organize.
Convenient...,"Budget conscious travellers like us used T-Card bought at Incheon Airport. Which can be use for buses, train rides and taxis throughout the holiday. Travelled by buses, we see alot more and alight when we want to and every spot is a surprise and we didnt even realised that we had arrived at Gangnam District, a big wow! Do expect the Korean to be rough, rather rough and loud...not as bad as the Chinese but rough..!"
"Clean, efficient and fast","Seoul has one of the best Metro-system I have ever seen. The trains are very clean, you do not have to wait long for a train and you get to every hotspot of the city very quick. Furthermore the fare is rather cheap and the ticketing system is very easy to understand"
The best public transport ,"Subway is the best way for transportation. There is no need to know English or Korean to use Seoul Metro, just to have a map. Tickets prise is not high. "
Our Holiday Seoul,Stayed in Seoul Korea for 5 days and was blow away by the infra structure with the Metro system . Move 8 million per day with precision and speed. Had to get travel card which is very reasonable and topped up to use on the metro trains. Cheapest transport and able to go any where in the city with ease. Excellent way to get around and stations are close by . Great part that the cards can be used next visit :)
Mr.Rachai Methavichit,Very convenient but needed to installed more escalators for the elderly. I believed that there must be about 6-8 Mrt. Lines in Seoul.
Great way to travel!,"A cheap way to travel, very punctual and everywhere was very clean. Would recommend getting a POP card for ease."
Very efficient ,A very efficient and easy to use metro system. . If u have used metro before in other countries. . This is very easy compared to other countries. . The prices are less than half of the taxi and if u are a solo traveller then metro becomes super cheap. .Highly recommend using it for areas accessible by metro.. 
Clean and prompt,Only drawbacks are it can get VERY crowded at rush hour and it doesn't operate 24 hours. Most of the time it definitely beats surface traffic.
one of the best,"absolutely good working Metro. very punctual, clean and useful. make sure to get the t-money card. thanks"
A first-class subway,"While traveling in Seoul, the metro is the best way to travel. It is fast, very clean, and super safe."
Business trip travel mood,So you get a subway card and add money to it and the city is yours. You are open to buses and subways to get to any place in the city. Maps are at every stop and trains and buses stop often. The best part is the subway is very clean!
Best way to travel in Seoul,"There are some that have written that the Seoul Metro is confusing, but I would say otherwise. There are apps for subway for both iPhone and Android that show you exactly which line to take, where to transfer, how long it will take, and how much it will cost. Just search for Seoul Subway. The metro is punctual and convenient. In some areas the stations are combined with the KTX so you can go outside of the Seoul area. If you don't have cell service, don't worry. The metro has free Wi-Fi to use your subway app. The Metro is not just for traveling either. Some of the best shopping in Seoul is underground in the stations. You can find most anything as well as even grab a quick bite to eat along the way."
Well connected yet complex ,Metro is well connected to all major areas on the city yet for new comers it's confusing to interchange and find right exits. After 1-2 days of using metro I was comfortable. Please note it's difficult to travel with kids or infants especially if you cannot climb lengthy stair cases as escalators and lifts are not always present. However it feels good to travel in metro and feel like a local. 
Best Way to Go Around Seoul,"Efficient, Cheap, Punctual and Amazing. i would have rated it excellent if not for the fact that there are many stations without any escalators. when you're carrying luggage and dead tired from walking around; an escalator is a like an oasis in the dessert"
Easy way around Seoul,"We have tried the subway in Japan and got lost, we did not had this problem at Seoul subway it is very easy to understand actually at the end of your day you cam recycle your card and you will get 5 won back for each one. We had the luck of this girl who help us with that. It was great."
Convenient travel but a bit confusing,"I was a bit concerned before my trip to Korea as my friend told me I would be exploring solo without her most of the time. She also lives at the edge of Seoul, which means I had to transfer from another commuter line to Metro. It was bit confusing at first; to figure things out. The different metro lines and transfer points are easy enough to understand. Although the signs are also in English, you definitely need to be aware of your destination's final station name; to make sure you're going the right direction. I found that platform structure can be difficult for foreigners to navigate at first. I ended up on the wrong side the first few days; and had to double back up and down/ or down and up the stairs and around to the opposite side.After arriving in Thailand after Korea visit, I realize that the platform design matters. The SkyTrain (monorail) as well as subway system in Bangkok have only one platform, just like in Japan. You just have to read the sign whether you need to be on the left/ or the right side. The signs are also very clear which direction you are going. Although it is affordable and convenient, it can be confusing for a short-term visitors. I was hoping for a metro map for foreigner but did not find any available."
Clean and economical....,"Clean, economical method to explore Seoul. It covers all most all attraction in Seoul. English friendly. Best way to travel is buying a t-mobile card. Can easily top up it and get cash back. "
Reasonable and good transport,"Make sure to buy a T card and top up value for your usage of the Metro. Very well maintain, and can go anywhere in Seoul. Quite complication for new travellers so make sure to check your destination station and its color code. "
Little difficult,You have to download the subway application in your mobile and try to use it to now how it's work. One thing more good in Seoul metro that is the station name writing in English with Korean.
Metro System is so Clean and easy to use,"I love the fact that the metro was easy to use. I would recommend that you buy a Tmoney card and load it up because it can use it for the subway, taxis and buses. So worth the 3 dollar deposit! Also, note that their is a easy to use Subway App that helps you get from point a to point b. "
Good Metro System,"Good metro system, ETA of train is accurate, and go download their metro apps, the ETA in the apps is very accurate as well, so you can plan your journey well.From time to time (most probably due to maintenance), they will announce the next stop is the last stop, while it is definitely not the last station in the map.... Have no choice but step out from the train, and wait for the next one. Really pissed me off especially when I was in hurry, such as catching my flights, lolBut generally, its good."
come for the music stay for the ride,Best subway system we have ever experienced. It is amazingly easy and convenient. When the subway is at a transfer station this wonderful music plays. And everything is said in English in addition to Korean making it easy to know where you are going.
Awesome except for the forks,"The subway system in Seoul is amazing. It is clean cheap and expansive. Just beware of the forks on some lines. For example, you could be online one and hit a fork in the road and easily end up going to the wrong location. Not really a problem if you're using a app and paying attention though. "
Metro system,"I took the the fast track from airport to my hotel, fast and quiet, very efficient . Take you right to the downtown , only cost us Korea kw 8000.00"
One of the best metro connecting various part of the city,Seoul metro is renowned for its cris cross networks of underground rail which make commuting so easy and less time consuming.It has nearly seven networks and transferring to each network you can explore the whole city 
terbaik,"cara yang paling senang untuk berjalan di seluruh seaoul. at first, you will be confuse with all the exit and route, but just go with it. you will learn it after 2-3 times ride it and find an exit for it. just study the map for metro and read the sign for the exit, you will be pro in no time. very convenient!!"
Accessible ,Easy to find location by using colour and numbers to find subway line 1-9. Better to download Subway map app to search location than paper map. Subway stations have toilets and clean. Use T-money card to add value $ and machines provide multi-languages.
Using the subway trains ,"As my wife and I are on a six day visit to Seoul , we felt that we should also try a ride on the subway trains.I was at first pretty apprehensive as we do not speak Korean at all. We had taken a cab to Dongdaemun District for my wife to do some shopping and after that we decided to try the subway .It turned out to be a breeze as we are familiar with how subways work . We went to the ticket vending machine and selected our destination station which was Myeongdong station just three stops away. The vending machine accepts both notes and coin. On the train itself, before every stop the signs of the approaching station will show the name of the station in both Korean and English so that made things easier for us .Upon exiting the train, there are signages displayed in English for the various exit points which makes it easy for us English speaking visitors. The ride only cost us 1,300 won each which is much cheaper than going by cab and it is definitely much faster too .I highly recommend the subway for visitors. By the way Seoul is served by 10 lines , each is identified by a different color code and numbered 1 to 10."
Great subway,The best way to get around town is the Metro. Very inexpensive and easy to use. We went all over the place with teenagers and had no problems.
Easy and Fast Transportation,"First come to Korea, subway is my first choice to travelling. It's really easy to understand and really fast. You have to know your destination first, and browse it through internet, and you will know where to go. Then see the subway map, and you will know where to transfer, etc. Don't forget to install Subway Korea mobile applications. The app could tell you the first and last train, and also the fastest route (including transfering, etc.)"
Sun, Easy to find and travel. Download the train and subway app before you go. Most people speaks English so it is easy to get around 
Like always the best way to Travel.,"Clean , on time , tourist friendly and takes you to every part of Seoul. You can buy the Seoul pass and journey 20 times for free in one day amount other advantages of this pass exclusively for foreign travellers."
Undergound,"Using the underground could seem daunting to first time visitors to the city, but after studying where you need to go and looking at which number line you require its easy to work it out, stations are in Korean & English, and so many people are willing to help with directions. safe & clean & relaible service."
Fast and Efficient,It was our first time in Korea. Roaming around Seoul and taking subway trains that is very efficient is the most comfortable and cheap way to travel and see places in Korea. Just a tip though; avoid rush hours am and pm ( 7 to 9 am and 5 to 7 pm). Koreans are nice people during peak hours at train stations can be quite an experience. I get bumped and pushed by locals a lot of times and they never say sorry. I guess it's a normal thing to them. Ha ha.
Best transportation method in Seoul,"Seoul metro is very punctual. Considering the heavy traffic in Seoul, Seoul metro is the only reliable option if you are pressed for the time. Plus, the fare is not expensive."
Fun! Easy! And easy and fun to get lost!,The songs announcing the arrival of the subway will forever be engraved in my mind. So impressive and fun to ride!
"super clean, well organized, easy to use",This is one of the cleanest subway systems in the world. The card can be inserted and easily registered to the station you are going to.
The best way to move around the city,Seoul has an amazing metro system that allows you to get wherever you want. Don´t forget to refund your metro ticket to get your ‎₩500 back.
One of the best metros in the world,"Efficent, fast and clean, I consider this tube system as one of the best I've been, only comparable to the ones in Madrid and Tokyo."
"Easy to use, clean and a fantastic way to get aorund Seoul","One of the best Metro systems in the world. Get one of the apps to navigate easily. Subways do not run into the early morning, and can get crowed at the morning and evening rush hours, but very convenient way to get around Seould and surrounding cities."
very pratical and cheap,love Seoul subway system. Very pratical and unexpensive. And easy to access. Wish my home town subway is that good...:-(
Great Travel Option,"Very clean and efficient service. We felt totally safe even with an 11yr old. It was efficient and once we got a local to assist us but cards for the trip, we did fine. I have to say the people of Seoul are some of the most friendly and helpful people I've met in travelling the world. Not a lot of English speakers, but they try to help anyway! Awesome! Navigating the system and crossovers is a bit confusing if you don't speak the language, some things are in English which helps but as with moat complex subway systems you have to pay attention to the line you are on and what direction you are heading. We had to change lines 3 times and cross over once more as the particular train stopped. It was a fun experience, but for just a few dollars more 2-3 times more, we got a taxi on the way back to the hotel."
"Easy, convenient and gets you to most places faster than any other option","Was a little overwhelmed before I arrived, after all, so many stations, so many lines. When I got to using it, the experience was comfortable and really very easy to navigate. Except for a few lines where changing trains can be tricky, it was a walk in the park. "
Clean and Nice Train,"The train is very clean and nice, there is the seat for old guys and wheel chair.The LED display and sound for next station and destination in english too, very helpful for tourist"
"Affordable, efficient, expansive","Regardless of which corner of Seoul you hope to reach the trains will likely provide the cheapest and most expeditious method of getting there. Much cheaper than Tokyo's trains, Seoul's various (two, primarily, competing companies if I remember correctly) lines will get you there. I lived outside of Seoul in Goyang-Si and never struggled to find an easy, efficient route to any corner of Seoul. The trains were almost always quite clean, though they could get terribly crowded, which isn't exactly unusual or surprising to any travellers familiar with Japan or Hong Kong's trains. Fact is, many people live in the suburbs regardless of what country you visit, and there are going to be rush hours as everyone tries to find their way in to work, and if you avoid those peak transit hours you'll find much more ample seating available. I dealt with a modicum of grumpy/drunk ahjeosshi/ahjumma on the trains, but aside from a rare elbow to the butt or ribcage my daily commute was rarely ever terribly uncomfortable. Shoving was unavoidable, and sometimes annoying, but when you've got a huge percentage of the population utilizing the same train line to get into the city proper, you can't really be surprised at such things. "
Fast public transport with good english signage,The system is fairly easy to navigate with English signage but the different linkways can make it confusing at times. The english announcements at each stop is very helpful though!
Very efficient,Easy to use and access. Trains run on a regular basis and is definitely a good option to taxis when the is so much traffic on the roads. 
Too good and easy to understand,One of the best i have seen so far. safe and fast. Best way to go around seoul. Try it without fear. Self guided.
The best why to travel and see ALL Seoul and Korea,"Half of the S. Korea polulation live in and around Seoul. So, as you can imagine, driving is not the best option. However, you can go anywhere with the metro and bus system attached to the metro....the same goes for ALL S. Korea."
Clear English signage and clean bathrooms in every station,My favorite transportation means though for people in Hong Kong may find train schedule is not as frequent and the walking time inside the station is kind of long but that's because their stations are much larger.Bathrooms are located before and after getting through the gates. Clear signage to find them.I use T-Money card instead of buying tickets each time. You can buy and top them up in convenient stores besides in the stations. The only drawback is that you can't get the card deposit back. 
Seoul Metro,My first time in my life using the subway was in my visit to Seoul. I was a little scared because I thought it would be a disaster trying to get around Seoul. To my surprised i learned that this subway system was so easy to navigate. The network is excellent. The signs are very simple and easy to understand. There are maps in multiple languages for everyone's convenience. Almost every subway stop has shopping stores. I also have a T-money card (transportation card) which is very easy to reload at the devices inside subway stations.
Perfect timing... EVERYTIME!,"This is by far the easiest way to get around town! You can also download apps that make navigating the spaghetti maze of tracks and stations a great deal easier. Check out Subway Korea or KakaoMetro. Fast, comfortable, reliable and convenient. I just wish it ran 24/7 "
"Safe, reasonable, easy to use","Safe, reasonable and easy to use. The only thing is there are too many station, so the map is very small, specially the English or Chinese are very tidy, you better have a map on yr hand or phone.It also happen to me that in the map a route look like it was shorter, but when I ask the information, they recommend another route as mine is longer."
Not bad,The metro in seoul get to almost everywhere and is easy to use. The only problems it's that it close rely early and some tienes it's pretty crowded. Open hours: 05:30-12 (depends of the station and where are you going it could be earlier or later)Crowded hours: -dinner time 18:00-19:00.
 Best metro ever ,"I been almost every where in the world and I can say that in Seoul they got the best metro line ever, fast and can connect almost everywhere in the city..."
Easy and convenient,"It's easy to take the subway, especially if you use TMoney, there is mo need to worry bout having enough small change. But check out the exit number you should take to your destination. Reason being once you out of the train you can hardly have any space and time to examine all the exit points and where each lead to as other pax are rushing all around you. It can be overwhleming."
"Quite simply the fastest, least expensive and most headache free to get around Seoul if you don't have luggage","Quite simply, Seoul has a fantastic subway system and it is very inexpensive. Once you figure out the maps and how to purchase one-time tickets or a prepaid card, it's pretty easy to use. The ticket kiosks have an English option and are easy to use. Tip: always check the local map in the station before exiting to find the exit # for the street you want to exit onto, so that you won't have to use cross walks - saves a lot of time"
I love Korean Subway!,"It's always clean, safe, quiet. Its the best transport in S.Korea. People are nice and friendly.All stations announced in Korean, English,Chinese, and Japanese especially downtown.I hardly recommend."
Seoul Metro,"This is the one. One of the best transportation services in the world. Metro lines are interconnected with all the bus lines through the whole Seoul metropolitan city. So, if you transit in half an hour, you don't have to pay for the next service with bus. If you start the trip first with buses, same thing for the metro. Isn't it good?So, why don't you try and taste. One thing!Most of them (passengers) are like the photo that I share with..."
amazing and well organized metro system,"Consists of lines 1 through 9 plus the Jungang Line, Bundang Line, and Gyeongui Line. The color-coded subway lines make the Seoul Metro quite easy to use. The subway opens from 5:30 until24:00. The estimated travel time between stations is 2~3 minutes."
Most economical way to get around in Seoul,"Super clean and easy to use system, signages very clear even for foreignors, most poeple are helpful with directions, we stayed in Gangnam area and really convenient to get around to Apgugeong and Sinsadong area, best way to get around the city."
"Safe, Clean, Easy Transfer and Very Reliable","I've been to Seoul twice and both times, I never tried other transportation aside from Seoul Metro. The train and the station is well maintain and clean. I'm not sure if they are the one responsible for keeping the restrooms clean but that needs a lot of improvement (at least to some stations). Going around Seoul becomes easy and hiring a tour guide becomes unnecessary since their subway stations are very accessible. "
extremely foreign friendly,"Extremely foreign friendly, even better than Osaka and Japan in that regard, always on time, clean, you get the idea"
Easily the Worlds Best Metro,"Clean, safe, punctual, easy-to-use and tourist friendly (Korean, Chinese, and English signs and announcements). Super easy to get anywhere in Seoul or Busan at an extremely cheap price. Download the Kakao Metro App (there's an English version) for seamless transfer information as well as exit information, right down to which carriage would be best for each transfer or station exit. Love this metro."
What goes around comes around,Fresh public transportation. Compared to Europe or the US traveling in Seoul metro is a luxury opption.
Simply the Best,"I have been all over the would and can say with reservation, after living in Seoul for the last nine years, that the Seoul subway system and the connecting K-Rail system is the best I mass transit I have ever encountered. Easy to use for an English speaker, inexpensive, frequent trains stopping at city wide stations, along with many attractions, underground shopping, eating and entertainment make the Seoul Metro a world class operation and the best way to see the city."
Works very well,Once you figure it out it is very easy to navigateClean and reasonably pricedPay by how far you go or you can load up a card and just keep going until you have to add more money
Easy metro,Seoul metro works very easy.Especially with a T-money card.Just load it at a metro station.Then you don't have to buy tickets any more.
Excellent Public Transporation,"First time visiting Seoul. In the Seoul Official Tourist Guide listed all the top tourist attractions places with specific subway station exit. Sightseeing in Seoul has become so simple. It is very tourist friendly public transportation. English translations everywhere. There are always several exits at each station, look for the big map, it will show the surrounding area near the station. Many subway stations have retail shops and food vendors. Very convenience!!Get the subway card and load it with money so save you time to buy individual tickets and save a few each trip. The subway doesn't run 24 hours so they have time to maintain and clean the stations. Very clean and safe. Hardly see any homeless people sleeping at the subway stations."
I love the music!,"The metro is clean, safe and bilingual. It has excellent coverage of the capital city and connects to locations in the neighbouring Gyeonggi province such as Incheon (for the international airport). The highlight for me is that many of the lines play music on the platform to signal the arrival of a train. When you are on board, there is music to signify that the train is pulling into an interchange station.The carriages are very wide which provides huge capacity. To cap all of this, prices are very cheap compared to London and the Seoul metro smart card can be used on buses in other locations. (I used mine in Incheon and Chuncheon.)"
Great way to travel around Seoul,"Clean, efficient and easy to navigate is how I would describe Seoul's metro system. Everything is in Korean and English and the people are so orderly and polite. Faster and cheaper than travelling by taxi."
Perfect,Seoul station can connect to every place in the South Korea. You can cross the country using Korean subway and train services. It's a good way to know more the South Korea. 
Extensive rail network!,Very cheap and easy to use. Very safe too. You can get anywhere in the city AND the airports (both of them). Traffic here is terrible. This is the easiest way to get around.
Sightseeing ,Seoul is a beautiful city with helpful people....very clean metro and easy to get around the city. Best idea is to have a landmark to orient your way around the city.
Easy and fast,"Seoul's metro system is amazing, trains come really quickly, I think the longest I've waited between trains was 5 minutes. The signs are in english, and the lines run everywhere you could want to go"
Very efficient and easy to use!,"I took the metro with my brother to get around town, it was super efficient and quite easy to use! Definitely try it when you're there!"
"Convenient, fast and clean","During my stay in Seoul I ride the subway everywhere! Get a T-Money card in the vending machines in every station - they do have a button to select English. Just charge and beep the card when you enter and exit the stations.The subway system might seem complicated at first but just download the app in your phone called ""Subway Korea"" to pick the station you are and the station you want to go that it will give you options how to get there. I used all the time while I was in Seoul! Be aware that sometimes Google Maps do not work well in the city - once it gave me a route to change subway lines and stations to get from point A to point B where I could just walk half a mile to get there.One very important information is to know which exit you should get off to the place where you want to go because there are multple exits in every stations and it can save you crossing a big avenue or being closer to where you want to go. The stations have signs everywhere, just follow the directions and you will be fine.I encounter some stations - the purple one for example - that did not have elevators in the station, it might be challenging for people with problems with mobility or that are carrying a baby stroller for example. The elevators sometimes is not very well signalize so if you need them, ask someone.Another thing about subways in Korea, if you are not a expecting mom, elderly or disabled do not sit in the reserved seats even if the train is full and the seats are empty because they respect those seats and will not occupy them. I saw a guy being told off in a train because of that.The stations usually have lots of shops and food stalls, so while you are going to where you are going, so don't rush through the stations."
Hints on this place,"1) If you are going to use metro more than once use T-money card. You can get it in a vending machine on every station. Put money on a card and pay for metro on entrance. Also T-money card is suitable for buying tickets on some trains and buses, also as a ticket in several places.3) When you buy single ride ticket you pay for a ride AND make a deposit at the same time, 'cause the price of a card is included. Many turists don't know about it.2) You can return any ticket and get refund! Don't drop even used single ride ticket. Use deposit refund machines that are usually situated near vending machines.3) Platforms and tunnels are often very long. You may walk 150 m just to interchange from line to line on one station.4) Watch for pink seats for pregnant women. )5) WC in a stations"
Convenient,"- very clean - incredibly easy to use and announcements of all stations in English and Korean - the trains and stations are announced with different,catchy tunes - would definitely recommend as the easiest way to travel around Seoul"
Cleanest most convenient subway system you'll ever use,"Seoul metro is ON POINT. coming from someone who works in NYC, the NYC Metro System is pretty gross but also gets you everywhere. Take that, add a ton of cleanliness and you get the Seoul metro system. The Seoul metro system is SUPER easy to get around everywhere within Seoul and in and around the area, as well as is super clean. Everything is laid out very easy and it's very easy to navigate. Rates are pretty cheap too - make sure you have your card with you for both entry and exit since they do add an incremental cost if you travel far (but it's pretty minimal - 100 WON at most)"
Get the Amazing Pay Seoul Card at the Airport Bus Counter,"For non-Korean speakers, the Seoul Metro system is relatively easy to use and navigate. From Ticketing to Exit Information, it's pretty much self-explanatory. If you are visiting Seoul for a week or so and will be travelling to and from Incheon via buses, using the Seoul Metro or just riding taxis in the city, you may want to invest in a Amazing Pay Seoul Card. You don't need to worry about getting metro tickets at the vending machines or paying your taxi driver with cash. All it requires is tapping at the designated electronic payment ""receiver."" The only caveat is one person per card, if you have any balance left, you can always spend it at a convenience store. The pass also offers discounts at certain tourist attractions. Can't remember exactly how much it was per card, I want to say KW$49,000(???) "
convenient to everywhere but little elevator,Seoul Metro is convenient because it can take travelers to almost sightseeing spots in Seoul. But its very inconvenient not every exit has the elevator. Most exit only has ladder. And it need to walk long distance to translate to the other line from airport railroad.
Clean and Spacious,"Compared to the metro in new york, LA, or Beijing, the seoul metro is bigger and much cleaner. Getting a seat is much easier compared to Beijing, where you can almost never sit."
"Very convenient, and easy-to use!","The Seoul Metro is known to be very convenient. It is quite large with many lines and lots of stops, reaching everywhere in the city. However, it is a bit expensive - one direction 2,950won. It does not have a multiple-use or day-card (at least I could not find)."
Convenient mode of transport,Seoul Metro is a convenient mode of transport even for tourists. Stations have a lot of ticketing and reloading machines. Advisable to use the metro card; just tap in and out of stations.
Fantastic system,"Easy to use , very clean trains & platforms.Cheap , buy a card & off you go.Good network, signage in English .... London have a look at this underground it's much better."
"Easy, clean, fast","If you buy the card from machine, you can take your deposit back. But it's more convenient to go to any convenience store like CU or 7/11 to buy T-money card. T-money card will charge you less and you can use it anywhere. Very clean. If it's your first time, you might download KakaoMetro application for guidance. "
always on time and easy way to travel around seoul,"ticket vending machines are the sole way in buying tickets, not much route maps in the station, no information area for tourists sometimeslocals are helpful too and seoul metro guys are also helpful in assisting lost tourists"
Buy T money ticket,From first day get your T money ticket and use it everywhere even in the taxi it is very covenient. With the subway you can go everywhere in Seoul much faster than with ground transportation.
So easy to use!,Using the Seoul Metro was extremely easy. The maps were easy to follow and were in both English and Korean. I had no problem navigating my way around the metro station. I never had a problem buying tickets using the kiosk. There were always people around to help. Depending on the station there are shops and restaurants. The easiest and cheapest way to get around Seoul.
Great way to get around the city,Clean safe and cheap. The only time it was a bit confusing when we had to change lines. Of course a bit crowded Durring rush hours.
Los Angeles Could Learn a Thing or Two,"Prompt. Fast. Smooth travels. Clean. Cheap. Safe. What more could a person ask for from public transportation? The Seoul Metro is a great way to get around for both locals and tourists. You don't need to speak Korean to use it as the maps are so user-friendly. And the machines for loading the cards are in various languages, so it's easy to buy and load the metro cards. If only L.A. could do something like this. Sigh!"
Wasy to use,"Great and easy to use, all the ticket machines have an English ""button"" so there is no guessing involved. Simple to transfer from 1 to another line."
Metro,Well even through we know almost no Korean we decided to jump on metro and go to fish market. Both were very good metro can. Be slightly confusing but download app for you language it much better. Also most of the kids or young adults speak English and are very helpful. Metro is very clean and amazingly cheap to ride
Easy to get around,"The metro system in seoul is pretty similar with the metro system in London, easy to learn and gets you around all of central Seoul. Used it everyday when I visited and did not use a taxi once."
Convenient and Cheap,Seoul Metro has a great network across the city and out to the airports. I recently caught a KTX from Busan to Seoul and the connection to metro was an easy underground walkway to the subway. Changing trains at Samkajki was also very easy and it took me less than 20 minutes to get to my local station about 7 stops and one train change away. 
Clockwork,"If in doubt. Catch the Seoul Metro. Clean, interesting, friendly and completely reliable. Even during the metro workers strike the service continued to run efficiently. And there is another world to experience on the Seoul Metro."
Great service,"Safe, reliable, clean, most of the times super crowded, but very fast. You can pretty much go everywhere in soul. The major stops are in English too, but the ones more local only available in Korean, so it's better to study the stops prior you leave."
Immaculate subway,"The subway system is easy to use and very helpful to see a great city. The subway system is very clean and safe,"
How i loved my T-money card,So easy to navigate. Download their app and get real time schedules. Free wifi everywhere. Could get crowded during rush hours as in any metro city but so far all the metros I've taken Seoul's is the best because its easy to navigate even for a foreigner
The Best public transportation!,"You can go most of places by subway. The map may look complicated, but it is very useful. It covers not only Seoul but also other cities around Seoul. They announce in English japanese and chinese. The fare is amazingly cheap comparing other countries. Come to Seoul and enjoy it!"
Very efficient ,"Using the subway, especially in Seoul, is an incredibly efficient way to get around considering the vehicular traffic around the clock. Each station is very accommodating for disabled and strollers."
Best way to travel around Seoul and Gyeonggi-do,"Efficient, clean, cheap and covers a huge area. Once you get the hang of it it's pretty easy to manage getting around. Hands down one of the most user-friendly subway systems I've ever tried. There are lines that can get pretty suffocating around rush hours but unfortunately it's an inevitable damage of big cities."
Amazing Public Transportation,"Timely, cheap, clean, and easy to navigate--if you're used to US public transportation, you'll be blown away by how great it is here."
Great transportation option in Seoul,"Easy ti use, with English as option in the ticket machines and also within the train, announcing the station name. Metro line covers whole city and price is affordable. Each trip ticket takes 500 won deposit per person which you can get back at the end of your trip ( just put the card in the deposit return machine). Trains are very clean with lots of sitting places. Its easy to navigate the lines; all interchangeable stations are clearly marked and announced within the train. "
Cheap and Easy Metro System,"Every stop is in english, japanese, and chinese with is great for tourists and is cheaper compared to Japan and other countries. Very clean too."
Efficient,Very efficient. Used the metro every time we can when we were in Seoul. Buy a T-Money card at any convenience store for easier travel.
Best ever,Metro is very efficent. All Korean signs has english translations. I have been to so many countries but Seoul Metro is simply the best. Beats SingaporeMetro!! 
Fun easy and clean,Stayed in gingham and travelled everywhere by metro. Cards were supplied by our hotel but the top up was easy. Directionswere easy enough and the connectivity underground made sub zero temperature bearable.we went to see haha Hadid's architecture in Dong Dae Mung and the container shopping area from Gangam. The metro station was right outside the Park Hyatt. My only complaint is that there is a lack of escalators so it was tiring climbing up and down to the trains.
GREAT!!!!,"There is everything for nice stay, e.g. meals, toilets, etc Trains are regular, nice connections, trains with warm seats"
Metro is fun and easy to get around,The Seoul Metro is very clean and easy to use. Many people speak English and the metro maps are easy to understand. The fares are cheap and you can take it anywhere. It is very safe. You do not have to worry about pick pockets or any other crime.
Fast and reliable,This is a cool way to travel. Not too crowded and tickets are easy to purchase. Clean and the service was good. Hope to go back!
"Very impressive, easy to use","So was to use, efficient and great experience. Ticket machines in English, easy to follow maps everywhere, well since and fellow passengers very eager to help. Impressively spotless and modern. Absolutely loved traveling on the Seoul metro. A must do."
Great transportation ,"The best I have ever experienced so easy to use and good value for money. Modern in design and safe in every concept, the carriages are much larger than in London and Paris and English is shown in both display and spoken announcements.It is easy to purchase the travel card and then to top it up as needed even single trips are simple to purchase should you not have this card. Transfer between different lines are made simple and easy to follow directions on each station.You really do have to admire the design and ease of use of this modern transportation system "
Impressive,"I was afraid that I will get lost because of the many lines I see on the map. But honestly, after once or twice, you will be comfortable with the transferring. The announcement system is very good. Something I find it amusing is about the seats for elderly and pregnant women. As it's dedicated for them, even in peak periods where the seats are empty, no one will sit on it. Everyone is very automatic, they gave up their seats when there's elderly or pregnant women in from of them even though it's not designated seats. You are allowed to drink in the subway. I'm not sure about food though. But regardless, everyone is very responsible, you won't see trash, everyone will make sure they don't anyhow throw trash. Of course, there's also someone to clean up, but that makes their job much easier! Salute!"
Why cab when you have Seoul Metro?,"The metro is a cheap and efficient way to get around Seoul. Period. Their lines are well-organised and they bring you to almost every part of Seoul. I found the lines a little messy and complicated at first, but I got the hang of it, especially after using the Korean Subway mobile app. I didn't even bother to flag any taxis during my stay in Seoul. The only downside is that their stations are filled with stairs everywhere, especially the entrances/exits.It's best to get the T-money card which you can purchase at their local stores."
Easy to use and efficient. ,"This is a huge modern system. It is fast, usually full and easy to use. We went from the airport to Seoul main station and changed to the subway to our hotel. The cars are clean with lots of seats and hand holds. It is inexpensive and a fast way to get around this huge city. "
Know your Line and Exit,"Each station has multiple exits that are far from each other. To travel more efficiently, know the closest exit near you and line you should take. We were blessed to meet an ""uncle"" who brought us to our exit (5 minutes walk) and made sure we took the correct Line when we got lost. "
Well organised,"The metro is a cheap and efficient way to get around Seoul. The local (central) trips cost les than £1.I downloaded an app which allowed me to put in my start and stop station and it told me the line to take, when the next train was due, how long the journey would take and how much it would cost. The trains and stations were clean. They were on time.The only downside was they got very crowded around 6pm."
Very best way to travel....,This is the very best way to travel....Super convenient....Was a little challenged in directions...Communication wise but super worth it...
easy to use,"bought me a T-Money metro card for 3000 krw and used this for 2 days! with this card you can pay cabs, subway, bussed and sometime in a 7eleven!"
Gets You to Where You Need to Go,"There isn't really anything that special about most of these lines. However, they are consistent, clean, and quick. If you're trying to get around Seoul, this is the way to go. Be sure to get a Pop card at a convenience store instead of the passes if you want to save a few bucks, they can be reloaded."
Very fast and convienant,"MRT is very fast, clean and gets you to places within seconds. However, it may be a little confusing at first. But once you get use to it, its very easy. We purchased the T- money card from the automatic ticket machine and refilled it with cash. The card can also be used for making small purchases. Overall, a very nice experience."
Best way to travel,"As the traffic in Seoul is so busy, the Metro is the best way to travel around. Some stations are quite large and a biy confusing but there are signs and maps in English all around that make it quite easy to get around."
Anywhere in Seoul you can find a metro,Seoul is very accessible by Metro. In fact I dare say it will bring you to your destination faster than other transport options. 
It cmplicated and messy but understandable,"It easy to hopping from one subs line to other line, but it wasn't easy at some point when you get wrong stop at substation ,you may have to continue to others stops,100km increase 100 won if not mistaken for total ride., easy to use since it just using card to topup and etc."
Thumbs up !,"Because their transport system is very efficient , it is so easy to go from one place to another. Take the AREX from Incheon airport , if you have plans of passing by other areas , other than Seoul then take the AREX with ""All Stops"" otherwise if you want a straight , no stop train ride then take the Express train... for a little bit more price"
Very Convenient Transportation,"Very easy to navigate around Seoul and even up to Baekyangri and Gapyeong Stations. Also, fare is very reasonable."
easy travel mode,most hotels in the city are near the Metro. trains are reasonably priced and maps are available. clean trains
Confuse at First but Relief after :-),"Read so much about the Seoul Metro until i experience it myself how convenient the Seoul Metro isArrived Seoul around 3pm local time and directly transfer ourselves to the Incheon Station. Since this is my first time to Seoul it's better I asked the information counter about my train and station. I was given with a few Exit No. and the final station for my destination...and telling to myself that it's easy just follow the instructionThen when I went down to the station...it wasn't that easy....coz, most Korean don't speak English, when i am trying to ask around, at first they refuse to help, but some come back and trying their best to point out our exact location..We were confuse with the route, the color, the next station...etc etc it took us like almost 3 hours from the actual 1 and half hour to reach our station at Noksapyeong Station.But guess what, on 2nd day, I figured out all about the Metro system1) Check first your destination by looking at the Color of the route2) Identify the ""Sam-taegeuk"" Logo as the station of transit, inside the train, it will announced differently with the music they played, something like traditional music before arrived at this transit station3) When you enter the station, make sure you follow the color of route to the train you want to take, and always identify the final route of the train as the guideline to the correct train.4) If you not sure about which train to take but you already arrived at the correct station, just look at the sign on the entrance it indicate your NEXT stationit's so easy, so efficient the train arrived within 15 second just after the music played or the announcement. You might not understand the Korean language but with the maps, you can go anyway you likeThe train is very spacious, they even have warm seat for winter. And Korean they normally won't mind sitting side by side to you, not like in some country they prefer to sit with female if they are female. Oh, don't forget to buy the T-Money at any convenient store...I saw some queue up at the 7-Eleven just outside the arrival hall...well, just go down there r plenty of store at the lower basement selling the T-Money CardIt's a good way to travel to places I really enjoy my ride everytime i use it"
Transportation,"It reaches almost anywhere in the metropolitan Seoul area. It is the oldest, therefore the trains are also old."
Great Transportation,"I grew up in a city that did not have any type of subway systems, when I arrived to Seoul it was super easy to navigate the subway system. I reccomend using Subway Korea app to use. The subways are super cheap and there is always a subway stop close by to wherever you want to go."
"convenient, with wi-fi","It was easy to get around and the connections are great. Ticket machines are available in English and it is affordable, works until late"
Seoul Metro,I found the Metro very good and user friendly. The schedule was always on time. The trains were always clean.
Convenient ,Seoul metro is very convenient and best way to travel in Seoul.. Usually there is lot of traffic and metro is the fastest option. Buy a T money card from any seven eleven or convenient store and you can use that everywhere for metro and bus. 
Convenient and efficient ,The metro is very convenient as it is linked to almost everywhere in Seoul. The train network is rather complicated due to the numerous lines available. It is rather crowded at times but still manageable.
Best Metro In The World,"The best way to get around Seoul. All the train lines weave there way around the city crossing over at various points allowing you to change trains without leaving the station. Like Tokyo each line is colour coded making it easy to navigate with out being able to speak the language, The trains are so clean really really clean with heated seats."
Best transit I've experienced yet.,"The metro is simple, quick and the trains are numerous. You can get anywhere in Seoul with minimal transfers and the trains aren't typically too crowded for travelers if you know when to use them."
Massive. ,"Huge metro system. Biggest I have ever used. Makes London look small!Names can be hard to get used to but there's so many stations you never need to even consider a bus or taxi for a holiday. It's all at a train station. Brilliant. I didn't buy the pass, probably would looking back, as each ticket has a 500won deposit so you stop to buy ticket, then at the end you stop to get your deposit back. Having the card would save time.Tip - if using metro for airport (Incheon) allow plenty of time and take express train on line 9 if possible. It's a long way to airport from downtown Seoul. We didn't google time, we assumed it would be faster than he weekend traffic and it wasn't.... "
Efficient and extensive!,"The Seoul Metro is one of the best in Asia and ranks with Tokyo, Hong Kong, and Beijing for how extensive and far reaching it is. If you will be in Seoul for more than a day or two ATA highly recommends you get a Metro Card which you can charge easily and can buy at almost any convenience store. There are plenty of subway apps you can download before arrival, just search ""Korea Subway"" and you should be set!"
Dizzyingly confusing,"The system is quite efficient but finding you're route can be a real challenge. Unlike in Japan where there is always someone near the turnstiles to assist foreigners, I've seen numerous information desks here at train stations which are not manned. Worse, one guy turned his back on us when my ticket didn't work then put up a ""lunch break"" sign. What a louse!Trains are ok but most stations dont have escalators or lifts. I've seen old people and children having difficulty managing the stairs. Toilets are also far apart from each other but I love the easy-to-manage ticket machines, deposit-refund machines, and top up machines. Signs are also scarce in some stations like Euljiro. We had to take a very circuitous route because we couldn't find the exit recommended by our hotel. Walls are full of ads competing with directional signs which are mostly smaller than the wall ads hence they get drowned, and difficult to instantly find. Overall, it's still the most efficient means of going around the city. "
Convenient,"An easy, cheap and convenient way to move about in Seoul. To ensure you get the most out of it you should download the Seoul Metro App (just search for Seoul). It is a must. And remember to return your ticket card, the will reimburse you with 500 WON for it…. "
Perfect way to move,"Also you can you from the airport, you can choose between a single ticket or if you have time to find the T-Money machine, so you can buy a t money card and after you just have to put your new card on the metro machine to charge with the amount that you want, maybe put 10'000 Won for a couple of days."
Clean and safe,Trains here in seoul are clean and safe. They arrive on time and the kiosk are easy to operate. Plus you get a deposit back after your reaching your destination simply for going to the return/reimburse card.
Satisfied ,Travel with young children. Very satisfied . The price is good . It's crowded in office time but off time really enjoyable.
Fast and On-Time...better than HK metro,Using the T-Money card is golden. It pretty much gets a person anywhere you want to go in Korea. Look foward to the upgrades in preparation for the Winter Games next year!
One of the best public transport systems in the world,"One you must do while in Seoul is take a trip on a subway train. Just be aware that in the mornings and afternoons when people are commuting to and from work, it could get insainly crowed. Nothing to worry about as long as you look at it as an experience and are not claustrophobic. Just relax and take in the experience. You'll have a story to talk about, for years to come. BTW, Seoul is a very safe city and you dont have to worry about any type of crime at all, while in their subway system. Very clean and safe, unlike New York, LA, Paris etc."
"Efficient, fast, clean, extensive network","it's our understand that this is one of the largest subway networks in the world (about 206 miles at present). Signs are in 3 languages, incl. English. Taking the train from Incheon airport into town takes about 48 min. (depending on whether or not you're taking the express train); the slower one will take you over an hour. Each station is announced ahead of time and there's a digital TV display. We were incredibly impressed since nothing of the kind exists in most US cities. It's much cheaper to take the train, avoid massive traffic, then taking an expensive cab. Check it out."
Easy,Don't fear using the underground. Ticket machines have English settings and train maps are easy to figure out.We avoided rush hour though. Advise you do the same.
What will I do without you..,"Like seriously, what would I do without Seoul Metro?? As many users accurately pointed out, this train system is complicated, very complicated.. but once you overcome the complexity that serves a city of 10 million people, you'll be in awe of its amazing connectivity and efficiency. Our hotel is in Ojang-dong, nearest station is Dongdaemun History and Culture Park. This bloody station alone has 10 freaking exits.. each exit approximately 5 - 10mins walk (underground) away from each other... Now, on our very first try, it was infinitely frustrating especially with the hordes of people that are swarming around you, but once we got above ground and got the hank of things, we realize how big or much of an area 1 station can cover, and it was honestly quite amazing. Now, a general tip from our getting lost experience, pick up a tourist map once you arrive at the airport for Seoul (can't remember the title but it was a pretty thick booklet). It has the entire metro line in its pages, and they booklet categorizes the places of interest according to location, proximity to each other AND tells you which lines to take! I suggest planning ahead by like circling which stations you have to transit at BEFORE hitting the train station because you WILL get lost.. Once you get the hang of things though, you will find it extremely convenient.. I would choose the metro line and its crowds over the grumpiness of the taxi drivers any time.."
Efficient transportation,"Very easy to navigate with the Seoul Explorer app. The maps listed in the stations were either printed with English words that were way too small or there weren't any English words at all. However once you get the hang of it, it's really easy to navigate in Seoul. Just a little distance to get from one platform to the other at the bigger interchanging stations. "
"Best public transport system in the World, get a T-Money card","For some mysterious reasons Google map does not work properly in S.Korea, but it stills gives you directions on using the Metro and Buses. I found the bus is sometimes much more convenient point to point. Get a T-Money card (electronic money card) from the nearest convenient store and charge it up, it will save you lots of agony getting tickets from machines."
Complicated at first,At first I felt like wooh the metro is so complicated but really after my first day I became very used to the changes of lines. I also started taking short cuts using various lines with ease. It's clean and I noticed that no matter have far you station is the price is fixed at 1350won with a 500won refundable deposit. Only problem was don't have many stations with escalators or lifts so one has to use the steps. But it's good exercise.
"One of the great subway systems, and my favorite","Seoul's subway system, constantly expanded since the opening of the first line in 1974, is what makes the modern city function. I've grown to rely on it with every visit to Seoul, and although it has its quirks and headaches, it still is the one subway system that keeps me the most satisfied, especially compared to other vast subway systems of the world like the New York City Subway, London Underground, or Tokyo Subway.- Overview -Although the title is Seoul Metro for this review, in reality there are several operators for the vast subway system in Seoul, of which Seoul Metro is only one (though the most prominent). Seoul Metro, a public corporation owned by the city, is responsible for operating Lines 1 through 4, which first opened between 1974 and 1985 and have been extended several times since. Lines 5 through 8 are run by a second city-owned public corporation, SMRT, having opened in the 1990s, while Line 9 is run by a private company. Named lines are part of the national railroad system and managed by the national government's Korail; Korail also runs above-ground portions of Line 1 (which were mainline rail lines in the past), as well as the portions of Line 3 and 4 outside Seoul city limits.- Fares and Ticketing -For single rides, in addition to the published fare which starts at ₩1250, it is also necessary to pay a ₩500 deposit for the reusable smart card itself. Upon the return of the card at the end of the journey, the deposit is refunded.For repeated rides, the best choice is the T-Money debit card, available at all stations, with a nonrefundable ₩3000 deposit. There is a ₩100 discount for every journey taken with a T-Money, so it is the way to go for longer visits, hardcore sightseeing, or convenience. T-Money also allows for free transfers to buses. T-Money is also good for transit systems in most other major South Korean cities as well, as well as paying for taxi fares, certain convenient stores and other vendors, and pay phones. I had a T-Money card left over from my 2008 residence in Seoul, which I was able to easily re-use for my January 2017 visit as well.Regardless of the ticket type, all fares are based on distance. If using T-Money and transferring to/from buses, then the fare is calculated on the entire journey's distance including the bus portion. And I appreciated that regardless of which rail operator(s) I used, the fare calculation did not change and transfers were seamless, unlike in Tokyo where every operator change resulted in extra fare, often a new full fare.- Riding -Tickets can be purchased from vending machines or staffed counters. Vending machines can also charge T-Money cards with additional balance.Tap the ticket at the turnstile to enter the system.Follow the signs to the proper platform. Each line is color-coded, and each platform will list the major stations and the terminal served by the trains stopping there.Each station's name is in Korean and English. It may also be in Hanja (Korean-style Chinese characters) on older signs, or in Chinese and Japanese on newer signs. There is also a station number that denotes the line and the station's sequence on the line, though station numbers are not used as prominently in Seoul as they are in Tokyo.Overhead electronic displays show the progress of the next train and its destination. On many lines, not all trains will run the entire length of the line, so be careful. Screen doors keep riders from falling into the tracks at just about all stations; with the sky-high suicide rates in South Korea, they were a must.- On board -Stay to the sides of each door and let disembarking passengers out first before boarding.Seats at the end of each car are priority seats for the elderly and disabled, and will be marked accordingly.Recorded station announcements are made in Korean and English, and displayed inside the train as well, complete with information on which side doors will open. In some cases, they may be in Chinese and Japanese as well. Transfer information will also be called out. Some trains have LCD monitors that display short news clips as well. With the installation of screen doors, it's often difficult to look out the window to identify the stop, so clear announcements inside the car are very appreciated.Mobile phones should be kept in silent mode, but at least they will work pretty much throughout the system. In many cases, some Korean domestic mobile phone subscribers will also have complimentary Wi-Fi access on board each train.- Transfers and Exits -At a transfer station, look for signs and banners in the color of the line to be taken next. Too often, transfers in Seoul can be a long walk; I've seen worse walks in New York and Tokyo, but Seoul's transfers can be quite long and painful in many cases, and some transfer corridors can be surprisingly narrow. They may also involve a lot of stair-climbing, which I do not appreciate.For most transfers, even when changing to a line of a different operator, there won't be any new turnstiles to go through. The exception is the A'REX airport railroad to/from Incheon Airport, which has its own turnstiles, but as long as proper transfer corridors are used without exiting the subway system, fare calculation will remain the same as any other subway journey.For exiting, follow the yellow signs and tap the ticket again at the turnstile to leave the system. If using a single ticket, don't forget to return it for the deposit refund.A given Seoul subway station most likely will have multiple exits, up to two dozen, sequentially numbered. Check the vicinity maps and overhead signs to determine the correct exit to use.- Wrap-up -Seoul's subway system is a gem. Definitely intimidating for the uninitiated due to the sheer complexity, once I get the hang of it, it is the greatest sidekick for moving through life in hectic Seoul. Widespread screen doors and Wi-Fi, clean and well-maintained facilities, and very frequent service, make it a pleasure to reach just about any part of the city, and for those few areas where the subway does not reach, easy bus transfers are available as well.I always appreciate cities with excellent subway systems. Some, like New York, London, and Tokyo, are known for their own intimidating systems with amazing coverage. Others, like Hong Kong and Vancouver, are known for ultra-modern facilities. I've always felt that Seoul gives me the best of both worlds, even though some transfers can be on the long side and there is more stair climbing involved than I would like. Here is to more future visits to Seoul, and more rides on the amazing subway system that makes the city tick."
Signage can be confusing. Lots of stairs. Not always with escalators. Lifts non-existent or not functioning. ,"Seoul metro can be frustrating. Especially if you have baggage or kids in toll. Many long passage ways to walk to reach the train lines, connections may not be straight forward. Also many stairs up and down to reach the intended lines or exit. Not always escalators present. Lifts were sometimes present but mostly not functioning or had some Korean instructions we can't read. Some lifts were even turned off. Some lifts were redundant because they went nowhere! Quite strange. It was especially frustrating with luggage as you have to navigate these long passage ways , up and down stairs (no ramps mostly), no lifts etc. don't understand why it's so un-user-friendly! The system is simple enough to use and it will get you places BUT reaching the lines may not be easy with kids , pram or luggage. Not good for elderly either, saw many local Korean senior citizens struggling on the stairs up and down, wobbling knees, no lifts or escalators to help. Terrible. The authorities really need to look into making the system more user friendly and considerate to the public. "
very complicated maps,"for the 1st day we taking ths metro, its very confusing! then try to ask people,they dont want to help us its a very efficient transport in south korea! easy access! a lot of places u can go! download the maps on ur smartphone, to make it easier for u! "
easy access to many places,"First it was little bit difficult to learn how metro system works in Seoul. Luckily I had read from internet that it can be difficult for the first time but when you learn it, it really makes sense and it's easy to use. You can go to many popular sightseeings and areas by metro. But notice that even if you take metro, you have to walk quite a lot. Great think is also that you can find stores (especially cosmetics) and food stalls in metro stations so you won't get hungry if you get lost. During rush hour it can be very cramped. As everywhere take care of your belongings."
A brilliant system!,The Metro system in Seoul certainly knows how to move people incredibly efficiently! Station names and directions are in Korean and English and the prices are cheap. If are able to move quite well and enjoy walking it is the best way to travel in Seoul!
Seats for seniors are always available,"I went to Korea with my parents and I was initially concerned about having to stand and walk for long periods. To my surprise, Koreans do not occupy privileged seats for seniors and pregnant women and my parents could always find seats in the train. There were also seats and convenience stores in most stations where you could stop to have a snack and beverage. As we went during winter, if we were to pass a subway station, we would make it a pit stop for our parents to have a hot beverage and a short rest. In terms of navigation, prior homework is a necessity due to the multiple lines criss-crossing each other. It was relatively easy thereafter as signs are quite clear even though I do not understand a word of korean. If you have difficulties, you can approach the information counter and they'll be happy to assist. There were still people working during Seollal. If you travel in a group, it may be more economical and practical to travel by taxi for short distances. This is because a standard fare of 1250won is deducted per person regardless of the distance travelled in between stations "
Don't be fooled. A hell lot of walking involved,"The metro can reach almost every part of touristic Seoul. However, we are not a fan of the station designs. Not enough escalators, narrow alleys. Stations that are pendicular to each other rather than stacked means a hell lot of walking even if they are ""interchange"" stations. It just that you don't go out of a paid zone. Some are worse - interchange stations that are located in different buildings or are about 300m walking distance apart. Those with heavy luggage to drag around - get a cab. It'll be worth it."
Fastest Subway,It was a wonderful and nice experience. Most of the announcements are in Korean and the TVs which are provided to know the location and directions are also not working. 
Efficient subway but why is it a must do,"Coming from Singapore which has an equally good subway system, I can't help but feeling that classifying the metro as the number 1 thing to do is an insult to other more deserving tourist sights. I almost did not make the trip because I thought if Seoul's best thing to do is to ride on the metro, then it is not a place I wanted to visit. Well, Seoul is an interesting place to visit and not because of the metro. So I am marking it down to give other sights more prominence."
exceptional frequency,"I've been in korea for 8 days and this is my major transportation during my stay. What i can say is, this is the most preferred public transport in korea and the train frequency is exceptional and punctual. the train is comfortable and fast. ticket can be paid using T-Money or you can also buy at the machine. Most of the stations located at all major attractions, with easy interchange. But please prepare your physical to climb steep staircases as some of the station do not provide escalator. "
Clean and easy,"The Seoul Metro system is very clean and easy to use. The subway operation hours are from 5:30 to approximately 24:00. The metro lines are color coded; which makes figuring out what line goes where very simple. The ticket machines are automatic and all of the ones I've used also have the option of English language. Maps are posted and there are several Seoul (as well as other Korean cities) metro map apps available for download for your phone. The cost is more than affordable and the system has grown to the point that it will definitely get you anywhere you need to go. If you will be in Seoul awhile or plan to use the public transit system quite a bit during a short trip, it is more economical to purchase the ""T Money"" card and put money (Won) on it. You then simply touch the card to the ""pay pads"" and keep moving. People are doing it constantly, so you'll quickly figure out what to do. The cards are available at the ticket machines and at just about any convenient store. Just ask for ""T Money card"", you put as much or as little money as you want on the card and the card is refillable. The great thing about the T Money card is that it can be used to pay for all modes of public transportation. You can use it for the metro, on the public busses, and in taxis! I love it. "
Convenient mode of transport ,"The Seoul metro connects to almost all points. For tourists, it will be convenient getting to and fro attractions. Colored lines coupled with numbering system makes it easy to understand.My tip is to get a T-money card (deposit 3k won which is non refundable) which allows you to top up according to use (from as low as 1k won). Also can be used in most convenience stores. For my trips around Gang-buk area, it is approx 1,250 won (concession rates using T-money card) but lower for kids.Convenient and economical way to get around if you do not mind a bit of walking..."
Provides access to almost every tourist destinations in Seoul,"We used this transport facility in almost every attraction we visited in South Korea. Fast, cheap, and accessible. Lets you transfer easily from one destination to another. Subway connects to the ITX and KTX so there is absolutely no hassle if you wanna take a trip to the north or even far down south to Daegu or Busan. Wifi is available in the train and in every station, reloading machines are also available (but of course you can reload in convenience stores), the recorded audio has English translation and maps are located in every station so you won't get lost. Download the Subway App on your phone to let you know where to transfer and where to get off."
Easy enough ,"Download the Seoul metro app, basically from there you can see where you are, when you have to change lines and when you have to get off. Very easy system to use after the first couple of goes. Much cheaper then taxis & ubers."
Scary at first BUT now piece of cake ,"I can't stop saying: ""Those Koreans are so smart!!!"" And Metro system just proves it si much more... The people have thought of EVERYTHING... there is visible emergency equipment including gas masks. I don't know if it is ME but this is a GREAT place to come to. My little metro card helps me save money on each trip I take AND I can use to to transfer to the bus or other train WITHOUT costing me a dime (within 30 minutes). Metro stations are CLEAN, CLEAN and there is always a place to find to eat something One day I saw the umbrella and some baby shoes and after while as I saw that they didn't belong to anyone i had to ask ""what's up with that?"" I was told that somebody just forgot it...REALLY??? I recently came from the Latin America and there I had to hold on VERY TIGHTLY on my stuff so that it didn't get stolen AND here nobody touches things that are just sitting there all alone and ""lonely"" "
Easy,It's a convenient and well organized subway! Easy for foreigner to travel with just be careful where to go in !
Easy way of transportation ,"Efficient and easy to navigate, plus a fast way of getting to where you want to go. English available. Clean. I would recommend this over a taxi.  "
Seoul metro,"The best way to travel in Seoul and the surrounding area, very very cheap and very easy to find your way round. The carriages are spotless and the seating is heated which given it was 1 deg outside was welcome. "
"Clean, easy, on-time, safe","The metro network is extensive and the system works very well. The signage is very detailed and once you get used to how they do things it's all very clearly done. The trains are fast, clean and on- time. And the cars are much wider than most cities' metros, making getting in and out during busy times much easier."
Convenient,The subway will take you everywhere in Seoul and also connects to major train stations that will take you to other cities. Now you can download apps to understand the subway better and if you Walk around looking lost you are most surly gonna get help from one of the locals. It is convenient to buy tickets from the machine.
The best way to travel,"Fast, convinient, efficient, clean. This has to be one of the top metro systems in the world. After you get to grips with the network layout it becomes the best way to travel. Get one of the cards and load it up with a bit of money and it becomes so easy. Plenty of places to top up the card on either side of the gates so no need to put too much on the card."
A reliable and efficient way to get from Point A to Point,"During our trip to Seoul, we have utilized their Subway system to get to our destinations. The city has a reliable and efficient train system that is on time and affordable. All the city's attractions can be accessed via train which makes it more tourist-friendly."
Excellent time table,"As always, the trains stick to their time table accurate and punctual to the minute. Much better than our local trains."
High Quality Metro,"During my stay in Korea, this was my main method of transport and it has many positives and one negative.Positives- The background music is very relaxing, smooth, calm and entertaining.- The metro is silent, everyone is respectful and tries to be quiet.- It is cheap, fast, and efficient. Negatives- Although it is unavoidable, it can get VERy crowded at times, so if you are a claustrophobic person, try to be careful."
Enjoyment ,I really enjoyed there with my friends First time I eat food like this.its amazing 재밌었어요 다시 갈께요 ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Very easy to get around,"The subway system is easy, efficient and comfortable. The stops are in English as well as Korean on the map and in the stations - that's very helpful."
Very clean and easy to navigate,"Very reliable, clean and easy to navigate to get around. Wifi is plentiful throughout the entire system, and fares are reasonable."
Clean and relatively easy to navigate,"Every station I visited had announcements and ticketing stations in multiple languages. Some of the stations are confusing to navigate, and my ticket cards occasionally didn't read correctly immediately after purchase, but that may have been user error. If you can find your way to and through the station, you can easily go anywhere in the city even if you don't speak Korean."
Not too foreigner friendly,"Excellent coverage of Seoul (although some connections require a fair bit of trekking) and very frequent. Unfortunately some lines are not very foreigner friendly as no announcements or info screens in English and do not follow the station alphanumeric codes of other lines. However, armed with a map, and some prior planning, it can be navigated ok. "
The South Korean public transit system has ruined me,"We regularly travel on public transport abroad and a few metropolitan areas in the US as well. The metro and bus systems were incredibly impressive to me. After returning from Korea I was using the subway in New York City and revealed how it completely paled in comparison to the system in South Korea. The system was very easy to use, very easy to navigate, appropriately priced, and generally the cleanest and most peaceful rides I've ever had on public transport."
Literally the best metro in the world,"Having travelled the world to areas such as Chicago, NYC, Tokyo, Shanghai, all across Europe -- The Seoul Metro is literally the best public transit I have ever utilized anywhere. Subways have wifi, are clean, organized, everything you could possibly want from a metro."
Not perfect but the best Metro system in the world.,"I've been on the metro/subway/underground/elevated/rail/lightrail system of numerous major cities. When weighing in all the factors, the system in Seoul is by far the best I've ever experienced.Price: Super cheap compared to other countries. Starts at $1 USD for basic fare.Reliability: Virtually never breaks down and if there is an interruption in service, it is most likely due to a union strike rather than mechanical issues.Speed: Not the fastest but faster than average. High-speed lines will take you up to 90 km/h (not highspeed rail, I'm talking subway).Efficiency: Extremely efficient. Only second in efficiency to Tokyo's metro, however it is MUCH simpler and easier to use than Tokyo's system.Proliferation: You can go pretty much anywhere you need to in Seoul via metro and if not, transfer to a bus. There is nowhere you can't go if you utilize the entire public transportation system in Seoul. Ease of use: With NFC cards and full English service, it's easy even for foreigners. You can even download an app and use that to pay if your phone supports NFC."
Easy to use,"All stops are announced in Korean, English, Japanese, and Chinese. The maps are easy to read if you have used subways before. They have names in Hangeul and in English/Hangeul romanization. "
1990?,"Infrequent English on the trains, and no free wifi -- like the vast majority of Korea. It is not the easiest system to navigate."
Very reliable,Very reliable and easy to use. Easy access to most tourist destinations. Train stations has maps and english signs.
Quick and easy way to get around Seoul,Seoul Metro is a quick and easy way to get around Seoul. A T-Money card is helpful for seamless entry and exit that costs 4k won via 7-11 for the card itself.Plenty of maps and English signs at the stations and trains were clean and functional.It was odd that there was quite a bit of pushing and shoving in Korea...Although it did feel safe..Not quite Japan safe...
You can get lost :D Take care!,When I went there have 9 line in 2016. Be careful and keep your eyes on subway map. Also learn a little bit Korean. 
"Convenient metro system, but not very good for senior or disabilities ","The metro system is very convenient. Broadcasting the station in Korean, English, Chinese, and Japanese. However, escalator or elevator is not in each station and exit. Actually, it is not many escalator at entrance or exit. Very hard for people who are not able to claim 2floor at one time. "
"Good way to get around, be prepared to walk some way","As an occasional user, this is a good way to get around. The network is very extensive. However, underground concourses can be very large so you can walk a long way between the various lines and platforms. Escalators are rather uncommon. Trains are often quite crowded and, if you need a priority seat, be sure they will all be occupied by fairly solid older people.The system is not very user-friendly for visitors and do not expect any help from locals (or the almost non-existent station staff) if you have a ticketing or any other problem.Compared regionally with Hong Kong's MTR and Singapore's MRT, both exceptionally good, this is a bigger but less efficient, less frequent and less user-friendly system for visitors.The single-ticket system requiring a 500 won deposit (you need to remember to get it refunded by machine each time) is very old-fashioned for such a tech-savvy nation."
Amazing Public transportation,"Seoul has an ever expanding network of subway lines it is amazing to say the least. Very easy to navigate without Korean. Language instructions are usually provided in Chinese, Japanese, Korean and English. The only bad thing is that it stops to run early 12:00 ish in the evening probably to help the rude taxi drivers get customers."
Easy access and Signs in English,When I travel I always use local transportation it cheap and convenient. These speed trains are fast and clean.
Very efficient,Loved how easy it is to get around Seoul with such an efficient and easily understandable metro system! Just be wary of older folk who'd push you aside when they get on or off the metro. Don't be too offended and just let it pass. 
Easy travel,"A very simple system that will take you all over Seoul. For a non-Korean speaker, this was still very simple!"
Super convenient,"They have single fare cards available in the station that require a (refundable) 500won deposit, but it would better to buy a rechargeable Tmoney card at a convenience store. That way you can take advantage of the transfer discount when switching buses or when going from bus to subway (and vice versa). The Tmoney card can also be used to pay taxi fares."
Really good way of transport,"We travelled around the city, but moving around taking a different transport got you always in a traffic jam, something that didn't affect the metro! At first was a little bit confusing, but when you get a hold of a t-money card, you just need to recharge it and go anywhere you want!"
"Best way to get around, hands down","The Seoul Metro is fast, cheap, clean, safe, and just the best way to get around Seoul. Get yourself a T-money and load it up so you don't have to fuss with paying fare everytime you take it. The T-money card is good on the metro and buses too."
Very safe ,"I made multiple trips on the Seoul metro and was quite happily surprised at how clean this metro is. Reloadable card is used on entry AND exit from the station so you are billed per distance. Very easy to reload the card. Machines have multiple languages, including English. Piece of cake. "
Too modern and clean ,"Well organized traffic that is not delayed. Very clean and tidy with a lot of information, and primarily safe. Perfectly marked so that it is easy to manage and to travel around the city on different lines."
A good alternative,Metro is wide spread in Seoul and you can reach everywhere. Trains are always on time and usually not overcrowded
Convenient and Affordable,"I love Seoul's subway system. It's amazing! The metro is a great for getting around Seoul (and Korea in general) especially during congested road traffic hours. It is very affordable compared to other cities metro lines coming in at about $1.50 per ride (distance depending). Furthermore, for travelers and foreigners there are many in depth subway apps that delve into train's arrival and departure, fastest transfer, least amount of transfer, multiple languages, etc. However, be wary of peak travel times because the most popular lines (1, 2, 4, 9) will be packed to the brim."
Awesome Seoul Metro,Timely and smooth running Korea underground. Make sure you get your T-Money card at the Incheon airport when purchasing your Airport Limousine Bus ticket to the city. The loaded card gives you full excess to the Metro. Machines has English selection too. Excess balance on T-Money can be refunded at any G25 store; Seoul's equivalent of the Seven Eleven convenience store. Metro is safe and clean. Peak hours are very crowded; early mornings and late evenings after work. Have taken the Metro from Myeongdong connecting to Nami Island; convenient 1 hr+ ride with 3 transfers.
Convenient transportation,"In my point of view Seoul transportation system is one of the best in the world, convenient and easy to get. U can go anywhere you want, even as a foreigner I didn't struggle that much since they provide English maps and all the directions inside the subways are in English and Chinese ( announcement in Japanese also).I lived here more than 7 months I enjoy taking transportation and looking around. There are of course hours to avoid since it gets very crowded but if it's the case then u can just wait for the next train since the waiting time is not that long."
Very easy to use system,It's good to buy a T-Money card which can be recharged and you can use it for convenience stores etc. as well.
So easy,So easy and convenient. Hard to get lost!!!But it would be better for u to avoid rush hour because its too packed. 
Perfect.,So easy to use ! Cheap and convenient. The best way to travel in Seoul. The best metro line we ever used.
Very Convenient and spacious,"This is my first time to come to Korea, and the metro service is just perfect. In comparison with other country, the carriage is more spacious and maintained very well."
Really easy to move around the city,"It was really clean and really easy to move around using the android mobile application. Most of the signs are written in English too, so it helped quite a lot."
Is this a metro or a hospital???,"So clean and neat that sometimes I thought I was at a hospital! The Seoul subway system is second to none compared to other main capitals, very efficient, on time and with free wifi in almost all of its stations!"
fantastic subway system,"Super user-friendly, efficient and clean. Everything is written in Korean and English. Every station has more than one exit so make sure you know which one will take you to where you are going. Also, there is an app ""Korea Subway"" (I think that's the name) - get it. It will make your life much easier. The subway is WIFI connected so you can follow the route on the app in the train. One thing to remember: you swipe your payment card both upon entry and exit. You can buy and refill the card at any convenience store and the stations also have self-serve automats."
Convenient,The best transportation mode while in seoul south korea.Very convenient when going to farther part of the South Korea.
Tips for using the metro,"It is really very well organized. I always get confused with which direction I should choose. Problem solved in Korea. All you have to do is to know which is the next metro station's name and look for it on top of the boarding doors of the metro. Over the doors it is always marked with appropriate arrows showing the direction of the previous and next stop. When inside look for a panel, usually in the middle of the wagon, that gives the names of the stop to come, in several languages. "
A little confusing compared to other metros,"A little confusing compared to other metros in Busan (Korea), Stockholm, and Paris. We could never find a portable metro map there in any language (funnily enough, I found a Seoul metro map in Busan, but it was too late), so print out a colored metro map of Seoul before you go."
Super Efficient Transportation,"Cheap, not affected by traffic jams, easy to navigate without knowing any Korean as long as you understand how public transportation works and have a color-coded map."
Very good,Very good. Almost every place we can reach with subway. Just some station need escalator instead of high stairs. Because it's very hard for us who bring a lot luggage
Who needs a car?,"Get a T-Money card to save money and you can turn it in for a refund at the end of your trip. About US$1 for each trip. The various lines seem to cover the city and you can transfer to a bus for free. Well done, Seoul!!!"
Express,Very good for take Tran from city to see countryside on the way .We have very good feeling and experience . 
Extensive train line,"Easy to navigate but too many steps while trying to get to train station. Okay thats because I am lazy, i don't like climbing stairs."
See Seoul with the Seoul Metro!,"Seoul's Metro is clean, fast and affordable. It is such an easy way to get around Seoul's bustling city.All you need to do is get a Metro card, then you can either pay per destination or top up an amount. Prices per trip were on average say $1 - $2. The ticket machines have English options, so just follow the prompts.Like all good metro systems, (Australia, you need to change your public transport!) there are dedicated train lines that come often, then to change lines you just change at an interchange stop. Maps are everywhere, easy to follow.Don't be daunted, use the Seoul Metro - highly recommended! The other cool perk is there are heaps of underground shopping hubs that connect the metro exits and sometimes connects to the next metro station. For us, it was a great way to escape the winter cold by crossing streets underground. "
Great transport system.,"Very affordable, easy to use, not overcrowded even in a city as huge as Seoul.Safe and easy to access."
Good,This is cheap and world best.suggest ride.this is safe .i lovd seoul metro.you will enjoy.there are sevreal metros all are nice and fun.
Extremely efficient,This was definitely a great subway system to have at hand on our two layovers. Very easy and very affordable!
Use the metro to get around Seoul,Make sure to buy your transport card T-card. Load at least KRW5000 for a day's trip. Download Seoul metro apps on your smart phone to check the directions.
Metro all the way,Such and easy metro to use and the coverage is great. We bought T-money cards for our 2 week visit and just topped them up with money as we needed. The trains are clean and the wait time is short. The only downside is they close at 11pm
Efficient transportation within Seoul,"Although not up to par with Japan's train system, Seoul Metro is an affordable and efficient means to visit different tourist areas in Seoul. I would have greatly appreciated it if there were train arrival/departure information displays or clear signages (in English) especially for elevators."
It's a subway,"I mean. It's a good subway but it's ust a subway. If you're pissed off with it, then take the bus? I mean then you have to deal with traffic, but whatever. You do you. "
GANG NAM to City center,"We took Sub way heading to city center (I Believe so) as our family intention to experience countdown 2016 to 2017.It is a cheap transport even on the New Year eve moment.3 stops to get us there , just a bit distance of walking though under zero, minus 4 degree Celcius. NO PROBLEMOThe route we use to get to comprehend through print brochure as a guide seem that because of its tiny letter, you won't be able to quickly recognize, under dim light in underground ..woo.. not easy task.. the youngster find it difficult.. the middle age like me find it easier ..WHY I ask my son to read the tube map for me...This Metro system during our only trip using it, has encountered trouble because of its sensor not functioning well enough, this cause time wasting for us to get back the refund...not only one lane/gate fail to tap but three..."
exit map,"all maps to reach various exits in each train station are well located and very helpful. at Incheon airport not so clear understand the difference (and platform) between ""all stations"" train and single fast train to Seoul center."
Clean and efficient,"Seoul has nine lines, making all of the city accessible by metro. The metros are clean and well signed in English. There are also many many helpers to point you in the right direction. Just know where the last stop of your line is and go in the right direction. There are escalators or flashing elevators for every flight of stairs so the mobility impaired can always find a way up and down. "
"Clean, Quick, Reliable",Whenever we travel to Seoul we always get around by the subway or we walk. The subway is generally around 1400 krw for a 1 way ticket by when you finish your route you get to put your ticket into a deposit machine and you get 500 krw back. Always reliable and never had a delay. The Seoul subway is good.
Easy to use,Don't be put off using the metro as the locals are very helpful if you seem lost. Watch out for all stations stops v's express trains.
Seoul Metro,Seoul Metro is excellent and cheapYou can easily call most anywhere by Metro in and around Seoulit's very clean and convenient
Crowded,"At some hours is impossible to get in! Still good system, easy to understand, fast and secure.The selling machine at the stations dies show the option but you can get a metro card for 30 days for 55.000krw (charge) +2.500 krw(plastic), it will give you 60 rides inside Seoul, only metro system, so no buses.. and you can buy it at the information points in the station."
Use it!,"Very easyPeople friendly when you first buy a card!Very fastCabs are not expensive, but traffic is really bad and subway so much faster"
Great way to move from A to B,Metro in Seoul is clean and a convenient way to move around. Can be recommended as an option to taxi and bus.
One of the cheapest and best public transportation systems in the world,"Not much needs to be said except this is very cheap transportation and great coverage of Seoul and its suburbs. The cost is between USD 1 and 1.50. The information is readily available in English, Chinese and at times, Japanese.The only bad thing to say is about transit from one subwaybline to another. It is not consistent, i.e. some cases the transit happens towards the end exit of the certain subway station while in ither cases, it is through the middle staircase exit. Need to pay attention.Enjoy the trip!"
It`s really easy and super clean.,Buy the T-Money Card or the smartphone accessory. You can easily top up the card and can also use it in busses.
Clean and easy,"one of the nicest subways I've used. Very clean, easy to read and extremely safe. Just be mindful of the entrance/exit used as some stations are quite large"
Very good and convenient transportation means.,"Except for the difficult to decipher Korea alphabets and words, the color scheme and well connected metro network is a good mean to travel around Seoul. Perhaps should have a 3-day or 1-week pass for visiting tourists."
Easy to use,"Great to use to get around - very easy to navigate! Most of the signs are in English as well. Only thing to note is that there are a lot of stairs, so isnt always suitable for a disabled user."
Well it is a Metro,Seoul Metro is easy to use with a T-Money Card if you want to use it often.You can get it at every convenient store like 7 Eleven or at the station.
Best way to get around Seoul,"Best way to get around Seoul. The metro should get you within walking distance of most of the places to visit in Seoul. Get a T-Money card at the station or from a convenience store. We loaded 10,000 Korean Won and this lasted us roughly 4 days of travel. The trips are very cheap. Tap on, even if the gate is open, otherwise it will charge you full amount for the whole line. Some stations can be a bit confusing but most are ok. Be warned there are a lot of stairs and also escalators. However, Seoul is also very access friendly, so you can find lifts if you can't take the stairs (or if you are tired after walking all day).There are english signs everywhere and on the train, there are indicators for which station is next in english.To work out which platform to go to, get a diagram of the entire metro, either from a printed map or online (google Seoul metro map). Line directions are indicated by the last station on that line. So for the light blue line, you are either heading to Danggogae direction, or Oido direction. This will help you work out which platform to stand on and also which signs to follow to get you there. Once on the platform, you can then confirm this because above the gates to the train it will show the previous station, the current station and the next station. Use this to double check you have the correct direction.I had a portable wifi hotspot that I had rented at the airport. So to get places, I would check google maps and find the closest metro station. On google maps, each metro line is a very distinct coloured line. Most of the time, wherever the coloured lines cross is where you can transfer to another line. Zoom in to check if there is a station nearby, even if the station isn't right at the intersection, you can transfer by walking. e.g. at Chungmuro station you can transfer between orange and light blue lines. Double check this on a metro map. Then you just work out which station is closest to you and work out which lines to catch and where to transfer to get to your destination.Once at your destination, use google maps again and zoom in on your station you are in. Once you have zoomed in, you can see exit numbers in google maps. Work out which exit suits you the most, then you can follow signs within the station to get to that exit. It's good to work this out straight away to save you walking the wrong way, some of the stations are huge."
Fast and Reliable!,Good subway system and very reliable. Download the Subway app to make it easier to see the fastest way to get to your destination/ the way that uses the fewest transfers. All the times on the app also seem very reliable.
good transport,"We used the subway several times during our stay. We got a T-money card and loaded with funds when we landed at the airport. You can get a refund on your remaining amount or spend it on convenience store food at the end of your Seoul trip. Plus, the T-money cards we had were really cute and made for great souvenirs. The subway has things well marked in English. I liked the numbered exits of the stations so that you knew where you were going upon subway exit. The maps in the subway cars were small, so it is helpful to know where you're going before you get in the car. There are signs on the subway platforms too though."
Very Clean,"The metro was very easy. Everything was colored coded which really helped us. There wasn't a lot in English, but with the color coding, it really helped."
So easy to use! ,"Found it so easy to use, better to get a card that can be topped up, also works for buses and taxi's. Makes transportation very convenient in Seoul!"
Best transport across Seoul!,"Definitely, the best way to travel across Seoul. The stations are very well marked and clearly show the directions to the connecting lines at intersections. All stations are clearly written English. Get a T-money card for faster clearances."
Clear signboards and instructions. Easy to roam around,Major Metro Stations equipped with escalator but some of the exits have long and knee breaking stairs. Good Exercise though! Encounter some problem when commuting but was quickly resolved by the station crews. A must do when visit Korea!
Ok,Sometimes a little hard to navigate but will get you places faster than a taxi or bus because of traffic.
Amazing subway!!!,"I was very,very surprised by the comfort and organization of the metro!It was very clean and functioned perfectly!"
most convinient to Travel in Seoul,"The best & convenient way to Travel around Seoul using Metro. It not only connects to all major shopping & business area of city, but special lines available for Airport as well."
Convenient and Simple,We went around Seoul using the metro and it was very convenient and the rail network is easy to understand. The transfers are not as complicated as in the trains in Japan so going around was a breeze.
Convenient transportation ,Quite clean but confusing for non Korean speaking / reading commuters. So familiar yourself before hand.
easy for getting around,it's a clean and fast opportunity to move from A to B. International signs and easy to travel with also for Europeans. Did buy a prepaid card with some Won of credit which was most easy to travel and access the terminals
Very convenient ,"Seoul metro provides easy access to all areas of the city. While can take time to get used to getting refund for each single ride ticket , the machines are conveniently located at every exit and they have English language menu. "
"Convenient, easy to use","Convenient, easy to use,Could be crowded in rush hours. Needto have have more Eng speaking staff in case of Emergency"
Good Transportation,"It's like any normal subway or MRT that transport you between places. It's just interesting because Seoul metro had been there for more than 100 years. The seats were comfortable but during busy hours, the subway will get crowded. Be careful of the rush hours as there will be a lot of people lining up. If you see that the subway is full, don't force yourself to get in there."
Good service,I found the metro service to be excellent an easy way to get round. Found our way easy there are plenty of officials around to ask if your not sure.
Easy and clean,"I bought a refundable transport card which is valid for all public transportation in Seoul, even for taxis. Top it up at machine with cash (it seems no cards are accepted for topping).Important: each time you step in or STEP OUT of public transport Do not forget to validate your card otherwise you will be charged maximum!Regular ride within Seoul costs around 1200-1500 krw (1$)."
Korean adventure,This is how we got around Seoul. Its a very efficient way to go to places of interest. I wish we had this in Manila. Very nice.
Easy to use and very effective way of transport ,Take the fact that it doesn't get stuck in traffic and gets you almost everywhere you desire. Add to is an affordable low price for one way trip and you get a very easy and convenient transport. During rush hour it can get too packed but this is expected. Generally the metro of Seoul is a great way to move around. 
Seoul Metro : good coverage,"Seoul metro covered a wide range of places, you can get anywhere with metro. You only need to remember the station number so you will not get wrong."
Trustful and clean to travellers,"Once the travellers have done some studies with the map of Metro, the system will take the travellers to everywhere within the city. The passengers in the car respect to each other. It provides a clean and peaceful environment to the travellers. Some stations have the English and Chinese indications besides Korea language."
Top transpo,"Metro is awesome. With the number of ppl here, that train is a blessing...or risk driving..make sure you get there on time.Trains won't wait and they shut down around 11 or 12 without warning so, if you're trying to get out to nightly events, plan accordingly...Lol"
Cheap & easy to navigate,"Seoul metro is cheap & easy-to-navigate. Everything is in English as well as Japanese (& naturally Korean). The only reason it's not getting 5/5 is that there are fewer interconnections than I'd like, given the scale of the city, and in comparison to the Tokyo metro network. "
Clean and comfortable,The comfort cooling works well and service is good. Very convenient for sightseeing the city. Well signposted. 
Changing line requires a good walk,Reserve more time if you're destination requires changing a few lines.Remember to get tickets refund before you buy a new one to avoid mixing them up.
Very easy to approach and connect to other lines! You can count on it!,Line Number 1 to Incheon was a huge surprise to me. The train we took was almost 8 minutes earlier than the arrival time given by the app. on smart phone. It is very unusual for me who is very used to train and metro system in Europe. Many times I have to deal with big delay. But not here!! Yeah!!
Great way to travel,"Accessible to tourist places, shopping etc by Metro. Very convenient, fast and efficient. love the shopping inside subway stations. cheap and nice "
Holiday ,The metro is very well connected to many places within Seoul. It was to manoeuvre within the various lines. Many stations were connected to the underground shopping Malls. 
Usefrul,"A lot of lines as Tokyo, many stations, especially, at the center of Seoul.Most of the detinations for sightseeing can be accesible by Seoul Metro.I bought the T CARD as soon as I arrived at Myondon Station at vending machine, no special requirement as ID card.Charge can be done by 1,000 won.Time is punctual, and trains were clean.Local Korean did not sit on seats for eldery and handicapped passengers,take care.Transition is sometimes rather incovenient as long walk and long stairs with no escalators.Signs are clear with alphabets.Line 9 operated express train.Trains inside were not noisy, but some sold small goods inside trains.Found shops in service on platforms.Line1 and 2,3, 4 particularly looked useful for tourists."
A very efficient and sprawling network,"In the last 15 years the number of lines more than doubled from 8 to 20. Since few years ago, airport is connected to the city by rail, though it doesn't help if you live in Kangnam - limousine buses are still better choices in this case.New lines primarily connect satellite cities to the centre. Kwacheon (where the bulk of the government is) used to be so far. No, considering much further suburbs are connected, it feels much closer.There are also new stations on existing lines, making the underground really the transit of choice.There is a surge in sensible English signage, including the language of automated ticket machines. The price for an average trip, including a 30 min transfer is ₩1,250."
Efficient ,You can go anywhere as they have good connection and efficient. Download their mobile app and use it to plan your trip. 
Best way to get around,They provide a T card or a single trip pass. Connects to all stations from Incheon Airport to different tourist sites up to Everland Theme Park. Although wifi connectivity is quite scarce.
Good Public Transportation,We spent a week in Seoul and used public transportation everywhere. The Metro system is easy to use even for non-Korean speaking folks like us!
"Tourist Friendly, Fast, Accessible almost everywhere in Seoul","I didn't have a hard time using the metro when I traveled solo in Seoul. The signs, map and the announcements is in different languages. The directions are also easy to follow and understand. The subway stations have a lot of exits which is pretty much easy to find everywhere. Down the station it has almost everything - food stalls, shopping, lockers, some are connected to a mall too. The tourist information inside is also helpful too. The T Money is used as payment for the the train and can also be used for taxis and buses. There's a lot of card loading and ticket vending machine in the subway stations.Seoul Metro is one of the things I like best in Korea."
Ridiculously cheap and accessible,"I've riden the metro in many cities including London, Toronto, and New York, and with no doubt, Seoul is by far number one. Whether you're a local or a tourist, you can get basically anywhere.First, go to the ticket booth (there's Korean, English, Chinese, Japanese all avaliable) and buy a one-way ticket. Make sure to press the second-to-left button and select where you want to go. It's usually only about 1300 won. If you have a child who is 12 or younger, it's only 450₩. 8 and under are free.If you have a T-money card (which is pretty transferring from bus to subway or vice versa, is completely free. You just have to pay once if you ride again within 30 minutes. Please note: you can't use this card to ride the bus. It only works for the subway.Also 500₩ is a deposit, so go to the deposit return device and you can get your 500₩ back. There are often beggars or people selling useless products on the subway, especially on line 1 and 2. Most of them are fake, so don't give them money. The subway itself is still clean and safe. Also, these days avoid riding the subway near Gwanghwamun on Saturday afternoon and evenings. Although it's not unsafe or anyting, the subway is crowded with people going to the protests against Park Geun Hye. Take line 3 to get to Apgujeong and Gyeongbokgung, and line 4 to get to Myeongdong. "
A Good Service,"The Seoul metro is well laid out and makes it easy to access most parts of the city quickly. There are a lot of lines though and it may take a bit of getting used to if you have not travelled in many large metros before. If you are going to be there for a couple of days, take advantage of the T card system. You can purchase them at most convenience stores and they are easier to charge and use than the regular ticket system. it does not take long to pay back the initial 2500 Won investment in the card as each ride is discounted. If you have cash left at the end of your trip, you can redeem it at machines located in each metro station."
"Fast, but confusing for some","Pros: Fast, on time, cleanCons: Confusing - Could be the names, or the seemingly conflicting signs, but it was confusing. Am not the first person to say this, but once you get the hang of it, it's very useful"
fast efficient and free wifi at stations,While free wifi free wifi is available at many locations in Seoul it is also useful to have it in the subway stations. this way is easier for coordination and making calls using the internet. I truly believe that free wifi makes a city friendly for the tourist and business traveller. 
Easy to get around and cheap ,We found the Seoul metro to be easy to use and cheap to get around. We arrived late and were jet lagged after a long flight so I was surprise it did not require much effort to navigate to find our destination or figure out how to pay. Recommend getting a T-Money card from the machines at the platforms and top up as required. There is also very good cellphone reception on the metro even below ground which is super helpful when planning your day or figuring out we're you're going to next.
Really easy to use,"It's ridiculous how clean, easy and cheap this is compared to my home countries underground.Definitely recommend using it to get about town."
Fast and Efficient,"This is a great way to get from one place to another in Seoul. The service is fast and pretty easy to use. Just make sure you plan your route and know where to transfer if needed.Most stations are underground and usually linked to another or more stations too. Follow the signs to your specific trains using the colours or numbers.For me, when in doubt, just follow the signs."
can take you anywhere in Seoul,Very simple and easy to use transportation to travel in the big city of Seoul. stations are close to all major tourist locations.
Spider web ,"Very well mapped outComplex. Serves many parts of the city. But once you get used to it, the system is great. However the transfer between stations is a trek. It is 5-8 minutes walk to transfer station. Be prepared to walk. "
Fast,"The station is perfect as trains it self If you going from city to city You have 3 choice 1. First class of course more expensive (free water , free wifi , phones on silent , seat more comfortable and bigger )2. Normal seat (cheaper ,free wifi ,phone in normal mode)3. Stand there's no seat with same price of normal seat .If want to go airport the best choice is express train .In Seoul metro station there's many shops , restaurants and coffee What I like there's a lockers for your luggage but not free and sometimes is full , I hope they will add more in future. In the end if you are sure book your tickets early to avoid any delay"
Reliable and Fast,The metro can be paid using Romney card which can be bought from their convinence stores. One down side is that there are no lifts within the station and all of the stations are underground. It's inconvinent for people who have trouble with stairs.
Excellent way to get around town,"Metro was great- clean and efficient. Stations were well marked, train lines were each to follow. Trains were air-conditioned. "
My Experiences of living in South Korea for 10 Years. (2002-2012),Seoul Subway System is awesome! Connects Seoul to Seoul wonderfully...watch the Rush-Hours times as they tend to get very crowded...and you have a delightful way to travel the City of Seoul and its environs. Many underground shopping centres can be reached with in the Subway System. Air Conditioned in the Summer Heat and Heated in the WInter Cold...most of the Korean People are approachable and friendly and it's hard to get lost...going to your destination...above ground is another story!
Does the job,"Wow, those trains are made up of many carriages, perhaps the longest I've seen. None of the stations I saw were impressive, unlike those I visited in Moscow or Kiev or Minsk. I was also a little surprised that the stations weren't deeper underground considering the situation with the North and the possible duel usage as bomb shelters. Or perhaps my imagination was running wild. Anyway, it's a subway system. Gets you from a to b - odd that it's a number one attraction on TA."
Easy to get around...but lots of walking and few elevators,"Used the metro a few times during our stay in Seoul. Prices are cheap and navigation is fairly simple. Facilities are clean and safe. Be prepared for lots of walking between lines and exits, plenty of escalators but noticed very few elevators. Could be a problem if you have a wheelchair or baby buggy...."
Easy to use.,"Grab a t-money card, load some money and go! The metro is very easy to use just follow the signs (most signs where in Korean, English, and Japanese). "
Super Easy,"I had a lot of doubts before coming to Seoul as this is our first visit to this K-Pop country. First you'll need a transit pass that you can purchase from the G-25 (7-Eleven version of Korea). They'll show few options, 5000, 3000, 2000 won. These transit cards are empty, meaning it doesn't have any prepaid value in it. So why the difference in pricing? If you look at the pass it has different pictures, the expensive ones usually has celebrity pictures on it. If you like it and want to keep it then get it. If you just need the pass the use the transit then get the cheap one. One you arrived down the subway go to the refill kiosk and you can buy prepaid from 1000, 3000, 5000 or 10000 won. I'd suggest you refill 10000 as you will ran out of prepaid very soon if you change station a lot."
Very systematic!,"This is my first time in Korea but I do not have any trouble to go anywhere by using their train. It's user friendly. The announcement was in Korean, Japanese & English. "
Travel safely and conveniently to many places,Helpful staff at the stations.Plenty of ticketing machines.Efficient.. convenient.. well connected!
Stay away from rush hour,Great way to see the city and get around. During rush hours the metro is crazy busy and uncomfortable to be traveling in. 
It's hard to get information for tourists,"The metro is good in terms of getting to places. However, when you arrive at the station itself, you'll realise that you're not sure which track to take, unless you study the map. Some stations provide a running map to tell you specifically the following stops, but these can only be found at the very popular stops. On board the train, the stop announcements are in Korean, some are in English and Mandarin. So it's be best to keep track of the number of stops."
World Quality,"The subway system in Seoul is great. Convenient, cheap, clean, and dependable. There are very few around the world that are better. "
Very easy and safe ,Got around very easily as Caucasian tourists - helpful gentleman assisted with ticket purchase also Clean as well 
Cheap and Convenient,It is cheap and convenient to travel by Seoul Metro. Will be better if there is more customer service personnel available to assist.
Affordable and convenient,"It's always fun to explore a city with affordable transportation option. Subway system in Soul is really convenient, however it requires lots of walking when you transfer to different subway line."
One of the best,Very easy to access all places. One of the best metros in the world. All stations have information desks and stations can be easily identified as they are written in english along with korean
"Well marked, easy to use, safe.",Seoul Metro is awesome! Buy the cards and put some money on them. The buses are color coordinated. The subway is also color coordinated. They go all over with several easy to use apps to help you get around. 
Fast but makes you furious,"This train is surprisingly fast. I was going to travel to and from train stations that looked very far from each other on the map, but the entire journey took me just a half an hour, which surprised me since I was under the assumption that Seoul was huge and my location and destination looked so far on the map that even with a car I might have taken the exact duration to reach my destination (Seoul's traffic is not exactly the best, I took a taxi once in a while.)The atmosphere is nice. The seats are comfy but not very spacious, especially coming here during winter where people are wearing their over-sized coats. It can get a little hot with you wearing your coat while the train's heater is on full power. There are also screens showing the station name in Korean, English and occasionally Mandarin and Japanese, along with an audio calling out station names and whether or not the station offers transfer services, which is really helpful if you weren't paying attention during the ride and accidentally missed your stop.The thing about the train is that it is rare to find it considerably empty unless you are at a less popular station. Most of the time the train is crowded, by which there is the 'floor is clear but all the seats are taken up' crowded or 'OMG I need to fight for air' crowded. And if you think I'm exaggerating, there were a couple of times where my family and I were felt like we were sardines in a can. We were squeezed so badly, that it was becoming ridiculous. It was like a human stampede with the constant pushing, pulling and tugging with passengers constantly moving in and out because they wanted to get on and off the different stations. This is made worse by the fact that the commuters here, especially the elder men (and in one instance, a very rude young woman who, to top it off, stole a seat from my grandmother while she was reaching out to grab the seat first), are pretty rough. Unlike places like Japan and even in my home country, the word 'excuse me' is at least heard once in the train station from someone trying to get through the flood of commuters. But here, not once did I hear anyone politely asking me to move aside, and people here mostly just harshly shove their way through. This isn't true for everyone here (lest I unintentionally insult someone), but whenever I did take the train, multiple pushes are definitely inevitable. My mother even reacted by loudly shouting an 'oui' to one pusher, whom definitely did not even turn his back. I know it might not seem like a big deal there but to my parents they were really holding back their anger (especially since my grandmother was pretty old but she kept enduring harsh pushes and got her seat stolen from her once). It is one of the many culture-shocks that I have experienced in Korea. It wasn't pleasant, but fortunately we have just got through the biggest reason why the Seoul Metro was horrible to me.Other annoyances includes the enormous train station (especially those with many connecting lines) and the lack of help to get you around it. The elevators are extremely hidden and are very, very, very slow. I had to push the close button a 100 times before the doors actually close. There are many flights of stairs that are extremely high for some reason, wearing you out faster, There are many escalators of course, but not enough. I still had to climb up a multitude of high stairs. The travelators either don't work or were off so we can't use it. Overall it is very tiring to make your way from one line to another.Also, there are other things I have to give credit for. The trains are well labelled and it makes sure you do not get on the wrong train. There are many signs in the station that properly help guide you towards your chosen exit. It would have been better if the televisions give you an estimate on when the train is coming (maybe they did but it was in Korean so I have no idea what it is saying.)Actually, as I mentioned before, when in the train there is an audio telling you whether the station offers you transfers. However, when I was on my way to Myeongil station, the purple line splits into 2 at Gangdong station, and while I was on my train towards Gangdong, the audio did not tell me whether the station offers transfer services, so I was pretty confused and scared. Thank god it went towards Myeongil.The train here is impressive for it's speed and it's friendliness towards us tourists who do not speak Korean, but I wish I was able to get around the stations with better ease, as well as giving my old grandmother here a better time. I also wished the train and stations here could have had lesser people, especially rude ones that I had to put up with."
Seoul Metro,"As a first timer visiting Seoul, I find that it is one of the best subway systems I ever seen. The down side is that there is no escalators in most of the stations, and the lifts are moving so slowly. Please be prepared to trek the subway stations if you are going to Seoul"
Efficient and cheap,Get the card. It's like oyster. You have to buy the card and load it. Don't overload or you will lose what you don't use. Easy to recharge at a machine
Cheap easy informative everywhere!,I have watched Seouls subways since the early 90's. Then there were 3 lines. Now there are 17+ and buses everywhere. All announcements in English Chinese Japanese. A tourist can get around return trip for around $5 to the city or use Tmoney card. Best in North Asia for sure. 
Good transport choice,The stops are almost cover areas in Seoul Train is quite clean and underground stations also have many shopping place
Remarkably easy ,"As an Australian abroad I am always impressed by well organized and effective train systems. We easily found our way from the airport to the city, with a change along the way, and back again. All signage is in Korean and English and you can easily monitor your progress along the way through the displays on board. The stations are clean and so were the carriages. A good experience all round. "
"Fast, Efficient and Spacious","Alright, all metros need to be fast and efficient, but the widths of the train cars are unusually wider than most train cars found in the west! Getting one-way and round-trip tickets are extremely quick and easy (and so is getting your refund after each trip)! Plus the scope of the rail lines is vast!"
Fast and efficient but many stairs,"Fast and efficient but be prepared to climb alot of stairs! Will be better if Stations are equipped with escalators. After a full day tour/walks, I dragged to climb the stairs with my sore legs and heavy shopping bags. "
efficient metro,"the metro system was easy to use. Clean and spacious. Fast. Affordable. I did have help from someone who lives in Seoul, so this may influence why I found it easy to get around. "
Easy and convenient Seoul public transit,"Most announcements and signs are bilingual (Korean/English). And once you figure out the basics it is easy to use, not too mention faster than taxis 90% of the time. Anyone noticed how bad Seoul traffic is these days?"
Great Subway,The Seoul subway network is complicated but very well coloured and numbered. There is English signage and its very efficient system are covers a great part of Seoul. 
Good means of transportation,Overall don't expect too much but it's cheap to travel . Avoid office hours as it can be very crowded. And yeah be careful With your belongings as it may gets stolen if not been careful. 
easy to navigate,"Its fast, clean and easy to navigate. Its also the cheapest way to get around the huge city. Download the app and that will asist you with the fastest routes and the time it will take you to travel from place to place"
Metro,Great to get around. More complex that Tub in London or Beijing. Lots of steps so find the hidden elevators
Dependable ride!,It's a very practical way to go around Seoul. You can just go about anywhere with it. Just make sure you have a map and schedule. Also it helps f you study the different options just in case you miss a ride.
Too many stairs for elderly people,"Each stations with many exit, but not every exit have elevator, elderly people need to walk too much stairs to go up to the group floor. But its good that its easy to access toilet facilities.As I were a tourist, when I drop off the wrong station and want to go back to the fore station, I dont know how to go, seems I have to exit and entrance to opposite line."
Clean modern and easy to sue metro,"Seoul's subway is as good as it gets. There are numerous liens taking you anywhere you need to go in the city. Its also connected to the major train, rail and airports. Its clean, efficient and easy to use with English readily available. "
"Clean subways, language a bit difficult.","Airconditioned, clean, a bit difficult to find the proper stations in Korean and English. A taxi might be easier."
Its covinient and well connected,"Seoul metro is a great way to go around. Well connected and clean. One things, needed more sign in english langguage."
"Fast, clean and easy to navigate",I was only in Seoul for a couple of days and this was ideal for me to explore quickly. Everywhere was clean and there were announcements in English. Although it was always busy the trains were very frequent and didn't feel crowded. I used my T-card which was easy to top up and I felt completely safe travelling by myself.
Unbelievably Helpful!!,"Maybe I was just really lucky, but on Saturday, with all the city in turmoil with President Park being impeached and crazy busy traffic, I hit the jackpot. The lady at the information desk spoke great English and went out of her way to help me find Subway line #4, buy a ticket and be able to make a transfer to the #3line. Was I grateful!!"
Best mode of transport,"Probably the best way to get around. The metro covers a very large part of seoul. It is efficient, both from time as finance perspective. It is not always clear where to enter, as seoul has many underground shops. Look for stairway entrances with colorful dots with numbers on them."
Great system but....,The system like in many other countries is great. The carts are spacious and very clean. The only real negative is that the latest train departs at about 23.45. This makes it hard to go out with friends or to explore the city.
very easy easy to explore Seoul.,It is the best way to explore Seoul. You should get a T Money card and recharge from the machine. Really easy to navigate. All exists are number at each station. 
Cheaper by taxi,The cost of taking a taxi for short distance say up to 5km is comparable if you have several people. Suggest taxi over metro as there is a lot of walking if connecting different metro lines. Suggest you have Korean written place before flagging down one as most do not speak English.
Very convenient,"You can go everywhere just by using this metro. Very convenient and easy to use, not very cheap though. Almost every attraction in the city can be reached by seoul metro, even to nami island where you have to hop off in gapyeong station."
Download the app as guide,"Seoul's train system is very clean, efficient and safe. For me it's the best in Asia. Lots of shops underground. What made commuting easier for us to travel by train is Soul's train app by Mapway. "
Best :),"The subway is super easy to use! There are maps everywhere.It is also super cheap! I would recommend that you buy a T-money card to save money. I would also say that it is polite to give up your seat to an elderly person if you see one. They also have bike racks if you are want to bring your bike on. Travel is comfortable when you can sit and it is very convenient. Buying the 'tickets' (really you only take away money from your card or rent a card) is also easy and you can select the English if needed. I was able to travel from Chuncheon to Seoul many times using this transportation. Would definitely recommend especially since they have tolls for cars in Korea. I only had trouble with the 'tickets' once, but I quickly got help by asking the man at the help desk."
"Clean, fast, easy to use",Get a T-money card at the 7-11 at the airport (or anywhere else in Seoul) and use the Metro to get around. Trains all have illuminated signs that include an English version so it's not hard to tell where you are and when to get on and off.Some lines have express and local trains -- the expresses are a lot faster and worth waiting for if your destination is also an express stop.
Pretty easy in English.,"English on the signs, the speakers, and the ticketing machines. Overall very pleasant and easy to use. Reasonably clean too, just don't go down there after it closes!"
cleanest and easiest metro to use,"for 5 years I had no car and could enjoy what real public transportation means.Never failing me, always working and clean. pure joy to ride."
Clean and easy to use,The Metro in Seoul is very clean and easy to use. Google Maps will help you as well! Never felt unsafe either. 
"very useful, specially if traveling alone",Its a huge system and very convenient too. Well connected and cheap. Just get a map from your hotel or the airport and purchase the T-card from the many convenience stores that sell it.
easy and convienience,"fast and good to reach any place in seoul. plus there are many trains for each few minutes,so u dont have to worry much iftrain is full"
Great system,"We purchased tickets in the subway after sine help from a local. Easy to purchase, but the English translations and directions were a bit confusing. Once that was out if the way, it was very easy to navigate. Be sure to hold onto your subway card if it is a one time use card. You will need it to exit the subway area and can turn it in at a machine near the card purchase for a refund of your deposit that is automatically included when you purchase it. Our son had his card deactivate twice and would not allow the turnstile to work, but the workers in the subway area and help desk were great and able to get us out in no time. "
Good Coverage Around the City,"The Metro has a good coverage around the city and even to the airports. The only problem is that is hard to find your location since everything is written in Korean and the English is almost nowhere. Therefore, you may need some assistance "
Very convenient!,"Very convenient! No problem to use, even if you don't know Korean. Only problem I had is that the maps showing the area around the stations do not have north pointing up. It once took me some time to figure out that."
"Fast, affordable, efficient","Very punctual except subways that share the rail lines which sometimes experience delays. Quite clean. Once on board have Korean, Chinese and English signage and voice notifications of stops. Signage is spotty depending on which stop you're at. Get a subway app which makes journey planning very easy. Beware subways that share train lines as the platform numbers are not listed on the apps. During rush hour some people will block entrances and push to get on as you're trying to exit. Keep children close!"
Good way to get around seoul,"If you're looking to burn calories, this is one way to go. Watch out for steep stairways and can get very crowded at peak times. Good to purchase the relaod card (T-money) as you won't hv to keep purchasing tickets anywhere you want to go."
Efficient and cheap,I have travelled the world and this metro is the cleanest and most effective I have seen. The only challence is that for European it is sometimes difficult to follow the signs but the people are so kind to stop and help even if their English skills are limited.
Great way to move around seoul,"Quite easy to understand, english names are all over, tickets you can buy on machines and the base cost is 1350 won for normal ride, on top you pay 500 won deposit which you get back when you return the card (automated machine). Did not fully understand how far you can go with the base cost, for sure it works for 5-6 stations, we did once 18 stations and then had to pay a extra 100 won, on the other hand did once 9 stations and got stuck.They do have a daily pass for 10.000 won but that you can buy only at some main stations but i must say a lot of the attractions are in the center and you can walk to them. The metro is clean, and trains seem to me quite often but can get quite crowded"
Quicker transfer cheatsheet,"On the glass divider between the platform, they will have ""quick transfer"" map aside from the regular subway map. From this map you can find out which carriage is the closest to the line you intend to transfer. Get in that carriage, which is neatly numbered."
"Quick, clean, cheap and safe.","Everything you need from a metro: it's easy to use, everything is indicated in English, it's cheap, the frequency is high and it is clean (toilets are clean!). The T-money card is easy to use (you can also use it to pay the taxi)."
Convenient transportation,I love the thought of the accessibility of the tourist attractions from the train stations. This is a convenient way to explore Seoul.
Cheap Efficient transportation ,"The first day I arrived i had some difficulties in understanding their subway system, but by the second day i became an expert.It's so efficient well connected and on time.The con about it is that it has a lot of stairs which can be a bit tiring after walking the whole day.The price is so cheap."
No problem with T-money card,"Want to use the metro in Seoul or Busan? - Buy a 'T-money card' at the 7-elven shop or similar in the metro station. I think the card costs 3000 won and then you can put some money on it. The person in the shop will understand when you say 'T-moeny card'. You can use the card and the system automatically takes off money from the card once you leave the metro. Each time you use the card the display shows how much money is left. In case you have a problem when going out the metro (barrier) there is a side door with a button which will open and you can go out.In Seoul each person needs its own card. In Busan two of us were able to go with one card. You need a map to be sure to take the right directions. Not always that clear. You can ask people, they are very helpful and polite."
Best way to get around,"We get to most attractions easily by using the metro. With the T-money, taking the metro becomes a breeze."
Sometimes hard for foreigners,"The airport subway is OK. But the city subway is quite hard for me to use at first. The English announcement is too quiet, compared with the noise from all people on the subway at the same time. And it doesn't have the signal to show which station is next --> Singaporean subway is better at this point."
"Clean, cheap and convenient","It is very easy to understand, the price is cheap taking into account it's efficiency and good condition. Underground there are also many services: stores, restaurants, toilet, coffee shops...The best option to move in Seoul.It is very convenient to use cards to pay, which can be use also to pay in many stores, restaurants..."
Annual Visit to Seoul,"Seoul metro is usually crowded during weekdays. So, I try to use it on the weekend only. Just too many people, not enough air-conditioning system,"
"Easy, handy and clean","It's very easy to use the metro in Seoul. No need for cabs. We did have a local with us which probably made it easier. Unfortunately, it did not appear to be very user friendly for anyone with a disability so be aware of that."
Modern metro,"Its very modern, very clean people in South Korea it's very friendly, they have a nice transportation "
Efficient and cheap,Easy to use and cheap way to get around. Very efficient and quick. However many stops have really steep steps going up so it was a little difficult for my mom who is 60.
Super Convenient and easy to navigate,"Bring your most comfortable shoes and be prepared to do A LOT of walking (esp. stairs). Even though I was eating 3 times more than usual, I was able to lose some weight with this amount of exercise. I printed out a metro map in hardcopy and also downloaded the Subway app and was able to go to different places just fine. Respect the local culture (subway is pretty crowded, esp. during peak hours but still fairly quiet with everyone focusing on their smartphone, give seat to elderly/injured and don't sit on priority seating)"
"Very new, very organized",City dwellers on 3 occasion help this foreigner navigate. Felt totally safe at all hours using the public transportation.
Great subway system ,"The Seoul area subway goes everywhere. And, very importantly, it was easy for this English (only) speaking visitor to navigate. In fact it helped me in my walking travels of the city because, even though I could not understand some street maps, if I was near a subway stop I could always get my locational bearings. Bonus- subway bathrooms are very clean. I would have given it a five except it is miserably crowded at rush hour - avoid rush hours if you can. "
Convenient,"Easy and save money, can reach any destination you plan to.. Information counter anyway.. Helpful..."
Good service,"Good service, on time. Easily access many places in seoul. Tourist friendly as they have english directory and guidance"
Easy to find your way,The metro in Seoul makes it easy for you to find your way in the city.The connection with the airports is great and inexpensive.Definitely a good choice to go around Seoul.
"Great metro, which an be easily used by foreigners","The metro in Seoul is a good, cheap and an easy way to get around.It is much easier to navigate then the public transport system in Japan for example.It can be busy during rush hour like any public transport in Asia, but even then it is still not totally overcrowded."
Every day trip to work and back home.,"Well. Among all types of Korean transport, metro is the perfect choice.1. Clean2. Safe 3. Quiet 4. Excellent solution if it's traffic jam in rush hour. 5. Modern I recommend you to use it any time"
Why wouldn't you use it?,"When my wife and I lived in Seoul twenty years ago we almost exclusively used the subway to get around and thought it was great. When we returned for a visit recently, we found it to be even better. The subway can get you within less than a half mile of pretty much anything in the metro-Seoul area. From there, it's easy enough to walk or take a taxi the rest of the way. "
Nice ,In general its nice and perfect. But my main problem was buying they tickets since they dont accept credit card and also should be a small cash.All in all nice
Best way to travel in Seoul,"Even if the network is huge and very complex, it is easy to understand how to travel and switch lines. It is the best way to travel in Seoul. Do not underestimate the time and distances. Sometimes it took me 1h-1,5h to travel from one point to another. Seoul is huge."
Very convenient and reasonable,"Taking the metro was much easier than anticipated. Using the subway app to pre check route helped a lot. The card vending machines are immediately visible as you enter. They are very easy to use with directions in English. Trains and routes are clearly marked in multiple languages including English. The announcements on the subway are also in English. When in doubt, you can ask for help. We generally approach a young adult in business attire as they generally know some English. Make sure to know your proper exit as soon as you leave the train. Exits can be up to half mile apart. Avoid the metro at rush hour if you can."
Accessible,Access to and from anywhere in Seoul is excellent and cheap. The timings are shown and exact.The stations have shops with a lot of cheap shopping choices.
Waiting time can be improved,"Seoul Metro has a wide network of lines and stations. Waiting time for trains can be improved, especially during peak periods."
Seoul train.,One of the finest transit experiences in the world. Pockets of underground shopping can be found as well. Not too difficult to get hang of. Followed directions from Korea visitor information site. Only wish you could reload the single journey travel card.
Best mode of transport around Seoul,"The metro system in Seoul is very extensive and you can go almost anywhere you want to go to just by taking the subway. It is clean, cheap and convenient! Be sure to get T-money card as it saves the hassle of buying tickets and the fare is cheaper!"
Easy to go everywhere,"I could say the transportation in Seoul is the best. You can go everywhere you want to go. Last time i went for shopping at hongik and i stayed in chungmuro station. It's far from each station actually. And it was late night as it was last train, i was taking so i have to change to another line but i decided to get off at euijiro3ga station and thinking about take taxi at 12.30am but u know what after i go up from the subway i saw the big direction way 'chungmuro' so i and my sister decided to walk and yay it's just 5-10mins walking. So this prove that seoul subway cover everywhere. You can walk from this station to next station and it's the best transportation ive ever tried "
Makes travelling around Seoul so easy ,Make sure to buy a T money for easier travelling... you can buy and loaad money in any convenience store...
amazing,"This is first time I use metro and I feel overwhelmed with the subway system in Seoul. It's not difficult as i think. You need check your nearest subway station, your next destination will you come and use ""google map"" or ""subway korea"" app. Our friends said that the seoul metro is different elsewhere in the world. You only care which line subway you have to go, your current location and next station or the end metro station off this line, you can go anywhere and don't worry about going in the opposite train which everyone often make this mistake. I even used metro to get to incheon Airport. The experience you should try when you come to Seoul :)"
quite handy,easy to follow ticket machine and easy transfer from one line to another one. Lots of underground shopping area usually associated with the Metro system. 
Great option,Very convenient option of transport. The metro connects the city in so many lines and stations. It was a perfect option to go to many different tourist attractions. Super recommended 
My favorite way to get around Seoul,"Every time I travel to Seoul I load up my TMoney card and just take the metro to get everywhere. Some of the stations are nicer than others and easier to figure out (the many exit points), but overall it's better than in other cities where I have taken the metro. "
Clean and so easy to use - just what travelers want!,"I have used the metro in many major cities but the one in Seoul really stands out.It is easy to use, punctual, has good signage and audio once you're on board and is very clean. There are lots of ticket machines at every station with an easy to see <English> button if you don't speak Korean. There are EXPRESS trains as well so you can get to your destination fast - check to be sure your stop is on the express route - the EXPRESS map is posted at the station.If you are anxious about using the metro - don't be. The Korean people are SO helpful and will give you any needed advice if you are hesitant."
Get an app before riding it!,"The Seould Metro is very efficient and cheap. Get a smart phone application, get a rechargeable card and go wherever you want to go in Seoul. About a US$5 charge is enough for one day of constant moving. Refill as needed (most stations have automatic machines that do this in several languages). There is no need to know how to use it as is self evident. I went to Seoul for the first time, arrived past midnight at Gimpo Airport. Bus service to downtown was finished. But the Metro saved me. Even I found a space where to put my luggage in there. If you have to cross from one bank to the other over the Han River, this is the way to go. "
Great way to go around!,"This system can take you anywhere in Seoul! There are so many lines, crisscrossing; so would be better if you get a metro map before you travel. Highly recommend to get a T-money card, as you can also top it up at machines in stations of the metro all by yourself."
very convenience,"I went to Seoul 3 times already, we go out by train most of time. Seoul's train is very on time, so we can follow our travel plan complete. And there are not too much people, we can have a seat most of time, it is very important to us because we always go out in the morning and back to the hotel at night, it is very tired if we don't get a seat to relax our leg. and Seoul's train is very convenience, most of places we need to go is very near the train stop. The seoul's train can arrive a lot of place, so it is the reason of why we can go out by the train most of time. Although there are so many stop, it is not very complicated to find which train line we should ride, because you can download the seoul train app on your phone, and plan the line before you go out."
Easy and pretty lit subway system,"The coolest thing about the Subway Metro for foreigners visiting Seoul is that you will never get lost because everything has English translations. Although it's a nice thing that you could understand Korean.Amazed by the fact that you could transfer to several subway lines within the platform. But requires a lot of walking which was nice. Sometimes when you get to a station where there are two separate platforms for one line, it can get confusing. Overall, it is very easy to follow and is a convenient transportation when going out and about places in Seoul (even outside Seoul!)"
"Easy to buy, navigate and ride","Don't fear the Seoul Metro. Embrace it and get close and personal with thousands of other travelers. The vending machines display clear instructions in English and it is easy to find your fare depending on where you want to go. I recommend saving a jpg or pdf of the Seoul metro system on your phone before going. This makes it easy to find the stops. And if you are looking at your phone (instead of a map), you will look like everyone else riding on the metro!"
Sensational Subway,"The train service in Seoul seemed daunting, as I do not speak the language, however I mastered the best way to travel very quickly.All stops are translated into English and as long as you are aware of what stops are along the way, you cannot go wrong. It's very cheap and I even caught the train back to the Airport on my way home....Perfect!"
The best way to move around.,"Download a smart phone app if possible. I had no time on my first time to Seoul to ride from Gimpo Airport to downtown without asking how to do it. Got to the nearest metro station (they run pretty late), got a metro card, put some value in it, and rode the train. The system is efficient and cheap (compared to Tokyo, at least). This is a convenient way to cross the Han River. Stations are well signed in Hangeul (Korean), English, Japanese and Chinese. The app will help you to do the changes from line to line. Stations are easily recognizable at ground level. Down in there, they are spacious, well connected to shopping areas, points of interest, and so; some even have exhibits. One thing that I noticed was that many people talk on their phones while riding. Nothing that bothers me, but..."
Very good train service,"Great train service. On time, clean and no worries whether you are traveling around the city; to or from the airport or between Incheon and Gimpo airports.Take time to study their network as it is quite extensive."
Solo in Seoul ,"The subway system is easy to follow, so many lines it can get confusing from time to time. Follow the signs on the wall and arrows on the floor."
Easy subway system,"The second day I was in Seoul I used the Metro to get around the city. It is very user-friendly and very economical. The lines go by both numbers and colour and once you know the connecting points, it's a breeze to get around the city. I feel very safe travelling by the Seoul Metro and managed to get to a few tourist sites. I definitely recommend it."
Busy and crowded,Buy a T card and can use for certain metro line. Quite confusing is you never plan early anyway still able get direction. Please be prepare as it will be crowded. 
Best underground metro link I have ever seen,"Seoul metro is well connected with all the major attractions, business centers and residential zones along with Incheon airport link. You can either purchase one way ticket everytime or a multiple travel card. Economical when compared with Buses and language friendly"
The Seoul Metro,"The metro plannning is intuitive and exhaustive - so practically, I did not have to rely on any other mode of transport. The number 9 line on the south of the Hans river is new, I think, and cleaner than the lines 4,5 on the north of the river. But the stations and the trains are way cleaner than their counterparts in other big cities. The announcements are made in Korean and English - so at no point in time, did I feel lost. Its a very well planned and laid out underground."
Fast and easy to use !!,"Trust me, with T-money you will go everywhere around Seoul ( and Nami Island ).We enjoyed the train travels because very easy to use, felt very safe."
"In general, clean and efficient but could be improved","Overall, it is one of the best subway systems in the world. The stations and cars (both subway cars and buses) are clean, they generally run on-time, and it is fairly easy to navigate the system.However, there are a few things it could improve, especially for people who are only fluent in English (yeah, that's a bit selfish):- Some subway stations and bus stops should be announced in English as well as Korean- Some subway stations do not have elevators- There was actually a subway station that really, really stunk...- The majority of bus stops do not indicate the arrival time of the next busA tip - even though Google Maps does not fully work (does not work with walking directions or driving directions) in South Korea, it does work with public transport directions! The problem is that Naver Maps and the other officially sanctioned Maps apps only work in Korean."
Easy,Easy to use. Fast and efficient. Buy a card-- charge it and go. Assistance is always available-- use the button on the machine.
Very Extensive,Very extensive metro system that is quick & fairly easy to use (helps that we already used Hong Kong's and Singapore's on this trip).
Cleanest metro I've ever used. Outstanding,"Very easy to use, super clean. Felt very safe. Travel to and from ICN and all around the city. Used the card which was purchased in the airport. "
"Reliable, easy to use and value for money","In our visits to seoul, we've never had a reason to drive around except when we were in Jeju. This is because the city transport system is simply great and easy to use. The metros are marked with some english and chinese characters along with korean as well for easy navigation and is wonderfully intricate and full of interesting little details in the metro. It is extremely clean and fast and also well maintained at all times. The metro is linked by lots of underground tunnels to many places you're going to and its all well lit.The only complaint is that the metros all require a certain level of fitness to navigate as the main method of moving up or down the metro to the ground level is the staircases. Hence, the main issue is if you travel with luggage, it means you'll either have to search for the rare lifts or escalators or you'll need to lug it all the way to whereever you're going to. Otherwise, very convenient and a great way to travel around seoul."
Efficient transport,The metro allows to buy tickets cards with a deposit of 500 won that are refunded when you leave the station. 
A modern and easy to use,Seoul metro is modern and very easy to use. all information is in Korean and English. please note that the fare includes deposit that can be claimed at the automatic machines at the exit.
Super easy to nagivate,"User friendly, clear directions, easy to fill metro cards. Seoul has one of the best transportation systems in the world. I didn't use any other transportation my whole trip."
Hassle Free Traveling,"The Seoul metro is efficient, punctual, services all sectors of the city, is safe and spotlessly clean."
City tour,"see the city views , Gwanghwanum PAlace, Insadong, Gyeokbokgung , Korea history, Namdaenum market, Dongdaenum Market, Coex Mall, Seoul Station, we also shop at Myeongdong. we also travelled myeongdong to Gapyeong station with several transfels, we enjoyed the train travels its like an adventure to us."
one of the transportation mode to commune around in seoul,"Although its kinda the best transportation mode to go around in seoul for tourists. however, i would suggest taking bus would be much better as you can avoid the massive staircase within the metro building..."
Fast and easy to use.,We travelled after 9am and found the trains to be fast and there were plenty of people offering to help with getting tickets and directions.
Perfect for moving around Seoul,This metro can take you anywhere. Everything is very clear and tourist friendly. Very clean and locals take care of it. Tickets when used are recycled and you get a deposit back. 
Access to all major tourist areas,easy to access all major tourist areas. better to take subway in Seoul to make your travelling time in control.
One of the best Metro Systems in the region,"Download Korean Subway app on your smartphone and you are good to go anywhere in Seoul. It fast, quick and well connected to all the major tourist attractions and business areas. Your data internet will work even in the subway. One of the best connectivity in the world. "
Delay and frequency low,In my opinion frequency of train is too low and loudspeaker only in Korean doesn't help foreigner to understand situation on delay or time of departure of next train. We waited 25 minutes for the train to arrive......
World-best public trasprtation,"I've been to more than 30 countries so far but Seoul metro is the best public transportation in terms of accessibility, proximity and price. Please bring it on if you have something better! "
Seoul metro meets all expectations of good public transport,"Efficient, easy to read instructions in English, mandarin and Japanese as well as Korean. Audio instructions are also. It's clean, punctual and you can get everywhere you want. The bus system links metros as well. It can be a squash at peak times but that's all part of the fun. It's one of the cheapest high quality transport systems I've used."
Modern and easy to Navigate.,"Used the Metro to get from Incheon Airport to Hotel in Seoul and also to visit various areas. Easy to access, safe, clean and relatively inexpensive. Tip: Get a T-Money card to use with the Metro system."
Great way to travel around Seoul,"The trains are very well connected. There are signs in English. Buying a ticket for the first time can be quite an experience - because it's just vending machines. We were lucky to stop a kind student (and in Korea, you always meet very kind and helpful people) who knew enough English to help us buy our first tickets. We did realise later that there are machines that have English as a choice. Don't worry about the deposit for your ticket, once you have reached your destination, put in the ticket at a refund machine and you will get your money back.As in any metropolitan, it is best to avoid rush hour. There are plenty of things in the subway station - food and shopping too!Be ready to walk a long way to your exit (it is best you know which exit you want to head to) esp in the large stations."
Hard to manipulate Seoul's metro,"For short distances in Seoul, I would recommend a taxi. Taxi is easily available and cheap. We tried the metro. If you do not read Korean, when you look at the Metro Map, the English is tiny, whereas the Korean is big. There are many lines, crisscrossing. The metro is not that cheap for short distances. Compared to Hong Kong, Singapore, Shanghai, Beijing metro, Seoul metro is very average."
not friedly,Station is much bigger and need time to use to without get lose! A lots walking between transfers and may not have lift and certainly no one will tell you where is elevator!
Not suggested for traveller who is not able to walk for long time,Most of entrances to/from subway doesn't provide escalators or elevator. You must walk ups and downs through staircase! Which one of my feet was under recovery and was really an headache to get in or out from the subway!The subway company has to do some improvements as I saw lot of elderly (specially those old ladies) were hard to move step by step from underground to street level!It may be the reason why only the young passengers select to take Subway in Seoul!
Do not travel in the morning!,"Yes, the subway is very convenient for travelers but I do recommend using it a little bit after 10 AM and in the afternoon except from 5 PM to 7PM. Riding the subway can be very intense for some because people are pushing you in all directions and it is very easy to get injured or really get pissed off at the locals. People are in a hurry especially in the morning because they are all trying to get to work. It's worse than New York/Tokyo crowds. The appearance of the subway system is very clean and modern but wow! For the people, they really need to practice patience. It is not okay to push people around and never say, ""I am sorry"" or excuse me! So sad! Very disappointed. This hurts the society and the people's mental state. There is no regards what-so-ever! And we really hated the plastic surgery adds and very provocative posters of game characters! If Seoul is that great of a city that the people boast of, it needs serious improvement! Please, we can do better!"
Easy Acces,Easy to travel with subway by T-Money.. instruction is easy to understand. Staff are very helpful. you gave to try using subways
Reliable service,"Although trains shut down at 12 no matter where you are, the trains were always on time which is what you can only hope for as well as being clean. The only issue i had was there should be more lines that connect from places like hongdae to gangnam as it takes 40 minutes around green line to get there, but these are.minor quibbles"
Perfect,"Vast network. It will take you virtually anywhere in Seoul. Tickets are available in kiosks in form of plastic cards. Single trip within the city is c.a. 3,5-4K WON. When you return tickets after the ride you'll get 500 WON for each back. "
Metro,Tried using the metro while i was in Seoul. A great way to travel around Seoul beside using the taxi. Train is on time and subway is very clean.
Very easy transport system,Use it when traveling in Seoul. Very Cheap and very simple. Will help you move all along the city at a very reasonable price
"Big , intimidating but efficient ","12 lines , massive infrastructure , stations like mini cities First impression can be intimidating but as a tourist you must download the subway app and then it is ok because the app is in English. After u have app then subway is bliss. T money cards can be bought and changed in convenience stores. "
Fast and Cheap,Sometimes crowded but fast and pretty easy to get used to it even if you do not speak or read Korean. 
Gate way of Seoul ,"Seoul Metro is the best way to travel in Seoul, but sometime will take a long walk to transfer from one line to another. And might require some basic Korean language skill as a lot of the stations' name only have Korean or Korean style English "
Metro ✌,cheapest way to travel with fun... especially the illegal guys who are sailing socks etc. . Be silent at the tube even if the others are being much more loud than you... 
The most convenient way to travel in Seoul,"During my stay I only relied on the metro and it got me everywhere. It's only crowded when people go to work in the morning, when kids get out of school in the afternoon, and again when kids are going home after their private classes at night.The staff is wonderful. If you need help as a tourist, someone will approach you before you would ask for help.If you don't speak Korean, when you check out at the exit gate, the gate will thank you and wish you a nice day, so don't mistake this for an error message, just pass through the gate confidently.Expect to walk a lot, Seoul metro stations cover a big area underground. But both exits and transfer points are very easy to find.You must know through which exit you need to leave! But if you forgot to check that in advance, there are maps and directions that tell you what you find near each exit.Line 1 is the oldest, line 9 is the newest. So trains and their display/announcement systems vary, but you will always know where you are, even if you don't speak Korean or read Hangeul."
Download Seoul metro Map!!!,They have a lot of lines crisscrossing each other hence you will need to download the map to navigate. Buy your Tcard/cashbee card from 7-11 etc and top up at machines located near the entrance of the metro.Please take note that not all entrances/exit have top up facilities. We top up a total of 20kwon for our 7days trip and still have enough balance.Involves a lot of walking and climbing of stairs. Lift is slow and small. Escalators not readily available 
To travel with T-Money Card or Special Tourist Pass,"Seoul has excellent metro system. The issue is more on the mode of payment for tourist. If your stay is just one day in Seoul, just pay cash from the ticket vending machines. If you stay is two days or more and depending on your sightseeing plan, the Special Tourist Pass is a better option than the T-Money Pass. Though the Special Tourist Pass dor two to five dayts has a limit of up to 20 metro rides per day, it is unlikely you will use your metro rides limit."
Great Way to Get Around - CLEAN,Very easy system to navigate with great mobile apps and consistent English station names everywhere.
Great way to get around the city,"The Seoul Metro covers most of the city, is easy to navigate, and reasonably priced. I used it to get to the markets. People are very willing to help answer your questions and guide you to the right station or subway line."
Good Transportation in Seoul,"For beginner we need more time to read seoul metro map, but after that, it's easy to travel around seoul... love it"
"Extensive network, very efficient","Traveling with Seoul the Metro system is probably the most efficient way to do it. Very big reach. Comfortable, clean and very friendly to foreign travelers as well"
Very efficient,"It's a very efficient way to get around Seoul. Download the subway app to know which stations to get on/off and the times that the trains are passing by your stop. Sometimes, taking the bus may be cheaper and more convenient if you have a lot of bags, so double check with Google Maps. :P"
Fast and clear!,"A very effective and comprehensible system, great for getting to different points of the city really fast. "
Lack of escalators in most stations. ,Seoul metro stations are in need of providing more friendly mode for elderly to decend or ascend to the platforms. It's quite a tiring taste to climb 3 flights of steps some 2 or 3 storey high. Elevators are available in some subway station but small acomodating up to 8 persons.It's worst if you have shopping or luggage. Seoul main station n Incheon airport station have sufficient elevators n escalators. Anyway be prepared to climb a lot of stairs. ...Trains are clean n very efficient. So can go practically anyway by subway. It's is the most efficient n cheapest form of travel in Korea. Koreans must be really fit to climb those stairs daily!!!
Nice and cheap way of travel for city like Seoul,Seoul metro provides excellent mode of travel for cheap and affordable rates. Just buy T money and top up regularly. All the major parts of city and suburb are connected by this rail.Must use.
Clean and Efficient,"A cheap, fastest and super efficient network of transportation system. However non-Korean speaking travellers have to be more alert of the station stops as signage are mostly in Korean."
Very Efficient System,Easy to use and figure out as signs are in English as well as Korean. Cheap to use-a great way to get around.
Excellent Service and Well Coverage,"Metro lines services were excellence, we almost got around the city and places of interests by metro at all time. And sometime with the helped of the local. The price was reasonable. And it's not difficult to understood how the metro lines worked. The best part was that after we buying the store valued card, this would save us a lot of trouble to change and buy tickets at all time. This Metro lines were friendly to tourists too."
Superb & Extensive System,Well covered throughout the city. We made full use of the subway during our 9 days trip. Not enough English directional signage. Train direction signage on the platform are not located at strategic points.Not stroller friendly in some stations. Elevator signage not prominent. 
One of the best in the world,"It never ceases to fascinate me, how well planned and established is the system. Its always better to get app for shortest times taken vut i general it just makes life easier and no need for expensive car. Also very efficient airport connection."
staircase not convenient for old folks,"many stations are without or not fully provide escalator or elevator for old folks, or people with large baggage, need plan ahead on which station to transit so old folks won't hassle with staircase problem."
Easy,"Great metro system - easy and fast. Can navigate even as an English speaker, though you do need to be pretty observant. Enjoyed this for transportation from the airport to the city! "
easy access and fastest way to travel inside Seoul,Every station have elevators installed for convenience and best way to get around Seoul. Stations are clean and well maintained.
Main transportation in Seoul,Seoul Metro is the main transportation in the capital and basically covers every corner in the city. 
Easy to get around town..,Friendly staff will guide you. Just find the one that can speak English or understand where you like to go.
Download a map to your mobile phone!,"It's very easy to use it but you need a map. I didn't find any paper version at any station and then realised that I'm in very technological advanced country :) so all people have it in the phone application. Be vigilant during a travel because some trains don't translate in English the name of the station or they display it very fast and then change quickly to Korean language. This is the fastest, cleanest and cheapest metro I ever used in the world. "
Best way to get around Seoul,"Seoul's Metro (subway) is huge. The route map boggles the mind, but you can get close to most major sights in the city. Clean and well marked with English signs as well as Korean. Lots of maps of the station area to see which is best exit to get out at. Buy T-money card to use and then it just deducts the fare as you use it. You can buy at subway station or any convenience store. Just add more money when you get low. Trains are frequent and only crowded right at rush hours. It can be a long walk at some stations to change metro lines or get up to the street. We used metro and airport rail to go to Incheon Airport. It took a bit over an hour from Central |Seoul."
Very useful during my visit in Korea,I travelled from airport to the main cities just using the subways and it was good experinced to see local activities during travel. Very afforable fees but yet to climb stairs.. hehe..
Good for longere trips,"Clean, fast and easy. Crowded at times. Being a family of four We found out, a taxi was cheaper for tours under 3 kilometers. Make sure to buy a card you Can fill with cash. "
"Easy, logical & clean",Easiest way to get around. Quiet (by other capital city standards) even at rush hour. Use a t-money card for quick tagging
One of the most organized metros of the world,"Together with Singapore and Hong Kong, Seoul has one of the best metros of the world. Different lines that go to many places in Seoul and also to both airports (Gimpo and Incheon). Very cheap."
Convenient,"Convenient, visitors friendly to mark station with numbers, easy to recognize and find, what can be improved is the frequency of trains incoming could be more often"
Okay....,The train didnt come very often as in japan.But the station and train are mostly new.Its easy to navigate metro sub in seoul.
Tip top,"Goes everywhere. Complex, and does not provide super detailed info to Google, which makes it trickier than it has to be...but managable. Will get you where you are going, for sure. The busses work well too. In both, the station names only show in Korean in Google maps though, which can be tricky."
The best subway system in the world.,"Clean, quick, very cheap, and announcements and signage in English as well makes it almost a joy to use. But avoid commuter rush hour. Like any underground system at peak times it can be a trifle cosy!"
Fast and Efficient,Cheap way to travel in Seoul. Buy the T money pass and top up money from vending machine at the station. English sign are everywhere. Trains are on time. Be prepared to climb up and down the stairs. The metro can be very crowded during peak hour.
Many lines of many colors,Use T-money for your metro trip but don't buy it at convenience store as it will be more expensive. I was charged 4000won while the actual price is 2500won. 
Convenient and user-friendly,"We were very impressed with the Metro, it's very convenient and user-friendly even for us traveling with young children. We took the Metro for most of the places we visited. Use the preloaded T-Money cards for fast access and convenience. And it's cheaper than paying cash too. The card can be bought and topped-up at most convenience stores and also at every major stations. Children cards are available and at discounted rate too."
Easy and fast,"Metro is clean, comfortable, easy to use and fast. All signs are both Korean and English. When using single trip metro tickets (1300 won) you will get some money back when returning the ticket to another atm just next to the ticket sales machine after your trip. I used single tickets but purchasing a time card is more clever as the same ticket works on all local transport."
more place easy go,"the train clean and easy to have notice which stop. Just winter so hot and don't go when 6:30 - 7:30 when weekday, so many people"
Very impressive,"This type of transportation was pretty impressive for me. very easy to take with cheap fare. I was able to reach most places with the subway. Just one inconvenient thing was, there are not enough English signages for directions.. "
great way to travel to the other side...,"Seoul is huge, and traffic is bad...this is a wonderful way to get to neighborhoods and places a car will not be able to even park..."
Unbelievably vast and complex but relatively easy to navigate,Its a HUGE subway system. But the signs are clear and even a lay foreigner can make his way around. Relatively cheap (as compared to other modes of travel in seoul). Extremely well maintained and clean. 
Le métro de seoul,"The Korean metro is very good to get around Seoul. It is clean and there is air condition in the wagon..It is very safe. If you are a little bit lost, You still can ask staff around the metro. Not much waiting. You don't wait too long for the next subway car.It runs kind of late too.It is better to buy a pass, and or it depends or your stay."
Clean and efficient ,Well laid out. Cheap to use. Easy to navigate. We got a T money card for convenience. Easy to top up at a machine and there's language options. 
Efficient & sufficient signage on road direction,"Not only is the Seoul Metro efficient and convenient, they have plenty of signage and maps within the platform or at the gantry level in English for tourist. *thumbs up*"
Seoul Metro is well-organized and efficient for your daily travel!,"Always use the Metro for my transport. I love the line # 2 and 3 the most :)! LIne number 2 is a circular line, so it hits pretty much all the tourist attraction around the seoul. The monitors for transport update is always nice!"
Really convenient and very extensive,"We travelled extensively on the subway system and found it very convenient, using the diagrammatic subway map, which is part of the readily available Seoul Official Tourist map. The lines are helpful named Line 1, 2, 3 etc. assisting route planning, with recommended interchanges marked on the map. The in-carriage LED displays give the name of the next station in both Korean and English, sometimes supplemented by a verbal announcement. Occasionally, the trains were crowded - on one occasion extremely crowded! - as with all subway systems."
Convenience,"Very convenient mode of transpo, i suggest you purchase t money first to mak your trips less of a hassle. "
a bit complicated to foreigner,"a bit complicated to foreigner, better to download the subway app, it will guide you how to travel / transfer lines. the fare is quite expensive, krw1250 even you only travel 1 stop (yes, it's much cheaper than taxi, i know)"
Convenience and inconvenience of Seoul Metro/Subway ,"We travelled mostly via the subway throughout our stay, even though we had three young kids in tow. Most attractions and places of interest are within reach of their network. Get a T-card (stored value transit card) from any machine in the station (English instructions available) and just tap and go. The card is used on their Airport and public buses as well. Top up and refund the card at the machine too. Refund can also be made at Incheon Airport convenience store but it can be a hassle if you lack time. The best part is that the subway fares are very affordable.There are many lines in the system, so check where to transfer at the stations before boarding. A fair bit of walking may be required between stations, and access are mainly via staircases, so it would be terrible if you have a child stroller or someone in wheelchair. Lifts are also not available for every exit.While it may be cold outside, it can get stuffy and warm in some trains as they don't seem to switch on the aircon at all, maybe just ventilation. Convenience stalls located at trackside also provide snacks and drinks, and people do eat in the trains. However , the train system is generally clean. To get a better idea on the train system, do check their website first to see the various Lines."
Convenient transportation in Seoul,"It is very convenient to use the metro subway to travel most of the tourist attractions. It is fast and the directional signs are clear. If you frequently use the subway, it is advisable to buy a T-money card to save you to purchase the ticket every time. Also the is a discount to use the T-money card."
Efficient and Convenient,"As metro systems go, the Seoul Metro is efficient and ticketing is easy. You just buy an Oyster card like T Money card. You can not only use it on the Metro but also in convenience stores.The trains are clean and there are platform doors. A good way of traveling across this city."
Easy to navigate around ,Easy to get on and navigate around if you have the map (from information booths).There's no train station to seek help from though. But TripAdvisor and Google could be your best friend to find the station to get to. train tickets can be purchased at station for single trips or to get their card (deposit $3000 won) and top up your value required. There is a deposit machine for refund at the train station too. 
very convenient and reasonable transportation,"it is very easy to locate the ticketing counter and they offer group discount of 6000 won per person for group of 3 or above, the cabin is very comfortable and there are racks to put your luggage, it takes only 50 minutes from Incheon airport to Seoul station."
"Easy, Convenience, Clean","This is the best idea to visit Seoul by using Subway. The trains are clean, and all of the stations are numbered, you can easy to find your way by taking subway,"
Seoul Metro,"Easy to use, lots of English signs to help you get around. Clean wait areas and clean trains. You can literally get anywhere in Seoul using this Metro system."
Reachable Metro,"When I first saw the metro map I was so confused, they have many lines and connections. But when you look more detail it is understandable and very convenient (due to the many lines available, you are connected and go everywhere you want) "
Very convenience,"Their metro cover the whole city, the train compartments are clean and tidy, you better buy the T-money card from any convenience stores, it is easy for tourist to use then other mean of transportation."
"Clean, safe and emakes exploring the city easy","First, I would not call this an attraction on its own. It's public transportation- a way to get from one place to another. To use the Metro you'll need a T-money card which can be purchased many places, including the GS25 convenience stores. You swipe the card to get through the turnstiles and each ride currently costs about 1250 won regardless of transfers or how long the ride is. In the underground areas both before and after you swipe you can often find shopping and snacks for purchase. I highly recommend downloading the Seoul Subway app- it makes it very easy to know which direction to go and when to transfer as well as things like when the next train is coming and which side the doors are on.If you are an English speaker like me, you will be glad to know that the station information, both over the speaker and on the signs inside the metro, is repeated in english.As a solo female traveller I have never once felt unsafe on the Seoul Metro, primarily because the city's CCTV system has made it a very safe place to travel.Be sure to watch out for the seats (usually at the front or back of a car) with little icons above them indicating they are for elderly and injured people. Even if the train is full it is customary to leave these seats empty unless you fit one of those categories. Don't be put off if people push and stand very close to you, it's just a cultural difference. People don't tend to part to let you through so if you are riding during a busy time and need to get off don't be afraid to push your way out."
FASTEST & EFFICIENT WAY TO REACH YOUR DESTINATION,"Unlike our MRT, their subway have different lines. Meaning you may transfer to another subway just to reach certain destination.They have a self-service ATM machine where you can urchase the subway ticket. Always ask the assistance of Koreans in buying tickets. They could hardly speak and understand English but I normally write down in a piece paper where I am going and that is how they assisted me. There is also a machine where you can surrender the subway card and will refund you a 500 korean won."
great metro system,"Seoul metro system is efficcient, clean and easy to navigate for English speakers. Signs and announcements are in both Korean and English."
Spotless. Well organized. Safe. Cheap. Easy to use.,"Thought this was such a well run metro system. The T money card system makes it easy to pay for your travels. The whole system is spotlessly clean. The plethora of communication methods (tv screens, announcements in 3 languages, flashing live maps showing where your train is and more) made this a very easy system to learn quickly and not get lost on. The stations are very close to each other, unlike say London where the station distances are much greater. "
Efficient!,"Love the card you can but Tmoney-from all sorts of stores & use on the metro. Great system-colour codes, line numbers, station numbers, direction names-so however your brain works it's manageable!Beware-big walks to trains sometimes-especially between lines"
Excellent metro system!,"Super easy to use, really clean, excellent network. Lines are colour coordinated and numbered, transfers are well signed, English announcements, T money cards easy to use and buy. Sometimes only stairs, no escalators"
Cheap and easy to navigate,"Stations were clean and well marked for English. There was a wide variety of food, drink and shopping choices. "
Always off to review...,"...tube networks as 'Attractions' but seeing as it's classified as such, I may as well. This is one of the cleanest, best-run underground train transport networks in the world. It's easy and cheap to use, even with no knowledge of Korean, and has a simple map that gets you wherever in the city you'd like to go."
Clean and user friendly,"Very clean, smooth ride, easy to navigate. Downside: beware of rush hour. It gets crazy crowded and people push and become rude. Americans may get culture shock if traveling at that time of day. Otherwise, people are generally nice. A patriarchal culture--so don't expect a man to give up his seat for a woman, especially a slightly older man for a younger woman. "
Excellent transportation system,"The system is clean, efficient, and easy to use. Various lines serve Seoul Station, where you can connect with the railroad system. One caution -- the subway does not start running until 5:30am. We could not find out what time the first train would come to the station nearest us. We had to catch an early train so took the taxi to Seoul Station."
Hop on hop off,Easiest way to go around the city. You could get the ticket and T Money card from vending machine in the station. The card deposit costs about 3000won and you have to top up for the balance. The card could also use to pay in other participated stores as well. 
"Efficient, inexpensive and easy to use","Wow, what a transit system! English signs throughout, exits to street all numbered and maps at every station make it easy to navigate for the non-Korean speaker. The only thing I noticed is that headways between trains were not as frequent as they are in other big Asian cities. But the trains are huge so never seem really crowded -- yes, well used and busy, but seldom stuffed. And the T-card made paying easy ... they're readily available at any convenience store."
Lots of climbing up stairs!!!!!,There are many lines but as long as you have some metro apps you should be able to go around anywhere. Do wear comfortable shoes to prepare for climbing up stairs stairs stairs 
Cheap & Efficient,Getting around Seoul couldn't be easier. The 9 different lines can get you to or close to your destination cheaply and efficiently. The trains are clean if not sometimes a bit stuffy. regardless of the time you travel it feels very safe.The signs are all very clear once you follow the logic. Travelling with large suitcases at some turnstile entrances could be a problem. Purchasing a ticket is easy with multiple language options. Just remember to get your deposit back at the end of your journey.
Tube,"Overall this tube is pretty good. One thing I will mention is that it's very big, which means if you get bored easily I would recommend bringing a book/GameBoy. You can use your pop/T money card here which is very handy also. Average experience all round. "
A well-connected and efficient network,The Seoul Metro network is well-connected and efficient. The stations and trains are clean. Information is also available in English making it easy for tourists.
Best choice to move around Seoul,"The subways is easy, clean, cheap and beats the crazy traffic in Seoul. Don't even doubt if you should try it, there is no better way to move around the city."
Efficient and Accessible,We are amazed at the frequency & comprehensiveness of the underground services. It is comfortable & very clean. 
If you don't mind a few stars.....,"Cheap, easy, timely and stress-free way to see Seoul but there are stairs and some walking involved. So, as long as you are okay with that, it is the best way to travel quickly from spot to spot."
quick quick,"convenient..easy, chip, fast.. the best way to get everywhere in seoul. wide-spreaded to each area.. you can basically reach everywhere with this amazing subway."
"very good and clean, easy to get around, quite cheap","The metro is a great way to get around in Seoul, and connects even neighboring cities like Sewon or Incheon. In most of the metro stations, you can find CLEAN bathrooms as well as ATMs. Metro stations can be quite large, so be sure to check where you want to go to. I highly recommend to take a picture of the metro map on your cell phone, so you have an easy reference to look up lines and connections."
"Must be able to walk, travel light. Many stairs long walk","It is the cheapest transport to move about in Korea but you must be able to walk, walk and walk far. Very complicated to transfer to the next subway.If you missed an exit, you will lose your way to hotel and finding your exit is not easy. The outside street and buildings are in Korean must get Seoul Apps for direction like GPS for car.From Incheon Airport to get to the all-stops Airex Train was easy. Buy the T-card at the store cost kw4000. That's a charges. You top up kw5000 you get only 5000 credit!!!!I think pay by cash is cheaper (Would someone let me know) ..Especially for me, I used the T card to go to/fro Seoul city hall and that cost me kw12,800 in total (both ways). However, this is cheaper than limousine bus to hotel about kw32000 both ways. If we have parents who can't walk better use the limousine buses.It is a long ride from Incheon Airport to Seoul station mostly underground. When we get out from the all stops train to transfer to subway Line 1 to city hall, it gets complicated and a very long walk with your luggages, flights of stairs without electric elevator. After getting out of the line one subway, it is another long walk to city hall exit, the furthest most exit 6. After experiencing it, we felt the direction in English is clear but such long walk worried us. As I prepared for my trip, I read that using Tcard earn a kw100 discount right after you use your Tcard, but there was never a machine I sighted, only buying subway tickets machines. For young tourists, it is a very good experience and I help some tourists as I walked towards the Airex."
Impressed,"Great transportation, first world, is fully satisfied with the service provided. A very useful way to transport you throughout Korea."
"Easy to use subway system, very convenient and comparable cheap",A good way to move around in Seoul and avoid traffic jams in taxis. Trains and subway stations are clean.
Huge metro ,"This is a huge metro system, machines have English and it is easy to purchase tickets. We were with our elderly father however and the subway system involves tons of stairs and very long underground passages which were tough. It is not often possible to find escalators or an elevator."
One of a kind experience! Must do!,The Seoul metro is a one of a kind experience and a must do when you're visiting Seoul! It is unique with the funny sounds when the metro is arriving and also a very convenient and fast way to transport yourself through Seoul! 
Excellent Metro service,This is one of the finest Metro service as compared to any other country. Metro stations are modern with huge shopping malls either attached to it or situated at Metro station itself.
These things go almost everywhere,"Having arrived at the Seoul (train) station, I was glad to see that at least one subway line was near the station. There are over a dozen lines and I think I would have been totally confused about how to get anywhere if I hadn't used the Kakao Maps app on my phone. It's in Korean but fairly straightforward.The Seoul subways are a bit wider than the ones in Busan. They can also be crowded at various times and places. I use the T-money or Bee card to scan in and out and I highly recommend it. You can purchase one at any convenience store."
Love this subway.,"The Seoul subway system is easy to use, clean, cheap and convenient. With the T Money card you are set. The only downside is that it does not run 24/7. "
Travel with great ease when visiting Seoul,"We always find metro travel much easier to get around a city which we do not know much about. Seoul Metro is excellent. All very clean, spacious and efficient and on par with many of the excellent metros in south east asian cities like Tokyo, Hong Kong, Taipei, Shanghai and Beijing. Travellers are very orderly. Ticket prices are very reasonable compared to Europe."
Very Good and Efficient,"Beats American subways big time! So clean, always on time, cheap, and very fast. Buy the metro card and return is after for small deposit return"
Efficient and Clean,"Efficient and convenient for getting around Seoul. However, the downside is lack of escalators/elevators in some stations."
Tips for Seoul etro,"The Metro can be crowded, so be ready for it. There is no free wifi available. There is an excellent free guide app (Subway Korea) which you should download onto your phone before starting to use the metro, and it covers all the major cities. Most of the station names on maps and signposts are shown in both Korean and English, but it is well worthwhile checking the main stations on the line in the direction you want to go so as to be able to get on the train heading the right way. Buy a metro card at the start of your visit (also good on buses and in other cities) and keep it topped up. There are easy to use machines for this in every station, with the option of instructions in English."
Best in the world ,"Best city metro of any city we have visited. So efficient, clean and convenient. Also relatively cheap way of getting around."
"Easy to use, well-connected","Despite 9 lines it's still easy to use. Mobile apps are available but I prefer to use the printed map guide, especially the Seoul Concierge, where interchanges are clearly marked. It is also a good walking guide with all the attractions and directions listed. Get a T-money card, which can also be used in Busan metro and buses. Although you can't top up in Busan stations you can easily top up in convenience stores "
 Visiting our son ,Terrific public transportation! There are several areas to get on and off. Well lit and comfortable.
Easy way of getting around Seoul - consider using M-Pass,"This trip I used M-Pass 5 day for 45,000 won. This allows you to take up to 20 trips a day so it's excellent value if you want to use the system extensively. The SMRT system is easy to use with signage in both Korean and English. "
User Friendly,"I love taking transit in new places and the Seoul Metro was very easy. You just go to a card machine, create a new card, add value and voila! Me mindful that you cannot use Google Maps for walking/driving directions in Korea. You can, however, map transit. Although it's in Korean, NaverMap will help with walking directions. You might just need to look up a few English walkthroughs on which buttons to press!"
The best they could offer,"Words like amazing, excellent, best are some of the phrases you could apply to their transit system. Basically most of the places of interested are within short walking distance if they are not very short. They are on time, and provide English in-train announcement in tourist focused spots. However, first timer might want to do some study first hand about the network system and transiting methods between different lines. Do take note about the exits as well as they might land you further away from your destination if you took the wrong one.Other option for getting around would be using taxi. As it would cost a minimum rate of 1250KRW each time, even you are just one station away."
Best way to get around Seoul,Easy and convenient. All signs and announcements are also in English so it's no trouble to find your way. If you buy a T-money pass it's also incredibly good value to get around.
"Many Metro Lines, But was not complicated to get on a train .","You need to buy a metro card , then put money into the card then you ready to go . you can used Google Maps or just look and find out which lines to get on with different colors , or just asked , like we did lol , ppl usually are friendly and will tell you . Oh and it cheap to take Metro !!"
amazing transit system.,"Coming from the western world we like to think that most of our systems are far superior to those of the eastern side, but that simply is not true at all. As a first time traveller to Korea, i found it the transit, more specifically their subway systems, to be incredibly efficient and user friendly, most places that you could possibly want to visit or see are just a quick ride and/or transfer away. We opted to buy the actual transit card and load up our cards with about 10,000 krw and this lasted us most of our 4 days we stayed in Seoul. Im unsure if the locations of the stations were strategically placed or if the places and locations were built around them later, but most of the places we travelled to and visited was never more than a 5 min walk from any station."
one of faverite transportation method in Seoul,There are over 10 lines to take. Their coverage is almost 80% in Seoul. you can go anywhere in seoul using the metro. 
Super Easy,"Lived in Seoul for a year, and this is hands-down the best way to travel. If you're staying a while, invest in a t-money card that you can use in taxis and buses as well."
Extremely Tourist-friendly and Efficient,"I'm really impressed by Seoul's metro system, because 1) there are many stations where you can transfer to many other places of attractions, 2) most of the attractions in Seoul are accessible via metro, 3) They have English/Mandarin/Japanese words/speaking the names of the stations so it's almost impossible to be lost! 4) It also shows the train moving towards the next station, so that you would not board on the wrong stop, 5) The trains come in fixed timings and there was hardly any delay the 6 days I was there!"
Confusing if you dont speak the language and it's your first time,"I was able to kind of understand how the train system works but it can be very overwhelming for a first timer and someone who cannot speak the language. I found that there was lack of informaition booths. I relied on the subway map and google maps. note that at times, google maps is not able to translate which can be very frustrating! I got lost a couple of times trying to find the other side of the station! Piece of advice: before you travel, study your routes first. If you get lost, take a taxi instead."
Seoul Metro is one of the best in the world,"Very convenient, clean, spacious. You can find Seoul Metro map in nearly every document for tourists."
Seoul-id Ride!!!,It was fast and efficient! I thought I will not be able to use the metro but ended up abusing it! Mostly what I used to get around Seoul and to other parts of SK. Very accessible and cheap! Used the T-Money.
Efficient and clean,"If you're staying in Seoul, definitely take advantage of the subway system. You can get pretty much anywhere you need to and it's relatively cheap and easy to use. That said, you will have to figure out how things work at first, but that is not a big deal honestly. Take the time, you'll thank yourself."
metro,We did not use the metro very often. We were a little intimidated. The were not many signs in English and we did not know are way around well enough. We took taxis most of the time and they were quite reasonable.
This system gets you EVERYWHERE!,"While visiting my son (who lives here) I can get ANYWHERE by myself! They've got a cool app you can download to your phone that will help you map your routes around South Korea! It's beyond CLEAN! They've got seats reserved for the elderly, always. The stops and the announcements are said in Korean first, then English.At some of the major stops where trains intersect or are in the heart of highly visited locations, they have massive underground shopping centers filled with microbusinesses. So much eye candy! I was honestly over-stimulated.They've done a MASTERFUL job creating this beautiful and effective transportation system."
Fast and Efficient,"I've had fairly pleasant experiences using the Seoul subway system. The trains are typically on time but run frequently enough that a delay here or there doesn't mean too much. Clean, fast, and an inexpensive way to travel throughout Seoul."
It's a metro,"It's a great way to get around Seoul and the surrounding area. If it operated earlier in the morning that would be great, but as it stands, it's great value for money. Almost everything in English, Japanese and Chinese too, so good for tourists. "
Fast and efficient,"Like most major cities in Asia, Seoul has the metro figured out. Clean, safe, easy to understand. It's really the best way to get around Seoul."
One of the best subway system in the world,"Seoul Metro is very nice. All of the trains are equipped with very pleasant HVAC system, relatively quiet, newer trains with wide and long cabins. Seoul Metro has about 20 different lines. Looking at the map of the metro lines, I thought I was watching a spider web and more lines are under construction. It feels go good to ride in a new trains that serves in a newly opened lines and the very clean station buildings with escalators, elevators and very friendly design for the handicapped. The basic fare is 1,350 won which is around 1.25 US dollars. "
Easy to access the locations for travellers,Easy to access most of the sightseeing areas and the most convenience way for travelers to understand to take which line and interchange station to the destination.
A very good transportation,"Always on time and the best tool to get around Seoul and nearby areas. Line 1, blue line takes you all the way to Sunwon where you can visit Suwon Hwaseong Haenggung .The only thing we complain that there are too many steps to climb and escalator and elevator are not widely available. If you stay in Seoul more than 2 days, I recommend you to purchase a T-money card. I found out that I had to buy the T-money card from a convenient store not from a vending machine (there is one just next to vending machine, called CU). After you purchased the card,that cost 4,000 won. You have to top up the card before you can use it. I top up the 10,000 won initially. Before you leave Korea, get your refund from the convenient store if it is over 500 won. You have to pay 500 won for handling fee. If 500 won or less, you can get it from the vending machine. I tried to get my 4,000 won which originally pay for the card was in vain. Apparently, the face value of the card (4,000 won) is not refundable but it does not expire.A word of advise, each station has many exits. Some station may have 15 exits. Before you head out to your destination, study your map and find out the surrounding street names, buildings and/or landmarks of your destination. Before you exit study the station layout, posted on the wall, to find out the exit number which will be close to the main street, buildings and/or landmarks of your destination. Otherwise, once you exit out, you may get lost."
Efficient transit services,Moving around Seoul using the underground train services are very convenient. The multi train lines don't look complicated. It provides easy transfer within most major stations. Though taking taxi around the city is cheap but it can't beat the unobstructed train lines that convey riders to their destination in quick time.
clean metro & clear English directions,"Seoul metro has English signage on stops, ticket machine instruction was clear too. There is a Help button at the entrance/exit gates which I found very useful. When I had trouble exiting with my kid on the stroller, I pushed this button and a staff came out to help. "
Good for going around in Seoul,"Seoul Metro is probably the most reliable form of transport for tourists. One could get caught in heavy traffic jams in taxis. Most popular tourist spots are readily accessible via the Metro. However one has to do some research beforehand ie to get familiar with the main lines (Lines 1-4), the main stations and their various exits. Fortunately one could get all such information on the internet, eg download from the official website of Seoul Metro ie smrt.co.kr. Changing lines on the metro could be taxing, it could be a long walk within the station eg in City Hall or in Seoul Station. Another thing to watch out for is that you need to know which direction you are going, in selecting the right subway entry-gate at the station. Quite often one goes into the wrong one (if not careful). Some trains have good LCD displays showing the next stop but unfortunately some don't hence is necessary to keep an eye on where you are. The first-time visitors may find the signs (arrows) confusing but actually sign-posting in the stations are quite good. The people in the subways are generally well-behaved and polite to tourists eg quite prepared to help eg if you do not know how to change subway lines. Language is quite a problem as they do not seem to understand English at all, so carry with you some handy notes or have a translation app installed on your mobile phone."
Most efficient transportation in Seoul!,We visited Seoul last month and one of the things that made our journey easier and faster was the metro.Plus factor was the free wifi in the stations!
Efficient system,It may seem complicated but it was easy to navigate around as bilingual signs were provided. The stations and trains were super clean. Staff were helpful if you are lost. Purchase a T-money card as it was cheaper to travel with it instead of buying single fares. The only downside was you have to walk quite a distance if you wanted to transfer from one line to the other. Be prepared to climb stairs!
Confortable and on time.,"Punctual, comfortable, and always 'on-the-go'. Not to hard to understand map, just have to pay attention when taking the train."
Best Metro in Asia,"How funny that you can rate the metro system. We used this as our primary mode of transportation in Seoul. We were staying out near Sinseldong station which was equidistant to all locations (15-30m) to Hongdae, Itaewon, Myeondong, Dongdaemun etc. Since we were far away we relied on the subway, taxi would be inconvenient to get so far.pro's: the subway jingles for arrival, departure and end of line are fun!super clean, crowded but never too crowdedcon's: subway stops running at midnight, rely on bus and taxi thereafter."
efficient,"Seoul Metro is a very efficient system. It covers majority of the locations (should be enough for tourists). Also, there're toilets, seats and lockers in nearly every stop."
Easy access,Traveling via the subway was a breeze. It was well connected and very easy to move around. The staff are friendly and will provide assistance when approach
Yet another subway,"What can one say about subway? Convenient way to get from point A to point B, that's it. The stations are utilitary, no great views as in Moscow, for example. There is rechargeable card system, that's convenient also, but not unique (the same I saw in Barcelona and Moscow). Subway is not only in Seoul, but also connect nearest cities (1-2 hours far away from Seoul) - again, the same as in Barcelona. There is usually free WiFi on the stations, but no free internet in the trains (only the payed one).Looks much more clean than European subways, no graffity and garbage."
Almost easy enough for this tourist,"Incredibly inexpensive, clean, prompt, and easy to ride. The English names are there, you just have to look hard to find them. I always felt safe, and only got lost once in 10 days. Easy and cheap way to get around the city. We bought the KoreaPass card, and refilled it as needed. Super easy."
Seoul Metro ~ User Friendly!,"The Seoul Metro system is user friendly (signage in English), inexpensive and reliable. Only downsides are how limited the night time operating hours are with last trains ending between 11 pm and 12 am, over crowding on the main lines, the conditions in the stations during the summer months (unbearable humidity) and winter months (freezing cold temps), and the disgusting public washrooms. Download the English-language App ""Subway Korea"" to help you easily navigate the system."
subway,- cheap and confortable- transfers are sometimes very long. Plse ask around to the best ttansit station;- most towns are reachable with subway system although it takes time....
Best system I've tried,"English directions are not too hard to figure out. Most machines in the subway stations will sell T-Money cards and have an English option. Be courteous and know that at busy times people will line up in order to get on the trains. Download the free app called ""Subway"" if you look for Seoul Subway to map out where you want to go in English.Very clean and safe."
seoul transportation is great,whatever you need to discover seoul is google map and seoul public transportation ticket. you can easily access every point in the city. metro is amazingly developed and i suggest everyone to try public transportation in seoul as a must.
Seoul Metro,"Outstanding mode of public transportation! Easy to use, clean and safe. Was able to figure out the system in a matter of a couple days. No better way to get around town."
Don't be intimidated,"For the first time visitor, Seoul can be intimidating, but if you need to travel around the city then the subway is the perfect solution, and it is EASY to use even if you don't speak a word of Korean. All you need to do is enter a station, and buy a ticket from a vending machine, all of which have an English language option. You can then just tap on and off as you start or end your journey, and I am sure that you will find the trains quick, clean and efficient. It should be noted that Seoul Metro is just one of the rail operators in the city, but as in cities like Tokyo, the different operators seem to have integrated their systems, making it easy to get around. In other words, although taxi's are tempting, give the subway a try. "
Very safe trip,This was my first train out of our country. I can say that it was a safe trip because of the safe state of the train. The staffs are nice and they assist the passengers very well.
Just like any other subway,Be prepared by researching your gate number when you enter and exit the subway to ensure optimal travel routes. Major stations can have up to 7-8 gates.
Best commute in Seoul ,It's my first time taking the subway really so I can't make a comparison with other subways but for the 9 days that we stayed in Seoul this was mainly our means of transportation. I find it faster than the bus and cheaper than taxi. Although its a bit complicated cause there are a lot of lines and we missed our stops and got on the wrong train a couple of times but I think seoul metro is a really good way of going around seoul. 
it's not difficult,We stayed at Dragon Hill and took a taxi to the closest metro $6 taxi fare.We bought a fare card $3 and went Boughon Hanok village. The metro was fast and extremely clean and everyone was willing to help to be sure we got of at the right stop. It was fine we're old and we didn't have problems
Not like Hong Kong or Singapore,"It's very modern and clean, like Hong Kong and Singapore subways but it doesn't have as many walk ways underground to keep you cool on a hot summer day."
Easy to Get by,The trains are pretty good and the station names are in English. Only problem is getting to know which station to get off and transfer. Get the App for the route planner and that should be easy.
The best,"Very easy to use.. For someone who is not good with directions and feels lost all the time, I sure enjoyed the Seoul Metro. I suggest you download the KakaoMetro app or the Subway Korea app. It helped me a lot, especially when changing stations."
Great way to discover Seoul,"We took our trip around Seoul by Metro. Although it takes more time to travel than bus or taxi but it's really convenient and saves us a lot of cost. With only T-money card, we can travel without any hesitation."
Best subway to date...,The best transportation system I have ever used and very inexpensive. Clean and very organized. You can go to any part of the city.
Easy and reliable,"The Seoul Metro is clean, easy to navigate (with the aid of an app) and reliable. Signage is great and information is posted in both Korean and English. I have had several people approach in the metro to ask if I needed assistance! "
Cheap. Easy. Clean. Very friendly and helpful people. ,The Korean people was so polite with us. They were just keep helping us without asking. They are so generate and they didn't try at all use us when we didn't know the currency. Thank you Korean people. And the metro was cheap. Easy to use. I had a map used to move along the city it was so easy. And I got help from people. The metro also was clean. 
Shopping ,Good very. Close to subway station. Stayed for 6 nts. Over 4 reception ladies. Only one of them has been helpful. The rest are cool.
Not at all difficult to understand,"First visit to Seoul and the metro was convenient and easy to access. Ticket machine has English instructions and if you have a map or the Seoul app on a smartphone it is not difficult at all. Don't forget to use the ""refund"" deposit machine to get refund at the end of the journey. "
Metro,I liked to use the metro but you need to know the direction. I advice you to install Seoul metro application. The metro clean and organized.
Easy to use and very accessible,"The Seoul Metropolitan Subway is a modern, clean, and easy to use metro that can be used to get to most places in Seoul and even the suburbs further away easily. If you come from countries with similar metro systems, such as Singapore's MRT or Hong Kong's MTR, then it will all be largely similar and familiar to you.Being a railfan myself, we used the Seoul Metro as much as possible during our time in South Korea. Although there is a bus from Gangnam that goes to Everland directly, we decided to take the metro way instead, just to see how easy and accessible it is. This is a much longer route of course compared to the bus.Signs are in both Korean and English at all stations, with Chinese and Japanese at some major stations as well. You can use a single trip ticket for the subway, but it is always a much better idea to get the T-Money card, which is similar to Singapore's EZ-Link card or Hong Kong's Octopus card, for multiple trips instead. It can be a little difficult to get help sometimes should you get stuck in the turnstiles or gantries though, because often it can be hard to find a station staff to assist unless you press the help button on a separate gantry.One thing that we noticed about the metro is that there are a lot of stairs to climb when in the metro and escalators are somewhat lacking. This is especially more noticeable at older subway lines, such as Line 1 or 2. Furthermore, transferring to another line within the same station can sometimes involve quite a fair bit of a distance. Hence you should be mentally prepared to do A LOT of walking. Luckily, there are lifts for the elderly and disabled at most stations.Another thing to take note is that many of the stations, especially on older lines, operate on a side platform layout and not on an island platform layout. What this means is that if you walked to the wrong side of the platform when transferring lines, that is going to mean walking back one big round of typically 70m to 100m to the other platform. We experienced that first hand when we accidentally went to the wrong platform. Luckily, the next station was an island platform layout so we were able to reverse direction easily. So do make sure to read the signs very carefully before walking down to the platform.Another unusual thing that we noticed is that there are newspaper vendors selling drinks and food and sometimes even shops within the station or the platform itself! So you can still get some food if you are in a rush.Even with all these observations, I would still say the subway is easier and faster to use compared to the bus or taxi, as both of the alternatives require some knowledge of Korean to be able to use them effectively."
Best subway system!,You can conveniently go anywhere in Seoul! It'll take a while to get used to it but it's definitely one of the best train system in the world.
Awesome subway,"Maybe the best subway in the world. Clean, safe, efficient. It's also easy to navigate as a foreigner be user everything is color coded and numbered ... And in English."
"Large, Clean, and Modern ","Most of the foreign subway and train systems I've ridden on are this way and Seoul is no exception. With dual Korean and English just about everywhere it is easy to find your way around. Also, many of the stops are small shopping areas just below street level so you could even pick up something enroute to your destinations. "
"Extensive, clean, reliable and affordable","Fares are at a reasonable price and the simple layout make it easy to get around the city. It's very extensive, among the largest in the world, and will take you to most corners of Seoul. And it goes well beyond Seoul, serving much of Gyeonggi-do, connecting to Incheon, and touching the farther provinces of Chungcheongnam-do and Gangwon-do. Trains run regularly and without many delays. It is kept extremely clean."
Metro is easy to use,Super Easy to use. Make sure to download Transit KR app and make sure to have something like a Tmoney card to make it easier to travel around.
Signs can be really confuse....,"I reckon Seoul needs to do more on the signs, it can be really confuse most of the time. But the cost very very low which is good."
Very efficient ,"It has a lot of lines and also a good frequency, you can visit the hole city by metro. Also you can combine your ticker with buses for free"
Ummm... The Number 1 T.A. Thing to Do? Really??,"Lol. Yes, the subway in Seoul is absolutely fantastic. Excellent connectivity, fast and efficient service, super clean, and quiet as church while traveling ( both the cars and the people inside the cars, haha ). Airport connectivity, hooray! One thing to note, most if not all trains stop running at midnight, so if you are going out shopping late, plan accordingly.How this gets to be the Number 1 Thing to Do, though, is beyond me. It certainly isn't. But it does all but eliminate the need to take a more expensive taxi, esp when used in conjunction with the stellar bus service Seoul offers!"
What a ride,Seoul Metro was a easy way to get around Seoul. Get a taste money card at the vending machines readily available. Top up the card after purchase of at least 3000won or else you will not be able to get thru turnstiles. Did not use the bases but you can use card on them as well. 
Get to know the system and you are fine!,"Spent couple of days traveling with Seoul metro and have to say the system is is clear and orientation simple once you get used to it. The first day we were surprised by the amount of torches, gas masks and fire extinguishers placed all over the metro stations... The metro runs on time and is clean."
"Fast, Efficient and Inexpensive.","The Seoul subway system is modern, clean, and comfortable. It's easy to get all over Seoul by subway and it's fast and inexpensive too. Buy a city pass or t money card and fill it up with a few dollars so you can travel the subways without having to buy a ticket for each leg. With the card, you can get thru the turnstiles and track how much you have left available. If you still have a balance at the end of your trip, you can use it to purchase items at convenience stores or get your money back less the 500 won processing fee (50 cents). It's just like Japan's excellent subway system. Only thing is that Koreans don't build a lot of escalators. You need to be prepared to go up and down staircases a lot. For old guys with a bad hip like me, it can be a challenge. But that's why you have shochu or vodka to help ease the pain after a day on the rails."
Great transportation.,"Easy, very affordable, and clean. One of the best way to get around. You cannot get lost. Waiting time if any at the most 5 minutes."
Seoul Metro,"It is high recommended to visit Seoul Metro for many reasons. First, it is very well designed, clean and organised. Second, you are going to see the outlet where are world brands. Third, Lotte mart is close to the Seoul Metro."
Excellent Metro System...,Very good system of metro with good connectivity. Only drawback is...STAIRS. You need to climb lot of stairs to get into and out of the metro station.
the best public transport over the world,"If you have a plan to visit Seoul, it is recommended making subway stations center of your trip plan. Almost all famous attractions or restaurants are located nearby subway stations. Cheap price , clean and convenient for foreign people and very punctual."
easy transportation,"its very easy to use the subway, you can purchase a ""TMoney"" card from any 7-11 store, and use it for subway or purchases at convenient stores. you don't need to buy individual tickets if you have the handy T-Money card, refill when necessary... Subway is very convenient, however, there are lots of walking up & down stairs, not too many esculators! but overall good experience using subway as way of going places..."
EASY AND CHEAP WAY TO TRAVEL WHEN IN SOUTH KOREA,The Seoul Metro is a very inexpensive way to travel when in South Korea. Links and maps in English can be obtained online and you will find it very easy to navigate throughout the Seoul area.
Using the Seoul metro,"I paid KRW 4,000 for the T-money card.On second thought, I might have been better off buying the single fare ticket.The metro stations are also air raid shelter, so they are way below the surface level.In most cases the stations are pretty large but easy to navigate if you know where you are going.Following are some helpful tips.Always carry the metro map with you.Always make sure that you tap your card(if you are using t-money card) when you are entering or exiting the station.If the card doesn't read when you are exiting the station do not walk away try to contact the station office or use the help button near or next to where you tap your card(look around in that area). The reason is, if you did not tap you card and the machine did not read it, then you will not be able to use the card again.You will get an error message when you try to use the card. If this happens, go to the ticket office and tell them what happened. Tell them the station you boarded and exited on your last trip. They might be able to reset your card.Make sure you are the taking the right exit( the closes exit to the place you are going to), otherwise you will end walking across the station,climbing many set of steps.As soon as you exit the train, while you are still on the platform, check the station and vicinity maps posted on the platform to decide which exit to take. You may also see another map next to it which shows the location of elevators and escalators in the station.The rout maps are posted on the pillars and the glass doors of the platform,make sure you are traveling in the right direction, check the next station on your route and see if the arrow is pointing in that direction.There are announcements in English on the trains, also watch the small tv screen either in the middle of the train or above the exit/entrance door.Once of things you will get used to, when you are traveling in most Asian countries, is that people do not wait for passengers to get off the train before they get in.So, try to go with the flow. Most travel to the various tourist locations with in the city is about KRW 1,250.A trip from the city to COEX Mall(Gangnam) will be an additional KRW100.Hope this helps."
clean and always on time,"It is the easiest way to get around Seoul. There is an online journey planner which is very useful since the fare and number of stations are clearly stated. There are also a few offline apps which you can use. What surprised me was that even though food and drinks are allowed to be taken into the trains, they are all very clean with no litter around anywhere. Thumbs up."
Best metro system in the world,Seoul metro system is by far the best in the world. It is safe and clean and fast and punctual. The number of lines is more than ten and covers every bit of Seoul as well as nearby cities including Incheon and Suwon. The price is also extremely cheap. The running hours are also until midnight for weekends and 1 am for weekdays. For tourists the metro is the best way to get around. Gets pretty crowded during rush hours.
Very convenient,"The metro is very use to use. All along the way you get video and audio announcements about stations, connections etc.. in Korean an in excellent, clear English. Prices are very reasonable"
Clean and comfy,"The platforms are the longest I've ever seen which is great as during rush hour crowds of people are distributed evenly and not all squashed into few carriages.The tunes playing when the train is approaching are so funny!Metro was quick, efficient, on time, clean, very quiet and not very crowded at all."
Nice & clean city,I was really surprised at how nice and clean the city is. People are very nice and very courteous. I love the family owned shops & restaurant as you feel more the warmness as well as the hospitality of the people.
We love the Seoul Metro System!,This is one of the easiest metro systems to use considering that Seoul has over 20 million inhabitants! The signs are in English and Korean (also Japanese as well as Chinese). **Get the T-Money Card to make travel via metro or taxi easier**
spiderweb network,"its quite confusing and not easy to understand but once you understand the logic, its a cheap way to travel between suburbs"
Huge and well orginized,"Long trains, big stations, lots of people. Despite this its clean and well organized. We used T-Money prepaid cards and was very easy and comfortable. "
LOVE the metro!!!,The Seoul metro is one of the easiest to navigate in the world! There's a phone app that is interactive and really useful. I can't remember the app name. There are transfer maps that will tell you at which door to stand/enter to make the transfer the shortest for walking between trains. It's also one of the cleanest subways I've ever been too. And lots of bathrooms (you don't have to pay to use like in Europe). Lockers can be found in the stations at popular stations for a few dollars a day. One thing that is missing from the subway system is... garbage cans. So make sure you throw everything you need to throw away when you do find one.
Easy ride with Seoul Metro,Taking a metro is not a problem when you visit Seoul. Buying a ticket is very easy and the route is easy to explore. The train is clean n comfortable
User friendly,User friendly. Easy to go around with downloaded apps.Trains and stations are clean. Most stations with elevator and wheelchair accessible.
You won't get lost,"Seoul metro map is very clear and easy to understand for those who use it for the first time in Seoul. Each lines have colors and you can find your direction without any body's help. There are ticket vending machines in each station and you can find menu in English, Chinese, Japanese and Korean languages. Stations announced by Korean and English. Do not forget to refund deposit upon completion of your journey in the refund machine installed in each metro stations."
Excellent transportation ,"One of the best, and cleanest subway systems I have been on. It takes a bit of time to familiarise yourself, but very easy to use. Extremely affordable and will get you to any destination in Seoul. "
Great Metro,"Very easy to use, clean and safe. Most directions in both English and Korean on the trains and in the stations."
Gigantic tunnel map,"When you first take a look at the subway map, it's a bit overwhelming. You can get almost anywhere with this very efficient system. At times, it took me up to 3 connections. Each line has a number/color and all signs are in Korean and English.As you may have already read, you need to purchase a T-Money card where your balance will be deducted after you complete a journey. These can be bought at most convenient stores. If you're traveling with luggage, escalators are in each station or at least the stations I went through. If you're going to a particular destination, find the closest exit number as this will save you time. The trains are clean and safety doors/glass separate the platform and the tracks. People who are waiting for an approaching train stand in two lines for each door of the train. People exit the train between the two lines.I highly recommend this system. Use it as much as possible because traffic can be awful!"
Expansive and easy to figure out,The Korean subway is awesome! It's fairly cheap and is made easy for us foreigners. Pretty much everything is translated to English. There's a little song that plays when you arrive at a station that you can transfer at. Then the underground shopping areas are super cute. There's maps all over to ensure you're going the right way. I wish every country had a metro like this. 
Have yet to find a seat,The trains always seem to be standing room only. One ride on the Seoul station blue line did not have A/C. The rest of the metros have been ok. People are usually polite to let those getting off get off before entering. You can easily navigate them without knowing Korean. 
easy to get around,"it is a really cheap and easy way to get around. Just be aware that there aren't as many escalators in the subway, so there is quite a bit of walking up and down stairs. the ticket machine have english translation and is easy to use. we just got one of those single use train tickets which you can get a refund on the card after your travel is completed. That's from another machine. its all very simple and self explanatory. its really pointless being stuck in a taxi as they traffic can be quite bad, try using the train system, it's a great way to travel around!"
Best,"Clean, quick, on time, easy to understand, locals helpful. Maps everywhere. Just fantastic and the only way to get around Seoul."
The Way to Go,"This is such an easy way to get around Seoul. It is fast, efficient, clean and economical. We downloaded the map.on our phone, and it was easy to navigate. It went everywhere we wanted to go. "
Seoul Subway,Brilliant subway system that is very easy and user friendly and is also reasonably priced. The best way to travel around Seoul.
so convenient,"Get a free guidebook from one of the stations- mine was free and was broken down into tourist areas by stations- so if you wanted to go to say Insadong for shopping it would tell you what else was n the area and which station to get off- Users are very polite, I was delighted to see that certain seats are designated for the elderly/ handicapped and even though trains can be very busy these are often empty waiting for the requisite traveler."
Great Subway System,Easy to use and dirt cheap! Getting around Seoul via teh subway sytemt is really easy and starightforward. You purchase a T money card and you can add to it as required. Using the system is made easier by great signage and easy to understand transfer stations.
Not too confusing!!,"I found Seoul metro easy to navigate, clean and reliable. and there are lots of English signs on stations etc. Although the on board displays sometimes did not work. The pre paid T card saves the problem of buying tickets and works out cheaper. Unfortunately card dispensing machines are not available at all stations. Working out journeys is easy using the many apps that are available"
"Fast, clean and efficient",The metro is a great way to get around Seoul. It's an inexpensive and quick way to get almost anywhere in the city.
Cleanest in the world?,"I was first struck by the cleanliness of the subway cars and general access areas. Especially compared to other major cities such as London, Paris, New York (not sure about Tokyo). Feel safe, announcements always include english (in an easily understood accent) and always worked. Cheapest way to get around Seoul."
"pretty good to go around, a little confusing at first","nice and clean subway system, highly recommended if you go from places to places near subway stop. The subway coverage of the entire city was a little spotty, some places are well covered by the subway systems but there are quite number of places that weren't covered by the subway.We were a little confused at first because it is quite a large subway system compared to what we were used to in Hongkong. Map of inside the subway was quite small containing a large amount of information, and the english text was very small, but once you figured it out, it was no longer intimidating."
Best ,"Best services ,clean , cheap and quick . Suggest to try for everyone . You will enjoy for sure . Thank you Seoul metro"
Great way to get about the city,"This is a good choice to get to see the city. Be aware though that unlike a lot of cities, the Seoul Metro does not accept credit cards so you need to have cash to get a ticket."
Clean and simple,"The Metro is very user friendly if you have a basic concept of the city layout. If you can travel in any major city, you can use this system. Warning, the entrances to a lot of stations are not handicap friendly with tons of stairs.We brought a stroller with us, and it requires some negotiations with the stairs and non standardized escalators widths not always allowing the smallest of strollers on some of the escalators. Elevator access was limited and not available at all stations. However, the system was cheap and clean.For foreign tourists, the ticket machines do give change. If using one time only passes, save them after you exit. They can be turned in for a 500W coin when you find the refund machines for those one time use only tickets."
excellent as expected by an asian metropolis,"The metro system in Seoul is jsut like the ones you find in most asian metropolis.Its clean, its always on time and you will never wait more than 5 minutes.Each line is assigned a color and a number to make it easy to navigate. If you have been to places like Tokyo or singapore, you will have no problems adapting to the korean metro. Just remember to get a t-money card. All stations are named in both korean and english and all ticket vending machines also have english options.Note that metro stations may be rather huge if you are transferring between lines and it can be confusing if you come from smaller cities. But just follow the signs and if you get lost, just ask someone. Altho koreans arent that good in english you ill always find someone who can point in the correct directions. Take note that escalators and elevator are not present every where so you will find yourself walking in stair plenty of times, even on the more popular stations.Tourists should take note of how the locals are acting on the stations and trains. There is a big difference from western behavior and asian behavior. Korean is not as extreme as japanese but there are still some things you just dont do. Dont block the door for people going off the train. Dont be noisy/bothersome in any way. Do not sit in seats designated for elderly or movement impaired even if they are not in use. Dont have your backpack on your back, but carry it in your hand and place it between your legs. And do expect a really crowded train if you are traveling in the rush hour."
Awesome!,The Seoul Metro system is outstanding. Very easy to navigate once you know where you're coming from and where you're wanting to go. There are tons of apps that assist you in finding out the directions you need and the lines you need to be on if you need the help. Usually there are also attendants in the stations that can assist if you're confused by the maps. Traveling by public transportation (metro or bus) is recommended in Seoul because the traffic is crazy!
Great subway transport system,Our friends who lived in Seoul recommended using the subway and they said its really easy. Well they are right! You can buy one off passes but your best to buy a T-money card from places like 7Eleven. Top it up with $ at the machine at the subway/buses machines. Grab a subway map. It's cheap. Really easy to navigate as everything is in English and colour codes. Trains come by every few minutes at every station. We would have taken about 20 trains over the last 2 days and not once did we wait more than 4 minutes at any for the train to arrive. For the bigger stations take note of what exit you want to take. Some of them have up to 12 exits which you'll need to pay attention to otherwise it's a bit of mish to cross roads etc. buses are also just as easy to use and can use Tmoney card on them too. Overall Awesome transport system!
"Pretty good, lots of underground ",Although not the most extensive it will get you at least close enough to most places a tourist will go. The metro is easy for visitors with English ticket system and signs all about. 
cheap way to travel around Seoul,"You can tell by the color and number of the different lines.If you know the name of your destination in English, you can easily get around the city by the metro.Be prepared to climb up and go down the stairs since escalator is minimal inside the station."
stations are marked in Korean and English,"given the traffic in Seoul - go metro. Faster than by Taxi. Very clean and signs are bi-lingual. The stations are also numbered, which makes it easy for non-Korean and non-English."
Seoul trains,Very good train system. You just need a map of the metro. However you have to learn how to use it yourself as there isn't anyone at the station to help. Sometimes you might find an officer but don't count on that. Once u know how the system it is very easy and best way to go around Seoul. I am traveling with my 2 boys 14 and 10. 
Absolutely great for getting arround,"Clean quick and efficient the Metro is great for getting around and provides access to a huge area around the city.I used the Metro everyday to get from district to district sightseeing and it took me very close to most places I wanted to see. I only ever bought single use tickets and they all cost just over 1800 South Korean Won with 500 refund on the ticket once used, therefore, a sinlge journey was less than £1. The stations have small maps on the walls in Korean and English and the signage is the same. On many of the trains there are monitors that identify the next station again in Korean and English.The ticketing and refund machines are easy to use and you can switch them into English.Things to be aware of, at some of the interchange stations there can be a considerable distance to walk and it is relatively easy to end up on the wrong platform, there are some stations where there are many stairs to climb but I saw lifts in many of the stations. I would recommend that if you are going to be intechanging pre plan your journey and list the direction of your next journey and the first station on that route. On each platform the signage shows the destination station and the next station and by doing a listing it almost insures you are going to end up on the correct track. I found that very few of the travellers spoke any English and like in most major cities they are to focused on their own thing to offer help.The Metro is a really good city transport system and a great way to get around, its is cheap, clean and efficient."
You can go to almost everywhere in Seoul,"Easy and cheap way to travel! The sign boards are in English. So if you know the name of your destination, then I recommand you to use metro."
More English is required,Very developed transport system and cheapest way to move in Seoul. Felt in problem that maximum instruction written in Korean language. Of course people in the stations are helpful to direct in a proper way.
Easy to use and very clean and efficient,Very clean trains... easy to use- buy a t card from the station to make it even easier.The t card dispensing machine is in the station next to the once off ticket machines. It makes it really easy as you just tap on entry and exit.. can add credit to this .. machines can be set to English.Trans feel safe and are very clean. We had an incident of someone trying to sell something on the train .. the rail police quickly dealt with the situation discreetly. It made us feel very confident and safe on the train.
Fantastic Network,"A very good way to travel within Seoul, especially during heavy traffic, rather than being stuck in a jam, choose the metro instead. Connected to almost anywhere you wanna go, just research and plan your route.Tip: buy a T-money card (saves having to buy single journey card each time if staying for a few days in Seoul) "
Easy Peasy to navigate on the subway.,"We got a T Card from the the man in the booth and loaded it up with about 15,000 won which lasted for a fair bit."
Seoul metro is easy to use an extremely efficient,"Getting around in Seoul as a tourist is really easy. You have two main choices: take a taxi or the subway (metro). If you take the metro more than once I highly recommend to buy a TMoney card at a self-serve kiosk. Switch the language to English on the initial screen and the rest is simple. It costs 3000 Won. Then charge the card with a reasonanble amount, say 10,000 Won and off you go. You can use the same card to pay taxis as well. All subway stations are labelled and announced in English and often (always?) in Japanese and Chinese as well. The network is amazing and the transportation is fast and runs very frequently. In the center you have one circle line (line 2, the green one) and then many lines criss-cross the rest of the city. In taxis it helps to have a card which shows your location in Korean. Do not try to use maps with English writing, that does not work. Pick up a card from your hotel concierge desk before you leave. They will also write down your destination for you.Have fun exploring this amazing city!"
"Easy to get around, efficient service","The metro in Seoul is the easiest place to get around. You can get a temporary card or a MICE card. Although you are charged an extra KW 500 for each temporary card, you can get a refund at the end of your journey. There are machines specifically for obtaiing a refund. The MICE cards can be topped up at all stations. The guide map is easy to follow. If you run into trouble, there are staff at each metro station who can help you. This is the simplest way to get around."
Cheap and easy transport,"Get a T-Money Card or a Cashbee Card (available in convenience stores, for example) to get an easy access to the metro (top up mashines available in the stations). You can also buy tickets for individual trips every time you travel, but one of these cards is more convenient. The fares are low (around 1250 KRW/1 € per trip, depending on the length of the trip). The Seoul metro network is huge and takes you anywhere you like, even to remote places on the coast or in the mountains. The announcements in the trains are in Korean, Chinese, Japanese and English. The signs are also in English, it is easy to find your way around. "
"Easy to use, a little bit hot!","You can go any where easily with changing lanes, there are maps everywhere that show you the vicinity. But it's just a little hot in the station. On the train though it's cool and clean.There are specific seats for the elderly and pregnant women and young people will give them their seats too. People are helpful and if they feel you need help they help you even if you are shy too ask. There was a lady who took us to the platform we needed to go to although she had to come down a lot of stairs and go up them again!Koreans are wonderful people."
"Great form of transport, a little bit more English would be nice","Great trains, very stipt, affordable. One big problem: not enough maps with station names in English. This is a real shame."
Efficient and reliable mode of transport,"Seoul is a busy city with plenty of cars and buses plying on the roads. So if you want to commute fast, Seoul Metro is the answer. There are nine lines criss-crossing Seoul, right from Tapseok in the north to Suwon in the south and Incheon in the west to Macheon in the east. Using a T-money ticket is a convenient way of moving about, do not forget to place the ticket on sensors as you enter and leave the subway station. The stations have numerous exits, the signs are both in Korean and English. The distances from entrance/exit to thee tracks can be fairly long. There are vending machines for coffee/ tea/ soft drinks in the subway station, shops and eateries. There are help kiosks in each station but sometimes, they were unattended. Inside the metro train, there are directions indicating which side the door opens and announcements in Korean and English telling which station is arriving and which line you can change over to. Exits are indicated in yellow, each line has a colour code. One day of travel can make one familiar with the system. There is mobile app in English that one can download to get a metro map. "
Easy to navigate and super helpful. Part of the experience.,"The Seoul METRO is the most efficient way to get around Seoul. Traffic in Seoul is pretty rough, so the metro is great. You can get to just about anywhere and navigating the system is very easy."
"Convenient, Convenient and Convenient",Seoul has very convenienct transportation system. I felt like metro comes every minutes and brings me every part of seoul with very reasonable price.
Very clean and easy to use,"We bought cards to use and they were easy to top up.We encountered a couple of problems with errors using them,but there was always someone at the stations to help.The trains were very clean and frequent"
Great transportation ,"It's a great help for me to visit everywhere in Seoul & Incheon for sightseeings!! It's so fast, clean & very cheap fare!! "
Not expensive and easy to use.,The metro is very punctual and clean. They put the train cartoon on the TV monitor for passengers to see where the train actually is. The only thing disturbing me is the English announcement in the train. The volume was so low. 
Amazing metro system,"The metro system in Seoul is truly awesome. Very clean and modern. Trains come approximately every two minutes on most lines. Signage and announcements in both Korean and English make it easy to navigate.Get yourself a T-money card. Can be reloaded at machines in every subway station (just select the English option if you don't speak Korean).I recommend downloading one of the numerous phone apps to help figure out your subway routes. The subway system is vast and it is overwhelming to plan routes just with the map. Coming from Toronto, the Seoul subway system is truly a dream in terms of public transit. Definitely the easiest and cheapest way to get around."
HUge But Manageable,Stations so clean. Maps to guide and help you. Cheap compared to US systems: $1.60 for many rides. Fast. Efficient.
"Safe, easy and clean.","All platforms have glass fences which only open when the train is there, so nobody can fall or be pushed on the rail. With the transport card you can go anywhere you want, check in and check out, the system is very good."
Easy for begginners,"If you know the English basics it's so easy to take the subway in Seoul. Just take a one-day ticket at the vending machine or buy a T-Money card at the closest convenience store (4000KRW), you can charge it the ammount you want at each subway station. The average fare for a trip is 1200KRW so i recommend you to charge 20 000KRW for a week. (Don't charge it too much, we never know if you lose it...)"
One of the best in the world!,"Seoul metro is one of the most efficient and cheapest metros you will find in the world, second only to Japan and Singapore, in my opinion.English signs and color coded lines make it easy to get around for western travelers.Lived in Seoul for two years and preferred using the metro and or taxi over driving which can be a very hectic experience.The station's tracks are not open air like most places in the US, so you are spared from the cold gusting winter winds. There are sliding see through doors that open and close to let you on the train when it arrives. Unfortunately, they these closures were not really intended to keep cold air from entering the station. They were created as a safety measure to help prevent people from jumping on the tracks."
So efficient,"We used the metro to go everywhere in Seoul, so efficient and probably the best of all the metro systems we have ever used"
Easy to navigate,"The metro is easy to navigate around although it is useful to take a map with you beforehand. The announcements are made in both Korean and English, otherwise they are on the ceiling of the metro. Pretty cheap to use and you pay a 500 won deposit for the travel card which you put in the card refund machine after your journey to get the coin back. The ticket machines have an English option and change is given at all machines. The metros are clean and can be quite busy. Once you get off there are various exits and there are either maps to show you the exit points or it tells you the tourist sight so that you get there in the quickest route. We used the metro the whole time of our holiday as it was efficient and relatively cheap"
Good way of transportation,Somewhat confusing to begin with but all the ticket machines and signs are available in English. It's cheap and very good to use when the traffic stands still above ground. However the cheap taxi's are a good convenient option for travelling between rush hours.
"Highly recommended, so easy to use!","We loved using the metro to get all around Seoul. Everything is bilingual and easy to navigate. Can get you virtually anywhere in the city, quickly. I wish our city back home was this advanced!"
E--FFI--CIENT,"Massive, sprawling system that is amazingly easy to use. Thanks Seoul. Other commuters were quiet and polite, often giving up their seats for our young children.It is by far the best and cheapest way to get around the city."
Cheap and efficient,Great form of transport really cheap and has huge coverage over entire area. I really love the songs/jingles played for different indications regarding the route eg interchange station etc etc
World Class,"Just like the services in Taipei, Tokyo, Singapore, the services and English speaker friendliness of the services is something you should consider instated of Taxi."
what's not too love?,"The Metro is quick, efficient, seems to go everywhere, makes announcements in English for those of us who do not speak the local language. True - it is loud! But efficient!"
"Easy, reasonable ","Easy to use and reasonably priced. Safe, air conditioned. English OK, they announce stops in English and major signs are bi-lingual. Although they have maps on the subway car walls, you should get a metro map to help guide you at first. Also helps to have Apple maps or other device for when you exit the station to get you where you need to go. They hold 500 won deposit when you buy a ticket, and I had trouble figuring out how to get a refund in the machines so I just lost the ~50 cents. Oh well! Don't be afraid, just do it!"
A must during rush hours,"The metro is a necessity during rush hours, so I tried it, although the first time I felt lost. However, once I the basics, I realized it is easier the anticipated."
Excellent ,"With the horrid traffic in Seoul, the best way to get around is by metro. They are clean, easy to navigate (announcements are in English as well ) and people can help. It is cheap and great. Just do it!"
Fast and convenient,"Seoul metro looks complicated but it sure is fast, clean and very convenient. There are english signs so it's easy to go around. "
try the metro,Self service but has English signs. Be sure to check where you're going and where you've come from as it's easy to become confused. 
Great Metro Service. Clean and well connected throughout the city.,Great Metro Service. Clean and well connected throughout the city. Good maps. Inexpensive and efficient.
Easy way to go around,Metro is the easiest way to go around in Seoul. It's comprehensive and cover large part of the city. I think metro is a first choice for budget traveler. All routes display and announcement do in English as well. So it's much easy. I have seen some bus routes don't do any English announcements or route display.
"On-time, clean and simple","After paying for a pass, you can easily move into Seoul by using its metro which is quite simple as soon as you get how it works."
Good metro,Its very useful public transportation. You can go anywhere with cheap price. Its Easy event you are traveler. Shoud use it.
Good way to get around,"Compared to other metros of large international cities, the Seoul metro is pretty good. Clean, newer, and easy to navigate. I especially like the AREX train from the airport to Seoul station."
Brilliant subway system,"What can you say about Seoul's subway system... it's amazing. Well signed, spotlessly clean, and super cheap transport around this amazing city. "
"Quick, pretty seamless.",Nearly every thing is in English. The app provided also helps tremendously. I could not have gotten around without it!
Clean and fast transportation in Seoul,"Our group decided to take subway to get to Seoul from Incheon international airport, at first it was really confusing to get tickets but once I get T money card at the convenince store, everything was easy! Metro is very clean and very spacious! And fast! One it took about 1hour to Seoul station. Also our tour guide told me that it's fastest way to go around Seoul! Now I get that!"
Good public transport ,"Not sure why this is rated TripAdvisor number 1, but it is clean, efficient and spacious - but that should be a natural thing and not something to rate. "
Only 2 stations up the same line ,"Feel like some sort of boffin for doing Hong Kongs MTR, Tokyo's Metro and now Seouls underground, it's deep, went down at least three escalators to get to wrong platform, the names are mainly 30 letters long and although the stations are surgically clean there's not a great deal of signs to say which way, but I did and that was good, again very little info on my train and they do express underground trains so they skip a few be careful !! But the funny thing is that the nice shiny plasticky ticket you get has a deposit on it ??? It weren't till my next ticket I read the small writing that said claim back your deposit at machine in station and as i walked through there it was and I got 500 won coin for each 35p each lol maybe my minces have gone south but I traveled all over the other two networks but don't fancy it here lol "
"Not the number one thing to do in Seoul, bht amazing transportation for sure","This is the number one thing to do in seoul... I don't think so. But it is the best way to get around. Its clean, efficient, very cheap and also the map if very clear and easy to use and the transfers are logical and lots of English signs everywhere way better than Japans system. You can literally go everywhere on this subway and even if you are out and about in Seoul you will never be far from a subway. The cheapest andost convenient way to get around Seoul. "
World most convenient public transportation,You could go literally anywhere with Seoul Metro at the SEOUL Metropolitan Area.Very clean and safe.Do- Must take Metro when you go to downtown (Korean traffic jam)Don't- Do not take Metro in the Morning rush hours (between 7 am to 9 am).
Excellent transportation system,Seoul is a very big city but the subway transportation system allows you to reach almost every area. The only thing I found a bit annoying is the transfer time between different lines at the intersection points: sometimes transferring from a line to another is a trip within a trip! Therefore take this aspect into account. And don't forget to purchase the T-Card!
Is ok,"It is very cheap to use and easy to get around. You can download the app and it tells you exactly what line, transfers and ETA to where you want to go. It jst needs better AC as it gets crouded of course at certain times but even when is not it gets hot. "
Fast & convenient!,"Hard to understand the system to begin with, but staff are very friendly and helpful and we were soon on our way around Seoul! Very convenient, comes every few minutes. We especially enjoyed the theme tune played when the train was near and thought the train picture thing showing you how far away the train is was a fantastic idea - they should do it everywhere around the world!Very few seats but makes sense considering how many people use the service - always packed. Very clean and no graffiti - we were surprised!"
The best way to move around Seoul,Easy and comfortable way to move around the city. The only issue is there is no elevator in every entrance.
Easy to use for foreigners,"Metros or subway is easier to use.Great connection.Have a small issue that some station have NO ELEVATORS, if you are travilling with trolley or handicap."
Efficiency Plus,"Rail is this next of the woods is first class with clean stations, punctual trains and easy to navigate network. My understanding is that the network could be the fourth highest people mover on the planet. It is done most efficiently."
Cheap and easy with air conditioning,"With the Seoul Metro being the number 1 thing to do in Seoul and a line being accessible from within out hotel (Lotte Hotel Seoul), we had to experience it. We figured out tickets fairly easily (a convenient English button is on the main screen) and spent about $1 each getting to where we needed to be. We bought single passes each time. If you return your single ticket to a machine at your destination, you get 500 won back for each ticket. This was easy and quick so we did it and you could tell some tickets were more used than others! Very interesting. We took the metro a few times and it was a good experience every time. The metro has air conditioning on it which was nice on a hot day!"
easy and efficient to use,"we got the t-money card at a convenient store. then paid to update value to the card. when you tap in and out, the card screen shows the cost of the trip you had and the balance value of your card. we went all over central Seoul and it cost 1250 won each trip. (Sept 2016 price). we then took the all stop train Seoul to the airport using the t-money card."
"fast,clean, efficient and cheap","buy a ticket at the machine, instructions are available in English on the touch screen. better still buy a tmoney card at 7-elevens and load it up at the machine. the map looks complicated but after using it a couple of times you will get the hang of it. one thing to note is that some lines run an express service and don't stop at every station on the line . the on platform boards will inform you if the train is an express and the map at the platform indicates what stations on that particular line are express stations by having them marked with a red dot on the line map. TIP: if you station is not at an express stop, take it anyway and get off at the station before then wait for the all stations train there"
It was very cinvenient way to look around Seoul,Seoul Metro is very comfortable and easy access to go any places in Seoul and you know price is very reasonable! Recommend to take seoul metro if you want to save some money : )
Handy,"Moving around Seoul, this might be your first option.You can do take buses or taxis if you prefer, though note that either transportation will bump into traffic jam at some point unless early morning or midnight ish. Not having any issues itself it's comfortable to move around.You might get confused though as the lines are cramped so do give yourself prepared. Only downside, the ticket vending machine is quite confusing and inconvenient.."
relatively easy,"Best vending machine ever with clear instructions on how to load the T money. Best to have the Seoul metro map app on your phone as sometimes may not be easy to find the metro stop on the map.Air conditioning could be limited at the platform and can be quite stuffy at times. We were there when weather wasn't particularly hot but was sweating while waiting for the train.Not all stops have lifts, escalators and long walk is expected. So think again for those with luggage or those with limited mobility"
Very nice but take care of similar names,"I made mistake of not concentrating on the whole name of the station. Try to make sure you understand that Euljiro is not only One station; there are several Euljiro's, for exampl: Euljiro 1, Euljiro 3, and Euljiro 4.Also Ichon is completely different (and far away) than Incheon!Try to use a big size map so that you do not mis-relate the names writen on the map with their proper corresponding station! Enjoy Seoul :)"
Seoul metro easy to use,"Some very modern stations and clean trains. Lots of signs in English, including on board videos that show next station approaching."
Need to figure out the system first,"Advantage:1. Cheap price2. Almost can get anywhere  Weak:1. Not all exists have a escalator.2. Some platforms are two-way, but some are single-way."
efficient grid under the city,"OK, you need to get acquainted with the names and the general plan of the city, but then you will easily and quickly find your way in this huge metropole "
Very helpful,Very helpful for transportation in different areas in seoul with huge network of stations (6 lines)..illustrated maps present in each station to describe your trip and arrival station.
"Easy, quick, cheap","Easy to use, sings in English in all stations, cheap and takes you everywhere in Seoul. Connections are fast. No need for private car or taxi when travelling in Seoul and are willing to use public transport! "
Very efficient and easy to use,Title of review says it all. Study the large maps at the stations and you will know which exit to come out of. Trains and stations are clean including the toilets. There is a nice musical signal to alert you to the train coming. Signs also in English. I wish we had a similar system at home.
English friendly,"For an american who has only made visits here and doesn't speak Korean, I find the subway very english friendly and relatively easy to understand how to get around. The signs and announcements are almost always in english and korean, and subway maps are posted in every car and throughout each station.Lots of small shops in the subway stations, especially larger transfer stations. Very nice way to get around the city, though it can get very crowded at times."
Easy way to get around Seoul,"This was our 2nd trip to Seoul. On both trips we used the Metro to get around. Very easy to connect, although there may be some long walks connecting to different trains at some stations. We found it very easy to connect to places all over Seoul. Definitely download an App so that you can map out your routes and see the whole connections through the city."
Nice and easy,There isn't much to say other than it was easy enough to get around. All the signs were clear enough to follow. 
Convenient And Easy,"Seoul metro is convenient and easy to navigate, but there are a lot of stairs to climb up and down especially while transferring lines. "
"Easy, clean, cheap","If you are going to stay a few days buy the travel card and top up as you need. Works for buses, taxis and more. The great thing is it works in other cities as well - we visited Busan. Take the Metro out to the National Park and take a walk up the mountains"
Nice Service,On time with nice service for elder and pregnant female.Excellent LOST and FOUND help desk. I lost my bag I got back within 40min.Thank to Seoul metro staff.
Easy to use!,The subway system in Seoul is very easy to use with everything written in English or available in English. 
Easy to navigate ,"Easy to navigate, fast, on time. Station names also in English if you require. Most places are very easy to access "
Gigantic metro,Ticket dispensers are in English so this is pretty easy. One way card is 500 won deposit plus fare but you can get the 500 won back is deposit machine. Tracks are like the US...look for the name of the place at the end of the line to figure out which way to go on the line. Very clean and modern. If you have 3 or more people....taxi is probably cheaper.
Busy and safe. ,"Busy place especially after office hours. They respected elderly, pregnant woman and have special seat for pregnant woman. The ticket u paid is included the deposit. So, once u reached your destination, simply return back the card and they will refund back your deposit. "
Very good and easy to use,"It's good and easy to use, even for those who don't speak English. However for larger groups like 4 persons, a taxi is more convenient."
Efficient and easy to use,"This is the best metro in the world. You can get anywhere in Seoul and even outside and the signs are multi-lingual so it is easy for all to use. The stations are conveniently located throughout and it is so cheap! Your best option is to download the Seoul Subway App which works offline, and tells you the times of departure, which is your best car to go in for transfers, where to transfer, and how long your trip will take. It was a life saver while I was living there! I lived and taught there for a year from August 2014 to September 2015 and it is the thing I miss most about Seoul (other than the cheap drinks and eats!). Do try to avoid rush hours if you are a tourist because the cars are beyond packed. Rush hours tend to be from 8am-9:30am and then again around 3:30pm-5:45pm. ALSO!! There are so many cool shops in the subway stations, you can get such great stuff (amazing socks!) and it is all reasonably priced. The best stations I found for shopping were Jamsil, Gangnam, and Express Bus Terminal!"
Seoul Tour ,Excellent metro services. You can reach to any location in seoul by metro. Seoul have 10 metro lines
Challenge your Seoul trip by using Seoul Metro,Using Seoul Metro is pretty convenient and almost access all corners and places of interest in Seoul. However be prepared of long walk between line transfer and many stations does not have escalator.
go anywhere on the metro in Korea,The metro is very efficient and easy to use. With a metro map you can easily explore all of Seoul using the metro. You do have to pay attention to the signs as the stations are huge and if you need to use exit #1 and and you use exit #3 you can end up pretty lost. But if you look everything is marked well and the people of Korea are very nice and always seem to try to help lost foreigners. The trains and busses then pass through the rest of Korea so the whole country is easily accessible via public transportation.
Best Metro I ever travelled,"The Seoul Metro is clean, efficient, reaches almost every spot in the city and outskirts, combines with buses. There are many shops underground also. I find it flawless!!!"
Clean fast and cheap ,Go down in one station. Find a transit card machine. By a card for 30000won (~30$) fill the card with 10000won and you can travel a lot. The machines only takes CASH! I found out today that apparently you can refill the card at 7-Eleven and use a credit card to pay with. 
"Highly efficient, great air conditioning and covers all the city",It is a big area - if you are going 1-2 km fine in a taxi but otherwise use this. Only downside is the Korean character set is so unfamiliar us westerners rely on simply the name and colour coding to get around. Some announcements are many stations are dual language but not always the case.
An easy way to move around in Seoul,"I tooked Seoul Metro everyday. Get a T money card and you can save 100won per ride. Just get a map of Seoul Metro or even easier just download the apps. Seoul subway apps will show u the exact time and faster transfer at each station. It is quite a walk at Seoul Metro as they have multiple exits (more than 10) at each station, make sure you know where you want to go. Famous destination exit will be shown at the station itself. Most exits required you to climb the stairs, but elevator and escalators are available at certain exit, just look for the sign. Water is refillable at most stations and some underground shopping are available too. Stations will be announced in both Korean and English and there is a LED signal board showing which station and door to exit. "
Seoul Metro/subways/railroads,"The quality and cleanness of Seoul subways are excellent. There are more than 20 lines covering both inner metropolitan area and near cities, and fare is cheap compared with other countries. .Longest lines take long like two hours and reach places 50 Kms away from Seoul. Interline transfers are ok without additional charges. Even transfer to/from buses in Seoul and Gyungido is possible with a proper bus card, which is sold in subway stations. For tourists, it is a tip to use the services avoiding the rush hours for pleasant travel and sightseeing. Also some parts of the lines, usually away from the metropolitan area run on the ground good for sightseeing. Weekends are far better to use when it is not crowded.Note that many major cities like Busan, Incheon, Daejeon, Gwanju have the metro services with similar fare systems."
"Good, modern metro. Lots of stairs, however!","A very good modern metro system. Covers a huge amount of ground and lots of stations everywhere. My main complaint is that boy, there are a lot of stairs. More so than some smaller metro systems."
Poor universal design,"Like HongKong, it's not accessible for oldies and disabled .. Need to walk a long way for transfers and stairs stairs stairs "
Nice,"The stations are huge and the trains are on time. Nice music playing when the train's arriving. Every stop will be announced with at least english and korean language, not sure if all the train have japanese and mandarin but some have it. "
Very easy to use.,"Other than walking, this is the best way to get around Seoul. You can take the fast train from the airport to downtown but the regular train is almost as fast and a fraction of the cost. You can also transfer for free from the airport line to the rest of the underground. We were staying in Insadong (at the Sunbee which is great) and we just transferred at Seoul main station to the line to Insadong. Most stations have left luggage facilities and one trick you need to know is that you can get cash back after you use your ticket. There is a separate machine that does this. If you can't work out the system, just stand there looking dumb and a Korean will come up and help you and try out their English at the same time. This happened to us half a dozen times in a few days. On the Metro it's amazing to watch the Koreans; none of them look anywhere else but at their phones and I took some photographs of a whole line of passengers, sitting identically, staring at their phones. "
"Clean, fast, affordable!","A group of us spent two weeks in Seoul and used the metro everyday. Other than there being multiple lines to navigate, it was always clean, always fast, and so affordable!! Also very safe - no open tracks, everything is behind closed doors! During peak travel times it can be very crowded (sardines in a can comes to mind), but if you wait just five minutes, another train will be right behind!The only downside was the number of stairs!!! Almost no one uses the elevators, there are some escalators, but more would be wonderful! Haha. "
Easy and Effective,Not as complicated as you thought it would be. It's a good exercise on how to travel by metro in lots of major cities around the world. It's simple and well planned metro routes that could take you anywhere in and around Seoul in a most convenient way. Trust me you gonna love it!
Amazing...,"The first time may be a little daunting but then it is so easy to get around. Just follow the signs for stations, transfers and exits. You only need to tell the difference from an exit to a subway line, and transfers are broadcast by speaker as you approach a transfer station. As you enter each station there are signs on walls or columns showing what track you need to be on which make it easy to find your way, or you can ask someone if the train is going where you want to go. The people in Seoul are extremely friendly. Also the trains come every few minutes so there in no waiting time for the next train."
Go anywhere you want,"Seoul subway is highly efficient, clean and easy to get by. I used during all my stay in Seoul and I was able to go anywhere I wanted. If you are staying for a few days I recommend you buy the T-money Pass. It's a subway card you can just charge and recharge as many times as you want and it works not only for the subway but also with some taxis."
lived here,used the metro on and off for about 3 years...on time..cheap fast and so reliable you can set you watch by it.
"Affordable, clean, well-organized and efficient","The Seoul metro system is very easy to use, even for a novice. It is very well-organized and the ticket rate is very affordable. You can use the metro map online to plan your trip in advance. The subway tunnels themselves are well labeled, too. Once on the metro car, it is easy to understand where you are and what station is coming up next. There are signs as well as audio commands on the metro cars. Also, the Seoul metro is amazingly clean and comfortable when compared to other subways I've used in the USA."
Efficient and safe,"Got a cute little card from the convenience store that I keep at least 10,000 won so I can ride without any trouble in and out of gates. I've only gone infrequently so I don't keep too much on it. Very easy to get around even if you don't understand Hangul...everything's in English! Platforms are very safe, they all have walls and doors so there's no danger of falling into the tracks, or of standing too close to the edge while the train is coming. Stations are very convenient, much more so than trying to park in downtown Seoul."
Efficient and extensive!,"Excellent way to travel around Seoul. It is fast, efficient and very extensive. It is relatively easy to navigate as well and not as complicated as Tokyo's subway.Be sure to buy the T money card."
Very extensive network,"Probably one of the most extensive networks I have come across.Very easy to use and get around. The only downside is lots of stairs - there are escalators and lifts at main stations, but not at all stations or interchange between stations.The T-money card is great and can be used on the metro, busses and most taxis. This card can be obtained with a small deposit at most convenience stores or the stations. Ask at your hotel desk if you need to know more."
Highly recommended ,Fast and comfortable. It brings you to almost all spots in Seoul in a blink of eye. You hardly need to take a cab. 
Efficient Way To Get Around,"The subway has wide coverage for a tourist like me. From Incheon International Airport to downtown Seoul to sub urban city near Seoul.Like many modern cities, the timming is punctual, and you don't need to take a long time to wait.It's cheap also. And by using T Money card, you can get a discount for every trip that you make.Something that you think about before taking this mode of transportation :- many of stations only have stairs, instead of escalator. So take a lot luggage to metro isn't advisable.- transfer between line in one station is quite far, and they seldomly have a travelator.- for going to satelite town, it takes lot of transfer line, and a lot of time. You may compare to the bus before take the metro.Instagram : @adjimantoro"
Excellent speedy metro with slight access problems,"The metro is efficient and speedy and comfortable. However, using the metro involves going up and down endless staircases and walking along a labyrinth of corridors. When we were unsure which train to take (which direction) it was very difficult to find someone who spoke English to help us. In the end we found it was more efficient and more interesting to walk to places from our hotel. But if you need to get to somewhere far from your hotel, the metro is really speedy and efficient, but study the map well before you begin your journey!"
It's a great help for everyone,The Seoul subway system is remarkable. It helps people get around and enjoy the city. You can get a prepaid card at any convenience store and skip waiting in long lines.
Round & Round,"Once you get the hang of things, it's probably the best way to get around, I used one-way tickets, but I believe a T-Money card would be a better option if you plan on moving around alot. There are 3D maps of the platforms along with a mobile app which helps a bunch. So you don't end up on the wrong side of the tracks, also look out for the fare adjustment machines if you plan on using one way tickets."
Usage Seoul Metro,We are a large family visited Seoul and we found it easy and cost effective to use the Metro. Clean fast and easy. 
Best transportation for tourists,"For people traveling to Seoul alone, for the first time, or on a budget: this is absolutely perfect. Get a T-money card (saves you ~100 won I believe) at a convenient store (GS25/7-Eleven) as soon as you can. We travelled to all locations we needed by subway, and it was super easy to use. The stops are written in English, and the screens inside also announce current/next stations. Download a Seoul Subway app as well! The locals are also very kind; if they noticed that a foreigner seemed lost, they'll help point/confirm the way to go, so don't be afraid to ask for help.There are often shops, food, and cafes between lines as well.The only tricky parts are getting used to transferring to different lines and finding the correct exit/side to where you need to go, but you'll learn after a few rides. Best of luck!"
Way to go!,Seoul metro is huge! Sometimes a little tricky when transferring lines but on the whole a fantastic way to get around the city. Use the T money card & be prepared for a stair master workout! Even though there are lots of escalators & lifts available it seems there's no escaping the many stairs. 
So Efficient,I used the metro in Seoul lots during my trip here and it was brilliant. The stations are all very clean and they are never too busy. They are very well signposted and there are English signs everywhere. The trains are really frequent and you never have to wait more than 5 minutes. Brilliant metro system.
Great way to get around,"Beautiful, clean, efficient and super easy! Highly recommend using this system. Got the transit pass eventually instead of buying the single ride tickets and that made it even easier. "
Good,"Very good, clean, fast and punctuated It was very crowded when I was there but people quite patient and quiet It was very good and new compare to other Asian metro I have used"
Easy transportation ,"Easy to move around using the Metro in Seoul, South Korea, by getting the T-Money card first and a map from the information counter.Inexpensive and easy way to travel to sightsee on your own. Several languages such as Japanese; Chinese; English and of course Korean are used in announcing the next approaching stop and which connecting line to use. "
First Rate,"Can you believe there are 19 lines. We took the all-stop train into the city from Inchon. I like trains and subways and I like to see parts of the city that you only see when you are traveling with the local population. The stations are well marked, connections generally are easily made. It follow the system of all subways, know what is the end point of the line you are on for your destination. Seoul also indicates over the boarding gates the next station on the route and that can be very helpful."
Easy access for travellers,Cheap and convenient but you will need help from locals to get on the right platform. Easily reach major attractions. Travel light as many stairs within stations.
Tourist Friendly Train,"It is easy to reach to certain tourist spots using metro. The train is fast and efficient. The ticket can be easily bought from the machines which has English languange options, but it will be much easier to use T-money here. I used up almost 15000 won of T-money for three days (11 times of using metro including back and forth to Nami Island). Whenever the metro is approaching a station, the will be the station's name appeared on the screen as well as voice telling which station it is in Korean and english languange."
Wifi (for $) and excellent layout,Despite not being able to read Korean were were able to easily navigate Seoul's metro system. It was very easy to use and is colour coded for routes. We bought wifi access cards from 7-11 type local stores for use on the metro. Metro is a great way to get around both Seoul and Busan.
Best method of transport around Seoul,"First thing get to know the metro map. If you know the name of the next stop you should be fine. Some of the transfers are quite long. The trains are 10 carriages long, it helps if you know what part of the train to board which shortens the transfers. The trains are clean and fast and packed at times. The fares are cheap and you get your deposit back for the ticket."
Super fast clean too,"We've used this a few times here, quite like the fanfare that goes off on trains approach. Busy during peak, but AC makes up for it. "
Very easy to navigate through it,"I was alone on my first day in Seoul and I decided to travel to Seoul through AREX, it was easy and cheap although I had to stand most of the 45-minute travel. I bought an M-Pass for five days which was good for buses and trains around SeoulFor the next 5 days, we mainly used the subway to travel and look for the places we wanted to go. the stations are announced in Korean,English, Japanese and Chinese so it really helped plus it was flashed on LED or TV screens inside the train.There were also signs of landmarks after you get off so you'll know what exit you'll use"
Easy to use,Purchased a subway card ($2.50 USD) and put $10.00 on it. We used it for 5 days and didn't run out. The system is easy to understand and navigate. The cost is much cheaper than other major city subway systems such as Tokyo.
A fine metro,It is easy to use and relatively inexpensive. Trains are crowded during busy times but it is a big city so that is to be expected. A nice modern metro that is easy to navigate and use.
Fastest and the most comfortable,"Well, Seoul subway is another story. For me, it is the most comfortable and fastest way of transportation in Seoul. It has 9 lines, each of them has its own color code.Subway map is quite easy, except a couple of twists with the different directions on the same line. However, if you take it 2 or 3 times, there is no way you can miss it. For tickets you can use vending machines, which have an English language option, but the most comfortable way for tourists is purchasing a T-Money card at the same vending machine. To summarize, I think transportation in general in Seoul is amazing, but subway takes it all."
Easy to Use,Good signage in English and Korean - read them or you can get lost in the myriad of exits. T-Money card is required.
SOOOOOOOOOO Easy,"Rode it the entire time we were there. No issues at all. On time, clean, easy to navigate. Don't be afraid to use it!"
Excellent,"Once you figure out how the metro system works it is fast and efficient. Metro smart cards can be purchased and reloaded right in the station. The stations and trains are clean and safe. There are maps in all of the stations, and most have restrooms and many have convenience stores located in them."
Variety of station qualities,"Travelled most of this rail system, as I often do in new places. For me, the numbering of the station's made navigating easier. Some stations in affluent areas were clean, modern, impressive.Others were filled with crowds, street vendors & food stalls.Still others were downright dirty and scary. Trains move fast, mostly on time, but often hard to get a seat. While the routes are long enough to be considered intercity commuter rail in the US, these are standard gauge subway cars with bench seats and strap hangars. Still, video in the ceilings, announcing in multiple languages, and Air Conditioned cars! I wish the maps on the walls of the car were larger print so you could read station names from a few feet away. "
Clean cabin,"Seoul Metro substation is connected with underground shopping, you will never feel bored. Fashions, accessories and many more."
So easy to use...,"I love the seoul train system. My 8yr old son and I took it from the airport in Sept-2016 into Seoul. About 1-hour trip and we paid around 7,000 won (@ $7) for the ""all stops train."" In an earlier trip (May-2008) I was able to use it to travel all over the city, without speaking any Korean or a l smartphone, ad they have lots of signs in English..even the ticket terminals have an English option. "
good,very easy to transfer the line!Good to organized with color.really clean and neat.air conditioning is good
Clean and Effective.,The station maps and information are easy to understand and travel is relatively cheap. Ticket purchasing is by machine with optional languages available.
Fab metro service,"The metro service is amazing.. so easy to use, especially if you get an app. It is also cheap and you can change the inter-connected lines easily. Just make sure you always have enough credit on your card."
"Plan your trip before taking the Seoul Metro. Too many coloured lines, too many numbers, too many hubs.","Best to get a T-Money card, to start off with. Available at most convenient stores. Each trip will costs you around ₩1250-1350.Plan your trip wisely, jot down the number/colour lines if there is a change of line to your destination.It took us approximately 3-4 days to get use to travelling on the Seoul Metro.We found that it is much easier to plan ahead, write down the necessary number/colour lines. It was a smooth ride on the 5th day."
"Very easy to use, even if you don't speak Korean","Especially if you are used to public transportation, the metro system in Seoul is extremely easy to use. At least in the area I was staying (Myeong-dong / City Hall), the stations are fairly close together, and the station entrances are well-marked above ground. The different metro lines are also color-coded, so it's easy to find the right entrance and platform. The ticket machine has an English button, and I had no problem buying a single-destination ticket. (After the exit, there is a machine where you can return your ticket card and get your deposit back.) The trains themselves were efficient and on time, and the maps on the platform and on the train also show the station names in English, so it's quite easy. While the taxis in Seoul also seem quite cheap, I think the metro is a great way to get around."
Great Subway easy to understand ,"So impressed with the Seoul Subway (Metro) system. The stations are extremely clean and well laid out. All signs are in Korean with English, Chinese and Japanese translations. One way tickets you get from the vending machine, again technology is there strong point. You pay for a deposit on the ticket and as soon as you arrive you pop it in the machine and it gives you money back. Most one way tickets for 2 cost up 3,900 Krw and you get the 1000 Krw back. Very inexpensive. Easy to transfer lines and you have to get use to the pushy nature of peak hour. What ever you do if the doors are closing then don't rush, the next train will be along in less than 10. "
Unbelievable.,"The best metro ever. Clean, reliable, Quiet and extensive. Very reasonable. Use a metro card which is easy to fill. "
Get you everywhere,"The Seoul has a very intensive Metro network that can get you anywhere within Seoul. It is very easy to get around, with both English and Chinese on top of Korean language. "
Transport maze,"Looking at the subway map, you would think it is complicated. In fact it is quite easy. Most of the main lines have english, korwan, chinese and japanese. The TMoney card makes travelling so much easier. However i have to say some of the direction signs when transferring were a bit confusing."
Super efficient,"By far the best public transportation I have ever experienced. Clean, on time and easy to figure out. Seoul sets the bar high for the rest of the world. "
Awesome city in the world,"Variety , excellent IT service , dynamic and hospitality Seoul citizen . We have been Namsan tower , cable car , shopping at Myoungdong , shopping at Namdaemoon market , Namdaemoon , Dongdaemoon market etc. we used city tour bus also . When we found good place for sightseeing , we get off there And shopping and experience and get on again to find another good place . I miss there! "
Some English please,"Although travel wit Seoul Metro was convenient, there are very little English and we had to find a local who could help us buy tickets and tell us where to get off."
Very useful,"The subways are very easy to navigate. The ticket machines offer services in several languages (Korean, English, Japanese and Chinese, I believe). Once you have entered the ticket gates, all the lines available at that station are accessible, but be careful because sometimes you must enter a specific set of gates to go one direction and another set of gates to go the opposite direction on the same line. Also, each time you buy a single use ticket, you will have to put a 500 won (about 50 cents) deposit on the ticket. Once you have exited the gates at your destination, you can pop the ticket in a refund machine and get that money back. Very clean and safe."
Seoul Metro is awesome! One of the world's best!,Seoul Metro is cheap and efficient. The trains go almost everywhere. You need to get a card but you can buy that at any convenience store or metro station. It's a small fraction of the price of a taxi and will likely get you there faster.
Cheap and efficient,"A great way to get around Seoul and beyond. Most journeys under £1. Very clean and efficient. Welcome air conditioning. A few stairs to negotiate, particularly on the deeper lines."
quick and clean,"Fast trains, lots of seats, cheap fares. Ticket machines have language options so easy to buy tickets."
Convenient and Accessible,"Seoul Metro gets you just about anywhere from one end to another in Seoul. There are a number of lines, so you would want to plan your route first before embarking on your metro journey. Signs and names of the stations are both written and announced in English. So it is really convenient for the non-native Korean speakers. Metros and trains are generally clean but you would need to prepare yourself for the stairs and long walks out of the station or to transfer lines. Tickets can easily be bought over the ticketing machine. It would be a whole lot easier for you to purchase the T-Money though to save the hassle of buying a tix every time you board it. T-Money allows you to top up the value when its low. "
Central Station with Duty Free Shopping ,I found the prices in Lotte Outlets more than other places even in Lotte Food Mart. It was very crowded specially Lotte Food Mart. 
Efficient and clean,"Great network, easy to navigate, super clean and safe. Bit crowded at times but reliable and very cheap. "
"Convenient, English and Chinese signage","Well connected, signage is friendly with English and Chinese, may need to walk a while for connection between sub-way lines, do take care that escalator and lift may not be available at all station "
The City that Sleeps,The metro is very easy once you know what you are doing and what to expect! Buy the card first in one of the convenience stores in the subway system - use the automated machine to load it with money using cash or credit card. Find your destination stop then find the last stop on the route to find the line. Tip; travel light as there are a lot of steps. Tip; lines can close after midnight. Tip; don't discard your travel pass card - you need it to exit and also you can use it to purchase other items.
One line ,I like the metro in seoul it is fast and clean easy to follow the line by the light inside the metro 
KORAIL,"The Seoul Metro is so far the best public transportation i have ever experienced. It's clean, cheap, safe and most of all, effective."
Efficient and effective yet inexpensive way to move around Seoul,"Unlike some mass rapid trains where it is charged based on distance, the subway in Seoul charges a flat rate of KRW1250 per trip regardless of distance. Quite easy to get around especially if you are staying near a station. Most tourist spots like the palaces, gates, museums, shopping (Namdaemun, Dongdaemun, Insadong, Iteawon etc) are next to subway stations. Tap in and you get charged, need to tap out still but nothing is charged. Use the prepaid cards to have a discount and it is very easy to top up. Card can be used on buses."
Convenient subway ,"The subway system is convenient for travelers, but sometimes it may be really confused when seeing signs without English "
Use the Subway; not a taxi!!!,"Seoul has an amazing and user-friendly subway system. Buy a pass card and reload as needed. Traffic is bad in Korea, so using the clean and easy subway is the most effective way to travel anywhere!! "
Color coded and very easy to travel,"The Seoul Metro will get you very close to or to the center of just about anywhere you choose to visit. Every hotel has the color coded destinations in Seoul. Make sure you get the pocket card so you can find a metro location near your hotel. This is a outstanding way to get around the traffic jams and the Metro is on time all of the time. The Metro will get you to all the shopping areas, hotels, and attractions. You will find taxis are available at all Metro stops. "
Main transportain in Seoul,U will use this if u go to seoul because its cheap and can reach almost all of tourist attraction in seoul
Recommend it!,"Trains are clean, safe, well air conditioned, cheap, and run often. Ticket machines in English were confusing. Not sure we ever really figured it out, but the minimum fare ticket seemed to work OK everywhere we went. They don't take credit cards but the cash readers worked really well. Don't forget to put the card in the refund machine AFTER you exit to get your deposit back.Only downside was many of the stations were sweltering hot. The trains were nice and cool though. "
best subway in the world,"wifi everywhere, data, and network even undergroundpeople are organized (rush hours excluded)very specious also, and one of my favorites"
Easiest way of getting around,Depending on how long you are thinking of staying in Seoul... Having a T-Money card makes life a little easier. It's convenient and easy to use to get around. The wi-fi cards that are sold all around Seoul work the best in the metro!
Cheap and very effic,We travelled around Seoul using nothing but the metro. For a short stay you have to buy single ride tickets. At the machines you chose the final destination and the machine calculates the amount of the ride and adds and extra KRW 500 deposit. Switching between the several lines is no problems with the card and at your final destination the deposit is refunded. Subways very clean.
Convenient but no stairs!,Convenient and easy to use for foreigners like me who can't read or speak Korean. However be prepared for a lot of walking between line transfers and lots of stairs!! 
One of the best !,"Seoul Station & City Hall Station is easy to move around to different part of Seoul / Korea. Get the ""T-Money"" card if you want to avoid having to line up to get the one destination fare card."
Very clean and nice.,It seems like that is the best way to travel around if you are going far. It may seem a bit complicated at the begining but once you get a hang of it is fairly easy. And at the station if you are not sure just press the help button the station staff are very nice and helpful.But if you are travelling around your area cabs there are ok price so give it a go too.
Very convenience,"I chose to take a train from the airport to Seoul. It s very good except the part that there is no escalator or lifts every spots. We needed to carry out suitcases walking with stairs. Anyhow, the services are quite fluency. You can download application subway. This will tell you which way is the fastest or changed less stations. Any new stations are pretty good, clean toilet. It s easy to understand how to use it. Need to buy a card n top up $$ in convenience stores. You can use this card as a debit card to buy stuff I e 7-11."
Efficient and Clean!,"I must say that for someone like myself coming from NYC where trains, busses and taxis-cabs are the main source of transportation for thousands of New Yorkers daily we definitely have a lot to learn from Seoul's Metro system. To start Seoul Metro is super clean, the stations- the trains and even the public bathrooms are nice and clean. The trains are neat, almost silent compared to BYC train system. There are shops in case you get hungry, need some shoes, clothing or something for the house. They are very detail and organized. Just follow the sings, the colors and numbers and you won't get lost. Stations have numbers which makes it easier if don't read Korean, Chinese, Japanese or English."
Best Subway system I've ever seen!,"If you're hesitant to ride the subway in Seoul, don't be! It's super easy, convenient, fast, clean and way better than taking a cab. Everything is in english and you can get most anywhere on it. Line 1 is a bit dirty but most other lines are very clean and well maintained. After living in NYC for 3 years, the Seoul Metro was like a breath of fresh air. Literally."
Its oky,I think their subway is awesome.Thay can eat.But they dont have esclaters..you may feel very tired..however it is super convenience.
Superb Metro system,"We spent four days using the Seoul Metro system which at first blush is huge. The system is easily navigated despite the myriad of lines available. Purchasing tickets is simple enough provided you always have 1,000 KRW notes and/or coins to pay at the machines, which do have an English language option.Trains are wonderfully clean; they are fast and they are frequent.Cost was circa Krw 2,000 per person per trip, so not expensive.Only bugbear is the absence of a multi-day/multi-trip ticket option and the need to obtain a plastic ticket refund after using single journey tix.Wonderful system in a magnificent city populated by kind and friendly people."
Very efficient with various languages ,"Very impressed with the initiatives of having various languages announced for every single station! Clean and well kept. Pleased to notice young people really observed social manners by not occupying priority seats saying for the needy ones, bravo Korean! "
Clean and easy to navigate,The metro is superclean and even though it is wast it is very easy to find your way since everything is in english. Transfers from line to line is thereby no problem. Made my trip to get around easily!!
Extremely convenient,"Séoul metro gets you anywhere in Seoul. Koreans are very friendly and the metro is extremely clean. Signs are both in Korean and in English, and you will always find an English speaking Korean willing to help you out."
Easy to Get to Know,"If you visit Seoul, and even if you haven't used subways much, you'll find this system very easy to learn and follow. If you need tourist info while in Korea, just dial 1330 and you'll get directions, bus info. and a lot more, in English. Have fun and don't worry, the subway here is easy to use, very clean, very safe, quick, and convenient!!! 5 stars for sure."
Convenient and cheap,The metro is pretty cheap and traveler friendly. I recommend you get their T money card (I got mine at once of the convenience stores at the airport). You just tap it when you go in and when you come out of the station.Its pretty crowded but well maintained.
"Good, clean and excellent connections!",Every thing is good for this metro; convenient and cheap. Stations / platform is hot and humid during the Aug month.
Super convenient ,"It is really simple to understand where each subway is going to. Use express subs to your advantage since it is a lot faster than the all-stop ones. You can get on express and then get off to transit on normal ones to arrive toward your destination. Also, do not get on subway when office hours are done (around 5-6pm), because the place will be super crowded and uncomfortable."
Most convenient Metro I've ever experienced.,"It's so easy to travel in Seoul City when you use BMW.You need not worry what type of BMW model car?When you really want this BMW in Seoul, it's so easy, convenient & economicalas BMW means simply like this: B(Bus), M(Metro) and W(Walk).Do enjoy your Seoul trip any time."
Good ride,At start it was a bit confusing as most of it in Korean not English but in the big singes you can see small English names .. It's better to download the Subway app as it very helpful once you know the station name you are in and the one you need to go to just jump from line to line if you went to the wrong one :) ..
easy and convenient travel,"We stayed four (4) days in Seoul and were able to visit most attractions by using the subway. We found it convenient, inexpensive and easy to use.We had few difficulties, and if we made errors, there was always someone willing to assist. The top up procedures for the T-Money cards was also quite easy. I would recommend the metro as the ""budget"" way to see Seoul, and also to interact with locals."
Walk and walk ,Exits are very long. Most of the stations which I visited were having very less escalators. So be prepared for climbing escalators on almost all the stations. Neat and clean. Easy access 
Fast and regular service,"Very easy to find your way around, nice clean trains, regular service with plenty of stations. A day ticket makes it very affordable."
Too hot and walk many stairs,"Although the metro is very convenience, not easy for transit line by line, as it is mainly to walk so many stairs and difficult to fine escalator and lift. "
"Seoul Metro, BEST in the world ","Seoul Metro is the best in the world. It is very easy to navigate as signs and announcements are in Korean, English, Mandarin and Japanese. There are even digital maps that allow you to choose which language you need the directions in.The Seoul metro is extremely clean. Another thing I like is that every station has free bathrooms and they are generally very clean. There are also very few delays in comparison to other cities' metros. Witt that being said there are things that can be improved. It would be great if the subway ran longer, had WiFi and if there were express trains. "
Convenient but can be complicated,I stayed in Gangnam-Gu during my Seoul trip so I was quite far away from the tourist attractions. I highly recommend you download a Seoul subway app which has maps and trip planner functions. Even locals use this as the lines and map can be a bit complicated. The announcements on the metro are also in English. Take care when changing lines as this can be a bit confusing. 
The best metro,"It is seriously the best metro service around the world. Clean, super organized and cheap. With a t-money card you pay 1200 won per each travel. If in Seoul absolutely use it!"
The best.,"Being from a major city in America, I am fairly well versed in public transit. In addition I have been to several different countries in Europe and all over Asia, and I must say that Seoul has hands down the best subway and bus network in the world.No one can top the coverage, cleanliness, ease of use, and foriegnor friendliness of this system."
Easy and clean,"It takes a while to get used to it, but it's easy, clean and safe. You can't access the rails which makes it safer. The washrooms were all very clean."
Convenient way to travel in Seoul ,We took a cab first couple of days but traffic was so bad in Seoul. We downloaded the app for subway and it was so easy to go places.
"You have to wait a while for a train, but extensive!","By far the best way to get around Seoul as the metro is super big... it's really extensive and easy to use. All stations are in English and stations are done by numbers so it is easy. They don't come as often as in places such as Hong Kong or London so be prepared to wait about 10mins. This doesn't sound like a lot, but with a journey with a few or more changes soon become annoying. This also means people run a lot when at interchange stations. So just be prepared! "
Easy to use and inexpensive,Easiest way to see every inch of seoul. Signage at stations are all in English as well as Korean. Very user friendly and clean. I bought a t money card and topped it up which saved buying single tickets for every journey 
Affordable transportation,It's an affordable and fast transportation but first you need to understand the places of the nearest station and how it works. I recommend using to helpful apps (Subway) and (Kakaometro)
In Seoul from Aug 9-16 - Not elderly friendly subway,Superb subway system but not elderly friendly as they are just too many steps and connecting station are far from one another requires lots of walking. The signage can do a lot for improvement and can be confusing for first timer user.
fast,inside of train is very clean and quite.Wifii service is very convenience while travel.To enter the tran the door is very safe.
WOW,The metro is great in Seoul now!! wish they had it 20 years ago like this. It was no where near as good as this. But the taxis are still relatively cheap. Especially compared to Tokyo Taxis.
Very easy!,"Take a metro map from any tourist information centre around Seoul, and just check from where and to where you want to go.. very easy colored maps - similar to Berlin's metro"
"Clean, always on time, really safe",The Seoul metro system is the best I have ever been on. It is cheap and efficient. It is safe and punctual. It's only downfall is that it stops operating around midnight. However cabs are so cheap city wide that it really isn't a huge problem and it preserves it's clean state. Most stations resemble hotel lobbies. They also have safety doors between the tracks and platforms to prevent accidents.
Extensive Network,"The extensive network of the metro system is essential to both locals and tourists as you can reach many of the places with little difficulty. The extensive network also means that the interchange stations are plenty and the walkways connecting different lines sometimes may require quite a walk. Many of the metro exits are not equipped with escalators. Visitors with huge luggage or after victorious shopping expeditions have to bear it in mind, as it is strenuous to have the loads walking all the way up the long staircase! "
Amazing Metro,"My god - what a fantastic subway system! Reliable, chap, clean and cool (when it's 35 degrees outside!). Don't forget to claim your 5000 won back from the refund machine after every trip!"
"easy to go, though quite full in peak hours","not recommend to travel with baby stroller in peak hours. Also not every exit is baby stroller friendly, so either you go in a big group to have at least 2 carrying the stroller up, or better to take a (Jumbo) Taxi. We decided to go for taxi after 1 day trying, as with the baby stroller and my parents, who cant walk too much, it is much more comfortable. "
Just great,Easy to get by. Everything is in English. There's a tram every few minutes. Take the T-money card and use it as much as possible. Seoul is huge and August is hot. Very hot.
Very clean,Trains come on time and very clean compared to New York and very easy to navigate even if you don't speak Korean 
Super easy way to travel,"It's quite easy to buy a single ticket or recharge card. There are various language options with English being one. For a single journey ticket, just choose your destination and how many tickets the it will tell you how much. Machines take notes and coins. For a recharge card, there is a different machine next to single ticket machines. It costs 3000 won to buy the card, then you take it out its packet, which also contains discount vouchers and put it on a recharge area in the machine. Put your money in and wait for it to top up. Once done you can print a receipt. The recharge card allies you to travel cheaper than the single journey so is cost effective if you are going to stay in Korea for awhile and/or use the subway regularly. If you buy a single ticket, take it to a refund machine next to the ticket buying ones and get 500 won back. "
Very comfortable and fast,Came last February for my visa trip from Beijing. The subway is more comfortable than Beijing's and is nicer with more colors. Definitely I like the transfer stations where you can do some shopping too. 
Easy to get around,"After traveling to Bangkok, Tokyo, and Osaka. I could say that the Seoul metro is probably one of the easiest lines/maps to travel. One thing I liked in the other countries, is their strict rules (no food/drinks). With that being said, I really enjoy using the Seoul metro train to get around."
No issues,"It was clean, always a train coming within a couple of minutes and also very good to navigate even for a person which doesnt understand a word of Korean"
Good Transportation,"The seoul metro is clean, safe, cheap and clear enough even for your first experience.The station officer was very helpful though not so many able to speak in English but they still try to help you to get to the the place."
Love the Seoul Metro!,"We live in Ulsan, where there is no subway so I was a bit nervous the first time we visited Seoul to use the Metro. But it is super user friendly, all lines well marked and clean, efficient. The trains run very frequently and people are courteous. "
Fast and clean ,Subway system is very good . You can have access to most places with subway. The train are clean and fast. Special seat for elderly which in crowded time people leave it empty for them. T money card is available everywhere and you have to use it in entrance and exit from system. Use the offline app for subway.
Efficient service,It took a while for us to get used to the subway - it operates a strange ticketing service by which you get a partial refund at the end of your journey (?) but it seems straightforward and efficient. We did not use it much because taxis are so cheap!
Traveling from Seoul to Daejon,It was very comfortable. You are allocated seats when you buy your ticket. You can store your bag above you if it's small however if it's a large sized suitcase alternative space needs to be found. You pass beautiful rice fields on the way. The train is clean. I enjoyed the ride!
Excellent transportation system,"The Seoul Metro is clean, safe, cheap and comprehensive. It is easy to use and find your way around and if you do run into any problems the staff and other users are friendly and helpful. The trains are large and frequent. Some of the stations are enormous and contain streets lined with shops."
simple. Use it.,very easy and affordable way of getting around Seoul especially in the heat of the Summer. Buy a card at a subway and then put credit on it.....couldnt fault it. Stops in English and said on the subway. 
Give it a try!,Very clean and easy to navigate. Be sure to use the deposit return machines after you use your ticket. 
Clean metro,"I live in Paris, so the difference between the one in Paris and in Seoul is like the difference between heaven and earth!It's really clean, there are no weird smells. A/C in the trains is a big plus, especially during summer."
"efficient, on time and ultra-clean","as written in the title , the subway in Seoul is really excellent:trains are on time and ultra-clean. The subway is well-connected to the main parts of the city we went to, ad also to other transportation means (railways, busses, airport (via special trains). One of the best subways I've seen so far."
Great and complex,"You should not avoid using it, since it helps you move across the city with easy. Each station is a large and crowdy underground market, where you can find almost everything. "
This is what public transport should be like everywhere.,"Clean, frequent, punctual, CHEAP. Seoul's public transport is an example others should mimic. Easy to get around, really cheap - about $2 per day on average. Definitely best way to get around the city. Tip - simply by a recharge card at one of the stations. "
"Clean, safe and fast",The perfect means of transport to visit Seoul. It is easy to use with automatic ticket booths in English.
"Great, definitely do it!","So we've bee on the subway not a handful of times but it makes transportation around Korea so much easier! I'm a big fan. There are stands there that help to translate to English but it is a very simple process. Also if you are elderly, handicapped, pregnant or with young children it is common for people to give up their seat for you. Getting down to the subway though is not stroller friendly at all. There will be steps and very few elevators. "
Best metro I've ever used,"The Seoul metro is amazing, it's very easy to understand, with live updates for where you are. The air conditioning has got to be highlight though!!!"
"Comfortable, air conditioned train cars that take you all over Seoul.","One of the world's nicer metros. High tech, comfy, wifi, air conditioning, heating, clean cars. It even runs on time. I can't think of anything that could make this metro better. "
Easy travel,"The Seoul Metro is so easy, cheap and convenient! Take you nearly everywhere, and no traffic hazzle. Very punctual too!"
Fabulous System,"I am really impressed with the Seoul Metro. Spotlessly clean, easily navigable and well air conditioned. I particularly enjoyed all the etiquette videos as well as the instructions on CPR and what to do in the event of a fire."
Easy to access.,"when you have a trip in Seoul, Seoul Metro is the best choice for save your time and money, b'coz many line of metro and can connecting to another line."
See the city with convenience,Living in Seoul without a car is possible. The metro is so convenient and accessible. The metros are safe and convenient. There are toilets in every station with toilet paper and safe to use.
Seoul Metro,Travelling in Seoul is such a breeze with the metro. If you have the app handy and know more or less where you are going then using it is truly a pleasure. 
review about metro in Seoul,"While in Seoul , everywhere we used the metro including to Incheon or Gimpo airport . The number of tracks is 19 lines . It is not difficult to use this transport , because the available instructions in English well to use refill machine T - money , at stations and in trains. The train it easy for foreigner to visit in seoul. i think very easy for a traveler to travel in seoul. "
Best Public Transportation In the World. Download the App!,"The public transportation system in Seoul was recently ranked one of the best in the world and for good reason. Go to the app store and type in Subway Korea and Seoul Bus. Both provide English versions, and both are user-friendly. Then, go to a local subway station and get your T-money card. You can purchase it at a kiosk usually located near the machines where you swipe your card to enter/exit the subway."
Convenient,"The best choice of transportation. Its fast, convenient and affordable. Went on a one hour train ride from myeondong to nami and it took me approx. 5,000 won. You could go places with this and save time on traffic too~"
Good transportation,"good way to get around, clean, and people were always helpful when asking for information. We found lots of people that spoke English. "
Convienent,1500 won for the whole day. Fast convenient and easy to use. Subway and trains are clean. Its a very efficient way to get around Seoul.
Transport in and around Seoul,"Once you get your head around it, this is an efficient cost effective away around. Get a travel card from any of the local 7/11's or similar, this covers bus's, bikes, trains, metro etc... charge the card up and off you go, remember though use the card on and off the metro and bus's etc.. if you don't the card still thinks its on the train ;) very easy way to get around and around 75% cheaper than taxi "
Complex,"Crazy getting about. Announcements were made in Korean, electronic displays were in Hangul mostly except for a brief moment in English. Missed it a number of times and had to take the train in reverse. The map which you would rely on listed above the train doors displayed the whole subway labyrinth. Had to squint to figure where I was but still couldn't figure (I'm a navigation idiot and it really doesn't help my cause). I thought Tokyo was complex, Seoul subway upped the level of complexity. Basically got lost for a total of 4 hours one day. The worst 4 hours of my life walking in circles and switching lines. Asking for directions doesn't help either, I'm either too daft or get pointed in the wrong direction all the time. "
the best transport system~,"Seoul has a very wonderful metro! It is clean, fast, and modern. It is also quite easy to understand -even when doing transfers. "
Jeff Thomson ,"As everyone said, an excellent service. My tip, download the metro app that shows the station numbers, it makes it easier to know which direction train you should catch (the number of the next station is above the door onto the train)"
Fast & efficient,"The metro complex is vast. Best to navigate it only with local help, as even the maps are confusing, especially if you need to transfer from one line to another. A big plus is that any transfer w/in 30 min of your start time is free. Also, peple 65+ ride free always. On the downside, it's both hot in the terminals in summer & cold in winter, altho the cars are comfortable enough. Still, if you travel very far, be prepared to be uncomfortable when in the stations. But for getting around a city as large as Seoul, this is the way to go."
"Fast, Clean, Simple, Cheap.","One of the best, if not the best, metro networks in the world. Very extensive, reliable, safe, and cheap! So helpful because it also uses the same fare card for any subway network in Korea, and even buses. So simple to figure out, it makes it impossible to get lost."
Super Easy,"Don't be intimidated by the map, as it looks crazy with many lines. The ticket buying process was very easy and the metro was clean and efficient. "
Fun to Ride,I love riding on the Seoul Metro. It's a great way to people watch as well as expeditiously travel around Seoul. 
Rude pushy people,"If you use this, watch out for old ladies who will push you around without any warnings just so that she can conveniently pass you. You can easily loose your balance because these ladies are very small and fast. They will touch you everywhere without any apologies. Also, they will take your seat right in front of you! These people will never never apologize. If you try to talk to them, they will certainly make a scene and other Koreans will help these people and not you who were violated in some sense. Also, rude Koreans will just pass you by a teeth of hair without any warnings. Of course this may result in hitting you hard as well. But they will never never apologize. Basically they are ""Ssangnom"" in Korean, and they never apologize for being a ""Ssangnom"".When the train stops, there is so little time that the people will enter inside pushing the people who wish to get out first. Also, the people are cold as possible and treat you with complete indifference."
cheap and easy,"Metro, getting a ticket from the machines.is straightforward with English language options. The stations and trains are clean fast and economical to useMake sure you read the map as to which exit you should use from the station or it could be a longish walk to where you want to be"
"Convinient and Clean, Very safety"," If you have an eye, just look at the other city's subway. Newyork? ha! Osaka? no screen doors and has hell-complex transfer system. Seoul's Subway system is the best in the world. I swear."
Great and efficient!,"It works really well, it was awsome to get evrywhere. It's always very clean and calm, and arrives every few minutes. Very comfortable as a public transport."
"Great System, U.S. Cities could learn from the Koreans!","Even as a foreigner in South Korea, I can appreciate a very good Train/Subway system, and really the BEST way to get around a very congestion city with a large population.POISTIVESCleanThe first thing you will notice is how clean it is everywhere. NYC & Atlanta should try to be as good as the South Koreans.English Signs & AnnouncementsYou don't even need to read or understand Korean. There are signs in English an announcements in English, but it always is nice to be with a Korean, I married a Korean.Good Value The system is a really good value compared to other systems in the world.NEGATIVESCrowded, especially during rush hour"
Don't forget the deposit refund!,"Seoul is prone to traffic jams, so the Metro is an excellent means of ensuring fast, efficient and inexpensive transport throughout the city. The network is extensive, and we found it the best way to get around. The machines are easy to use, and an English version of the instructions can be easily selected.Don’t forget to use the ticket machine again after completing your journey. It offers a deposit refund – 500 won is refunded on inserting your plastic ticket, so that it can be reused by another passenger."
on time,get a travel card and charge it with enough wan to last your stay. it makes it so easy to travel. And its faster than a taxi stuck in traffic
"Fantastic, clean, affordable","Seoul Metro is unbelievably easy to use, and even accommodating for arthritic grannies like me. There are elevators and escalators for pain free access. The maps are easy to read, and on the trains announcements are also made in English. Some of the underground stations are quite elaborate, with shopping and dining. "
Summer holiday,"Very nice timing and clean tubes, old lady always round with cleaning gears.Don't forget to return your ticket back to the deposit machine and get ₩500 cash back! "
The perfect transportation system in Seoul,"Spent a week in Seoul, first time there and ended taking the Seoul metro everywhere. Even from the airport took the express system. Very easy to get from one point to another. There is free wifi available on some carts and stations. Many stations don't use A/A so a little hot on summer times. Overall, the perfect companion. Be sure to buy the Tmoney card before you start using this system. Sold everywhere. "
The best transportation in Seoul!,"Having traveled to several cities in the US and have experienced multiple subways/metros, Seoul is ranked in the top 3 best subways I've ever been on. The other two subways include Boston and Washington, DC. Seoul Metro is considerably better than the metros in Chicago, Los Angeles and New York. The ""Subway"" app I use is so easy to use and allows to plan starting and stopping stations for the quickest route. Getting around Seoul would be so intimidating if it wasn't for the Metro!"
"Easy to use, don't be intimidated by language barriers","We found using the Seoul Metro very easy, just make sure you have a map of teh system on you at all times. Trains are denoted by the line (numbered and coloured) and the destination station, which is far easier than the London system that tells you east, west or northbound). The interchanges sometimes involve quite a bit of walking, but the trains are clean, regular and reliable.Buy a T Card, a contact payment card which you but credit for in advance, like many systems over the world. T cards can also be used on other modes of transport including taxis and in stores such as 7-11."
Need to get somewhere?,"The Seoul Metro is fantastic! I used it to get all over the Seoul area, even out to the Korean Folk Village. Purchasing a T Money card and loading it with won made entering and leaving the subway system a breeze. Unlike some systems, you only need to know the name of the next stop, not the end of the line, to be sure you're headed in the right direction. :-) Two favorite pastimes on the metro - phone use and sleeping!"
Best way to get around.,"Seoul Metro is great for tourists, easy to acess, quick, clean and inexpensive. Announcements are in various languages and signs for stations are romanised for us English speakers. The various apps you can download make it very easy to navigate Seoul as a solo traveller. "
Seoul metro is greatest in the world,"Fast and exact. So if you stay in seoul, you can go everywhere you want to go without traffic jam. And you can go to Mt. for hiking by metro. "
Easy move in Seoul ,We spent 5 days in Seoul to attend ACT program in Asan medical Centre in Seoul. The program was very exciting . After program we spent evening to see around Seoul by getting everywhere by Seoul metro that has access to every attractive places. Fare is cheap. 
Easy and fast,easy to get anywhere. You should get the T-money card and travel along without worrying or buying tickets when changing lines. 
Easy but not very iseful,"The metro is easy to use. Ticket Mahoneys in English, signs in English. But the stations and lines aren't helpful for getting around the city, in particular the tourist sites. Much easier and quicker to get a taxi and not expensive. "
Needs To be improved!,"We took Seoul metro only when we were there, every station is different ,looks like they were all built at different times. Most of them are really hot inside, air conditioning really needs to be improved! Changing lines is a pain, it's a long walk from one line to another and there's a lot of staircases! You often see older people or people with luggages standing halfway of the stairs to take a rest (more esculators please!!!!!), but I have to say that their washrooms are clean and there are enough of them around.It could be complicated when the subway lines are connected to some underground shopping complexes , make sure its the right entrance before you walk down the stairs! otherwise , you'll end up walking up more staircases!!"
"Well designed, but NO working air-conditioning","The Seoul Metro is designed really well to cope with the volumes of traffic flowing through on a daily basis. For line transfers, you will be expected to walk a far distance at each station, but this is understandable when considering how full it gets during peak time. For a claustrophobe, the subway is, however, unbearable. If the ventilation and air-conditioning worked underground, it would ease my claustrophobia - as it does in the Daegu subway system."
Be brave and try it,"By looking carefully at the signs, you can easily find which train is going the direction you want. Buy a T card, then load about $10 on it. This way you won't have to get trip tickets. South Koreans are sympathetic to confused tourists and can verify which train you need."
"Easy to navigate, goes eveywhere","A very well laid out and easy to use metro system. Went everywhere a tourist wants to go. Cost is reasonable, signage is in english also"
Can be a bit confusing,"We stayed 4 days in Seoul and it was the most convenient way of travelling once you get used to it. It can be confusing at first because unlike in London Underground, exits are named, here it is numbered. Otherwise, it is good experience."
One of the worse,Confusing and very inefficient. I don't know what they were thinking when they drew up plans to cover the area with this. Ok we are spoilt in London but hey. I suggest taxis as very cheap but they don't speak a good level of English.
Convenient,"It's convenient to travel around with the metro in Seoul. The carriages are wide.However, there are usually no escalators or lift to the ground floor. Therefore, if you have big luggage, it may not be a good choice. However, during transition sometimes, we needed to get out of gates and then paid again in order to transit to the next train. It's not a good point.For some lines, we could see some merchants selling products or religious people promoted their religions."
Efficient and clean,When in Seoul use the metro. The ticketing system is a little strange (how many people buy tickets and forget to get their deposit back?) and the stored value cards are always available for purchase. Not sure why you wouldn't be able to buy these from a machine.
It's complicated. Download one of the many apps to help you navigate it.,"It's very efficient and very clean. I know that English isn't used the way it is in Taipei, Taiwan, but it would help if the English alphabet was used more frequently to help people who can't read Korean script (namely most tourists). Unfortunately the apps we used only used english alphabet so there was a little bit of a disconnect with the actual metro signs. After a couple of days, we did get a better hang of navigation. When I did have some problems, most Koreans are more than happy to help you find your way."
Nice,Love the metros. A bit tricky to get perhaps if you are visiting for the first time with the refilling of card mashines and you have to blip your card twice. But you get used to it in just a few days.
Full with the subway line,"Transportation in korea is the best for me. They manage the transportation really well. U can go anywhere by subway (Seoul metro) and the price also cheap. Sometimes u will confused with the line also but korea always has a application to help us. The facility for disable people also good. U will has special price if u transfer from bus to Seoul metro , for student and also old people. Best !!"
William,It's very convinient public transportatiin.You can reach every where what you want. Museum and palaces and etc.
Easy to go to where I would like to go,It is nice and spread like web. I am using metro every days and Metro never failed me. I visited on time always.
clean and super language friendly.,"this subway may look complex. and it is! however it is very easy to get around, the signs are color coded for different areas of Seoul you want to see. each line (9 in all) has its own color and route, with a very easy to read map in English and in Korean. I am so happy with this metro system. by the far the best. it has never been late either. "
Stressful,"The train and subway system in Seoul is not well signed, often counter intuitive and a nightmare for parents with prams. Many stations do not have elevator access (especially the north side of the river) and the transfer are stairs only. My experience is also that nobody will offer to help and perfectly abled bodies and senior citizens will elbow their way into an elevator before a pram. When planning a trip, always give yourself an extra 30 mins for getting lost and carrying baby and pram up flights of stairs! "
Rotary,Excellent transportation. Efficient and clean. We had little difficulty finding out way around the city. Most stops are anounced in Korean and English. 
Great way to travel around Seoul,"If you have traveled in any major city, you can easily navigate the Seoul metro system. The exits are numbered, so it's easy to make your way to the different sights and to re-trace your steps. The one way card deposit is refunded at the end of your trip. "
Clean and frequent,Very handy system. Lots of different lines and connections. Good air conditioning and cleanliness. 10/10
easy and cheap,Makes it so much easier to travel around in Seoul during the day. The metro comes around every 5 minutes depending where you get on. It can get very crowded during rush hours. 
Came prepared,"In short - people do you research beforehand. First off you don't have to pay a cent when transferring between lines. The signs (by now) are all in English, Chinese, Japanese and naturally Korean. It isn't at all hard to navigate and IF you do check your stops beforehand everything is rather simple.One Korean man even expressed worry if I was okay and was ready to help. Pushing and shoving didn't happen with me (didn't ride during rush hour either). Noticed beforehand that there are signs about when the first train is and the last - again need to keep your eyes peeled. Also yes you do need to walk and climb stares, but by now there are also maps showing you where you are and how to get out or onto the level you need.By now also they have several lifts (reserved for the elderly, handicapped, pregnant or with stroller and injured) and also a gate for the ones in a wheelchair or with a stroller. It all works fine. Basically even the locals themselves need a map to navigate around."
clean,"clean and well maintenance, the rails are neat. The operators are careful when operating the train. So cool"
You Won't be Lost in Seoul!!,"You know i was amazingly amazed by their subway system. The route is too easy to understand, always right on schedule, maps are easy to read. Signs are always at least have 4 languages in it. So, people around the world do not have to worry, you won't be lost in Seoul!"
Very bad,"Probably one of the worse transport system I have come across. Long waiting time, directions all over the place. Astonished."
Convenience!,"For a non Korean speaking visitor, I had my original fears of using the metro. My fears all disappeared after learning how to buy the tickets n moved around. Further more, locals are so helpful ."
"Excellent, clean and economical.","Buy the plastic add on card and this can be topped up and used in shops to buy items. You can take the metro to either of the international airports in Seoul. If you have any balance left on your card, you can get the money back by going to 7 Eleven type of shops."
One of the Best Subway Systems in the World,"Clean, super-efficient, on-time, inexpensive, safe, easy-to-navigate. What more can a visitor ask for? I have used metro systems in many cities of the world - it doesn't get any better than the Seoul metro. Some subway systems are sort of awkward for a foreigner to navigate - not so here. We figured it out in about 5 minutes. Each trip is $1.25, which makes it the greatest of values. There is almost no reason to use a taxi in Seoul - we ran around the entire city for 5 days and the metro was the only transportation we used. Seoul is HOT in the summer, and the metro is nicely air-conditioned."
It's public transportation duh?!,I don't know what to say but Seoul has good public transportation and it gets you around town fairly easily without feeling so cramp.
Efficient and clean,"Great way to get around the city, the metro is probably the most modern, efficient and cleanI have seen. "
Accessible but can be better,"There are signs in English but not enough - for example, there is a sign that states Transfer in English but the station names are in Korean so as a tourist I have no clue where I am transferring to, which is not so nice especially when the platforms going to different directions are separate from each other. Meaning, if you accidentally went to the wrong platform, you have to get out from the gate, purchase another ticket again to go to the correct platform. Another thing is, not enough ground staff to assist."
Very easy to navigate,"Cheap and easy to navigate - a lot of information on stops in Korean, English, Chinese and Japanese. Clean and reliable!"
from a/b,the best +most economical way to travel around Seoul as a touristvisiting the sites. the roads are very busy and can take time getting around taxis expensive buses slow .
very convenient,"We had used metro as means of transportation during our trip. First, you should get a map of the metro. buy a card and load it with money and you may return it at the end of your trip. stations are clean. they have signs in english as well which helps and it is very well connected."
Hotel is close to subway,you are able to walk from hotel approximately 20 meter to get to the euljiro 3 ga the hotel close to mini mart and seven eleven.
Super easy and efficient ,"I visited Seoul for 4 days and made full use of the metro. At the first I was apprehensive thinking I'd be lost. However, the metro has very easy to use english translated ticket vending machines. It helps to download a metro map on your smartphone so you know your connection before hand. One you Purchase your ticket (between 1800-2500 won depending on route, lesser for kids under 12) you just follow the signs which are everywhere and very basic to follow. Several exists marked with attraction names so you know where to come out of. Don't forget to take your 500 won refund at your destination for your ticket. "
Train with unfriendly information for tourist,"If you are travel around using train in South Korea, you should have a map (have to request on information center inside the station), you have to count each station pass (coz no clue at all), you have at least can read chinese word coz most of information slide inside the train were written in chinese language.With less people understand English you have to depen on your map.But train is clean and tidy"
Seoul metro fabulous ,Having been on metro all over the world the Seoul metro is one of the best. Little detail that just shows they really thought about design function and safety.
Very good transportation,No breakdowns. Frequent. Relatively clean and various small shops littered around the stations. Makes seoul very connected. Download the seoul subway map to make things easier.
Convenient way to move around. ,"You can seamlessly move between korail and Seoul metro. We couldn't find a day pass, so had to buy a single journey ticket for each leg, return the card for refund of 500 Wan each trip. Signs are in English in most places ands in coach announcements are in English too. Best well be to carry a copy of map in paper or your phone to show to people while asking directions. "
Efficient metro system ,During our stay we used the metro a lot. We bought a card at the station which need to be loaded with money. After that it is only presenting your card at the entrance or exit of the metro station. All the stations have toilets which is very convenient. Metro system is very clean efficient. Stations are announced it Korean/ English and Chinese. 
Best metro in the world!,"Cheap, simple and reliable! After trying many subways in the world I can tell this is one of the cleanest and economic!"
"Goes everywhere, but good luck figuring out how to ride it","As a commuter system, Seoul's public transit is among the best I've experienced in the world. It's clean, efficient and expansive. I found it really difficult for tourists, though. If you know Korean, you'll be ok. If you don't (like me), it might take a while not only to figure out the network, but also how to enter/exit stations - seriously! Many of the stations are HUGE and trying to find the right exit that corresponds with the attraction you're trying to visit can be challenging. It's also hard to figure out how their various transport modes (subway, bus, train) connect."
Amazing Clean Cool Bright Safe Efficient & CHEAP!,"We used the subway to go everywhere around the city. We were blown away by how clean the trains and stations are - not a speck of dirt or garbage to be found. No homeless, beggars, thieves. Costs is like $1 to go anywhere. Air conditioning actually works on the trains. This is how all cities should be! We mostly used lines 2 & 5. Maps on the wall make it easy to see where to go (in English). Several stations have information booth with English speaker to help. Grab a map & booklet - tons of helpful suggestions in there. There is supposed to be a travel card that links to the hop-on hop-off bus. No one at the station knew about it. I think you can get it only from airport (travel is so cheap that you really don't save a whole lot...). On our last day, i found that taxi is only $3 fixed for 3 kilometers - so use that if subway doesn't get you close enough (or just to escape from walking in the crazy heat & humidity)"
Cheap and Efficient,The Seoul Metro is very cheap and efficient. Almost all of the stops have English translations and even the subway cars themselves announce the stops in English. Do yourself a favor and download a Smartphone App (I personnally downloaded the MetroidHD app) that has accurate times for trains and recommended and best path's for navigating to your destination. The trains are clean and comfortable. Be prepared to stand if you are travelling a long distance or into/out of the more populated areas.
"Clean, easy and fast","Well, it is just as titel sys, easy to use, very well maintained and fast if you don´t want to get stuck in traffic. Buy s card and fill up, instructions available in english, and you can call for help if needed.. Much better than metro in London or other big European cities we have visited... A-C available on all trains"
Similar To Metro in Other Cities,"Nothing special about the metro in Seoul, however I do acknowledge that the metro and also the metro station is clean."
"Easy to use, maps and English wording everywhere","I found the metro pretty easy to use, I was able to grab a T-money card and load credit onto it with cash at one of the CU convenience stores straight from Incheon airport.Somewhere in every carriage and on every metro station you'll find guides to the whole metro network and for each line, every station is labelled, and everything is in Korean as well as English, even the announcements if you listen closely enough.Although it doesn't hurt to have a plan before you catch the metro.Just a tip: the seats are built for thin Koreans, so if you're a bit more husky than the usual Korean, you may find it a tight squeeze to fit into the seats.Compared to getting around other Asian cities like Bangkok or Ho Chi Minh City or Manila or Yangon, you'll be glad to get from the airport straight to your accommodation and all around the city."
Well Planned System and Gets You To Places You Want To Go,I had a map and even studied that map and found this was a relatively easy system to work on despite needing to get used to the language. The only thing I was not prepared ahead of time for were two things: the machines don't take credit cards or American dollars so I should have put more on my T-Card first thing and there are usually 8 different ways to exit a station so you need to know which exit # to take when going somewhere. 
Fastest & Least Expensive Way to Navigate Seoul,"We found the metro to be faster, more efficient, relatively simple to navigate, and less expensive than taxis or buses. It was also very clean and safe."
excellent,"so clean and quiet ! very comfortable !It have a lots of informations in the subway, it have the air conditionning and the annoucement are in korean , english , japanese and chinese ! very helpful "
The best way to move,"During my two stays in Seoul, I've intensively moved from one spot to another. So, metro was my best friend: efficient, reliable, safe (as a female traveling alone and using it late at night), easy to orientate (every signs are in English)."
Easy to navigate,Clearly marked and regular trains are a part of this package. There are plenty of lines and they run often. Great way to get around the city. 
Efficient mode of transportation,Efficient ... though if you are used to Singapore or HK then you may find some of the subway cars a bit old. 
Efficient travel within Seoul,"The designers of this rail system has answered all the problems the public can face when travelling between different suburbs. Very efficient, user friendly and reliable"
Excellent metro ,Seoul Metro is - cheap transportation costs- clean - efficient - reliable - offers the announcement in four different languages 
Fast and efficient,"The metro system is fast and efficient. Subway is clean. Directions are clear. Most importantly, people are very polite to one another. For example, they will give seats not only to to people in need but to ladies too."
Reliable,"For the uninitiated, the subway gantries and transfers can be a tad confusing, and in more occasions than one, we got onto the train heading in the opposite direction from the intended one. Sometimes, there is a common waiting area for trains heading in opposite direction along the same line, while other times there are two separate areas for the two directions. Do read the signs carefully, even when you're in a rush.The frequency of the trains can be quite low at times, but they cover quite a distance in a period of time. There are designated seats of both ends of a carriage, do not sit on them as they are reserved for the elderly, disabled and pregnant. Do practise courtesy and give up your seats to those who need it more. The map on the train shows you which side the doors will be opening, as it can alternate between stations. It is an efficient way to get to where you want to go, as the buses can be even more confusing (and usually display the stops in hangeul only). We relied on it for most of our trip and have no major complaints."
Metro quicker than taxis (most of the time),Very convenient form of travel and the steps up and down show why Koreans are fitter and thinner than I am.
Clean ,"It seems to be complicated but trust me it is not ,very clean and amazing some of the sub trai are really fast hhhh"
Best way to move within the city of Seoul,it's a good way to travel through the city. It's fast on time. You have to use an app to find your way. there are not that many maps available. 
Easy going,"Really easy and cheap to use the Seoul Metro system to go anywhere in Seoul. It is clean, but can be a bit busy."
Oh metro,I advice you to use Google map because it help me a lot here in the metro I can right the location and Google will show you what the close station and the last one also how many station in between. You can buy the tickets from machine just you have to choose your next station .. perfect don't miss it
All signs are also in English,"The metro is very simple to use and all the signs are written in English as well. Distances between different attractions can be long so the metro is the fastest way to get from one place to another. Mind that the metro will be crowded during the rush hours. No matter how many people, do not sit on the seats that are marked for older or pregnant people. They just don't do that.Oh and your phone won't loose the signal even if you go to the bottom line."
Great,The best way to get around in Seoul. Prices are good. You can buy a travel card at the kiosk on the stations and fill it up or buy one journey ticket. Remember to collect 500 won in deposit on the machine beside the ticket machine after each Journey.
Good Metro network,"Besides taxi, Metro is a good transportation means to move around in Seoul. Each station has both English and Chinese names in addition to Korean. You only have to figure out which direction and which metro line you need to take, not a difficult task. The only headache is some Koreans, especially the older ones, may push you rudely either inside the metro or inside the station. You can really experience the real life of Korean and understand their culture."
Trip to Seoul,Seoul is well connected by metro. There are extensive and multiple metro lines and people usually doesn't speak English which might make the Travelling difficult if you don't have a metro map with you. The metro Map is given free of charge at the metro stations. The station names are written in English too. Some lines have train which will stop in all stations and express trains which will stop only in few stations. 
Great value,Buy one of their pre-paid travel cards (like the London Oyster card) and hop on and off as you please. Trains are very clean and efficient and best of all - air conditioned! Easy to follow lines in different colours and numbers.
Excellent,"Subway system here in Seoul can stand up to any mass transportation system of any major city. Seoul station collocates the subway, KTX and airport train systems all in one as well as offers the Lotte mall. Great arrangement."
"Clean, reliable, connects you to everywhere",Not much to elaborate. Subway system of Seoul is something I can be proud of. Use it if you are in town!
"Huge, with well over 200 stations","Cars are wider than usual, spacious, clean, relatively quiet, almost all with visual and audible station announcements in Korean and English. Easy to operate auto ticket vendors. Easy directions in Latin alphabet. This is the way to travel, as you avoid the inevitable surface traffic jams. At off-peak times, there may be some wait, tho, for the train"
Clean and easy Access,"It was my first time in Seoul and I must say that the metro station was really convenient and easily accessible to places that I've visited. However, the only problem was the language barrier as whenever I asked for direction the staffs couldn't speak properly."
The best I've ever used!,"Just by the T-Money, top up the card and you can just start your journey easily when you're in Seoul. To make your journey much easier, download the subway/railway apps in your smartphone, and it still works well even there's no internet connection. The signboards are in English and it's not complicated at all."
"Convenient, cheap, and fast!",I'm from Manila where traffic and public transportation is hell so coming to Seoul and experiencing their metro system is great! It can be crowded during rush hour but it's not much of a problem. Maps and guides to nearby landmarks are everywhere so it's convenient for tourists like me. My favorite type of transportation when in Seoul. Get the subway app for the best experience!
Intuitive and accessible to the Western foreigner,"I have used many metro systems around the world and this one is among the most intuitively understandable and accessible to the Western foreigner. Stops are in English writing as well as Korean (and Chinese, I think). The ticket dispensers offer English as well. Just as easy as Shanghai and Hong Kong. Much easier than Yokohama's."
Convenient to go around Seoul.,"There is map for the subway station from the counter at the airport. They have lines that come with colours for guest to find the stations and destinations.Very convenient once you got a map for the subway station which are available in English, Korean and Mandarin."
Very easy and organize,"Most organize metro in the world, very easy to go anywhere u want, have 4 languages all the time chinese english korean japanese."
Very Efficient,This probably the best way to get around the city and very convenient. Make sure you have your T-money card topped up and you are good to go!
Easy to get around using the metro,It was relatively easy to get around Seoul using the metro. The signs and directions are in English and easy to follow. There are maps to show you where you are. stops are also announced in English. The ticket vending machine is easy to use with English instructions. It costs around 2700 won for 2 persons to travel around the nearby stations. Get ready smaller change because the machines don't take any more higher than 5000 won and I don't usually see information counters at the control station.
You can get anywhere with this,it spreads out all throughout the city. affordable place to travel around but it gets really crowded on rush hours
Cheap and efficient,"Overall speaking, they are very good. It just some of the lines do not go all the way straight ,there are branches within the same line. You need to change platform even within the same line. Eg line 1 at Yongsan station everyone must get off the train and change . I was there and it was quite confusing. The smart card pay system is very easy to use but they are common in all Asian cities."
Signs & colours are somewhat confusing & contradictory.,The signs and colours are in both Korean & English. However the colours and arrows are confusing because the directions contradict the next set of directions once getting to the next platform. 
Fabulous!,"Excellent transportation system: immaculately clean, reliable, frequent trains and safe. In a city this populated, it obviously gets busy, but generally easy to navigate and problem free; buying a T-Money Card and using it instead of juggling cash is by far the best way to get around. They work on the Metro, bus system and many taxis; and they also work in Busan and some other cities.They are available at most convenience stores and often at hotels, as well as Metro stations and can be re-charged easily. Be advised that there is a limit on the amount that can be refunded if you do not use all the 'credit' left at the end of your stay! Travelers with mobility issues are advised to check the locations of elevator as not all stations have escalators to the surface. Also--check which exit will suit your needs the best as you will have to go back down the stairs and re-exit if you get it wrong! If you traveling with luggage, it is probably better to take a taxi, especially if there are more than two in your group, as taxis are still relatively affordable in Seoul and managing luggage can be challenging!."
Proud of Seoul Metro,It's super clean and cheap. It's easy to use. But the best thing about Seoul Metro is its safety. :-)
Easy to follow,"The Seoul Metro is easy to follow. There is metro map in Chinese character, Korean and English. Line is clean and there is air conditioning. From our experience, it's much more reliable then taxi as many taxi drivers don't seem to know where they are going."
"This is a tresure, not like in Tokyo. You could go with one pass!",It's very convinient to travel with the metro. The exhibition ceter was far awy from the center but with metro was easy to find it!
The way to go in Seoul,"Easy to navigate, with announcements in both Korean and English. You can get just about anywhere in the Seoul area very cheaply. The cars themselves have A/C although I do not think that the platforms do. It may not be the fastest way to travel around Seoul, but it is certainly the most sensible way to go check out different neighborhoods around the city. You heed to purchase a card to use the Metro and swipe it when entering and leaving at your destination. Buying the card is all machine-based, but there is usually someone around who speaks some English who can help you out with getting the right card for your needs. Note that the cards have a 'deposit' of 500 KWON built in to the purchase price. On your departure day, you can insert your card into a refund machine and get your deposit back!"
Recommended,"Seoul Metro is the best transportation system u can use while exploring Seoul. Have an easy map to be read by tourist, clean, and all access to many attractions."
Definitely one of the best in the world,You can explore entire city and the surrounding areas by simply getting on the subway from any station. You can also get on so called village bus at the stations and go to the hill top villages. Subway system is so extensive that you can travel to anywhere within about 100km from the city.
Great! But....,"I wish the signs were a little better laid out. I bought a ticket from one of the machines,tapped it, got on the metro then got to my stop and got off. I tried to tap my card to get out and it wouldn't let me telling me there was no more money on it. Tried to load more money on it, but was unable to as it was a one trip card. It was frustrating trying to make it to a meeting but showing up late because I couldn't get out of the metro! The Inchuan/airport line was fantastic and easy to follow. But as soon as you transferred to another line, it became a little chaotic. The lady's voice telling you the stops you can't hardly hear. You get off. You are underground, signs pointing you in every which direction, but they are a little misleading. If I do visit Korea again, I'd make sure to give myself more time to try to figure out the metro. "
Great and cheap,"At the beginning i was not sure if i will be able to use the subway. Since everything is in Korean. I found out that the metro uses English so its easy to use. And its really cheap, get your map from the hotel "
Confortable and fast.,"A smart grid that allow us to get any place of the city very quickly. The ticket can be bought in the stations and you must pay 500 Wons as deposit, but you can see your money back in the next station, depositing your ticket in the proper machine. Please be careful because the metro staff usually don't speak English."
A metro of stairs... and stairs,"The metro chain in Korea in extensive, connecting nearly every nook and cranny of Seoul. However, to the unfit-BEWARE. Each metro requires a lot of walking and is connected to flights of stairs. I believe the Koreans are very fit. This was at times a bit daunting for the unfit me. There were lifts but they were reserved for the old and disabled. Overall, great metro system!"
Easy enough,"as long at you know the name of the stop you want, its really not hard to figure out. Sometimes they don't stop at every stop on the map, so you need to make sure that the one you are getting on docent skip over your stop. Best app to use is subway korea by malangstudio."
£24 for 5 day ticket including airport transfer. Great!,"You just can't beat it. 5 day ticket to brilliant underground and buses .Fast, clean. Makes New York subway look 4th class at best!"
Signage,Overall the areas covered in Seoul are very good. The signage letters in English are too small to read from far. Circular lines sinages at the station should indicate west or east bound clearly. Many foreigners like us frequently get into the train in opposite direction.
Excellent transportation system,"Easy to use transportation system with information in english. I bought a T-Money card at the metro station and you can fill it up as you want in a vending machine. Easy and smart way to move around Seoul ( The city is traffic heavy, so metro is better than taxi ). Remember to swipe the card going in to the station and going out. "
The World's Largest (Track Length),"The station names can be a bit intimidating for westerners not familiar with the language. However after a few trips it is very easy to navigate. It is most important to gain access to a good route map with names in easily legible English font. The one supplied by a local hotel was the best.The Metro is actually a unified system of several lines built by different operators and KoRail the national railway. Due to this and the many stations and tracks, the attempts to fit it all on one page vary. But some are definitely better than others.When travelling try to remember the end destination of the line and the next station to work out the platform to board the train. Some transfer stations are on several levels as 2 or more tracks cross each other.Definitely worth getting the TMoney Card even for just a few trips. Saves all the hassle of getting single journey tickets."
A super great metro system,"Clean, efficient and user friendly, I love Seoul's Metro System since it covers a huge area and the announcements are made in Korean, Chinese and English. I hope that it could be 24 hrs though!I got lost trying to find a connecting line and the staff are super friendly and helped me out. Love it!"
A Convenient way to travel around,"From the display of the ticket machine, there is few languages to choose from, however, when you choose ""Chinese"" or ""Japanese"", the station names are still showing ""English"" at the end. I had experience of several Chinese/Japanese travelers asked me for help. Maybe can improve in this field."
taking the metro to most of the places,"great network, easy to travel, very convenient, cheap price, but lots of stairs to climb in the station.long walking between interchange stations."
clean and cheap,Extremely convenient but trains are often seven to ten or twelve minutes apart as opposed to other cities which have more frequent trains. But announcements and signs are also in english which is nice
"Excellent Subway, Easy to Get Around","I love the Seoul Metro. Clean, quiet and new. Although we had heard of crowded trains and pushing and shoving, we didn't run into any of that. In fact, the cars were very spacious and uncrowded for most of our trips. We did have one ride that was during a busy time, but nothing like I have experienced in Chicago. Very easy to use. Like most metro systems, you just need to know the end point of the train line you are riding for the direction and get on the train going that way. (I found it helpful to know the next stop on the line because that is shown above the doors prior to the train arriving. All stops were announced in English after one or two announcements in Korean. All the trains we took had monitors with the stops displayed, which made it easier to know what the stop was going to be.Tip 1: Get the App called Explore Seoul Subway Map, with a purple M as its icon. It has a map of the entire metro for free. I paid the extra $1.99 inside the app which allowed me to put in both starting and ending points and it would tell me what train lines to take, where to transfer (along with how many stops total) and the total time it would take to reach my destination. The extra $1.99 was definitely worth it for me because sometimes we ended up getting a train home from a different starting point than I had originally anticipated. I am sure there are other apps that work also, but this was the one I used and liked the best. Some apps I tried would do the transfers spots but wouldn't show the route on a map, or list how many stops prior to transferring. Knowing how many stops was very helpful to me.Tip 2 - The Metro has free wifi, however it does drop in and out at times. Overall it was fairly reliable to check on our location, check our progress with the Metro app, etc."
Subway ,"Within Seoul, you can travel to most of the attractions by subway which is cheap than taking a cab. However it will be a challenge if you have knee problem as a lot of walking up and down the subway stairs are required even though there are escalators available. Directions are in English, Japanese, Chinese and Korean. Also be prepared to stand during peak periods.. "
Easy to navigate,The public transportation system in Seoul is very user friendly and extremely easy to navigate as everything is written in both Korean and English. 
Efficient but ticketing system a little clumsy,"We used the Seoul Metro which, at the same time, offers lots of shopping possibilities in the underground space. The ticket cards are relatively cheap but their return is not really easy and evident for foreigners - this system needs some improvement."
Great subway,Took train to & from the International Airport - great to be able to book in my luggage at the station. Also used the metro. to go the Arboretum which meant changing trains - no problem
Good access,Lots of stops and cheap for rides. Gets you anywhere you want to go. Not so stroller or wheelchair friendly (lots of stairs to get between lines). Avoid travelling at 7pm when most people get off work it seems.
Easy travel ,The subway is super easy to use and all the lines make a lot of sense. I would say that it is really on par with the tube in London. 
Easy to get around and cheap,We enjoyed using the metro. My family saved money and did not have to worry about the horrible traffic. Took a taxi one day and it wasn't worth the cost to the metro. Plus we saved time. 
Average Metro,Not dat much good. very vibrating and noisy. speed is good but seats are not good. I think it might be old coach.
best transportation,it is best transportation in seoul. you'll go to anywhere in city.specially line 2 is circle round major sight spots.
Reliable,"Nice metro, reliable, punctual and always clean. In some hours is quite crowded but normally is not and is fast and easy to handle"
Good transport option in seoul,"we have used seoul metro for 4 days. we found it convenient for foreigners as most of the announcements and displays are in English also. Although its little expensive as compared to India. One more drawback is they don't refund the fixed amount for making transport card (about 30,000 won). So if you are going for 1-2 days don't make card"
Commuting,Other than needing assistance for buying the tickets the whole experience of travelling in metro was very smooth. The metro is very clean and runs at frequent intervals and signboards in English to tell you in advance about approaching stations
Plan your route,"Great way to get around in this massive city but be prepared. The signage is not entirely intuitive and the lines and tracks and exits sometimes are confusing. Plan your route in advance to minimize transfers as platforms are up and down with many steps. Some carriages are AC, others are not so bring a jumper if a long journey.Keep your single ticket which is refundable.Machines only take small notes but there's usually a change machine closeby. Take a photo or carry the subway map with you at all times. The underground entrance to subway may be far away and filled with long and windy underground shopping mall so don't get lost! "
London could learn from this,"Forget any impressions you may have of metro / underground in the UK, the Seoul metro is clean, efficient, cheap and easy to use. Buy a travel card from a metro station and top it up as needed, using the 'recharge' machines, where you can opt for instructions in English. Place the card on the top of the gates to enter the system. Fares are charged by zones, and you won't pay more than 1500KrWon per journey. The metro has nine lines (colour coded), plus an additional seven lines branching out into the metropolitan area (and out to the airport). Whilst maps of the system are in every carriage, the sheer scale of the metro makes these very detailed and quite difficult to read. The easiest way to plan routes and find your way around is to download one of a number of apps to your mobile phone. We found Kakao's app to be the best - easy to operate and view, and free to download. Most lines have digital noticeboards which announce the upcoming station, in Hanguel and English. If you need to transfer between lines, directions are clear, basically you follow the colour signs of the line you are transferring to. Escalators and elevators are plentiful. You may struggle to get a seat, the metro is heavily used, but carriages are wide and there are plenty of bars and grab handles. I'm not usually a confident user of public transport systems whilst abroad, but would recommend this as efficient and easy to use."
So clean... ,It was a pleasure to take metro in Seoul... So clean inside! And really not to hard... And everybody is ready to help you. Nonetheless not a lot of people speaks English :-(
Easy way to Travel,This is a great way to get around Seoul. The T-money card is easy to use and can be filled up at anytime. The maps to get around are easy to use. When using the system always know your end station and the next station in the direction you want to go. Both are needed to get on the train in the right direction. The metro will get you back and forth from Incheon Airport. T-money will also work on the city buses.
"You Know, Just Westerners Figuring Out How Best to Get Around","Why Can't, You Know, New York City - or Even San Francisco - deliver a modern metro system? Korea emerged from colonial feudalism merely decades ago. So, um, you know, what's our problem here?A sophisticated ticket-purchasing system, where your destination immediately knows your from-here-to-there-cost. BART asks unnecessary questions because it's not designed to understand users' traveling plans.Yikes! Gimme Seoul post-feudalism any day of the week..."
Great value but have your Google maps handy,A T-money card offers very good value and can easily be topped up at any station. At the larger stations with more than one interchange it can get a little confusing so have your Google maps ready. It can also be a long walk between lines and you have to go up and down on more than one occasion. The trains can often be full during rush hour so pick your time to travel. Notwithstanding the subway is the quickest and smartest way to get around the city. The trains are clean and run at frequent intervals.
Fantastic metro,What a metro covers all of seoul has nine lines all coloured in English as well. Very clean all air conditioning on trains. Nice stations. Use T card and top up.
Very efficient transportation,I must say that Seoul Metro is very convenient and easy to navigate where you are going. They provide English signage and announcement in the train is also made in English. 
"inexpensive and easy to use, English language available in the stations and on the trains","I use the metro lines 5 and 9 regularly and it's very easy for a non-korean speaker to follow the maps, recommend downloading an app to plan your trip"
Great for Tourists,The metro is easy to navigate and fairly cheap. It can take you anywhere you would like to go in the city. They even have an app (do not need internet connectivity) that will walk you through exactly where to get on and off of the train. It's fully in English and one of the most helpful tools if you don't speak much Korean but know where you want to go! 
Easy to use and cheap,"The Seoul Metro is safe, fast, reliable, and great for getting around Seoul. Each Kiosk has an English option, and you can search for your destination by English name. "
It's the way to get around,"If you have used the subway in NYC, Chicago or Paris it's a cinch to use. The stations are clean and modern and safe. You recycle your subway card when you leave the station"
Easiest way round the city,"You get a T-money card and top it up the machines in any station. All information (signs and announcements) on the extensive network is in English, Korean, Japanese and Chinese. Apparently you can also use the T-money on buses and Taxis and some convenience stores but I never did. The signage in the stations is clear and exits are numbered. There are special seats for the elderly, the disabled, the pregnant and those carrying children. Just make sure you check which direction you're going in! If you avoid the peak hours your journey will be easy. You can even use your phone in the subway. I wish we had such a modern efficient network in London."
Bring your walking shoes,"Upside - it connects the whole of Seoul. And the toilets are surprisingly clean. Downside - all the stations are massive and you can be walking for ages just to get to the platform or to changes lines. Use a T card to get around, they can be bought with cash from machines dotted around in the stations."
Efficient Transportation ,"The train system of Seoul is very efficient. Even a solo traveller or a first timer for this kind of transport can easily accustom oneself to roam around the city. Signages are well-provided. Just make sure you know the recommended exit for your destination, as there are several exits that you can take."
Convenient,"Very convenient, cheap, and efficient. Return your subway card for a refund on the deposit at the end of your trip."
Clean and Organized ,"We've used a lot of subway systems around the world and Seoul Metro is one of the best! The exits are numbered with points of interest/geographical locations listed for each exit (why don't they all use this system?!). It's clean, safe, easy to use and goes everywhere. "
Great way to get around,"Easy to use, convenient, clean, affordable!Can replenish your card (couldn't figure that one out in English) and when you're done using the card you enter it into a reimbursement machine and get some money back!I also witnessed older folks routinely giving up their seat for even older folk - it restored my faith in humanity!"
Longest metro in the world. Get a T card to make life easier,"One of the best metro systems in the world. Very clean, safe and awesome AC. Use google maps to help you get to your station it worked great every time. T card makes it easy to get in and out of stations and can be used on forms of public transport. Also, you can use T card in many convenience stores. "
Good cheap transport,Good metro. Pretty clean. Free WiFi at stations. Lots of stairs. But easy enough to figure out. Get an app for offline route guidance. 
Gets you there and back,"Seoul Metro, the greatest mass exercise scheme ever devised! Lots of stairs and walkways to get you from A to B. Crowded most of the time. But dirt cheap and gets you anywhere in Seoul.Tip: Get a T-money recharge card to travel on all public transport in Seoul, including taxis."
Super easy to use,"The metro was way easier to use than I anticipated. All the ticketing machines have an English language option and it is all very self-explanatory and easy. Besides, the metro stations were never that busy so I never felt like I didn't have time to work out where I was going or what I was doing. Clean, efficient and highly recommended!"
Convenient transportation in Seoul,The metro is vastly connected with most if not all major tourist attractions. It is a very convenient way to travel everywhere in Seoul city other than the bus.
easy to use,"In a country where it is so difficult to know what everything is - because one cannot read the characters in Korean. the metro was relatively easy because there were roman alphabet to the names. It does get crowded but dont sit in the seats reserved for the elderly and pregnant ladies as it seems the Koreans get very prickly when it is done. Because of the vast size of Seoul and to avoid the jams, this is quite a good way to go from one place to the other. "
Cheap and clean,"We found the subway system to be cheap, clean and easy to use. Everything is in Korean and English making it easy to get around. Download the Subway app, you can use it offline (title is SUBWAY and its blue). You can chart your route easily on the app and find the fastest or fewest stops for your route. We use the card, charge it with won and just scan as we go."
Excellent system,i have been travelling all over asia . Seoul transport system is the best and cheapest option i have so far encounter. It is easy to use (easier than Tokyo) and you can reach suburbs area fast and affordable price. it is really worth it. All stations are well connected and it is comfortable and not so crowded as compared to other system in asia
Good transportation,"My favorite transportation in Seoul. On time, fast, and comfortable. And also very clean. Their route is quite a lot to cover Seoul city."
Lots of underground shopping!,"The interesting thing about the Seoul Metro is the amount of underground shopping in the major metro stops. A good way to stay underground when the weather is bad. You can buy almost anything in these shops. The metro connection is extensive and you could go almost anywhere within Seoul, including connections to the airports. The only setback is that some of the older stations and interchanges are not very wheelchair friendly. There are long steps and stairs that would even be a challenge to the tired traveller."
"Modern, speedy and fuuuun!","One of the most efficient Metros I've been on...even though taxis area relatively cheap, the metro is just perfect for getting around among the locals during a Seoul Adventure! "
The best metro I've used yet,Better than any North America or European metro system I've used yet. So clean. The signs are a bit confusing to read to navigate transfers but take your time and look around as the info is always there but sometimes hard to find in English.
ESCAPE,"If there's a specific place to getaway. Seoul is the place to go except for summers since I'm already from Sunny Philippines. Shopping is fantastic. Weather is always nice. Food is totally awesome. It might be pricey, but if you know how to budget and stuck to it, you'll be fine. :)"
CityPass makes it easy,The CityPass scheme -- where you buy a rechargeable pass and just top it up when it runs low -- makes for the most user friendly metro system I've encountered anywhere.
easy to use.,Machine has English instructions. The unused T-card can ve refunded easily too. People are helpful as well. The exits are clearly marked. 
Easier than I thought it would be,"Visiting for a few days. Have been to Japan, Thailand, China, Taiwan..goes on. Honestly this competes with Taiwan with cleanliness. The train cars are huge! Seems to be on time always and English translations help a bit. Huge subway network but really isn't too hard to figure out"
All Tourisht atractions are near a Subway Station,"Plan your daily trip using the subway system. Pay attention to the number of the exits. For instance War Memorial Museum can be accessed from Exit 1 or Exit 12, but look at the map and you will that exit 12 is nearer and easier. Use Official Seoul Tourist Guide. It with tell you which station is nearear and which exit number is better. You can check also which exits have elevators if you need them. Take your time before deciding."
Well organizes Metro,The Seoul Metro is one of the best!This is one of the best ways to go around in Seoul.It is safe and very well organized.All the stations are very clean and toilets on each level.The signage are in both Korean and English.
Best metro system,I have been to many different metro systems around the world and Seoul is the one I compare them all to. It is really the easiest and best. 
Easy to navigate for an english speaker,"Easy to navigate for an english speaker. Extremely clean, quick efficient. A nice experience. Announcement for everystop along with screen and digital displays. Public transport for foreigners can be intimidating but the Seoul Metro does is best to be welcoming to everyone."
Very easy to navigate.,"The one thing about Seoul is that it can take quite a while to get around - so you might be on the train for 45 minutes. That said, it's well air conditioned and clean. There's an automated service that tells you what station you're coming into, in English, and there are maps everywhere to keep you informed."
Reliable,"Seoul Metro is easy to navigate. You can download an app to help you plan your visits ahead of time. I stayed at a B&B in Hongdae. I got this nice place for week that's just above the train station. So, it was super convenient and I didn't have to worry going back late. Keep the plastic cards and when you're leaving the city, you can feed it back to the vending machine and get a portion of your money back. I forgot how much was it per card, but it's good to do so since it's a trash away from the bin, and use those coins to buy a cup of coffee while waiting for your next flight. "
Metro service ,A great way to get around Seoul very safe and very well organised. I absolutely loved it. Different stations at different areas. I would recommend the metro always 
"Fast, efficient, accurate, crowded rush hours","The Seoul Metro system is in my opinion the best way to get around Seoul especially with the unpredictable levels of traffic you may encounter by bus or car. The timing with very accurate and predictable, and connected to most places within short walking distances. I almost had a case where I lost my wallet and the control room officer did everything he could to help me find it even thought it was after midnight. I later found my wallet in a restaurant I went to earlier.Only thing to watch for is rush hour commuter volumes which can be overwhelming and you have to be prepared to travel rather crammed and be prepared to be pushed in from behind. Outside of this, it is quite comfortable."
One of the best subway systems in the world,"I have always like riding mass transit rail systems, so I like to try them out in any city I travel to. Seoul's has to be one of the best in the world (tied with Taipei in my opinion). Even though I don't know a single word in Korean the signage was sufficient that I could figure everything out including the payment card kiosks."
Excellent system,"Although the complexity can be intimidating, this is one of the best Metro systems anywhere. If you will be spending any time on it, buy a T-card, which you can load with money and then not have to buy a ticket each time. All the ticket/T-card machines have a button that converts it to English. My only complaint is that it is sometimes difficult to figure which direction you need to go as the signage is inconsistent. Sometimes the direction will be indicated by the last station on the line, sometimes the next station, and sometimes by an intermediate station. So keep a map handy."
Amazing Metro,"Ok, taking the Metro takes a bit of getting used to... This being said, it will take you everywhere you want to go quickly. I'll admit, we were lost many times but we have found that people in Seoul are very kind and helpful and will help you find your way and explain how to naviguate through it. I wish our city had such an efficient public transportation system! Plus, no matter the crowd, the people of Seoul were always polite and considerate and we never were pushed in any way, even when we'd travel with luggage. Take the time necessary to understand how to use this Metro. It is really worth your while and it will give you an amazing experience of the way people live in the city!"
reliable public transportation,have t-money card ready for easy on & off rides. convenient and reliable. signage inside trains shows next stop and which side to disembark.
Very well connected - but brace yourself to walk a lot,"Seoul metro is quite well connected. However, there are limited/no elevators or escalators at almost all stations. Also, even for changing lines you have to walk a lot."
"Gets you everywhere, quickly","The Seoul metro is clean, connected, and easy to use. As soon as you work out how to tell which way you want to go when getting to a station, everything is a breeze. We used this extensively on our trip with no issues."
Perfect,Fast...on-time...clean...connects through the entire city...the cheapest option to explore the city...better to make a card.
Easiest system in the world,"Our rented apartment was just above the metro station and we took it everywhere...fast, efficient, safe and easy to navigate."
Subway System in Seoul,"Great way to get aroudn in Seoul without hassle. The walk between lines at interchange can be quite lengthy and you will nee 1,000 Korean Won bills for the ticket machines. "
Safe,"While I attended a convention my adult daughter made ample use of the Metro system to travel around Seoul to visit historic sites. She felt safe the whole timeIn the afternoons I would join her and found the Metro to be clean, efficient and easy to use. The signage on the streets and on the cars was easy to use and was in Korean and English.."
The Metro was great,"Cheap on time and stations near most major sites. Do remember to purchase a METRO Card and load up, the same in any large City. Journeys cost USD2 for up to 20km and were clean fast and station and train announcements were in Korean and English. Station staff were helpful if transferring lines, some stations had 3 lines intersecting."
Fast clean and convenient,Download the free Seoul metro app for your smart and take it from there! There are numerous colour coded lines and very clear directions in English at all stations. It is virtually impossible to get lost! Use a reloadable TMoney card which you can buy and reload at all stations from a machine.
Efficent and not packed,"Where I come from our metro is often packed, so it is refreshing that the metro in seoul is efficient and not packed. We paid for a city pass card for about 3000Won which we did not know it is not refundable. So be aware. Get the per trip ticket instead. If you have more than 3 persons, taxi is a cheaper and more efficient alternative in seoul."
very easy to use,By far the best way yo explore - our hotel was not close to the centre but the the metro got us there quicklyEasy to read instructions in english
Convenient but be prepared to climb stairs,Subway was my main mode of transport during my 6 days in Seoul. It brought me to or close to almost all the places of interest. Use the Seoul Subway app on your handphone and you will be an expert in using the subway. It gives good info on where to change train and estimated time of journey. Do note the exits to take to the place you want to go because they can lead you to places that are quite far apart. Be warned that many exits have no elevator and be prepared to take the stairs. 
Fantastic,"Compared to Tokyo and Hong Kong, the Seoul Metro works very well. The ticket purchasing system is by far better that Tokyo but Hong Kong might have the best cars. We were really surprised to see how good this system was. Of course it's better than the metro systems you'll find in NYC, DC, SF or Boston."
"Download the app, but a T-Way card and enjoy Seoul!","Super user friendly metro system: signage in English, free app download, lots of of public bathrooms to use and some food/convenience stalls in most stations. Tip: buy and load a T-way card from one of the convenience stores. The loading stations have multiple languages and are super quick to use. Once loaded, just scan and ride!"
"Clean, great signage, easy to get around","Cleanest metro I have ever been on. Well marked with signage, very easy to navigate. Felt very safe at all times."
"Clean, efficient and convenient","Very convenient to get around town, it is recommended that you buy the card called T money which can be used as credit card for the metro, bus and some convenient stores. It is available at any metro station. 2500 wons deposit and a minimum charge of 2500 wons are required. The card can be recharged any time. Google map gives you directions from one place to another by metro"
"Easy, convinient and very clean!","Used it to go to other districts and once from one airport to another. Easy to understand for aliens, extreemly clean, precise and modern!"
Fast and cheap,Good and fast transport system in seoul if on the way are just the traffic. Easy to find a ticket and buy it
"Not complicated, coverage ok, but many stairs to climb","Compared to some super cities like Tokyo, the subway system is not so complicated.Indications are clear, mostly with Korean, English, some with Chinese too. The in-train announcement is with Korean, Chinese, English.The metro covered most parts of the cities.The fares are reasonable.There are travelers pass but I didn't try it.Most of the stations are clean with toilets.Most of them do have the elevators for disabilities. But for common people, there are many stairs to climb."
SEOUL METRO JJANG!,"for me, countries with excellent public transportation are the best!and South Korea with its Seoul Metro are one of them.i, literally, went everywhere with this comfy rides!"
Great Subway System,"Clean, comfortable, quiet and easy to navigate. I used an iPhone app called ""Seoul Subway"" by MapWay. Made it even easier. Like many US subways, you need your ticket to get out of the station. Also, they must reuse the tickets as there is a deposit on them. Turn it in at the conveniently located machines at the exit and get 500 Won (about 50 cents) back. Adds up if you ride multiple times."
Clean and easy to get around,"The Seoul Metro is clean and easy to get around, the shopping in a number of stations are fantastic. It is like a city under a city, you can walk for miles underground with shops and restaurants. There are English signs in the metro, so it is easy for non-korean speaking user. The Metro line though many is very clearly indicated. Buying ticket for the first time may be a little challenging but after you done it once, it is quite easy to purchase and get refund on your ticket deposit. "
Efficient and clean,"Great way to get around Seoul. Cost is reasonable.I didn't see many subway route maps in English, however I use an app on my IPhone called All Subway. It is free and has every subway in every major city around the world. It's a must have for anyone traveling to big cities. "
World class,"One of the best, most modern subway systems. Trains are clean and comfortable, but can be absolutely packed during rush hours."
Great metro system,"System is clean and well organized. Easy to use. Maps are helpful. Lines are color-coded.If you'll be using it a lot, it's worth it to buy a card."
"Cheap, easy to navigate","Seoul's subway metro system is cheap and easy to navigate as many stations only have only 1-2 lines in them. The trains don't run as often as in Tokyo, but the interiors are wider. So as there is more time in between trains, more people pile up, but everyone fits.A Korail pass won't do you any good in Seoul, just get a Tmoney card and load 10,000 won at a time on there as most trips are only 1150 won each way."
Easy to get around!,"I'm from Australia and I loved it!!A friend and I went to Korea for a holiday. We got hold of one of the Seoul Guidemap Booklets which had the subway routes at the back page and we were off! It was very easy to read and get around on. The trains are fast and super frequent which made getting to our destinations easier. The transferring of stations was easy also, everything connected one way or another. The trains alert you when approaching the next station in English, Chinese and Korean which really helped as I don't speak Korean. Not difficult to follow the subway routes at all! Overall super advanced and impressed with the subways in Seoul!!!"
One of the best metro systems in the world but complex,"The Seoul metro is huge. Several lines and it is easy to get confused if you don't plan your trip carefully. The bad news is that you have to often transfer 2-3 times and you often have to walk A LOT while transferring, be prepared to get a lot of exercise. The trains are crowded but they are fast and clean. Signs are in English and Chinese as well as Korean. The system is well organized. "
T-money time and money saver,"Bought t-money card from Incheon airport from convenience store just outside arrival hall. They were able to register the cards for my 14 and 11 year old. Just show them your passports. No fuss, no questions. Activated the t-money cards when we reached busan. used on busan metro and buses. T-money card can be top-up at all the metro stations in busan, even at the convenience stores in busan. So t-money card is super-convenient, saves 100 won on every trip n no hassle. "
Good transportation,Very good transportation. Easy and fast. In each 10-15 minutes and never late while our travel. It's safely too and not too much people even the rush time. 
Easy to use even if you speak English,"The Seoul Metro is extremely easy to use if you are used to using any sort of public transit. The stops are labeled in both Korean script and Roman alphabet translations. the train announcements are in Korean and English, and there is a tv screen on most trains that displays the name of the upcoming stop.The train stations also have a helpful little chime to announce the impending arrival of the train.The only drawback to the Metro is that you have to use cash to buy a T card or pay your fare - you can't use a credit card."
"Clean, simple, extensive","Easy to understand all facets of the operation, maps were easy to understand, I don't speak or read Korean at all. Trains were frequent, every area of the City was accessible."
So easy to take the Metro,"I love taking the metro in Seoul, it's reallt easy and cheap. They will say the stops in English and the cost is about 1250 won."
Very convenient from Gimpo airport to gwanghwamun,I had flown from shanghai to gimpo. The metro is very convenient without any change to gwanghwamun....line 5
Authentic Indian Nepali Halal food with great taste and warm hospitality ,"Please visit Pooja Restaurant and enjoy unique food with great tasteWith popular Indian food including traditional Curry, Tandoori dishes Vegetarian & halal meals."
Easy to use and get around town,Seoul Metro makes it easy to understand how to get from point A to B in addition to being reasonably priced. Would recommend to anyone looking to explore the city as it is one of the more convenient public transport systems we have encountered.
One of the most complicated but efficient subway systems,"The Seoul subway had 9 lines identified by different colours. All the station names are written in english but the shear train line maps can look very complicated but it is very efficient. All major sightseeing places have a subway station close by.Get your T-card when you land in Seoul. It is available at both the airports. I read that even convenient stores sell T-cards. Seoul subway system charges on the first swipe/tagging when the journey starts. I always noticed its KWR 1250 per ride if you are travelling only on one line. If you have changed line, it will deduct an additional KWR 100 while tagging off. If you buy individual journey tickets you pay KWR 1000 extra per ride of which KWR 500 is refundable. In some stations, you have to tag off and then tag back in to change lines. When looking for directions to any place, read about which exit you need to take for your destination. Every station has multiple exits and each exit is far from other. It is very important to exit the station from the right exit in order to cut down you walking time.Also, it is important to know that there are multiple stations which sound the same but have small difference in their spelling. I was supposed to go to Banghwa station and landed up going to Banghak station and thus late for my meeting. So be very clear on what station and exit you need to take.If you are an iPhone user, I strongly suggest you download Seoul Subway app and download offline Tripadvisor Seoul City map. These two apps together made commuting in Seoul so easy. Any sightseeing option you wish to visit, look for directions on tripadvisor offline maps, it will provide you an option of public transportation and then lead to you the Seoul subway App. Once you open this app, it will show the train line you need to take along with the closest station to you.Just a note that Seoul Cabs are cheap, so if you are sharing your ride, it probably is cheaper to travel by cabs within the city."
Not bad,"Good coverage and accurate. Some older lines are showing their age and need investment. The stopping and acceleration on these are not smooth. Overall, a great way to travel anywhere in Seoul. "
Interesting but complicated ,"I guess our timing was wrong. It was a Friday at rush hour. Call me silly, but yes there where we ended up. We wanted to go from Hangdo to Sincheon. It was such a rush that we couldn't get help. Nor could we find a teller. It was just us and the machines. To go only one stop we had to pay 1000won deposit to get the card plus the fate. It was relatively expensive and we had no idea which direction to go. We decided to walk instead for 20 minutes.I think it would have been much easier if we had a local take us around the metro once to give us an idea how it works. Then we could have easily managed. Also from our hotel in Incheon it was quite a distance to get to the station so we never managed. Next time I guess. Good luck and ask for help or take a friend who knows what they are doing or you could get quite confused. "
Very good system,"Their metro has several lines and interconnected with each other so transfer with other lines is possible. Commuting to provinces are easier. Also it wasnt hard for me even it is my first time because it is very tourist friendly. Passengers are very disciplined. They wont sit on seniors/pwd seats no matter how crowded it gets if they are not seniors/pwd. In the escalator, everybody stands on right so people on the rush can run on the left side of the escalator. It runs smooth. And is very cheap! i recommend the use of tcard as it has discount. If your fair is 1350, youll pay only 1250 when u pay using tcard. "
Pretty easy and convenient,"Purchase a Tmoney card which is a store valued card that u can use anywhere from trains, bus and convenient stores.1250Won is deducted each time u go into the turnstile at the station, and zero when u come out.The lines of Seoul Metro are color coded.Once u know where u are going ( plus station number) , and the interchange u can see it inside the train.When the train comes there is music and an announcement.The red arrow inside the train will tell u which door will open. The attractions can be found at a map in the station and there are toilets too.There are some shops inside the stations including cafes, and convenience stores selling drinks, and socks ( for those who forgot) "
Wish trains from my home town ran like this.,Seoul's Metro system is definitely the cheapest way to get around Seoul. Most stations are situated close to Seoul's attractions so getting around isn't an issue. Overall easy to navigate and cheap. 
Easy to understand routes,"Select where you wish to go and plot the Lines on Metro to take. Different colour denotes different Line. Clean. Buy a Metro card which can be used on Metro and buses. The balance of unused amount can be refunded when you leave the country. However, not many people give seats to seniors unless you're with children or is pregnant. "
Easy Metro Lines,"Easy to buy tickets, great stations near hotels, very clean trains, connectivity to many locations. Good metro and fast system"
Simple and Efficient ,"Despite the complicated network, with an online metro app and knowing where you're going (we used the TripAdvisor map for reference), you be able to find your way around. "
"Possibly one of the most comprehensive, reliable and clean system in the world.","While the city is very congested by car traffic, the first-rate, modern and relatively new metrosytem in Seoul is the way to zip around the city and beyond. There are even connections to and from both Incheon and Gimpo Airports (otherwise hefty ca fares). Metro cars can get pretty crowded during rush hours but still, metro will beat any time (duration) one has to use a private car. Timely, efficient, inexpensive, reliable and clean. It is just about the only way to get around the city on time. Do some people watching, catch up on emails (if seated) and take a short snooze by leaving the driving to others. WIN, WIN ALL AROUND."
World class train system,"Very easy to use, well signed in English and once you understand how it works it is very easy to get around. You can go from one side of the city to the other and never go above ground even when changing lines. Google maps numbers each exit when you zoom in far enough."
"Once you get it, its self-explanatory with the English signs everywhere","Upon first glance, the subway map looks so intimidating and impossible (as with any major city subway system. But don't focus on the large picture and only see what you need. A: Where are you?B: Where are you going? And there's a English user-friendly app. You can view it without wi-fi, but to plan a route, wi-fi is needed. Wherever you're staying, just plan it out on wi-fi and you got it. in the subway stations, there are arrows & Signs everywhere to direct you for exits or transfers. Once you take a moment to understand it all, its simple. Even having a hand copy works for seeing where to go for what."
easy to purchase tickets and ride,the ticket kiosks are in korean and english so you can easily purchase tickets to go anywhere in seoul...and its cheapt too.our american CC didn't work so we had to pay cash.
Excellent Experience,"This is the first time even I have been to Seoul several times, I'd to experience Metro system of Seoul and I found the total system still lack of clear guildance to foreigners ex. English/ Chinese lables."
One of the best metro systems,"Very clean, not too crowded because they have so many lines, you shouldn't get lost as signs are in English and there are maps everywhere! Always know/ask which exit you need because they are numbered and the stations are huge so you want to get in/out at the right one."
Not easy for non Korean speakers,"Take a translation book or have a working translator app.This station was difficult to maneuver as a foreigner.It was very hard to hear announcements of the stops on the train. While they are given in Korean AND English, the noise level on the trains makes it hard to hear. (And I have excellent hearing).The signs on the station stops are not visible through each train door so you could not always read what you could not hear.There were rarely station workers around to answer questions and those there were not helpful in our experience.We were grateful when a kind hearted native stopped to help us and took us to the right place."
Amazing Metro,"We were in Seoul for a conference at the Kintek exhibition comp,ex- a long way outa town- in fact, the end of the line. But what an impressive system. Residing in Myendong, it was just a 15 min walk to Chungmaru underground station. Forget timetables- trains seem constant like, every few minutes. And like everything else, spotlessly clean, hi tech with everything signposted - including on trains, like...where you are, which side of the train to exit etc- in English as well as local languages. Sure, you'll climb vast heights at some places on escalators, elevators or steps. It's a great way to lose weight. Getting credit on your plastic train card is easy (also in English). The locals are respectful, quiet and seemingly organised. It's a marvellous way to experience or discover Seoul. It's a huge modern network and one of the best we've seen. Take a trip- you'll enjoy it."
Fast efficient and safe.,My husband and travelled around Seoul using the Metro for the 3 days we were there. We felt safe and were able to negotiate it ok speaking no Korean. Occasionally if we were looking puzzled a kind stranger would point us in the right direction.
Not always easy to navigate,"I recently used the Seoul Metro extensively. It's overall a great way to get around. As expected, it's very crowded during commute. My main complaint is inconsistency in signage and signs with the information you need aren't always easy to see. Train destinations should be very visible, I found that I had to really search to find them. One problem is there's so much clutter hanging from the ceiling that important information is hidden. Also, I had a couple of instances where I was following the directions to transfer, when suddenly, the directions just stopped, Clearer and more consistent signage would help. Otherwise, this is a huge and pretty good system. As a user of over a hundred subway systems around the world I'd give this one 8.5 out of 10."
Great way to get around,"Used the metro whilst getting around the city sightseeing. Very clean, comfortable, cheap. Certainly beats sitting in the traffic above."
So easy to use,"At first glance, it looks complicated. That's just because there are so many lines and stops. The good thing is that this mean you get get anywhere in Seoul using the metro. Buy a T card and reload it as needed at any of the machines in the subway or convenience stores (same as Hong kong's octopus card). The directions and verbal announcements are in Hangul, Japanese, mandarin and English. Figure out what line you are on (lines are identified by number and color), where you want to go and map out the connections. At each station, the name of the station is identified along with the previous and next stop with a directional arrow. This lets you know that you will be getting on the train heading in the direction you want to go. Connecting lines are also clearly marked and announced on the train so you will know when to get off the train. The subway is very clean and safe. It's also very inexpensive to use. I was there for a week, never used a cab, used the subway everyday, went just about everywhere and didn't use up the $50 I loaded on the card. "
So bright and clean!,"The Seoul Metro is very nice and clean. It has plenty of room to accommodate large amounts of people traveling, especially during rush hour. The metro system is so well connected throughout Seoul, that I never had to take a bus to get to where I was going. It does stop running shortly after midnight, but starts up again sometime around 5:30 a.m. "
Nice,Nice places .clean and attractive. The stations are all different one from another. Always on time. Never late. System is well organized. 
Rotary 2016 Convention,Very good transportation in a very large city. Whole subway system is very clean and well maintained. It is complicated for the novice tourist to navigate. Local people are eager to help and Metro Information booths are very helpful.
Very efficient. Easy to get around.,"I used this system to get from my centrally located hotel to Seoul's museums. It is extremely well organized, managed and monitored. Ticket buying is made easy by kiosks that include the English language as well as Asian languages. One tip for those using it is to make sure you not only know your destination's station but also the exit number. Some stations have a many as 14 exits so you will want to know which one gives you best access to your destination. My hotel (Hotel Shinshin)was very helpful in this regard."
Well connected,Seuol Metro is known as Subway. Its amazing network in different colour code/number covering entire city. If u r planning to stay for more than couple of days and goin to us public transport... then subway is best option. Do buy T Money Card and topup with some 20000KR Won to begin with....its easy and fast way of travel as u dont need to buy ticket... just show card at entry and exit. U can use this card for bus and taxi as well.
Easy,Easy to use and even more easy with the T-Money card that you can buy at 7eleven. Very clean and helpful to travel across the city which is very big. 
Get the map from Airport.. Will be extremely helpful later,"The Seoul metro are incredibly complicated. It is also comprised of some really old station which only have stairs. If you are carrying a lots of suitcases with you, maybe a cab to the hotel is a better choice.The color of the different line can be quite similar therefore confusing. The stations (directions) shown on the signboard also not the last stations, always check before you boarded.The maps will be extremely helpful from time to time.Some stations although operate by different lines but are actually extremely near and within walking distance. This would save you a lot of time transferring and changing stations."
Great experienced ,Traveling with friends for the Rotary International Convention. We had a great experience as the staff of the Metro was very helpful. Use a coloured map as you will not be able to identify lines with the black and white one.
quick way to travel,Pick the right time and travel early. It does get crowded but I had not problems with any of the people. Everyone was so polite getting up to let others sit down. Its pretty fast paced once you get off the train.There will be pieces of the routes displayed on trains and permanent wall maps along the way but I recommend you take a copy of the full map of the station routes with you before your trip and purchase a T-money card with money on it so you don't have to buy a ticket a each stop. Enjoy your trip.
A pocket friendly way to explore entire Seoul,Seoul Metro is almost every where in Seoul. Please download Korea metro app before traveling as very few people konw /speak English.
Complicated Network,"Old but gold. Trains are slightly old but very punctual and there's always seats available. I found their network very complicated with a lot of lines and it took some getting used to. Overall, I love the convenience of the Seoul metro."
Inexpensive and fun,"Add the Seoul Metro to one of the Great Wonders of the World list. Spent seven years in the Land of the Morning Calm and found the Seoul Metro system to be the best way to take in the culture, sights and sounds of this beautiful country as well as forge some lasting relationships."
"fast, expansive, clean, inexpensive","Love the metro, used it extensively for our trip. Clean, fast, modern and cheap. Each car had ac and wifi was very impressed. One could go without using a car during a visit to Seoul if they wanted. "
Key to Seoul,"It is not an attraction, it is the key to the city. It brings you close to all attractions including both airports. Excellent network, well connected and running very well. Some transfers require rather long walks, but the are very good direction signs. Local maps of the neighborhoods of each station is of major help. Seoul transportation card is a great convenience.."
"Very efficient, easy to use",Very easy to take the metro as long as you follow the maps (that are allAround). If you buy a single route you c get 500 won back at the end of the journey. 
T card,"Buy a t-card, life will be much easier. Also download the free application into your mobile. There are English signs everywhere."
trip by Seoul metro,"very glad for using Seoul metro, on time, very fast, clean, and so discipline.it can be the best choice to avoid traffic in busy Seoul "
Take the metro,"Seoul metro is the easiest, cheapest and fastest way to go around Seoul. Car traffic is a major concern there. A 10 minutes journey in the metro can take almost two hours in a taxi because of traffic. This is out of my experience!"
Excellent and best way to travel in Seoul.,"Seoul is a big city but don't worry. Metro is the best way to move. There are many different numbers which has own colors. At every stop you can listen the guide in Korean, English, Japanese and Chinese. Very clean and safe, The ticketing machine is avavilable at every stop and if you need a help you can ask the staffs, they will help very kindly. Try the metro or taxicab fare is cheaper than any other countries. Buses are a little difficult to use for foreigners except airport limousines."
Great way to get around Seoul,"I rode the Metro from and back to the Incheon airport. Transfers were easy. There are plenty of machines to purchase tickets. You have a choice of languages, including English. Train stops were announced in Korean and English. Plus the trains have maps on screens that identify the stops in Korean and English"
Excellent hub,"This is one of the best public transportations I have ever encountered. Everywhere in seoul is well connected and the apps work wonderfully. The entire subway is an engineering feat with its complex layout. It is very well planned. And much thought was put to it. Restrooms were well spaced. However there were not as many elevators as we would like them there for obvious reasons. Nevertheless it is a pleasure to travel with them.The busses supplement where the subways can't go. Hence interconnectivity isn't an issue here.By all means, get the T Money card. It is very useful. One can get the card at any convenience store. Get it when you land in Seoul."
good food good prices!,"besides myeongdong, seoul is also a place with nice and tasty food. there were sports stuffs promo when my wife and I visited there. crowded with people as well! "
Best Public Transportation System So Far,"Seoul has the best public transportation system so far. I have been around the globe and no other cities have such vast network of trains, buses, and taxis. If you use one of the local map apps (Naver, Daum, etc), you could pretty much get anywhere without problem."
Useful and functional but isn't easy to navigate ,"The metro definitely worth the try - it is the best way to travel in Seoul! Photograph the map before you depart - it will come handy when you need to establish where is next. There is a wifi at the stations - when it's working - the ""working"" part was rare, so I won't recommend to put too much reliance on it!The main activity starts when the train stops - everybody is in a hurry to rush in to take a seat - don't be surprised to be pushed and shoved so that a man behind you could claim the place to sit! On the other note, no one will protest or be surprised if you shove them to do the same. It can remind one of a ""gentle metro rugby"" game. The air conditioning is working really well, so if you are traveling for many stops - have a shoal, a jacket, or a jumper handy! Buy a T card; then, load it with about 10000 KWR - it lasted for 3 days of travelling around Seoul including getting to Incheon airport by train. The metro isn't too crowded, and the staff is usually available to answer your questions - if you could get past language barrier - they try with words and gestures - and of those don't work, they will walk you in the right direction! :) "
Easy and cheap,We went everywhere on the system - it is clean and safe and after the first time using the machines we became pro's at it - remember to collect your ticket refund
Best metro I have used,"Quick, efficient, clean, by far the best subway I have used. Stations have English language translation and the trains announcements and display screens also have English translations. Very easy to get around and cheap compared to other cities. Stations are also clean and efficiently designed. I didn't get lost once using it. Goes to all the major attractions you will wisg to see. You can download trip planners from Google play which help you navigate your way around."
Amazing! ,So easy to navigate! Be sure to download the 'Subway' app before the travel. Everything was translated and the signs were well displayed. Nice job Korea! 
Cheap and easy way to travel,"I took the Seoul Metro to visit quite a few places in Seoul. Sometimes the traffic can be pretty busy in Seoul and this makes the metro attractive. The prices were reasonable and one has to buy a card to travel. The metro is clean and safe, but the one down point is that the metro closes early on weekends"
Busy but excellent value,"Frequent, efficient, cheap city transport. Avoid the peak hours between 5 and 7 in the evening if you can!"
One of most developed metros! ,Better metro I saw only in Japan! Very developed and clean. A bit difficult for foreigners to memorize names of stations. 
A well connected city,"Spent a week in Seoul and used the subway system extensively throughout my stay. The cars are well managed and clean with free Wi-Fi access zones.It is a very cost effective way to travel, made easy by Korea Transit apps you can download for both IOS and Android. Enter the starting station and the station you want to arrive at and the app will show you the routing. One thing that you must look for in the app is information on the direction (end station) of the train on the line that are to take. This saves you time by following the signs with English that are very well placed in the stations. Can get quite hectic during rush hour!Oh yes, if you plan to use the subway quite a bit, well worth getting the T-money reloadable card. Simple to recharge at convenience stores and at the station kiosks (has English menu selection and will take bills). Can also get one at the Incheon airport. Again, saves you time by not having to get a ticket per trip. Just tap at the gate and go. Happy riding."
Easy to use,The Seoul Metro is easy to use as long as you prepare on where you want to stop. Get a T Money card easiest way to do it. I started using the metro at first the changed to taxis. The taxis are inexpensive as well. Just make sure you have the address of where you are going in Korean. Most drivers do not speak English. 
Subway,"Clean and wonderfully full of commerce! Everything from groceries to clothes, to electronics. Very easy to get around, even for a foreigner."
Best PT!,"The Korean metro is hands down the best public transit. Clean, easy to understand and convenient. I've used my share of transit systems but this is the easiest and safest. And it's probably want of the cheapest ones. If you hop onto a bus after the metro I believe the bus ride is free "
"Cheap, fast and convenient","A very mature and organized metro system. It is cheap and easy to use.I bought 4 T-money cards at the airport upon my arrival to Inchon, the store offered us the cutest type of cards which my daughters loved them and keep them as souvenir. Ask the staff if you are willing to pay another 500 Won. Although the hotel staff told us its cheaper to take a taxi for short distance for 4 of us, but the traffic in Seoul is not reliable, therefore taking the subway is our major transportation."
"KO-RAIL is amazing, clean and on time.","Korean Rail (KO-RAIL) is the train service in Korea. Fast, clean and on-time with minimal delays. If you have not had the opportunity to ride on the train in Korea, it's one of the better forms of public transportation I've used."
Easy to get around,"The stations are numbered with Korean, English and Chinese names. So very easy to get around and find where you are going. T money surely makes life much easier."
"Comprehensive, far-reaching subway system","First, the good stuff: from a tourist point of view, the Metro covers most of the crucial Seoul attractions, with the majority of sights within 12 minutes' walk of a station, at most. Ticketing is clear and multi-lingual (Korean, English, Japanese, and Chinese). Likewise, there are detailed area maps and useful related services, including lockers, toilets, and even breastfeeding rooms, in particular stations. Trains are reliable and spacious on every line I tried.The only reason it doesn't get full marks is the unpredictable station layouts. Some have more people-friendly architecture with spacious concourses and platform areas. Others are more cramped, with chokepoints around narrow corridors or escalators, disrupting the flow of people. In some interchange stations, it feels like the lines were haphazardly integrated, leading to VERY long walks. However, compared to the mess of the MRT in Manila, the Seoul Metro is positively utopian."
Most convenient,Most convenient way to travel to different places in seoul. Very clean and easy access. You can eat inside the metro which is quite good specially if you are going long distance places. 
Easy to use,Get a t-money card to save time if you plan on taking multiple trips. The staff at the entrances are very helpful. Most of them speak enough English to get you where you're going.Just be aware that sometimes you have to walk a long distance when you train change trains at some stations.
"Fast efficient, cheap and spotlessly clean","Frequent services, cheap, buy tickets as you go, no need for a rail card. Can get very crowded at times but this is a city. Spotlessly clean. Great way to get around "
nicely made,"very neat and tidey metro. doesnt seem so complicated. but you'll need someone to help you if it's you first time. once you get the hang of it, it's very fun and easy."
Good system,"Seniors have a reserved section at the front of every cab, the TV monitor informs you of your next stop and which side it opens. But for the lazy or spoiled traveler,be ready for long walks. Not all stations have escalators."
Easy to navigate ,Really easy to work out how to get from one point to another. Purchased a rechargeable card (3000) which makes it easier that purchasing individual cards for each trip
Very good system,Seoul Metro is very convenient traveling around seoul. Buy top up T-money card will cost you around $5 and keep refills it. It's very cheap travel around South Korea. Those T-money card also work on taxi and bus.
The main transport for your travel..,Seoul metro can't be missed if you're visiting the country. It's well connected to main areas and the fares are reasonably economical. *get a T-card for your travels and you can get the refund once you return*There's no timing estimation of the next train. But I'm always looking forward to the music it plays when the train is approaching. 
Good Transportation - Difficult for Foreigners,"The Metro Train System is wonderful, but e may bdifficult to understand the signs in the stations. Ask questions so that you get on the right trains. Not too many Koreans speak English, but those that do, are very willing to assist."
"Easy to Navigate, Inexpensive, and Very Convenient","We took the Metro daily during our 10 day stay in Seoul. It is very clean and easy to navigate. It may take a trip or two to get the hang of the directions of trains and exits but English labels are everywhere. Trips usually cost about $1,500 KRW so the price cannot be beat. Trains come often and were never uncomfortably crowded. Be prepared to stand as there are limited seats. Escalators and elevators are rare so be prepared to walk up and down several flights of stairs to get to train platforms. Maps are everywhere in the station. I recommend finding an official tourism map (white booklet) to help plan your trips. These maps are available in hotels and at the airport station. If you are planning on using the Metro often, I highly recommend getting a T-Money card to save a little on each trip and to make travel much easier. The cards can be purchased for a fee in the station ($3 USD). If you are coming from the airport, you can get a free T-money card with your Empress Train ticket at the information desk. The cards can be reloaded at the stations and a balance of 20,000 KRW or less is refundable. The 7Eleven in the airport offers refunds on the cards."
Best way to Navigate Seoul,"Clean, cheap, most effective way to get around Seoul. The best part is that the most we ever waited was about 4 minutes."
An extremely easy metro to navigate,"Compared to Tokyo's subway, the subway in Seoul is a breeze to take. As there are not as many lines and the routes are straighforwardly laid out, most (if not everyone) would not have a problem. "
Great infrastructure,The metro is the best way to travell around Seoul. All directions and announcements are in English as well as Korean.
Yay! Seoul Metro!!,"Sometimes u can see people are jammed in a train! But its only time that people go to work.. Usually it's pretty nice and clean, easy to transfer. It goes everywhere in Seoul and near city. Very convenient! "
Simple and organize ,"We are staying in Seoul for 10 days, it took us half of day to figure ot out but only because we didn't have a subway map. Now that we have one is very easy to understand-ride the subway. Very clean and well organized."
Absolutely great,This subway is capillar and very easy to use even for who doea not understand korean. Be sure to buy the card and use it to pay for the trips and the vending machine (you can also use the catd to pay for taxi)
Very efficient and smooth,A good metro system -easy to follow once you get the hang of it. Be aware though that when changing lines in some big stations there is quite a long walk between the lines. Very clean and safe.
"Convenient, clean, easy to learn","The subway in Seoul makes getting around easy. No need to rent a car; book a hotel near any of the metro lines (that's pretty much the entire city) and you can easily go to all the sites you want to see. It is very clean. When flying into Seoul, go to the convenience store in the airport (any of them) and ask for a T Money card - and then put money on the card - I put on 35,000 Won for a week's stay and didn't quite use all of it. You can use it for the bus and taxi fare as well. And you can use it buy things in the convenience stores, if you see that you are not using it all up. Change some of your money to won at the airport - as you need cash to charge the card. You can also refill the cards at kiosks in the station - I always go to the convenience stores, because they are everywhere and I can just hand them the card and the money to charge. Then you can easily learn the system. If you have ridden subways before, then you will be up in no time. If not, look at the subway maps in advance to get familiar. Everything is in English, Japanese, Chinese, as well as Korean. One key to getting good results is to know which exit number to head for when you arrive at your destination. You can determine this by either looking at the info for your destination; looking at Google maps to see which exit is closest to your destination and on the same side of the road, or looking at the map inside the subway - which contains major points of interest. Some of the subways have multiple exits (8 to 10). So it is best to know - they are easy to find. You will see the numbers listed; just follow the signs in the direction of your exit. After 1 or 2 rides, you will have it down."
We used it every day,"The most easy way to get around Seoul. Fast, efficient, clean and generally punctual. But very busy at times."
Extremely clean and efficient!,The metro was excellent! It was nearly always on time and spotless. Made getting around town super easy. 
convenient and cheap to go around the city,Going by the subway is super easy! We purchased T-Money card at the station and refill process by using automatic kiosk is fast and convenient. 
A very Efficient Way to go Around,South Korea metro is pretty good and very efficient if you really want to go here and there but sometimes a bit confusing if I compare to Japan and Hong Kong metro. Sometimes they make different destination at the same line with different gate so you really need to be careful and read carefully where do you want to go other wise you need to get out from the gate and get in again. And also the problem here is the distance between one line to another sometimes a bit too far so it may not be comfortable for people who don't get used to walking and travelling or carrying so many things. Also some station they rarely has an escalator so you have to walk a bit to find the elevator if you carry big stuffs. But overall is really good and the train quite frequent beside some lines which may only come every 20minutes.
Good but confusing at times,Used the train for the first time and it was a bit confusing at first. The English signs were very limited and even less with English speakers on the train. The trains are very busy even at night as it was fully packed at 11pm on a weekday. The trains are very frequent and it takes you to pretty much everywhere in Seoul that you need to go.
"not expensive, easy and convenient",The metro map is not complicated. You may check the numbered stations on the platform and then you may check the correct platform. Easy to ride!
Tough for foreigners,"I found it hard to navigate since I can't read korean. There is english in some maps. Once you get on, you find that you can get to the other side of the river much faster than by car"
Navigate the spider-web of metropolitan Seoul,"The Seoul Metro is a spider-web compared to Hong Kong's system, and interchange lines are quite far from each other. I guess this is only natural given the gigantic size of the city. More English signs would help, though."
Excellent subway system,"My husband and I used the subway system extensively during our recent visit to South Korea, and can't say enough good things about it.We also can't say enough good things about the many Korean people who offered to help us if they thought we weren't sure where we were going.It really helps to have a small map of the subway system, and to always know what exit you want to take to leave the station. (We learned this the hard way.) As the subway system is huge, you could walk a long way if you inadvertently take the wrong exit."
Convenient but avoid rush hours,"It's really very convenient but avoid their rush hours as you WILL be squashed! We happened to get on one at rush hour, and boy, were we sorry that we ever did. People just kept getting on station after station and the cars were so packed that you don't even have to hold on to the handrails. You simply won't fall even if the train makes a sudden turn or brakes. "
Best metro system I've ever seen,"-Much much cleaner than New York City's subway, but just as logical.-More frequent and timely subways than in Canada, but just as safe.-The downside: you'll have to take a taxi home of you go out late for drinks, because the train seems to stop working around midnight for some reason, even on Saturdays!Advice:-Don't be afraid to ask for confirmation that you are at the right place from the locals. Most South Korean people in their early twenties have more than enough English to help you out.-Pick up several copies of the train map in your language at the airport or a tourist booth around the city ASAP. They will make travel easier. "
Going by metro,"Is quick and convenient all the announcements are in Korean,Chinese and English. You will need your own map of the Metro stations in English since no English displays are posted. But it definitely is quicker than driving. It's also very inexpensive. "
Complicated yet efficient,"There are a lot of metro lines which makes the metro system complicated. They're overlapping. However, the train schedule is often and efficient. It's not that expensive too. Screens show the destinations and are translated in English. It is best to get a T card instead of buying tickets. "
Connects the Seoul,It connects every nook and corner of Seoul city. English subtitle available under Korean everywhere...Be careful the similar sounding names in Korean can confuse anyone. Hard to get the original up-to-date maps on the internet. I could not find any proper English app on iPhone.Try to get the T mobile card if you are going to use it frequently. It is available in the utility shops and NOT at the vending machine and railway counters...This card can be used in taxis buses and shops...Many stations are not completely handicap friendly. So elders and people with small kids be careful..Click helpful if you find this review helpful...Thank you...
Efficient and affordable transportation,"We used the t-card for shuttle bus from airport to hotel and All-stop train from Seoul station to Incheon intl airport. Everywhere else, we either walk or use the subway. Train starts 5:30 am. Very efficient and cheap way to get around Seoul."
Amazing metro system,"Its the best and easiest way to get around Seoul. I was there for 5 days and i bought Single ride tickets. I love metro systems so this was an amazing experiance for me. The seoul metro is clean, on time and fast. "
A great means to get around,"The Seoul Metro is a useful and cheap way to get around. All the ticket machines and signs are in both Korean and English, so fairly easy to work out. Just need good eyesight, as the route maps on board the trains are really small lettering, difficult to read even close up."
Convenient mode of transportation ,There is no doubt Seoul Metro is a convenient mode of transportation. Seoul traffic can be congested. Hopping onto metro will cut down unnecessary time sitting in traffic. Metro stations are also popular meeting places. My recommendation is to download a Seoul metro app before visiting. 
very convenient,Connect you to & from the Incheon airport and most of the sight-seeing spot. Very convenient. Ticket purchase at the machine is a piece of cake.
Excellent Transportation System,When in Seoul we use the Metro extensively. We are 7 in our group of 3 adults and 4 teens and we find the metro easy to use and navigate. We purchase the T money card and just reload when needed. Very reliable public transport
Very Impressed...,The Metro System in Seoul is so impressive. It makes traveling around the city so easy without a car. I wish we have a system like this in the USA.
"On time, Nice staff, easy to get from place to place","Dear Android user, you can download Seoul Metro official apps on app store! Easy to use and plan your trip. :)The apps icon is yellow in color with word ""Subway"""
"Clean, efficient, economical","You can get around Seoul with ease and on the cheap using pre-paid Metro cards. People are polite, there is no graffiti, no urine smell, restrooms are clean...what's not to love!"
Great way to travel around Seoul,"I travelled around Seoul for one week and used this public transport literally everyday. It's so convenient, fast and easy. You can download the Subway Korea App and decide which station you are traveling to. It will show you the fastest way, or the most convenient way and even the duration of travel. So you just need to change lines according to suggestions. The stations are labelled with number so if you don't remember the name of the station, you just need to remember the number. The station names are written in Korean, mandarin and English. At each station, they have a map showing the attractions around the station and which exit to take. So convenient for tourists like us.The metro is very frequent. The train is clean, comfortable and has announcement in Korean and English. Most of the station has only staircase so in case you have a lot of luggage you might want to consider other methods of transport."
The lifeline of travellers,It's fast and convenient and the pricing is quite fair too!You can get to almost any destination and you wouldn't need to walk much
Very punctual!,"Very punctual timing. Reliable. If you are lucky, you'd be greeted by curious-english-speaking old folks that might help you in case you got the wrong station"
best Transport,i am visiting seoul for one week and i go everywhere using seoul this train. seoul metro are usefull ad easy to find.
Frustrating,"If you don't have the T-money buzz card which costs 2500 won then you have to pay separately for every journey you do and get a 500 won deposit refund for the card you use every time you finish your journey. This can be done at a special deposit refund machine.Therefore, I highly recommend you get the T-money card. It's worth the 2500 won. The other thing is that the subway isn't as regular as other cities so always allow a little more time than you would normally allocate."
"Easy, Convenient & Cheap!",Easy to use & convenient to use! Only problem is it takes you longer because some stations have shops connected and you get sidetracked.
Clean and quiet,"I love walking around so didn't really take metro that much except one in the morning and one back to hotel. I found walks between 3 station are actually quite short (40mins?) and it's a pity to miss the ""fall sun"" (feels like it) even though it's may already.it's not too packed in general.** Definitely get the citypass instead of single trip/day passes because it's soo much cheaper. The min fare was like 1800won but with the city pass somehow a lot of the rides after the first one of the day were free or like 100won."
Very convenient and clean,"Used the subway to get around Seoul for a full week. Great value, convenient and easy to use even for non-korean speakers."
"Best way to travel in Seoul, so easy to use","The Seoul Metro is so easy to navigate, signage is in English at the stations and the ticket machines have an English selection button. All so easy to use. The stations are clean, the subway platforms are modern and clean and lastly the trains are clean. "
Great way to get too and from Seoul and Inchon International Airport,"I used the Metro a lot, but I must confess I was always with my Korean business colleague and friend.So it seemed very neat and efficient, but then I was being ""carried along"". The trip to the airport is fantastic and there is no need to catch a cab. The trip time was 50 minutes from central Seoul - and way cheaper in price.If i was doing on my own I would have a map and be very clear where I was going and on which line. I think it is the shear number of lines and stations that scared me a bit."
Generally no place to sit and not fast,The Seoul Metro covers almost whole of Seoul. But its generally utter crowded with no place to sit and they run pretty slow compared to your wish.
Simple to use,Having lived in Korea now for a couple of years I find the metro system easy to use. Simple to read and understand with everything in Korean and English.Even with friends visiting they have been able to find their way to my place worth very little trouble. 
"Excellent network, cheap travel everywhere","Quite extensive network, you can reach everywhere easily.Everything is displayed in 4 languages (Korean, English, Chinese and Japanese)."
Fast and cheep ,"The train is fast. The main line, train come every 4 minutes. I love it because it cheep, only USD 1 to 2 every trip. I spend USD 20 for 5 days including from and to international air port. Very convenient using this train."
Excellent ride,"Directions and stations were clearly marked. If in doubt, local people try to help you, don't hesitate to ask for help. language barrier exists, but koreans are helpful."
A great transportation to explore Seoul,The best transportation to move around in Seoul. It's easy and convenient and it connects you to any part of Seoul. It's clean too despite you can see people holding Coffee on hand.
Goto Transportation in Seoul.,You can purchase a T 1 money card and load it in any of the convenience stores within the airport when you arrive. My family and I used the Seoul subway system for our 2 week stay to get around. Very easy to hop on and off. It is crowded but it beats driving in constant traffic! We used the same card for the airport bus service. 
"Easy to,use","The metro is inexpensive and easy to use. If you use a T money card (like an Oyster card in London) you get a small discount and you can top it up at one of the many machines or 7 Eleven shops. If you get stuck, there is always someone there to help. An hour's journey North, cost 1250W. Less than £1"
Metro review,"Metro is well connected and you can use T Money card to swipe in and out. One trouble I had was that its confusing to find the correct platform and will take time to understand. One particular issue was that once I had entered wrong platform and in here minimum money is deducted when you swipe in around 1000won. and after realising that I entered wrongly, I swiped out again 1000 won was deducted. so total 2000 won wasted. In japan there would be station master at each exit and would have asked for direction and also could to balance reset! which was not there in Seoul! "
Awesome,"One of the best in the world. Efficient, cost effective, timely, clean. Great system very well thought out for commuters easy for travelers also "
Airport Train Shuttle to Seoul,"Very Clean and fast train. Very smart staff , with serious respect. I boarded from Airport and headed into city on the express train. You have to move fast otherwise the train will leave you. Impressed with smart uniforms and quietness of the train. Also the attendants were just super"
So fun and nice to meet local people,"Taking the subway in Seoul was one of the funnest thing to do! Loved having sweet random interactions with local people, and seeing old women smile when I gave them my sit :)"
Super easy for English speakers!,"Definitely one of the easier metro systems I've used, and if you have a smartphone you can use the metro app free of charge and offline if not roaming. There's lots to see at every exit so be sure to check out a map, and most stations have an information booth where you can ask whats around the area. "
Good to walk around,Seoul subway is very good. Don't be afraid of the quantite of lines because they are easy to use. The line 2 makes a circle and suround the city. The line 4 has the most famous apots in town. 
Easy to navigate transportation system,First time visiting in Korea - distances between stations are actually not that far but that goes to show how efficient the transportation system is. 
Efficient system,It is an easy system to navigate around and covers large areas of the city. Trains arrived frequently.. The rechargeable tickets were handy and easy to use.
"Civilized, user-friendly and super-convenient","The Metro, and the associated T-money card which enables you to travel by metro, bus or taxi within Seoul, really made to possible to explore the city to the greatest extent possible within the short time we had here. "
Easy to navigate,"The metro is by far the best way to get around Seoul. The subway was very clean and safe. We didn't take our stroller, but many people did. "
Wake up America!,"The US needs to take a cue from Korea! The metro is a smooth running machine. All the buses & trains are clean, well lit & super safe! Which may be due to the fact that CCTV is EVERYWHERE! "
Safest mass transit on Earth?,"Never mind the fact that this is the easiest/most convenient way to commute, when getting around Korea... Let's just take a minute to remove our hats, place them over our hearts, face the flag and pay honor to the all time safest metro system I have ever experienced in my entire life! Never before, anywhere else had I witnessed the following, which I witnessed in Seoul on SEVERAL occasions during my week there: A beautiful young woman, who looked like she could easily have been a super model, sleeping comfortably, totally alone, by herself, with a $12,000 Louis Vuitton bag sitting on her lap. Nobody bothered her. I saw this sort of thing repeat itself time & time again, when riding the metro. In the US, she would have been put through the criminal hat-trick of being raped/robbed/murdered... But not in Korea! Because in Seoul, there are many, many large, tough, thoroughly trained and heavily armed warriors EVERYWHERE, at all times. I never felt so safe in my life! Bravo, Korea!"
Easiest way to get around,"The metro is the best way to get around Seoul, it's clean, reliable and easy to use (ticket machines, station names and platforms etc are in English and Korean so fine if you don't speak the language). Wifi coverage is beyond anything I've encountered anywhere and was free."
Seoul Metro,We were in love with the Seoul Metro upon arriving in Seoul. My sister and I were foreigners and that would be our first time to travel using public transport by ourselves since our elder sister had to go to work. The guide posted on the station and ticket machines were very easy to navigate and we had fun paying and getting refunds! You have to check it out to see what I'm talking about. You will never get lost as long as you read before you get in and exit each train and station. Maps are everywhere and very helpful.
Fun with occasional bad smells,"The Seoul metro is a fabulous innovation of everything Korean. It is easy and fun to understand and of course Koreans love to help you get where you want to go. There is no reason to use any other transportation for distances in the behemoth metropolis that is Seoul, South Korea."
time to accurate,"You can take a metro in time. It is clean station and car. I used T-money. Its very useful. You can get this by convinience store or Infomation. It can recharge. If you want to drink sometiong at auto vender machine, you can use this card. "
The best way to get around,Travelling the metro is cheap and the signs are also in English. You need to purchase a metro card from one of the many convenience stores which you can then top up at any metro station. Be warned though that the main lines are packed with commuters between sunrise and sunset so you may find your face sharing screen time with the commuter standing next to you. The metro is not suitable for strollers.....don't even try. Trains arrive and depart quickly and travel is very safe.
"Friendly for Westerners, Crowds During Rush Hour","I only took one short ride and had a Korean friend with me, but I wouldn't hesitate to use it again on my own. Maps, directions, etc. all seemed to be posted in English. The stops have glass barriers between the platform and the train which alleviates any worries about safety as the train pulls into the station."
"Very clean, functional, and easy to navigate","Before going to Korea, I downloaded KoreaSubway app, and it helped me in both Seoul and Busan.The Seoul subway is nice and clean, and runs regularly with cute little music effects to indicate an approaching train. I did find that the subway train speed is slower than the subway speed in NY or Moscow, but it is a functional and enjoyable method of transportation. There are notification monitors in each subway car that show you what station is coming up and what side of the car the exit would be. "
Easy to use,"Seoul Metro is a great subway system, comparable to the tube. We have used it everyday to get around Seoul. The tickets are easy to purchase directly have the machine and every screen is easy to read and gets you exactly where you want to go. I highly recommend it. "
Beste Metro I´ve ever seen,"Fast, trustworthy, large, really good working. Just beware about line 1 and 2 (2 around Gangnam only) at around 6 pm when people finish work ...!"
Keep a map with you and you can't go wrong,Used a Citipass which made getting around really easy. Can get a refund for unused funds which we did because we had no idea how the fares worked. Stations are well marked and most have english signs so it is hard to get lost but I advise keeping a subway map with you because the stations are large and have many entrances to keep the walking down.
Clean fast and easy,"Clean, easy and efficient way of getting round the City. Ticket machines are in Korean and English and easy to use. Map could be clearer"
Metro,"With traffic so heavy in Seoul, consider taking the Metro! Important to know the following: 1) know the line you need to take, 2) know the direction or end of line destination you need to go towards, 3) know the gate or exit number to leave from and return to (often, there are 4,5,6 or more exits), and keep all of this in mind for your return. The subway is clean, orderly and there is the English version of each stop noted on the screens and on PA system. When buying your ticket, you must enter your final stop for the fare. Keep the ticket for when you arrive, you need it to exit. If you haven't paid enough, you'll have to re-load the difference at the nearby machines. Really, traffic is heavy, the subway is worth it!"
Super easy to get all around the city,"Cheap, clean and fast. Once we got use to it, never took a taxi again even though taxis are very cheap but traffic is really bad. "
Easy to use fast and convenient ,Easy to use even if you dont speak korean.Map looks confusing at first but isnt wluld be more user friendly if the station numbers where on map.
Writing in English,"Seoul metro has writings in English as well as Korean. There are simple directions to lines and to exits (check which exit number you need). There is usually one platform for both directions and the direction of the train is written above the automatic doors/plexi protection from falling on the rail. There is a name of the next station, current station, and previous station. All is billingual. Also in the train the name of the upcoming station and side of the opening doors (left right) is said/written inboth Korean and English.There however are few stations which have separate ticket entrances for different platforms. In such situation you can use the help doors. Press the button and push the doors open and do the same on the help doors on the other/correct side a Korean lady showed me how it works so must be legit). Also if your journey is above 10km extra cash will be taken from your T card (this will be shown when you exit, usually it is 0 but sometimes 100₩)"
Convenient to move around,"If you travel a lot in the mass transit railways, it is better for you to get a T-money card because you don't have to queue up for the single journey ticket and also for the refund of the deposit.But also note that when buying a T-money ticket, it comes in different prices and the ticket price is non-refundable. When you ask for a refund, the convenient store charge you 500 Wons and you cannot sell the card back to them. So better top up with money just enough for your trips.B"
Confusing for inner circle & interconnections,"A quick way to go around but if there is 2 or more of you, the taxi would be a better choice. Crowded during peak hours including weekends. Interconnection can be confusing, esp when you are using the inner circle. Purchasing a ticket is easy as there is english menu. Per trip tickets will earn a refund. Not enough information at the purchasing kiosks to look and confirm the interconnection stations."
"Safe, Easy, Convenient . . . No Excuse NOT to Take It, from Gimpo Int'l Airport","Seoul's metro might appear a bit daunting, but it's a piece of cake. The kiosks for buying tickets are bilingual, with an ENGLISH button that one can push to get all directions in this language. Once on the color- and number-coded train, one will see the station names in both Hangol and English. During off-peak times, the trains aren't that crowded, so one is even likely to find a seat.If flying into Gimpo International Airport, there's really no excuse not to take the metro. It gets one into Downtown Seoul in about a half hour. Don't waste money on a taxi from the airport, as it can easily run between at least 75,000 Won. Instead, take the subway to a big station, and then hop on a cab from there. Just make sure to have the hotel name written in Korean, for ease in communication with the cab driver."
Best way to travel in Seoul,"Anywhere you need to go is accessible from the Metro, and the fares are reasonable, best to get the re loadable card available at all the subway stations. I would 10000 won at a time usually lasted 4-5 days depending on how far you go."
Colour coded & numbered,"Like most Mass Transit systems of developed countries, Seoul has a comprehensive metro network. Unlike their buses which lacks foreign language labeling- meaning it can be chaotic for tourists, Korea's rails are well designed & friendly for visitors who pay attention to Metro's different line numbers, and which are colour coded as well.So spend a little time to study the Metro map, work out nearest stations to/from your destination/hotel, and your travelling experience will be an enjoyable one in Seoul."
Convenient and affordable!,"The Seoul metro is a great way to travel and see all the sites in seoul. Purchase a T-money card and used it to scan in and out of each station, convenient and easy to use. We also used the kpax train from Suwon to Busan and from Busan to Seoul. Nice, fast train. You do have to make sure and research the routes and which train to take. You can easily get on the wrong train if your not careful. There are many trains and routes, it's a very large metro."
Can be confusing,"The metro system in Seoul is a little confusing in terms of the stations listed at each stop. Most metro systems, London and international have colour coded or numbered lines with the end destination being the direction to follow for your desired stop. In Seoul, you start going towards the direction you want, but then when you get to the line or to the next station, the direction becomes confusing as it lists the next few stops on the line as opposed to the final destination of that line. The result is you end up having to go back to the map to see if the new stations listed are still going in the right direction and you're on the right side of the line. It's fine once you get the hang of it hit it can blag your head a bit at first"
Very convenient and easy,"Very easy to use and very difficult to get lost! :) It goes to every corner of Seoul and its satellite cities. You need to buy a special transportation card, like T-money, and use it on any kind of transport in Seoul, even taxis."
"Clean, Modern - Bargain to/from airport","The Metro is a bargain going to/from the airport (4,250 won). I was staying near City Hall and it took about 1:20 minutes to get to Inchon airport. Incomparison, the Airport bus cost 16,000 won.Technically, I took the AREX rail (all stops), can transferred at Seoul station). The trains were clean and came by every 3-5 minutes. The subway cars can get a little crowded during rush hours.Since I was only using the subway for a few trips, I purchased a single journey ticket. When you buy a single journey ticket, you also charges you a 500 won deposit. After selecting your destination, entering money, it provides change and a card. At your destination, look for a refund machine where you enter your card to get back your 500 won deposit.If I was staying longer, I may have been more cost effective to obtain a T Money card or pas."
Clean and easy to transfer.,Seoul has the best Metro/Train systems. Easy to transfer. Clean and safe. All stations are organized by the exits numbers. 
Get anywhere using the longest Metroin the world.,"Signs are in english. I rented a portable wifi and used google maps. This allowed me to not only easily find the right stop, but alos find the right exit to go out of. It is much faster than a cab a lot of times."
Your ticket to Seoul's Soul!,I had this sepanx since our transportation system is way different from Seoul Metro. I had an LSS of the tunes being played in the subway and even found a way to use them as my alarm. I really found this transpo system convenient. 
Convenient but tiresome. ,"Subway is very convenient and cheap - almost any trip within the city costs only 1250 KRW or a little bit over 1US$. Stations and intersections are very broad equipped with toilets and interestingly decorated. Almost all of them connected with shopping malls. Ticket machines are very simple to use. Intervals between trains are from 4 to 6 minutes. It is safe: there are double doors in all stations what prevents falling on rails.Wagons are in good condition, with little exemptions when benches are made with stainless steel couches are soft and relaxing. Information of next station is not pronounced in English but there is a lot of means to inform passenger in English, Japanese and Chinese.But all this quite good impression is spoiled by the fact that subway is quite deep and there are almost no lifts or escalators to the surface (they exists only from platforms to checking poits). To rise by foot every time when you reach your destination is very tiresome, especially for elderly peoples. That is why one should think twice before deciding to use Seoul Metro."
Lack of elevators and escalators ,"Having been doing this for several days with an infant and push chair, I can say that there is a lack of elevators and excel actors (although we shouldn't be using these with a baby stroller, there is not much choice). A lot of the stations leave you no choice other then to carry up and down long flights of stairs, or use the less than safe escalator option. Other than that, metro is clean and safe, runs on time, plenty of shops. "
Comfortable and puncture,Travelled by MRT during my trip. Worries free.Get a T Value card from any convenience stall. The card can be used for airport transfer bus too.
try the trains in Seoul to feel a bit of it..,KOreans are always there to help you if you get lost of your way..You don't have to be scared of.. There is also an english version of the stops/stations.
Cheap and easy to use.,"It nearly takes you everywhere. All indications are also in English, so no problem to move around. Best and fastest way to reach major attractions in Seoul."
Cheap. Quick,Very affordable and you can get anywhere. Make sure you download a subway app for easy navigation. Pay attention to the signs it's easy to get lost underground.
"Subway System in Seoul is Safe, Clean, Affordable, and Easy",The Seoul Metro system is easy to use for English speaking visitors. it is very clean and safe and easy to navigate.
Easy to use,"Since I am used to the NYC and London subways, this one was very simple to navigate. Just be sure to have a subway map to plan out your journey. When I became lost or disorientated in some of the larger stations, there was always some kind English-speaking local that approached me to assist."
"Useful for far off, suburban and peak hour areas","I used a lot of taxi and a little of the metro. Especially to Gimpo Airport for my Jeju flight and that was seamless, short and unexpected, given the comparative overhead traffic.Connects the distant, T money card gets you cheaper trips than cash and has English signage"
Clean and easy to ride,This has to one of the cleanest and safest ways to travel. The subway system in Seoul has wide cars that are always clean. The subway stations are clean and perhaps best of all both audio and written stops are in English. They will announce every stop in both Korean (Hangul) and English. My family lives to use this method of travel. 
Amazing subway system,"I'm originally from NJ, so commuting to NYC was a pain in the butt especially when I have to ride the subway to get to the office. I'm not saying NYC subway system is bad, but it is dirty and crowded. But the Seoul Metro system is a thing of beauty, they are CLEAN and fun. Fun because every station leads you to a world of underground shopping stores! Yes you can easily get lost in a maze like underground pathways, but if you are not in a rush, check out the stores. Oh yes, one more thing, after you get off from the train, within 30 mins, you can hop on any buses for transfer for FREE! I was also told that senior citizens can ride any of their public transportation for FREE, anytime of the day! What a deal! "
Good,"Good to go everywhere and clean but if busy time, will have too many people use it. And quite hard to find the way if you are the travelers. When you want to go somewhere you have to take more time to find the way out or find the transit train."
Great Subway System,"I love using SMRT, I'm saving lots of time and money using it. But it would be great if all stations provides escalator."
Efficient but short of Japan,"With the horrendous traffic you'll encounter, the metro is often the way to go. Cab fares are reasonable but you'll pay while stuck along with the rest of the cabs, while the Metro speeds along underground. The things to be aware of, unlike in Japan, are that they lack easy signage. They're all in English but are never lit and small. Then, prepare to climb the stairs up and down to the platform. Not a problem if you're not weighted-down, but the camera back-pack I carried was like carrying bricks by the end of the day."
"fast, goes everywhere","even if taxis are not expensive, due to the heavy traffic moving by metro is the best solution. could be overcrowded at office hours."
Need To Know to Get Around,"We went to Seoul armed with just the belief that we could do it with Korea Tour and Seoul Subway apps and were able to make it. Their system is straightforward, used hand-in-hand with the app and backed by a lot of web research.Most of the hurdles were during transit from/to KoRail-which I understand is not a part of the Seoul Subway System.All in all it was a typical subway system. I personally found that most of our rides to another station were shorter than the time it takes to walk to the tracks. It's okay to get lost once in a while. You just have to go back to the last station where you boarded. "
Lots of lines but not too confusing,"People complain the metro system is confusing but compared to Tokyo, USA, London, I do not find that bad afterall. There are quite a number of interchanges whick makes in simpler and English signage is widely available. The cons is lack of escalator at some transfer point which makes it rather painful."
Convenient but can be tiring,"It's one of the best methods to travel within the city. With the use of T-card it's even more convenient. Maps in the train are written both in English and Korean language though I found them small. At 8-9 am I found them packed; so avoid those period if possible especially if you're carrying big luggage. It can be tiring when you do transfers as the platforms can be far away - so minimize transfers if you can. Some exits got no escalators and the lifts could be far away. They got toilets in all subway stations, but in all situations I realized that I needed to tap my card to exit to reach to the toilet (and hence the charges). So, go to the toilet before starting your journey. I found Korean very kind that they'd give away their seats for the needy ones - I got kids with me and really appreciated this."
Best way to travel ,Seoul subway is the best way to get around the city. Use the maps and it is the most user friendly subway I have ever used. Make sure to pay attention to the exit number for your destination 
very good network,"Very extensive metro network, high quality service. Everything is also announced in English, so as a tourist you will not have any problems. "
Improvements needed,"I have been to many big cities with metro system. Seoul has probably the 2nd or 3rd most complicated system. The coverage is good and the exits are well placed. However, several things are frustrating:1) the double usage of numbers: there are line numbers and exit numbers, which is confusing;2) inconsistent usage of color on different maps, e.g. One line can be brown on one map, but organize on another map3) English names are too small in the metro map above the train door4) signs in the train station are inconsistent and don't provide sufficient info for foreigners.5) Sometimes I need to tap out to transfer, sometimes not. And I don't know why? E.g. Seoul station.6) it's hard to find staff who understands English and can help."
Best metro on earth,"London, Paris, New York, Tokyo - all great metro systems, but Seoul's is the best, cleanest, safest and easiest to use. It's the best part about living and traveling in this wonderful city!"
"Easy, clean, safe","Definitely worth the price, easy and safe to use. I used the T-money card and travelling was very easy. Just make sure you know which exit you choose, there were up to 14 exits on one station"
Easy to Navigate,"The metro is well connected and easy to navigate. Ask for the English map from the Station Control. I recalled that the stations' names are announced in 4 languages including English. Hence, really makes it easy for non-korean speakers to travel around. Get the T-money card at convenience stores and use it for travel on all public transport. "
on time,on time and very clean. there are stores inside the station where you can buy snack foods. there are screen for information to the passengers and translated to English
Hotel shuttle very convenient and eases travel to various key location.,"As above. Key areas of visit are mainly for shopping - myeongdong, namdemum, dondemum, Other areas of visits like Everland, Lotte World, Palace etc already covered under organised tours in my earlier visits. Covered more areas of visits in Busan"
very good for tourist ,a good metro system where you can find everything very fadt and quick the exits have numbers that make it easier
Great. Easy access for families.,"Easily the most family-friendly metro I've been to. Every station has family restrooms, lifts are everywhere, and generally people are incredibly helpful. We rode this many times with our 2 year old in her stroller during our 5 day stay in Seoul. It really was no problem, as we could always find lifts and escalators. Super cheap and the stops are everywhere!"
Convenient and in-time transportation,"metro is very convenient in city town and can reach to many shopping and tourist places. I like remember the colour of lines to recognise places like this time I lived in the hotel near Jongno Sam-ga station which is on line orange, deep blue and purple. However if you have many luggages with you, it's not easy to find escalators in the exits of some stations. "
Travel the kimchi world. ,"Seoul's metro system are well planned and connected in every direction. Easy to follow directories are placed at convenient locations. The fare are relatively cheap but more expensive than our Hong Kong metro. Like all other subway trains it is very crowded during pick hours. As expected, they have English language on all signage and directories so you won't be lost. It's the most convenient way to go around the city. I would recommend you to buy the T Money card to get a discount on every ride and you can also use it on buses. The card can be bought at convenient stores or train stations. "
Amazing Connections,"The metro is amazing. It transports you everywhere. Some of the rides are long, but you travel great distance. So clean. Very friendly passengers and an easy to use system. A+"
Easy but crowded ,In rush hour they try to push you of the train and some people even walk wit elbow first if you stand in there way.Asking for directions is body language English only if you're lucky.If you use map apps it pretty good to understand 
Extensive Network,"My friend and I used Metro quite intensively for our travel within the city and during our 6 day stay, we found that they have extensive network and that they are very reliable as well as efficient."
Always on time!,This subway is one of the best public transports that I've used! it's very fast and cheaper! it has a dinamic table where we can see the exactly time that the car will be arriving! <3
Great connection,"Easy to understand and use. To help you further, I suggest you download the app ""Korea Subway"". It's very useful."
The best way to get around Seoul,"As far as I'm concerned this metro is one of the best I've ever used. It covers a lot of ground while also being pretty easy to navigate. IMPORTANT though: the Seoul metro is TEN THOUSAND TIMES easier to use if you download a map app on your smartphone. I cannot recommend strongly enough that you do that. Take ten seconds and do it, then enjoy easy travel via the metro. "
Hard to navigate ,"Convenient and cheap to move between places however English signages are very small and hard to understand the system. You'd better remember your station number than name as it could get very confused. Count your stops before get onto the train is the best way. If you exit or enter the wrong line, your ticket will be taken and you could end up needed to buy a new ticket. I was lucky once to find a staff from their office. "
Tourist Friendly,"You won't get lost as long as you know how to read English.:) There are Chinese and Japanese translations also. It is very accessible and mostly located near the tourist area. In my opinion, it is better than the HK MTR. "
Understanding Seoul Metro,"Due to language problem, taking Seoul metro can be daunting at first. Most sign boards are in Korean. Interstingly, all metro station has a number . E.g. Hak-dong station is number 731 . i.e. line 7 , station 31 . In this way, it is easy even if do not understand Korean. However, there are many exits in most stations and some underground stations are really big ( with malls even ) . Hence, important to figure out the exit you should take."
One of the most clean & efficient Metro Systems in the world!,"No graffiti anywhere. Clean subway cars. They even smell nice!We loved traveling on the Seoul Metro. Be sure to get an ""M-Pass"" or ""T-Money"" card.Happy Travels!"
The cleanest Subway I have ever seen,"We took the subway to the fish market and was really impressed. The underground is full of shops and no graffiti (like in subways in the US,)"
Excellent public transportation!,"I'll admit, I have a slight obsession with public transit, having grown up in a very small town. That being said, the Seoul Metro is one of the cleanest, safest, and most easily navigated transportation systems I've ever used. "
"Extensive, but quite intuitive","After years of living in Hong Kong and navigating its convenient and friendly MTR system, Seoul's by contrast looks overwhelming at first glance. Fear not...if you spend a couple minutes reading their Metro maps, it is not as daunting as it seems. Use it, it beats the wide traffic-filled streets! "
Metro,Excellent and easy. Clean and safe. You can easily get a metro card because you can change the card supplier in different languages. 
Love the metro system in Seoul,"I love the convenient, clean, and easy system of Seoul metro. If you are from a metropolitan city and used to metro system like this, you will also find it easy to ride."
More than a transportation,"Metro is easy to learn for tourist and stations are also written in english. Conveniently located in most of the city and as a tourist if you lost your way, just walk around and look for a metro station, as all metro lines are connect to each other."
Easy and clean Public Transport,"Super Easy and Clean. You can go anywhere in minutes. But if you travelling with baby stroller or wheelchair, in some stations there is no elevator access (or maybe we missed that) so that you have to fold the stroller/wheelchair and go through escalator. "
Fantastic system!,"The Metro in Washington DC is far, far behind as far as promptness, safety, and overall cleanliness."
Great,One of the best metro that i ever traveled considering the extension and quantity of lines. First day a little bit complicated but after a while will be easy. And if you have a app for the phone it's really great. Even the calculation of the times because i never notice aome delay
Best subway in the world.,"Best way to get from point A to B in Seoul. It's clean. It works. Best subway in the world. Safe, Easy. Efficient. Affordable. Just Go."
Comfortable Journey,Convenient to purchase tickets by cash. On weekend is crowd limited so more comfortable for tourists.
All about metro station,I think subway at korea very efficient..very fast one and have many line that link to many district.. I love it
So Easy,"Coming from Melbourne, Australia, where our system is just nuts, this is breath of fresh air. The best feature I found was being able to buy a single trip ticket, then get a refund on the deposit of the cardTrains frequently run all day & into the night"
Seoul Searching,"The Seoul Metro goes everywhere. It is possible to buy an underground pass at many stores, such as SevenEleven and GS25. Amounts can be added to the card as needed. The card can be taken to these stores and the rest of the amount is refunded. The cost of the card is 300 won. We left the card in the plastic container so that it could be reused."
Efficient and very modern metro,Metro cheap way to go around Seoul.Buy the T money card to save up on fares.Ticket machines in every station with English instructions.subway maps on English too.Elevators and escalators for easy access too.
다른나라보다 정말 환승시스템짱,환승시스템은 세계최고인것같아요. 깨끗하고..Transportation system is really good in seoul. You can transfer to bus from subway
"Clean, fast and cheap","Kiosks have English language screen, easy to use. Trains run frequently and are very clean. Well thought out navigation aids such as maps in Latin as well as Korean alphabet, clearly marked neighborhood maps guide travelers to the correct exit."
East travel,Very easy and convenient to travel around seoul. Easy way is to buy a T - card and top it up for usage. 
It's a subway.,Seoul has very good and reliable public transportation. By doing a little research you can take the subway most anywhere. All the stops have English and Korean signs. Just pay attention to the signs inside the cars. Some of them were not working and it was beneficial for us to keep our subway map handy and count the stops.
"Easy, inexpensive","If you buy a T money card is really easy to use. You add as much as you want. Buses included, as well as many other services "
Best Subway system around!,"I LIVE in Seoul; have for 20 years. I have travelled around the World extensively and, In a nutshell, the subway/Metro here is the absolute best.Other Metro systems might be more artistically-adorned, or have their own positive attributes, but for sheer overall convenience the Seoul Metro has to be the best. Reasons? (i)The most kilometres of track of any Metro (c. 450); (ii) Super cheap - basic single zone fare over 7kms is $1; (iii) extremely clean cars and stations; (iv) amazingly extensive - 19 lines now (there were 4 when I arrived in 1996), and projected to have 27 lines by the mid 2020's; (v) multi language service/announcements; (vi) free wifi and cyber-service on all trains/stations (vii) superb frequency - 1-2 mins during 'rush hours', <5 mins most other times; (viii) very convenient locations and ease of transfer to the Korail (National Rail) system; and (ix) High speed express and semi express trains from/to Seoul and Incheon International Airport!If you live in Seoul, or even visit, you don't need a car at all!"
Excelent way to move a round the city,Very nice network and working stations. Information personnel are very helpfully and helps you to get right location and right ticket. We had T-card which works for many different public transportation vehicles even bicycles.
Excellent quality and efficiency,"You have to buy a POP card which costs around 2,500 won from any corner shop like 7/11 and then you load it in machine underground. You scan the card going in and out and it debits it of the right amount. The metro is clean, frequent and spacious. there are not so many maps of the whole network around so best to pick up a map if found in tourist centres."
Best subway network in the world,"Easy, accessible, great running times, regular, clean, English signage, safe, modern... Impossible to get lost. Seoul has the best subway system in the world. Traveling all over the city is a piece of ""low fat"" cake.. Very economical. Traveling to the airport is simple too. Worried whether you can manage your way around the city?need not!!! I hope you all enjoy yourself as much as I did using the public transport system. "
Seoul adventure,It was easy to get around but a lot of lines. You need to make sure you have a map or google your destination. 
VERY VERY IMPRESSIVE,Its massive...its huge...its new...clean and easy to use...i highly recommend it to be the best way for moving around seoul..the stations are neat and clean...everyone is busy with their smartphones....and it can take you anywhere...loved the experience
The future of transportation,"Best subway ever! Loved the arrangement of lines, the schedule is awesome, suitable for first-time visitors, safety level = tip top. Even children can access to it easily. Tourist-friendly as the guidelines, schedule and announcements are conveyed in three languages. Korean, English and Japanese."
Efficient,Koreans commute a lot so their public transportation is heavily used. The metro system is crowded but I found it to be very efficient and easy to get around. A lot of the destination signs are in English but I learned how to read Hangul and got my own map of the rails to get where I wanted from anywhere.
Surprised with the service,Such an efficient system and use of space with markets in the subway stations. Trains were also practically always on time and ready to pick up passengers. No long wait times like in other cities. Used this subway more than taxi service.
Modern Seoul with modern transport,"Seoul Metro map seems to be a web on my first contact. Sometimes I found it difficult for transfer. The number plates puzzled me at first because I could not distinguish the line number and the exit number on the first two days. However, after that it looks much easier. The only problem left about transfer should be the lines run by other company such as Korail!"
Convenient,"the public transportation system in Seoul is superb, it will take you to all the destinations conveniently. The stations are so huge though that you have to walk and walk and climb some stairs .. but overall, it did help us take us to our destinations."
"Fast, efficient, and clean","When traveling abroad, the quality of a country's public transportation system says a lot about its development. Korea, and Seoul specifically, is second to few. Easy to understand in any lingua Franca, the metro is fast, efficient and clean. It's underground platforms are littered with shopping opportunities some would normally have to find in a mall. Its ticket dispensing machines are easy to understand and navigate. Its metro police are helpful and polite.While taxis are affordable and require less effort, I highly recommend the metro for its efficiency and cost."
Excellen,"Excellent metro, cheap, clean, WiFi, vending ticket machines with English language option, helpful staff and volunteers "
One of the most developed,"It is one of the most developed and well organized subway system in Asia. If u have visited Hong Kong, Taipei or even Singapore, u shouldn't have any problem travel in Seoul by using the subway system. It is a standard system with clear sign board in korea language and English. Thus visiting Seoul is never been easier than this. "
Good and efficient,"Well. I don't have anything to compare it to really since this is my very first subway experience. I ride city buses in Korea and hate it. so cramped and people crowded unsafely in buses far beyond capacity. Subway also lets an unchecked number of ppl on board. Not sure if that's normal or not but I imagine it's not safe to allow any untold number of passengers to squeeze into the train. Still the train in comfortable and clean. It is also quiet and there are elevators to use as needed. Now pregnant, I was really happy about the ease of finding elevators to avoid those long flights of stairs."
"Good, clean, safe",Only complaint really was about some of the lines and connections meant that getting from A to B was not so direct as it would have seemed on a map. A big plus for the clean toilets that were on many stations! That was totally unexpected.
Cheap way to get around Seoul....,"I took the metro a few times to get around the city. It was fairly cheap but there are many different subway lines, so it can get confusing. I was always able to find someone in the stations to help me find my destination on the subway map to buy my tickets for one-way rides. I just paid as I went, but there are different tourist or day passes available. AT times there was quite a bit of walking when I had to transfer lines and this involved going up and down lots of stairs or escalators. There were elevators but hard to find, so if you tire easily from walking, you might find taxis a better option. "
"Express train from the airport to Central Seoul rail station, then a taxi to your hotel","I had the chance of being met at ICN airport my my hosts but declined because I'd read positive reviews of the express train from the ICN airport to central Seoul rail station. Everything suggested that it is quicker than a car, cheap, clean and totally reliable. And, all those aspirations turned out to be true. For eight or nine US dollars equivalent you can be delivered to Seoul central station in 53 minutes (it is possible to save a couple of dollars by using a stopping-train that will add 20 minutes to the journey). The Express Airport Train has comfortable reserved seats, special racks for your luggage, and signage that makes it clear where you are at all times. I can't imagine a better way of traveling to downtown Seoul. At the train station there are sufficient number of taxis all of which work on meters that clearly indicate the price. No tipping is required or expected. There is no additional charge for baggage, no scams and no offers to take you to a ""store owned by the driver's cousin."" Taxis are more reliable in Seoul than in any other Asian city in which I've traveled. If you combine the Express Airport Train with the taxi you can be a anywhere in Seoul city, resting in your hotel, for under $20 US inside of an 90-mins from leaving ICN."
Very efficient! Download the Subway app. ,"I think one of the best mass transportation in the world. Very efficient. Signs are very helpful and you will never get lost. It's almost connected to most of the tourist attractions like Dongdaemun Design Plaza, Cheonggyecheon Stream, Myeongdong Street, Lotte Mart, etc. I recommend though as a first timer to download the app : Subway. It was super duper helpful for me while I traveled with my 6 year old son and my 63 year old mother. I led the way all the time and this has helped me navigate the Seoul Metro very easily. Very convenient to purchase and load money on your T MONEY card in convenience stores or in the airport before traveling. "
Truly efficient,"What else can I say? The metro is very efficient - and I mean very - with up to the minute time of arrival. Super convenient to get to anywhere with the metro. Well, generally the public transport in Seoul is amazing and efficient. I especially am amused by the sound of a trumpet playing at the station right before the train arrives. :D"
Comprehensive and economical,Easy to use once you get the hang of it. We did get lost the first time though. Economical if used with a T Money which can be bought from convenience stores and vending machines in the stations. Remaining amount may be refunded for a small fee in some convenience stores.
Better than cars,I didn't even use a taxi. The metro takes you anywhere and is very cheap! Now I understand why South Koreans use it. Is very convenient.
On time,"Very accurate times, hardly ever late. English signs everywhere and colour coordinated. Very similar to the ones you will find in Japan. The Japanese train seats were more comfortable though and quieter, not sure about the rules in Korea but in Japan everyone was very quiet and it was frowned upon to talk on the phone, doesn't seem to be the case over here. "
"Easy, clear",The Seoul metro is as easy/clean as any I've seen in the world. Cost for a single fare ticket is about $1 USD. It can get crowded (of course) and Koreans aren't the most personable on public transportation (but who is).
"Quite straightforward, safe and efficient","Used it to travel around the city, with good signage in English. Trains are very spacious and air conditioned, with typical fare being 1350 Won for a single journey. You do need a pre-loadable card (which has a 500 Won refundable fee), can be a bit temperamental, but if you can't get it to reload, just refund it in one of the adjacent machines and start again. It's a big system, so journeys can be lengthy, but a great way to avoid the inevitable downtown traffic jams"
One of the best subway,"Seoul metro really is one of the best subway. Fast, lots of station, lots of subway lines, ultimately safe with the existance of the platform screen and very easy for foreigners to use even for those who don't understand korean. Definitely an envy of the world."
Seoul metro,The Seoul mertro is very easy to access. You can change any different line （colour) without worry. You just need to use the T-meony card.
Easy to use,"Comfortable, easy to use and ride, and cheap. Very good way to get around the city. Didn't get lost once."
Fantastic transportation system,I use the Metro App and I find it incredibly helpful. I've been also impressed by the sculptures game design of all the different metro stops! It's always an exciting Adventure.
Take me there,Seoul Subway system is an amazing spider cob web of tracks that pretty much take you to every crevice and corner of Seoul with pace and efficiency. Absolutely loved it.
Easy to navigate and plenty of English signage,"Easy to navigate and plenty of English signage - we did stuff up one trip where we took the wrong line/direction, but on the whole the system is great. It is clean, trains come every few minutes and on nearly every train we caught there were announcements visually and over audio of which station was coming up next and where it connects to."
Seoul subway is the best!,I took the metro lines frequently when I travelled in Seoul. Subway is convenient and are busy with local travellers. Travelled with convenience within the subway lines. Easy to go to places of interest within minutes.
Easy to use,"Easy, efficient and reasonable prices to get around Seoul area. Especially in busy hours when traffic stacked!"
"Safe, fast and easy","Don't hesitate to use public transportation in Seoul. Very easy to understand, efficient and extremely safe. One of the easiest systems around."
"Fast, clean, efficient","But also a huge network and therefore a bit confusing at first. Station numbering helps a lot. Sometimes long, Paris-like corridors at interchange stations. Get a T-money card from any convenience store, will save you money in the long run."
Seoul subway,"Before going to Seoul, friends told me that the subway lines in Seoul is confusing and it is hard to understand as it is all written in Seoul language. This is not so true after we explore the subway lines. It is very convenient as they have English translations on the name of the station as well. If you been to Singapore and know how to use their MRT, then you will be able to use Seoul Subway. The only different is you are allowed to eat and drink -- we saw the local doing it but with much discipline and cleanliness is well reserved."
Just perfect,"I love seoul metro so much. It is so easy to get anywhere in seoul (yes anywhere). I love how their tourist guide also provide the metro map, and the details stops for each attractions.I was travelling by self and never get lost once i understand the metro map. The only hassle is sometimes we have to walk quite far to change the lanes. However, it is safe even at night. I travelled 10 pm and still feel safe. If you dont speak korean, pay attention to the notice board of the next stop or counting how many stops you need till your stop.I also love the shops they have in metro stations, sometime you can get good cheap things."
Very easy to use. English language available,"Best mode of transport getting around. Get a stored value card and if you fall short on value, there are fare adjustments kiosks just at the turnstiles which you could use to top up the card."
Metro,Very clean and safe metro system. The system is easy to navigate and the stations are conveniently located. It never seems as though you are far from a station at any time from any point in the city. There is an app that we found useful for navigation.
Easy to navigate,"I stayed at the JW Marriott and the express terminal is connected to it. Some us in English but the colors and numbers helped make it easy. Low cost to ride, can get you almost anywhere in Seoul"
Thundering Silence,Best Metro ride whole world. Was caught in the morning rush and jammed pack like sardine. The ride was the quietest I ever had. Nobody spoke on their phone and handphone games was played with the headset. only sound was that of the rolling stock..
"Over all, it was a fantastic tour i had.",Korean Subway is really cool and people are friendly. Easy to locate and fastest way to reach my destination. I can save a lot rather riding a cab.
Convenient and hassle free,"Convenient and hassle free way to move arnd the city, avoiding horrid traffic congestions. Interlinked underground walkways with many small shops selling a variety of things from shoes, wigs, dresses, music stores and opticians! "
Efficient and Reasonably priced,"Fast, clean and efficient. Minimum journey starts from 1250 KRW. Very comfortable and gets you almost everywhere in Seoul."
"Reliable, Valuable way of travel","On-time, valuable for money, convenient. Seoul metro network is so extensive and comprehensible for tourist"
Best in the world,"Seoul's transportation system is the best in the world bar none. Good apps for subway and bus lines, which not surprisingly run on time"
Using The metro map to move around in Seoul,Reading the metro map of Seoul is an easy way to move around in this grand metropolis. Station-exits are numberedto identify the direction that you want to proceed to get to your target destination. Clarity is great.
"One of my favourite things about Seoul, but not elderly-friendly","This may sound weird but I really did enjoy my trips around Seoul on the train. It is pretty fast, convenient and clean. Wait times sometimes can be a little long (comparatively to my own country) but it’s all usually really efficient. We have an equally efficient metro system back in my own country but I just loved how I could get to literally anywhere in Seoul via the train. Transfers to different lines are possible at almost every other station. Also again, this may sound weird but each train station had a multitude of exits, which meant it was possibly only a short walk to wherever you are headed to. A small point, but I found it really convenient. Another thing I really enjoyed was the night view whenever I was on the train that had to go from the Northern part of Seoul to the South and vice versa. Just an amazing night view of the Hangang area. However, there is alot of walking that one needs to do - be it to transfer to another line, locate the exit you need to get out of etc. Also lots of climbing of stairs, and as I was travelling with elderly people, it gets very tiring for them and can be really inconvenient."
Good Transport system,Good system.Cheap and fast way to travel in SeoulFrequency of metro is good.Clean and Air conditioned travel.
Easy to travel around with the Metro,"Just go to the convenience stores (StoryWay) and buy the Tmoney card. Then load it up there with say 10K won and you're good to go. Just tap and go through the gates. Their Metro is easy but there are some gotchas, for instance some lines will fork and you need to be sure you're on the correct forked line.Very easy and great!"
Very easy to navigate around the city with.,All you need is about 30 minutes to study where you want to go and jump on the train and enjoy. Don't forget to get your ticket refund of 500 Won when you arrive at your destination
"Fast, cheap, and clean!","Unlike some American and European subway systems, the Seoul subway is very clean and organized, which immediately made me like it! It can be difficult to overcome the language barrier; I would recommend obtaining a map first thing of the whole city with each stop. Review it with your hotel concierge or study it a little yourself so it makes more sense when you arrive to a stop.Most stops have multiple exits depending on what side of the street you need. It is common to meet friends at a specific exit of a station.Koreans, and other foreigners, are wonderfully helpful if you cannot figure out where you're going!"
Efficient and cheap,"Nothing to complain about, as long as you're ready for many steps (and escalators) and the crowd of course! It's fast, cheap, reliable, ultra clean, and efficient. I wish European metros were like that. (The price to pay for this are the constant reminders and message about what to and not to do.... I guess that if I were understanding Korean I really would feel like a baby learning to behave all the time, but as I don't....)"
Easy to get around,Buy a T card and your on your way. You must not be afraid to walk a few blocks.Rush hours very crowded. Very easy to use with even if you do not read Korean.They did a good job planning the routes---
Easy to follow,"Definitely get a T-money card once you arrive in Seoul and try to take the train as it's super easy and cheap! They display the station you are currently in and the previous station (on the left) and the next station (on the right with an arrow) right above the door as you wait for the train. They also announce the stop in Korean and English. Trains are very clean, fast and comfortable. I didn't smell anything when we were riding on the train. "
Seoul Metro,Best way of getting around Seoul and easy enough to master - all stations are announced in English as well as Korean. 
Very efficient and convenient,"The subway is efficient and very clean. However, walking long distance is required especially when changing lines. The fare is affordable (depend on your country's currency) as charged according to distance. However, it can be confusing too as there are lots of lines and exits."
Very efficient means of transportation,"With 9 city routes plus 6 other routes it covers basically every corner of Seoul and provides efficient links to adjacent areas. Fare is cheap which would cost around 1 USD per trip in the city, and slightly more for outskirts. Two airport express lines linking Inchon and Kimpo airport to the downtown Seoul station. One must take note that one of the two express lines would stop at all stations from Inchon to Seoul station, while the other one would not.Buy a T-money stored value and rechargeable card from any convenient store would make you urban trips much easier as it can be used for train, metro, bus and taxi. Metro system is quite reliable and well managed, with clean station and cabin environment, notice boards with good visibility, announcement in English as well. With a copy of the city map and mobile phone app, one would find it quite pleasant touring the city by metro."
Seoul Searching,"A bit confusing at first, hey we only have 2 lines at home, but once you get a hang of it it's a breeze going around the different attractions in Seoul. The downside is they have few escalators, which is somewhat good to keep you warm and fit."
Convenient + Inexpensive,"Tourist destinations are accessible via the metro in Seoul. The ticket machines were easy to use, the stops on the train would be announced in Korean, Japanese, Mandarin, and English. There are underground passageways that you can walk through after exiting train in the station, with signage specific to where it leads to, easy to navigate and convenient. "
Efficient metro system,"The Seoul metro is efficient and clean. However, owing to the fact that there are 9 lines criss-crossing all over Seoul, the subway map makes for difficult reading. For greater convenience, do buy a T-Money card from any convenience store (there are plenty all around Seoul). It's the equivalent of London's Oyster Card, Singapore's Ez-Link Card and Hong Kong's Octopus Card.Trips generally start from KRW 1,250. Also, do your research beforehand to confirm which subway exit is closest to your destination. Each subway station typically has at least 6 exits; some of which can be several minutes apart on foot so you won't want to come out of the wrong exit!"
Walk so long every stop,Seoul metro have to walk for so long to change the line and It's not convenient for handicap or old people at all!!! I took the train here made me miss the train in Singapore and Japan a lot! The Seoul MRT is so complicated.
convenient to most tourist spot,"convenient access to most tourist spot, but some transfer of lines need to walk quite a bit without elevator"
Extremely accessible!,"Metro timing was superbly on time. Facilities at Seoul station had English instructions, so everything was easy to access! Station had ample seating for commuters to wait."
Perfect transportation for foreigners,"Everything is well planned in metro. Metro linked with mobile app. All about stations and train timetable, transit information will be available in app. Easy to reach from one place to other. Timings are perfect. It is connected to almost all tourist spots and some shopping malls. We can find many shopping mall on top of metro stations."
As Good As Any Metro In The World,Very user friendly. Almost impossible to get lost. Easy to buy your ticket from the machines and get your deposit back. Fairly priced for any destination.
"plan ahead, know your bearings","cheapest, fastest, easiest way to get around in Seoul. like all metros in big cities, plan ahead, decide where you want to go, decide which EXIT to get out of the station to your destination.--an exercise in logistics!you can get to anywhere within reach of the metro, within the city, there are many shopping underground between stations, quite easy to forget your bearings with endless temptations in all directions.You can get the T-money card which can be used on taxis, buses, some shops and of course the metro, the only catch is there is no refund for money unused in the card when you finally say goodbye to Seoul.Easy to buy single journey tickets at the ticket machines, there is a deposit of 500Won which is refundable in some machines at some stations. or get a refund from a friendly station uniformed staff"
Convenient and cost savings to move around in Seoul!,The metro station is truly easy to get around as they have English words and announcement inside the train for every station. Their officer at the train station are fairly helpful too though sometimes they're not too good in English speaking.
Make sure you know where you are going !,"Seoul Metro network is big and complicated, and some interchange is confusing. Some stations without lifts, you need to drag your baggage up to street level by staircase."
convenient and fast,"A big city needs a big, reliable subway system and that's what this is. All station names are written out for English speakers, too. Particulary helpful are the numbered exits, which make it very easy to find your way out at the right end. "
Easy ,The metro in Seoul was easy to use. There are even occasionally people at the ticket machines to help with getting tickets. 
Korea Tourism,It was amazing and fast clean and there was a back In Line 1 and Line 2 years ago I had a middle guide the heck I do not want to see the map transfers umjikyeodo now would have been better is considered a comfortable consensusᆞ
Reasonably easy to follow the directions but..,"The stations are clean and well marked. Not all stations have lifts or escalators so dragging your luggage around will be tiring. Reasonably easy to follow the directions but beware of different train serving the same line. There is the ITX trains and the normal subway serving the same stations and you have to listen or look at the signs before boarding the train. If you are taking ITX train at Yongsan or other stations, you can enter the station through a special gate which dont require you to pay with the T Money card. But if you are taking the metro to other stations after your ITX train, you have to tap your T Money card the the station you are in so that when you exit the destination station you can tap the T Money card."
Easy to use,Surprisingly allot easier to get around vs the Japan trains. Signs in English also. Download the subway map to help you.
Great way to move around Seoul,"Easy access to go round and about in Seoul, a lot of stairs but elevators are available in most (if not, all) stations. Buy the T-money card for a good transportation investment in Seoul because it can also be used for bus and taxis."
Fast and efficient.,They have subway trains almost everywhere for mode of transportation. Really convenient to get from a place to another.
Visit downtown Seoul City,"Very convenient, easy access to everywhere and very economical compared with taxi fare. No traffic jams and connect to all the popular tourist resorts and shopping centres."
The best one,It doesn't matter how many stranger in there.Even it's much expensive than before...Yeah I'll miss it!
Great system,"You can take buses, subway and trains all with one easy to buy and use card. It begins with picking up the train at the airport to get into Seoul. All the buses, subways and trains are clean and run on schedule."
Too many stairs,Can't go back to catch the train of opposite direction at old lines. Some old stations does not have escalator to street level.
Easy and Efficient way to get around,"If you have any experience with big city metro systems, you should find this one a breeze. The ticket machines have an English option and take you thru the process of getting your ticket very simply. Destination stations are listed alphabetically. Fares are generally very reasonable. The trains get crowded at peak hours but this is the case in any big city. Overall, everything is clean and smooth running. An added bonus is the underground shopping malls you get an many of the big stations. At the end of the journey, if you bought a single journey ticket, you should redeem your deposit of 500 Won from the redemption machines as you exit the barrier. I only used single journey tickets but I understand stored value cards are available as well."
Fast and not Expensive,"Comparing to MRT in other big cities, Seoul Metro is maybe the cheapest. Each way costs 1350 Won or 1250 with T-cash card.Avoid rush hours, but the metro stations has some disadvantages: there are some exits which has no lifts and no elevators. It won't be easy if you bring heavy luggage. "
Widely connected,Seoul metro system is well connected. Almost all part of Seoul is connected by metro. However be prepare to walk stairs since some metro station still do not have lift facilities. There are escalators but I find the speed of the escalators is a tad bit slow. Overall this is your transport of choice in seoul.
Clean and efficient,"What more is there to say? You can get just about anywhere on the subway. It is cheap, reliable, and clean. The cheap part can't be overstated. It costs between $1 and $1.50 to get anywhere!!Random side note: all of the stations have lockers for emergencies that have gas masks. They really are all about emergency preparedness here!"
Line number 9 is crowded,Pretty easy to navigate this system with the ability to purchase tickets based on your final destination. Ticket kiosks are in several languages as well. Only problem was it seemed we paid for a fare that had to connect through at least two separate lines and on the third we had to buy the final leg of the trip over for some reason.Careful of the number 9 line around rush hour as it gets really packed and hot.
the most convenient way to go around Seoul,Just go to 7-11 or other convenient store which selling T-Money Card which you could take it to go around Seoul by subway and buses by only ONE card.
Lines will take safely to your desired destination in Seoul,THE public transportation you must consider for both residents and tourists.My foreign friends to the city are usually very impressed by its convenience and accuracy.
Tricky,First to buy a ticket or T money u will need cash.I dont know how they charge u .first trip i was charged for 3500wan in my way back paid only 1400wanNeeds caution
Very convenient,Good with Eng and Chi signage and clear route color. Easy to reach every where. Remember to get the deposit refund of the ticket. Return the ticket with the machine at each station and you will get the refund.
Almost reached to everywhere of Seoul,"You could go anywhere by Metro. They have many difference line to the central, countryside and airport of Seoul. Just it should define difference zone with cheaper fare. Because only one station to cost for 1,350 won. Its quite expensive for visitor"
Perfect ,"Having spent a lot of time in London, I am more than familiar with the metro, and although London is the oldest in the world, it's not the best!Seoul metro is specious, clean and reliable (from the 5 days I had to use it)Advice: make sure you get a mobile hot spot which can be picked up from the airport, there are plenty of operators, which are really affordable, and you will have WiFi with you on the go l, as well as downloading a Seoul metro app (I used the mapway app as it comes with route planner etc.)You will save so much time and effort in getting around."
awesomely convenient !!!!,travelling by metro is economical.. take a metro card ..so u don't have to buy tickets again and again.. available at all major departmental stores..
Easy to use,Very easy to navigate all of seoul with their well organised metro system. They have an incredible number of stops and all exits are labeled with numbers so it's easy to meet up with friends.
Easy to use,We went to the Fish Market using the Metro and it was pretty easy to use. The signs are straightforward and the trains are clean and fast.
Easy,"Easy an predictable. Fare rates. Clean. I experienced the lcal guests as very respectfull and easy, also during rush-hours."
Cheap and very easy to use,"Buy a T money card from the machine and swipe like an Oyster card. Subway is very convenient and very easy to understand, I love the t under they play when a train is coming!"
Great way to get around the city. ,"Once you've picked up a T Card (available from stations, 7/11 G25) you are away. The trains are efficient, clean, spacious and the whole network is easy to navigate. It is a very cheap way to travel with single journeys costing as little as 100 won. Your T Card can also be used to pay in taxis and on the bus."
"Clean, Safe and Fast",Armed with a tourist map of the subway system I was able to get around the city with ease and always find just where I wanted to be. It's an impressive public system in which I always felt very safe and a few times when I was studying the map people would offer help. Good experience.
Travel,Excellent source of travel! Pretty simple to maneuver. Be careful travelling with luggage; the turnstiles ocassionally capture the luggage being pushed through and then you get stuck.
Easy too use if you have an app,We were complete baffled when we got here Google is really no help as they don't use there mapping here but once you have got the hang of it its the only way to get around taxis and the traffic here don't mix.I went to the Google play store and searched seoul subway and it was the best app
A lot of people and English station name come very shortly.,"A lot of people and English station name come very shortly.Some subway line has English Station name when it arrived, some subway line come very shortly just 3 sec.It will be better to have more information which station is we are arrived."
"Signage, directions and audio instructions all in English.","Easy to use. If you can do London or France, you will find Seoul even more user friendly. Also a bargain."
Easy to navigate ,First day in Seoul and I decided to venture out on my own. Instead of a taxi I used the metro. Very easy to understand and they were pretty clean. The price was reasonable as well. This is the mode of transportation I will be using this week.
"Clean, on time, just perfect!","One of the best subway system I have ever used. Very clean, good connections, all the info are available in English. Love how the exits were numbered and signed."
Slow but sure ride on the Seoul metrxi,"Seoul metro is everywhere and comfortable to ride.It is slower than other metro system like Tokyo or Moscow, but safe and convenient to ride.THe cabin is new and you can find the station easy by English words and station colors."
"Confusing at first, but so easy to use","There are so many lines....and looking at the metro map can be dizzying at first, but once you get used to the system, it's the best mode of transportation in Seoul. It comes on time everytime, and you know exactly where you're going and how long it'll take. All the subway carts are relatively clean. If it's your first time visiting Seoul, subway is the way to go. "
So easy and fast,"Even it ourselves a T money card and loaded in 20,000 won. We used it everyday and it was super convenient and simple,"
I can't believe I am reviewing this!,"Believe it or not this is one of the attractions of Seoul. The system is extensive and the easiest to navigate of any system I have encountered anywhere, even for a foreigner. The trains are frequent, clean and comfortable. And I loved the way they play snippets of music (like Vivaldi) as the train is approaching. Definitely try it out."
snakes underground to every part of Seoul,Used this to get around efficiently but not for people who can't walk well. Think I walked 100 miles. Shopping underground too. Traffic is gridlocked above ground so have to use during rush hour. Lots of stairs so beware if you aren't in good shape.
Great metro system ,"Very reliable, timely and worth catching!!Clean, efficient but packed. On time!! Easy to use once you get the hang of it. "
KTX Rocks!,Traveling by KTX is so efficient and comfortable! They have snack carts and free wifi - the best way to travel Korea. 
Convenient sand Affordable,"I love Seoul's subway system. It's amazing! The metro is a great for getting around Seoul (and Korea in general) especially during congested road traffic hours. It is very affordable compared to other cities metro lines coming in at about $1.50 per ride (distance depending). Furthermore, for travelers and foreigners there are many in depth subway apps that delve into train's arrival and departure, fastest transfer, least amount of transfer, multiple languages, etc. "
simple and wide reach metro system,"As my experience through Europe, HK, Singapore, Malaysia and Japan, i found out that korea has the most simple and wide-reach metro system than other country. The station was convenient, there were toilet at almost all station and the information about interchange will not confuse u. The fare was quite cheap base. The single trip ticket was based on destinations while all destination ticket used flat rate on any destination. The payment can be done by cash or by T-money. If u used T-money, there is a discount for your ticket. You can buy T-money at the airport and top up the balance at any convenience store that has T-money logo. If you are a tourist and used metro frequently, you should consider taking M-pass tourist pass. it is available on the arrival terminal on Incheon Airport at Tourist Information counter. There are 1 and 3 day pass. I personally was taking 3 day pass for 25.000 won. The pass can be used as T-money. it covered almost all metro line except GJ line and you can used it for 20 metro rides per day for free for 3 consecutive days. It is quite useful if u used at least 11 metro rides per day. interchanges at stations are free. It also covers the airport express train all stop (9 stops to seoul station), but not airport express direct train. When you have finished used it, you can have a refund of 4.500 won deposit and the remaining balance (if u topped it up, and the balance hasnt gone zero) at the airport (Tourist Information counter at arrival terminal). "
Seoul metro,"The metro in Seoul is reasonably priced and incredibly easy to use. Purchase a ticket from a kiosk and off you go. The ticket includes a 500 wan deposit, but you can get the deposit easily back by putting the plastic card in a kiosk as you leave the metro. Fares start from just a little over $1 per trip. Maps are easy to read and follow."
Metro @ Seoul is easy to go & cheap,"It will be a very good idea to visit Seoul with Metro as it covers the major tourist interest and very user friendly. Especially using a T- money card, will make the trip road less travel!"
A stone's throw to all attractions and shopping,Very convenient to all attractions and shopping. There are restrooms and shops in the subways if you're feeling peckish or whatnot. A great way to commute in Seoul.
the best option for city touring,"the map is easy to understand, with good planning you can visit many places with less time, cost and effort than using a bus. but at some station the exit is quite far (compare with metro station in singapore or tokyo)"
Metro,"Clean, modern , signs in English. Lots of shops. Easy to negotiate. There are lots of stairs though into the station to walk up. "
Great lines,City has great metro lines - cheap and available everywhere. Good conection in-between tourist attractions.
First class public transport,Take it. Take the subway no matter where you are going. It's SO friendly. Easy. Safe. Understandable. Everything is in Korean AND English.And it takes you almost anywhere.Shoppings have their own station.Be aware that at 11pm passes the last train!!
Seoul Metro,"It is quite easy; just ask your front desk how to get to your destination. They will instruct you on what train to take, where to get off and will get the hang of it once you learn. The people try to do their best to be friendly and helpful, but sometimes so difficult to understand them since most of them are non-English speaking,."
Best in the World,"Efficient, clean, and everywhere. Download the Subway Korea app on your smartphone (available in English and Korean) and you can navigate your way throughout the city with ease. Rush hour is a nightmare, especially on the green line, but the transportation is cheap and easy. To purchase rides, you can buy a T money card at any convenience store and charge it there or in any metro station. Cost 2016 is 1250KRW per ride. You can use this card in taxis, on buses as well as the metro. It's a magnificent and must have part of your Seoul experience."
Wish the London Tube was like this...,"Clean, well maintained, dual (or more) language signs and announcements in Korean and English this is a straightforward underground system to navigate. It's less busy than many underground systems.They use a charge card system called t-card which came be topped up in stations or even at the convience stores. The reload machines have a straightforward option to switch to English. You clock in when going in, you clock out on leaving. I prefer it to the tubes oystercard. Also used on buses and some taxis.They even have little instructional videos playing on a loop on the trains to show you tube etiquette etc. They couldn't really make it simpler to use.Things that you can get caught out with: 1) if you hop on a train and it doesn't stop at the place you were expecting to you may have caught the express train on that line. Not all lines have them but it's easy to get caught out and have to catch a train a few stops back.2) when exiting a station note the entrance/exit number - the station exits can drop you out in drastically different locations and that could mean an extra 5+ min cab ride in rush hour or 10 min walk trying to get to where you need to be."
Inexpensive and easy to navigate,"Seoul Metro ranks in the top three of reasons I love Seoul. You can get anywhere in the city in an hour or less, including any of over a dozen gorgeous mountains, and it costs you less than $2. The stations gorgeous and well maintained and the trains are on time and clean. The people have no personal space and aren't aware of their surroundings. Also, talking is discouraged, Lol! But once you get used to some of the nuances of the system, there's no other way to travel!"
Not complicated. ,"Seoul Metro is easy and not as complicated as Japan. Convenient for foreigners whom understand English , Chinese and Japanese language using the machine . "
Great subway network,"Really clean, easy for foreigners and practical to go everywhere in and around Seoul. Great metro compared to european standards"
Very Impressive Metro System,Seoul should be the envy of many large cities for its efficient Metro System. There are clean bathrooms at most major stops. The prepaid tap card system makes getting around very easy.
Great Infrastructure!,"You can't beat the public transportation in Korea. It's amazing. The Metro is super easy once you get used to it. The directions are named by most popular stops, which was a bit confusing for me at first. I was used to the western method of using the stations farthest at the end. It's much faster than taxis or buses and will even take you outside of Seoul. "
I prefer the bus,"The metro or subway is a very good way to travel across the city and metropolitan area, but for myself prefer the bus, you walk less, in comparison is most expensive but for 1 or 2 usd more you don't get tired."
One of the best in the World,I lived in Seoul for 13 years and found the Seoul subway easy to use. Now when I come back I use it to get around the city. There are big maps at all the stations but it's best to have an idea where you are going before you start. Transfers are easy. If you are staying for a few days consider buying a T-Money card at any convenience store. T-Money can be used on buses too. You can also buy single ride tickets at machines; they are in several languages. 
Way easy and clean,"The Seoul metro is way easy to take. All the lines are numbered and color coded. Just make sure to grab a subway map and figure out what live you need to be on. Once you figure out the line, there are directional posts with the stops on the platform. The posts will tell you what side of the platform to stand on. Once you arrive at your desired station, there will be boards with the major attractions locations noted with the exit numbers... Just follow the desired exit number to your destination and you will be there! Very easy... Only drawback... If you do not like walking a lot or do like like taking a lot of stairs, I would suggest Google mapping the destination to see if there is a bus instead... 2 great reasons for taking the bus: 1) no need to climb stairs up and down as there are parts of the subway with no escalators... Just long flight gets of stairs and 2) you can see more of the city on a bus ride...."
Cheap and efficient ,"As known this subway is the bees knees. Basically free to use. Like 3000 won gets you a long ways. Many languages and helpful signs. No complaints despite our adventures got us temporarily lost, all in good fun."
Fabulous Public Transit System,"I travel quite a bit and have to say Seoul's metro is among the best I have seen/used. It is clean, cheap, and has extensive coverage of Seoul and surrounding areas. I also like that it is easy to use and offers announcements in several languages to include English as I don't speak or read Korean. Just load money on your card and you are set. One of the best deals is taking the metro or Airport Express (AREX) to both Gimpo and Incheon airports. It is very reasonable and super easy to do with stations at both airports. The only downside is if you have a lot of luggage. If you do I probably would take the bus as sometimes it is not easy to navigate the stairs/escalators in the metro stops. That is my only minor complaint about the Seoul metro--there are a lot of stairs and sometimes a good amount of walking to find the proper exit. Things are well marked though. I definitely recommend the metro for getting around Seoul."
Cheap and Easy,"The Metro was great. It was cheap, clean and easy. Once we had our bearings and were able to navigate using the map, we were able to access everything we wanted to see. Moreover, the extent of the Metro means that you are not limited by hotel location. As long as you are close to a Metro stop, you have access to the entire City. "
A-maze-ing,"Fast and furious! The maze like metro could get you places at an amazing speed and excellent price. Seats are never available though, so get your balancing skills ready if the hand rails are also full! An effective way to get around Seoul if you are good with mazes..but definitely not for the faint hearted 1st time traveller (unless you like thrills..and getting lost once or twice)"
Not Stroller friendly at all !,"i really suffered, since almost all train access are by stairs, and whenever there is an elevator, its out of service.somehow complicated, compared to other metros around the world."
Excellent way to travel anywhere in Seoul,"The subway map was initially overwhelming, but with the app download and a little advanced preparation, there was no better way to get around the city (even for non-Korean speakers). The cost is reasonable. You are issued a single trip card for which the deposit is returned upon journey completion. The subway has doors protecting passengers from on coming trains and this was by far the cleanest subway system we have used. We also felt very safe."
Easy to Use,We used the metro several times in Seoul. My daughter-in-law is South Korean and with her phone app was able to take us all over the city with no problem but I would not attempt to do this on my own.
Perfect!,"I found Seoul Metro the best of all the country I visited. Its even easier to ride and find your way here than in Japan and Paris. They have beautiful smart phone apps to help you on the way, just key in the stations from and to and it will tell you where to go. Metro price is also the cheapest train i have ever experienced. Its clean, accessible and lots of shopping centers along your walks. Did I say that the subways are all safe?Enjoy!"
Easy!,"You don't even have to speak Korea or know Hangeul ( the alphabet) to use it! Scan your card going in, and again when you exit. Simple!"
"Really easy to navigate, cheap to use","Travel cards can be bought from the machines and tapping in and out at the end of the journey is easy. The map is clear and easy to follow and the trains are frequent. It's probably the best metro out side of London, with the advantage of not being ad crowded "
Fast for getting around in the heart of Seoul,"This is a good way to get around town. It is clean, quiet and efficient. It is also cost effective. This is not recommended for trying to get Incheon airport as it can take a long time with many stops."
Convenient ,"The Subway in Seoul is excellent. The stations are a bit old in comparison with some Asian countries but overall it's functional. There's a little information counter just inside the gates where the service staff speaks very good English. The directional signs can be complicated at times but all in all.... At least one can get to the destination. Buying a ticket for a little confusing as it's all in Korean unless you are traveling to the main stations. A cost effective way of travel in Seoul. Yes, even to & fro from the airport.Tip: Get your hands on a subway map in a language of your choice before Travelling. "
Easiest Metro to use by far,"All lines are color codes so it is very easy to follow. You can use it to get literally anywhere in Seoul. Very safe and clean. Train are timely and often.When using it for the first time, note the station at the end of the line in the direction you want to go. The signs usually display the end station or other major stations in the direction you want to go. On the subway doors itself it will show the direction the train is going and the next stop. You can double check here to make sure you are going in the right direction."
Terrible only because of its people,"People are so rude and ill mannered, they push and bang into you without pardoning themselves or apologize for tripping you over. We always give way but no thank yous either. It's just expected that you get out of their way. Even when my friend's kid had to hold on to the railing down the stairs, people coming up would just stand there and glare.. and expect the kid to move away. So what is the korean culture.. respect at home only? What i learnt - basic is shove culture. Mad rush to reincarnate perhaps??Take the taxi instead as you only get pushed on the streets and not subway also. In fact, the cab is cheap as well."
Clean and on time,"In compared to NYC system, Seoul Metro was 5 stars!!! It was very clean and the trains were on time. Only bad thing is that the trains stop running at 12:00 midnight."
Good and easy,"Good way to transit in Seoul. Clean, easy, English signs. Takes you everywhere. You can almost all sightseeing by subway. The only negative point for subways in general when you are visiting a city is that you can't see it."
Subway in Seoul is so clean and easy to use.,"Subway in Seoul is so clean and easy to use. Especially when compared to subways in the U.S.I have taken the subway many times in major cities throughout the world, and one example of a bad subway is Bart in the Bay Area, which is so disgusting and nasty. And, the difference is so great when compared to subway in Seoul."
Best I've ever seen,"Love the Seoul metro system. I take it everywhere, and it will literally take you anywhere you want to go in Seoul or surrounding areas! Affordable, clean, safe, timely, convenient. "
"Super easy to use, once you get the hang of it.",Easy peasy once you've worked it out.Note down the next station you will arrive and the station at the end of the line.
fast & cheap,"Easy and Convenient, & acessable to all local attractions. Comfortable rides, only need to walk a bit far to train stations."
Interesting and systematic,It's better for travelers to download apps in their mobile phone for over all of the seoul metro maps. 
Effective transport system,"Like most subway/metro systems, this one works well. You have to work out your stations, but once you get the hang of it, it's not to bad, even for us English speakers. Signs and announcements are usually in English too.We bought a T-money card from a convenience store for 5000Won (we should get some of that back when we return the card at the airport), and loaded it with 20000Won for 7days, including the subway to Gimpo International airport to leave the country. It works not only for the subway but for buses too. Tap it when you get on and off.As another reviewer has noted, journeys are pretty cheap.We used the metro to get to most places we wanted."
best and most efficient way to get around the city,"many asian countries now have excellent subway system, but seoul is by far number one for it's cleanliness, efficiency, and reliability --- the only thing to be aware of is people with terrible manners... sorry if you're out of luck. if you're visiting for more than 3 days, i'd suggest purchasing a t-money card from a local 7=eleven/gs25/CU/with me store (they're everywhere, so you won't have a hard time finding at least 2 in the same block). they're about 3,000won per card (sorry if it went up.. it's been a while since i purchased one myself) and will save you a lot of time since you won't have to get the temporary card every time you go on the subway"
one of the best metro - free wifi,Seoul is extremely well connected. Get the T-Money card for easy tap n go travel. REmember to redeem your card for unused value at the G23 convenience shop (ther'es one at Seoul station just above the escalator from the counters) because there;s no similar service in the airport.
quick and easy,"get yourself a Tmoney card at any shop with the logo. on the metro you scan your card to get through the gate, so you will scan once in and once out. Remember to look at the remaining balance as you are scanning."
Get a Seoul City Pass,Get a Seoul City Pass and you get 20 rides per day free on the metro! The metro is easy to navigate with its colour and number coded system. English signs are available although not everywhere. Fast and efficient.
So cheap,"After living in Tokyo for a while it was nice to have a cheap metro. You can get the city pass card which you can reload and tap. The metro is pretty straightforward, the only thing that I thought was a problem was that there are 3 blue lines, which can look super similar in colour on google maps. And the lines are pretty spaced out so you have to travel kinda far before you can make a connection, if that makes sense.Also be prepared to walk a lot underground if you need to change lines."
Great Subway,"Have to have a T-Money card which you can get free at any subway station just look for the T-Money logo. Very well maintained, clean and stress free."
For an Efficient Travel!,"Seoul Metro is one of the most attractive points in Seoul. It is very convenient to move under dense traffic jam in Seoul. However, it is not comfortable condition as most public transportation systems. So, I recommend that you would like to use it in case of traveling by yourself."
"Cheap, On time, But many stations.","During my trip to Seoul I did not need to take taxies, thanks to Seoul Metro. The train is on time, and the price is reasonable. The stations are both announced in Korean and English. But the main problem is the too many stations in the way, which was somehow solved by the express option. However, not all the lines have this option."
Fast & Efficient,Enjoyed the efficiency of rail travel. The KTX station was near my hotel and I used the term ail system to get all over the pen. 
"On time, cheap, easy to use and clean - everything to love about it","I love taking the Metro as it has an extensive network, is always on time, is clean and you avoid the huge traffic jams topside. It is also relatively cheap, with tickets starting from around 1800 won, and you get a 500 won refund on the ticket deposit at the end of the journey.If you travel extensively via the Metro, you can buy a 'loaded' card where you can top up the cash amount as and when needed and it can also be used on buses etc. Or you can easily purchase single trip tickets at the station machines. Seniors and the disabled are also catered for - there are allocated seats on the train and lifts to and from the platforms. Do be mindful, though, that transfers between some stations could entail walking quite a distance. Destination announcements are in English, though I would usually download a Metro app or map beforehand, which helps in planning the trip."
Excellent Subway System,Seoul metro is a great transportation system. I used this during my visit. All station in city center area have a lot of shops. The trains are not too crowded during rush hours which is amazing. 
Once you get the hang of it...,"Getting around by Subway or Metro in Seoul is not much recommended for the city visitors. The bus lines are also easy to use and cheaper too. There are options to buy charge cards and city tickets, day tickets. Everything is written in English in the hallways of the metro. Its recommended to get an English metro map for better understanding, search and easy navigation. In 2 days, 2 person approached us to help us. Of course when we didnt need it the most! :-)Korea is generally more easy to get around by a lightyear than Japan!"
Seoul subway trains,"I ride the Seoul Metro at least twice a week, and am well pleased. It is certainly the easiest, most convenient way to get around Seoul, and get to all the important stops.Very easy, not complicated."
"Easy, cheap, and about the best there is",Navigating Korea by public transport is a snap and the subway can't be beat. Signs are in both Hangul and Roman letters. There are numerous apps out there to help you plot destinations and several info booths at major hubs.
Seoul Subway Experience,the subway is very amazing. You won't be lost having the directions everywhere. You'll be guided by the signages.
Public transportation in seoul for foeigner as well as korean.korean.,"It is very nice tool to trip in seoul every where.some of them connecting other cities such as Bundang, Ilsan, etc "
Be careful when changing trains,"The Seoul metro is designed to be functional. You don't see stations looking like museums, as in the Moscow metro. If you plan your trip in advance and then use the directions in the metro in English, most of the time you will be fine. However, in a couple of cases I was puzzled. The planner said I had to change from line 9 to line 4 on Dongjak station. On Dongjak I discovered that it was in fact a railroad station. Corresponding to line 4, there were several railroad tracks going in different directions. Fortunately, many younger Koreans speak English and are eager to help."
Extensive and clean.,"The metro connects to all districts of Seoul quite well. As compared to Paris and London, the cleanliness is a distinct pro, as is the tendency of people to leave seats open (for elderly and such). It felt hospitable and well-organized.The interval between trains can be high, though. And between midnight and 5 am the metro is closed."
Easy way to get around Seoul,"The Metro stop was just 2 short blocks from out hotel. Everyone was very helpful in orienting us to the system, especially the staff inside the Metro station. The stops were announced in Korean and then in English, with English spelling on the signs."
Subway system,"Seoul's subway system is one of the top subway systems in the world. It can be a bit overcrowded during rush hour, but it's high-tech and get's you from point A to B almost hassle free"
Great,"The Seoul subway is one of the best subways I've been on. It does get incredibly crowded and hot at times which is super annoying, but it's clean and has English, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean."
One of the best transit systems in the world,"Convenient, you can go anywhere in the city and connect to travel the county. Clean, there is no graffiti, or trash, it is amazing. Safe, multiple cameras, strategically placed emergency equipment, doors to protect travelers. Accessible to everyone including disabled, and elderly. Signs are in both Korean and English, as are the announcements. "
Fast n efficient,The station is clean although it's crowded. Station is well kept and clean. Organized and well informed with good information signage. 
Seoul ride,"We tried Seoul Metro on our way back to our hotel. The ride was just like any other train ride that I had before. The important things is, people may use this cheap means of transportation in South Korea."
"Good navigation, very clean and quite","Good navigation, very clean and quite. Very modern. The problems only if you missed a station, you need to exit and entrance again."
Very useful,The subway in Seoul is THE mean of transportation everyone uses. There are about 15 different lines which enable to get you everywhere in Seoul and around. A one way ticket is 1350 won. I would suggest to buy a T-money card (can be purchased in any convenient store). You can put money on the card and each trip costs you 1250 won (instead of 1350 won).In the morning and the evening it is usually very very crowded (especially on line 2).
Fun and very exciting.,"This isn't my first time to ride a subway, but it was so interesting and how you get really eager to know which station you are on, just want to say a massive thank you for having a translation in the subway, almost got lost but it was really worth it. "
Efficient and easy to use,"Needs some getting used to, but its efficient, safe and not expensive.get an app to help you navigate through it"
"Dirt cheap and fast, beware of closing times","I reckon Seoul is on the right track in terms of infrastructure. Trains from the airport to the city and cheap (compared to Japan), frequent and fast. The only drawback are the operation hours which seem to stop around 11 pm. A handy app for Android and iPhone is available that let you plan your transfers offline, search for subway Korea in the app store."
Lifts in Station,"There is nothing bad about the metro. It is good and efficient. However, one thing lack is the provision of lifts. For travelers with luggages, you may have to drag your luggages up and down the stairs. "
Such an efficient subway system!,I can't help but to complement the timeliness and convenience of the Seoul Train system. It's pretty much on-time and so reliably extensice that you can forgo the need of buying a car in Seoul. The downside is that it ends around midnight but other than that it's simply awesome!
So clean!!,"Seoul Metro is wonderful. It's clean and easy to understand. if you spent some days in seoul you should get a special card that you can load with T money (special money you can use in transportations and also some spots like 7eleven). We live in Paris and I usually don't like to take the metro (bad smell, dirty..). A pleasure here in Seoul."
Cheap & Convenient,Seoul can have traffic jams which might double your journey time by car/taxi. Seoul metro is the best and cheap way. It covers each and every corner of the city so you can move around anywhere.Stations have directions in English so that's helpful.
really easy to use metro,"there are many apps in the store to help you use seoul metro. the metro system itself is easy , convenient and cheap"
The best metro I've ever been on.,"I've been on metros in the US, Europe, Hong Kong and Korea. Seoul's metro (equaled by Busan's) is the best in my opinion. It's clean. There are few, if any, panhandlers and pickpockets. People are generally very courteous and well-behaved in the subway (I saw only one kind of drunk guy on one ride). And, the subway cars are big and clean. As with most subways, the lines are color coded. As with most, it is necessary to know what direction you are going. If you've guessed wrong, while you're waiting for the next train, there is a sign above the entrance doors that shows the direction of travel and the name (in both English and Korean characters) of the next stop. It's sort of a last chance to change your mind. We never had to wait long for a train. And, the train's impending arrival is announced with music. Inside the cars are screens that indicate the next stop and which side of the car to exit. There are handicapped areas on select cars (also identified on the platforms) for wheelchairs/scooters to park. If you've got luggage, it is also more space for you to stand or sit with it. The easiest way to use the subway is to get a rechargeable T-money card (get them at 7-11 or numerous other convenience stores). You can add money (cash only) at machines in the subway station (you can also get your money, minus a fee, refunded at select machines or do the same at the 7-11, etc.). You can buy the single journey tickets. But, it's so easy to swipe the T-money card entering and exiting the subway turnstiles. by the way, the same T-money card works for the buses. I would recommend downloading any of several Seoul subway apps to your smartphone. It allows you to identify the correct lines, the direction you want to go, the stops, etc. One thing to remember is that they are not real big on elevators and escalators at all stations. Climbing and descending stairs is a way of life here. If you've got luggage, remember that. Also remember that the underground stations can be huge, multi-level affairs, depending upon how many lines service that station. Most of the stations have shopping areas that resemble mini-malls with food and all kinds of goods. The station bathrooms we used were pretty clean, maybe not like the Swiss but certainly not like NYC."
Favorite transport,"It's my favorite..Cheap, clean, convenient.Elders, women and disabled-person have their space here.You can find the train-pass in every station altogether with tourism counter.Their English speaking staff is so helpful.It is easy to reach your destination/station, the routes & signages are clear & simple.There are few mobile applications also to check the fastest route you wanna go somewhere & other recent information."
Seoul Subway,"Under the hotel there are three Seoul subway lines crossing 3, 7 and 9 route. Once you know how to use the subway system, it can get you almost anywhere in Seoul without getting caught in traffic."
Metro,One of the best world wide easy and simple Excellent for busy city transportation clean and all do respect visitor
Very Convenient!!,"The metro going everywhere in Seoul! i love the idea of the T-money card. You can use at 7-11, G25 or even pay for taxi. "
"Very Clean Trains and Stations, Excellent Service",Used the metro for all of our sight seeing tours. Super convenient and cheap. It is a little hard to read the maps as there are so many lines intersecting throughout the city. Best to google your destination station before you go to the ticket machine.
Great system,"I love the Seoul metro system. I was worried before visiting Korea as I thought I wouldn't know how to use it but it's very straight forward. There's an English app you can download called Seoul Subway and you can search how to get from one station to another. It's very straight forward and this app saved my life! I used it every single day. The stations are also written in English on signs but it's hard to know how to get from A to B without the app and it's hard to find someone who speaks English at the station. In Korea they use POP cards which you can buy at the local store for about 5$. You then use the machines in the subway stations to top up your card. Very straightforward and in English!! You beep your card in and out of the subway stations and it takes the money off. It's very cheap though. And you can use the POP cards on buses and the bigger buses that go quite far too so that's convenient. The metros themselves are very big and always so clean and running on time. I've never experienced metros like it, they are just immaculate. "
"Fast, econimical, and cheap!",This is a great way to get around Seoul. I have used it for short and long trips through Seoul. My only hint is to pay attention to the EXITS! When you get directions to anywhere ask what exit to use. They can be blocks apart in some cases. 
cheap convenient clean and safe,"one price 1050won takes you to any place in seoul, plus unlike japan the tickets are recycle-able credit card sized ones that you can redeposit after your trip for a 500won refund. "
Well done system,"Very clean, efficient and cheap. Access to all areas of the city with color coded maps. Recommend that you have a map ahead of time to plan your route."
my favorite transportation mode in Seoul,"- Easiest way to travel around Seoul, you can get almost everywhere by the metro- You can use either cash or the T-Money card, so fuss free!- I love using the metro, as one of its station is so near to the guesthouse I stayed at"
Very reliable,"The train is usually always crowded, but very reliable and cheap. It is also easy to navigate and did I mention reliable? "
Easy and clean!,Subways in Seoul are vey easy to use. it's very clean and air conditioned in the summer. It's also the fastest method of transportation.
"Clean, modern, and efficient","Like most subways in Asia this one was just as clean, fast, and efficient. Got me all around Seoul for cheap!"
Easy !,Buy a city pass for 3000 KRW in Jan 2016.It is very easy to find your way. People respect the seats for elder people.Information screens inside the train and they announce in several languages the stations.Can't miss your station.
Tips for Finding Your Way,"Once you learn a few tips, the subway is easy. It's safe and very clean. It wound up being my preferred mode of transportation once I figured it out. Here are a few tips:1) Make sure you know the NEXT stop on the line you're on. Most subways use the last stop as a directional, but not this one - all the key signs above the entrance to the train, show direction based on the next stop. You'll see two stops on either side of the current stop and there will be an arrow pointing on one of them. 2) Ignore the name of the train announced by the voice. For whatever reason, the name of the train coming has no relation either to the stop or to the line or to the end of the line - i couldn't figure this out and everytime i heard a voice say ""the xyz train is coming"" i got confused. I just ignored it and I was fine.3) Pay close attention on the train. There is a digital display but it's mostly Korean but does flash a quick bit of english. It's easy to miss though. 4) Bring your reading glasses if you need them! The english names are so small on the maps I couldn't read them!5) Use the subway app -- this was a savior - you can download easily and then put in current location and where you're going and it tells you which route to take. The annoying thing is it doesn't tell you which direction to travel - but you can just look at the next stop and figure it out.6) The ticket machines have english and I bought a card each time (1,850 won). What it took me a bit to figure out was after you end your ride and you exit, look for a deposit machine and put your card in and you'll get 500 won back.7) Know your line number ! Know which line you're going to transfer to -- if you know that moving around and transferring is really easy and well marked.8) Know the Exit station number for where you're going. Some of these stations have 10 exits !!! If you take the wrong one you are really hurting. 9) Lots of steps - Although the subway is very modern there are many exits that have no elevator and no escalator - I did a LOT of stair climbing. If you have difficulty with stairs, consider taking a cab instead."
Easy and quick to get around,"The quickest and most convenient way to get around Seoul. Foreigner friendly with english signs, announcements onboard and ticket vending machines. Buy yourself a t-money card, load it up and you'll be able to swipe it on the metro as well as buses and taxis! Even if it's crowded in rush hours, people will stand in orderly lines while waiting and there's no pushing and shoving onboard."
Great Transport System,From where I was staying I took the metro everywhere especially to Dongdaeman and to Anguk to visit the Bukchon Hanok village. I even took it to the airport on my way back. With a T card you can travel anywhere.
Convinent,"A good way to travel around the city especially travelling between popular places like Myeongdong to Gangnam. Trains are easy to use with announcements made in different languages like english which is good for travellers that does not know korean. Metro is clean and efficient and trains comes on time. The metro also features a monitor which you can see live of where the next train is which is a cool feature! The only negative thing about the metro is especially when you have to change between lines, some lines you have to walk long distances just to get to the other platform which can tire one out easily."
one of the best in the world,efficient reliable fast and easy to understandcan access so many places even direct airport express
Massive network,"Seoul is a megacity served by a mega metro network. I did the trip from central Seoul to Incheon (a distance of ~50 kms) which 2 hours and I paid just $2.5. Rather amazing. All the signboards are in English. The network is very extensive and so do your research on the optimal route before you board. It also gets very crowded. Some of the lines (e.g. Blue) have different start and end points, so check whether you are on the right train."
Not to difficult to use,Better to download application for Seoul Metro and use with the manual sign at the station. because the app doesn't tell you which way you have to head to.
Very Clean and Comfy,Very Clean and you see a lot of useful items during your ride. Please avoid on and off work hr. Other than that it is a fun ride. You can also ride to airport. Very convenience...
"good transportation, but be prepared to walk","The metro brings you to all major tourist attractions in Seoul. Buy a rechargeable card at the airport or wherever (7/11 and other venues), charge it when you run out of money on your card. I never quite understood the tariff system, I think you are charged for a direct trip, and then 100 KRW for each transfer. Every time you swipe your cad, the remaining sum appears so you know how much you have got left. Lines are marked in a different colour each, and before getting on the train you see where it goes. Beware, on some lines there are express services which only stop at main stations. The metro is very clean and in every station there are several toilets (free access) and even rooms for babies. Transfers from on line to another can take you for a long walk. So better check your map and walk out on the street. It may be quicker to reach your destination."
Warm Seats,A fast frequent easy to use service with warm seats in the winter. Ticket machines easy to use but English speaking helpers often to hand. Safe and friendly.
Signage and Announcements in English,"The Seoul Metro (subway) is safe, clean, reliable and easy to use even for those who only know English. Signs are in Korean, Chinese and English and announcements are in Korean and English. Certain routes can be really busy at peak times - morning and evening rush hours Monday thru Friday, so expect to stand for parts of your journeys. The subway cars do have seating designated for elderly, handicapped, and expecting mothers.Subway stations are very clean and easy to maneuver."
clean and quiet,"easy to use and extremely quiet also,notice the stations all have full length mirrors,so you get to the street looking your best."
easy to use and safe,"I travel to Seoul frequently for business. Seoul Metro has always been my main transportation method. It took couple of rides to understand the network and system. On board announcement is in Korean and English, maps too. There are many apps out there that helps plan your route. The good news is wireless is available for free. Sometimes specially during rush hours it get crowded and smelly (kimchi). Trip price vary from 1000₩ to 2000₩. enjoy your ride."
Easy and cheap way to cross town," The subway is the easiest way to get around the city. Even to city suburbs, where the hiking trails start. Never feelt uncomfortable or threatened, loved traveling during rush hour. This way you see some people sleeping while standing in the tube."
Easy to use and very clean,"I always use the underground to get around City, I downloaded the app in English, so getting lost is not really possible, all the Stations are called out in American, so not any problems there, if you are getting on abit, they have seats only for elder people, which is a very good idea, you can get anywhere you want to go! "
make your journey easy,"you can use it to save time and money and you can visit a lot of places, very clean , on time , and very safe"
On time arriving,Seoul Metro is the best public transport i have use. It's arrived on time as show in arrival time board. You can use Seoul Metro to go every part of Seoul City with cheap fees.
extensive metro and convenient,seoul metro is extensive but easy to navigate. thankful that their are apps available for smart phones to guide tourist where to hop on and off of the metro. 
Very easy ,It is very easy and there is no way you will get lost in thereEverything is also in english Ticketing is easy and people helpful
The UK could learn from this,"Clean, air conditioned and comfortable. Easy to navigate and plenty of stops to avoid walking in the heat of summer"
Great connectivity,"economical, Convenient and safe mode of transportation in Seoul Korea. Take a pass and just hop on to discover the city. "
Amazing metro system,"Seoul has a great metro system. It's colour coordinated and easy to use. Most importantly, just pay attention to the signs on top of the subway to not get lost. And the best part, is that taking the subway is super affordable !"
Nice clean way to get around.,Seoul has a nice subway system which is easy to navigate and a quick way to get around the city. If you are going to be in the city for a day or two why not get a pass and have unlimited rides around to all the major Seoul destinations.
Confusing but clean and efficient!,"Navigating Seoul's metro is a challenge experienced and calm travellers will master readily, but is not as easy as it should be!The positives are that tickets can be bought from machines with and English button to press. Also the trains are wide and spacious - although busy. Finding the right line is easy through colour coding but (here is a negative!) finding the right direction is much less easy because of poor signing. (Most signs are in Korean and English) that helps! Once on the train, it is easy to tell which stop is yours because of electronic announcements and information boards. We managed OK. But stay calm - and be ready to ask locals!"
Sub way,Seoul Sub way is clean and fast safe for travel wher ever you want to go you can i found cheep way of traveling
so so easy,really efficient fast and cheap what a joy to use the system is clearly signed and many announcements are made in english
The Seoul subway makes NYC Subway system look so obsolete!,"I managed to master the Seoul Metro on my second outing, and that says so much about how easy to navigate the routes, the tourist-friendly instructions, the bilingual announcements, and the oh so warm and comfy seats, in the middle of the winter! Thanks too to the courteous and orderly riders. Kudos to you all! I will be back!"
One of the best Metro systems,"Travelled alone in Seoul for six days in January 2016. Stayed in Myeongdong and took lots of metro rides. Fast, clean, very easy to use. The only complaint is some of the stations do not have lift or escalator. Could be a bit difficult for the elderly and tourists with big suitcases. "
"Fast, easy, comfortable","The Seoul Metro is fantastic. Very modern, great understandable schedules, and a quick place to get from A to B with little expense. I used it a lot when in Seoul, and fortunately there was a station right on my block. The cars are very clean, graffiti-free, and comfortable. Be sure to ride the metro when you're in Seoul. "
Easy Traveling,"I would suggest to purchase T-money card as you pay as you travel if you won't be travelling all in 1 day. It has very convenient to purchase the T-money card. You can purchase the card from the vending machine located at the station itself. After purchase you can top up the value and start using it. Inside the metro station, there are 4 languages announcement, English, Mandarin, Korean & Japanese and as well screen display. It is hassle free travelling within Seoul."
Most convenient and economical transportation!,"I have taken many subways in the world but I think Seoul metro was the most convenient transportaion.You can go almost every famous places in Seoul with the metro, paying just 1 to 2 dollars and colors & numbers of each line will make you transfer to other line very easily.It is also clean, safe. Highly recommendable!"
Not always the most intuitive,"I live in Hong Kong and find it to be the easiest of the subways on Asia. Coming back to Seoul, I do find the subway is a bit confusing in areas. For example, I was trying to take the Orange line from Dogok to Sinnonhyeon and after arriving at the Express Bus Terminal to transfer, it was so convoluted and confusing, I had to exit out of the maze of exits at the EBT and just took a taxi. "
Very convenient and orderly even though it was crowded,This metro service in Seoul is rather huge with many stops and at first the map looks daunting but it is doable. There are numerous sign in English and difficult to get lost. It is crowded but not as crowded as Beijing’s Subway. What I liked best about it is that there is nobody pushing and shoving you and the restrooms aren’t disgusting. I found it to be very efficient and much cheaper than a taxi. I’d highly advise you get a metro card and use the system for transportation and of course you can use the metro card for fares on buses.
convenient,Seoul Metro helps you get around the city fairly easily. I would recommend avoiding rush hours on Line2 since it gets very crowded.
Amazing system!,"Even that is not really new, the seoul metro system is amazing. Foreigners friendly, all the signals are on english and some of the staff speak it. The connectivity is amazing and is taking you no more than 40 minutes to cross the hole city. Not too clean or new but is secure and by metro you can arrive to almost all the attractions."
Incredibly respectful and helpful people!,"I was only a few times in the Seoul metro, because of the. language I was kind of scared about using it, but it is very well signaled in English, and, once, a very respectful young Man even missed his oportunity to catch the metro in order to help me finding the correct exit Gate for me to get to Dongdaenum Design Plaza (DDP). THANK YOU. ALL KOREAN PEOPLE!!!!!"
Happy,"Very convenience surprised me English language is announced on metro and on time too. Clean, smooth and easy to connect to everywhere in Seoul,, happy."
Great way to get around,"The Metro is clean and efficient. Easy to understand and get around. The ticket vending machines have English and you just select your destination station, the number of tickets you need, and insert the money. You will be charged 500 w for each ticket. When you complete your journey you will find refund machines in the ticket vending area, where you insert the used ticket and it returns your 500 w for each ticket."
Easy to use,"Its for me the best way to getting around the city, its cheap and easy to use. The only negative thing is, that if you take the last trip to the airport, you get your deposit in coins, so its lost. But its only a small amount."
Fast,Korea subway fast and clean wher ever you want go can go easy I like to travel with Korean subway thank you Korean subway
It's not easy,"I'm not for the first time in Seoul. But always I have several time problems to understand were I should go to get to the right place. I have several apps with maps, no luck. Thanks to english speaking Korean people!!"
"Quick, clean and easy to use.","You will need a T-money card to enter and leave. These can be bought and topped up using a machine or at convenience stores. The money on your card can also be used to buy things from convenience stores and also for normal taxis I was told. You hold the card flat on the reader at the top of the enter/exit barriers. The interchanges between lines can involve a lot of walking. The trains are very frequent, clean and spacious. If you are used to any metro/underground/subway system, this works pretty much the same way. There are also not many lifts/escalators so if you are travelling with a lot of luggage you may need to spend extra time to locate them - I don't think I'd bother using it if I had luggage as taxis are good value in Seoul."
Easy Ride,Very easy to navigate. I am american and I do not know Korean but if you study the maps ahead of time and identify where you want to get on and off the metro it is pretty easy to navigate. Also the price is very affordable. 
Wish all public transportation were like that,"Soul subway system is perfect you can go everywhere around the city with confort, security and easy. You can buy tickets and search maps in english. The tip is download the subway app"
Conveniently take you where you would like to go,"This is the first time for our family at Seoul. The metro system is really convenient. There are many exits for each station, which can conveniently take you to different destinations. And the underground shopping is another unforgettable experience. "
Little hard understand,The notice board is hard of understanding. The cost fee is more expensive than Singapore metro.I by Tmoney card at G25 with 4000 won but the balance of card is just 0won.
easy and convenient,"Easy to navigate, clean and convenient. Plenty of signs in English and helpful attendants. Better form of transportation than bus!"
No better way to travel - simply one of the best metros in the world,"In my opinion there are only a handful of metros that are on par with the Seoul Metro system. Very easy to use service that gets infinitely easier if you get yourself a T-Money public transport card. It will allow access to the subway, bus, and other public transport facilities.As for the metro itself, almost all major tourists attractions will be near a subway station meaning you could almost travel exclusively by subway and get to wherever you need to go within Seoul and accompanying areas."
"Clean, safe and easy to navigate","The metro is clean, safe and easy to navigate as the maps, ticket machines and info screens all have English as well. Given the size of Seoul this can be a cheap and useful way of getting around the city."
Travel by Seoul Metro everyday when I was there,I bought a T-money card and travelled by Seoul Metro everyday when I was there. Needed to wait a little bit off peak hours but it was OK.
Comfortable public transportation in Seoul,"The easiest way to hanging around Seoul up to suburb area is the Seoul Metro (subway), Intercity Train Express or ITX, and Korean Railway since they operates day and night. Passenger could make reservation in advance of travel date (for ITX) either through the ticket offices or book online, and make payment by credit cards, cash or T-cash. For daily transportaion, it is easy, fast and cheap to use subway. The sign of the transfer route, maps and ticket boot/offices are available mostly everywhere in subway stations."
"Transport network is well developed, but environment of the stops and facilities need to be improved","The Seoul metro is the main way of transportation means for travelers for its convenience. One can arrive at most tourist spots by the metro apart from the N Seoul Tower. However, some exits of the stations are not connected to tourist sites and the directions are not clear. Also, it is very difficult to find staff at stations to seek help when you encounter problems such as the ticket doesn't work. But one should still use the metro as your transport method."
Very clean,The metro was easy to navigate. The trains and terminals were well maintained and cleaned. People were polite getting on and off. Only downside is entrances are stairs. There are elevators nearby those entrances those.
Perfect,"The subway in korea is perfect, you arrive in anyplace very fast!it's not so expensive, you need to pay around 2000 won."
Hassle free travels with Seoul Metro,"Seoul Metro is definitely a hassle free mode of transportation. It has so many stations and connecting lines which makes it easier for tourists like us to find which trains to take to reach our destinations. Every station has numbers of ticketing machines that can accommodate thousands of passengers everyday. The trains are wide and long. They have specific instructions where the elders, pregnant women and disabled people can seat. There are four languages used whenever the train would make a stop to a specific station; in Korean, Japanese, Chinese and English. They have safe waiting areas as there are glasses divisions that opens up synced with the train doors. Koreans do take the subways more often that riding taxis as it is cheaper and faster. Truly one of the best Metros in the world."
super metro,use the metro in seoulvery clean very easyboth in English and koreanget you every where quick andeasythus its about 6 us one wayso if you are fee people its a good idea to share a texi instead
"Inexpensive, Clean, and Easy to Navigate.","When I first moved to Korea, I had no access to a car and had no idea which buses to take, so I used the Seoul Metro almost exclusively. Why? Because the metro goes just about anywhere you need to go in Seoul, it is inexpensive, clean, and English place names and directions make it easy to navigate. The Seoul Metro system provides an app that you can use on your phone to figure out the fastest way to get to your destination or the easiest way to get to your destination (fewest transfers); sometimes the fastest way is the same as the way with the fewest stops. Subway stations are very clean, usually have some sort of convenience store and other stores in them, and if you need help, you can get it. I like that I was able to buy a card that I can load with money like a debit card and use it for not only metro transportation, but also bus and some taxi transportation as well. If you plan to be in Seoul for a while, get a card. Many hotels, stores, restaurants and other businesses give directions using the nearest metro station as a point of reference, showing how ubiquitous the system is. Public transportation in South Korea is amazing!"
Easy to use and clean,"Easy to navigate (Subway app is in English) and clean. Well-maintained, good safety procedures, always on time (within 1-2 minutes) and well sign-posted in English, Korean and Mandarin."
Fantastic ,Seoul metro is one of the best in the world. Signs are in Korean and English and Chinese and Japanese sometimes. Transfers are easy and it's inexpensive.
Great Infrastructure,"Living in South Korea and getting around is most likely the Best Infrastructure in the World...Subways are the best, Buses go everyplace you desire and Many Taxi's to get you to your destination quickly...After living here I have become spoiled...I visited Los Angeles California and without a rented car your out of luck for Travel..."
"Efficient, Cheap, Excellent","Seoul, and most of Korea, deserves a lot of credit for the public transportation system. Cost, efficiency, and reliability are all exceptional. Some things to be aware of include opening and closing times. Even if the first/last trains are listed you must be aware of when the train will arrive at your station. It could be a significant time difference. Also, local manners are generally quiet on the subway and buses and not much eating or drinking is normal."
Great subway system.,"So convenient, inexpensive and easy for English speakers to use. There is an express train, and th rgular trains with more stops. The express train is slightly more expensive, but still very reasonable."
Wonderful way to look around the city,"Seoul is big, busy, and troublesome with traffic. If you take the metro, you don't have to worry at all. It will connect you to the right places easily. It offers you sone discount also. "
