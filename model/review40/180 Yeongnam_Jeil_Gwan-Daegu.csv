Nice,"This ancient door of the city has been rebuild in a close suburb on new foundations (close to the Inter Burgo Hotel, not where it is indicated on the T.Adv. map). It is a classical Korean architecture, quite spectacular, especially at night, but not exceptional. Worth a look if you pass by otherwise no need for a detour."
Beautiful Temple,We spent about 20 minutes here walking through the park which is tucked away in an industrial area surrounded by trees. The view of the temple at night was fantastic.
