Interesting building situation at a family friendly park along the river.,"Great place to visit! I visited during Chuseok and the place was relatively busy with family's, teenagers and tourists. I would highly recommend hiring a bike (or one of the scooter / motor bike things) and riding along the river as it is extremely beautiful!"
Special and beautiful building,"I like the building itself, like a spaceship from outer space. If you visit in the late afternoon, you could see the beautiful sunset over the river and the night lighting casting over the building. Inside the building actually there is nothing else but few exhibition rooms. The location of the arc is remote. The nearest subway station, Daesil Station, provides free bikes to tourists, which is nice, however, the staff asked for a local phone number to rent the bike, which we didnâ€™t have. We ended up looking for help from the B&B owner who was nice to give out his phone number so that we got the bikes. It took us 10mins ride from subway station to the arc, and we saw many bike renting shops along the road to the arc. We were lucky to have nice weather the day we visited, like many local people did there, we spent some time sitting by the river bank to look at the sunset and riding across the river through the bridge. Such an enjoyable riding!"
A peculiar building in a scenic setting,"The Arc is by the weir, and you can hire bicycles, electric scooters or segways, or just walk to it. The building was closed when I visited but there were still good views"
Nature and water,"From far, it looks like a spaceship but it is the arc. The arc is 3 quarter surrounds by the water-river. The place allows you to picnic, cycling, boating, walking, running and the used of personal mobility device which can be rented from the shops nearby.On the ground floor of the arc, there is display about water and nature, On the top floor, there is a cafe to have a cup of coffee and a bite. Out from the cafe, there is viewing deck to enjoy the surrounding water and nature."
"The Arc doesn't float, its just Next to the River","The Arc is a modern structure the west side of Daegu outskirts. It's a three story building with an art exhibit and hands on experiences on the ground floor and a two story circular theatre above that highlights the nature of water. There is a nice Pascucci Cafe on the top deck with an observation platform overlooking the area. Its a grand panorama with views of the river and bridge, but not much else. Its a lovely place to walk, run, segway or scooter around as there is a lot of open space. Tons of cheap scooter/ segway rentals in the area. You can also enjoy your lunch under one of the permanent umbrellas along the Nanking. Outside exhibits like fountain performances during the summer. The arc lights up at night making it very pretty. Disappointed I couldn't find a lot of English information on site, but the young girl in Pascucci's spoke very good English. Open everyday, but the theatre is closed today (Monday). All in all, I'm glad I went it was warm day for a walk around the Arc and a little soccer with some kids."
"Well, maybe not during a weekday in september","It was a nice trip to rent segways and cruise around the arc and the bike roads along the river, but the area around the arc was really quiet on a thursday in september. Maybe there are more activities during the summer and holidays, we were almost completely alone. A segway costs around 10,000W/hour. 2 Hours was enough to see the Arc and a few places near by it. And the batteries of the segways almost ran out in two hours."
Great place for a Segway trip,"The Arc it self isn't anything special to see, but the river and the roads by it were nice to explore with a Segway. The Segways are really easy to rent. There are a lot of rental shops among the main road to the Arc. They are also really affordable, 10k Wons per hour. so if you want to see the surroundings and other parts of the outskirts of Daegu this is the nicest way. "
A Unique Structure in a remote location,Anyone looking to experience a ride on the Bullet train could easily make the ARC a rewarding destination for a day trip from Seoul. It is located outside Dongdaegu about 2 stations from the end of the subway line. From memory we alighted at Daesil station. Some reviews mention bikes being available but we could not find them so decided to take a cab. 
Plan your transport,Interesting site to visit but plan your transport as it is a little out of town. As such we did not stay around to explore inside as other reviews suggested it was not worth it. We took a taxi from the metro stop (daesil- green line) as there are limited options to get there. Costs around 5000 won to get there. We had the taxi wait and take us back as did not look like any taxis around for return fare. 
What a strange but cool looking building,So I found this building whilst searching here on trip advisor. Decided to pop over for a visit. The weather didn't help as its by the river so it was exceedingly cold :( But the view is something else so it's worth seeing. It is apparently quite a recent build and no that many people will know about it but as an advisor I should tell you that it's a nice romantic place to visit. You should also go at a time when its open. It was closed when I went in the evening but there is a cafe on the top Floor for you to relax and enjoy a little. You will get many a lovely picture if your into that type of thing so have fun. 
Great event venue,I have run two 10K races staged at the Arc. Both events were well run and the Arc was a beautiful venue and quite accommodating to all participants. A lovely park and location.
the arc... beautiful in daylight... mesmerizing when sun goes down..,"Many people say that this is a new landmark in Daegu... This is indeed a nice place to hangout with your friend and family. In summer there is an outdoor water swimming pool specially for the kids. There is roads for bike... so you can rent many varieties of cycle ( one, two and three wheel electric scooter and traditional bicycles). 1000 won rent for the two wheel electric scooter. The ARC has exhibition halls and cafe and an observatory place. This place is situated beside a river, so nice little breeze will fresh your mind when you walk or ride the bike across the road beside the river. ARC is more fascinating at night with stunning lighting. Also the bridge on the river looks really beautiful at night. Directions[Subway + Bus]Daesil Station (Daegu Subway Line 2), Exit 2.- Take a right and walk straight for 130 m and take Bus Seongseo 2. - Get off at Gangjeongbo (The Art Cultural Center) Bus Stop. - From the bus stop, the venue will be located within 553 m on foot for 8 minutes."
Nice park. Boring place,"The ARC is a weird, overrated museum. However, the park it sits in is a very nice place. Enjoy the park, laugh at the ARC. "
Architecture- plus; transportation- minus,"The Arc is an impressive building out on the edge of Daegu. The external design is quite interesting in shape and texture.The permanent exhibit about water is educational and high tech. The 360 screening of short animations was cool but didn't appear to have much of a unifying theme except movement. The view from the open area at the top reinforces how far from the center it is and how much water there is in the area. It is a nice view but not stunning, at least in this season From the photo exhibit inside it appears to be the venue for various exhibits and installations.There is the ubiquitous cafe inside but it feels closed in and dark due to the lack of windows in the designTo reach the Arc you take the metro almost to the end of line 2 and then an infrequent bus plus a 15 minute walk or take a taxi from the metro. The return busses seem even more infrequent and taxis are very rare.Alternately you can bring your bicycle or rent one for free at the metro station to take advantage of the nearby long, flat paths along the river. We ended up walking 30 minutes back to the station and luckily could follow a group of Korean walkers to we would have been lost. Unless you are walking or biking, I suggest visiting the area when there is an event, as it requires a bit of time to get there and you risk being frustrated by the transportation and under whelmed by the area. As the city develops this corner it should become more of a destination."
