Interesting city musuem,"There are very few activities to do in Masan but we discovered three places to visit on the hill above Masan busy streets, the Changwon City Masan Museum was one of them. I'm not sure if there was an entrance fee as we just walked, the attendant did not stop us as we walked on in passed the temporary exhibition room and up the stairs to the permanent exhibition. On this second floor a breif history of Changwon is covered from Prehistoric times, then to the Japanese invasion of Korea in 1592, traditional village life in Masan with some great displays on fishing techniques, to the Masan revolution on the 15th of March 1960 and lastly the development of free trade zone in the region. It took us a little under thirty minutes to explore the mueum, there were sufficient English explanations for us to understand the displays, when there was no English translations the good quality artifacts told their own story. The musuem used multi-media throughout: short films, photographs, visual and written displays. At the far end of the second floor exhibits was a children's activity space. This was an enjoyable and enlightening small musuem."
Korea before winter,"From Incheon we went to Masan and spend our entire trip there. The city was small and calm. The people were so helpful, friendly and polite. "
a nice museum with some good exhibits and a lovely sculpture garden outside,"Changwon City Museum is nice. There was a good temporary exhibit of Turkish art when we visited, which was interesting. It was good to see such a small, regional museum attempting to offer international perspectives on art. The sculpture garden outside the museum is the real draw to visiting, but the museum itself is well worth an hour of your time if you're in the area."
Small museum,It's a small museum that gives a bit of local culture. It's free! I enjoy it as a current resident of the city and it's nice to learn something!
