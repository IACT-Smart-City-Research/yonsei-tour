Must visit in Busan,Such a beautiful place and the way they invent for a bridge and cable car is awesome. I went at noon and quite full with crowd but still managed to spent some times here.
Songdo Skywalk,"One of the stops of our Busan Day tour, Songdo Skywalk is a nice place to have a stroll. We came in the afternoon and a bit windy.Not so crowded.You can also take the cable car."
Good choice for a peaceful weekend evening,super fun and relaxing. The cable car experience was marvellous. Good place for everyone from kids to adults.
"Not comparable with Dutch beaches, but still good for a nice beach day !!","If you visit accommodation in Nampo-dong and surroundings when visiting Busan, you can reach Songdo Beach with buses 30 and 96 for around 1 euro per person in 12 minutes. It is a fairly large beach, with many umbrellas and shading constructions, with mainly straight chairs and tables underneath, which were used in the weekends by fully dressed bathers, who, also with fully covered skin, including head cover and footwear, fitted with a life jacket and a large swim tire, went into the sea.On weekdays the picture was different because a lot of beach furniture had been stored away and the bathers were mostly dressed in -1- and -2-piece swimwear. Although interesting on weekends, it was considerably more pleasant on weekdays. On the fine sand beach, just above the surface, there were a lot of small flies that initially looked like sandflies, but turned out to be harmless. The sea is very safe by Dutch standards, but safe bathing is nevertheless ensured by a beach brigade.For visitors who want more than sunbathing and bathing, there is a Skywalk and a Cable car, among other things."
Nice beach,We explore the beach in the morning and the weather was cool. It wasn’t very busy and we enjoyed the view. Then we took the Air cruise cable car to Songdo Skypark. 
Very clean beach and good facilities ,"We came here as part of a day tour and had an hour to spend. It gave us plenty of time to walk along the bridge walk and beach front.If you fancy, there is a cable car that gives you views across the city."
Small but nice,"Songdo is a small but nice beach. It's touted as the first official beach in South Korea. Haeundae and Gwangalli are definitely bigger, but Songdo had nice sand and looked very clean. The skywalk is nice, but nothing too crazy. The statues and stories make it nice. If you go during non-popular times, its a nice little place to hang out. Didn't have time to swim or take the cable car due to long lines, but a nice little nook with some extra history. Definitely more windy than the other 2 beaches, though. The murals were beautiful and worth checking out. Waves looked much calmer than Haeundae, so might be better for swimming. Overall not bad."
Interesting beach to visit,"We visited this beach during the week, so there were not many people on the beach- this was great. Some interesting sculptures in the water and a beautiful walkway out into the ocean make it a worthwhile stop on your visit to Busan. Try the fried chicken at Mom’s Touch on the beachfront! "
Cool place to stop by,"The beach has a story about a prince, a turtle and a mermaid. There are statutes of them and the bridge is very long way to walk. The view is lovely with mountain and lighthouse. It's near Gamcheon village so you can come here by taxi after the village."
More attractive than Haeundae Beach,"It is sobering that in the 1980s, Typhoon Thelma wiped out the beach sands at Songdo Beach. Twenty plus years later, the beach has a reasonable amount of sand even if hardly up to Philippines white sand standards.We travelled by bus from Nampo metro station, taking 13 minutes on a route 7 bus.The beach had temporary showers nicely done, It was an easy 10 minute walk to the cable car and there was a biardwalk highlighting local rock pools."
"A beach day might be more fun, than stopping by the skywalk..... we could have #kipped this stop on the t","A beach day might be more fun, than stopping by to walk the skywalk..... did not do the sky tram, and it looked pretty short, but might be nice over the ocean. We could have skipped this stop on the tour"
Breathtaking view,"The skywalk was nice experience, breathtaking view and relaxing place. However didnt go by beach side so can't comment on that. "
An interesting walk over the sea,"On a beautiful day the Skywalk was a lovely thing to do. It’s a bit like a winding pier, above the sea, below the glass bottomed cable cars, with a glass panel along the centre and wonderful views. About two thirds of the way along there was a short tunnel leading to rocks, piled atop each other and forming a base for two statues, one a dragon mermaid, and also a large tortoise emerging from a broken eggshell. The Skywalk was very tastefully done but not quite as long as we’d envisaged."
Just another beach.,Nothing special.Just somewhere for the kids to run around.The cable car runs to and from and plenty of food places to eat.
Nice place to visit,"The beach is great and clean. When we visited, the weather was just nice and walking on Songdo skywalk was extremely great. You may take cable car there but we did not. It was not crowded and is a quiet, windy and relaxing place indeed."
HOW TO ROCK OUT AT SONG-D0,"The beach is great. many find it to be the best city beach in Busan. You can also jump off of two diving boards, walk on a biride, or even take a cable car across the ocean!! You can hike here, too!!"
Summer Breeze in Songdo,I went here for Songdo Skywalk. It was really nice. But it's kinda tricky to find the beach because i had to walk along the alley to find the beach.
The first 'official' beach in Busan.,"The first official beach in Busan, Songdo was opened by the Japanese in 1913. In the 2000's it underwent a facelift but still remains the blandest of Busan's beaches. The Songdo Beach Cablecar draws the crowds - but detracts from, rather than enhances the view."
Cable Car Area,This is the area and beach for the cable that you will see from a number of angles when close to the waterfront of BusanA busy bustling area and accessible by taxi or by foot 
Great free activity in Busan,I really enjoyed this sky walk over the ocean and surrounding beach area. What a beautiful piece of architecture. The park across the street is also gorgeous.
You can view a light house here,"It is another beach in Busan, it has a light house. It is next to many other attractions in Busan. So just visit this place once when you are in Busan."
Nice walk from Amnam Park,"This is a man made beach, close to the Cable Car station. Songdo Cloud Trails and Songdo Waterfalls make this an interesting walk."
"Stunning, so pretty and just a small walk.","This area is so pretty, walk along the sky walks and catch the cable car to the othe rside and back. It's SO blue you will get amazing photos. Take a drink if you go in August....OMG, it was HOT"
Cool Beach,"I had a good time riding the cable car here. It has great views of the city, and good seafood restaurants nearby"
Songdo skywalk in Busan,"I traveled to Busan with my sister in March.The weather is not too cold.We went to many places but I think this places is very interesting because the view is beautiful. There is a mirror bridge and the wind blows. When I walk feel relaxed because it is quiet and it was not that crowded.There are delicious food it like hamburger. There are Korean sugar candy. Most couples will come and eat Korean sugar candy together. Who want to feel relax,you should come to this place."
Cloud walk was nothing special ,"We visited as we wanted to check out the Songdo Skywalk. It was quite overcast when we went and the skywalk itself was quite underwhelming. It was a nice walk with some viewpoints but nothing special in the end. In terms of visiting for the beach it's quite small compared to Haeundae. Visit if in the area, but wouldn't recommend a trip out of the way to see it. "
Nothing special,"This beach is next to Songjeong beach. It was like if you have been to one you have been to the other. It was a very afternoon when we were there, we only passed it since we already visited its neighbour. I have seen better beaches."
Less touristic than Haundae,"Songdo beach is more popular to residents than other touristic beaches of Busan such as Haundae or Gwanganli. If you prefer a comparatively quiet beach, Songdo or Dadaepo is recommended in Busan.- There are many groups of families.- The trail along the cliff starting from Songdo Beach is good to walk. There are some nice place on rocks to rest or get fishing.- Martime Cable Car above sea is available."
Beautiful beach,"Close to busan but cab it. Lovely beach with cable car and walk along beach front.Rests. quite expensive given other beaches, gwangalli. Worth a visit."
Nice beach with skywalk over ocean and air cruise to Amnam Park,"Nice beach area with a neat walkway that goes out over the ocean called the Songdo Beach Skywalk. There is also the Busan Air Cruise at the station inside across from the walkway. You can walk along the beach to the city and even along the cliffs on the ocean to the Amnam Park station. There are various interesting structures in the ocean and make for good photo opportunities. To walk from the station all the way around the beach up to Amnam Park and the sky cruise station there, It is quite a walk at least a couple hours. Otherwise you can take the Busan Air Cruise cable car ride to Amnam Park. Either way, enjoy!"
A hideout beach for locals,"It's a good location for a beach walk and seafood lunch. There is a foot bridge with fncy design that attracts a lot of tourists. You may spend one hour or less walking along the bridge and then move to the restaurant area to find local seafood. However, our experience was that the seadood are excellent but no rice or noodles are provided, so much so that you may need to fill your calories need elsewhere."
Nice area and Cable Car,"We decided to catch a local bus so we could do the sky walk and cable car. Enjoyed the skywalk and able to get some nice photos. We then went across the bay on the Cable Car which was a nice ride. We walked down the hill to see the fishermen and the cliff walk.If you like walking and some good photo shots, you have the option of one way on the cable car and then do the walk back, or visa versa. If we hadn’t purchased a return ticket then we would have walked back. We arrived at the Cable Car at 9.30 on a Friday with no lines at all, we did notice a few buses arriving when we returned."
Beautiful beach,Loved the beach and the walkway. Crystal clear waters with abundant sea vegetation. There were buskers which made the atmosphere festive. 
The cable car glass floor is scary,"We went in the cable car - with the glass floor - for the full experience. The views out the windows along the coast are outstanding! The view through the glass floor is scary and takes some getting used to. The instructions tell you to remain seated and not stand up on the glass floor. If you are scared of heights, go in the metal floor cable car. There is a park with a forest at the other end. Well worth a visit."
Songdo Beach walk around,We visited this place in 2014. The day we came the beach was empty so we just walked around before our bus came. I enjoyed the brief solitude while walking around. 
See thru bridge,"The area was very clean and the beach was very nice. A lot of seashells. The pier/bridge was pretty amazing. You can see through a metal grate along the center of Songdo skywalk. The ""jack"" shaped cement pieces were pretty cool, however I need to figure out where they came from. "
Beautiful viewwwww ,"Take a stroll at the glass panel floor/bridge. Breathtaking views. Put on warmer clothing if you are visiting in winter, and also come earlier before 5pm as Sun sets earlier in winter. Perfect spot for sunset/sunrise."
Nice beach,An interesting beach that gives the appearance being a city beach with its view of the bridge. I can imagine it getting very crowded here during the good weather.
"Just another beach, but with a cable car feature......","This is just another of the many beaches in Busan. Basically all are quite similar except in size & some features.We came in late morning & it was very hot with the burning sun beating down hard. But the cool breeze helps. Put sunblock or you may get bad sunburn.The view as you walk along the skywalk is nice though. From the skywalk, you can see the cable car moving above ( Busan Air Cruise).Really, it's quite a long journey to come here just for the beach. It is not worth coming all the way here, but adding the Busan Air Cruise to the trip does make it a little more worthwhile."
"Go on the skybridge, beware of the crowd!","Went here for the skybridge, and it was awesome! You dont have to pay anything, but the crowd is certainly heavy. Take your time strolling the bridge."
Pleasant beach,"This beach was a little quieter than Haeundae Beach, but it's also smaller. We went in October, so we didn't swim, but just enjoyed the sand and people playing. The suspended board walk is nice and cable car was worth the 15,000 won. We just paid the regular fare rather than paying for the glass floor cars, and we're glad we did. The line up for the ""Crystal Floor"" was so much longer, but you can't tell till after you pay."
Not worth it AT ALL!! ,"I went there hoping to spend a good day, turned to be the worst day of my entire Korea's trip. I went there by bus then continued by taxi. The taxi dropped us off at the sky walk. The sky walk was fine, but short in distance. So if you are not near that area, then don't bother. We decided to book tickets for the cable cars which are called now ""Busan Air Cruise"". It's really REALLY REALLY crowded!!! TOO CROWDED!! But we booked anyway since we already reached the destination. We waited in a line for more than 25 mins, then road the cable car. Guess what??? It was only 8 mins!!!! The whole waiting was for a boring-above-the-sky ride!!! Then when we reached the opposite destination, we had to drop-off and wait in line AGAIN!!! Whole boring scenario is repeated!! Worst experience ever, not worth it at all!! Even the boat ride was too expensive. I DON'T RECOMMEND AT ALL. "
Breathtaking View from Cable Car and Mountain Top,The Songdo Beach area is very nice and clean. There is a lot of shopping and restaurants across the road from the beach.The view from the cable car (Busan Air Cruise) and Mountain Top landing area was beautiful at night.
Loved this bridge ,"Thanks to the city tour we were lucky enough to visit this beach. It is so beautiful and distinct from Haeundae and Geangalli, there was a bridge and sky road. Plenty of restaurants and calm and clean sea. Though, there were a lot of people and we couldn't find a parking spot. But I would definitely recommend this beach to explore. Set aside enough time for spending here because there are lots of activities to do))) "
The reopen cable car is very foreigners unfriendly ,"Heard about the reopening of the Songdo marina cable car. It's called Busan Air Cruise now. So want to give it a try. Went to ticketing and found out it is very foreigner unfriendly. The staffs do not understand English. One of the female staff didn't even talked to me and just stuffed me with a pamphlet instead. I was sent to a ticketing machine since I said I'll pay by credit card. The machine is Korean only. My daughter had to use Google translate in order to understand how to use the machine. So if you can't read Korean, I suggest you to wait in the incredibly long line for the sales window. Also with using the machine you wouldn't know of the wait time for the car. We found out there's an over 2 hours wait for the crystal car at the boarding line. Too late already, we already purchased the tickets. Ended up having to wait. "
Songdo,"Had to take a taxi from Jagalchi Station. Still a nice beach. Didn't had time for the skywalk :( good to relax. Doesn't have bars around like Gwangalli or Haeundae, more like a low key place"
there is a songdo walkway in the beach,lots of residents here or localsno one is wearing 2 piece bikini herego to walkway nearby with small cave
A good view on a good day. ,"The last part of the skywalk is not wheelchair friendly and so I went about 3 quarter way. Nevertheless, it's still has the nice view that was expected. "
Beautiful Beach and Skywalk adventure,"If you want to have a great experience in Busan, try going to Songdo Skywalk. We initially wanted to check Oryukdo but we were told that the skywalk is just short, so we opted to check Songdo Beach instead. Best time to go there is before sunset where you can have a good view of the golden sunset."
"Walk the beach, then the skybridge","We came here via the city tour - Mandi bus. There are two stops - one for the beach and the other for the walkway. Free to the public.In the summer we can imagine how crowded the sand beach is, and with the platforms offshore, many people could be diving into the sea for a swim! Just adjacent is the skywalk over the sea connected to the Amnam park.It is in two sections, the first part which runs from the beach to the entrance to Amnam park, the 2nd part which is from the park that juts into the open water facing the bay. At this end there is a scenic view of the bay."
Beautiful skywalk at Songdo Beach,"Very nice place, the 365 meter long skywalk is amazing. It was Sunday and very crowded there. Come and take a walk on the sea, to see the beautiful scenery or you may spend a day and relax on the beach too,"
Clean and quiet Beach,"Probably it is quiet since I went there on Chuseok Day. It is a nice, simple, clean, and quite beach. The waves doesn't seem big. There was a platform there, where Song Il Kook, the triplets father form the superman return, once jumped there and was shoot in the variety show. There are some seafood restaurant and cafes near by."
Nice and clean,"The beach looks actually very similar to haeundae, but the waves are not as big and there is less going on. I mean not only less people but also less restaurants and shops. But if you like surfing, you rent a surfing board here...at least i saw a surfing club, so i guess they rent it out.The beach is well suited for swimming and you can also come with smaller kids."
Good swimming beach,"There are diving platforms and fun things to do in the water.The beach is small and a bit out of the way, so it remains tucked away from the hoardes. The new skywalk is lovely as is the fountain. There is hiking/walking/fishing as well as swimming and sunbathing available. "
Night walks,We stayed near this beach as to avoid loud night life at Haeundae. Which is not a regret. Bought ramen and have it hot by the beach. Which is a great experience for us. Have a night walk on the nearby bridge.
Not clean beach,"If you wanna enjoy the fresh air with pristine water and golden beach, I highly recommend you not to come here. The beach is definitely not as clean as Haeundae >.<The most outstanding point is the Cloud Trails nearby."
"Nice beach, but tough to compete with Gwangalli and Haeundae","Songdo Beach is a nice beach, and many cities would be envious of having such a large and beautiful beach, but in Busan, it's just ""one of many"". If you stay in Busan for more than a couple of days, it's good to visit Songdo, but I think Haeundaeu and Gwangalli have more appeal. Songdo is just not as big as the others, and doesn't feel as lively. The shops and restaurants behind the beach do not feel as bustling as elsewhere. But that might be about to change. By March 2017 a new cable car will open in Songdo beach, and additional real estate developments should make it even more worthwhile to go there in the future."
nice walking tracs next to the beach,"It is less busy than the other beaches and walkable in an hour from Pusan Centre, or take the bus. Big whale in the water for funny pics. Next to the beach there you can do a walking Track, not spectaculair but with some nice views and good for getting a little active."
Lovely beach,"A great location , nice view beach is clean, cool and calm environment a good attraction downtown can stopby to take photo at sky walk bridge. A fresh seafood restaurant nearby ."
Can't forget this place,Broke my foot here while playing football on the beach(although the place has nothing to do with it). Also played volleyball. One of the best beaches I have been to.
"Easy to go, swimming","You can go by Bus No.96, or walk in subway station combine between Jagalchi station and Songdo station. Have sky walk above the sea. "
Less touristy than Haeundae and Gwangan,Great beach to relax and get away from more touristy crowds. Access to get fresh seafood from local restaurants. 
Peaceful,"A much better choice if you want to avoid the crowds in Haeundae. During the night, there is a dancing fountain show. There is also a viewing deck which is scary as all eff to walk on but it was really cool to just and out and look at the tides."
Very pleasant day,"Walked along the coastal walkway to Songdo beach and had a delicious lunch at a cold buckwheat noodle shop opposite the beach.Further along the road had coffee in a cute cafe on the 3rd level with great views.A lovely quiet place with a number of eating places,beach is very clean and nice for a swim."
Serene beach,A calm and quiet beach with limited activity. It has local cuisines.it is mainly catered to local people although the tourist bus has a stop here. It is good if you want to stroll on sea beach in a quiet atmosphere.
Mackerel festival,"We had a memorable experience participating in the mackerel festival. My kids and husband each caught a mackerel with bare hands, then they cleaned and salted it so that we could grill it over charcoal and devoured it right on the beach. Delicious!"
nice beach calmer than Haeundae,its close to a temple at the seaside. It is a nice walk from the temple to the sea. There are lots of surfers
quiet beach with authentic feel due to primarily locals,Cosy....non crowded....many places to eat local cuisine ....mainly seafood.....pleasant promenade along the water with benches ......people watching .....broad beach with clean sand and clear waters.......
nice view....but average,"the sea water not very clear, the sand is rough, not suitable for play around, but there have some water sport."
Short beach walk,"Songdo beach is a stop on the Busan city bus tour, Taejongdae Loop. There were no particular reason for getting off the bus, we just wanted to stretch out our legs and walk along the beach. There were lots of cafés unfortunately we didn't stop at any of them. The bus stops every 20-30 minutes and it only stops at one place on this beach. The beach is clean and there are diving flat form on the water if you decide to take a dip. "
New Years,It was very cold. I am not much of a beach goer but it was a good experience of fireworks and music to bring in the new year.
Lovely,lovely beach. Peaceful and nice scenery. Would love to go back there again.Lots of cafe around the front of the beach
Good view with nice cooling weather,People are fishing fishing during the cold weather. Not to crowded and water is clean and clear. Nice place for a walk and photo taking. Not too crowded too.
"In fact, better beach than Haeundae",Usually not as crowded as Haeundae and of course water is clearer. So many seafood restaurants along the beach but more pricey and upscale than Haeundae Beach.
"Nice, but not much to do","The beach was nice enough, with some interesting statues in the water. We were there earlier in the day, however, and there was exactly one chain coffee shop open. Worth a visit, but we ended up moving on quickly."
Exciting Songdo Beach,"I live here, sorta. Have an apartment that overlooks the beach. Not as crowded and busy as Haeundae Beach, but has all the features, accommodations, eating, water front coffee, beach activities and vendors; lots of special events."
One of the only uncrowded beaches,"If you're looking to not be surrounded by people at the beach, head to Songdo. There's never many people here and plenty of places to grab a coffee or lunch. Take bus 30 from Nampo subway station for about 15 minutes."
Hidden Gem of Busan,"A little far to travel, but this is the beach that locals love. Lots of great multi-level coffee shops with incredible views. "
Hidden gems at nearby fish village,"Came here for Sea Art Festival, via complimentary shuttle van from Nampo-dong. Lots of sculptures with history explanation, very informative. There are some hiking trails further down the road, so my family and I took the easier 40 mins pace which leads to a fishing village. You can see some local fisher-ladies in full body diving suit hunting for clams and sea critters. AMAZING! For those gastronomic adventurers, there are tent areas where they sell snacks and live (squirmy) seafood meal range from 20,000 - 40,000 won, depending on the portion. Black clams are given as 'service' aka free!!! Lovely!"
Fake dolphins and whales,"Came here after a hike and it was a great end. Not many people in March but I'm sure there are more later in the year. There are statues of whale tales and dolphins in the water, and I think that's as far as you're allowed to swim out."
Songdo to Amnan Park coastal walkway,"I lived in Busan for almost a year. Places like Taejongdae are beautiful and must be visited as well as all the beaches. This however was my personal favorite place to be in Busan. You can walk the road from Songdo Beach to Amnan Park, which is what I did. I then walked along the metal/coral colored walkway from the park and back to Songdo Beach. You can see for miles, and during the week it isn't so populated. You're right next to the water and can see all the boats and barges. From Jagalchi, it only takes about 10 minutes to get to Songdo Beach on the bus. "
Good place,I went there when there was a hiphop festival. It was pretty fun and the night view was also beautiful. 
Enjoyed,We enjoyed this beach (less crowded when compared to Haeundae or Gwangalli beaches). There are a lot of Korean restaurants and some chiken & beer restaurants nearby. Definitely a place worth visiting in Busan.
