don't go unless there is a game on,It is a pity as there was no game on due to the world cup but we walked round the stadium and you could see the pitch from outside. There are quite a few sculptures in the vicinity of the stadium that are interesting. Apparently there is a world cup museum but we did not have time to look for it.
Great place for football.,"I am currently staying in Suwon, and I decided to catch a game tonight. Great venue. Friendly staff who spoke good English. Food and drink was adequate and good. Very convenient and easy to get to. Atmosphere and crowd wonderful. Tickets nicely priced. No complaints ! A very good night out !"
"Great day trip from Seoul, but bring tissues just in case","Caught a football match here recently. At the gate, the cheapest tickets were 14,000 KRW (approx. 14 USD), but since there were lots of empty seats, it was easy enough to manage an ""upgrade"" once inside. The Suwon Bluewings are an entertaining team to watch (they played well in the one game we saw anyway) and their hard-core supporters do not stop chanting and singing. One can only imagine the atmosphere they'd produce in a high-stakes game with a larger turnout.One of the 2002 World Cup venues, the Suwon stadium is well-maintained and has good snack options (the chimaek is tasty). Would have been five stars but for my experience with the ladies' room. While clean, none of the stalls I tried had any toilet paper left (if they had any to begin with). So grab some paper towels by the sink or bring your own tissues just in case!If you are coming here from Seoul, the most straightforward way is via taxi (ask a local to write down the destination and address in Korean for the driver). The ride took about an hour and cost between 40,000 and 50,000 KRW each way. Taking the 1 subway line all the way to Hwaseo or Suwon is a cheaper option, but note that from the train station you'll still need to catch a taxi or bus to reach the stadium."
Game,"Saw a soccer game between the local suwon football team vs another in the same tier & the whole stadium was really well kept. Great accessibility, shops & large availability of food & drinks.Transport to the stadium with subway or bus from Seoul was also really easy so that made for a high mark aswell. "
Suwon World Cup Stadium - Korea's Pride,"I visited the Suwon World Cup Stadium sometime in Sep'17. I had a flight to catch in few hours and i decided to make the most of the available time in hand. I arrived at the stadium and found that it was closed!! I realized that there was no game on currently and so the stadium was closed. It was a bit of a disappointment (Hold on , there is a happy ending to this story :-))So, I spent the next 30 minutes walking around the stadium, taking pictures of the exterior and through whatever opening i could find of the pitch and the spectator's gallery. At the end of my walk, I came down and reached the museum at the stadium and found it was locked. There was a lady at the museum reception and i asked her if the museum was locked as well. She replied that the museum was closed for lunch and would open in an hour.I casually told her that I was from India and i had hoped to catch a glimpse of the stadium, but could not wait as i had to catch a flight in few hours. She thought for a moment and told me ""Wait!"" and spoke to someone in Korean and I guess explained my situation. Someone came over within minutes and she told me ""I take you to stadium""!!I could not believe it! I had a personal tour of the stadium (Look at the pictures!!), I was able to walk along the sidelines and see the stadium, all on my own!! Of course the lady was watching me and instructed me not to step on the pitch :-)The stadium is well maintained. It is also the home ground of the Samsung Football team.I spent about 10 minutes inside and then she opened the museum for me. I took a quick look around, took a lot of pictures, and thanked her for the hospitality."
Plan to visit stadium when we have a Football game,"Suwon is the city who has a Samsung football team. In this world cup stadium, you may have a world class facilities with fun. This wolrd cup stadium has several restaurants including golf practice range, swimming pool, health gym. within 30 min distance, you also can find out baseball stadium as well."
Good Stadium,"Were here last week to watch World Cup U-20 match! It has good facilities, clean restroom, and even when you watch from the high-end seat the view is still amazing. The stadium also located in the center of Suwon with almost 24 hours transportation available. Outside the stadium, there is a track perfect for morning jogging."
Venue for the World Cup Korea - Japan 2002.,"I first went to this stadium in 2002 for the World Cup, so everything was brand spanking new. Although subsequent visits were nearby, I did not go inside to see how it aged. Pristine clean, safe, and modern, it has all the things you would expect in a stadium of this category. For those of you who have never been to Korea, MasterCard and Visa (and Amex) are NOT the predominant credit cards used there. There are few places to get cash, and from what I remember there was only a couple installed at the stadium for these cards. Korea has their ""own"". "
Very good stadium,Stadiums in South Korea are generally good. They have good facilities and well maintained. Very good place to hangout with friends. 
Visiting ,Here now its been 12 years this was a part of the world cup stadiums..its been looked sfter snd maintained very well. 
Good stadium,"Above average in both size and ammeneties. Not much to say does the job quite well! Like the outsidecof the stadium as well! After all it was made to host the world cup, even though it has been 13 years it's still great."
Good venue,"Easily-accessible stadium, quick and easy ticketing procedure and a great atmosphere to watch local games."
Clean and large,"What more can I say...I have been both inside the stadium for watching games and outside the stadium for exercise. Every time the grounds are clean and facilities are kept in top condition. The outer ring around the stadium offers exercise equipment, art and the ability to hire sports equipment and electronic ride on toy cats for kids. A great visit for either a game or sightseeing. "
to watch the match between Suwon FC and Seoul,Good stadium with nice facilities. It's connectivity is good from Suwon metro station. One can get a direct bus from multiple locations near Suwon.
Nice to walk and exercise at free time,"I like jogging around suwon worldcup stadium. The track is pretty nice and sometimes people are riding bicycles. In spring or fall, it is good to exercise with workout equipment in stadium area.the stadium condition is also one of the best stadiums in korea. "
Revival Brazilian win,"In the Fifa World Cup 2002, Brazil visited this stadium, matched Costa Rica and win. I just watch by TV, but be in the stadium is awesome."
Worth a watch,"I went for the Suwon vs Ulsan game. Though the stadium was only half full, the atmosphere was pretty amazing with some very catchy Korean chants. Could have been much better with full attendance."
Why is it not full!,This experience overall was great. Koreans deffinitely have tonssss of energy. They will never leave the stadium or lower down their energy even if losing. I really enjoyed watching that. I was very dissapointed in the lack of crowd. If you do want to see all the seats filled--watch their baseball games :). After the game or before walking around the stadium is pretty nice. They have some statue on display. 
Good,Good place This stadium is fantasticThere is FCSuwon Samsung's home ground
