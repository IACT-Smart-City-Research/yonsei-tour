University Tour,"Yonsei University is considered the one of the most prestigious South Korean university. Sinchon Campus where all K-Dramas are filmed is the main campus. Underwood Hall, is covered with vines/plants that turns reddish during autumn.Getting here:Sinchon Station [신촌역], Seoul Subway Line 2, Exit 218 mins walk to the 3 most popular Gothic-style buildings (side-by-side) in the university ground.It has one of the most beautiful campuses in Seoul."
Yonsei,"Right next to Sinchon towards North. Noce university, good location. Good for taking some pictures.."
Cafes and shops,"This is a lively area with restaurants, shops and cafes. Live music performances can be seen on the weekends. Late night activities such as karaoke or norebang are plentiful. Word of caution: try not to stay beyond last subway train home. It can be difficult to flag down a taxi at 2 am in this area. "
Nice university,It's a very modern university with a lot of buildings with different architecture. We had the opportunity to visit the new constructions that they were building at the time we were there.
