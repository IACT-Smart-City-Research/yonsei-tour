Hikers gonna hike,I can't believe the stamina of Koreans...I'm loving this hiking hobby. You're gonna hike for more than an hour or two so wear proper attire. 
Great hike while enjoying an historical site,This was a lovely easy-moderate hike with great city and mountain views. It is a beautiful setting and worth the trip out of Seoul to see.
Nice hike w great views on Seoul,"Went there yesterday w our boys. Nice views of Seoul. Easy to hike. Best to arrive as early as possible, as parking can be difficult on holidays or weekends.The palace is nice too, but there much more exiting ones to visit"
Quiet walking close to Seoul.,"A lovely quiet place to walk through woodland with some beautiful traditional Korean building. To get there we took line 8 to Sanseong station came out of exit 2, about 20 meters down the road is the bus stop, we took bus 9 up to the park. The park is the last stop and most people get off there. We got off a little sooner to walk up through the wood. Once you are close there are many paths up. The area is quit large and you can take a gentle stroll along the wal or zigzag up and down to get some more hills in. There are lots of signs and you can pick a map up close from one of the huts close to the bus station. The maps did not appear to be internally accurate or to scale, some of the maked paths are smaller than they appear and some large paths are not on it, but it will give you a reasonable idea. There are quite a few little temples and shrines doted about as well as the fourt and the palace. The main reason to come is the walking as the buildings are no more impressive than those found closer to the centre. It is quieter than the more well know walks this close to the city."
A hiding place,"This was actually something I took from tripadvisor thinking it was close to the city, we took a taxi from Itaewon after we went for breakfast there. Taxi did not speak any english so I was glad that I added the name of this place in Korean so he put it on his GPA, this taxi guy did not know where this place was located in fact most people in Seoul do not know about this fortress is actually about an hour away from the city of Seoul but once you get there is a little town and you find the trail to start hiking. You see lots of local and elderly people hiking up, it is a beautiful place with beautiful areas lots of trees and you can actually hike all the way to the end, but sadly we did not had much time to do so since the taxi guy was nice enough to wait for us. So I guess that by doing a personal tour or even renting a car you can come here, I truly recommended."
"A great nature walk ""along the wall"" :)","Famed for its ""encircling wall"" which is really a ""fairly short"" wall (at 5-foot-6 my head was either at par with or just slightly below the ""roof part"" of the wall in some places but was clearly above the wall in some other places; in any case you can be sure if you're of an average height that you'll have a ""clear view"" over the wall pretty much all the way as you walk along the path alongside the wall), I walked around this ""mountain fortress"" from the North Gate to the West Gate to the South Gate taking in the ""very peaceful"" nature scenery of mountains & forests over the wall on one side (on the other side of the path is also a wooded area throughout); and besides taking in the nature scenery along the path, the gates themselves are also ""good sights"" especially the South Gate (the ""most popular"" gate back in the day when this was a functioning fortress as I learned from the signs) which can be gone up and where there's a little park just outside the gate, and there's also the West Command Post just a little inside from the main path (about a 10-minute walk from the West Gate if you're going toward the South Gate) which is a ""fairly sizeable"" building supported by pillars all around on a stone platform with an associated ""sad history"" that the commander of the post was falsely accused & executed despite a raven appearing to vouch for his innocence (as he said it would!). Also, as you approach the West Gate from the direction of the North Gate (about a 20-minute walk between the two gates), the main path ""forks"" into a secondary high-ground path just about 5 minutes before getting to the West Gate, and I suggest going up that path (can also go up from the other end when you get to the West Gate) for ""quite a breathtaking"" view of the city below with its plenty of high-rises (likely the southern outskirts of Seoul as that is where this mountain is).And yes, apart from the walk along the wall, there's the so-called Emergency Palace (so named because it was where the Joseon kings fled to in times of invasion by Chinese & Manchu back in the day) which is ""considerably compact"" compared to the palaces in the city on their huge expansive grounds, but I figured they reasoned this was just a ""temporary palace"" for times of crisis so it didn't need to be a big palace; it's quite conveniently located near the rotary (roundabout) area where if you come up the mountain by bus is where you get off and from which it's also just about a 10-minute walk to the North Gate, so you have an option either to go into the Palace first (ticket required from the little ""hut office"" near the roundabout where they also have tourist maps of the area available free of charge) or do the walk first starting at the North Gate. And what I suggest if you only have a limited amount of time (if you don't plan to spend like ""the whole day"" here) is to ""turn left"" when you get to the North Gate and make it to the South Gate via the West Gate for a little less than an hour in total, then take the ""shortcut path"" which goes through the woods back to the rotary area and which to my surprise took only like 15 minutes in total all the way from the South Gate to the entrance of Emergency Palace! On the other hand, if you want to continue from the South Gate to the East Gate, the main path alongside the wall seems to have a ""break"" when you get to the South Gate although I'm sure it resumes at some point to continue on to the East Gate (which I didn't get to since I took that shortcut path through the woods as mentioned above to get back to the rotary area).Coming by subway, Sanseong Station (on Line 8) is where to get off followed by a bus ride that takes about half an hour to the rotary area where you get off (as mentioned above) & where there are also places for food (I had a ""pretty good"" sandwich breakfast at the GS25 store with some tables & chairs to sit down and eat at the back of the store)."
Great Trail Running in a huge city!,"We were visiting Asia to run an ultra marathon in Nepal. We spent a few days on a layover in Seoul and needed to get in a 2 1/2 hour run. We found a link from a website that recommend this park. It is a beautiful park with 157km of trails in the middle of a huge city. It took an hour via subway to get there but was well worth the effort. The trail we took was a pretty good climb (about 3000 feet over a 2 1/2 hour run). To find the website about running, just google ""Seoul trail running"". There are several suggestions for running. We chose the run titled ""Seoul Trail â€“ Starting from Suseo Station: 10-14 km Moderate"". You'll also get some great views of the city."
The huge fortress in the picturesque mountains.,"Namhansansung means Fortress on the mountain Namhansan. This fortress included by UNESCO in the list of World Heritage in 2014. Of course, this fact has affected the number of western tourists. Though I can`t say it was too much. This place is popular mostly among Korean people. The trip here from Seoul requires a half of day minimum. You should use subway (line 8) to get to the station Sanseong (prior to Namhansanseong). After it needs to use bus 9 or 52. The bus will go to the mountain. It doesn`t need to pay smth for the park but the visit to Emergency palace costs 2500 KRW. It takes 30-40 min. But the inspection of the park requires a remarkable physical abilitues. It`s about 55-60 km around the perimeter. I doubt that most of tourists will be able to do it, But I saw a lean Korean seniors and something told me they went around... As for us we just climbed to the Norht gate (Bugmun gate) and climbed a little more to the Site of North command post and after that turned back. Seoul waits us."
Fortified Forest,"Very pretty spot nestled in the mountains with diverse sites and lots of history. Generally easy to moderate walking with restaurants sprinkled throughout the entry area for breaks as needed. Crowds were minimal on a weekday mid-morning and allowed for great solo exploration. Easy to access from the Sanseong or Namhamsanseong metro stations - it is the last stop on a couple of local buses, primarily #9, which allows for pretty views on the drive up."
A Great Way To Spend A Sunday Afternoon,"We use to live in Hanam City - and if you do too - then there's no excuse not to visit this great little attraction! It is about 1.5-2 hours walk out of the city centre. Simply follow the rivers upstream (walking South away from the Han) and then when the rivers disappear walk up the mountain, once you get round to the other side you will be at Namhansanseong! I wouldn't say there is an abundance to see but the fortress is pretty and as well kept as similar attractions around Seoul and its satellite cities. You get good views over Jamsil and the Lotte Tower being built there and there's almost always someone selling delicious Korean food or ice creams from a cool box! It's a great way to spend a Sunday afternoon in late summer, that's for sure."
"Amazing scenery, great walk","The Namhansansung Fortress is a must-see, it's great for many reasons. It's definitely great for hikers, great for those who love history and old buildings, with its splendid gates and walls (and the complex at the center of the complex as well). It's also amazing for those who want to gaze at the city as it allows for wonderful panoramas of Southeast Seoul. And the fortress also offers a wide selection of coffee shops and small restaurants, which are the great to take a break from all the walking. Definitely one of the top attractions in or near Seoul, although its fairly remote location might rebuke some tourists..."
Good hike!,Great place for a hike (except maybe in mid summer)...takes about 3-4 hours to walk around the entire fortress...center of the park has some sights like the temporary palace and the arsenal along with a good selection of restaurants...great place to spend a day if you want a good hike...
Beautiful Fortress,We went strictly to see the fortress & wall. We walked to the North Gate and walked along the wall. Reminded us of The Great Wall of China! Was really beautiful. And its an easy walk the way we went. On a clear day the views from the wall are amazing since its built up on a hill. There are information panels here and there. The history of the fortress is interesting. We had to pay a small fee to park our car but not for the fortress itself. There are a few restaurants around to eat. visited: April 2014
Mountain Fortress,"I enjoyed this fortress. We drove down from Seoul and parked at what I would call the base of trails to the south gate. This is the main gate used by the king. It looked like there was parking closer to the gate. We then hiked up. We took a trail that lead us to a temple to the right and up to the western ridge. The trail was steep, but maintained to the temple. After the temple it became a rugged hiking trail. At the top, of the ridge, we could take a well maintained trail or more of a hiking trail that lead to outside of western fortification and wall back to the South Gate. We took the more hiking path that lead along the outside of the wall and it was a pleasant hike. At the South Gate, there was a little snack area just down the hill. We then hiked up the well maintained trail to the command post and followed the wall back. The well maintained trails at this park are stroller friendly while the others like along the wall are hiking trails. Expect up and down segments particularly along walls as it is in the mountains. The area by the second command post had great views back toward Seoul and the Lotte tower, so if possible plan your trip on clear days. There were many things to see such as the palace within the walls down in the valley that we didn't get to. I think this fortress is a contrast to Suwon. Suwon is in the city and various structures/defenses along the wall with other trappings. Namhansansung is in the mountains and more simplistic likely as the steep mountains negate the need for many defensive structures or maybe to difficult to build. The walls and views in the mountains created some great views. There was a parking fee to use the parking lot."
Nothing much,"I believe people intending to hike to and visit this place during a milder climate would be in for a treat, but it felt quite pointless visiting this place during winter since you only get to see the gate and walls."
See Suwon Fortress instead,"Namhansansung fortress is located in Gyeonggido provinve between Seongnam and Hanam cities. Getting there by puiblic transport is a bit tricky and takes well over 1 hour from Seoul center by public transport.The fortress was completed in the 18th century, around the same time as Suwon fortress, and consequently it is very similar in design as Suwon fortress although on a larger scale. Walking around the entire wall takes about 5 hours over very hilly terrain.It can be a pleasant hike with the occassional towers and temples, it can be disappointing as a historic site. If you have been to the Suwon fortress, you will not see anything dramatically new. Although there are many restaurants and shops near the main car park, there are very few facilities along the wall.In conclusion, it's a good hike but disappointing historic site."
Good to walk,Wonderful nature.Recoded on Unesco world treasure.best time is ealry in the morning
Nice Walk,"Namhansansung is a park preserving old gates and a wall that line the mountain. It's a pretty easy hike (or walk if you will) and there are lots of different routes you can take. There are some pretty cool high up views, but they don't show much but wide expanses of Korean apartments and villages. If you want to go take a walk for a few hours and see some cool old gates and walls then head out there. We took the subway to Namhansansung station on line 8 then picked up the local #9 bus from there to the park."
nice hike on paved walks or stairs,Our relatives took us on a nice hike to the Namansansung Park on a rainy Sunday. Their were a lot a people even on a rainy day so that I can imagine the crowds on a sunny holiday. Be prepared for a strenuous hike with stairs. The hike down is on a wide paved road so that it is much easier to come down. We has a nice lunch at one of the local restaurants with mokkolli and san namul (mountain vegetables).
"Good 1 day trip, not for the faint hearted","Namhansanseong, a mountain fortress in Gwangju (not the one at Jeolla) just outside of Seoul is a good place for. 1 day hike and a unique view of a mountain fortress/ royal refuge, as this was the place where King Injo sought refuge in during the Manchu Invasions, though he has to surrender after 47 days due to a lack of supplies. Currently it is a candidate for UNESCO in 2014( which t fully deserved, and should be conferred upon.) Namhansanseong is fairly easily accessible. One could alight at sanseong subway station and take city bus no 9 to the entrance, or could also alight at namhansanseong station and walk to the outskirts (foothills) of the mountain fortress (quite a walk). The hike up is tiring (400+ m I think), but worth it as the views up at the fortress was simply breathtaking. Halfway up the hike, there are also springs where hikers could take a sip of water from.However, up at the fortress, it is mostly mountainous and signboard showing the map of the entire place is fairly few in between. Some signs indicating location at various points are only available in Korean, so 1 might have some problems in telling where to go if he or she doesn't understand Korean. Brochures of the map is found at the palace in namhansanseong, in front of the office.Come equipped with suitable hiking shoes and ample supples of water would do fine(I wore sneakers up, wasn't much suitable or the sometimes muddy trails).Overall, a good place for ardent hikers looking for a bit of history up in the hills, good scenery too, you wouldn't be disappointed."
Beautifully restored old fortress near Seoul,"Our family used to travel here when I was young as it was nearest rest spot for a weekend getaway. I had not re-visited this site until only recently...I was surprised by how much it has changed! This was a fortress palace that at one point in time was used by a king during invasion as a place of refuge. The walls and the buildings within are well restored. The way to get here is easiest/cheapest/fastest by subway from Seoul. From the subway, it is a bit of a walk to the outskirts of the fortress park, then quite a hike to get to the top. I would say you will need at least full day to view this place (during which you should be able to see little over half of the whole area). It is worth the travel and hike as you get some gorgeous view of Seoul city and experience what it felt like to be in a fortress palace."
Namhansanseong - Candidate for World Heritage,"Namhansanseong Provincial Park, located just south of Seoul, is notable for its great views and hiking opportunities. However, it is most famous for Namhansanseong Fortress. This fortress which dates mostly from the early 17th century was important historically as a refuge for the Joseon government in times of crisis.The famous siege of 1636 is perhaps the most important historical event that occured at the fortress. Roughly 120,000 Manchu Soldiers laid siege to the fortress, which was never breached. After 45 days the Joseon King surrendered after food/water shortages, and had to accept the conditions forced by through treaty by the Qing dynasty.The strength and position of the fortress are well-noted, and historically the fortress was nearly impossible to breach. With a force of only 14,000, Joseon soldiers were able ot repel 120,000 Manchu troops. Compared to Hwaseong fortress, Namhansanseong is better preserved and has much more history of active use in defense of the kingdom. Namhansanseong Fortress is currently a candidate to become a Unesco World Heritage site in 2014. For those who enjoy history and nature this is a great accessible day trip from Seoul."
