"Not much to see. But, significant structure in the history.","Built in 1897, this is the symbol of independent Joseon Kingdom. Relocated in the current area in 1979.The gate doesn't have much things to spend time. It's good to visit together with Seodaemun Independence Park and Seodaemun Prison."
Symbolic Gate in Independence Park,"Located at one end of Seodaemun Independence Park stands Dongnimmun Gate, a large stone gate built in 1897 with the funds kindly donated by Korean people, it symbolises Korea's strong desire for independence. To build the gate another gate, Yeongeunmun Gate, the foundation stones were relocated, two of the supporting pillars of that gate can be seen in the foreground to Dongnimmun Gate. Dongnimmum Gate and the foundation stones are listed as National Historic site #32."
relaxing park,"The gate was built in 1897 after the Sino Japanese war in Weihai. It's purpose was to inspire a feeling of independence from China which had traditionally been a protectorate of Korea. The gate was built at the site where Ming/Qing envoys were received by Korean officials from 1407.It was actually moved 70 meters from it's original site due to the construction of a new main road. There is a cornerstone from the old Yeongeunmun Gate in front of Dongnimmun. Photos may be taken around the gate, and although there are steps leading to the top of the gate, there is no access to the gate.The gate is situated in Soedaemon Independence park which has other historically significant memorial, statues and buildings. The Soedaemon Prison is at the Northern end of the park (former Japanese prison), Anti Japanese Memorial next to the prison, Independence Memorial commemorating the start of the independence movement in 1919, Independence Hall which was originally built in 1894 and a statue of Duhr Jae-Phil who was a leader of the independence movement and first publisher of a private newspaper in Korea.The access to the gate and park are free. It may be easily reached by taking subway Line 3 to Dongnimmun Station, and using exit # 4."
Not much to see.,Not much to see but if you have visited Seodaemun prison history museam then maybe worth walking past. From the prison it is only a couple of minutes walk through the park and right next to another entrance to the metro. It is a memorial gate built in 1897 and moved to the current sight in 1979. It therefore dose look different from the other gates I have seen in Seoul.
