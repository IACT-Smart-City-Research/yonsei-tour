Beautiful view on the mountain,"C1 ( 2016.10.07 ) This temple building was not big and normal, but the view in the temple was very beautiful. Though the road to temple was rugged, it was worth to climb to temple for scenery. There was very good temple because of fresh air and good view. The inside was not bigger than I think."
