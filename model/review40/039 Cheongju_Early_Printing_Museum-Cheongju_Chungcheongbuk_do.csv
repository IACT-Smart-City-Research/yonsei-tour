Museum about Printing that predates Gutenberg,"I have a particular interest in the history of writing, so this was an important and fascinating museum for me. It's small but very well signed in English. Korea beat Gutenberg to movable metal type by 70+ years, but hardly anyone is aware of that feat. The method of casting type/fonts is unique and differs from the western approach of molds. The staff members--particularly a young man in security office--were very helpful. He kept our luggage for us while we toured, and then he graciously called a taxi for us and went out in the snow to ensure we got away efficiently. It's very nice that it is free."
"free museum, worth a quick stop","Cheongju Early Printing Museum which houses the metal movable types for the Buddhist scripture Jikji, printed in 1377. The rest of the museum has displays with detailed explanations of the publishing process of Jikji along with some old Korean printing woodblocks and movable types from the Goryeo and Joseon era. A small display had a section of world history of printing. The content of the museum is about as exciting as what you’d expect a museum about printing would be but it’s free and makes a decent stop on the way to another sight. The grounds of Heungdeoksa Temple (where Jikji was printed) are adjacent to the museum."
It's okay.,If you come to Cheongju as a tourist it's one of the places you're going to want to visit. It is average at best but has there's no a lot to do in the city it's worth the stop. Although I wouldn't make the trip from another city here to see it.
Interesting display of the earliest printing type,You can see diaramas of the making and use of the earliest moveable metal type that predates western printing by around 200 years. Koreans invented this metal typeset in the 13th century. The jikji is the earliest printed publication. Interesting and worth a visit if you are a book lover
Jikji and more,"We visited the Early Printing Museum and we're delighted at the quality of the exhibitions once we got past the animatronic display. The actual exhibitions are a comprehensive look at printing history and techniques which were based upon the UNESCO Memory of the World book Jikji, which was printed with metal type about 80 years before Gutenberg. There was a great display just about how the book was created (the actual book is in the Bibliotheque Nationale in Paris). I would have liked more information on the book's contents and what it actually says.The museum is actually the centrepiece of a printing precinct that includes a park, the site of the temple where the Jikji was printed, numerous monuments a Metal type centre where they cast metal type using traditional methods(as a presentation for school groups), another Museum of Modern and Contemporary Printing (which isn't very well signposted) and some great shops (the ink and paper store is a highlight).Every second September they also host the international Jikji Festival, which is spectacular and brings out the whole community with displays, lots of food, performances, talks and a contemporary art exhibition."
Only replicas and crappy mannequins,I thought I could get to know more about the ancient printing technique....but only found the whole place is full of replicas and some crappy mannequins...so disappointed
Great Rainy Afternoon Activity,The early printing museum is a great rainy afternoon activity. There is English labels on most exhibits and they have the oldest movable style printing press of a book that is still in print. It's interesting and free.
"Fun, as long as your expectations aren't too high!","Reasonably interesting, but probably not one that will thrill kids. It's well maintained, but the film at the beginning, as the other reviewers have mentioned, is probably the most interesting bit, and for all the wrong reasons. It was entirely empty when I went."
Historical and Quiet,This is said to be one of the main attractions in Cheongju. The home of a printing press before Europeans. Park like grounds. Not a lot to see but if you are in town any way. Many languages accomodated.
Well maintained but a little propaganda-ish?,"The Good:- Free admission- Exhibits are quite comprehensive and well organised. (Detailed explanations on the printing techniques developed from each dynasty were given)- Beautiful museum compoundThe Bad:- Nationalistic. As some of the reviewers have mentioned, the exhibits are curated in a way to portray the superiority of the Korean paper making technology and downplay the significance of other civilizations.- ""Easy to get to, but a little out of the way."": The bus stop to catch the bus to the museum is opposite the Cheongju Intercity Bus Terminal, but you'll need to take a 30 minutes bus ride to view a museum which can be covered in less than an hour. To get to the museum, take bus 831 from the bus stop opposite Cheongju Intercity Bus Terminal and stop at Cheongju Arts Center (예술의전당). Cross the road and you'll reach the museum. To get back, take bus 832 from the same side of the road as the museum.*There's no English announcements on the buses in Cheongju so you have to be alert (Get off once the bus passes a yellow-green overhead bridge)."
"Beautiful Building and Grounds, Excessively Nationalistic Film","While the printing of the Jikji and invention of metal type are extremely important, they are not a reason to proclaim the genetic superiority of Koreans. The museum is informative on most points and is housed in a beautiful building with lovely grounds. Overall, the museum is a good experience but at times ""over the top""."
Jikji a Must place to visit,"This is a palce to be, and its free. Not many people know that the first metal printing press was not develop in Europe but in Korea. Printed during the Goryeo Dynasty in 1377 it is the world's oldest extant book printed with movable metal type. There is a room where you can view a video about the Jikji, they story was someone orders 500 book copy's and at that time you can't print that much at a certain time frame so they made a metal printing press so that they can finish the order on time. until know no one knows where is the 500 copies of the Jikji, but there is one copy guven to The first French ambassador to Korea, and when he passed away it was actuon to this guy and later donated it to the National Museum of France. so that makes it 499 Lost copies. Sadly this mesum does not have the copy of the Jikji but a replica but they dont display it, the lady at the front was so kind enough and showed us the jikji book. this musum is nice, you can push the botton, and you can see how they make the metal printing press (the procces) and some other atricats too. at the end of the musum you can print you're own Jikji using tradional paper which you buy for less that 500 won, there is a lady that will assit you. Outside the museum there is the temple, and that temple is where the Jikji was made. I would recomed this meuseum for people that are in Cheongju, just spend 1.5-2 hours of you're time and you will be glad you came"
boring,the museum was insanely boring. unless you're interested in ancient printing presses you're not gonna like it. they have a 'do it yourself' section at the end of the tour which is the only interesting part about it. the outside of the museum if worth a look though. the garden surrounding it is pretty nice.
Site of the earliest book printed by movable type,"The book printed here was the earliest book printed by movable type, printed about 60 years before the Gutenberg Bible. Unfortunately the book is in a library in French but the museum is fairly interesting and informative."
