Nice family activity,"We loved our experience, able to entertain our teenagers with chestnut roasting, rice cultivating and just exploring around the village with kind and nice people teaching us about the Korean culture in different locations. Play place made of rice and local materials and a nice outdoor cafe with traditional food for a reasonable price."
Good place to bring kids!,"A great place to learn about Korean culture. Affordable entrance. The day we visited they had traditional musical performances that caught the attention of my kids. After that, we walked around the village. As you walk you can learn about the houses and important people that lived in them. You can have traditional food and nice coffee as well. "
Peaceful village,"I always enjoy walking around Oeam Folk Village. It's such a peaceful place. Spring is especially nice when the kanadi and chindalae are in bloom. I've enjoyed a few picnics here, a great place for them."
Felt a little letdown,"I decided to visit this place thinking that it would be less commercial since it is still waiting for UNESCO status. Disappointed because the guided tour wasn't informative, despite asking questions to prob deeper. Of the 6 ""workshops"" listed, only the candy making and lantern making ones were available. Went for the half hour candy making ""workshop which ended within 10 mins. No explanation on the history or process. We were each given a lump of sugar to pull and that was it. Wasn't worth our 2 over hour car trip."
The rice field are so nice and pretty!!,"It was a nice little traditional village. I like the scenary and the country feeling, because the mountain is close by. It is outside of the city, so it was nice to feel like you were with nature. I like it. There are also shops and things to do and see here too."
A Wonderful Experience,I was taken to the Oeam Folk Village by my Korean colleagues. It was very interesting and nicely done. There are traditional Korean buildings as well as gorgeous flowers. The village is part tourist destination and part residence. Enjoy the cinnamon ginger drink and eat in the small restaurant. The kimchi pancake was one of the best things I have eaten.
A Nice Experiment..,It was a really nice and different experience for me to see Korean Culture and how they live at old times.. i recommend there to visit to see the old and valuable culture.. and to be honest it was nice walking..
Great daytime excursion,"Actually, I've been here twice, once in 2004 and again last month! Spring and fall are the best times, of course, though it was not too cold in February. We were able to visit a number of the older houses and see how they were constructed. We were also invited to taste locally-made liquor. This is a lovely excursion and a way to see the past together with the present in Korea."
Traditional Village south of Seoul,"An interesting visit. Located about an hour south of Seoul (depending on traffic), this folk village is surrounded by mountains in the Asan region. The village is in the middle of farm land with people working/living in the village. Smaller than the Korean Folk Village (한국민속촌) near Suwon but I think this is better."
Good place for experience about old korean village.,"Here is a good place to experience for old korean village. You can do homestay.Also there are several korean restaurant. So, you can taste korean traditional dish(food) in the village house."
Hanok Village,It is a great chance to experience how a traditional village (aka Hanok Village) is like. The village is surrounded by green paddy fields and lotus ponds.
A highlight of my trip!,"We didn't visit the traditional homes in the front where most people go, but the gentleman that drove us took us further into the village where his uncle lived. As we walked around, we came to a beautiful yard enclosed by a brick wall. The occupants of this home were so welcoming--inviting us to have tea with them. The daughter played a traditional instrument for us, and they showed us how the ondol heating system worked in their home. Then they took us behind their house to see the garden, dogs, and beautiful view of the mountains. We will always remember their warmth and hospitality."
Oream Folk Village - A Good Experience,"This is a traditional folk village. Part of it is outdoor museum and preserved homes. The other part is a small population that are living in the traditional homes but not in a traditional manner: cars, satellite dishes. I think it is worth couple hours of your time. You can go to lunch to their outdoor food court. Unfortunately, there are no bilingual menus so you will need to point to a picture or say a name of a dish. I did like the Namsadang Dancers. They performed for two hours on the Saturday I was there during my tour."
Ideal for families,"I went here in the fall this year as a teacher on a school outing. The kids and I had a great time! There is quite a lot to do, including traditional Korean games (Tuho, tight rope walking, swinging etc.), traditional huts and making objects out of straw. We had some tasty food too, including the best Korean rice cakes I've had that tasted like ultra creamy peanut butter! ^^ I generally don't like Korean rice cakes, but those were delicious. We also had ""organic"" candy floss - who knew such a thing existed! It too was tasty. Honestly though, if I wasn't there with school children, I think I would've been pretty bored. The kids made it totally worthwhile as we played games together and they were excited to explore, which rubbed off on me. Therefore I recommend this place for families. However, the scenery is really beautiful - set in the rural countryside, this does bring about an element of tranquility and solitude which is needed outside the bustle of Korean cities."
Asan Hanok Village,"There are a lot of famous traditional villages in South Korea like the ones in Seoul and Andong. The Oeam Folk Village is not as famous as the aforementioned but since there aren't as many tourists visiting the area, it's more beautiful and peaceful. For people who want to see the Korean countryside and old Korean houses, this place is a must-visit. "
Good for walking with glance-over,CC + cg ( 2014.02.14 ) This folk village was very good for walking and view about Korean folk village. This folk village's feature was a native people living there. The house in village had different subject from door to door. The village was larger than I think. There was many experience thing and traditional product. Good place to children and old man. The people aged 65 and over and a preschooler was free.
Korean Folk Villages Never Disappoint,"No two visits are exactly alike. All give a taste of the traditional culture, arts, crafts & architecture. Plan on 2-3 hours at least. Eat here."
Slow paced and very enjoyable!,I went here during the week. There was hardly anyone here. There was a 2 & 4 year old in our group. They loved running around. The village is great and shows what homes looked like back in the day. The cost was only 1000won for kids and 2000won for adults. It is close to the mountains. There is a small restaurant at the entrance. We had some cold noodle soup and kimchi. Our favorite part was up a hill under some trees. There were 2 great swings that we really enjoyed. Great views of the town and the swing went out over a planted field. The kids and adults loved it. This is a slow paced event and well worth a visit.
Pleasant Rural Joseon Village,"Oeam Village is not a ""tourist"" attraction, it is home to a couple hundred people who live in a historic clan village. I had a fantastic time walking the narrow alleys, and seeing the beautiful thatched and tiled roof homes. If you visit this historic village do not come here expecting some awe-inspiring site. The village charm reveals itself slowly, the friendly grandma, the unique distribution of water to each house and field, the rice fields, or the surprised farmer watching a foreigner explore his community.Oeam Village is not as large or as beautiful as Hahoe Village in Andong, but Oeam is special in its own way. There are only a couple of these types of old clan villages left in Korea, be respectful to people's homes and privacy, and enjoy the scenery."
