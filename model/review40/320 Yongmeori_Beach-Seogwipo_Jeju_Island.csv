Our Best Visit in Jeju,"We had a wonderful time, enjoying the beautiful rock formations. Great place to take pretty photos. The climb down on the rocky rocks can be a challenge but the reward is well worth it. Some ahjumas are selling their catch of fresh seafood too. Place may be closed if it is high tide."
A must see.,"If you are on the west end of the island you should definitely see this wonderful place. And, if you are lucky enough to see a few 'women divers' selling their fresh seafood (and you have a stomach for unusual and raw seafood) you should try this unusual treat. They will also sell you a shot of Suju if you need it!"
Beautiful Natural Stone,Visited on 19th October 2019.Check before departing because it's often close due to high tide.Unforgettable experience there with stunning spot to take photo.A must visit. Enjoy!!
Coastal geography lesson come alive ,"Pretty interesting coastal erosion processes and fantastic landforms. This is a relatively easy short walk along the coast. Be careful, however, if you're bringing kids or elderly person - the rock trail can get rather slippery and some parts will see you getting very close to the sea and waves. "
Closed in strong winds,Great scenic spot with narrow shelf or rock at the base of cliffs which were part of an old volcano. We visited on a day of high wind and rough seas and the site was closed as the path was too dangerous. was able to visit the climate exhibition centre and see the model of the Dutch Ship De Sperwer wrecked hundreds of years ago. Also took the walk up the hill to the beacon tower.
It's an instagrammable place that won't disappoint you,"It's a beautiful place for you to admire the view and take IG photo. If you're good in photo shooting, you might be able to trick people that you're in Grand Canyon."
Wonderful rock formation,"Really enjoyed the walk around the coastal, all the rock formation is awesome. We walked around from the shipwreck and back again to the same spot. If you love nature, this place is a must."
Good for short visit,Just a dead volcano mount. Nothing special. Weather there i good for rest. Maybe good place to view sunrise
Coastal walk up close & personal,Odd yet beautiful layers of rock formation. Frequent beating of waves and wind carve a character into the coast. Including the side profile of a crying man. Perhaps our fav spot throughout our stay.
Nothing much,There was nothing much to see here and we got pretty bored almost as soon as we got there. Go elsewhere with more stuff to see/do when you're in Jeju.
The beautiful Yongmeori Coast ,We engaged a Local private driver to bring us to Yongmeori Coast. He made a call to the Relevant Authority to check the weather and tide condition. Yongmeori Coast is situated beside Mt Sanbangsan.The car park was full that day and fortunately we found one lot. Our driver guided us the walking route to the coast.He was indeed a good private tour guide!We were immense into the nature and its beauty. He skilfully captured many memories into pics for us! This trip was my most memorable part in Jeju.
This place is stunning ,"I am traveling with my 79 years old dad who has weak knees. When our driver brought us to yongmeori beach, we have no idea what we are in for. Because of my dad, we chose to enter the beach on the left entrance and exit by the right entrance which we heard is the opposite direction of what most people would do. From the entrance, we had to walk down a very steep stairs which led us directly onto the beach. Honestly, the walk down the stairs was a bit dangerous as there was no railing or any safety measures. Despite collecting entrance fee, there are no staff around if you need help. That said, the scenery was stunning. The natural formation of the rocks was beautiful and the water was clear. For a popular tourist destination, this is also one of the cleanest I have been. You don’t see any garbage around. I hope anyone who plans to visit, continue to keep this place clean. As we had to walk slowly, we completed one round of the beach in over an hour. "
Haenyeo selling their catch of the day,"Witnessed the haenyeo selling their harvest of the day....wonderful site, both the scenery and haenyeo at work"
Amazing Closeup Views of Rock Formations,Love this natural rock formations along the coastal beach walk ... definitely not your usual sandy beach ... lots of opportunities for great photosThere are ladies selling fresh seafood catches along the way ... we didn't have time to stop for that though ...
Must visit!! ,"Not your typical stroll on a beach. This is more to walking on stones by the cliff. Please do wear comfortable shoes for walking at this location; not easy to walk on the uneven stones. Wind will be a little strong too, prepare a light windbreaker will help. There's certain times that you can't enter this attraction due to high tide (you can walk along the cliff) or strong wind. Please do check the opening time before heading there. The journey took us around 1hr to complete the cliff tour. There's a trail leading to a temple, but we did not go for it. There will be fresh seafood sold long the cliff, it cost us around 20,000 won for a plate of it. My guide told us that the price still can be negotiated."
Scary but amazing,"Our 70 year old tour guide could climb these rocks to get here. The Grand Canyon of Jeju. Whilst it was breathtaking, I couldn’t help but constantly call out to the kids to be careful of the slippery rocks. There are life rings hanging on the cliffs but let’s be realistic. With currents that strong, if you fell into the water, the current would crash you straight into the rocks. We went early morning when the tide was out but could feel the tide level rising. Our guide wanted to go further as he said it was more spectacular.Make sure you go with good gripped sneakers and a jacket. You are on the edge of the ocean after all. "
"Nice view, nice walk!","This is a beautiful area. The breeze, sun, and walk were refreshing. The water was many colors of blue! Lots of people though!"
Must-go in Jeju ,"My number 2 favourite place in Jeju after Oedolgae. The rock formation of the cliff on this volcanic island is really fascinating! Before going, do make sure it's low tide time because it will be closed during high tide as it will be too dangerous. We also saw some women (should be women sea divers) who were selling fresh sea produce to those who want to eat them fresh and raw there. From there too, we could get a clear view of Sanbang Mountain which is just nearby. There's also a ship there and you can read about the history of how the ship ended up there. Be careful as you walk along the coast as sometimes you might be shocked by the sudden strong waves that come hitting towards the coast. I saw someone who was so shocked that she nearly dropped her mobile phone into the sea. Overall, it's one of the must go places in Jeju."
Cultural visit by kaist students,Reminds me of kenyas hells gate. The place is a sight to behold. Be carefull to put on comfy shoes that have great treads and grips so that you dont slip on the sometimes slippery rocks. Also find out about tides. If its high tides then definately you will be soaked by action of water on your feet. Good place though. I recommend finnishing it with a horse ride by the ajoshi at the exit for man won and a cold jeju tangerine juice.
Amazing view.,Kids friendly. Do not miss! Head up early in the morning or in the mid afternoon for a comfortable experience.
Can't go inside due to the bad weather,"From Seogwipo city, I took the bus number 202, stopped at Sanbanggulsa. It took me 1 hr to reach there. But the coast was closed due to the weather, but I still could walk around. Across it, there is a temple on a mountain, you can climb up there too if this attraction is closed."
Beautiful coast side walk,This is highlight of my Jeju West Coast Trip; it's beautiful scenic walk; however its not an easy walk. My mother has difficulty to walk on this path and return to the entrance after 10 minutes walk. There are some woman divers selling abalone near the entrance and its quite fascinating to see them.I highly recommend to visit this attraction while you are in Jeju and its very close to Mount Sanbang where usually people visit for trekking.
MUST VISIT,"this was one of the most memorable places i visited in jeju. the coast was not an easy walk through, there were 2 entrances/exits for the coast. we took the one with large rocks we had to climb down through. (would recommend taking the other entrance which was behind a large ship) it was scary and there were a lot of sea roaches scurrying around. the VIEW AND WALK around the coast was worth everything though. the coast right infront of sabangsan mountain was filled with canola flowers."
Beautiful Scenic View,Had a great walk round the coast.Great weather with beautiful canola flowers.Great place for photography as well.A must visit place in Jeju!
It was high tide when we visited ,"Couldn't walk through the rock formation due to high tide when we visited that day around 11am , so we just took some picture with the lovely yellow color flowers for 1000 won per person entry , there's a horse ride nearby too with a old wooden ship , fresh seafood available, it was a good place to take pics ."
Interesting ,"Beautiful place to take a nice walk around the shore line. Can imagine it would get a bit busy in the summer, but it was empty when we visited as it was a snowy winter day which by all accounts added to the experience. Be careful though it can become a wee bit slippery when the rocks get wet. "
Breathtaking with many people!,"Yongmeori Beach is a great place to visit, the erosions along the coast is just amazing. The place is just located along the coast, there are no fences or anything to keep you off. The place may not be open to public every day because if the winds are too strong they do not allow entry, so you may want to check before you come. It gets quite windy and there is not much shelter so remember to wear a jacket and bring a hat. I recommend spending around 1.5 to 2 hours here, it will make a great walk."
Mother Nature's Million Year Old Coast,"It took us more than an hour to get there. The wind was so chilly that you could feel your fingers freezing up when you take your gloves off to take photo. But it is absolutely worth it ! The rock formation,formed layer by layer from lava erupted long long ago is so mystic & original. It's like touching rocks that are a million years ago. Come dressed warmly in comfortable shoes if you plan to walk along the coast as it is very very cold, wet & slippery. Nevertheless, not to be missed if you are travelling to Jeju! "
Yongmeori Coast,You can find this at the Sanbangsan Mountain area. It's a really good rock formation brought by years and years of the sea waves slapping those great rock walls. 
Beautiful natural art,"This place was breathtaking! After getting a yummy octopus pancake we walked around the cliffs admiring the beauty and the ocean. We started on the west and ended on the east it was a beautiful, windy, gorgeous day! Great place to get fresh seafood from the lady fishermen too. "
AMAZING ROCK FORMATION,"This place is an epitome of beauty, beautiful rock formation, beautiful sea, beautiful waves, beautiful clouds, it is amazingly beautiful. Here you enjoy both worlds of rock formation and beautiful sea. Definitely this place is super windy and you might get wet with huge waves hitting against the rock formation. The scenery of the place couple with the beautiful sound of waves for me makes any visit to Jeju complete. Be careful in walking and exploring place, there are areas that are slippery and rough. If you are an instagram addict this place is the best for you. You can choose to have those lovely rock formation as background or the beautiful blue sea with the huge waves and or both the lovely rock formation and waves. "
Loved it! ,The beach was super pretty.. not a long walk.. Very clean.. it was amazing.. And the water was super clean which was really nice!! Love it!
Beautiful,This is a beautiful beach! It was peacfecul to look out over the water and watch the families enjoy themselves. It was also great to drive along the coast and forget about the worries of the day.
The best coastline people can access,"a coastine with beautiful cliff and rock - the line and layer of the rock are ideal for photography or selfie. Not difficult to walk but cautious for the waves, also there is open view over the outlying islands. I recommend people go to the end of the path which has a exeptional setup by the nature."
Dragon Cliff,Beautiful views and the locals were so welcoming! I got some sea shells from here and one of the locals shared some soju and fresh caught octopus! 
Dragon head shape coast.,"C1 ( 2016.07.14 ) This coast had good trekking course with sea view and wind. When it was heavy wind, there was no entry, but there was very good in good weather. Beautiful place."
Interesting coastal walk,I was here last week with my wife and we enjoyed the walk around this part of the coast. On a light drizzly morning the walk took on a determined bent but we were certainly not alone. There were loads of people when we were there. The backdrop is fairly dramatic looking and there is a small entrance fee. The view from the top at the carpark is quite beautiful too.
Intersting,It was rainy day but it was worthy to go here. So nice shapes of rocks. A little slippery ground. Nice views.
A Must-visit in Jeju,"Didn't have any high expectation when visiting this spot after the waterfalls. A good thing we visited this Dragon Head Coast while doing the west coast route.The canola flowers site is a paid visitor spot (should be around KRW2K each adult). There is a Viking ride @ the base for the young ones to try. You can see many interesting lines and grains on the side of the rocks' walls. You get to see women divers selling fresh seafoods along the coast, youngest are already in their 50s and oldest are in their 70s (still diving)...they are simply amazing."
Quite a fun attraction! ,The cliffs here have odd and somerimes beautiful formations. It's where you can put your creative photography skills to work! It costs 2000 won admission and it is very close to the edge. Strong wind or waves can be a little dangerous i thought.Along the coast are also older men and women selling freshly caught seafood and you can eat it there as well. 
Nice photo location. Nice view of the sea. Nice place to listen to the ocean splashes and to get wet!!,"We spent more than an hour walking to and back from the beach. The place can get crowded and you can walk farther too but we stopped because of the huge waves. Nice photo location!The stairs can get quite challenging for older folks because it's uneven and slippery even, so have to be careful. There is also some distance of walking from the car park."
A sight for sore eyes ,"It was a short drive from Seogwipo where I stayed with my son In late Dec. The trip was highly recommended by the Shilla hotel staff and I could understand why after having spent an hour on its rugged coastline. Awesome selfie spots at every turn! Another highlight was the women divers selling their harvest (sea cucumbers) on the coastline. It was a stimulating walk, with crystal clear waters lapping at our feet. We went when the tide was receding as advised by the hotel staff. So do check before venturing down. 2nd tip: go well bundled up as it can get very cold in winter. As a reward, we headed to the Hiddink cafe at the end of the trail (next to car park) for a hot cuppa. It felt like we had stepped into a Dutch village, replete with tulips and clogs. As you can probably guess, Korea is still besotted with the Dutch football coach. "
beautiful nature walk,"in front of mt sanbangsan, this is a nice place to visit to see the great scenery and cliffs where you can take a walk along the coast around the cliffs with the interesting formations. When we were there, there is a sign that states the opening time (for entry to the coast) is from 3pm when the tide is low."
Plan your visit,"At the time we reached here, the coast was closed due to bad weather condition. We just managed to walk arounf that area. It's located in front of Mt Sanbangsan. "
Those spectacular rocks will blow your mind away!,"My family and I drove to this awesome natural attraction and walked along the layered rocks and cliffs produced as a result of a volcanic eruption on a beautiful non-windy and sunny morning. Safety concerns: Yeongmeori (Dragon's Head) Coast is opened from 8 am to 6:30 pm from May to September. It will be closed when the weather changes in a way that impacts people’s safety (e.g. high tidal waves, strong winds), so it is better to call to check before going. Also a rainy day means that the rocks and coast will become slippery and you may have problems taking photographs. in any case, you definitely need a good pair of walking shoes.2 walking trails: You have to take note that there are 2 trails and entrances to Yeongmeori Coast. Both trails meet each other but are not connected due to safety issue, which means you have to pay separate entrance fees. However, I saw a white bridge is presently being constructed that links the 2 trails, but it remains unclear as to when it will be opened. Between the 2 trails – Trail 1 and Trail 2 (described below) – I found Trail 2 to be safer for walking and has more spectacular sandstone rock formations and cliffs, and because of that my family and I spent about 3 hours admiring the attraction and taking photographs. Trail 1: This trail is where the tourists go, and starts after the Hamel Castaway Memorial and the Hamel vessel. You park your car (along with the tour coaches) at a car park that’s next to a mini theme park (with the Viking amongst others). You then walk along the seaside promenade next to sandstone layered rocks along the sea, which takes about 1.5 to 3 hours return after the ticket booth (1,000 won for adults & 500 won for teenagers & children). Since certain stretches of the promenade are narrow, you have to walk carefully so as not to fall into the sea and onto the rocks.Trail 2: This is a shorter trail that in theory should only take about 30-60 minutes return after the ticket booth. You park your car just beneath the temple. Parking is free. Cross the road and look for 3 bronze circular structures with inscriptions of “Jeju Island Geopark”, “Global Geopark Networks” and “New 7 Wonders of Nature” and a green signage “Yongmeori Coast Entrance -> 300m” From there, you just walk down the steps and follow the path which will take you past several shops. After about 10 minutes’ walk, you will reach a ticket booth. After buying the tickets (1,000 won for adults & 500 won for teenagers & children), turn left and you would come to the top of a narrow and steep passageway to the coast. Take your time to carefully choose the big rocks as your steps for your descent (and then I realised what the term “stepping stone” means). There are no handrails. Once you reached the bottom after about 6 minutes (longer when there are many people), turn around and look up at the challenging and difficult passageway and appreciate your achievement! Looking across the sea, we saw Mount Hallasan. Instead of going left, I recommend you go to the right and once through a archway or hole in a rock wall, and you will soon encounter the spectacular irregular layered and wavy sandstone cliffs that often contain ‘pot-holes’. The rock formation at certain places was carved out by a blade that cut itself into the layered rocks, creating v-shaped clefts. And when the waves crashed into the rocks, it sounds like roaring thunder – awesome! There’s a short cement bridge where standing on it allows you to take a superb photograph of the rock formation and the narrow stretch of turquoise-coloured sea. It is also around this same spot that you can take another superb photograph of the cliffs with Mount Sanbangsan in the background. There were 2 ladies (I didn’t think they were the famed ‘Haenyeo’ sea-divers) at the shoreline with 3 basins of sea animals - sea snail (sora), sea squirt (myeonggye) and sea cucumber (haesam) – who would be happy to enable you to experience Korean culture of eating raw seafood by the shoreline. I didn’t like to eat raw seafood so I didn’t try.Overall, my family and I think that Yeongmeori Coast is one attraction in Jeju that ranks it as among the top 3 attractions in Jeju. Don’t miss it! It will blow your mind away!"
Awe inspiring sight,The cliffs are carved by the sea and you can walk the pillars of these cliffs all the way around the small outlet. Be careful not to slip and fall as it is very wet and very rocky. But the view and the scene and the smell of the sea are all worthwhile. There is also some small nearby attractions and food stalls
Another amazing attraction in Jeju!,a unique nature architecture here. There are extreme tour there which is to walk and climb around the coast. It will close if weather is not good. Near to Sanbangsan
Very Wonderful scenery,There are two 2 entrance through the section above or below. I choose KRW entrance fees below KRW1000 but his path a little farther and i very happy to see the beauty of the stone and the beach.
nice view,"did not really go down to the beach as it was raining and need to pay to see the 'dragon head'. there's a small shipwreck museum which is good rainy day activity, nice for a free museum. like the yellow canola flower field at the parking area with sanbangsan at background. didn't went up sanbangsan due weather as well."
"Lovely long beach with open sea views and islands, bike trail","This is a very long beach along the south Jeju coast near the south-western end. You can bike (there's trial, do segway, or a long walk) or drive and stop along places to take beautiful photos. At the end of the beach is Songacsan where you can hike for an hour or so - very easy."
Plz remember~~~ Tuff ring not sand layer!,"This is great place to enjoy scenry, learn about hydro-volcanic activity and Jeju island formation process if weather permite you to go there.Coz of wether change, sea level is getting higher, the days you could go getting less. So plz before you go there, call the attration site office. 064-760-6321Ejoy the this place."
Head of Dragon Beach,"They call this place because it looks like dragon's head. There is walking area around that stones so you can see that from the right beneath. But at that time of we are there, path is closed due to bad waves."
Breathtaking view!,"The route to go down to the beach is very challenging! If you bringing kids, extra cautious is a MUST! Quite dangerous as the routes is very steep, but once you arrived the view is AMAZING! For a few seconds, there is NO WORD can describe the feeling! I can't believe I go down that steep routes! A place to heal & purify your mind as well SOUL! They charge you with a very small amount of 2000 won for adult, 1500 won for kids and FREE for senior."
"Gorgeous, scenic and natural","This is one of the most remarkable scenic attractions of Jeju. Our Korean driver brought us here. We told him we are not interested in arts museums or teddy bear or maze park. We only wanted to see the natural sites and wonders in Jeju and he brought us here and we thanked him for that. There was a Buddha Park directly at the car park where we alighted. I could see the golden face of the Buddha from the highland opposite the park. From the car park, the panoramic view of the beach was amazing; the lush green vegetation studded with autumn foliage with long stretch of gorgeous coastline and natural cliff view and the azure sea horizon. It was nature's master-piece presented in so marvelous and harmonious form that I could not find better words to describe this stunning, breathtaking and jaw dropping scenery. For a moment, a sensation of joy and happiness flooded and filled my heart. As the gentle sea breeze blew on my face, I found tranquility, calmness and serenity in this beautiful land. I immediately dashed down the flight of stairs to embrace this beautiful and spectacular piece of natural wonder. I roamed and wandered around the scenic landscape and found myself singing the Happy Wanderer lyrics: `I like to go a wandering up the mountain track And as I go, I love to sing, My knapsack on my back. Val-deri,Val-dera, Val-deri,..' There was the Hamel Castaway Memorial and the vessel Hamel that drifted to this place in 1653. I stood near the replicated Hamel vessel to admire the European naval architectural of that time and I saw the rangers tendered to the horses in the range. From the coast, I could see the majestic Mt Sanbangsan loomed at the site of the Buddha Park and I could vividly see some of my group members were resting and relaxing at a pavilion below the car park enjoying the gentle sea breeze.You must pardon me for my excitement and exhilaration as I came from a city with urbanized concrete jungle with little natural scenery. Jeju is full of natural wonders and Mt Sanbangsan and Yongmeori beach are exceptionally gorgeous gems that deserved a good lengthy exploration."
Wauv!,Absolutely beautiful place - a must-see-experience if you go to Jeju. Amazing what nature can create and then its just next to a mountain and a small temple with a giant gold-Buddha. Go see this asap! :)
excellent view.,"interesting shapes of rocks and lovely blue water.not too difficult, short walk along the trail. there are 2 different trails starting from different car park. both trails are not connected at the moment due to safety issue so make sure you visit the right one.by the look of it no.2 may not available or can be very wet @ low tide.i like the both but personally like no.1 trail little more."
Unforgettable and Impressive Nature,"My friends and I traveled to this scenic coast in year 2011. It was not part of my itinerary but it was introduced by our driver. I really impressed by the nature of this tourist spot. It is located along the Coast of South Western of Jeju Island. I can say it is the most Scenic spot of Jeju's Coastline. Yongmeori Coast looks as if a dragon’s head is going underwater. This area is made of Sa-am stacks, built up over millions of years.It is the place where the mountain dips into the sea at the Yongmeori Beach. Formed out of the natural piling of stacks of ‘Sa-am’ that have been occurring for millions of years, the locals equate the formation of the Yongmeori Cliffs in Jeju with the image of a dragon’s head going into the ocean for a dip.You may find more information through the website. In year 2011, there were less tourist as it was not as famous as other hot tourist spot like Seopjikoji that time. I cannot remember whether is there any entrance fee needed. However, please wear sport shoes as there are some climbing the rocks to tour this place. After the long entrance, our driver guided us and we walked in the circle of the shape of dragon's head rock. Our driver was a very good photographer who shown us to climb near the cliff just for the nice photograph position. Recall back, my legs were shaking and didn't dare to make a move for posting all those difficult photography position! I think I will never this again!  Along the road down to the coastline, there is the Hamel Castaway Memorial, in remembrance of Hamel who drifted to this place in 1653 where Korea in the history did not open their door to the World yet."
Marvelous towering cliffs!,"The stacked cliffs of Yongmeori are beautiful! This was one of my favorite sites in Jeju. It's a very windy walk but in the summer, this provided respite from the humid heat. The rocks are uneven and bumpy, so it is a good idea to wear sturdy shoes.You have to pay a small fee but it's very much worth it. Along the walk, there are women selling raw seafood meals for 10,000 a pop. It's a very simple set-up: plastic stools and chairs, some garlic, gochujang, and soju if you wish."
This is one of the must see in Jeju. ,"This is one of the must see in Jeju. The most beautiful rocky beach in Jeju. Hamel ship (copy) is on beachside. You can check some pics on TripAdvisor. Spring season is high season. Summer season is also high season, but check if typhoon is near. Check the typhoon, you cannot go close beach if there is typhoon. It is not normal beach, waves carved this beach for long time, hundreds of thousands of years. "
Highlight of the trip,"I have never seen anything like it. The walk was unbelievable! A must see and do in Seogwipo. Great for travellers who love nature, hiking (must wear comfortable shoes) and photography. Highly recommended."
Beautiful Cliff,"My family was recommended by our (Nam Yang Taxi) driver cum guide to this ""must visit"" place which was not in our initial planned itinerary. We are so glad to visit this captivating cliff by the beautiful blue sea!! It was a breezy cosy walk enjoying the marvelous scenery and shoreline natural volcanic black stone. It wasn't difficult for my parent (just walk at own comfort pace) especially for my dad whom was aided/help by our taxi driver/guide whenever required. This is our most loved sightseeing venue among others. Indeed a ""must-see"" attraction!!"
another nice spot turned into a tourist trap,"they charge admission now to see this seashore. as if that's not bad enough, it was closed by the time we arrived at 5pm. but what wasn't closed were the numerous vendor stands that seemingly sprung up to cash in on the tourists here. the most interesting thing we noticed were various coconuts with small holes drilled in them with a straw sticking out. this is supposed to be 'fresh' coconut water. protip: there are no coconuts in korea. superprotip: they re-use these containers without rinsing them out, over days/months/years, you get the idea.if you don't mind paying to see this 'natural wonder,' at least avoid the vendor stands like the plague, cause that's what you'll likely catch there."
Excellent views ,"As mentioned this place does not get a lot of attention. Today while we were there, were surprised to see a lot of local Korean tourists. From Seogwipo bus terminal (the one near Jeju World Cup Stadium) take bus 702. There is announcement in English. Alight at Sanbangsan. This place is truly nature at it's mightiest, the wind/sea carved walls/cliffs are very different from the rest of Jeju's natural beauty. Entrance fee is 2000 won for adult and 1000 won for child. Take time to enjoy the wind, sunshine and views as you strolled. Along the way, there are old ladies selling fresh seafood and soju. There is a mini theme park next to one of the entrances. There is Viking, trampoline.. A number of stalls selling bbq squids/seafood, mandarin juice, chocolates and mini cakes. Good for the kids to take a few rides. All in all, a good half day spent in nature. "
Unexpected Highlight,"This place toally blew me away with the beautiful rock erosions. I never expected that this would be the highlight of my trip to Jeju. I could see the clarity of the blue green water up close. Assured that the seawater was so clean without any fishy smell, we even ventured to sample the live seashells. What an unforgettable experience we had, dining on the rocks with the gentle waves lapping in front of us."
impressive,"This coast is easily the most impressive of Jeju's natural sites. It has a small entrance fee and may close due to high tide, but it is a must-see on Jeju if the tides are good. The water pools on the cliffs are really blue and many women divers sell their catch along the coast. I'm not into seafood so I didn't have the nerve to try it though. But the walk along the cliffs was really nice and I enjoyed the beautiful cliff formations."
Nice coast,"Lovely place with great seaview, but beware if you bring kids or elderly as the stone walk are not too easy."
The highlight of my 2 day Jeju tour,"The Yongmeori coastline was not on my list of places to see/go when I first planned my taxi tour itinerary, but I was persuaded to go by my guide, Mr Lee Hong Min. I am so glad that he brought us here as it turned out to be the highlight of the tour for me.There are 2 ways to access the coast - and you'll either begin or end up at the very impressive looking stone ""stairway"". To walk the coastline, you don't need to be superfit as it's not a tough hike, but some might find the rocks to be uneven and slippery so do watch your step even as you take in the beautiful scenery. The round trip takes about 30 mins for the superfit and about an hour for families.The scenery of Yongmeori is breath-taking, especially for someone who's never seen such rocky formations before. Turning every corner drew exclamations of awe from us and we took dozens of pictures throughout. You can really see where the sea has eroded away the cliff, leaving craggy sights that vaguely remind me of the Grand Canyon. You can even see the inhabitants of the sea that were left 'stranded' at low tide, waiting for the high tide to return - small fish, oysters and mussels, and some weird cockroach like crustaceans scurry along the rocks. Haenyeo or women divers set up stall along the coast so if you fancy a fresh seafood snack, you can feast on the rocks for a unique experience unlike any other.Tip: There are no toilets once you pass the small stalls set-up before the attraction entrance as this is natural scenery attraction so do make sure all in your party go first before you enter."
Most beautiful experience on Jeju,"I highly recommend a visit here! My friends who came to visit said it was their favorite experience on Jeju.The sandstone cliffs have been intricately carved by wind and water over the years. They are stunning up close, and most days you can see crustaceans, interesting bugs, and other life in the tide pools. Check out the gorgeous bright-blue water. And possibly see some women collecting shellfish and sea urchins to eat and sell!Be sure you walk all the way around the point. It's easy to think you can't, but the narrow path hugs the rocks to make a loop. Beautiful and totally worth it!"
Very Awesome & One You Must Not Miss,"I came here expecting mundane rock formations. Ohh how wrong I was. This is one of the most beautiful places in Jeju. The rock formations are gigantic and so artfully formed. Be careful when walking as you're walking beside the water and it can get slippery. We even sampled some fresh raw seafood like sea squirt, sea cucumber, sea snails and octopus with rocks as table and small children chair as our seat! No soju for us as we're driving!You park at the base of Sanbangsan and walk across the road to reach Yongmeori Beach. Entrance fee varies depending which location you want to visit."
Check the tides and go counter-clockwise,"One of the best stops we made in Jeju. This rock formation is pretty cool and the stop is more worth it since it's a good hour's worth of walking and snapping photos (as opposed to a number of the really touristy places where it's just one kodak moment).Check the tides. The rock formation that people walk on are really close to the water, so if the tides are high, it gets slippery. Actually, some parts are slippery as it is.You have two options: going counter-clockwise, which ends up being an upward movement OR going clockwise, a downward movement. The views are nice-ish both ways (personally the counter-clockwise views were nicer). More than that though, going counter-clockwise is a lot easier as the steps are easier to deal with moving up. Many of the people coming down were cursing the steep rocks and were tired even before it began for them. Might not recommend this if walking is difficult for you as climbing and hoping around is a must. Little children were around and they seemed to be enjoying themselves, but none of them were younger than 3 years of age.No bathrooms once you enter the formations, but ladies will sell you food and drink (mostly alcohol) if you're interested in a seaside meal."
Breathtaking! The best is yet to come!,"As our tour guide said nest stop is the beach... i was wondering how can any beach rival Philippine beaches? But as we get nearer i saw it,,, a hill with a small island... really shaped like an oriental dragon serpent just starting to submerge into the water. It was a sight to behold! so we went down the trail and enter the coastline path... it was so beautiful! the coastline is carved by ancient volcanic eruptions and was smoothened by the waves. it was a 30min walk around the coast line and as we were walking the view just gets better and better. when we turned a corner around 14 minutes in the walk. The best view suddenly came out. no amount of words can describe the rock formations we saw. we felt small beside it. Along the way were many old ladies selling seashells and sea urchins and sea cucumbers for us to taste as sashimi (raw fish) to be downed together with soju(rice wine).These ladies were the famous jeju island deepsea divers. They dive without oxygen tanks. After the walk we were all tongue tied at the beauty of the past 30 minutes. Yongmeori means dragon head coast. and it really took a dragon size breath away from me. Entrance only 6000won (6us$)"
Awesome!,Enjoy the breathtaking views of the ocean and impressive rock formation while walking along the coast. Very beautiful and unique scenery that is really beyond description. The beauty of nature is really awesome. One has to be there to experience it! Thanks to our guesthouse owner for recommending this place!
Beauty beyond description,Yongmeori is an excellent beauty but one has to walk along the coast during low tide to see its true beauty. The rock formation is unique n a city dweller like me walk each step with awe looking at the formations. I believe anyone who enjoys nature but is brought up in a concrete jungle will love this place.
Beautiful scenery with coastal lines!,"This located just opposite to the foot of Sanbangsan. We saw the supernatural volcano scenery there. If you like, you could have a few hours walk in Olle route. Lastly, be sure to try the CO2 hot springs in Sanbangsan nearby, it's very local and famous in Jeju!"
Good and average,You need to pay 2000 won to do the beach walk . A rocky formation where people lay on flat stone to take sun. I guess it's up to you
Yongmeori Coast,"Yongmeori is a rough and dramatic coastline shaped from lava eruptions. Walking along the spectacular rock formations is an experience that only Jeju-do can offer. Firstly, some of the water pockets with bright turquoise water are striking in their uniqueness. Secondly, the sometimes bizarre rock formation are nothing if not eye-catching. Lastly, the strange (slightly grotesque) insects that scurry along some of the rocks are strangely interesting. They never touch or climb on you, every footfall makes them scurry in all direction. Yongmeori is a bit off the ""classic"" tourist itinerary. Most visitors enjoy a beach or two, maybe a hike at Hallasan or the Seongsan Ilchulbong, and perhaps they fit in a waterfall and museum. Jeju has so much to offer that is often overlooked. Yongmerori Coast is one of these places."
Awesome!,"I heard from the owner of our guesthouse that this place isn’t always open because of the tides and weather, so if you have the chance to go, take it. It’s an amazing rock formation, but unlike the ones that you can see at a distance, like Oedolgae and the Jungmun Daepo, you can actually walk on it. That rocks. It took us a while – was it an hour? – to walk along the perimeter of this massive rock. The terrain is not smooth – think of desert sands except that the undulating surface is made of rock instead of sand, so wear study shoes that won’t split because of the damp. It looks like a movie set -- for an alien planet. Really, I didn’t know such a place existed on earth.If I were taking someone around Jeju, I’d recommend this place and I would definitely come back so we can exclaim together.Where: Seogwipo west coast"
Not touristy,"If you're looking for a quieter Jeju beach, this one will do it. Off the beaten path slightly and near the beautiful Yongmeori coastline. If you're in the area, check it out!"
Just enjoy the view. Enough said ;),Love the view. It was spectacular! Went there during winter. Freezing cold but you could see the dragonhead! :D
Gorgeous Coastline,The Yongmeori coastline is stunning. Cooled lava rock from the volcanic eruption of Mt. Halla millions of years ago has turned the coast into a stunning walk. You can also eat fresh catch from the local Haneyos (Korean women divers). Recommended!
tricky trek,"It was kind of windy when I had my visit at Yeongmori cliff. At first, I thought it was another ordinary rock formation viewing after taking a few steps from the entrance...I was about to back out from the trek thinking I can see much of these in the Philippines, but as soon as my tour guide led me to the farther side of the cliff, I started to appreciate how unique the lava rock formation was. The best view to take a picture maybe is to include Mt, Sanbang in the back draft. You may also climb a few steps to the top or catch a good timing for huge strike of waves by the rocks. Wear appropriate shoes as the pathways are always slippery and wet. "
"Sea, mountain, Bouddha's temple... Dragon head seashore","all of them are migled to produce the best view and combiation. If you are at Sanbang temple, you can see the Dreagond head from the back side,"
