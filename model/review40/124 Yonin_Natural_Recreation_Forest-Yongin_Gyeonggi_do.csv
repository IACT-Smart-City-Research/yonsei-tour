Great place for family with kids,"The place takes reservation, so they control the number of people in the facility (genius!)There are 2 groups of people : 1. Day visitors. I am one of them, and use the facilities for a couple hours or so and leave when kids tire.2. Guests in the dorms. There are lodging facilities in the area, and they stay the night. This is something I need to do later on.Just make sure to bring food if you plan to stay for long, cause there's not a whole lot of choice."
