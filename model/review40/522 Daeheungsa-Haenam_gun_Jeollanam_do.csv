This temple area was bigger than I think.. Excellent.,"CY ( 2016,11.23 ) I and my wife visited this temple to feel temple's mood. This temple was bigger and older than I think. The atmosphere and view was very good because there was surrounded beautiful mountains. The entrance fee was higher than I think, but it was money well spent. It was good experience to walking around this temple with cool wind. Recommendable temple."
A very self-finding and appreciative experience!!,"From the arrival to the departure, this is an experience to die for!!! I came with a group. The staff (monks included) ensured that we were treated with so much kindness!! The temple stay was an experience which indeed changed my life and I will never forget the bits of advice given by the monk during his address to us. "
