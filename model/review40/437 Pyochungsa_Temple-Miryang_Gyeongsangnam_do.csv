Excellent place..,Execellent place to visit. The journey makes more enjoyable due to cloudy weather. The apple garden and Jujube garden on the road give us thrilling experience..
Beautiful,"What a beautiful mountain scenery! I went there just a week ago and the summer was right there! They also have a hiking road. I was so glad that I got crossed this place off of of my must-visit list. The admission fees cost $3(U.S.) per person. If you bring car, you should pay fees to reserve a parking spot."
