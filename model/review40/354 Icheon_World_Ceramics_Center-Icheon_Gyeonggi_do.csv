Not bad when around,"Nice garden , special layout and modern buildings makes this and intresting couple of hours. If you into ceramics this will be super for you. "
Excellent museum about ceramics,"C1 ( 2016.09.09 ) I didn't expect this museum because I thought there had some ceramics. But there was big size museum, and many ceramics work was exhibits. There had experience area, exhibits area and good garden. I didn't know about the ceramics works, but this museum made me admired with good works. There had many works by global artist. Excellent museum with beautiful ceramics works. And the staff was very kind to me. Recommendable place."
Going to Festival 2015,"Great place for viewing or purchasing Korean ceramics. We had the great opportunity to visit with some Korean Master Potters and came away with a very different impression of what ceramics is all about. The pieces here are beautiful, exquisite, and some quite expensive. But you can find some wonderful pieces items at very affordable prices. If you are into pottery or ceramics, this is a MUST visit. "
Brilliant Museum,Best ceramics museum I have been to. Interesting Biennale work - wide range and lots of on site workshops. Lovely environment and just extremely well set out.
Takes about 1 1/2 hours to get there,"Smallish number of shops, about 50+. Prefer Mashiko in Japan. If you hunt around, you can find something reasonable for $50. A good piece costs about $200-300. I took a subway to Gangbyeon, then took express bus to Icheon, then took a taxi to village. The express bus passes by the village. It goes into the mountains, then makes a right turn on the freeway, passing a store with large black pots, then a fleet of autos for sale. On return, took a bus back (bus is on the main road), but got off too soon,so walked back to bus station. Note that you have to stand by the bus stop to get a ride. Driver doesn't stop if you're sitting down. Ask your hotel to write down Icheon bus terminal in Korean so you can ask for directions or a taxi ride.Note: Coex mall is a few stops pass Gangbyeon and has good restaurants."
Ceramic Festival & Seolbong Park,"I am an English teacher in Icheon. My school had it's birthday, so I decided to go to the ceramic festival. It was a great opportunity to walk around and take photographs. Seolbong Park is right beside where the festival is held and it is quite a breathtaking site in Icheon. I love going there to take photographs and take a walk."
Beautiful Ceramic Art,This place is amazingly beautiful and peaceful. You are surrounded by art. Located on the grounds is a large outdoor kiln and behind that a body of water. In the body of water are wonderful porcelain pots of various size and shape. the works of art displayed out side are beautiful. My favorite the the metal tree with porcelain bells. This place is truly a wonderful place to visit. You can see the cities passion for ceramic all over. On the mountain sides are porcelain places and the bridges hold ceramic pieces. You truly should not miss out on this.
Local culture,The newly opened art center at the top of the complex is extraordinary. If you have any time at all go to see this 'expo'
Worth the hour's bus ride from Seoul to see the heart of pottery-making in Korea.,"My husband and I took a local bus from Gangnam Bus interchange (Gangbyeon subway station) and the ride was cheap and comfortable. You get off at Icheon bus terminal, and just hop into a cab to go to the Wirld Ceramucs Center. My husband and I thought that we could walk... So we did and enjoyed ourselves. But I won't recommend because it took over an hour and we were huffing and puffing. By then we spent precious time walking and were in an exhausted state of mind. But the Center made up for all the sweat!! It was gorgeous and I spent an enjoyable hour having a class (~US$10) on using ceramic chips to make a picture. The teacher made up for her limited English with peals of laughter and enthusiasm for her craft. I bought a cup made by a resident artist and took a pic with her. How meaningful to support local artists!My husband and I then took a cab to the pottery village where there were clusters of shops selling celadon at very reasonable prices. In fact be expected to pay as much as 60% less vs shops in Seoul. The creativity of the local artists are so inspiring... I bought heaps of work to decorate my home, and as gifts for others. My only limit was my flight luggage allowance and the bus ride back. :-) I think Icheon is the supplier for many shops selling pottery in town. So why not spend a meaningful day out of Seoul and take the path less trodden? Just a note that you should have lunch at the Center before heading off to pottery villae cos we found it difficult to find restaurants. Cab fare from pottery village back to Icheon bus terminal was about US$8-10. It will be useful to get your hotel concierge to write in large print the Korean names of the places, cos level of English proficiency kinda takes a dip outside Seoul. But I didn't speak a single word of Korean and still found it easy to navigate! Highly recommended."
