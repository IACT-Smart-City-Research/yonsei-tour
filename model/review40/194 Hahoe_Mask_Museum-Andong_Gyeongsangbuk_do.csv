Unique and enjoyable ,"A delightful experience as the museum features masks used in performance not only in Korea but all over the world. Much of it is in English which is not very common so it was good getting detailed information on the origins of the masks used in Korean culture especially. A summary of the various performances, the storyline and characters was given. The 'yamban' (aristocrat) seemed to be used frequently as a figure of ridicule and criticism while the priest, old woman (usually wronged and ill-treated when the husband takes a concubine) and servants play important roles.Masks from other cultures were also displayed and their significance explained. The Japanese Noh drama (video of dances) was succinctly explained while the significance of the lion in chasing away evil spirits in Chinese folklore was pointed out. Southeast Asian dances with masks as in the Balinese Barong were discussed together with more remote regions like the Maldives, the South Pacific and Maori and Native American cultures.There's a small souvenir shop and coffee shop at the exit before you go off the Hahoe Village or take bus No. 246 back to the Andong terminal.

Great Museum,Your entrance to the folk village in Hahoe cover entrance here. Its a modern building with a number of masks from around the world. Its worth calling in here before you walk around the vilage. 
A very complete museum covering international masks,"This museum has a very complete display of many eras and countries of folks masks, with a very appropriate representation of Korean, but covering many other countries and cultures, as well. Well worth a visit, as part of a visit to the Andong Hakoe Folk Village."
Interesting place,"Nice place to visit. Not too big, with a lot of funny masks to see, and also how they make them out of a simple piece of wood. You can learn the story behind the masks. We have a very nice sample of the couple, got it as a present from our Korean friends, and hanging in the living room and still enjoy every day."
Great little museum!,Very interesting and informative museum. Wonderful masks from different places. Great imagination and skill. Highly recommended.
Not bad at all,"If you’re interested in traditional/ethnographic art this museum is quite interesting with a large collection of masks from Korea (mostly) and from around the world. Some nice pieces from the Pacific Islands and even a few masks from Africa. Interestingly, and uncommonly, most explanations are in English too, which is a rare but very welcome bonus."
Don't miss the Mask Museum,"The Mask Museum is by the car park where you buy the tickets for Andong Hahoe Folk Village. Entrance is free and as well as having masks from the region, they also have masks from all over the world. There are actually 300 Korean masks and over 30 other countries have contributions."
Very interesting ,A small museum with a great collection of Korean masks. It takes about an hour to walk through and it’s well worth the visit. 
very interesting,and try not to miss a mask dance performance in Hahoe. fun and interesting. The area is lovely and the mask museum is quite extensive. 
Good museum,This was actually the highlight of our visit to Hahoe. The entrance here is included in the price of the entrance to the village (5000KRW) and it is actually a very good museum with a lot of very beautiful masks from around the world and a reasonable amount of information given in English. Worth going to if you have made the effort to visit Hahoe from Andong. 
Face/Off,Nice little museum of various face masks artifacts from around the world and spanning quite a few years of history.Some are quite hilarious & comical whereas some others are downright frightening in their design and expressions.It's definitely worth stopping in and having a look after getting off the shuttle bus coming back from the Hahoe Village.
각종 다양한 탈을 볼 수 있어서 즐거웠던 곳,"안동 하회 마을 입구에 안동 하회 세계 탈 박물관이 있다. 1995년 9월에 개관한 이 박물관 내의 모든 탈은 김동표 관장이 한국탈 19종 300점, 35개국의 500점 등을 직접 모았다.At the entrance to Andong Hahoe Village, there is Andong Hahoe World Mask Museum. All of the masks in the museum were collected by Kim Dong-pyo, 35, and 35 of the 35 countries in Korea.개성 강한 다양한 탈들이 전시되어있어서 나는 무척 흥미로웠다각 나라로부터 모아진 탈들은 표정이 살아있었다.I was very excited because there were so many different types of masks displayed. The masks collected from each country had a semblance of expression."
Interesting ,An interesting museum of limited size. The masks are wonderful and everything is labeled in English. A good dose of culture 
A great visit for historians or mask enthusists,"I personally love and collect masks so this site was of extreme interest to me. However, my wife and children also enjoyed the exhibits and hands-on portions available as well. TIP: near the gift shop there is location to make a traditional colored art project....fun for kids and adults!"
Interesting Place,Liked seeing the different masks from all over the world. It is a nice concept and the museum is well maintained. 
Great display of masks from around the world,"Only went here as thought it would be a good way to finish up the village visit. Was well worth it, they have masks from all over the world in very good condition, colourful and beautiful too. There is also video of a mask dance to watch if you are there when they are not running the live show"
Mask Museum in Hahoe ,"Great museum, masks from all over the world. Too bad they don't have a more developed section on Korean Masks. They should also have at least one book in English about Korean Mask tradition at the gift shop..."
Child friendly & interesting,"With masks from all over the world this is a very, very interesting museum. Also for kids who can collect mask-stamps and fit some masks for themselves. Not to big, so you're out before children get bored. "
Great little museum when you are in Hahoe,Really great collection of masksWell worth the time Takes 40 m to see everyLong trip from Seoul but if combined with other activities then it is great 
Excellent Collection,Really good collection of Korean masks and a good selection from around the world. Pity the shop does not post masks overseas as they are somewhat fragile to carry in bags and are quite interesting artifacts.
The best Mask Museum,"It covers world wide countries and different culture. But the best is the local mask. It is right before you entering the village, but you need to spare more time for this museum, so If you can plan your stay inside of Hahoe village, you can have a really good experience."
Masks & Masks,It's actually quite an interesting museum with stories about all masks in Korea and from around the world. But actually skipable if you do have a tight schedule.
Mask Museum,An interesting show of masks from all ober the world and some great explanations as to their history and use. Comboned with the Hahoe village a great day out
Fascinating,"I really loved the diverse and colorful mask collection! It was a great joy on this rainy day and really gives you an impression about the traditional festivities among the ordinary people, in the area of Andong and throughout the world."
A small nice place to visit while waiting for bus,"The Mask Museum is next to Hahoe Village and the string of resturants outside the village entrance. We went in as we had around 1.5h to spare while waiting for the next bus. It was a small museum. Level 1 was dedicated to Andong masks. You can don the masks for fun too. There are English explanations for all exhibits, which is a great plus. Level 2 is for masks from other areas in Asia. There was even a small part for Ventician masks. Overall, it is a nice place to spend time in."
Great collection of Korean masks.,"This museum is located near the UNESCO listed Hahoe village famous of its mask making traditions, shamanistic rituals and mask dances. One floor of this museum presents the local masks and the other international masks. The museum is enjoyable but if time is limited head straight to Hahoe."
A Highlight In Andong,"We spent 2 nights in Andong...actually in Hanok Village.Right near the drop off point for the shuttle. Admission is a very reasonable 3,000...about $2.70 US.Plan about 1 1/2 hours...2 floors. So interesting and colorful. Masks, masks everywhere. Different countries, different styles and different colors. All beautiful. Nice gift shop at end. Clean restrooms. All good. 5 STARS. Do it for sure in Andong."
Masks masks everywhere,"A beautifully put together little museum dedicated to guess what...? masks thats right. Its actually not a bad little place and very affordable to see ₩3,000. New and clean inside and out. If you're already in the area to see the folk village, might as well cruise on over to see the masks."
Fun museum while waiting for the bus,"We had about an hour to spend before we could take bus 46 back to Andong after visiting Hahoe Village, so we decided to pay this museum a visit. We didn't regret! It has two floors filled with all sorts of masks from all over the world, quite beautiful ones and quite scary ones too. You won't spend more than an hour or so here, but it'll be a fun hour."
Interresting.,Small museum but very interresting. Plenty masks from everywhere. Tell story about it.3.000 Won for an adult.
Good if you have an interest in masks,"If you like masks then you will definitely enjoy this place as it has a huge collection from around the world and a good written history/explanation of masks in Korea. The museum itself is also in a clean. modern and well maintained building. For me, I found it just a little limited and boring."
Most fabulous mask museum,"If you like masks, or even if you don't, this is a beautiful museum filled with masks from around the world. Beautiful displays with good descriptions. Photos are allowed. Gift shop unfortunately does not sell any masks. "
Masks in many cultures,"This is a nice museum to visit to get an idea of what is behind the masks (no pun intended) that you see in so many gift shops in Korea. I especially enjoyed seeing the roles of masks in so many different cultures. If you go in the winter, it is quite cold - keep your coats! Lovely bathrooms as well for the weary traveler."
Very nice,"I visited the Mask Museum after watching the Mask Dance, so I got to understand the meanings behind the masks used much better. It was small but and quite fascinating, with masks from around the world.My entire trip around Korea is described here: http://ttlgawift.weebly.com/around-korea-in-15-days.html ."
Interesting and entertaining - regional and world masks,"Masks were worn by common village folk across the area to mock and entertain. Due to the class differences, various upper class roles were 'role played' using masks (so that the wearer could not be identified). Masks are made of all different material, such as: wood, gourd or flax. There are three halls: Korean masks, Asian masks and World masks."
Masks from All Over the World,"I have to admit that I didn't expect much from this museum. It's on the outskirts of a tiny tradition village (Hahoe), which is known for it's traditional mask-dancing performances, so I thought I was going to see only the (roughly 12) traditional Korean masks through the ages. I was so pleasantly surprised to find an incredibly comprehensive museum, with masks from all over the world, well curated and 99% with English descriptions. Our time there went from an expectation of 15 minutes to about 90 minutes! Really interesting stuff there! Definitely recommend it."
Interesting!,Great place to learn all about the mask history in Andong and Korea and see masks from all around the world. 
Masks around the world,I went here during the annual mask festival. They allowed me to take pictures of the masks. The entrance fee was reasonable. The staff was very helpful. I loved seeing where different masks came from on the planet. There is a huge mask culture throughout the world.
Great Little Museum for Masks,"Good little museum with a focus on masks from Korea, and also from other parts of Asia and the world. W 2000"
