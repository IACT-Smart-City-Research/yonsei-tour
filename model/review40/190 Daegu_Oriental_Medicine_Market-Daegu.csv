Searching,Great place to go eat chicken stuffed with rice and other medicinal items. They will address your medical needs.
Fragrant wandering,"I wish I could travel in time to see this market as it used to be (as depicted in the nearby museum.) Still, it was fun to wander and see the various offerings. I loved the different smells and sights."
Very interesting but lingo issues,"If you are vegetarian or not keen to ask around avoid. Else,do go.From wholesale ginseng to tomato wine to soaked deer antlers, keep guessing as you see strange contortions in the name of roots and shoots. Very few shops have English signage but the folk are very friendly. "
Unique Place,This is one of the treasures of Daegu. It is so fun to stroll along and have the scents of the oriental herbs surrounding you. There are many beautiful and historic places nearby and many cute cafes.
Rich in culture,Korean medicine is very rich in terms of history. They have a museum that will educate you on the cultural history of oriental medicine. There is a display of several species of ginseng - from the common to the most rare and expensive. Along the streets you can buy herbs and other concoctions. This is also adjacent to the underground shopping arcade in Daeju.
Quaint Oriental Medicine Market,"Very nice area to stroll through to look at a traditional medicine market. Another world to spend about 15 minutes of your time in.The street is marked with a traditional gateway at either end. Broad and clean street with shop windows on both sides displaying medicinal products; some in beautiful glass bottles.At one end of the street, you'll arrive at a modern shopping area with a big departmental store."
Smells like ginseng ,"I loved skateboarding through this part of Daegu. It's very close by the downtown area. You'll find anything you could possibly need/want in this area. It smells really nice walking around this part, because of all the ginseng. If you're in Daegu, I recommend you take a stroll through here. If you get to close to Daegu station or you get offered sex, then turn around. I lived in Daegu for 3 years and skateboarded all over so I knew how to find myself when I got lost. Just pay attention which direction you walk and look out for big statues as place markers. Enjoy!(:"
