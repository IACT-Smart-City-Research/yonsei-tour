Smallish nice aquarium,Limited number of exhibits but animals seem happy enough. Unique is the pair of belugas that were active and responding to the crowd at feeding times. Also has lots of smaller tanks with a variety species. Nice to visit for an hour or so.
Enjoyable visit -Aqua Planet,It was a 15 minute drive from hotel in Yeosu to the Expo compound. Taxi cost about 13000Won or US$15. Situated within is the Aqua Planet. During the day not many visitors sighted but fills up in the evening. Educational tour so worth a visit by school students. Itâ€™s also fun for the grown ups. We also enjoyed the tour. Many activities inside. Check out the Marine life. Aqua forest theme. Ocean theme. 3D museum. 5D theatre etc. cost for the package was 34000 won each or approximately US$35. Many cafe and restaurants inside with a good view of the Big-O. Huge complex. Lot of parking. Lot of walking to do. So do wear good comfortable walking shoes and enjoy.
Aqua planet Yeosu,"This is my first time to go aqua plate like this but it has strong impression on me after all.This is very beautifull and nice place.It is very suitable for your children for not only let them feel happy but although bring new knowledge and enthusiasm for them.I hope you guy have the same experience.Best,"
Cool Exhibits,Not too big of an aquarium but has plenty of things on display and a good way to spend a couple hours.
Cute aquarium,I had a fun day at Aqua Planet with looking at the different species. There are shows available throughout the day but they are not available in English but you can guess some of the content of the show.The gift shop is a little pricy but that's what a tourist place is.
Great place for a rainy day.,"I love nature and so zoos, sanctuaries and aquariums are some favorite places. This is the best one I've been to - a wide variety of underwater life, displayed to great effect.The layout - a central rotunda with themed exhibits opening off it, allows you to structure your visit. The information brochure is very detailed and a great guide to seeing what you'd like to see.The beluga show was amazing.I must say I'm not really that much into sculptures being used to create an atmosphere, such as in the riverine exhibit, but all in all this was a very worthwhilte visit, especially as it was raining heavily and the rest of the Expo site was not accesible in such weather."
Must see in Yeosu,"The place is located within the Yeosu World Expo area and is one of the bigger attractions around this area, if not the biggest.Prices have reduced since a few years when I first visited, and the beluga whales are back!... although the aquarium seems way too small for them to feel at home.The ""alive museum"" area was a novelty, and would only recommend if you get it as a bargain grouped sale and not as a standalone ticket."
Worth a trip,It's great that I got to see a pair of Beluga for the first time! Had a great time with my family :)
Quite good,"The build and construction is quite unique , with pathways literally going through the big chamber aquarium. Then the show they gave at the end was quite impressive too :) i enjoyed it, worth checking out."
Good!,It's good but not excellent. Belugas(white whales) were attractive and cute. It's interesting to see baby shark flipping in the yolk sac. The others are the average.
Beware for bad accoustics,I was here on a Sunday when a lot of families visited and the spaces weren't planned for that kind of noise levels at all. Loved the jellyfish. Pitied the belugas in their tiny tank. They have a big variety on different animals.
Lots of unique interesting fish,"Exhibits were well done, interactive, and thought out. The aquarium is small compared but very charming and educational"
Overhyped~,"This place is not really anything special. It may be the largest aquarium in Korea but it is still very small in international standards. The take with the beluga whales looked so small I felt very bad for those whales. All of the tanks seem way to small for the amount of fish they have in them. The price of entrance is over-priced as well. At the end, both of us looked at each other and thought we may have missed something but unfortunately we didn't. They did also have a 4D theater and a trickeye museum which I guess is good for young kids but I wouldn't recommend doing it.The selection of fish is limited. For people who haven't traveled much then maybe this is very interesting but if you have been around this is a place you can skip, nothing unique here!"
Aqua Planet in Yeosu,"This is a very big aquarium, maybe the biggest in Korea. There are two aquariums named Aqua Planet, one in Yeosu and the other in Jeju. This one was built to the event of EXPO 2012 Yeosu."
So much fun!,"Personally love aquariums a lot and I really had a lot of fun with my friends. Do pick up a programme booklet at the entrance and go for as many of the activities as possible! Most of them are feeding sessions and the animals are cute beyond imagination.The beluga whales really left a deep impression on me. Recommended for couples, friends, families with kids and solo travel."
Good place for a half day visit.,"For about 23k won,you get to see some rare whales and tiger shark among others and have lots of fun.Places are clean and well organised and certainly worth a go."
Nice place to have fun,It is a nice place. You could have a lot of fun and you could learn at the same time. The place has a nice coffe shop and food court area.
Really good place with Kids,"Family trip,Took 4 hours, you should check the show schedule Really good place with KidsTip is left side of Main tub (looks like screen) there's cafeteria / Inside of this cafeteria there is good table to enjoy the view"
Very good day spent in Yeosu!!,"Definitely worth visiting the Hanhwa Aqua Planet!! It was a fun day filled with lots to do! Not only do you get to see the wonderful aquarium, there is also a 4D experience AND a Trick Eye Museum (the Alive Museum). Tip: Make sure you take extra phone/camera batteries, or at the very least put your charger in your bag so you can charge your device while drinking a coffee or having a nice lunch at the food court..! Enjoy...!!!"
Great aquarium,Our kids enjoyed this place so much. The place is interesting. There are many things to see and some good shows. We got 20% discount for tickets because we stayed in the MVL Hotel.
Great aquarium at the site of the 2012 Yeosu World Expo,"Good for adults and especially good for kids. The main tank's display window is as big or bigger than a movie theater screen, and the tank supposedly holds thousands of fish; it is huge. Many other speciality tanks as well. Be sure to ask the ticketing folks what time all the various shows are, else you'll miss them. It's 5-600 meters from the Yeosu MVL Hotel, and also close to the train station. Lots of parking because it's at the site of the 2012 Yeosu World Expo. (Parking fee was small.) Yeosu is a great little city to spend a long weekend in."
unique,"If you would like to see belugas, this is a great location; corals, sharks are limited. Kind of a strange ""mermaids"" swimming to music was a dominant feature; loud and not very interesting.Can see it all in about 1h."
Best Aquarium in Korea,"I've been to the CoEx Aquarium in Seoul and the 63 Building but this is by far the best aquarium in Korea. It is new and has a nice variety of fish and sea life. My kids, 2 and 4 year old, had a wonderful time. It opened at 10 am and we were able to see lots of ""shows"" ( otter feeding, penguin feeding, Beluga whale show and main tank feeding of the manta rays) by lunch time. We ate in the aquarium restaurant patio and the food was not bad with good portion size and great view. We were able to go back in to see the synchronized swimmers in the main tank and touch tank. The kids loved the doctor fish (they nibble your fingers) and touching the sea stars. We bought our tickets on GMarket and saved about $10. You can use your ticket to get a 20% discount for the rail bike. June was a great time to visit. No summer crowds."
Great aquarium for children or adults!,"I traveled to the Aquarium with my in-laws and 26 month-old daughter. I loved it- and my daughter had a really good time running around and looking at all the great wildlife. By way of comparison, about three months earlier we had visited the National Aquarium outside of Baltimore. It wasn't the best of times for my daughter and she was a bit grumpy, but if I had a choice of the two again, I would choose Yeosu.The layout was great. The fish seemed to be healthy. There were a few different places to interact- my favorite was the doctor fish, where you could put your fingers into the water and let the doctor fish eat away. Also, there was a small pool where you could pick up starfish and smaller shelled...crabs? Mostly, though, it wasn't so huge that my daughter would get bored- which I think she did at the National Aquarium.The gift shop was small, but nice and I thought the prices were reasonable.All in all, it was a great experience and if you are in the area, why not give it a shot?"
