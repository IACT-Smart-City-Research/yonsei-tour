Temple with serene atmosphere,"Conveniently located with options of walking from Beomosa subway station or taking bus 90 to the temple at Won1300 per adult.The peaceful and calm atmosphere at entrance was soothing with lots of vegetation.Well maintained park and a nice walk along the main path passing decorative gates to the main temple. Visitors can participate in prayers at temple too.Worth to donate a tile for the temple upkeep with your wishes, name written on the tile at Won10,000 a tile. A spring water flow at temple is cooling and drinkable. Not crowded as the spacious compound with surrounding hills suitable/popular for hiking as well. A well worthy visit amongst the Temples of Korea"
Spacious temple,Went end of October but trees are still mostly green. Interesting 600 year old fertile female Gingko trees with lots of Gingko fruits. Nice walk uphill.
Super turisty,"The temple is ok, like many other korean temples but it gets very crowded. The setting is beautiful and hiking to the diffent hermitages is even better than the temple itself in my opinion"
Good Day Out,Caught metro then the 90 bus. we went on Sunday and lots of walkers. We planned on seeing temple and then walk up to north gate. The walk was strenuous but picturesque.When we reached gate we saw people on top of mountain and decided to walk part way and before we knew it we were nearly at top and then went all way. It was worth it has it has 360 degree views. Definitely recommend walk to top it took 4 hours there and back from temple.
Temple at the TOP,"Beomeosa Temple is easily accessible by train to Beomeosa Station (Exit 5) on the orange line. Recommended to take a taxi from Beomesosa Station up to the temple to save your energy walking uphill, costing Krw 4500 or less. Unfortunately, it was raining when we arrive and we could only cover the temple ground missing the walking around the temple vicinity. What a waste!"
Walk ,After a long drive a very good place to get out and walk around. Would liked to walk the trails but we did not have time.
Nice temple up in the hills,This is a nice hotel up in the hills. Its in the outskirts of Busan but very easy to find using Naver Maps. I recommend taking a taxi from the closest subway station. Its very cheap (KRW3500) and takes you all the way up to the temple unlike the bus.Got nice buildings and nice view. It also have a stream nearby.
Beautiful temple,"Beomeosa Temple is one of the important temples to visit in South Korea. You can reach the temple via hiking over the Geumjeongsan temple or reach Beomeosa subway station and then take a 15 min bus ride to the temple. I have tried them both but hiking gave me a wonderful experience. The trails are completely easy to follow up, plus the added beautiful scenery. One of the must-visit places in Busan"
Three Gates,"3p* Beomosa TempleWalk uphill, lots of steps, difficult, through three beautiful gatesSeveral prayer forums; need to take off shoes; no photos insideStone lanternStone pagoda"
Amazing temple,"Visited Beomeosa temple on a rainy day, the atmosphere was extraordinary! A peaceful place, the temple consists of numerous praying halls, each beautiful and unique. Highly recommended!"
Beautiful temple,"This temple is a must visit when in Busan. The temple has quite a big car park, but you can also take the public transport to get there. The temple is beautiful in itself, but the surroundings make every visit unforgettable. We loved the impressive collection of buddha statues. You can experience the temple to the fullest during a temple stay, but even if you're just stopping by for a short visit, you'll love observing the bustling temple life. When we visited there were several ceremonies going on."
Active temple,The most exciting part of this temple is watching monks and others chanting and praying. It is an active temple and you leave feeling like you have witnessed something special. Being high in the mountains adds to the atmosphere. We purchased a roof tile and inscribed a prayer on it also. Lovely colours in the temple and it certainly feels alive!
Highly Recommend,"Beomeosa is one of the oldest temple in South Korea. It is located in the beautiful Keum yu Mountain. We got there by taxi. We are not Buddhist, but we really enjoy the building and atmosphere of Beomeosa. "
Beomeosa - The oldest temple in Korea,"Beomeosa is a must-visit temple if you have a chance to visit Busan. The air is so pure and peaceful. I spent my last day morning in here and felt quite relax even temperature went up so high to 38 Celsius-degree outside. Just head up to Beomeosa metro subway station and exit at gate 7 or 5, then riding on bus 90 up the mountain to the top. You need to walk for around 10 minutes at last bus stops. "
This should be a Must See,"This temple is a little outside of Busan, but well worth the trip or extra time if you have to go in or out of the Central Bus Station. The whole complex is gorgeous. We saw Haedong Yonggung Temple and Bulguksa Temple, but Beomeosa was different. It was alive. The other temples were great to visit too for different reasons, but were mostly just history points, tourist attractions. People were still praying meditating and being respectful, but there was a feeling of stillness, inactivity at them. Beomeosa was alive, active. The atmosphere was completely different. There were monks living there, people having religious classes and meditations with monks, monks leading chants for prayers/meditations at shrines. There is a temple stay program there. It's a living, breathing active temple, not just a historical attraction. Even if you've seen other temples, this one is worth visiting. It is well maintained. Be respectful, quiet and aware that there are no pictures allowed inside the shrines. The outsides of the buildings are ok, but not inside. Take good shoes, because there are some great trails nearby. if you're a hiking buff, look at nearby walks/hikes for sure, there are many trails crisscrossing the mountain that would be well worth the trek. 100% recommend, must go."
Beautiful Scenery,"Beomeosa Temple is outside of Busan. It took us approximately 40 minutes by tour bus from the port to to the temple. It was an up hill wall from where the bus dropped us off to where the temple part begins. There are several lovely gates along the way that you walk through and statues to see on your way to the main temple area. If you like taking photos of scenery, you'll be able to get some nice photos once inside at the main temple area. The only downside for me at this temple was the squatty potty restroom."
Wonderful Temple,"I decided that I had to visit this temple, and found that it was so easy to get to thanks to the wonderful Korean transport system, the number 90 bus takes you from the Subway to the temple, and then you have a small walk up to the temple. The temple looks beautiful, and was busy on the day I went, but with so much space it was easy to get around, some wonderful photo opportunities, but mainly an area of peace and tranquility, where you can reflect on life."
A Beautiful Large Temple Complex,"This is one of the top tour attractions in Busan. You have to take a Metro train and bus to get there, but it's worth the trip. Many classic temples and structures to tour. It is a bit hilly, so be prepared. Recommended!"
Visit the Temple,It is an old temple which is well preserved and we saw a few MONKS and many tourists praying at this place. Nothing unique but can visit
Interesting visit,"We took the metro to the nearest station to Beomeosa Temple and then a taxi for 4000 krw up to the Temple. It is a steep climb up and the taxi took us to the top. On the way back, however, we walked down the path to the main road to pick up the taxi to take us back to the metro station. There is alot of walking and climbing steps involved in visiting the temple and no place to sit and rest. The first thing we came upon was the Beomeosa Museum which is free and open 9 - 5, closed Mondays, and worth a few minutes of time. Change your shoes in the entry to shoes shoes that are available to use walking in the museum. Pick up a map that will give a layout of the temple complex and tell about the structures. You can peek into some of the buildings and watch the happenings which I found very interesting. Upon exiting and getting ready to go down the hill we found a walking path in the woods."
"Interesting, worth going","This temple is out of town and its hillside location adds to the atmosphere. We took the easy route of booking a temple tour combined with a cultural dance experience and had a good day.Our bus dropped us at car park right by the start of the climb to the temple. If you’ve read that you need to be able to climb 100 steps, it’s true there are plenty. Fortunately, this is not one single flight of stairs, more a sloping path with several lots of steps. It’s easy to take your time and look at the gates, statues and monuments along the way. Even though busy, there is something mesmerising about the climb and arriving slowly is part of the pleasure.Busan was one of the best places for viewing cherry blossoms on our holiday."
Temple stay,"We stayed at the temple for one night. We got a tour by one of the monks, which was very nice. The temple looks quite beautiful, and the views on the surrounding area are nice too. What I liked most was the music made by the monks, which I think everyone can go to, as it was in front of the main hall.I thought the temple stay program was very interesting, but the sleeping facility was absolutely terrible. The 'matress' is just as thin as the blanket, so you basically have to sleep on the floor. Nothing like the Japanese futons I slept on once. No one in our group slept much that night. The food was nice, and the potatoes and the pancakes were very tasty."
lovely Temple complex and do the hiking Loop,Lovely well-maintained Temple complex rebuilt in the 1600s. Well worth it. Sure to take the lovely Serene hiking Loop that goes through the woods and around the strings before you leave.
Great temple complex,"We have not seen so many prayers in Korean temples. But mostly women. The area was decorated with large numbers of coloured lanterns, which created an interesting atmosphere and feeling."
Steep climb but worth it,"An interesting temple set on quite a steep hillside. The different gates and large numbers of coloured lanterns enhanced the atmosphere. Each of the prayer halls was busy with worshippers. Also, once you get to the top there are good views."
Lovely,"A collection of pavilions forming the temple complex - peaceful area to wander around or to sit & think. The down side if you find walking difficult, is the long walk up with lots of steps."
Temple!,The amazing architecture of these buildings makes it impossible to pass this indifferently! I was there many times but today I took my fiancée for the first time and just like me she was charmed by this place! As with many temples - getting there for a foreigner is more difficult but beautiful places are worth sacrificing!
"history, culture, religion, and tradition all mixed in","The headline of my review could easily apply to every single other Buddhist temple build in centuries past not only in Korea but in any Asian country. That said, this headline is no less accurate to describe Beomeosa Temple.Those of us who are from the west almost certainly first saw Asian architecture in movies about Asia (oftentimes martial arts movies from decades ago), but seeing it close up is quite another matter. This temple originates from 678 AD, which was during the Silla Dynasty (which for those who know Korean history, started before the birth of Christ).The seriousness of the Buddhist devotees who live and study here is palpable. One part of the temple is off-limits to visitors and chanting was easily audible. There are several different structures and in at least two I saw priests praying.The reason I am ranking this review ""very good"" rather than ""excellent"" is not related to the venue itself but rather to my own experience, which took place at night. Had I been there during daylight hours, I would have been more able to enjoy the beauty of the landscape and the natural environment the temple is located within.I would go again - in daytime! - to get more pictures."
Beautiful temple on the mountain ,Early morning visit. There were few people and the bus was just a short twisty ride. The highlight of this visit was the hike along the ridge of Geumjeongsan from the North gate to the East gate and exit SanSeong village. This was my personal trek for scenic views and a half day of exploring the mountain fortress. No regrets. 
BEAUTY,"This is, above and beyond, the most beautiful temple in Busan. Great settings in the mountains, and a chance to have a free English guiide, too!!"
Nice temple; starting point for Geumjeong fortress hike,We walked to the temple uphill from the subway station although there are buses that take you to the temple's parking lot. The temple was quite extensive and had some pavilions with beautiful carvings. Temple staff/volunteers were very friendly.On the left side of the temple is the starting point for the 1.7km uphill hike to Geumjeong fortress' north gate.
A beautiful temple!,We visited on a rainy weekend when the crowds were at a minimum. Despite the wet weather we found Beomeosa to be absolutely beautiful. A gorgeous walkway lined with art led to the main courtyard and buildings. Cloud drifted in during our stay but we were still able to get some fantastic photos of the temple buildings and surrounds. Well worth a visit. 
Far but Worth to Visit and Hike!,"Take Metro Line 1 to Nopo for Beomeosa Temple, avoid alight at Beomeosa Station which has identical name, though u could still reach by bus no. However allight at Nopo and take bus 90 just outside station will save you a 500 meter of slope walking to bus station and could be crowded too, especially weekends.this Temple is huge, but more of meditation temple, and many are reconstructed which doesn't look ""old"".At the left of Beomeosa Temple, a trail to hike up to the North Gate, one of ancient fortress gate. The beginning signage stated about 1.4km, but its definitely longer, so prepare to walk slow on the granite stone trail, 10-20 degree steep, not too tough, but also not easy hike too. Make sure you have walking shoes and preferably a walking stick, and bring along water and some foodstuff.To reach North Gate would require roughly 2 hours, descending could be 40 minutes."
Find your spare time on a busy schedule.,"It is the third largest Buddhist temple in Korea with a history of 1,000 years. Therefore, although the temple and the buddistbuilings are large, the scenery of the surrounding area is also outstanding. Therefore, it is widely known as a place for students' school trips.The best tourist season is April 8th in the lunar calendar, but we visit several times a year to avoid the day. The reason is that when you visit here, you can get peace of mind.Beomeo-Temple is a place where you can have both the calmness of your mind and the rest of your body."
"Peaceful, Historic, and Beautiful","This was our second visit to Beomeosa and we were fortunate to be there for their celebration of the 1343d anniversary of the founding of the temple. There was classic and modern entertainment and free meals provided by the temple. All in all, it was a wonderful afternoon. Although the temple grounds are beautiful, the walk up the road to the temple is a highlight of natural beauty and serenity. The natural beauty next to a vibrant metropolis is awe inspiring and typical of the today's Korea."
Amazing place !,"Amazing place great nature around it also beautifull temple, also good for hike. It's a long way up to the temple you should prepare your hiking gear. Once you reach the temple you can enjoy and explore around and if you walk more 2km up there is even more attraction and good nature. You can enjoy 2 things at once beautifull historical place and nature."
Great temple stay visit,"Stayed overnight as part of the G Adventure tour.One of the highlights of the tour. The monks and support staff are great and make a lot of effort to give you a good experience.You get to try meditation, evening prayers, tea ceremony. walk to a smaller local temple early in the morning.Lights out was 2130 and up again at 0500 for meditation.It is possible to have a shower if you are up early enough or go just before lights out.Basic dinner and breakfast but adequate and fits in with the temple stay experience.Take ear plugs in case of snoring in the dormitories. Floors are heated so not cold at night"
Lovely grounds,"A peaceful, meditative spot. We were there closer to the end of the day and it was very quiet, no crowds. This temple is considered one of the top 3 major temples in South Korea.Nice photo opportunities. Surrounding this temple are hiking trails, fresh pine air."
Well worth the visit ,Long climb up the hill but well worth it. Climb up the hill even further to the second lot of temples. It's more quiet and peaceful. Best place to visit in busan. 
Walk and climb to the very top,"This is a stunning place. Ancient, calm and peaceful. Respect it as a functioning centre of faith and enjoy the great views and ancient buildings. Keep climbing up to the very top and take a slow walk back down the mountain along side tumbling water on the broad stepped boardwalk. Very spiritual if there are not too many tourists "
A Must See Attraction,"Unfortunately the day we visited, it was overcast and raining but this didn't stop us from seeing Beomeosa Temple and the weather kept the crowds to a minimum, so bonus! This is a must see historical attraction near Busan and if you are visiting, gives you a great day out, with interesting culture and history. You should allow a few hours to see it all. "
Spiritual...Stunning!!,"Once at this temple and 'experiencing' it, it is easy to see why this temple is so revered. There is a real sense of awe here... firstly from the features of the surrounding grounds, the magnificent architecture and the stunning views. Once, having spent some time there, the 'spirit' of the place takes over. There are intricate designs on the temple buildings, detailed patterns on many statues/paintings, wonderful displays within worshipping areas etc. etc. Then there are the intangibles including a sense of community, a sereneness, a feeling of belonging..... To top all of this off, seeing monks worshipping and carrying out their 'duties' was unexpected but amazing. A smiling acknowledgement of my presence by one of them added to the great experience there."
Serenity in Busan,"Beomeosa is a peaceful and charming temple complex located in the hills/mountains to the north of Busan. Initially dating back to the 4th century, the original temple was rebuilt in the 1600s after Japanese attack and invasion. Today it is a picturesque and calming site at the edge of South Korea’s second largest metropolis. The site is ideal for those interested in history and architecture in this modern city."
Beautiful Temple,Beomosa is Busan's largest temple and very beautiful to see. For small groups you can also arrange for a tour at The Visitors Center as you enter. And the temple they are beautiful trails for hiking and for those who want to get a taste of temple life you can also arrange to do a temple stay and live the life of a monk for a few days.
Best relaxing place in busan,It is a great place to experience Buddhist culture and visit one of the important temples in Busan and same time enjoy Great view and scenery for relaxing.It is also amazing for getting great pictures.
A nice visit,"Great to have visited this temple easy access with MRT and bus...if you need serenity, have a good stroll"
Serene temple,"This place is located on the scenic hilly area in the outskirts of Busan. You need to take a bus or a taxi from the nearest metro station. Its worth a visit to this quiet set of temples and monastery. Tourist buses normally skip this place and local Koreans go to this temple to pray and worship.The monastery also offers meditation stay for local Koreans. There are also many streams during the rainy season, which can double up as a picnic destination. Definitely a must see, if you have a free day at Busan."
Not just a tourist attraction,"Beomeosa is about a 40 minute subway ride from Busan but located in a peaceful mountain setting. It's a working temple in that local Koreans visit to pray and worship and are led in this activity by the resident monks. As such you need to be respectful. Some places have ""No Photo"" signs but this should be practiced in all places where people are following their religious activities. A couple of things to note. When you first arrive visit the museum which off to the right of the Jogyemun Gate (the first gate you arrive at) The exhibits are worth seeing but of equal value is the brochure you can pick up. It is in a number of different languages, explains the various building and also has a mp of the temple complex. If you head up to the right of the complex, following the road to the various mountain walks, there is an amazing display of Buddhas and other holy deities. Probably the most I have ever seen in one place. Overall well worth the visit. The climb to Mt Godanbong is steep, but the views are worth it."
One of the key sights in Busan ,"Read from reviews on here about the bus to catch from the subway station so that was really useful - thank you! A stop away from the bus station so we could combine it with ticket-buying errand. The grounds of the temple are very extensive but quite a few areas were closed due to meditation being in progress. The various shrines and buildings are beautiful. There weren't lanterns when we were there and as the first temple we visited in SK was Bulguksa in Gyeongju, it didn't quite feel as impressive. It did seem amazing to have such a tranquil peaceful place within easy reach of the city centre. "
Temple Visit,The name would already tell what the attraction is.Direction:.. Beomeosa Station.. Exit 5 or 7.. There is a road between the two exits. Walk along the road to find a bus stop (Samsin Bus Stop).. Take bus 90
Tranquil amongst lush greenery,Enjoyed the tranquil and peaceful atmosphere. Saw many people hiking up to the temple. Notice a temple stay facility and nature trails around. Whole place decorated with colourful lanterns as Buddha's birthday on 22 May. Would think it is a good place for meditation retreat. Plenty of nature and lush greenery. Need a private transport to get here and out.
Easy access,Take subway no.1 and get off at Pomosa(Exit no7) and take a bus . A temple in the mountain so the atmosphere is good. Temples were not so old but was beautiful decorated when we visited due to Budha birthday celebration.
Beautiful temple and grounds,"Easier to take the Metro to the end of the line, one station past the Beomeosa station, and then hop on the #90 bus right at the station. Bus runs every 15 minutes. If you get off at Beomeosa station instead, you’re going to have to walk up several blocks to get to the #90 bus stop - and the stop is in an odd location. Fortuitously, the bus happened to be coming when we were looking for the stop, so we saw where it turned and were able to board it. Once the bus lets you off at the Temple stop, about 10 minutes away (15 from the Metro), you’re still going to have to walk up another 10 minutes. We were there when the wisteria were blooming and right before the celebration for the Buddha’s birthday. There were thousands and thousands of multicolored lanterns leading up to the temple and throughout the grounds. Really nice walk thru the wisteria grove. Excellent views from the mountainside towards the city area. Quite a few painted wooden temple buildings and gates. Some signage in English. Free to enter. No food for sale at the Temple."
Beautiful temple,"Beomeosa is a lovely temple complex, worth a visit. It is a bit out of the way and the hike up the hill can be rather steep so I recommend taking the bus up if you aren't looking for a workout. However, if you are, there are hiking trails from the temple to the Fortress and Seokbulsa Temple. The temple would be the prettiest in the spring when all the flowers are blooming."
Amazing views at the top of the mountain,Took a self guided tour here - jumped on the bus from Busan (used google maps to help). Met a South Korean couple who told me the temple gives out free bibimbap lunch everyday from midday so I ate with them and after they invited me to walk around with them. The temple was very beautiful and peaceful. I then hiked up Geumjeong mountain by myself which took around 1.5 or 2 hours. The views at the top are panoramic and breathtaking. No entrance fee for the temple or the mountain. 
We did this on a self guided tour from a cruise ship using the metro -- the temple is about 4km from the metro stop,"From the Busan International Cruise Port, we went north to the Baoshan Temple, accessible from the metro near the end of the orange line, but getting to the ENTRANCE of the temple grounds requires an uphill climb 3 km away from the metro stop, so walking should not be taken lightly. A bus (currently route 90) runs from town to the temple entrance, but I don’t know the cost or where to board the bus. The metro route takes about 45 min each way from Busan Station to the Beomeosa metro stop, so travel time should be taken into account. We used exit stairs 5-7 to leave the metro station at Beomeosa and the just outside the exit stairs was a side street with a sign pointing up to Beomeosa temple to start our journey. Keep going straight up the street until it dead-ends (all uphill), then the sign at the top tells you to go left to get to the temple entrance (another 1.2 km away). The temple is on that road (1km past another small temple also on the road). Restrooms are available at the metro station and some even had a western style toilet. Toilet paper was generally available, but it is always best to bring your own, just in case (along with hand wipes in case soap is not available).The main temple is another 1 km from its entrance gate on the road, but the walk is beautiful as you wander up the hillside past carved stone markers, flowering trees and a nice stream. The temple is one of the largest I have seen. Restrooms and a cafe are available on-site. The grounds alone were worth the stop. We enjoyed our time there before walking back to the metro for our return to the city. The temple does not have a fee to enter, but the metro and buses take only local currency. There was a currency exchange desk in a trailer outside the ship on the pier with a reasonable rate, and we bought day passes for the metro from the vending machine at the station. The temple was worth the trip (both the beautiful grounds and the huge temple)."
Real temple - must visit ,"It’s amazing place with monks praying, kids doing Chinese painting, non stop monks singing on speakers, it’s a living temple. No entrance fee is required unlike in China, Thailand or Bali. Visitors also don’t need to wear sarong. Best place to visit "
Stopped here on our cruise,"We toured this temple as part of our Princess cruise package. It had snowed the night before so it was very slippery. In some areas the snow/slush was 3-4 inches deep and a number of us got wet, cold feet. But the snow added a lot of beauty to this hilltop area. Certainly not suited for anyone with mobility issues. A lot of walking uphill and steps involved."
Nice Temple,Very beautiful. It looks like a village of small temples. Lots of statues in the grounds and quite tiring to get to. A steep hill and several steps make this a bit of a trek. Nice grounds around the temple and also a coffee shop (with slow service) and gift shop.
Popular temple which is worth the journey,"It's a bit complicated to get here as it requires a subway ride and then a bus which isn't very clearly marked...walk a few minutes up a side street, locals will show you the way. Once there it's more walking uphill but there are some picturesque buildings spread out over quite a large area. It seems like a popular place although it certainly wasn't crowded when we visited. Makes a nice break from the city and the temple buildings are atmospheric."
Beautiful,We did a huge walk of about 4 hours to see the fortress begind the boemosa temple and then we ended here. It was a beautiful and big temple ! That also does temple stay if anyone is interested 
Cruise short visit,"Had brief visit on cruise. It had snowed the night before so was slippery, wet, and difficult for older people to walk. Several people fell down. There were western toilets available in rest rooms. Temple had wide variety of beautiful facilities. The snow added a unique beautiful perspective and I understand it seldom snows so this was a treat, but our shoes and socks were wet when we finished. Not suitable for people that lack mobility. Steep paths and steps. Beautiful setting. "
Must do!,One of the most beautiful temple that I visited in South-Korea. I really liked the peace at this place. You can combine the visit with a hike in the fortress nearby.
Good thing takes time!,"This beautiful temple is located on the top mountain. It takes us many stop until we reached the nearest station to the location. You can walk up to the temple by enjoying the view from all the amazing trees that surrounds the mountains from the bottom to the top but I recommend you taking taxi because it’ll takes a pretty long time. When we arrived at the top, we were surprised how beautiful the building were. Although everything was built since long time ago, it looked new as it was just built because of the pretty colors. Every building has it own history and contain it own memory. There’s a prayer temple that people actually comes to pray. This experience is a must go place because all the beautiful maintain and buildings just what we don’t see in our busy city lifestyle."
"A holistic, serene and memorable visit at Beomeosa Temple.","Located in the eastern edge of Mt. Geumjeongsan in Busan and established in 678 the holy and significantly important Beomeosa Temple is one of the major temples in Southeastern Korea and the seat of Seon Buddhism. It was in early fall in early October when me and my family took a private trip to this holy site - public transportation is also available via Beomeosa station. It was a chilly morning and the nature encompassing the temple is lush, green and fresh. You could hear the silence even tough this is a major tourist spot. Not a lot of tourists are there but what amazed me apart from the nature is the activity in the temple - you could still see Monks praying and chanting so this is indeed a holy site. The main hall - Daeungjeon is the most important and delicate structure in the whole complex. Another important landmark is the Seven story pagoda as well as the Treasure 250 - Beomeosa Three Story Pagoda. The temple has many stairs so for those with disability, kids and seniors might have difficulty unless capable. This is also a nature trail so hiking is also available. Before the exit there is a small souvenir items mainly religious if you would like as souvenir. And on the west exit as you traverse you could see a line of plentiful Bamboo grass. On the edge of the west exit near the parking lot entrance there is a 500 year old Gingko Tree which is also one of the treasured historical sites in the complex. Overall I admired the wonder of nature surrounding this temple and it is worth a visit."
Shila art style in Busan,the old temple was build in Shilla era. can go to the temple on the mountain by bus no.90 from Bomoesa station.there have museum and almshouse.
Takes a Bit of Effort to Get Here,"We were staying in Haeundae and took the metro to the Beomeosa stop. It took about an hour. From the metro, you walk to Bus 90 for the 5 minute ride to the temple.Entrance is free. It was very quiet when we went on a Monday morning. The area isn't too large and we walked around for 30 minutes."
Beautiful,Only regret that we didn't visit korea slightly earlier when the trees still had leaves on them! Everything was so beautiful. I would visit in the morning so that you have plenty of time to do the trails. The temple does lunch as well (which was free of charge) but you shpuld probably make a donation too. Bring comfortable footwear because the trails can take up a good 3-4hours (which is why it is good in the morning whilst it is still bright). Defo worth a visit if you're in Busan.
Brief stop over,"The place is too big, not able to roam around. Just make a brief stop over. Just like other temple. Maybe you will really appreciated the place, if you know its history."
Serene Temple in natural surrounding,It is located in a very serene surrounding at the eastern edge of mountains in Busan. The complex is huge. It is open 24 hours and entry is free. There are lot of track routes near the temple. Take Metro Line 1 (Orange) and get down at Beomeosa Station then Exit 7 and walk a bit to a bus stop to catch Bus No. 90 (it starts from there) and get down near the temple (10 minutes uphill drive through the forest)..
Very peaceful,"A nice place to visit even though it does take time and effort to get there. There are some good hikes to do in this area, also the cemetery is very interesting."
Huge temple complex.,We did a tour of the Beomeosa temple complex. There are so many small temples and prayer rooms. The complex is about a 50 minutes bus ride outside Busan in the mountains. The setting lovely and since it was autumn the colours on the hills were fantastic. there were lots of Buddhist monks walking around.
Beautiful Temple with impressive hiking,"An amazing temple complex with access to trails into the hills that seem worth exploring. After you exit the subway station of the same name, walk a short distance up the hill to the stop for the bus which will take you to the temple. A Tip: The bus stop is at a small grocery store, so a quick pit stop for snacks and water is a good idea. Once you get to the temple, it is a multileveled complex well worth giving it some time to be explored. If you want, there are a number of hiking trails which will bring you further into the hills and forest which are worth the time. The terrain is quite steep, however, so please consider your personal fitness. If you are in Busan when the Wisteria are in bloom, there is a Wisteria grove which must be spectacular and worth the visit alone."
Beomeosa Temple,"Beomeosa Temple is a very old and beautiful temple built on the mountain, with both Korean and foreign tourists to experience the beautiful atmosphere."
Very large temple ,"A 2 hour English guided tour of the largest temple in Busan. I learned a lot about the Buddhist religion, thanks to our English tour guide. This was very busy even on a Sunday as far as tourism and worship goes. Monday was very closed off though according to some other friends that went. It was a very informative and beautiful day for a visit. "
Serene beauty,"Well worth the visit. I wish we had read more about it in advance or brought a guide. There was English on the signs but I wanted to learn much more. For example, why are the large colorful figures stepping on people?"
Best Autumn Foliage Scenery,"I came for autumn foliage for Busan. Unfortunately I missed all the available days for mountain hiking day tour organised by local company. However, unexpectedly when I visited Beomeosa Temple, the autumn foliage was truly amazing. There were mixture of green, yellow and red colour leave. When I hiked up, I could view the whole Busan. This was the best autumn foliage view for my trip. "
Beautiful temple with easy access to hiking,"The Beomeosa Temple complex is beautiful and impressive, but the easy access to hiking is also very impressive. There are several trails that lead directly from Beomeosa (just above the Temple), so wear your hiking boots and take your daypack. Take the Metro to the Beomeosa Temple stop on Line 1, and then use the local bus #90 for the last couple of miles (the bus stop is just a short walk up the hill from the Metro). An ambitious person could walk instead of taking the bus, but I'd recommend saving your energy for a hike after touring the Temple. The woods were pretty, and the leaves were changing colors. Very autumnal."
Mountain Top Temple,"This entails hiking after a train ride to the station of the same name get down exit 5 turn left up the slope to take bus no.90 that takes you to the temple precincts .Option is to take taxi and if you are 4 people it nearly costs same Won 5,000.Then some hiking is required so come prepared with water bottle and some food in the mountain trails .Visits to temples and monastery is very soulful ..no pictures allowed inside .Ah..we went to see autumn red leaves but there were none in first week of November ."
Beautiful Mountain Setting,"Rain and coming darkness muted some of the colors decorating these buildings, but the intricate décor could still be admired. The walk up from the parking area on the boardwalk was slick, but you could also use the parallel road. The mountain setting was beautiful and it was worth it to wander among the many buildings. Behind some is a fountain, with water streaming from a bamboo pipe, that our guide explained would make you 10 years younger if you took a drink. Some people were praying inside the temples and we saw a procession of priests/monks walk through the grounds. In the parking lot was a small store selling snacks and souvenirs."
Peaceful ,Take your time. There are hiking trials if you want to explore further. Take some water before hand and maybe a snack if it’s over meal tomes. A working temple that requires you be quiet as meditation was happening in some of them. Gorgeous autumnal colours in the trees
Sense of peace and calm,The travel distance to Beomeosa Temple is very conveniently connected from train and bus service that brings you directly to the temple. We enjoyed the calm environment and the nice landscape. The temple has accomodation for travellers as well. Might be good experience to try. 
Excellent,"After having spent a week touring temples in Japan, this temple was a welcome change. Very different than the Japanese temples, but still very impressive.The climb is a little steep, but the wooden walkway makes it easier. The area is open to the sky with several buildings that are reachable only by steep stairs with no handrails. I was irritated by all the tourists taking pictures when the signs clearly forbade it and each building had several people quite obviously attempting to pray. The bathrooms are a bit of a challenge for Westerners (few stools and several squatters), and not nearly so clean as I had become spoiled by in Japan. No soap or towels, so be sure to bring your own."
Very special,"One of the most special temples in South Korea. Enormous Buddha statues. After you visit the main building, climb up the road (by foot or by car) to watch many more magnificent statues."
Relaxing walk to the temple,"The temple is beautiful and the location is excellent, in the middle of the forest. Arriving to the temple you can take the no. 90 bus and it will take you right to the entrance. Returning from the temple, I recommend walking thru the forest because it is very relaxing. At the botton of the trail there are restaurants which have traditional rice wine. It will make your day."
Great little temple for walkers and couples,Becomes is a picturesque temple with nice walk in the forest and mountains and of course has a stream.Well worth a visit for anyone. As is the case so often in Korea many of the mountain walks and trails start from a temple
"Worth a visit, and free to enter","We were dropped off by car at the top, then later took the no. 90 bus back to the Beomeosa suburb, followed by a short walk to the subway. A nice temple from memory, to be honest after seeing several temples it is hard to remember the specifics of any one temple (hopefully our photo-book will highlight the specifics later!). Slightly steep approach from the bus stop. Temples are peaceful places to visit and this was no exception."
Well worth seeing,"Part of a tour from a cruise ship we were not sure where we were going, but we were pleasantly impressed by this temple. Is very close to the city mountain area, but appreciated having a bus driver to navigate the city traffic. The walk up to the temple was a good gradient but easy due to the design of the boardwalk. Once we reached the temple my fit but older mother found the lack of hand rails a challenge. Our tour guide (from the Princess cruise line) was excellent explaining the temple areas, as well as leavng us time to walk around and take photos"
Real live Monks here,"I turned up at prayer time and all the shrines were full of people and monks chanting along. So interesting to watch, but photos were soo off limits. You are nuts if you try and walk up - take the bus. Out of exit 5 or 7 and then take the road that goes up hill between the exits. At the top of the hill at the junction is a bus shelter clearly marked ""Beomeosa Temple"". Free to enter and wonder round the Temple, there are a few areas that are off limits as they are the monks living quarters. From where the bus drops you there is no food or drink from there to the Temple, but as you walk up to the bus stop plenty of places to top up (even a supermarket close to the bus stop). If you do want to eat up at the temple, then walk back down to the car park and there are lots of street stalls around there."
Good for a quite decent walk ,"You may stop at Beomeosa train station and take bus 90 to the beomeosa Temple. Wear comfortable shoes as you need to walk a little, steep stairs. There's the area where they supply cold mountain water, located behind the temple. "
Unmissable,"Don't leave Busan without seeing this temple.Can be reached by travelling on the subway on the orange line to the stop with the same name (Beomeosa).Get out of the station (exits 5 or 7) and take the road uphill to the end where you'll find a small bus stop. The bus (number 90) there will take you to the entrance of the temple.Easy to see when to get off the bus as most people, especially tourists will get off there."
Peaceful Afternoon ,"With its setting in the hills above Busan, the temple is a great get away from the city crowds. It must be even more picturesque when the leaves change in the fall. Beomeosa is still an active, important temple. There is a peacefulness here in only hearing wind chimes, rustling leaves and your own footsteps. Easy to get to on line 1 metro. Then if you are up for a walk, follow the forested exercise path up (or down) to the temple. There are micro businesses along the way if you want to stop a for some tea or or a snack. Later in the evening, the path becomes crowded with neighbors out walking for exercise. "
"Steep, steep climb . . . Hope you're fit!","Very nice sitting once you get there as I have no issues with the praise from other reviews below. Buddha wanted to test the resolve of his devoted by making them hike to this temple, I believe. Beware uneven stone walkway near the top and then difficult 100 steps to the shrine. Be respectful and bow with hands together to say hello to Buddha before passing the archway. It is also a sign of respect to say good bye in the same manner. Possible Tip: I believe a taxi can drop you closer to the summit. "
A beautiful templex complex in Autumn,"We took Metro line 1 to Beomeosa Station (exit 5) and went through a narrow lane to the back and caught bus No: 90 to Beomeosa Temple. We had some initial problem locating the bus stop and had to ask some locals. It was a slow uphill journey to the temple, but it wasn't far. Entrance was free and we walked around the vast temple grounds, admiring its collection of temples. Autumn leaves were already visible but if we had come in early November instead of late October 2016, I think the autumn scenery would be even more beautiful. As we went in the late afternoon, we had to leave after a couple of hours before it got dark. A serene atmosphere and good place to relax and gather your thoughts. We also saw persimmon fruits which were already ripe."
What a Steep Climb,"This temple is a wonderful sight to see, but be warned it is spread out up a fairly steep hill with plenty of steps. There is a walkway that meanders up the side, but it too is fairly long.There are several small temples on the way to the main site and lots of photo opportunities. It is probably better to go either early or late in the day to avoid the crowds and the humidity."
Amazing complex of temples in stunning mountain site,"Just visited Beomeosa this past Sunday! Feel so lucky to have had the opportunity to do so. While Busan is known for its beaches, shopping and cool vibe, I was really excited to get to see this whole other side to the city. While the temple complex at Beomeosa is way up in the mountains above Busan, it is relatively easy to access via subway (Line no 1.0 - Orange - to Beomeosa stop, exit no 5) and a short bus (no 90) or cab ride (4,800W). The site is really beautiful with many temples that one can visit. I truly appreciated the explanations in English that are sprinkled throughout the site. This really helped to understand the historical and contemporary significance of Beomeosa. We also got to tour the museum that is part of the complex and that was a real eye-opener! Thoroughly enjoyed the varied types of art on display. The natural beauty of the area is stunning as it is nestled in this cool pine forest with mountain streams running throughout. A must-see if you visit Busan."
Walking as an adventure,"Walking the way up to the temple is just a 'must do'. The temple is not very big in comparison with others, but the journey to get there is stunning. I stopped to take pictures almost the whole way. "
Relax and recharge and be polite,"This is a universe unto itself in the midst of the teeming city. Once you enter the gatesyou are in a quiet, peaceful space. Go soon to see the gorgeous lotus garden blooming and the white lanterns hung just overhead as you climb the steps to the main building.Sit quietly near the giant drum and bell as they are beaten and then rung in turn and close your eyes, block out the world and feel refreshed. Keep in mind this is a living temple and services may be going on so speak softly and try not to run up the steps to take selfies and photos of the monks and congregationpraying inside. If you wouldn't do it in Europe, don't do it here. Be mindful and enjoy.Be prepared for uneven ground and some fairly steep steps but be open to the history and beauty of this holy place."
You need to see this. History is what makes Korea,"We enjoyed this place. It is peaceful, scenic and the views were amazing. I am a traveler that believes that you need to see the country, not just the tourist traps. This isnt a trap. it is free and worth your time."
Nice beautiful place,It's a very holy and simple quiet place.Love the interaction with nature.Attached picture shoes how to reach the temple. We were planning to go to north gate but very difficult to go as it's not well directed. There are instructions written but in Korean.. so started but turned back as it was getting dark .Easy to reach via bus . 
Beautiful not touristy,"My wife and I had a few hours before our train and the weather was cloudy and drizzling. We dropped the beach plan and decided to cab to the temple. The cab from Busan train station cost 21,000+ Won. The temple is a large complex of beautiful buildings, many of them shrine rooms. On the Monday morning we went it was very busy, but very few tourists. Many people were there to chant. Each shrine building had numerous people, each room had a monk or priest leading chanting. The temple is on a low mountain surrounded by more of the same. The foggy weather made the temple grounds and mountains a classic Asian art scene. The temple has no tourist plaques explaining anything, underscoring that this is a real functioning religious site and not a tourist trap. There are at least two restroom areas that are clean. There is a large mess hall and visitors who are there at noon can stay for a meal with the many practitioners. The temple is up a long winding road. If you metro or bus you will have to walk up this road - no side walk for most of it. Probably about an hour walk. We took a cab to the temple and then caught a cab back down ( 4,400 Won) but only to the nearest metro which is a direct line back to the Busan train station. We enjoyed this relatively quick trip before catching our train."
Picturesque grand temple - see important directions below,"Uniquely decorated temple compared to other restorations in a wonderful green hillside setting. It is a working temple so you need to be mindful of prayers and meditating. Well worth the visit.Take metro line 1 to station of same name, exit 5 follow the brown sign ""Beomeosa Temple 3km"". After less than 5 minute walk you will see the bus stop/seat for the circular shuttle bus 90 (W1600 each way). Take this as the road is very steep and winding. You will be dropped off at the park entrance, and you can catch the bus back from the same spot when you are finished.Thanks for the vote if you found this review helpful.""How to get to Beomeosa Temple Busan"""
Very tranquil temple,Went there on a weekday. There's rituals going on but the feeling you get is very peaceful and tranquil. 
Worth a visit,"Wonderful weather in June. Tranquility , peaceful, Calm and ""Silent"". Worth the visit in Busan. Trekking downhill is advisable. "
Unexpected beauty and peace,"It is one of the best temples I have seen. You take the bus 90 from Beomeosa subway station and get to this lovely lush mountain location. If I had known I would have stayed the night, you can do a ""temple stay"", which must be memorable. "
"nice temple, can also sleep or stay for the night to meditate","great temple, you also get cardio exercise since you hike up this templebus service available no. 90easily accessible to touristsnot much tourists heregood place to pray and meditate"
Good temple stay experience,"I joined the temple stay program with a group of friends in Mid-May 2017. The guide, Pamela, was professional and offered clear and easy to follow English translation. There were two to three other volunteers who helped to make our stay enjoyable. The program involved a 2hr hiking and it was a great way to explore the greenery of Busan! The outline of the temple stay program is available on the temple's english website and I don't want to spoil the fun by sharing too much details here. Overall, temple stay offer you a taste on the monastic lifestyle of Korean Budhhism and a getaway from the busy city lifestyle."
"Not grand, not awesome","Though this temple is built on mountain, but it is not grand or awesome as you thought. Please do take a taxi from after coming out from Beomeosa Station, it cause me 5000won per way. Its quite difficult to walk up the hill unless you really prepare for hiking. The temple is quite small and not really grand. It is really too out of the way. If your trip is rush, can skip this place."
A special place,"A large temple complex situated in the mountains out of the city and is a must see tourist attraction. However, bear in mind that this is not a museum it is an inhabited and working Buddhist shrine and should be respected as such. There are lots of different buildings to see and the architecture is magnificent. The surrounding countryside is also peaceful and tranquil.There are a lot of steps to negotiate and an uphill hike from the parking lot where the tour buses drop off. So this is not suitable for people with mobility issues."
Amazing Temple,We were here on Buddha's Birthday so the temple grounds were crowded and were filled with celebrating people. The entire temple area was festooned with lanterns created a most colorful glow as the sun reflected off of them. The views beyond the temple to the surrounding mountains are fantastic. The 1 hr climb up the mountain path was a bit strenuous for a 74 year old- and a 69 year old couple- but was doable and very worth while.
Amazing. My first Buddhist temple. So beautiful.,"Not difficult to get to but still relatively isolated, this was a beautiful and fascinating experience. We wish we got a tour to learn more about Korean Buddhism, which we found out is relatively unique. Awesome architecture and statues, it's still frequented by pious Buddhists who are there making supplications."
Cool temple,Pretty easy to get to. The temple is lovely and has a lot of gates and relaxing atmosphere. The large Buddha is really cool. I think there is a traditional tea ceremony in there but the line was too long for us.
Under renovation. ,Not wheelchair accessible and not much to see as part of it is under renovation. The surrounding park is good for hiking and is quite serene. 
Pretty but under construction,"Yes, it was a long way from Haeundae, train to the last stop and then change to bus 90 (5 min walk from the train station to bus station). I wouldn't walk up the hill, it was a long way, I recommend to take the bus. A few houses/ temples were under construction when I was there but the area is really pretty. So many lanterns and it's really peaceful and relaxing. If you have time I recommend to visit this temple, but I only spent 30 mins there. So it basically took me longer to get there :-)"
Peaceful temple,The temple is high in the mountain and a long way from the city of Busan. It is very peaceful and really beautiful temple with many lanterns on both sides of the street lead to the entrance of the temple. We were lucky to be able to view the cherry blossoms around the temple. Highly recommended.
Very beautiful temple surrounded by nature,"Beautiful temples and landscape, lots of bamboo and cherry blossoms during spring, also the lanterns give off a special vibe"
Beautiful Setting,"Went here as part of a day tour on a super rainy day. It's quite peaceful and scenic--cherry blossoms nearby. Note: there is a restroom (toilet) near the parking lot, and there are no food stands like at Haedong Yonggungsa Temple. There is a souvenir shop."
Take your camera!,This is a long way out the city but very easy to get to if you use the public transport! Don't be scared to use it and ask for help. You take the train to the LAST station and then the number 90 busy directly to the temple. Simple!If you don't plan to hike or walk around the ground you would probably be done in about 30 minutes.
A very nice temple complex enveloped by mountains,"There're many ways to get there. We styed near Metro line 1 so it's very easy for us. We took line 1 and alighted at Beomeosa station, exit 5. Look for Beomeosa temple sign and go to that direction. After the exit of metro, turn right and walk back a bit to an uphill street, walk for 3 minutes to small bus station. Take bus 90 to the temple (the last bus in the day is at about 20.00) so please watch your plan. We've been there quite late in the afternoon when it's getting dark but the scenery's stil spectacular."
Highly recommend!,"Picturesque temple that sits on a mountain. Absolutely loved this place!! Went there on a nice cooling spring afternoon. Absolutely breathtaking views and tranquil ambience. A treat for those seeking a quiet respite away from the city. How to get there: Beomeosa station (orange line; found the subway Korea app to be very convenient throughout the trip), exit 5/7 (they're side by side), turn into street between the 2 exits and head upwards until you reach a bus stop with a sign that says bus 90 Beomeosa temple. You can pay for the ride with T Money card. It's a ~15 min bus ride; scenic views (would really recommend walking up although it may be a bit challenging; alternatively take the bus up and walk down). Take in the peace and quiet, offered respects to the deities. continued exploring the temple grounds and found a little sandy road that lead to a carpark. Just a little further up I found the signs of the trails to the top of the mountain. It's a pity we arrived late for it would have been an absolute treat to walk up the various trails! Went about halfway up one of the trails (requires some fitness but doable as the stone steps are well defined). I think there's the option of doing temple stays here as well. Would come back in a heartbeat and spend an entire day here exploring the trails!!! Great for those who love walking amidst beautiful nature! :) Going to pencil this in for my next trip to Korea!!! "
Beautiful place,"Must visit the temple .it is one of the place to visit in busan .easy to reach by bus , take sub way then bus will take you temple .half day visit is awesome ."
Place very exotic for every European,"Very picturesque surroundings. Exotic for European buildings.Slightly crowdly place.One big drawback is lack of English descriptions or guides, so it is difficult to find meaning of this arrangement."
A grand size temple with history and lots of bamboo trees,"I was pleasantly surprized by the size and beauty of this temple. It was quite a walk around the temple, so you need to wear comfy shoes. Main buildings are nice but I enjoyed little pagodas, bamboo bushes, and old walls with moss in the higher side of the temple. I felt as if I were walking in the middle of Arashimaya near Kyoto. "
Excellent outing in Busan.,"Beomeosa Temple Pronounced as Bomosa. It is an old temple in the mountain that attracts lot of people especially the locals during weekend. Worth a visit. If you are game enough, you can follow the trails for some mountain trekking. I just want to share with you how to reach the place.First, take subway and alight at Beomeosa Station.Get out from Exit 5 or 7.Take the road in between Exit 5 and 7 leading up the slope for about 200 meters to a covered bus stop for Bus 90.Take Bus No 90 and just follow the crowd to the entrance to the temple."
Arrive from Oncheongung,"Take the Oncheongung cable car to the top of the mountain. Then go on a super hike for nearly 8km along the top of the mountain ridge. Enjoy a view of the sea and the city below the whole way. Lots of amazing places to eat with open air restaurants. Follow signs, and you can end your hike in Beomosa Temple."
Interesting Temple Site,"Wandered around one beautiful fall afternoon. It's old, but still in use. There were a lot of students there and apparently they have weekend and week-long experience Buddhism"
Beautiful temple in the mountains,"We took the metro to the Beomeosa stop and then a taxi to the temple. There is a bus, which we took down from the temple. You can walk to it but it is an uphill walk. Once you get to the temple, it is in the mountains, with a lovely stream running through it. Lots of old and restored buildings for prayer, beautiful statues and a nice gift shop with 3 of the loveliest ladies. We walked up to the golden Buddha statue, which is not to be missed. All in all, this was a very lovely way to spend the morning. The monks do not like pictures to be taken, so there are signs around asking no photography. Respect this because this is a temple. "
Mountain Temple very rustic and historic.,This temple is up in a mountain and still lots of walking even though the temple ground is not too big. Very ancient temple with beautiful architecture and the place is very windy yet tranquil. You can reach by taking subway line 1 and alight at Beomeisa Station exit 7 turn right and walking further ahead on the left you will see an uphill road. Follow the road up for a good 5 mins you will pass by eateries and there is a bus stop outside a supermarket. Take bus 90 direct to the temple. 
Beautiful views………wear good walking shoes,"Please wear good walking shoes or even hiking type shoes. The first set of temples have placards explaining the history. You can even sign up in advance to stay in the temple as a meditation retreat. There is a path off to the far left of the temple that takes you up a hill/mountain called the sea of rocks that will lead you to another set of temple prayer and living quarters. If you continue up the path, that gets slippery and a little steep, it will lead you to an even more beautiful view than that which you have already had the pleasure of experiencing."
Quite a hike," First time in Korea, and we loved the markets and street food, but we also wanted to see the historical side of Busan. As people said, definitely worth the visit! We decided to walk from Beomeosa station after seeing the ""3km"" sign. We had no idea it would be a hike up (we are not seasoned hikers) It was drizzling and we had on the wrong shoes (sneakers recommended) but we found a nice trail by the river halfway up. It was easy to imagine how beautiful it would be in spring/autumn. It was foggy when we went, which created a mystic atmosphere especially with the mountains. Worth the walk, and the temples are beautiful. Do take water with you though, if you're walking.  It is a sacred place of worship open to everyone, hence no pamphlets or signs explaining the history or meaning of carvings and structures; pre-study needed if that is your interest. If you're not walking, take bus no. 90 (1300krw/person, you pay cash when you get on) which seems to come twice every hour?? The bus stop is up the hill, not on the main road after exiting the station. The bus drops you off at the foot of the path leading to the temples. There are bathrooms if you walk down just past the tour-bus parking. "
Excellent tour of history,Although snow covered this tour was very interesting for someone who travels all of the time but rarely takes the time to sight see. 
Busan's Top Attraction of Tranquility,"Well worth travelling to this oasis of calm on the Northern edge of S Korea's second biggest city. Visited using metro (Line 1 to Beomeosa Station - Exit 5 or 7) and local bus.(Number 90). You have to walk up the hill to find the bus stop and it can be quite popular. Buses are every 15-20 minutes. Again, there is a little more uphill walking to get to the temple at the other end - but it is worth the walk. English speaking visitors can take advantage of the Templestay programme which allows people to experience the life of a Buddhist monk for a day or two/three day duration. Temple food is vegetarian, early morning rises for prayer/meditation and treks around the environs of the temple - a chance to get away from the stress of modern living. It is recommended that you book at least a month in advance so that an English speaking guide is available. Beomeosa can get quite busy over the weekends so maybe better to escape the crowds by visiting during the week. Many of the visitors are active elderly people who are well kitted out to hike about the countryside trails surrounding the temple."
Quite colorful and ornate structures,"It was November 14th, and the hills were totally alive with fall color, which added to the beauty. Very colorful temples on site. Not worthy of a long visit."
Tranquil spot,"Went up here on a very hot day but what I discovered which is quite popular here is picnics on the rocks by a little stream flowing from uphill. Very peaceful place and the view is gorgeous. Also if you love nature, you are literally in the middle of it. There's a bus from downtown bringing people to the Temple. Worth a visit! Bring a good book to read and some snacks! "
Nestled in a mountain :),"Nicely nestled in a mountain setting along a slope on the east side of Geumjeong Mountain is this temple with its buildings ""modest"" in their outward appearance (but then all temples in northeast Asia, meaning in Japan & Korea, are of such nature with ""few exceptions"" such as Fushimi-inari & Kinkakuji in Japan unlike their ""glittering"" counterparts in southeast Asia); but do go into those modest-looking buildings of this temple, and you'll see in them golden Buddha statues along with some other beautiful & colorful sculptures and wall paintings which I was ""kind of"" pleasantly surprised by. What impressed me most here though is not the beautiful displays inside the buildings (they did to some degree) but the beautiful mountain sceneries in all directions which in my opinion make ""peacefulness"" the hallmark of this temple; and yes to add to that peaceful environment, there was also no big crowd here (unlike at Haedong Yonggung Temple on the seaside that I'd visited before coming here) at the time of my visit back in June although I'm not sure if that's usually the case.If coming from Busan Station (after arriving by train), it's quite convenient to get here by taking the subway Line 1 from Busan Metro Station (right beside the train station) to Beomeosa Station followed by an uphill bus ride from the bus station next to a roundabout about a 5-minute walk from the station (about two left turns after coming out of the station to get to the bus stop); once arrived at the bus stop above, it's just about another 5-minute walk to the first gate of the Temple from which you'll go through three more gates (the last gate, actually being a building with a ""meditation hall"" in it, is where you'll have to go through under the building to get to the main temple grounds on the other side of the building). I think some people choose to walk up the mountain from the area of the metro station (Beomeosa Station) instead of taking the bus, but I would say that might be a ""somewhat arduous"" walk judging from the road that I saw coming up; the bus ride on the other hand only takes like a little over 5 minutes."
Nothing much,"good for strolls around, nothing much..just a few temples around the place.went there during autumn, the scenery was nice...maples leaves everywhere.from Beomeosa station take a bus to the temple."
Location is far but good scenery,Nice scenery to go during Autumn! Maples leaves can be seen there.. small temple though.. nothing much about temples.. main thing is scenery is nice!
"Not so special, except the free lunch","We went hiking and chose Beomeosa Temple as the starting point. It provides free simple vegetarian free lunch every afternoon. Taste is okay, but it is a good experience. Remember to wash your own bowls before leaving"
Needlessly stunning ,"If you want to see something traditional place in Busan, which is mainly focused on modern and cutting edge culture, this place is totally worth it. Take a bus (1300won in cash for one way) from Beomeo-sa station and get off. You can see old and stunning view"
Not impressed,"Nice enough temple, but boring compared to its Japanese counterparts, and without the same serene surroundings. However, it is a very nice starting point for a walk, so drop by if you are in the area anyways."
Meditating and relaxing outing,"I took subway to Beomosa station (Line 1). The direction to bus stop no. 90 is not visible after you exited from the station. Anyhow, I found the directional sign and the bus stop after looking to and fro the surrounding. Certain areas at the temple is undergoing restoration work. The scenery (with autumn foliage) is beautiful. There are hiking trails and many senior citizens were in their hiking attire for their hiking expedition. Nothing to wow but it is indeed a very relaxing and good experience if you have not been to a Buddhist Korean temple."
Uphill hike,"'Need to be in rubber shoes to visit this place. To reach the area, uphill strides are required. It's quite far from the bus stop. I don't recommend going here if you are not in good shape or is incapable of long walks likewise to the elderly tourist. Take metroline 1, get off at Beomeosa Stn. Exit 5. After the exit, go back a bit and take the next left going uphill until you reach the station which takes you to bus 90 station. Get off at Beomeosa. "
nothing interesting,"To be honest, I was a little disappointed with the visit. read the description online and was looking forward to it. The surroundings were breath-taking, with the beautiful trees taking in the seasons and all. But as a temple, it's nothing fascinating. there were only a few statues and the bell towers were closed to the public. For rhe distance travelled, it is not quite worth rhe effort. Good for strolls though."
Beautiful maple trees,"We had a lovely visit in early November, mostly due to the gorgeous maple trees surrounding the area. It was fairly easy to get to from Seomyeon, but a longer subway ride so best if you can find a seat on the subway. We walked for about 2 minutes uphill after exiting the subway and saw the large bus stop with a big ""90"" written on the wall. It's a bus that loops around the area. The ride was quick and we got off at the Beomeosa Ticket Station. The actual site is not large, with some beautiful monuments before the first gate. The main temple was quite nice, but the highlight was definitely the surrounding area with colourful fall trees and lovely birds.Great place to go for a nice walk near nature."
Beautiful maple trees,"The site was very easy to access from Beomeosa Station, just take the #90 bus which loops around the area, get off at the Beomeosa Ticket Station, and you are there! We were very lucky when we visited on Nov 10, as the maple trees were all changing colors and the view from up top was magnificent! It's not a big area, a few gates, a museum (closed when we went) and the main temple. The lovely lady in the info centre told us that architectural students from all over South Korea come here for inspiration and see traditional Korean architecture.The down side is without a tour guide, there's limited information on the structures, only the basic signs. We would have liked a bit more history information.On our way down we saw many people walking down the mountain through a serene trail. Seems like a popular hiking spot for locals. "
Quite ordinary,"In terms of temples in Korea and around Busan, this one was pretty ordinary feeling but very busy. Lots of people seem to visit and a bit of an incline to get to the main grounds. Still quiet and you could buy a tile for 10,000KRW to write on and donate to the temple. Definitely not as impressive as some of the other temples around Korea."
"Simple, quite ,nothing","Our 1st stop at korea. Go down at nopo station , no.90 bus just right at the gate.nopo station is the bus station. easy than take at beomeosa station.we go at weekdays, around 1pm. Colorful Lantern are beautiful, but beside that, others part is empty, nothing much to walk around except pray. "
"Small, not realy interesting for us. ","The weather was bad & due to the rehab of the place, 1/2 of the temple was close. Compare to many temples in Japan or China, this one look like a joke ! We spent there 30 minutes (but it took us 1hour to go & 1 hour to come back !)Except to go praying, or for the peacefull of the place, I still don't know why going There "
Beautiful lanterns,"I didn't plan to visit this temple. But during my visit, May 2016, there is a Buddhist festival. My korean friend told me to visit because the temple is light up with colourful, beautiful lanterns. We hurriedly went there to catch the last bus. Initially the bus driver didn't want to get us there because according to him the temple is already close but let us because we really came all the way there just for that. Even when he arrived, the guy at the counter also told the same, but let us in for free, as it is already closing time. The bus driver told us he will come again to picked us in an hour as that is his last trip for the day. Got to see the the lanterns, very beautiful, worth the visit! Thankful to the nice korean workers, staff. It is very beautiful! Sorry, unable to attach pics here."
"Good temple to visit, Peaceful area","This temple was recommended to us by some locals we met, as we also wanted to climb the mountain Godanbong above the temple. Entry is free and there is a bus that can take you there from the nearby Beomeosa subway station which costs W1300 each way. This was the first temple we visited in Korea but we were impressed. There is also a small museum within the temple complex which is also free to enter. If you are feeling fit, the hike up Mt Godanbong above the temple is worthwhile, but takes up to 2 hours each way."
Worth the visit if you are passing by,"After visiting many other temples in South Korea this one isn't remarkably special compared to the others. There are some details which differ such as the first entrance gate with pillars made of stone instead of wooden. The scenery is nice and the English information is very clear. We happened to be there at time the free lunch was provided (11.40hr). Having read the comment in one of the reviews, we stand to wait in line for the kitchen. When it's your turn you pick up a bowl and this will be filled with (in our case) Bimbimbap. After finishing you clean your own dishes. The dining hall and the food are nothing special but if you are up for it (or just like a free lunch) it's an experience. "
a working buddihist temple,There are many subtemples this complex which represent different aspects of Buddha. Going with a tour guide helped us understand what is going on. Even with a parking lot dropoff it is a large uphill climb for those with difficulties.
Beautiful and tranquil,"It is a place worth visiting whilst in Busan. I took a taxi there but then found out that there was a cheaper way to go there. Go by subway to station 133 (Beomeosa) on Line 1 and from Exit 7 walk back a little and then turn right into a lane which takes you to shuttle bus no. 90; it takes you to Beomeosa Temple. In spring one could see cherry blossoms and magnolia trees. There is a beef restaurant in the lane, handy if you feel hungry."
Very cold at winter,When you go there in winter you will feel the fresh air and it will be very cold here because its located in the top. I have a nice trip here in this temple. So peaceful and traditional
A beautiful Buddhist Monestry high on a mountain side.,"Certain guide books describe this temple as a highlight of a visit to Busan. And it certainly is. An extremely beautiful complex of gates and buildings with monks chanting, many people meditating and making prostrations to Buddha and other objects of veneration. There setting is worth a visit in addition to the Buddhist experience. Certainly a wonderful place."
Serene temple away from city,A serene temple with good scenery away from the city. Public transport can be used to reach this place but probably not worth the time if u are not a religious person.
Serene place to relax and chill,Love this place as it's quiet yet filled with the sound of nature. We sat along the river and feel the cooling water flowing through our feet. It's a nice place to spend your time and enjoy the serenity. You could also trek up the top and we missed this chance. Just notice they provide some type of short term lodging in the temple. A good place to stay if you like nature and love trekking (:
I enjoyed it for the natural scenery around the temple,"I only went here as a starting point for my hike up Geumjeongsan Fortress, and even when I'm already starting off late for my hike, I still wasn't able to resist the charm of the place. I tried to skim through the area but still ended up spending 40 mins looking around. Before entering the main gate, there's a trail on the left leading to the ""Wisteria Habitat: a grove of some 6,500 wisteria"", I took that trail even if it was winter. I still enjoyed it, it was a beautiful, quiet forest with tall trees. There was even a group of Ahjummas having a picnic by the stream. There's quite a few forks in the trail but it just goes around to where you started. I have no idea what wisterias are but I bet that place is even more beautiful in spring :DI got there by riding the Metro Line 1 (orange), and getting off at Beomosa station, exit 5 or 7. Walk for a bit until you see the bus terminal (you won't miss it), ride bus no.90 towards Beomeosa. :)"
Quiet but not a huge amount to see,"It’s worth visiting but don’t expect anything truly amazing. The site isn’t very large or very crowded either so it's easy to walk around. You can take the easy path back down instead of the bus; follow the road down and after a short while you’ll see a path on the left, next to a stream. Go all the way until you reach a main road, turn left and then right at the junction, walk 200m down the street for Beomeosa station.Take the 1 metro line towards Nopo and get off at Nopo, which is just one stop further than Beomeosa. It’s easier here as the 90 bus stop is just on the left as you leave the platform, and you’ll get a seat on the bus, unlike the crowd who get on two stops later, having walked 200m from the station."
A serene place...!!,"Beomeosa Temple is a must visit when visiting Busan. A quite, serene place to be and meditate among monks."
Beautiful surroundings and temples,"Surrounded by a forest, numerous beautiful active temples. People praying in each one with drums beating. Easy access by public transportation. Worth the hour ride to get there."
Beautiful peaceful place,This is a moving place to visit and well worth the tip out from Central Busan - which we did by taxi. There are several halls to see and the setting is wonderful. You can also join in the chanting as long as you respect local traditions (no shoes n the temple and respectful behaviour) and even stay there if you book ahead. Refreshingly uncommercial although we did buy a roof tile inscribed with our wish/prayer to help with the fabric.
Take a challenging hike over Geumjong mountain to this amazing temple!,"My friends and me, we hiked over Geumjong mountain in Geumgang park (get off at Oncheonjang subway station to get there) to the Beomeosa temple. The hike is very recommendable! Amazing views over whole Busan and a at times challenging walk, you need to walk up and down the mountains. I would only recommend the hike to sporty people. If you need further information about the hike, leave a comment below. More than happy to answer.The temple itself is really big and beautiful. Several buildings are there. Enjoy your stay there. Wifi can also be found there."
Original,"We went in September.. scenery is not as breathtaking as autumn but the temple is worth visit for it's originality. The courtyard and steps are covered with only sand and stones. The buildings, arches are old ancient design, very original. "
So peaceful,Not as busy as any of the other temples I went to. Super quiet and amazing nature surrounding! I just stayed extra time because it was so calming compared to the bustle of Busan
Must read,Perfect place for hiking with cool weather. There is a proper walking track to the temple. Do not use the main road to walk up hill (2.5 km). Do not drink the raw water from the mountain. I had diarrhea after consuming the water.
It is supposed to be South Korea's biggest temple.,"We were told this is South Korea's biggest temple With 65 buildings, but I am sure that I did not see that many buildings. But the temples are old With beautiful wooden details in Nice colours. We did not see that many monks there. A very Nice and calm atmosphere. It is situated far from Busan!"
Breathtaking,"There's a lot of temples there, there are also some monks praying there. You can walk there by hiking, or by taxi. It is quite a long path walking up there. But when you ride taxi, fasten up your seatbelt, the taxi goes really fast. "
Temple Visit,"It's a big temple. Should go during autumn. Because it is on top of hill surrounded by forest. Easy to find, subway+bus"
Beautiful temple,"Far from city. Need a transit from train to bus to get here. Free entrance! Not a big temple but beautiful indeed! Located within nature, do be prepare to walk uphill (just a little bit). We were able to witness prayers during our visit."
Beautiful !,"Although a fair way out, using the metro and a No.90 bus this temple is well worth a visit. Being a fair way up, the air was very refreshing"
Quaint Temple,"The temple is set against a hill with many trees and when I went, there was a slight drizzle and the additional mist made the place more serene. Spent about half an hour there. I took a cab there from the subway. You can easily grab a cab out by waiting at the carpark area when incoming passengers drop off. "
Peace in mind for such visit,"You may take Subway line one (orange Colour) to beomeosa station and take exit 7 and make u turn and u will see a junction (in between exit 7 and exit 5), cross the road, Turn Right"" at the junction and you will see a 7-11 at your left, walk along the street for 100 to 150 metres, there is a junction, cross the road and there is a bus stop at your left hand, you can wait the bus to Beomeosa temple there! After alighting at the Beomeosa temple bus stop, you need to walk abt 15minutes to reach the temple. Along the way, you can see a lot of local people picnic there. You can do praying, donations, as well as buying some souvenirs there. I bought some nice praying incense sticks. "
Good,"One of the things that every traveller to Busan have to see. Not only is the temple very beautiful, but also the surroundings. Add a good guide to tell you the history."
Temple complex AND NATURE,"Really great idea for an afternoon - even a cloudy/rainy one! People praying in some halls, a museum and beautiful sceneries!"
Stunning,"We visited so many beautiful temples and shrines when we were in Asia, all beautiful but this rates in my top few. "
"1,300 year old Buddhist Temple","I loved the gorgeously painted designs on the temple gates and buildings. The Beomeosa Temple once housed over 1,000 monks. We watched monks pray and beat a huge gong. It feels very peaceful here, in the midst of an evergreen forest."
"Nice Temple, hike was the highlight","Beautiful temple in a great atmosphere, but the highlight of the trip to Beomeosa was the hike to Geumjeongsan Peak. It is a moderate hike and in the end you are rewarded with amazing views. I recomend stopping at the tourist booth on the way to Beomeosa Temple and get a map."
Serene and beautiful surrounding,"To reach Beomeosa Temple, take metro to Beomeosa Temple Station from Busan, then bus #90. A short walk from the bus stop to reach the temple complex. There are several temples and buildings in the complex. A serene and beautiful ground and a nice walk around. This is also amid the hiking trail in Mt. Geumjeongsan. The temple offers simple vegetarian meal to visitors for free. Wash the bowl and cutlery after the meal so that other visitors can use them when arrive. Coffee machine for free as well."
1300 yrs old temple,Temple is at the top of the hill.we took bus no 90 and paid 2600 won for two adults.alternatively you can also take a taxi from the train station which will be about 3000 won.we wanted to experience public transport.when we got down from the bus stop we walked to the top and we could see waterfalls.love the beautiful architecture of the temple.
Quiet meditation,"I loved this temple, climbing up the stairs and slowly discovering all the different buildings in the mountain. I took the subway line 1, up to Beomeosa station. There take the exit 7, but be sure to take the first road on the left (between exit 5 and 7) so you can find the bus stop for bus 90. Otherwise, you might turn around like I did.A lot of people were meditating and praying, giving to the place a quiet and serene atmosphere."
""" Beautiful and Really peaceful ""","korean templeYou leave the city, take the Metro to Beomeosa station.  Then you can bus No. 90, taxi or walk up the mountain to the temple.This is one of my favorite spots in Pusan.This quiet temple with little tourist but lots of  traditional Korean colors and architecture. I also walked up the trail in the back a bit and  had the temple lunch (food is simple but free). I felt very much cleansed after the visit. If you are curious about culture and Buddhism, this place is for you.And If you want to clear your mind, live as the Buddhist, be at peace, come here.  I recommend the temple stay.It's great experience in your life!!! I'm glad I saw it and recommend it as one of the wonderful places to visit in Busan. "
"Beautiful temple, worth the exercise!","Korea has many temples but this has to rate among my top three. Lovely and serene, with the possibility of taking loads of photos, and of course there's always the bus back down if needed!"
Beautiful!,Absolutely worth it! Take subway to Beomeosa then bus 90. Taxi costs under 5000 won so is also a good option. The temple complex is impressive.
Really peaceful,"A peaceful place! You leave the city, take the Metro to Beomeosa station. Then you can bus No. 90, taxi or walk up the mountain to the temple. I walked! There is a wonderful footpath,away from the roads, along the side the mountain stream that takes you all the way up to the temple. Hard to find the start of the footpath from the Metro station but worth it! About 3km. Then the usual Buddhist peacefulness, calm, statues, really good! If you want to hike further then many paths to follow."
Spiritual experience,"If you want to clear your mind, live as the Buddhist, be at peace, come here. I recommend the temple stay, but take it with a grain of salt. Enjoy buy don't forget your values. Great overall experience! "
A beautiful temple,"This really was a lovely, serene experience where you leave the city and end up feeling like you are in the mountains with lines of monks and nuns going about their daily routines. Really beautiful. "
Low gates,"Sitting on a hill north of the city, the access to this temple is not easy. We took a cab here. The low gates of this temple are unique...at least for us as we have not seen any others of similar design.Guess I would recommend a visit here if one have a morning to spare."
Beautiful Scenery right out of a movie,"This temple is by far one of the more interesting and serene ones I have been to. Great activity for a sunny day. Also quite easy to get to, assuming you know how you're getting there. Best way is to take the Subway to Beomeosa station and take exit 5. Once out, turn around, you'll see a sign pointing to beomeosa temple (3KM). follow that sign up the road, where you will find the number 90 bus that can take you to the temple.There isn't a lot of english explanations, but that's nothing a simple google search can't fix."
Recommend to get a taxi going!,"Get the fresh air and worth a visit. It's a bit far away from the Busan central, but if you're staying in Busan for longer period, you can try to visit Beomeosa Temple. Please try to get the taxi for going up when you arrive to the metro station. Going down from the temple (downhill) is walkable but it will take you 30-45 minutes to do so."
A great getaway from the city..enjoyed the trail and temple lunch!,"This is one of my favorite spots in Busan. I was there in end of April during my second visit to Busan and was gladly surprised by this quiet temple with little tourist but lots of traditional Korean colors and architecture. I also walked up the trail in the back a bit and had the temple lunch (very simple but free). I felt very much cleansed after the visit. If you are curious about culture and Buddhism, this place is for you."
A peaceful cultural experience.,"Beomeosa is a beautiful experience on so many levels. The architecture and artwork are stunning, the accessible trails and hermitages provide spectacular views, and the monks and staff are truly kind and generous. Spend some time in meditation for a soul satisfying visit.The temple is truly a worthwhile stop for any visitor. It's easy to access via train and a short walk up the hill to the bus. It does require a lot of uphill walking and stairs but it's well worth the experience. Bathrooms are readily available. You can take the bus back down the hill, or walk for a fun food stall experience."
"Nice view, nice architecture, lots of stair.","After exit beomeosa temple st, if you go with 3-4 ppl better use taxi and drop at parking. And you can use stair to downhill. If like hiking maybe can prepare to hiking beside temple there a path to hiking.. prepare for bus stop no 90 take a long time to down"
A good hike that pays off when you reach the top,"Situated on a tall hill, this temple is best accessed with a vehicle unless you have good fitness and a lot of time to walk uphill. Easily accessed by bus from the bus terminal at the nearby town. The hike starts from where the bus stops and you will be greeted by soothing greenery and ancient architecture. This temple is very well-maintained and you get to sit in their shrine halls to either meditate or pay respects. A wonderful place to visit when in Busan and definitely a top-ten. Make some time to also hike through the trails around the temple."
Mountain top treasure,"Had some extra time on a business trip and the company we were visiting took us here to see the temple. Just the ride up the mountain in the car was outstanding. Compared to other historic sites I have visited, the tourist traffic was very moderate, so it made for a pleasant walk around the grounds. The setting is very peaceful and serene and views from the mountain were tremendous. There was no charge to get in, and you can get a free map of the site in English near the entrance to the main temple area."
Beautiful temple,It is a ideal place for cultural and historical lovers. You can see many locals praying together with monks. Free entry fee. 
Great place to see,"Not horribly busy or packed and was very nice to see. Seemed more authentic than other places. No photos allowed inside the individual temples, but plenty of things to photograph."
Peaceful walk - worth gg ,"Beomeosa Temple is one of the nicer and serene temple to visit in Busan. It was raining on the day I went, but the rain didn't ruin anything - the walk to and around the temple was peaceful and nice. It was not as crowded as some other temples in korea which was a plus plus point. Easy to navigate to the temple. There are several hiking routes around which didn't get a chance to try (didn't plan for a hike that day) I'll probably plan for it the next time I visit korea. "
Nothing Special,A bit disappointed after travelling so far to the temple. Very normal temple that you will find in many parts of Asia. 
Serene,"I must say this is one of the highlights of my visit. Nestled in the mountains, it was about and hour's taxi ride from BFF Square.There is a festival going on, thus the whole temple is decorated with colourful lanterns. A beautiful sight. There was also a massive praying session going on when we reach. Was of a big scale. The architecture was intricate. I liked it that there are different levels in the temple due to the gradient of the ground. So there are a lot of surprises as you explore the temple. As the temple is facing the mountains, it was quite an experience standing in the premises of the temple, admiring the view and enjoying the cool breeze. The temple's premises are well conserved. Great to see a piece of history. At the back of the temple, there is a outlet where spring water was carried down from the mountains. The locals came to drink and wash their face with the spring water. Beside the temple, there is a woods beside it where you can explore. There are streams also. Can spend half a day at the temple to soak in the serenity. Highly recommended. "
Worth visiting,"They are too many temples in Busan, so we decided to visit two. Once at seaside and one at hillside. Beomeosa temple is at the hillside and its one of the famous temple compare to the rest. For temple lover, this is a must"
Quite nice though is not superb,"Quite nice place but not superb. I came during holiday so it's pack with people. Can't say much if you compare the temple architecture in Japan. Good thing is I came during lampion festival so a lot of colorful lampion was there, try to make a wish guys!"
Temple Stay,"We just spent almost 24 hours on a Saturday night temple stay at Beomeosa. It was fabulous. Our group of 22 consisted of 14 Koreans and 8 English speakers. We were given comfortable clothing to wear for the duration and guided through some of the Korean Buddhist practices by a monk and other temple staff. Our visited culminated in an early morning 3 hour hike to the top of the mountain to the site of the pool where a golden fish was found swimming which gave the mountain and temple their names. We saw some of the ""regular"" hikers heading up while we were on our way down. This was a great was to visit the temple, hike the mountain and get a little bit of Korean and Buddhist history and culture."
Beautiful temple complex in the mountains,"Beomeosa is truly one of the main highlights in Busan. The temple complex is surrounded with mountains, the natural scenery is truly breathtaking."
Beomeosa,"Beomosa temple is awesome place . So clean and neat, a beatiful place for people who is looking for peace. Is a temple for meditation so keep your voice lower. Go"
Awesome experience ,It is so very nice day for us the weather is so fantastic and everything around me was so friendly ... Nice people.... How I wish I belong here hehehehe 
Pretty and serene,"This temple complex is beautiful in itself, but the mountain setting makes it simply breathtaking. I took the cable car up to the fortress, ran along the ridge, and then hiked down to Beomeosa, which took about 2 hours. Really rewarding experience!"
"A good place to go on weekday, not weekend","We went to Beomeosa Temple on Sunday of May. The temple was surrounded by trees and natural scenery, which should be a good place to get relaxed. However, the day we visited there was a Sunday and we heard loud pop music from an outdoor concert at the temple. We were very surprised to see the template did allow such noisy concert to be held there which was contradictory to the peaceful image of the temple.Highly suggest to go the temple on weekday to avoid crowds and noise."
Fabulous,This was our first experience of a Korean temple. The beautiful painting and the well maintained gardens and buildings was impressive. The peaceful setting away from the city is great. Well worth a visit. Easy to visit by metro and then bus.
A good place to destress,"Good place within the mountains, air and spring water is fresh. A good place to de-stress. They do offer temple stay as well for those interested and can visit their website to get more information. "
An old refuge from the city.,"For some time during the Joseon dynasty Buddhism was outlawed, as such the faithful had to run into the mountains to practice their faith. And nowadays we get to enjoy some of Korea's heritage in some stunning locations. Bemeosa Temple is a largish temple complex in the northern bit of the city. There is the temple itself, as well as several hiking paths that go up and around the mountain. There is aIso a temple stay program."
"If you can, allot a good chunk of time for this","This temple complex is extensive, it includes not only the buildings but also some amazing nature preserves. In an ideal world, a person would grab their significant other, pack a couple of lunches, a table cloth, water, and something to sit on, and go visit this place with the intention of enjoying everything it has to offer.The temple complex sits on a mountain, the mountain is steep but very fun to hike. There are hiking trails as well as cultural attractions. This is absolutely worth the time."
Serene mountain temple,"Enjoy the walk 3km uphill ( or ride Bus 90) to a beautiful ,serene mountain location temple amidst a forest of greenery and pine trees .Visiting in the few weeks prior to Buddha's birthday in mid May further enhanced the sense with the hanging of hundreds of colourful paper lanterns. Definitely recommend visit while in Busan"
Nice to visit,"Have a short trip out from bustling city and take a deep breath in the nature. There are hiking routes available up there. Taking subway to Beomeosa temple station, walk along street in btw exit 5 & 7. Walk up to the hill 200metre you will see a lot bus stop over. Hop on to the bus No.90 it will bring you to the temple. "
An Absolute Must,"Not far from the city is this humble complex. Still in use, and one of the first to offer temple stays. The grounds are nice, and the setting is beautiful. Hiking around the mountain offers a breath of fresh air and some stunning views. Just be mindful to decide a preferred duration, or have GPS handy, as the trail signs are somewhat misleading and sparse, and the trails don't cycle back. A very enjoyable visit for culture and nature lovers."
Wonderful serenity.,The Beomeosa Temple is well worth the visit out of the city of Busan. Built on the slopes of Mt Geumjeongsan it enjoys an air of mystery. The temple was originally constructed 1300 years ago and is today a National Treasure.
Definate must see during visit to Busan,This beautiful temple and the surrounding natural landscape was a joy to tour through and walk around. The architecture of the temple is impressive and the tour was an enjoyable cultural experience. Definitely worth a visit.
"Explore the surroundings, it's quite nice","While most would stick to just a tour within the compounds of the temple, we found the walk to the stream & boulder ridden forest quite pleasant and enjoyable.The air is fresh & the forest teemed with an array of colors.It's a fully functional temple, so one can see monks chanting, going about their daily lives etc."
Free guided tour,"By chance we were offered a free guided tour in English. This is a precious occasion to understand better the korean culture and traditions, as well as some basics on buddhism."
Must Go!,"Although its not the original one that was but in 6++ BC, renovated again in 1713. (you can google the history) but it is very magnificent and a ""must go"" for me.It is serene and surrounded by nature."
Fun Temple Stay,"This was a unique experience for my fiance and I. We spent a night at the temple stay and the day and evening with monks. They showed us how monks, eat, pray, sleep and basically we lived the life of a monk for a day. It was really interesting and a unique experience. We meditated with the monks which was lovely and they gave us a personal tour of the temple along with our group. They took us for a hike as well. Had a lot of fun, with time for self-reflection as well as meeting interesting people."
Lives up to Reputation,"There are so many temples in Korea that sometimes they all seem the same, but Beomeosa definitely sticks out, and in the best way possible. It also seemed more authentic than some because there was actually worship going on while we were there. The museum was also great, with many old paintings and books and engravings. Definitely worth the trip out to the outskirts of Busan. "
Temple in the hills,"I went here solo, using public transport.( From Haeundae to Beomeosa it took about 45 min one way and cost 1500KW). Take Subway (Metro Line 1) to Beomeosa station then take exit 5. I was surprised not to see other tourists and no tourist info center inside the station (at least near exit 5). There were toilets near exit 5. When you go out of exit 5, look to your immediate right and you'll see a shop called ""Mountia"". If you stand with this shop on your left, looking behind the exit you just came out of, thats the direction you want to go. There is a small street (Cheongnyongyejeon-ro) on the left and you can see a sign for ""Beomeosa"" near the corner and a telephone booth. You must turn left and walk up this little road (Cheongnyongyejeon-ro) about 200 meters (?)-5 min to a big parking lot which is a bus terminal. From here you wait and take bus 90 (1300KW one way and about 15 min to the top) Where the bus lets you off there are some steps and you just follow the steps up to the temple area. I enjoyed wandering around the temples and taking photos for an hour. Other people were hiking around, but I didn't. On the return, I only had to wait about 15 min for bus 90 again at the same place I had been dropped off. Again, cost was 1300kw to go down. If I had had more time, I would suggest you walk down the road that the bus takes, as there were toilets and small snack stalls and little cafes along the roadside. You could then get on the bus a few stops down. The air was fresh and it was nice to hear the birds chirping and be surrounded by nature for a while."
Beautiful Temple by the sea,While this is a recently rebuilt temple the history goes back hundreds of years. I'm told it's one of the very few temples by the sea in Korea. Certainly great views and a sense of peacefulness. I'm glad I saw it and recommend it as one of the wonderful places to visit in Busan. 
Ancient and authentic,"In South Korea, many ancient buildings have undergone reconstruction, reformation and embellishment. I prefer to see old things as they are - rundown and decrepit. In the Beomeosa temple, you can see some statues and buildings like that. It is an interesting mixture of different cultures, geographically and temporally."
Good hiking trails. Stunning in the fall. ,"I hiked here twice and really enjoyed it. I also did a temple stay here and it was a great experience. When I visited in the fall, the view was stunning. There's also this random rock near the top with a bowl-like shape to it. I recommend booking a temple stay and hike up with a monk. His morning stroll up the mountain was like my week's worth of cardio. Great place the to check out."
GREAT hiking behind the temple,"The temple itself was pretty cool to walk 3 km to, but hiking paths behind the temple span SOOOO long it's great! On a whim I hiked to the top of a mountain which took me 4 hours to go up and down in total. Bring a camera or charge your phone to get pics throughout and shoes that you wouldn't mind getting muddy."
The only temple on the water I've seen,"A lot of temples begin to look the same. This one was really pretty on the water. Lots of fun food stalls outside. There were a lot of people by mid-day, and this was during February. It must get crazy-crowded during the summer. Go early in the day. The bathroom was a disaster. Don't use it!"
Peaceful place to refresh your mind,"Once you get off from bus to this temple, you'll immediately feel the calmness and peacefulness of this place. Bird tweeting and the sound of the river makes everything even calmer. I went there solo. So it's a really nice place just to walk around and to see people; monks praying.Behind the temple there's also a hiking track. If I'm not wrong, it took 2 hours fo finish the whole track, so if you want to go hiking, good comfortable shoes are highly recommended because you're going to hike a pretty intense stone road."
Autumn at Beomeosa ,Beautiful place to visit during the autumn foliageSpend some time walking around to explore the temple courtyard and grounds
Historic temple visit,"This is a favorite with locals in The Busan area. My husband is Korean and his family drove us up the mountain here, but you can take the metro to this location if you don't have a car.The building have been kept so well, it is truly beautiful with all the colors. You'll see interesting statues of gods, and places of worship and even a little bamboo forest and a small rocky area where people have set up wishing stones. This is a nice day trip with family."
Beomeosa Temple,"Beomeosa Temple is very nice, you can get to there by metro and from there take a bus or short walk,there is free guide service in the shrine near the information center,nice to walk in the temple complex and the surrounding gardens,the temple design with amazing korean architect with amazing Colors and wood."
Temple,That was great experience. I went to this temple in winter season almost freezing days.... Peaceful place and many Buddha temple inside to pray. It is located in mountain. Fresh air and fresh atmosphere to release stress... 
Great trip for half a day,"The temple is great to reach by metro and then either bus or a short hike uphill, which is definitely worth it. When you reach the top of the temple, you are out of the city and you can enjoy the silence. "
Beomeosa Temple,"Beomeosa Temple worth a visit if you are in Busan. You can reach it easily by metro which has a station of the same name. From the station you take short bus ride to the temple. At the entrance is a tourist information office. I went to the temple on my own without a guide. I was approached by a temple guide who took me around and showed me everything it was free and would not accept any payment for his services, this normal if not unusual. Ask at the office how to spot them. Apart from the fantastic tour (1 hour) the temple monks provide a simple meal for free at lunch time, a bargain! As usual this is a place of worship and should be respected,there are some lovely walks around the temple especially up to the wall gate so take some strong shoes as there are little or no pavements. I went in April and the woods around the stream had cherry blossoms in bloom. If you want to make a temple hike/ visit day of it I suggest you take the cable car at Geumjeong Fortress South Gate (A short walk from the top of the cable car, or a few km from the East Gate, or also the 203 Orange bus from Oncheonjang station). I walked from the temple to the cable car but could not find the cable car because all the signs are in Korean! I had to walk for another hour down through beautiful forest scenery. Get someone to write cable car in Korean for you the walk is straightforward so the hike and temple visit is a good full day out "
Peaceful retreat,"Very calming place, nice get away from the hurry and noise of the city. Hiking trails lead to the pick of the mountain with marvelous view."
Glimpse of monastery life thru templestay,"When planning your itinerary to Busan, slot in a weekend templestay at Beomeosa Temple for an unforgetable experience. You can register online on their website & it is very easy to get there using subway (Beomeosa station) & bus. The templestay gives an interesting glimpse into life in a Korean Seon Buddhist Temple as well as Korean culture. Weekend programs have something for everyone, eg peaceful & relaxing setting, simple but comfortable accommodation (sleeping on traditional heated floors or ondal), meditation techniques, vegetarian meals & tea with the monks, hiking .....The monks & translator (for foreigners) are very welcoming & cheerful, giving short tour of the grounds & explaining things in detail (like how & why to bow, eating meals in silence) as well as answering your questions, should you have any. You are encouraged, but never forced to comply with some of the activities/rituals at the temple (eg if you are uncomfortable about bowing or sitting crossed legged during meditation). Some activities are carried out in the large temple halls & areas where regular tourists are not allowed in, so you get to see more of the temple grounds. You will witness the mesmerizing chants of the monks during the evening ceremony & the amazing beating of the drums at 6pm & 3am. Highly recommended."
"1,300 Year Old Serene Temple for Tranquility and Peace","One of my family trip's highlights was the visit to Beomeosa Temple. This 1,300 year old temple is really beautiful and serene, set against a majestic mountain backdrop. It was near winter during our visit hence it was a tad cold and we didn't get to explore the temple in its entirety but for the grounds that we covered, we were in awe of its calm, silent beauty. A giant gingko tree with yellow leaves greeted us when we arrived. That pretty much set the scene for what to expect next as we wandered into the temple grounds. Amazing architecture, beautiful autumn leaves covering the ground, picturesque misty mountains and the peaceful sense of calm and serenity really made us wonder if this place is really just not to far away from the city of Busan. Notes / Tips1. It was easy to catch a cab from any city points to this temple however it can be difficult to catch one out of it."
Very nice place to visit,"Beomosa Temple is definitely worth visiting. The grounds are really beautiful and the temples are lovely. We didn't have enough time to explore the whole area, you could spend the best part of a day here."
Quiet temple right next to COEX,"We visited Beomeosa Temple since it close to where we were staying. Be aware that this is a temple where people come to worship, it's not just a place for tourists. If you're aiming for uniqueness, go to Haedong Yonggung Temple. If you want to see a temple without a bunch of tourists, visit Beomeosa. "
very quiet place,"it's very quiet and peaceful place, especially go there in the late evening...you can see the sky with the sunset and clouds with so many color!!they also provide a service to stay in the temple for overnight...if you have time, it will be a very good experience!!!"
Beautiful,"This temple was absolutely beautiful, especially in Autumn with the vibrant foliage, ripe persimmons hanging from branches and mist wreathing the valley. However,This temple is an actual place of worship. It is very important to be respectful and quiet. "
Great Historical Place,"A lot to see and if you want to enter, you have to be quiet because its a place of prayers and meditation, pictures could still be taken there though."
Scenic,"We went mid November 2015, the view is spectacular.The vibrant colors of the autumn leaves are awesome! Highly recommended to make a trip there."
Temple(s) and hiking,"Well, it not a hard way to get over to the entrance of the temple. There is bus that stope directly at the entrance of the temple (the lowest one), however you can explore more temples if you decided to walk along the trails (mainly big rocks) against the gravity up hill. after all the temples, you can choose also to hike further up to the hill peak(800++m high) where you can enjoy fantastic 360 degree views there.Probably due to the rocky terrace, i see not much tourist during my visit there especially those that on higher ground. But there is local korean that hike the mountain.Getting drinking water is not easy during the hiking.. thus prepare some drinking water is the best unless you are willing to consume spring water flowing non stop just before the last Mi Le temple / peak.There is no food available for purchase upon entrance to the temple, however there is a few local stalls located nearby (slightly further) from the bus station you alight at the entrance."
Nice Temple,This temple has a big compound with many buildings to explore. It is full of tourists when we got there. Nice refreshing mountain spring water is available free of charge. Scopes are provided also.You can take the metro to Beomeosa station. Take exit 5 or 7. Walk up the road between the two exits for about 10 min and you should reach the bus stop. Take bus 90 to the temple.
A Must Do,We were here at the height of the autumn season. The colours were super. Even the locals were taking photos of the trees!!
"Beautiful Temple, lots of walking.","This temple is HUGE! There are various things to see here. There's a bus you can take, but then you have to walk, UP!!! I was wicked tired after visiting this temple, but it was worth it. We went on a weekday and it was not crowded at all. There was a very nice volunteer there that told us about the history and where to go. The best part was the various statues. =) There is also a hike up to see the entire city, but I couldn't make it up there! There's also a place to see a waterfall, but it was walking up on rocks. So if you aren't a hiking person, you might want to think about it. Overall it's a nice place."
Wonderful temple in the mountains,"Nice serene temple in the mountains, nice view of autumn colors of nearby hills. Only downside is that Beomeosa is too popular. The crowd during a weekday is not considered high, yet it still distrupts the serenity. Can imagine the weekend crowd, Directions: L1 Beomeosa Station, Exit 5 or 7. Will see sign “梵鱼寺, 3km” (in Korean, Chinese & English) at road junction between these 2 exits, walk into the road (up slope), will see small bus terminal after 5-8min. Take Bus No. 90 here (20min)."
Nice temple,"You can do a full 6 hours hike or a bus ride to the temple.I highly suggest a bus ride, because it's gorgeous and you can see the whole Busan from it. The temple itself is ok, nice afternoon visit ;)"
Amazing place,climbing to mountain from stone steps and walking around the temples are really wonderful. the buddhists are praying and you can join them if you want.Everyone should visit this temple when they come to Busan!
Another beautiful Korean temple to visit,A late afternoon visit in October sunshine shows the temple in a beautiful light. We were fortunate enough to meet a guide who was full of interesting historical and religious information. Well worth a visit.
Probably the best temple n Busan,"If you are a big Korean drama fan, then this scene must be so familiar for you. All the ancient woodcraft, the monks and the building, now you get a chance to have a closer look while enjoy the scenery too."
Serenity,"One of the most peaceful place I have been to Situated high up the mountains, the view is magnificent, especially during autumn. Take a train to Beomeosa Temple station, the walk up hill to a bus station. Take bus 90 to Beomeosa Temple. The view is pretty great with the autumn leaves. The area is quiet and serine. However, the structure itself is not that great. A pretty nice and comfortable place though. Suggest to visit this place if you have extra time from your Busan trip."
weekend templestay experience- a unique experience,"We booked here for the templestay - check in at 1.00pm on sat and leaving 11am on sunday, costing 70,000W incl accomdation/vegetarian food. We had an option to either go for the trek up the mountain on the sunday or just have a chat /tea with the monk. We opted for the trek.The gave you a cotton uniform to wear for the duration of your stay- I brought some extra food (ie bread/snacks) in case there wasnt enough food but that wasnt necessary. Bottled water was in plentiful supply and there were public wells around the temple grounds where you can help yourself to as much fresh water as you want. Also there was a vending machined outside the canteen where the coffee/tea were free so you could get your caffeine fix anytime. The food were good (beansprouts/tofu, mushroom) in both dinner and breakfast - the latter were one of the best i ever had. The dinner was quite formal as you had to wait for everybody and you were sat on the floor (which i found quite uncomfortable) but the breakfast was a lighter affair - chance for seconds and sitting on chairs. What i found challenging:sitting cross legged for 30/45 mins in one length of timethe 108 prostrations (that is bowing) - one for each bead that you thread for your necklacesleeping on ondal floor (underfloor heating) as it was my first time - too hot and not able to adjust the temperature.What i enjoyed:the whole stay as it was something different - staying in a temple overnight (beautifu and peaceful surroundings)the drumming which happened at 6.30 the second night - it was awesome. The rhythm, sound and skill practiced by the monk was the highlight.the monks chanting - I didnt understand but it was like music/melodic. I shut my eyes and it was very soothing.the food (I did not miss meat) - it was satisfying and there were chillis/dips if you wanted a stronger taste.We stayed and had the free lunch the next day - it was good. Tips:Bring earplugs/eye mask. we shared the room with 8 girls and they stayed up till 11pm to chat (we were suppose to switch off at 9pm).The ondal was so hot - i put an extra duvet btw me and the floor as it was burning through my back and there was no cool spot anywhere else on the floor. There was option to have showers but it was a bit far from the bedrooms so no point bringing in bathtowel as no one had a shower. torch /lighting - may be useful if you were planning ot walk round temples at night as a lot of the areas were dark and no lighting. I would reccommend this for the experience and something different - I was planning to book a stay in a hanok to sleep on ondal but this covered it. Also the cost goes towards the temples renovation so its a worthwhile cause. I am not a buddhist and dont plan on becoming one but this is a good place away from the crowd and to recharge"
vegan meals here .,"for vegan or vegetarian , you can have your meal here . lunch and dinner, check the meal time when u arrive at temple. "
worth the effort......,"Getting there is all part of the experience.....prime property location.....in. beautiful nature setting up in the hills....temple and shrines are an expedience in itself.....stunning .......not to be missed, even if you have seen it all.....!"
Beautiful leaf,"Nice scenery,nice trees,quiet place to relax,good jungle tracking place, cold weather nice to walk,easy to reach."
One of two temples you should visit in Busan.,"(the other is Haedung Youngungsa, the one by the ocean) Beomeo Temple takes a little bit of traveling to get to (I just grabbed a cab, but expect traffic) but it's well worth it. Plan to spend a few hours there as the grounds are extensive, and also expect to take lots of pictures. It's a really beautiful mountain temple, typical of many in South Korea."
Temple visit,A long walk to this place downstairs and a real test to our legs that we are able to walk up for the buses Going using the MRT and change to Buses with no hassle at all
