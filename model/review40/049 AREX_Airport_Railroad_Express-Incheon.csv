Fastest and Super Comfy Ride to and From Airport,We availed this service during our visit to South Korea. We took the KTX from Pohang to Seoul and took the AREX Express Service to reach Incheon Airport. The ticketing is easy and reasonable. It takes 46 mins to reach the airport. The ride is comfortable with very spacious Toilet and complimentary water bottle. Theres an electric cart service at airport from 7am to 7pm- complimentary to passengers of AREX Express passengers. Don't forget to return the ticket card at destination and take your 500Won!
Really easy to get to Seoul from Incheon,"We decided to stay in Seoul for two nights on our way home. Rather than carry heavy bags around the city we booked a hotel in Onseo which is close to the airport. We bought T-money cards at the airport which meant we could initially use the AREX all stop train to get to our hotel (10 minute journey). The next 2 days we used then AREX alll stop train to get in and out of Seoul from Onseo (40 minutes each way) and do all of our sightseeing. The T-money card could also be used on the subway so it meant getting around the city was easy, it is also very cheap. AREX was clean and quick with plenty of space for suitcases so it was perfect for us."
Superb Convenient Transportation,Arex save us alot of time while we were very tiring and lost direction.The journey from Seoul Airport to Seoul is about 30-45mins and very comfortable train.It is better to buy online first and redeem your ticket at machine. Easy redeemption with no extra cost. As around if you are unable to find the machine.
AREX from ICN to Seoul Station,"First, please know there are TWO types of Airport Trains. One is LOCAL and stops at all the stations between Incheon (the city) and Seoul. The other is almost non-stop to Seoul Station (stops once? before Seoul Station..IDK, I'm usually napping). I'm reading various reviews from people who are obviously getting on the wrong train type and complaining how slow it is (SMH, geez) or how it doesn't stop locally. I don't think people realize the airport is 50 KM away from the city center. And Seoul, like any big city, has traffic. All. The. Time. So yeah, less than 60 minutes to the city center is ""fast."" The signs to either train are clearly marked ""express or local"" (with arrows). From your terminal, follow the signs to the AREX station. Once there, you can stand in line for the ticket counter or just buy your ticket via the machine (press ENGLISH if you want instructions in English people!) Pay 9K KW via credit card/bank card or cash. You get a reserved car AND seat # which is clearly printed on your receipt. You get a credit card looking ticket with a 500 won deposit charge. Once the gate is open (yes, there is a designated boarding time which is CLEARLY displayed by the entrance), swipe your card, find your seat, sit down. There are busses, cars, taxis, but this is probably the cheapest and fastest way for 1 to 2 people. If you are a large group, then maybe 9K KW per person is too much collectively. There is a luggage area in each train car. Once you arrive in Seoul Station, swipe your card to get out, and then go directly to the machine about 10 feet away from the exit to return the AREX card and get your 500 KW deposit back. From Seoul Station, you can easily switch to the Seoul Metro system. The last time I took it (November 2019), I walked to the AREX station at Terminal 2 at 4:55 AM, bought my ticket at the machine in 30 seconds for the 5:15 AM Express train and boarded at 5:05 AM. Was there a chance I might have ""just missed it"" and had to wait for the next train? Sure, but that's life, and I have no control over how long passport control might have taken."
So easy and fast!!,"We (a group of 6) booked our tickets through klook.com because they were much cheaper than buying them directly from the counter. Klook will then send us a voucher through email, and with the printed (or mobile friendly) voucher, we exchanged them for tickets from the ticket counter at the train station in the airport building. Very easy and convenient. YOu have to pay KW500 in cash for each ticket (as security for the return of the ticket, which is in a credit card format). Upon arrival at your final destination (for us, it was the Seoul Main Station), we slotted our card-tickets into a ""Return"" machine and got back our KW500 deposit each.The train that we took was a non-stop one because it is faster. They also have one with multiple-stops, so, make sure you buy the correct ticket. Overall, it is a convenient and fast way to get to central Seoul. Not the cheapest - if you want that, go for the bus, but be prepared to be stuck in a traffic jam!Overall, we have a positive experience with AREX. There was sufficient place for us to store our big luggage and hand luggage. Highly recommended!!"
Fast & Easy,"We had a 20-hour layover at ICN airport and decided to make the most of it by taking the AREX train into Seoul to explore the city.The train was fast (~45 min) and easy to navigate from the airport (take the express train if you're going to Seoul Station, the commuter train takes ~60 min). The experience was super easy thanks to the friendly staff at the ticket booths and free WiFi on board. There are airport buses that take you to Seoul but I prefer AREX because it is the fastest / most reliable option since traffic can be unpredictable."
Fare adjustment option is helpful,"I bought ticket to Seoul Station. Then I realised I could get onto the airport railway without exiting Seoul Station. There was no staff and no extra ticket machine on the way. When I arrived at Unseo station, there is a fare adjustment machine. It told me how much fare adjustment upward is needed. I added the value to my one way ticket and I exited successfully. I think this measure is helpful for travellers in a hurry"
"Convenient way to get to Incheon Airport, your hotel nearby, Seoul Station and plenty of good things in-between !","I just arrived in Incheon last Wednesday and so far I have caught the AREX from Unseo station to Seoul Station/Hongik University station and vice versa. The train is quick and efficient. There is lots of room for people and their suitcases, and the announcements on the train are made in Japanese, Chinese, Korean and English. There are two services - one which stops at all AREX stations from ICN to Seoul and one that goes express. Each takes between 40 - 50 mins respectively. The AREX is a great service and I recommend it."
Clean & Comfortable ,We took the express train from Seoul Station to Incheon and with reserved seats. It is much more comfortable than possibly having to stand up with other options. 
Helpful lost and found!,"I got in a train to Busan, realizing that I didn't have my backpack with me. I tried to remember where I lost it but I couldn't really.. I thought it was in the waiting area or on the platform. So after reaching out to the train staff they contacted different people. After 15 minutes I got a response that my backpack was in an AREX train, the one I got from the airport! So they found it safely and I can come get it. I was so relieved, everyone was super helpful and nice! Thank you again ✨"
great way into Seoul,"very good, fast, good value, clean, well laid out, reserved seats and good baggage storage takes you right from the centre of the airport into the main Seoul railway station. Ticketing can be via a desk or machine (very easy to use) and the trains make the journey into Seoul very simple. Much much better than taking on the traffic congestion in a taxi and way cheaper."
Very well done ,Nice and fastest option to get to and from Seoul main train terminal. Clean and comfortable. Well priced. 
AREX - Fast and Easy,"Arex train was super fast and easy !! There’s two types of arex which is express subway from incheon airport to seoul station or all stop train which stop at certain station all the way to seoul station !! I took express subway from seoul station to incheon which takes 40 minutes and i got free tickets due to my discover seoul pass. Price of the ticket should be less than 10000 won and can be paid using T money card.I recommend arex train which is the fastest train, it’s comfortable and also there’s enough space for your luggage!"
Amazing Serviceq,"If I could rip this train out and carry it on my back anywhere I went. It is cheap ($8 USD), it is fast, it is clean, and it is super convenient. For those of us who are Korean challenged, there are plenty of English signs anywhere. Its extremely easy to navigate and super safe. If you have seven hours or more at ICN for a layover, you have more than enough time to catch the train and spend a few hours in Seoul discovering stuff."
Fastest way to the city,Would recommend the direct express service rather than the stopping train for the price difference. Takes 43 minutes to Seoul station. Free internet on the train with free water bottles. Seats are assigned when you purchase a ticket. Comfortable seat and smooth ride. Definitely recommend. 
Convenient but not Express,Journey takes around 1 hour from Seoul station. Lots of stops not a dedicated airport service. Slight quicker than the coach. Does represent good value. 
Great way to get to airport,"I’ve always been happy with KAL Limo Bus between Incheon Airport and Plaza Hotel downtown in Seoul. But loved the AREX train this morning. Smoother, faster, and cheaper than the bus. Will be my go-to method in the future."
Best way to travel ,"The AREX is best way to travel between Incheon Airport and Seoul. (9000W) Another cheaper alternative is just take the regular metro. (5000W). Though more stops, journal is equally present. There is a refundable deposit for the card. Purchase of these tickets are easily done through the machine. "
Absolutely the best way to get from the airport to Seoul centre,"Easy route to follow in the airport - just follow the signs for Airport Express. Ticket machines have easy to follow instructions in english. Takes 45 minutes for the journey.The 'all stop' train is cheaper, but takes about 20 minutes more.For both trains remember to put your plastic ticket card into the refund machine when you have gone through the barriers at your exit station to get your 500 won refund."
"simple, easy, no fuss, convenient","Excellent, non stop service to the airport, frequent and very inexpensive.Delivers you straight into the terminalsI wouldn't consider any other way of getting to this airport "
Convenient,Pretty convenient and time saving from Incheon airport straight away to Seoul Station. Suggested to purchase the ticket online via kkday/klook to get cheaper price.
Best way to travel from the airport to the city center,"A very efficient and affordable way to travel from Incheon Airport to the city center, especially with the express train. I visited Seoul twice this summer and preferred the AREX express train to reach Seoul Station and from there go to my hotel by using one of the metro lines. Information on how to use the train are in English while for further info, one can get help from the station attendants. It is especially convenient on the trip back from Seoul to the airport as you can check in at Seoul Station if you travel on certain airlines such as Asiana and Korean Airlines. It beats getting stuck in traffic and is very reliable."
Best option to Seoul !!!,AREX is your best option to travel from Incheon Airport to Seoul. You need to head to the basement level to get to the train station. You can use the Kiosks or buy your ticket from the ticket counter. The ticket to Seoul is about 9500 WON . You can get a discount on your tickets if you traveled by Korean Airlines or have a receipt from any of the currency exchanges.The first express train leaves from Incheon at 5.15 am and reaches Seoul station around 6.00 am. The train offers free wifi on board. Seats are assigned .You can use the ticket return machine at your destination station to return your ticket card and get back your 500 won deposit.
Quick and comfortable,"Took this on a business trip from the central station to the airport. It was much more comfortable than going by taxi as I did when I arrived, and neither quicker nor slower. The AREX station is a bit difficult to find in the Central Station, so do make sure you ask at information desk and arrive in time. It also is a decent walk and several flights of very steep electronic stairs (or lifts) down. If you have a lot of luggage or struggle to carry your luggage or have problems walking, I wouldn't recommend it. The staff at the counter speak good English. However no one tells you that if you take a one-way ticket you pay a deposit of 500 Won for the ticket. Once you arrive, there is a machine just as you exit where you can insert your ticket and get you deposit back. I read this somewhere online, and it was straight forward and easy. Again, you walk a decent distance till you get to the actual check-in hall, but all airports are the same in that regard."
All Stop Train is convenient and reasonably priced,"I stayed a couple of days at an Incheon Airport hotel and just took the train into Seoul. I looked into taking the express train, but in the end, the All Stop train had more departures. Even though the All Stop train makes more stops, the ride was only about 15 min longer, but more convenient times. The trains are clean, modern and run frequently to Seoul Station. There is ample signage, including the stops listed in English and an English announcements. There are machines outside of each boarding area, so it is easy to purchase a one-time pass. All the machines have a button to switch to English. Since I was riding the train and later subways in Seoul more frequently, I found a machine that provided a reloadable card. With both the one-time pass cards and the reloadable card, one has to scan the cards to get to the platform, and re-scan when leaving the platform area. Immediately after the exit scan there are machines that you can insert your one-time card to get the 500 won deposit back. The reloadable card has a 3000 won deposit, but for me it was worth it not to have to deal with always having to purchase a one-time pass for each train/subway and then get my deposit back.Travel time between Incheon Airport Terminal 1 and the Seoul Station is about an hour on the All Stop train. Oh one caution, when leaving the Seoul Station, sometimes there is an All Stop Train that heads in the direction of the Incheon Airport, but diverts to a different ending station (I think after the Gimpo Airport stop). I mistakenly got on this train once, but just jumped off at Gimpo stop and waited few minutes for the next All Stop Train, which then went to the Incheon Airport Terminal 1 stop (it also goes to terminal 2, which is the final stop)."
"At 59 minutes, the all stations cheap train is great value","Since I travelled on AREX in 2012, a couple of new suburban stations may have been added to the stops for the cheaper all stations train as the Seoul to Incheon T1 trip took 59 minutes.It remains excellent, fast and comfortable.The trek from Seoul station concourse to the platforms is lengthy and involves a few stairs where there are automated luggage conveyors, travelators, escalators and some working. It is well signposted.I used a T Money card. Be aware only cash is accepted for top ups. It can also be used in Busan.Trains are reliable and way preferable to a taxi or airport bus. Some of the freeways can be congested but the train has no such problems."
Easy and Fast transport,Absolutely quick and easy and comfortable.Not much of a walking distance from the main airport. Some small cafes for a quick bite at the station. Lift as well as an escalator available to the station.
Very comfortable and cheap way to get from Seoul and Incheon airport vice versa,V good. Seamless. But need to have clearer instructions on weaving through the complicated Seoul station.
Frequency insufficient,"Express train took 51 minutes to Seoul. Local trains took 66 minutes. Express train is MORE than 15 minutes intervals and if you arrived just missing a departure, safe the money and go for local trains which ran at much more frequent intervals.On departure, ensure you check your terminal for disembark and keep at least 15-20 minutes for walking to your check-in counter.Luggage rack is in sufficient and therefore needed to be well organised."
"Goes Often, Goes Fast","Just be careful of the Seoul train station luggage lockers (on the east side of the building). The procedure is incomprehensible (in Korean) -- I think you have to set up an account (with a fingerprint) BEFORE you put you bag in the locker. The door locks when a bag is placed in it. If you've not pre-registered -- uh oh.Anyway, the express is a good way to get to the airport (my other option was SRT to Suseo, then a long 6300 bus ride or subway into Seoul)."
The all-stop train has its advantages,"Many of the reviews have been focused on the AREX but the all-stop train has some advantages. Firstly it is 40% cheaper, KRW 4750 from Terminal 2 or KRW 4150 from Terminal 1. It is more frequent, meaning it could be faster catching the all-stop train rather than waiting for the AREX. Most importantly it takes Tmoney card instead of having to buy a separate ticket for AREX. If you are travelling further after getting to Seoul station, either on bus or subway, you might get a transfer discount."
Fast and Efficient Travel from Incheon to Seoul Station,"There were two types of trains to Seoul Station from Incheon Airport. Instead of the all stop one (for around W4000), I selected the express train (around W9000) that zipped us to Seoul a little quicker (saved about 15 minutes from Terminal 1). However if you are on a budget or you don’t have tired kids who want to get to the hotel ASAP then I recommend getting the all day pass which also includes the all stop train fare plus unlimited subway and bus use in Seoul. The train was full but we easily found our reserved seat. Some people were asking about available seats so not certain if they remembered to wait around after they bought their tickets to get the receipt with their seat number. If you forget, like I originally did, you can go to the ticket booth and ask them to scan a ticket and they will reprint your seat details.Luggage was left at the beginning of the car in the limited storage rack area that was capable of holding around 6-9 pieces of luggage depending on their size. If you have small, lightweight bags then you can place it on the small shelf above your seat.Seats were comfortable (including a decent recline). About half the seats faced front while the other half faced back. The train left on time so no dawdling.After arrival, don’t forget to return the plastic cards in order to get back your W500 deposit on each card.Overall this was a comfortable and easy ride to Seoul Station."
Fast and Easy Way from Central Seoul to Incheon Airport,"I decided that I would catch the AREX from Seoul as I had spent my last day in town, with my luggage.I found it super easy to purchase a ticket from the machine, and also found that as I was there early enough, I could check my bags for my Asiana Airlines flight right there at the station.Train was comfortable, and convenient for the trip!Would definitely use again"
"Great, speedy and crowded ",Shuttle is a great service but in certain areas/stations it tends to get crowded. Standing for 45 minutes is not great but it is faster than taking a bus. 
Train was good but customer service was bad.,"Bought the Arex tickets online and as ours was a morning flight, we almost missed our train and flight due to the absence of personnel managing the station. Not able to speak korean , we were lost. Luckily the janitor there ,( with the help of sign language), helped us by pressing the help button . we made it in a nick of time to board the AREX. Tks to the janitor ."
super convenient airport train connecting ICN airport and Seoul with stop at Kimpo airport,"I used this train several times in Korea and it is fast, convenient and cost-effective. There are even rack space to put your luggage."
Hassle free airport trip,On arrival you might take the teain to main station and there are plenty of taxis to continue. On departure there is lounge!
"By Far, The Fastest Way to Get into Seoul","The AREX airport train is an efficient and cost-effective means to travel from Incheon to Seoul (and back). There are two trains: an express and a local, but the overall travel time is not significantly different. The main difference is that you won't get as many local commuters on the express train.From Incheon to downtown Seoul, the fare is roughly $4.25 each way; but check the map to buy the ticket for the station at which you want to exit. For example, the fare from Seoul to Incheon varies as to whether you're getting off in Terminal 1 or Terminal 2."
"Tried both the All-stops, as well as the Express. Both are convinient and cheap.","ICN to Seoul, arrived early morning, and the Express was running at hourly intervals. Decided to take the all-stops. Not very crowded, and there is space for luggage. Seoul Station is a pain to get out off, there are multiple lifts and escalators to get up to ground level.Seoul to ICN took the Express. The service was excellent, with wifi and a hostess who passed around bottles of water. Signage at ICN sirport is confusing, it assumes which checkin row you need is known to you.Tip: tickets on the Express are available at discounts in travel apps all over, as well as with your Boarding cards, etc. Check around, although at under US$9, the list price is cheap."
A Great Way To Get to the Airport ,Taking the airport express is a really quick and stress free way to get to the airport. I highly recommend taking it if you are coming in from Seoul Station.
Efficient and Affordable,This is one of the best and most efficient service I have ever had in an airport to the city. The punctuality and the cleanliness are incredibly impressive. The fare is very affordable from ICN to Seoul Station and it only takes less than an hour. The bonus part is the complimentary wifi on board that offers high speed internet. I have been using AREX every time I go to South Korean and I would definitely recommend this service.
Excellent Train Service between Aiports,"My journey into Seoul took the AREX train between Incheon and Gimpo International Airports.Very efficient service, clean carriages and with timely run trains."
Convinient transfer right into Seoul station,"Took about 50 minutes into Seoul Station. Not a lot of space to put your suitcases on the train, it's setup much more like a metro train rather than a longer distance one, but it does the job."
Arex Express from seoul to Incehon,"The train is incredibly punctual. Rpde the train on 2 Apr 19, from Seoul to Incheon airport. Train is clean and well orgnised, so you also need to be well organised as the train will stop briefly at stops, a minute or so.In my haste to retireve my luggage to the platform I forgot my backpack. Horrors of horrors for me. I approach the ticket office at 1.45pm to report my loss to a Mr Kim Ji Sung who just took note of our train ticket and without fuss said you return at 2.10pm. And at exactly 2.10pm he retireved the bag to me like is a most normal thing.I am impressed with efficiency, honesty, courtesy, and all that makes the train ride the best experience.The retrieval of the lost luggage experience is most outstanding. No paperwork, no 'interrogation' just pure efficiency and customer positive experience.Ps. wanted to write to the company but couldn't find the email contact. They should be proud of the outstanding customer service."
Smooth Transfer to Down Town,"We took AREX from the Airport to the city. Overall, it is good experience & cost effective option than calling a cab or taking bus for longer duration. We traveled for 4 adults and 1 kid without any challenges and using this service which was actually bundled with the tourist travel pass. Anyway, will use this service again in my next visit to Seoul."
Incheon Airport to Seoul Station,Great mode of transportation between Incheon International airport and Seoul Station. Reasonably priced ticket per passenger and about 45-minute ride with some scenic views along the way when running on surface.
AREX (Express Train) Terminal 2- 1st Time in South Korea,"We have booked the express train at klook expecting that our flight schedule will fit in the schedule of the train. However, we forgot that South Korea is 1hour ahead of PH time. So, we were running towards the station after we passed through immigration. It says there that the last trip for AREX is 22:40 and 23:32 and we have arrived almost 10:00 pm Seoul time and it took us a long time to pass immigration since there are a lot of people linig up. It took us about 30-40 mins.   Advice for those who are travelling at 3pm on wards from the Philippines.. make sure to check your schedule before booking because Seoul time is 1hour ahead and you maybe late for your train. And the airport is so huge that it will take time going to one point from another. Fortunately there are trains within the airport.  Anyway, so we have paid 16.43 usd (3people) at klook and made a 500krw each deposit at the counter for the card.  The ride was so hassle free and after a long travel from my country, the express train is a much welcome rest stop for about 45mins.  The Train has super fast wifi as expected from South Korea. :)  I strongly recommend express train cause it won't stop at every station. It just go directly at Seoul Station.  Hope this post is helpful :)"
Value for money,Paid a little bit more for this seamless and non crowded way to travel from Incheon international airport to Seoul main station. It's spacious and there is a huge toilet on board. Free wifi
Incredibly efficient,"Not knowing the Korean language, and feeling a bit nervous, I can tell you that I need not have been. So efficient...including printing boarding pass, checking baggage, and going through immigration before getting on the train. 8000 wan. Wifi. Fast."
"Nice, clean and on time",AREX gives a smart connection from Seoul Station to T1 and T2Price is 9500 won but then you get deposit (500) backFree wifi is helping to stay connected to the business or enjoy internet for fun
Incheon to Seoul Station,1st : Buy the Arex ticket at KKday online = 5200 won ( the cheapest way to Seoul ). 2nd : Go to Arex automatic machine or Incheon Arex Counter to change the voucher into original ticket.3rd : Just input the voucher no in the automatic machine then we choose the dept time at the machine. Paid additional charge= 500 won for the card4th : Get in the train ( 55min travel time to Seoul Station )5th : Get off the train and find the automatic refund machine. Put the arex card in the machine then you will get the refund 500 won for each card. 6th : Take taxi from Seoul Station to Myeongdong area for about 15min = 3700 or 4000 won.
The second easiest way to get to Incheon from Seoul,"Easy, convenient, reliable, reasonably priced, spacious, comfortable, quiet, efficient, quick and fun. What's not to like?"
Fastest way to get to Seoul Station,Had a long layover in Seoul so we decided to take the express train into the city. It was really fast and frequent enough. It takes 45 minutes approximately from terminal 1
Tricky for those exiting at Hongik University Station's Line 2 Exits from Incheon Airport,"As my title states, if you are travelling down to Hongik University Station from Incheon Airport via the AREX (and have only purchased a single-trip ticket instead of loading up your T-Money card), do note that the exits at the Line 2 area of the Hongik University Station will NOT permit you to leave the gantry.We purchased single-trip tickets from Incheon Airport Station to Hongik University Station. It is a 55-minute ride to Hongik University Station. Our hotel is located near the Line 2 exits. We had 4 huge luggages. It was quite a walk from the airport to the Incheon Airport Station, and yet another long walk from the AREX station to the Line 2 station of Hongik University Station. We realised our tickets were unable to grant us exit at Line 2, because we had already tapped out at the Gyeongui–Jungang Line. If you do not tap out at the Gyeongui–Jungang Line, you will NOT be able to reach Line 2 and you will not reach the exits.You will have to press the Emergency button to get the train staff to buzz you out via the handicapped gantries (just push the metal gate). Look for the machines near the gantries. You will see a large blue wheelchair on the gate. The train staffs speak simple English, albeit a little rude. His instructions were not clear so here's us telling you what to do here (in case you are stuck like us at the station, and looked up Google for answers.)It was a very strange problem that Korail has yet to fix for the single-trip users of the AREX. We experienced this two years ago, and it's still the same in 2019.My advice is to take the airport shuttle instead. It may cost twice the price, but definitely ten times less troublesome."
Best way to get from Incheon to Seoul!,Cheap and efficient. Train shows up relatively frequently. Best way to get into Seoul. Just have to go downstairs and reasonably easy to navigate with suitcases. 
Convenient and the best available transport to airport,It is a worry free transport to airport because of the precise timing of departure as per scheduled. Very convenient and passenger no need to stand in the coach because every ticket purchased will mention the coach that you will ride and your seat number. 
Be aware ot ticketing,"Used the stopping train to transfer from Incheon Airport to Gimpo Airport, tickets are only sold at vending machines and those machines only accept cash so I needed to change some money in order to buy a ticket. Otherwise the service was a typical metro style train and was cleaning and on time."
ICN to Seoul City,"Took non-stop express at KRW9000, KRW7000 for kidWas given discount of KRW1500 as we travel via Korean Air. Prices above are before discount.It is clean, and of course by it's name, fast.Seat number is assigned.Overall, good experience and no problem finding it in ICN airport."
Fantastic,"If you are traveling to Seoul Station, you get to choose Non Stop service (faster, seats assigned) or All Stop Service (cheaper, slower, grab whatever seats like a normal subway train).Both options are great ! Tip: find out what are the next train slots for both. If the next Express train is 30min later, you might even get there faster with all-stop train."
one of the best airports in the world,"one of the best airports in the world I have ever visited. Great facilities, everything you need in airport"
Quick and Easy,"I don't want to stay long at airports and rather have a busy time travelling around the tourist areas of a city than stay long at an airport. Rather adventuorus because you can mis the flight if you really max out the time. But with AREX, you are sure that your time is well estimated and that the journey will be easy and smooth. Makes more time productive for tourists!"
Great Railroad system,Staffs are helpful. The English signs are clear. Ticket vending machine is user friendly for people do not know Korea
Easy way to get between the airports & Seoul station,"We got the AREX express from Incheon to Seoul station, which was fantastic. Comfortable seats, plenty of room for luggage, fast. We got the AREX all stops train from Seoul Station to Gimpo and liked it less. There were no seats or luggage racks. I'm not sure if all the cars are like that or if it's just the one we were in? It was still fast, convenient and got the job done."
AREX all-stop train convenient for Incheon to Seoul journey,"Incheon Airport to Seoul Station via AREX all-stop train is the best value as compared to the Express train. from Terminal 1 (most international flights) to Seoul Station--(1) 4,150KRW for all-stop vs 9,000 KRW for Express, adult fare(2) 59 mins for all stop vs 43 mins for Express(3) there are 11 stops between Terminal 1 and Seoul Station(4) there are more all-stop trains so sometimes it is a push to wait for Express vs jumping on an all-stop train for less money here are some hopefully helpful hints regarding taking the AREX all-stop train:(1) after exchanging your money into KRW, a minimum of 10,000KRW is recommended to take the all-stop train, more if you take Express, go to a Travel Center instead of a convenience store to buy the IC card ( ""T-money"" equivalent if you only intend to take the AREX train and metro/subway; we only used the IC card for transportation so can't say whether it is functionally equivalent to T-money). the cost of the ""generic IC"" card is 4,000KRW regardless of purchase location and you don't have to wait in a long line in a convenience store at the airport.(2) go the AREX train entrance at the lower level (look for AREX signs) and use the ticket machines. the AREX info window does not sell tickets, you must deal with the machines. instead of buying a one-way ticket which also costs 100KRW more, use the general machine which allows you to load/charge the IC card. you can select English, Korean, Chinese languages at the machine. put 10,000KRW onto the card and you are good to go. there are no signs telling you the costs of the train at the general machine, but you can get an AREX Passenger's Guide at the AREX info window at the entrance. this printed guide tells you the fees for all-stop and Express.(3) use the ""charged/loaded"" IC card to pass thru the turnstile with your luggage and also at exiting. the fare will be automatically deducted at exit. Terminal 1 to Seoul Station (last stop) is 4,150KRW, Terminal 2 to Seoul Station is 4,750KRW.(4) the IC card now can also be used for all subway rides and you can add/charge to the card when necessary. the AREX Passenger's Guide has train schedules and a handy Metro Subway Line Map.(5) the exit at Seoul Station is #15, this numbered exit is not on the Google Map when we were there in Oct 2018. the taxis are outside on the street at exit #15. use #15 also on return to Incheon since this exit is closest to AREX trains' entrance.N.B.--Courtyard (Marriott) Namdaemun stopped the free shuttle service for Seoul Station effective Oct 1, 2018.(6) make sure you reload the card to at least the train fare amount when you leave Seoul. we did not try to get any money back on the card for the small balance since you have to find a convenience store to do the refund. the refund machines do not take this card.the passenger load on the train varies depending on the time of the day. there is no luggage storage section on the all-stop train. it's just like a subway/metro car and you keep your suitcases in front of you. there are also no overhead racks/shelves to store anything. the cars are clean and ride smooth. we recommend saving money with the all-stop train vs taking the Express train."
Very convenient,"Easy and quick transfer from Incheon airport to Seoul station in the heart of Seoul. Express train (I selected this option) takes around 45 minutes. Well sign-posted, easy to find, to my mind very cheap (I paid 7500 Won one-way being equal to approx. US-$ 6,50). Very clean, well maintained, free WiFi on the train.On my return I could check in my luggage at the city airport terminal at Seoul station (this service is available for a few airlines only, e.g. Korean and Asiana). Great experience."
Cheap and Convenient,it is a easy way to get to the airport.Cheap&Convenient +on time. Better than limousine bus (traffic)
Nice Airport Express train,The AREX is a very nice airport express trains between Icheon International Airport and Seoul Station. Tickets were reasonably prices and on the platform were plenty of seating for the wait. The train was comfortable and the journey not long and pleasant with nice views into the city. This really is the best way to head into the city in my opinion. At Seoul Station there was a free shuttle bus for the Courtyard Marriott Hotel making the whole trip from airport to hotel extremely pleasant.
"cheap, fast and best","Go from airport to anywhere, safe, reliable, convenient and resonably priced. Use this when visiting Incheon airport to get to city."
Direct or All Stop Train,"There is 2 option to go to Seoul Station from Incheon Airport. Express Train or All Stop Train. Express Train fares for Adults are 9,000 won / Children 7,000 won & All Stop Train fare for Adults cost 4,150 won. Express Train takes 43 minutes journey meanwhile All Stop Train takes 53 minutes & stop at 10 major station."
Incheon to Gimpo,2nd time taking airex all stop train. The train is very quiet and smooth. Good service by the staff who drive the buggy as we were with kids and luggages. 
Efficient & clean,"Traveling to Incheon the bus is better, but rail is efficient for Seoul You need cash to get a ticket so stop at the ATM"
Very nice transit,I took the line from Incheon Terminal 1 to Unseo where I was staying. Just two short stops. Very clean and modern. Not over crowded at least at the times I traveled. Very reasonably priced plus you can return the card after transit for a 500 Won rebate. 
Excellent way to travel to and from the airport,Be aware that this is not only for people travelling to and from the airport. This can also be used like any other lines of the subway.
Fast and comfortable train ,"Train is comfortable and has free WiFi in board. You will be allocated a seat for the journey, unlike the all stop train where you may have to stand all the way. Do ensure to check for the train timing and also, it may get a bit complicated trying to figure out how to get the tickets from Seoul Station (the station is huge and thus have to walk up and down. A bit troublesome with luggage)."
Easy transit to Incheon airport to Seoul,"The train is nice and clean. Seats are assigned and comfortable. It takes around 45 mins to Seoul from the airport. You will arrived in Main train station in Seoul, so easy to get to other cities."
Convenient but half hour wait in between,"If you are heading to Seoul Station, this is a fast and convenient way to get there from Incheon Airport. However, you will have to factor in the wait time in between trains.The seats do not recline or if they do, it's minimal. I couldn't get mine to move even when the button was pressed. As such, they are not as comfortable compared to the limousine buses from Incheon Airport."
Is not so express. ,Yes is better than other kind of transport but is not speedy. It makes 50 minutes for 50km it is the same thing than a car. But it is very clean and the people who works there are very cool and friendly. 
"Ticket purchase is cash only, unless...","Unless one pays for two tickets per passenger from a sales counter. Tickets machines are only cash only. This is clearly to scam foreigners. It is hard to believe that in 2018, the use of card purchases is not common, especially Korea is somewhat a technical advance country. Such a shame..."
Cheap yet comfy transport from Incheon Airport,"It was easy and comfy taking AREX from Inceon Airport to Seoul City centre. The train is clean, and always on time."
Good means of going to Incheon Int Airport from the City,"The hotel I stayed provided free shuttle service from the hotel to Seoul Station and from Seoul Station I took AREX to Incheon, I flew with KE, hence AREX was 8000 won from Seoul Station to Incheon."
Comfortable,We used the express train from Seoul to the airport -- was very convenient. It took 43 minutes. Everyone had a reserved seat.
"Infrequent, limited stops...",Not sure how efficient this service is since the service only runs every 30++ minutes and it only stops at Seoul Station making it very inconvenient for people heading elsewhere. Badly designed. AREX should learn from AEL in HK.
AREX fast and comfortable,"The AREX 10 stops train from ICN airport to Seoul central station takes about 55minutes. It is clean,comfortableand cheap at less than 4usd. Using a T-money card is convenient, just place the card on the reader pad at the entrance gate and again on the card reader pad at the exit gate from the station. The trains run every 20 to 30 minutes. It is an excellent service."
AREX Seoul fast and convenient,"Fast and convenient airport express train to and from city centre with reasonable price. My personal opinion, not recommended for those traveler with many luggage as you need to walk a lot of stairs or escalator for transfer from nearest station to seoul station."
Convenient and great value to the heart of Seoul,"AREX has two services - a non-stop that has nicer seats and costs 2.5x the local service (but still quite reasonable). And the commuter service that makes a half dozen stops or so before reaching Seoul station. Both are clean, reliable, and nice A/C (which is important on hot summer days). Very reasonably priced for the distance covered. The only complaint is the operating hours are not the best for early departures and late arrivals from and into Incheon airport."
Excellent Transportation System,"Best way to get from Incheon Airport to Seoul. If you want to get to the city and no take a taxi, AREX is the perfect solution. This express train is fast, efficient, and clean!"
"Fast, affordable and comfortable","This is the best transportation between Incheon Airport and Seoul.I definitely recommend for foreign tourists who visit Seoul for the first time.- Much cheaper than airport limousine bus. And hardly delayed.- Popular stations in Seoul: Gongdeok, Hongdae, Seoul Station.- It had been running with many vacancies. But, quite crowded lately. And even commuters are hopping on.- There are non-stop trains. But, they're more expensive and not running frequently."
Straight Shot,"Highly recommend the AREX to get to the Airport. Dedicated line that's a straight shot to the airport. The awesome part is that you can Check-In, Drop off your bags, basically do everything you would do at the Airport, at the Subway station. BRILLIANT. "
Non-stop Express Train Between ICN Airport and Seoul Station,"I took the AREX Express train from ICN Airport to Seoul Station when I arrived in Korea and I took the same train back to the airport when I left. Seating was comfortable with plenty of leg room. There were luggage racks in each car. You get reserved seating when buying a ticket. There is free wi-fi on the train.If you flew on Asiana Airlines, you also get a discount on your ticket. Make sure to recycle your ticket at the end of the train trip at one of the kiosk to get a 500 Won refund. Train ride between ICN Airport and Seoul Station was only about 45 minutes each way."
Rapid Service.,"The Airport Railroad Express (AREX) is clean, convenient and user friendly. We had some difficulty to buy the tickets in Namba Station as you have lots of railway station there. If you have time, please locate the ticket office before if you are leaving early. They have nice staff to help you."
Train is okay but station facilities are not so ,"I like the idea that the train depart and arrive on time, without worries on traffic jam. However, the check in facilities as well as Tran frequency can be improved. You must take note that, if you are traveling with Korean Airlines, you can check in only up to 3hours 25minutes before flight departure. I tried checking in at 3 hours 18minutes, and the check in lady bluntly say No, even though the place look empty. Honestly speaking, if I am allowed to check in before purchasing the ticket, I think I’ll be 3 hours 30’before departure. I really don’t understand how such timing will benefit us. what should I check in so early and arrive Incheon with 2 hours plus of timing. "
The 'All Stop Train' is the most economical way to travel,"Looking at the facts there is little to gain taking the express train to/from the international airport into Seoul, the All Stop Train takes a little longer but there is a significant financial gain, money that can be put to better use on holidays. On our recent trip to South Korea we followed the signs from the new terminal T2 to the train station, here there were several ticket machines available, they were easy to use, in English, and easy to navigate to make a purchase. The machines take cash only, at completion of the purchase you are issued a plastic train ticket, a deposit is included in the ticket price which is refunded at the end of the journey: look for a refund machine just outside the turnstiles. The train journey was comfortable, plenty of seating and space to put your luggage, from Seoul Station we changed to the metro system with ease. Wonderful efficient public transport."
Easiest way to get to and from the airport,"The trains are fast, super clean and ultra smooth. Hard to believe there was a war in this country less than 70 years ago."
Fast way to get to and from the Airport ,"AREX in the fastest way to get to and from Incheon International Airport in Seoul, South Korea. To go to Incheon you must go to Seoul Station, get a ticket for AREX, take the elevator to go to the bottom floor and get in the Express Train. To go from Incheon to the city just look for the banners that say AREX or Express Train and get a ticket.I also took the Metro from Incheon to Seoul and I’d rather take AREX although it’s much more expensive, it’s faster, more convenient, clean, and clear."
Smart inexpensive quick way to heart of Seoul,Used this service saved time and money. The hotel buses (which the hotels always recommend) forget to tell you if you are stop one or eight of many hotels before leaving for the airport. If you dont mind this or having to find the station entrance for the express train to Incheon airport in Seoul Station this is by far the best way to get into town.
Best Way to Get from Incheon IA to Seoul and Vice Versa,"I can's say enough about the A'Rex Express train. The trips from and back to Terminal 2 (International) at IIA were clean, fast, and inexpensive (about $8). Trains arrive in and depart from Seoul Station. The trains run on time. No worries about traffic or anything else. Very simple to use."
Superb way to travel from Incheon airport to Seoul Station,"Getting to the Arex station upon arrival at Incheon airport is easy,though it does require some walking. Just follow the signs. There is not much difference in travel time between the non-stop Express and the ""all-stop"" train, the all-stop runs more frequently and may thus be the quicker alternative. No need to buy tickets in advance (indeed if you are in Seoul you can only buy tickets for the current day)..the Express train has numbered seating while the all-stop train does not have fixed seating."
The best ,The best and fast way to go to Seoul from Incheon airport take only 45 min and cost 8$us dollar to Seoul main station and from here you can travel around South Korea also Metro to Seoul city anywhere you want to go !! Or from main station also have free bus take you to your hotel in the city you can ask them !! Very nice service and friendly too 
To the Airport,"We booked tickets the day we needed to get to the airport. The ticketing area is located on the far end of Seoul Station, just keep a look out for the signs. We had our luggage taken to the airport so we would just need to pick it up from there. After getting the tickets we went out into the city one last time to do final eating and shopping. It was easy enough to come back, get on the train and then head to the airport to catch our flight."
Convenient and Easy ,It's the best transportation way to reach Seoul City from Icheon International Airport (and vice versa). It's comfortable and has free WiFi. Very nice. 
Works perfectly ,I have used this a couple of times now and it’s super easy from either T1 or T2 to get a non stop train to Seoul Station. I paid 8000won and your there in 30 minsYou are allocated a carriage and a seat noWhat more can you say does exactly what you need! 
Excellent metro linking Incheon to Seoul as well as Gimpo! Very cost efficient and quick!,"Really enjoyed taking this express train from ICN to Seoul. They have the same line that does stop at all stations (all stop) that we used a lot to take from Seoul to Gimpo airport. The price you pay per ride (non peak) $1.25 was a steal! Very good, clean, on time and efficient method of transport."
Korean splendure,Use this train for journey to city Seoul.ticketing easily bought thro vending machine. And easy to to up. Signage clear with english. Fast. Took the all stop just to see the vrowd. Splendid adventure. Stay in Naksopyeong. Very good atea with plenty of shop and public transport.
"Cheap, Efficient Access To & From Airport","There two rail options to get to and from Incheon airport & Seoul - the rapid non stop one or the 10 stopper.We chose the latter and in hindsight wished we paid the extra money and went with the express since you're guaranteed seating.The journey on the slower multiple stop option takes about an hour - it's definitely not fun standing up for the majority of the ride since our train was packed.Incheon airport is located quite a distance from Seoul so even electing to take the express option still takes 40+ minutes.Either way, I'd probably recommend paying the extra money and going with the express option."
Easy to use,"This is fast and easy, very clean. If you plan to use the subway in Seoul there is an app that works great. "
Either AREX or Airport Bus.,The A'Rex is the most mainstream option of transportation to/from Incheon Airport and Seoul. The ticket vending machines calculate the cost of travel based on origin and destination. Always clean and safe.
Check-in at Seoul Station,"If you are taking Asiana, Jeju or Korean Air, you can check-in at Seoul station (check-in, immigration check, and luggage transfer), go shopping then take the express train (prerequisite) to ICN (same day only). This service is free as long as you take the express train I highly recommend checking in at Seoul station (or Coex) even if you plan to go straight to ICN as there can be massive queues at ICN and this pretty much gives you a priority pass. I paid 7500 won but you can get cheaper on Klook, wish I knew!"
Easily Accessible,"AREX Airport Railroad Express is more than just a convenient.Registered on Klook to have the ticket reserved and have it printed out. Followed the directional signage from Incheon International Airport I and headed to collect my ticket. The express is location opposite the airport which is accessible through underpass, about 5 mins walk. There is a deposit of 500 won required.If you are hungry like me back then, there are some fast food chains / convenient store for you to get some food and have them in the train.- Remember to throw away and do not leave any litter behindThe platform is 1 level down and they will leave on the dot as mentioned on your tickets. Do not throw the receipt / ticket away. After you have reach your destination, don’t forget to get your 500 won refunded at the machine. Remember to book on klook before your trip as first, it is cheaper and secondly, you can save some time. CheersJazlyn"
Simply Superb,"Travel on this super fast train from downtown to airport on return journey was a great experience that travellers need to share for others .The ticket cost Korean won 9,000 per person and of this Korean won 500 are refunded when you alight at Incheon International Airport on completion of journey .Buying a ticket is a must for downtown check in counter of airlines at Seoul Station .After you hand over your luggage it takes less than a minute to do immigration clearance .When you arrive at airport you go through fast lane of those who have checked in the downtown Arex .It is a seamless travel that needs to emulated by other countries for ease of travel and quick clearances at airport .Wish I would have taken this train to go to Seoul station when I arrived You can taken Golf Car to go to your check in counter / elevator free of cost .Full marks ."
"Simple, Fast and Convenient","A great service. The 45 minute journey from Incheon Intrnational Airport to Seoul is fast and comfortable. The Express service is 9,500 krw (compared to bus - 15,000krw) and is very easy to find and buy tickets."
Korea vacation ,The train station is very clean and we use Arex everyday to go to Seoul. The Train is very fast and the seats are comfortable. Wish we had this kind of train in our country. 
"For the price, it is excellent","I have travelled on this train a lot of times and have used any number of transport methods to get to Incheon airport having lived here for nearly a decade. As Seoul has huge traffic problems, using public transport should be cheap, quick and efficient and the AREX most definitely ticks all of those boxes. Unlike the Arlanda Express, using this train won't bankrupt you."
Business Trip,"Took the train on arrival and again on my departure. I have been told it is slower way but is cheaper and is easy to use. I went from Incheon to Gimpo and then transferred to the #9 line, same platform. The one thing that suprised me was there are Express Train and all stop trains, so make sure before boarding which is the best option. Service and Info Desks are very helpfull and all spoke good English."
Trip to Incheon,"For a single trip 2 people from Seoul station to Incheon airport terminal 1 it costs a total of 19000 ₩. This is for a 45 minutes express, with 500₩ refundable at the end from a ticket machine.We found that for the additional comfort of your own comfy cushioned seats, plenty of leg room, luggage and overhead space it was worth the additional fees.I guess this would depend entirely on the person. We had a long 24 hours flight ahead of us and any extra comfort would be much welcomed.When you have paid for your ticket, keep your receipt as on the top left corner will be your car number and seat numbers.If you paid for single use card, then you also will receive a credit card sized orange card to scan in and scan out through the gates. Make sure you keep these as you will need them to exit at your destination. All in all, a pleasant and peaceful ride with no need to squeeze and struggle through what would've been an hour ride into terminal 1."
Fast and efficient!,I took this train last year during 12 hours layover in Korea. I’ve never went on this train until last year and the train was fast and clean; it also has wifi running through the train. I went to Seoul Station to meet up with my buddy and the commuting time was short and fast. Chairs were comfy too.
"Fast, Clean and Convenient.","It helps us. Makes it cheaper buy it from baynaru.It was really convenient and on time!!! Would really recommend it. Easy to book and use, fast and efficient.not all stop train, airport 'Express' train!"
Excellent service - use it all the time,The Arex is a great way to get to/from the airport very cheaply and also if you live on a connecting subway line an excellent way of getting into Seoul quickly without the hassle of bus/taxi or lots of stops.Advice - if you need a taxi at Seoul station take exit 15 (towards KTX) the taxi stand there often has a short or no queue and if you are headed up towards City Hall/Gwanga-mun they don't have to go 2 kms to do a U turn to go back
Good transport,I used it once instead of a bus. Although I was expected to be faster than the bus I found it slower. Bus still remains the most reliabme way to reach the airport.
Best ICN transport choice!,"I always use AREX when visiting Seoul. Recommend checking the timetable closely as sometimes the trains are not so frequent meaning you have to wait. If you check the timetable, you may be able to spend the wait time in a coffee shop or doing something else."
So nice,So proud that Korea has great transportation. Great price and quite comfortable. Very efficient and well organized.
Airport Transit at It's Finest,"The AREX EXPRESS train is a superb way to get between ICN and downtown Seoul. It is only a 43 minute train ride making no stops, and the seats are very comfortable. These AREX 1000 series trains are still relatively new as well. I did not take the AREX 2000 series trains (AREX ALL STOP train) but it looks like any short haul commuter train. I will certainly be riding the AREX EXPRESS train the next time I come back to Seoul!"
Fastest way to get to Seoul from the Incheon Airport,"You need to get a transportation card and fill it up with some cash or get a single way ticket to get on board.From the Airport to Seoul station, it takes about 55 minutes with the express train. Note that you can also take the all stop train with few minutes more to your trip.Its very convenient and worth the price.I tried the Taxi and the AREX and on my next visit i will for sure take that train."
Best way to Incheon ,"Just a caution note that they don’t accept credit cards, else most convenient way to and fro Incheon. "
"Easy, convenient and inexpensive","Since 4 if us were travelling including a 12 year old, we bought group fare for about 26000 ₩ (including ₩ per ticket refundable at machine after the ride). An adult fare was abt 8500 ₩. The car and seat number will be printed on your receipt, not on the card. Please keep the receipt. My son can't find his travel card as we want to exit at the airport station. Luckily we still had the receipt. Baggage storage area by the door is more spacious than KTX but rack space for big bags are limited. Smaller bags can be kept above your seat. TheWifi wasn't working on our train that morning. Ride is very smooth and quiet. After you redeemed your travel card at the exit of the station, take escalator towards departure terminal. There will be an intersection - left, straight or right. See sign on the pillars which way to go for your airlines. Have a safe and pleasant fight. "
Efficient means of travel,The Airport Railroad Express is a very efficient and inexpensive mode of transportation where one can use in traveling around South Korea.
Quick and Convenient,"We were told that the express train was not worth the expense, as it was only about 15min faster than the all stop train. But we took the express train anyway, just for the experience. It was a quick and convenient way to travel between Seoul Station and Incheon Airport. There was a long walk from the drop-off point to the Incheon Airport departure area. Luckily we were offered a free lift, perhaps because we were travelling with kids. Do remember to get your 500 won deposit refund on arrival."
Best way to and fro Incheon,Comfortable and affordable way to and fro Incheon airport. Super clean trains and very on time. Free wifi onboard. 
Excellent service ,"This connects you to Seoul Metro system. It was fast and efficient. Clean and inexpensive. Under 5,000 won to get to Seoul station and beyond. Would take this again!"
Quick and convenient,"This is a pleasant and fast means of transport from Incheon airport to Seoul with a seat reserved ,so everybody has a seat. The price was 8500 won. It seems there is a possibility of getting the ticket a bit cheaper but language barriers made it difficult. It was however easy to get a refund of 500 at the end of the journey as there was a machine for this at the station."
Fast and easy,"Super fast and easy connection between the Incheon airport and Seoul Station. I think it goes to the other Seoul airport also,Gimpo. Easy access with big suitcases with the elevators. Inexpensive. Spacious."
Fantastic,"We took the AREX train from Seoul City West to Incheon airport. What an amazing and stress free service. Ticket purchase was easy and staff were easy to communicate with. They offer city check in for selected flights (5 airlines) so we didnt have to battle with luggage on the train. Our boarding pass was issues there too. The train was clean, ran on time. Such a treat! So well worth the cost!"
Fast and convenient,"The Airport Railroad Express (AREX) is a very quick and convenient way to travel from Incheon airport to the central station in Seoul. The cost for an adult ticket is 8,000 Won (equivalent to about GBP5.60 Aug 2017). Children fares are 6,900 Won. The non stop journey takes about 45 minutes. There is another train – the commuter line which takes about ten minutes longer – but this stops at ten stops on the way – and costs 4,500 Won (equivalent to GBP 3.20 Aug 2017).The trains are clean and efficient. The seats are very comfortable on the express train compared to the commuter train. There is overhead storage for smaller, carry on sized luggage. There is also room for larger sized luggage at the ends of each train car.They usually charge an additional 100 Won on a one way ticket. Also, you need to remember that there is a deposit of 500 Won added to the ticket which you get back from the refund deposit ticket machines at the destination station of your journey."
Fast and convenient way to go to downtown Seoul or Gimpo,We had a connecting flight to Jeju and we have to transfer from Incheon International Airport to Gimpo Airport. This is was one of the recommended ways to get to Gimpo fast and cheap. Efficient transport.
Quick way into the city,I took the AREX multiple times to get to the city. It is such a comfortable and picturesque ride during the day.
"Useful, could be better","No need to worry about traffic, just sit and relax for 43 minutes and you can reach Incheon from Seoul. It would be better if you could check-in at Seoul Station, they do that for limited airlines. No trolleys available on arrival at Incheon."
"Cheap, fast and convenience","this is one of the fastest non-stop transport from airport to seoul station. price without discount is 8500korea won, certain airtix and online offer discount at 6900won. comfortable and offer allocated shipping"
"Brilliant - fast, easy and cheap.","Just follow the signs as you exit the departure area. It's a walk of a couple of hundred metres and past a few fast food stores but is worth it. There are a couple of ticket sales booths on the way and at the station itself some vending machines. The one way fare to Seoul Central railway station is about USD 8 and the journey takes 50 minutes. By taxi it can be much longer than that - and is often more than USD 75, depending on traffic. The train is very modern, clean and fast. I arrived on a Saturday evening and had almost the entire carriage to myself. It was a bit of a walk to get out of Seould station, which seems very deeply buried, but that's a comment not a criticism."
Depends on...,"This is a very convenient and safe transportation between airport and the city, but the convenience depends on which part of the city of Seoul you're going to and from which part of the city you' leaving for the airport. Please check out your destination and departing place before you buy a ticket for the express train."
Fastest and most convenient ,Got this too and from the airport. Cost 8000 KRW and takes about 40 mins. Leaves from Seoul main station. Comfortable. Free wifi. Starts early and runs late. Check website for exact timetable. I find this a better option over the bus if you are staying in the city centre
Super !!!,The way is comfortable and quiet and there are good seats. We can see the landscapes trough big windows
Best Way to Get to Seoul,"I was very happy with my choice to use the AREX train. I used both the Express (limited) and Commuter (all-stop) trains during my stay. I would say that this is the absolute best way to get from Incheon International Airporrt to the heart of Seoul. I took 45 minutes for the express train and 1 hour for the commuter train which is very reasonable since driving would be the same amount of time. The tickets are affordable and you can easily locate where to buy tickets and take the train with signs in English, Korean, Japanese, and Chinese. There are also bi-lingual staff available to help you. If you already have a T-money card, you can also use that to go through the gates."
Seamless and Fast,"The quicket way to travell between Seoul and Incheon Airport, 43 minutes between destinations and you can opt to book a seat."
No fuzz no issue & end to end in comfirt,For a bit more in fare ( there are discount fare if u ask at counter ) then standard train. You reach Seoul station in 43min non-stop.Good option for traveler that's time concern or have a schedule to meet.Comfort twin seat per side and good legroom for the whole travel. 
Very Efficient,Took the train into town from Incheon airport. Follow the train signs when you arrive. From International Arrivals it's a right turn. About a 10 minute walk and located below the airport arrival level. There are automated ticket dispensers located near the entrance. They take cash only. They have an English button which changes the screen to English. Pretty self explanatory for single or return journeys. If you get a single journey the card is refundable from a machine near the exit. 500 KRW. Getting around is simple and all the maps are in English. Trains are air conditioned and very clean. Specific seats for pregnant women with frequent announcements in 4 languages to remind you. All stops are announced in 4 languages including English. Also digital reminders of the stops in English as well and a moving map. I took the train that stops on the way to town as we were getting off at Hongik University. Price was 4750 KRW. The express train doesn't stop and takes 44 mins to the centre of Seoul. Best affordable way to get to town!
"Fast, Easy & Comfy!","We arrived in Incheon Airport & had to travel to Seoul Station to grab our train to Busan! So we took the AREX from Incheon Airport to Seoul Station. We didn't rush & took our time to find the AREX location. Because we had this booklet from the Korea Tourism Organization from Malaysia, we had a discount coupon that gives us 1500 won discount from 8000 won to 6500 won. This is by far the best discount for AREX. At the ticket counter, if you are in a group, they will also give you some discounts. So always ask to see if got discounts if you purchase in a group.No hassle when we boarded the AREX. Free wifi & comfortable seats. There are seat no on the ticket but we didn't realised it as we were a little flustered due to the fact that we just reached Korea!!! Train was not very full hence the so called ticket conductor didn't chase us to our appointed seats. Overall, great experience with AREX!"
Fast and comfy!!,For those who want to skip all stops from Incheon to Seoul city centre. It's fast with comfortable seats. At 8K won definitely costlier than the normal metro but saves at least 45 min of journey. 
Always on it !,Yes I take it whenever I am In Seoul as it provides great check in facility for Korean Air. Reasonable price and comfortable. Strongly recommended 
Convenient,"The easiest, fastest and most convenient way to get from Seoul/Inchon Aiport to the city of Seoul. It runs every 30 minutes, cost of 8,000 won one way plus a refundable 500 won deposit. It's reserved seating. It's never crowded, and cars are very clean. It will take you to Seoul Station when you can transfer to Subway Line 1 and Line 2. "
Workes great,Clean and fastest option between Incheon and Seoul station. Make sure to use the express line if your traveling between incheon and seoul station.
Visitation ,"Very rapid, convenient from Incheon International Airport to Seoul. There are many line which one can transfer easily to places we like to visit. The trains run very timely. Comfortable and reasonable price."
Perfect,"On arrival we took a limousine bus to the city, but when we left we took the AREX to the airport. Far more relaxing than the bus I must say. The seats are reserved, the compartments are clean and the service is good."
I love it!,"The train is clean, quiet and offers a speedy transportation from the airport to Seoul station. It's the only way I would travel from the airport and the ticket price is very reasonable. The amount of time saved is definitely worthy of the price. "
The Best Way to Move from Airport to Seoul,"Once upon a time, foreign visitors had to stay a day at least in Incheon because it took long time to go to Seoul from Incheon International Airport. Thanks to AREX, however, visitors or tourists can directly go to Seoul without staying in Incheon. Around 1 hour, you can reach hot spots of Seoul, such as Hongdae. Take the express and save your time during your visit to Korea."
How to get to Seoul from Incheon airport,"A quick, clean regular service operates between the airport and Seoul main down station where you can connect to all subway lines. For us it was easy to use, buying tickets for the non stop service (as opposed to the 10 stopper) at the counter on the day for W8000 each, with a refundable deposit returned by the vending machine at the other end. Check online time tables as services run every 30-40 minutes depending on the time of day.Thanks for the vote if you found this review helpful."
Convenient but a little confusing,"The arex is an.express train that runs between ICN and Seoul station. Takes 43 minutes and costs about USD 8 per person each way.Train is quiet and comfortable. Finding the train at each end can be difficult, but staff at each end are helpful. Make sure you say AREX or airport express. "
No Fuss but Fast and Efficient!,"My family were staying in Seoul and had an early flight (10:00 Depart) to catch from Incheon International Airport. It is well known that the check-in to Immigration area at Incheon Airport would be notoriously packed during morning peak and hence we need to take one of earliest AREX Express train (from Seoul station) and reach Incheon Airport station before 08:00 to leave ourselves at least some time allowances. Went to B2 of Seoul station and bought tickets (cannot remember exactly what time the train departed the station... should be around 07:00) at AREX counter. The train departed on time and the whole journey was smooth and comfortable. The train car was not packed and there are still a lot of empty seats available. More importantly, it arrives exactly on time (this one i remember clearly 43 mins to be exact) at the Airport. Express Train Ticket price: Adult 8,000won Child 4,000won; one cannot reserve seats days in advance before travel date but there is no need to anyway, since we notice lots of seats are available."
Great and comfortable way to travel.,"Easy to travel from and to the airport. Has wi-fi on board, comfy seats, no traffic jams.We were using it all the time."
Excellent way going to the Incheon Airport,AREX is an efficient mode in going to the Airport from the center of Seoul. Its very comfortable even if you have heavy luggages.
affordable transportation connecting Seoul & airport,"Leaves airport from level B1. I travelled Fri. afternoon, - train was extremely crowded, which was difficult with luggage, & station/stop announcements were difficult to hear. Missed my disembarkIng point, & had to back track. Service seems to have depreciated from several yrs. ago."
convenient and efficient way to get to Incheon Airport from Seoul Station,"Bought tickets at seoul station. Took elevators to platform and waited for the train. Got in found our seats, Very comfortable and clean. Fast train ride to the Airport."
The train was ok but City Terminal is OP,"When departing from ICN, checking at the City Terminal not only allows to drop your bags in the station but you get to use the crew/diplomat channels for security and immigration in ICN. If you are staying near Seoul Station, this is a no brainer."
Train is very good,This train is very fast and is great if you go to downtown Seoul as often as I do. If you live in Songdo It's actually faster to take this train from the airport than taking the bus from Songdo.
Seoul Airport Express Railroad,The airport express railroad is a fast and convenient way to get from Incheon airport to Seoul station. It is clean and relatively cheap and I would recommending using this service instead of using the bus or taxi to get from the airport into the city.
So many stairs to reach the subway😔😔,"It's clean,tidy. So many peoplebut in general normal standard. Comfortable and safetyI think the stops so far from each other. Forexample we sit from seoul to incheon it took around one hour. "
Convenient way to enter or leave Seoul,"Nonstop trip to Seoul RR Station. If you are staying at downtown Seoul, this would be the best way to go under $10."
Touring Cyclists - Home ward bound ,"Using the AREX couldn't be easier. It is well signed throughout the airport, as well as staff posted at the escalators to ensure your on the right path. The train it's self, is fast about 4 minutes to the departure terminal, and clean, like what you have come to expect here in South Korea. Very well organized!"
Love this train! 50 minutes to Seoul without any stops! ,"For anyone fearful of adventuring on their own...don't be! The mass transit system in South Korea & Japan are incredible. In English & Korean the Express train is a bright orange path of signs that lead straight to the platform. The car location is marked on the platform. Assigned seats. 50 minutes later we arrived in Seoul, followed a few signs and got on the subway. Off reasonably close to Gyeongbokgung Palace & Isadong Street. Easy & great way to get into the city. "
"Nice, convenient and fast way to Seoul station. Rude and arrogant staff at the information desk.","The AREX express train is a nice, convenient and fast way to get to Seoul station in about 40 minutes for 8000 won. The girl staff at the information desk was rude and arrogant which does not add up well to the Korea experience especially after Japan where people are so elegant and polite. Korea tourism should train people to behave better at the train station as well at the immigration counter. The immigration character was also rude and distasteful. They should learn from the Japanese in the art of hospitality."
Love Fast Trains.,"The only issue I have with this train is that they it does not come as regularly as the non express. Therefore you can arrive at the airport within 3 minutes as the non express train. Check scheduling, but very enjoyable. "
Convenient rapid transport to Seoul City,A mark of a true metropolis and a world class airport is to have a convenient and affordable rapid transport between the two.AREX totally achieves this objective.2 types of trains are in service:1. An express train to and fro Seoul station with no other stops.2. An all stop train on the same line but connects important transit points to different sub urban areas in Seoul. It stops at Gimpo airport ( for domestic flights to Jeju).
This is what I learnt this time...,"If you want to use the Airport Express and Seoul airport check-in service, first and foremost, do not be late.Korean Air, Asians Air, Jeju Air and China Southern provide the check-in service there, I am not sure about other airlines.The check-in counter will accept your luggage if you are minimum 3 hours before your flight. Sequence will be to purchase a ticket (be early, the queue may not be long but there will always be people being clueless and asking many questions, so if you are rushing for time, be patience), then proceed to immigration counter next to ticketing counter and then to the check-in counter for check-in and luggage drop. You will need to wait around 10 minutes for security to scan and clear your checked luggage before you proceed to the train.3 things to point out, 1st - car 6 is free seating, if you purchase a ticket then then need to change the timing, the counter will likely just amend your receipt and ask you to proceed to car 6.2nd- your ticket entitle you to a 500krw refund at the airport using the refund machine. But there will be staff offering the same service. He or she will be carrying a tray with some coins. Just put the ticket into the tray as gesture and he/she will give you the refund, otherwise the machine will take much longer time.3rd- the immigration at Seoul station will just stamp your boarding pass. With this stamp, you will not be taking the usual route to outbound immigration at Incheon Airport. Before you enter the lanes to the checkpoint for boarding pass, there will be a smaller opening on the left side along the control area barricade. Just ask around if you do not understand what I meant,In short, do not be late, it is a simple and efficient service."
Convenient--Plus Check In for Flight at Seoul Station,"AREX has an express train to Incheon Airport. And did you know you can check in for your flight directly at Seoul Station (Asiana, Korean Air, and Jeju Air only)? So convenient--plus you get to go through shorter lines once at Incheon Airport. You can check in your luggage and either hang out in Seoul longer before heading to the airport or go to the airport and hang out there (lots of shopping and cultural things to do at the airport--plus a relaxation area on the 4th floor that is free).How to check in for flight at Seoul Station (see photos):1. Go to level B2 of Seoul Station.2. Go to your airline and tell them you will be purchasing AREX tickets to the airport (they will give you a voucher so you can get 1,000 won discount).3. Go to the orange AREX counter. Buy your AREX tickets. Ours were 7,000 won each with the discount. Give yourself at least 30 minutes from when you are buying the tickets so you can check in and go to immigration and make the train on time (we had about 7 minutes to spare and we got our tickets 30 minutes before departure).4. Check in with your airline if you are more than 3 hours before your flight. You can check your bags here. 5. You can go to immigration just to the left of airline counters 10 minutes after checking in. Pick up directions on what to do at the airport.6. Going through immigration is super fast!7. Head to the AREX train.Once at the airport, there is a ton of things to do: shop, watch a cultural performance, ice skate, watch a movie, etc.When you are ready to head to your gate, you get to go through a special entrance reserved for diplomats and flight crew! So easy and fast. The regular line gets long. - After the security checkpoint, you can go to the priority fast lane to go through immigration quickly.- Then head off to your boarding gate. - Once in this area, there is still a ton of shopping you can do.- You can also access the free lounge area one floor up. Showers and relaxation chairs upstairs."
Fast and Efficient ,I use the AREX Express all the time and it's a perfect service to and from Seoul Station at a very reasonable cost.
fast transit,"AREX is a fast train from Incheon Airport to Seoul city, it takes about 40 minutes to reach Seoul there was no stop in between."
Best way to travel to and from the Airport,"Do not use the bus, (Limousine), or a taxi from the airport, Inchon, into downtown Seoul. Use this airport express train service, 8500won and it takes about 45 minutes from Inchon to Seoul station. Easy, fast, clean and cheap.Follow the signs, buy your ticket and go wait for your train to arrive. I will use this again."
Amazed with the Serrvices,Best Transfer Services Ever had everything is exceptionally perfect Speed and the comfort is unmatched servicesreally hats off
Fast & Efficient,Great service spacious and half the time to travel into city center. The stopping train takes forever especially if you are anxious to arrive at your hotel and explore the city.
Very good! ,"It's direct and from the airport to Seoul station it's 43 minutes - normal metro takes around 1 h and 20. There is wifi on board , seats are assigned on the receipt , and it's very clean. Ticket is 8 krw."
convenient,i use this train for when i going to guest house . this train not many people using .so even i have two big luggage it's no matter for me. do not need using for taxi
take this to the city only 4000 to 5000 won,This is cheaper than the limo bus but it takes about the same time as the bus. 3 times the prices you save if you willing to walk from mrt to hotel. unlike the kal limo bus it drop you off in selected hotels.
Excellent option,"As everywhere else in Korea, AREX offers a great option of public transport. Extremely clean, efficient, fast and free wifi, hard to find anything like that around the world!"
South Korea number 1!!!!,"Reluctant at first, but totally discouraged from the crazy taxi cab prices and bus wait times, I decided to give this train a try. I must say this is the most convenient and fast way to get from city to city and town to town avoiding the traffic. Exceeded alot of expectations. I must say not only South Koreans are great people and have warm hospitality towards foreign tourists, but they are extremely high tech and skilled in this transportation field. America are you listening? We need Transit like these folks like Now! AREX- 15 stars if I could."
The fastest way to Seoul,"The train is fast (only 40 minutes), cheap (~US$10) and clean. It also runs to a reasonably frequent timetable. You need a seat reservation for a specific train so you can't really book a return trip (unless you know the exact time) from the airport but that's fine as it's the same price anyway.The train also has fast free wifi and clean toilets onboard.Finally also note there is about a 5 minute cut off when they stop selling tickets for the service so for example to catch a 10:30am train you need to have bought your tickets by 10:25am."
Fast and clean,This train is fast and clean. It will get you to the city faster than any other transport option. The only problem i encounter is the lack of storage space for luggage so we ended up holding our luggage to prevent it from sliding away.
Very helpful staff,"Aside from the AREX being very efficient and fast , you will also experience how hospitable and helpful the Korean people are. I asked one AREX staff at the Seoul Stop if he knew where I could find an adaptor to use to charge my mobile phone , what he did was to offer me his Phone charger to use and it did not end there , he apparently went around the convenience stores in the Seoul station and asked around that he went back to where I was and with a smile and in broken english informed me that he found where I could get an adaptor. Not only that, when I was paying for the item at the store and he heard that it was 14,000 korean won ( i dont know if that is expensive or what) he spoke to the cashier to cancel the sale and instead changed the item to a cheaper one since he said that was all I needed. Unfortunately I was not able to get his name ... it is enough that I experienced Korean warmth and hospitality through him."
Outstanding transport facility,"On my current visit to Seoul, I decided to stay at the Grand Hyatt Incheon close to the airport and take the AREX Airport Express downtown for Seoul Train Station close to Seoul's business district. A world-class facility, convenient, quick, clean, fast, friendly, helpful, bilingual staff. Inexpensive at KW8000. All-round superb."
Direct and convenient way to get to Seoul Station,Convenient way to get to Seoul Station and then changed to subway lines to most popular stops like Dongdaemun.
Best transport from Airport to Seoul,"If you've never been to Korea before you may not know that the Airport in Incheon is very far from Seoul. So, when looking for a way into the city the AREX is your best, and cheapest option. The trip is under 30 minutes and the trains are nice and comfortable. The AREX pulls directly into Seoul Station with access to the Seoul Subway station or trains that continue on to other major cities such as Daegu and Busan."
Fast and comfortable ride from Incheon airport to Seoul city centre,The entrance to the train station was easy to locate as you can spot it after exiting the arrival hall. Get your T-money from the convenience store located near the entrance and top up your card at the machines right before the gantry. The train is wide and comfortable. The only thing that is lacking is areas to put your luggages. You would have to keep your luggage in front of you and hold on to it lest it rolls away from you when the train move.
Great quick transportation into Seoul,"There are two types of the Arex train into Seoul. One is the ""all stop"" train and the other is the ""express"" train. The all stop train stops at about 9 stops along the way into Seoul and it takes 50mins from Incheon airport to Seoul Station and cost about a little under 5000won for a one way trip. REMEMBER to get your 500won deposit back for the card since they include that on the ticket fee. You can get your deposit back by looking for the refund deposit machine as you get pass the ticket machine scanners. "
Super convenient from airport to Seoul city centre,Comfort and fast ride. Super convenient from airport to Seoul city centre. This is the best way get from Incheon International Airport to Seoul.
Most systematic and advance transport.,"Airport Railway express @A'REX is the most convenient type of transportation in Korea.It is not only cheap but fairly easy to travel with from station to station.There are two types of train,express train travelling from Incheon intr'l airport to Seoul and the other one is all stop train which makes a stop at every station between Incheon intrl' airport all the way to Seoul.The fare is quite cheap to a Malaysian standard like me and you can easily buy the ticket from the vending machine located at the station.My advice just buy the train ticket rather than using the T money which can be reloaded whenever you card is running out of cash.For budget travellers and to those who wish to visit Korea,my advice is,get the train,it is not only cheap but convenient type of transportation and it will take you to your destination on time."
Dependable,Ferries passengers to the airport. Heated seats. Can be crowded during peak. Personal space is not required. But it will get you there
Family trip to Kimchi world!,We took the Arex train upon arriving Incheon airport to the city of Seoul. It is very convenient but a bit crowded since it is the public transport with lots of stops along the way. If you are looking for a budget train ride this is the one. Otherwise you may take the KTX train which is a non-stop train to Seoul but will cost you a bit more. You'll probably be standing for a couple of minutes but once it reaches some stops you might find some empty seats to enjoy the ride. It runs from the airport all the way to its final stop in seoul central station. From there you can choose which train that will take you to your destination around the city. 
Insanely Fast,The fastest and safest and most punctual way to go to Seoul from Incheon Airport. You can either buy express one or normal one. Very clean too.
Fast and cheapest way to get to Seoul,"Using the AREX is very convenient. It is very fast and very cheap at KRW8,000 as compared to the bus or taxi. The seats are very comfortable and there is even free wifi. The only downside I see here is the travel from Seoul station to your hotel when taking the subway especially if you have big luggages. Some stations do not have escalators. (I guess this is should be another review.) It would be much more convenient to take a taxi from Seoul Station to your hotel. "
Very convenient,"Very cheap, convenient, and comfortable mode of transportation. We used the AREX to transfer from Gimpo to Incheon and we had no trouble knowing which way to go because there are signs everywhere that are in either English or Chinese. It could get quite challenging especially if you have a lot of luggage with you as you will go down several escalators, but there are also a lot of walkways which makes walking much faster. South Korea's transportation systems are really effective and efficient and we love it!"
convenient,"AREX is a convenient rail/subway option for getting from Incheon Airport to Seoul if you're unable to catch an airport limousine bus directly to your accommodations. We used it late night, and there were many people on AREX. It was easy to navigate as an English speaker. T-money is a reloadable card that is an easy way of paying for this transportation so that you don't have to fiddle with money right when you want to get on. If you have some funds left on the card at the end of your trip, you can use it to buy snacks and get a refund with what's left at the major convenience stores ."
Cheaper mode of transport ,Not too difficult to figure ur way ard as there are English and Chinese words to where u wish to go. Also the staff wud be able to help you although their English might be limited. If you have google maps it wud help as the names of the places u are goin to wud have Hangul(Korean alphabets) a taxi wud cost about W80.000-100.000 but the metro is about W5000-8000. Or u can take the airport bus limo. 
Quick and fast transfer from Incheon,"Finding the station, getting the ticket was quick. The platform was nearby. The journey was smooth. It was last then 45 mins to reach. Signs to the exit was very clear. On the other hand, not sure it is because I arrive on Sunday afternoon as there was very little crowd."
"quick, even has internet","comfy, loads of room, quick, clean. great service. this is how public transport should look like everywhere!"
Really comfortable and cheap,"This has to be the best way into Seoul from the airport. It's quick and really well priced. We paid the equivalent of £10 for two people.You also get to see a bit of the landscape as you come in.It's easy to find in the airport, well sign posted and find staff are friendly.Theres is also free wifi! "
Make sure you go to the right ticket machines,"I've been travelling to Seoul for years, if you want the cheaper (50%) tickets on the express that stops everywhere (10 stops to Seoul) then make sure you go to the left side of the terminal station. You will be cleverly led by signage and design to the more expensive direct trains (8-9,000 won) first on your right. Please look across to your left and see the Arex machines for the standard train (about an hour competed to half hour in journey time) but the same tracks."
You will arrive once you blink your eyes. haha kidding,Totally recommended for who want quick access to the city till Seoul Station. The ticket price is 8000 krw. The interior so clean and their staff full of good manners.. really loves the uniforms that they wear.. so neat. Cozy chair for short journey.
Easy and quick into Seoul,"Direct into Seoul Station, central in the city. Or take the local service, which stops at multiple stations along the way. Both are more comfortable and cheaper than the bus services. Way much cheaper than a taxi."
Faster than the normal train by 15mins only ,"The AREX is faster than normal train not by a lot. If you arent in a rush, take the normal train as its a lot cheaper. "
Convenient way to travel,"Abt 45 mins trip from ICN to Seoul Station.Convenient, cheap and comfortable.Might be a better idea to get it from the ticket machine from Seoul Station next to the ticketing counter for a discount of ₩500"
Comfortable way to travel from Incheon airport to Seoul city.,"Quick, clean and inexpensive form of transport to Seoul city from Incheon international airport. 7,500 KRW one way, 43 minutes travel time and you are given a specific seat. Plenty of space for bags.Will use on way back to airport."
Best and not expensive transportation from Airport to Seoul City,It's very convenience to take AREX from Incheon Airport to the Seoul City with not expensive price. Just only less than 1 hour and you can reach Seoul Station. 
What a ride!,"We arrived at Incheon International Airport late afternoon from Okinawa and caught the 6PM express train to Seoul Station. The train was on time, very clean, assigned sitting, with free fast Wifi. It was also cheap @ $5 for the 30-minute ride. Great service for travelers heading to Seoul from Incheon airport."
"Fast, clean, smooth ride with free wifi","Cost 8000 Won from Incheon to Seoul Station. Ticket can be purchased from counter next to the entrance, & it takes only 43 mins. There is another non express train as well so be sure to get the right one. You can also check in luggage from Seoul station on your way back & it will send it straight to airport. The wifi on board is free & very fast, but was disconnected when in the tunnel."
Very Easy and Cheap,Took the AREX from Incheon International to Incheon City Station very fast and convenient. The AREX also goes to Kimpo International also so the connection between the 2 airports are very easily accessible...Quick and Easy and very comfortable...
"Great service, easy to use, clean and safe","By far the best train/subway system we have ever used. It was easy to buy a ticket, we were assigned our own seats. The station and train was extremely clean. To top it off they had a steward there to ensure we were happy during the ride."
Thumbs up for AREX!!!,"I took the non stop train from Incheon Airport to Seoul Station. it takes around 30+ mins and seat assigned. This is fast and very easy to access for tourist but it cost 8000won per pax per way. I've booked online, i got the code and exchange the train ticket at the arex counter in incheon airport. The train is quiet and clean, Wifi is speedy.From Seoul Station back to Incheon Airport, bear in mind, if you are taking Emirates or Korean Air (please check with the Arex Website, there are few more airlines availble), you could check in ur luggage and get it at ur final destination which is very convenience yet got the express way to go through the immigration custom when you are Incheon Airport. Its fantastic!! But if you need that service, you need to have at least 3hour time distance from ur flight depature time."
Not cheap but fast,It's not cheap but get you to Seoul downtown fast. Do bear in mind that once you alight many stations have no escalator or elevator so those with heavy or bulky luggages have to plan properly.
Great way from Incheon and Gimpo to Seoul station,"If you are heading to Seoul station fr Incheon, take the AREX. The train is clean, fast, convenient and has seats assigned. There's free wifi. Clean modern toilet in car 4. There are ways to pay less than the W8000 (see attached pictures). If you are headed for Gimpo instead to transfer to domestic, take the 'All Stop Train'. The signs in the airport is clear and easy to understand. "
Great Train ride,"The nonstop to Seoul from Incheon airport was a fantastic train. Very clean, quiet and dont have to fight for a seat as you get assigned one. Train was fast and got me to Seoul early enough to do a day worths of sightseeing."
Super convenient ,"Just finished taking the AREX today and I wasn't disappointed. Paid the fare of 6,900 (discounted with KE boarding pass). Jump on the first train out of ICN (0520) and it was empty. The wifi connection was strong and the seats were comfortable. What more can I ask for!"
Clean and efficient,An easy way to reach center of Seoul from airport. Took only around 43 minutes to reach Seoul station or back to the airport. Trains were clean and comfortable. There were specific timings available. Make sure you check it out at their website. Some tips are tickets purchase from their machine is 500won cheaper than purchasing at the counter. There was also a booklet about AREX near the ticket gate that had 2 adult discount coupon for AREX tickets (around less than 7000 won). 
Easy to book and the express train is very peaceful,"the train has a luggage cart in the back of the train, the seats are adequate and leave legroom for taller riders."
AREX,"Great way to move from Incheon Airport to Seoul Station. The All-Stop train has like 12 stops from all point to another, including Gimpo Airport and Hongik University. By the way I took the AREX last Monday Oct 10th in the afternoon i left my bag in it. Still looking for it tho "
Great way to get to Incheon Airport,"Have used this transportation numerous times to get from downtown Seoul (and further south in Korea) to the Airport, and vice versa. It only runs from Seoul Station to and from the Airport, so to get there from elsewhere in Seoul or Korea, you may have to change trains from Yongsan Station if you're coming from the southwest (a taxi from Yongsan to Seoul Station is easiest for me). Cost of ticket from Seoul Station to Incheon is about USD 7. Train is nonstop and takes about 43 minutes. Trains start running about 6AM and end after 10PM. Of course the train runs both ways."
Airport-City transportation,"Clean,comfortable way of travel from ICN airport direct to the centre of the city for good price. Free wifi available in cars. "
Fabulous train from both of Seoul's aiports,Just another fabulous train in Seoul's train system. For a few bucks you can get into Seoul central quickly and safely. Bravo Korea on a brilliant transport system.
Fast and efficient,Fast and efficient. The connection to the subway is a bit confusing to one who does not understand Korean. 
Fast track to the airport,"The AREX express train to Incheon airport starts at Seoul Station. At the far right hand side of the station, the escalators will take you a few levels down where you can purchase your ticket. This will give you a coach and seat number so you'll know where to board and to sit. The train is quiet, clean and smoothly makes its way to the airport - a long time is spent underground but finally you get there and delivers you right to the airport and you can make your way to departures or arrivals - as you wish. Overall a good ride for W8,000 which is value for money! Beats the busses that have to navigate traffic."
From Incheon to Seoul at ease!,"Once you reach Incheon Airport, simply look for the airport railroad sign it will leads you to AREX platform. There are express train and all stop train. I took the express train from Incheon to Seoul Station for about 43 minutes. It costs 6000 won per person as we are in a group of four (promotion for group more than 3). I took all stop train from Hongik University Station back to Incheon and cost 4050 won using my T money card. For express train, you will be assigned with seat numbers. I personally think that AREX is the best option to travel to Seoul as it is fast and affordable as compared to taxi and limo bus. Train is clean and comfortable with toilet available. You can check the timetable from AREX website if you wish to plan ahead."
Fabulous service ,Fast and efficant. Love love this train. You can take the express train which is 45 minutes from Seoul station or you take the longer one but it's also still fast with 50 minutes from the other subway stations. It's clean it's reliable and it always arrives on time!
Stations far apart,"The stations are farther apart than on the metro. Wider seats & som accommodation for luggage would be helpful. Also wish the train could go faster, as flat open spaces, little rail traffic. Seemed like 10-15 minutes between each stop close to the airport. "
This is great!,"Don't worry you wont need to fly from any city to soul , you can use train as faster and easier way.I used Arex + KTX from Ulsan to incheon airport. It was great system.Just look at tables, ""airport express rail way"" easy, fast and helpful."
Efficient and cheaper versus other transports ,"Expenses buses and taxi from airport to city centre; luckily the airport link gives a good and cheaper alternative! Two lines running from The airport, direct to main hub in Seoul station and all stops with an efficient interchange to location in Seoul. "
Excellent option,"Wonderful way to get to/from the airport. Fast, convenient, extremely clean and the price is quite reasonable. Korea again offers the best in public transportation."
two train rides in,The train was a good way to move around Korea. Very efficient and fast. After we figured out the stations and airport connections it was easy.
Worth the expense.,"An excellent, if expensive, way to travel into Seoul. Free wifi. It was a bit disconcerting to have TV's which amongst their advertisements had some anti-Japanese propaganda! We felt humbled by the courteous staff onboard the train and their respectful bowing to their customers. "
Easy and comfortable,I was taking a 48 hour break in Seoul and this was my first time visiting the city. There were several things with AREX that really helped me. 1. they can store your unneeded luggage. That way I only took what I needed for the Seoul stopover and left the rest at the airport. It's not cheap but worth it for me. 2. You can get a subway card at a self service ATM-like machine. 3. The train has only a few stops and the quickest way to the city. 4. The people at the information counter are very helpful. 5. When I got to my stop in Seoul there was an information counter with a free map for me. 6. Everything has English and that's handy for me.
Excellent Ride to Airport if...,"Best way to get back form the airport, a non stop express with one stop at Seoul Station. quality service on board, the only thing is you need to time the trip, the trains leave every 45 minutes or so, so depends on when you get there. Overall much better than sitting in traffic. "
Convenient and the easiest way to the city centre,"The price might be slightly more expensive compared to shuttle bus or other subway lines, but it is a very good option to go directly to city center. The train will stop at Seoul Station. For those who are planning to stay within Seoul Station area, AREX is the most convenient way."
Faster and cheaper to go from airport to city.,"The fare is half the cost of taking the bus. Best take train when going to the city. Also, read blogs and maps before taking the train. If staying for 4 days only best to just buy tickets per ride instead of buying from convenience store at the airport the train card with value in it."
great,"Super convenient and easy trip into the center of Seoul using this express train. No traffic to deal with just a comfortable drive and takes about half the time of other transportation methods,"
Railroad is a great way to get around,This was our first visit to korea. We got here at 9 pm. It was very easy to get our passes. We look forward to exploring more of it in the next two weeks.
Would be much better to kindly give guide for taking on !!!,"I always use this Arex after arriving Incheon airport.Usually, their service is satisfied except the case I have to hurry up to catch.When I run fast, I am sometimes confused because I have no idea where the elevator to B level is and which escalator is much closer.Even in the B level, saparated direct and normal train gates also make me confusing.In my opinion, the gates should be merged as one though it would become more difficult to manage by the company."
Reliable service,"Pre-book tickets or arrive on the day, allocated seats, luggage area in each carriage, clean, very reliable and good value 8000 won for one way trip which took 43 mins exactly! Allow at least 10 mins to walk to AREX track from main area in Seoul station. "
"Easy, fast, convenient train directly to Seoul Station.","Incheon Airport to Seoul Station:Bought AREX Express one way ticket + T-money card with KRW2,000 credit to use for subway/buses for KRW8,900 per person (same price for adult/ child/ youth/ senior). Seats are assigned on the train.Bring the T-money card to any convenience store to register as youth, child or senior T-money card to get cheaper fares when you take subway or buses.Seoul Station to Incheon Airport:There are some discounts available when you purchase from the counter. KRW6,000 for 4 persons & above and some airline discounts. You will need to purchase the AREX Express ticket before you go to the Airline counter for check-in.There are some airline counters (Asiana, Korean Airlines) at Seoul Station and you can check-in, collect boarding passes and check-in all the luggages.There is also a immigration office to get your passport stamped at Seoul Station (next to the airline counters). There will be a special queue at Incheon Airport if you already have your passport stamped at Seoul Station.Seats are assigned on the train."
Quick and simple way to get to the aisport,It is a very quick and simple way to get to the international airport.The only problem is that ticket mashines do not take credit cards.
"Fast, cheap with T-Money card","Airport Express Railroad is the fastest way to go airport I think if you don't have helicopter. And cheap.Before come Korea search from Internet about T-Money card. If you are planning to stay around one week , it is good idea to buy that card. And don't worry you can return back I guess. Sure you can get in airport because Koreans are good at this kind of arrangement.Otherwise each your subway trip you will spend time at ticket vending machine."
Express indeed,"Yes it is an express to Seoul.Safe, fair price and convenient. This is the only best way to go to seoul in a hurry and without any hassle "
Excellent connection between airport and downtown Seoul,"Modern, convenient and hassle-free train service. A one-way trip takes roughly an hour. I noticed that food and drinks aren't sold on board so bring some as necessary."
Airport transportation ,"Very convenient way to get to and from the airport. Runs on time and regularly. Quite inexpensive as compared to the buses, cabs, etc. Unless your destination is far off the transit lines, the AREX is the way to go. Then again, catching a cab after you get into the city would be quite inexpensive. "
During Rotary Convention ,Relatively fast way to get around the city with most tickets under $3 can buy tickets at their machines click English option not use 1000 won notes as wont accept 5000 won notes. Price includes 500 won deposit which you get back if use the refund machine very helpful to have a printed map to plan your route found that very useful vending machines at most stops. Stops are well marked in Korean and English as well as spoken over the loud speaker almost all Koreans On board. Some stops have food and shopping were as some have mallsMostly underground but some trains come above ground 
Efficient,"Of course you can take the metro to central Seoul. But if you have more than a roll on, you are better off using the airport bus. The bus driver will store the big luggage in the baggage compartment."
Fastest Transportation to Seoul from the Incheon Airport,"Think of a Bullet train (but not a fast ;-) . the final drop is at City Center in Seoul. If its your fist time to Seoul, take a map as you exit the train station. It can be a little confusing finding your return train entry point. "
Best way between city and airport,On the ground floor of the airport you can buy T card from the book store or any combine. And then walk down and take this train to city center.
"The only better way to get to downtown Seoul from Incheon airport, is to beam yourself there.","We landed at Incheon Airport after a series of delays and mess-ups by Cathay Pacfic. And we were really not looking forward to travel by train to Seoul. We just wanted to dive into a taxi and ask him to take us to the hotel. Thank God we didn't. The Airport express train from Incheon to Seoul (Yongsan Gu) tool all of 43 minutes. And it was one of the most comfortable journeys ever.  (A taxi would have taken us 70 minutes.)Express trains have 272 cushy front facing seats to help you sink into them. They have the 2 + 2 configuration. The train itself is not crowded and getting your luggage on to it is simple. There's enough storage area with the overhead luggage shelves and the additional luggage racks. Passenger compartments are separated from door areas and from transitions between cars by transparent sliding doors. The train has seats for the disabled and are equipped with LCD screens for passenger information, including flight arrivals and departures. Another bonus: all the info is given in English as well. When boarding at the airport, take the escalator or elevator down to the B1 floor. And then follow the sign that says Airport Railroad. Or ask someone. In the basement, a 3-minute moving walkway that leads to the AREX entrance. Ticket kiosks are available on either side of the entrance. The cost per adult was 15,500 Won. At Seoul station, you'll find taxis lined up to take to your destination."
A breeze to get tickets in English.,A very good way to get to airport from Seoul to Incheon. Easy to locate ticket kiosk and people are very friendly and willing to assist you 
Excellent,"We purchased our T-money cards at the G25 convenient store at Incheon Airport (4000 won each) and loaded them at the same time with money (you can load it at the self service subway machines also which has English language function). Tip: If you aren't in a rush don't take the express train to Seoul from the Airport as it's much more expensive than the all-stop and you don't save that much time anyways as every stop is only about 1 minute long if even that.The train is extremely clean, always on time and very easy to navigate."
Express train to Seoul Station,"It's quite easy to access to railroad once you arrived Incheon International airport. The signboard is very clear to direct you to the ticketing and train area.They have counter and vending machine for ticketing. They have schedule for express train, attached is the timetable. The ticket is 8,000 won per person, your train number and seat will be indicate in the ticket.But there right and left side of entrance, make sure you enter the correct one.The seat of the train quite comfortable to ride on.Once you arrived Seoul station, it's your choice to buy a T-Money or single card. As for me, I felt paying 3,000 won for the card not worth it as we only in Korea for few days. The T-money card not refundable, it's better you go to subway machine and choose whether you want to buy single, rechargeable card. If single card, once you arrive your destination, you can refund 500 won each card.I bought the T-Money card as the lady at the information counter told me to do so. And they not really friendly and helpful, so make sure you are smart!"
express,ride airport express train from seoul to incheon airport after my 5 days vacation in Seoul. The time of departure and arrival are followed. The train is clean and very comfortable.
"Inexpensive, clean, efficient","So long as you allow sufficient time and have cash for the ticket machines, it's pretty straight forward. Don't forget to recover the KRW500 deposit on the ticket after your last journey.60 minutes to Seoul, 90 minutes to Songdho near Incheon."
"Seoul, AREX (Airport Express Railroad)","If you are are planning to go straight to Seoul station and the surrounding, hopping into the AREX would be a best bet. Getting the ticket was easy while the ride was fast and convenience. The train is also consider new and clean."
It really takes its time to arrive Incheon Airport... / AREX,"Not being the first Airport Express suburban train I have used before, AREX sounded really astonishing. Yes, it goes FAST but not fast enough if you are in a hurry. AREX schedule was built to do ONE Hour from Seoul Station to Incheon Airport, but only 25-30 mins to Gimpo Airport. Please consider this if your flight schedule is tight because you will need at least 2 hours to arrive Incheon Airport, from any nearby location inside Seoul."
Best way to and from ICN,"What a breeze. 5th trip over here, first time using Arex, won't be my last. Seoul Station is excellent, Service and assistance from Arex crew was outstanding. Couldn't imagine using any other service on future trips over. "
Excellent Experience on AREX,"AREX offers special promotion for groups of 4.Service staff are helpful and fluent in English.Train service on time, clean and comfy with sufficient luggage space."
Normal Train is OK,The nonstop train don't make much difference in saving time than normal train.. But it was quite and fewer people.
It's a train,If time is not vital use the stopping service. It's about half the price of the express. The terminus is at the main station which is around 3 or 4 stops on the metro from most areas of interest.
Incheon to Seoul Station,Comfortable and fast ride to Seoul Station without stops. 2x2 seat. Luggage rack/storage infront of every cabin so you don't have to hold your big luggages.
"Efficient, Reliable & Great!","Took express AREX. Service is very good, comfy seat & legroom, stewardess available for help, spacious toilet. Train is on time. A must experience for all :)"
Fantastic Service,I use the airport express all the time and it is excellent. Always clean and on time. For me it's the best way to get to Incheon.
Direct connectoion between Airport and Central Station,"Fast, clean, cheap and easy to use. The only problem is finding a taxi at Seoul Central Station. Seems that there are two ranks, the main one in front of the station and another at the side. To get to my hotel, The Westin, catching a cab in the front means the cab needing to go 4/5 of the way around the station which took over 20 minutes in rush hour traffic). If you take the train, ask your hotel which cab rank to use."
"On time, efficient and cheap transportation from SEL Stn to Incheon Intl Airport","Took 30mins to travel from SEL Stn to ICN Intl Airport via AREX with stops on every Stn.Considered cheap to travel via AREX that cost KRW 4,850/pax.Luggages can be placed inside the train car."
Efficient and reliable,Thumbs up! Rides were pleasant and staff friendly when approached for directions and information. Will definitely recommend to friends and family visiting Korea
Modern and fast trains,"If you're taking Asiana Airlines, there is a discount for this train (as of 2015). It is mentioned in the airline magazine you must show your boarding pass. Ride was smooth and easy to navigate to the heart of the city. "
Comfortable Ride to Seoul Station,"I arrived at night and good thing that I was able to catch the last express train to Seoul at 9:40pm. Although, there is an All Stop Train that goes to Seoul Station until about 11pm. I've tried the All Stop Train before since I had to go down at Hongik University Station. If you are going straight to Seoul Station, it is best that you take the Express Train which will take you about 43minutes. Difference from all stop train is just about 13mins and it just costs 8,000won.Leg room is way better than economy airline seats or even premium economy airline seats. They have a storage area for luggage. You just have to be early though so you get a space. There are discounts tied up to group purchase and airlines. You can check their website for details. Promos may change from time to time as well."
The only way to travel from ICN to the city,"I highly recommend taking this train to and from ICN if you can. It is faster (if you ride express) and cheaper than a taxi. We took the express train to Seoul Station after arrival. It costs about 6900 won for a ticket. You can pay with a credit card if you haven't had a chance to get Korean won yet from an ATM. Seats are assigned and are very comfortable. There is free Wifi on board with a great connection. The train was very punctual. It was a 43 minute ride from the airport to Seoul Station. On the way back to the airport, I had a relatively early flight leaving at 8:30, and took a taxi. I regret it now, as I now know would have had plenty of time to check-in, go through immigration, and make my way to the gate if I had taken the 6:00 AM express train."
"Easy to use, information posted in multiple languages","We took the AREX from Incheon Airport to Seoul Station. This was going to be significantly faster and cheaper than taking a taxi. We easily found the train station in the airport, and the ticket kiosks are clearly marked. We were able to select different languages to use the ticketing kiosk as well. Once we purchased our ticket, someone who worked for the AREX showed us where the train platform was and which side of the platform our train would arrive on (so we didn't get on the all-stop train instead). The train cars were clearly marked so we were able to find our assigned seats quickly. This would be a trickier trip with lots of luggage, but we just had small carry ons. Would recommend using this train to get to and from the Incheon airport to Seoul Station. Our hotel was conveniently located closely to the station, so this was our best option. "
Fastest way to get to central Seoul,"I usally take the KAL bus to central Seoul, this trip I decided to try the AREX as its only 43 minutes (they weren't kidding). Now depending on where your staying/going in Korea this may not be a good fit, but I stay at a hotel directly across from Seoul station so this is perfect. Only cost 8000 KRW, train was clean, comfortable and enjoyable. Can't wait to use the AREX again in April and in May."
Clean and comfort,깨끗하고 빠르다. 캐리어를 끌기에도 좋다.다만 너무 깊어 환승 거리가 너무 길다.Clean and fast. Good to bring your carrier.But too deep so you have to walk so long.
Cheaper than bus,"Pro - only 8k for the ticket (compare to 15k for bus ticket); very fast, clean, free wifi onboard, easy to access. Con - bus will drop you almost in front of your hotel (different hotels/areas choose different bus routes at the airport please, very easy to find your right route)"
Efficient way of travelling to Seoul downtown,"I re-visited Seoul in less than half a year and I used AREX, bringing me from Incheon to Seoul downtown. The travel time was less than an hour and there is free WIFI in the AREX."
Best way to get into Seoul,Leaving Seoul you can check your bags at the airport offices in the Seoul Station before taking the 43 minute ride to the airport luggage free.
Easy. Fast. Good value.,"No need to know Korean to take this train. English instruction can be selected. Takes you directly to/from Seoul Station, which is the main train station in old town Seoul."
"Convenient, clean, and fast",We rode the express railroad into Seoul to take a quick look around before catching an evening flight at Incheon airport. It was very easy to get on the train. Please note that your ticket has a reserved seat assignment.
AREX is AMAZING,"AREX is by far the best for travel between Incheon Airport and downtown Seoul. Convenient access from the baggage claim direct to Seoul Station in 43 minutes is great. Very comfortable business class style seats with luggage storage close to the doors, and clean bathrooms on board as well. Once arrived at Seoul Station transfer to the metro is simple or access into downtown near Namdaemun Gate is right out front."
Fastest way to Seoul Station and ICN,"If you are staying anywhere near Seoul station this is the best way to get to and from the airport. Instead of paying W15,000 for the airport Limo, which are great if you are going to Gangnam, pay W8,000 for the Airport Express and then hop a taxi (not the black and yellow expensive taxis) to your hotel from Seoul station. There is a better taxi stand behind Seoul Station that will save you time and money."
THE way to get downtown!,"I really enjoyed riding the AREX from Incheon. The express train is fast and reliable, and, at 8000 won, a real bargain! Connections are easily made to Seoul MRT lines. Who could ask for more?"
Cheapest way to Seoul station,"AREX Express Train is the cheapest way to get to Seoul station from Incheon International airport and it takes less than 1 hour. It is the cheapest way but not the most convenient way. If you don't have a lot of luggages or big luggages, I would strongly recommend this option. The time taken for Arex is about the same as taxi (but have to depend on the traffic and is much more expensive - taxi). AREX costs you about 4150 won (using T-money card), taxi costs you at least 60,000 won and airport luminous bus costs you about 10,000 won or more.If you have big luggages or a lot of luggages, taxi may be a more convenient and comfortable way to get to your destination. Otherwise, AREX is a good choice."
Comfortable AREX,Buy your T-Money pass at 7-11 if you arrive at Incheon before 9 am. AREX ticketing desk opens at 9 am only. You can use T-Money pass to access to AREX.
Recommended Transportation from Airport,"If you're travelling to Seoul in budget, make sure you catch Arex from Incheon because this one is the cheapest option to get to Seoul from airport. It's really comfortable tho, if you dont bring too many luggages, Arex will surely be the best option for you. "
"Fast, clean, and satisfying trip","I highly recommend this train if you have extra money. It was fast, clean, and very on-time. BUT! if you want to see more view of Korea, how Koreans are behaving when they ride the train, the stations, I recommend you to just take the normal one. "
Wonderful Incheon airport express train,"If you are heading to Seoul station from the Incheon Airport, you should definitely take the Korail express train (about 45 min). Then from Seoul station, you can take the local subway or the KTX train (bullet train to Busan or other cities). The KTX train station is the building next door. Just follow the signs."
Great way to get to Seoul from Incheon,Simple and fast way to get to seoul from Incheon International airport for a small fee. Comparing prices cheaper then taking a cab but still slightly more expensive to then taking a airport limo.
"A Fast, Easy Option","We used Arex to get to downtown Seoul and back during an eighteen hour layover. Both trips were problem-free. Big signs at the airport and Seoul main train station took us to the ticket office where the staff was very friendly and helpful. (They spoke excellent English.) Equally clear signs showed us the way to the train. We paid the extra money to take the express train, so the trip took about 47 minutes, one way. The train itself was comfortable, well-lighted, and quite clean."
cheapest and most convenient way to get to your hotel in seoul.,"since i would be arriving late at night, i studied different options on how to get to my hotel(insadong crown hotel) at insadong. first option, thru a travel agency back home costing about US $60/person to get to the hotel. second option, by taxi which would cost about US $60/trip. third option, airport limousine which would cost US $ 13/person. fourth option, airport express US $7/person or the multi-stop US $4/person.although, the travel agency and the taxi would be the most convenient way to get to the hotel, it was quite expensive for me. i would have wanted to take the airport limousine which actually is a bus service at stops at certain subway stations in seoul. but could not make the time as it's last trip was beyond our schedule as we had to pass thru immigration, baggage claim, customs, money change, t-money and not the least a pocket wifi. so we were left with only one option, that was to take the airport express. we were not able to catch airport express' last trip(non-stop) and had to use the multi-stop airport express which was half the fare but the trip is about 16 minutes longer. btw, the air port limousine, depending on the traffic could take up to two hours to travel to downtown seoul while the airport express takes only one hour. we only did one transfer at gongdeok station and proceeded to line 5 (purple line). very easy convenient and indeed the cheapest way to get to our hotel."
"Easy, fast and convenient",The Arex shuttle is very easy to use and cheap. It makes life convenient when you need to travel between Seoul and Incheon Airport. It's much faster to take the Arex than a bus.
best connection between airport and city,"I used AREX express non stop train service. At 8 USD, it is much less costly than taxi that may take approx 45-50 USD for one way trip to city and may be longer time due to traffic. This is convenient way to travel."
Connect to Seoul airports,"Very conveninent and fast mode of transport between the two Seoul airports, Seoul Station and city.you need to buy ticket on a machine, and get 500 won back when you return the ticket while exiting.Easy to move with luggage to the Rail Platform. Dont take the Express for change of airport !!!"
An alternative to airport bus,"I have taken Arex a few times before when I had layovers in incheon. This time around i had a 26 inch luggage which made meandering around Seoul station a bit tricky. First of all, Arex is located on B 2 level at incheon airport. Once on the level, you can buy the ticket at the ticket booth. I opted for Arex because it has no stops in the middle. The final destination is Seoul Station. The journey took 43 minutes one way. The tickets have pre-assigned seats. Train interior was comfortable. Luggage racks were limited. The fact that not all doors opened at the same time made boarding difficult. Bathroom was spotless though. Once I got to Seoul station I had to lug my luggage up and down a few long escalators. Signage was not clear and even locals were asking for directions. It is a nice alternative to taking the airport bus. As long as you are traveling light, it should not be a problem. "
Fast and fuss way to get to city area,This is one of the fastest way to get to the city area other than bus. Bus will take you to most of the stops just outside of your hotels but there might be jams at times. 
Fastest way to seoul,It takes about 43 mins to arrive at seoul station from incheon airport. Ticket fare is 8000won one way (if im not mistaken).
Best way into and out of Downtown Seoul from Incheon,"Very convenient way to get and from Incheon Airport. $8.00USD one way into/out of Seoul. Express train goes directly from ICH to Seoul Station in 45 minutes. From Seoul Station, you can connect to Line 1 or 4 of Seoul Metro, which will enable you to most likely get to your final destination. As an alternative, getting a cab from Seoul Station will work, too. "
Good way to Incheon International Airport from Seoul Station,We checked in our baggages at Korean Air counter at the Seoul Station and went on board Arex. We arrived Incheon direct in less than one hour.
