Good National museum with various exhibits.,"C ( 19.08.02 ) This museum was well-managed with various exhibits, garden and roads, I think. The museum was national facility, so free for enjoying. There had many and various exhibits, and beautiful buildings. The exhibits was similar with another national museum, but there had unique atmosphere. Good to enjoy about Korean history."
Especially good National Museum,"Ahh the National Museums of Korea - most cities have one - and if you've been to one of these before you know the drill: you're here for the pottery, celadon, stone daggers, funeral urns and bronzework. Having been to several National Museums in Korean cities, Gwangju ranks near the top. Very interesting special display of items recovered from a Chinese ship that was wrecked on course to Japan in the early Joseon dynasty. There is also information available on Mahan, which I had not found in other museums.The grounds and building itself are superb! A pleasant place to wander on a hot afternoon. The friendly groundskeepers shared pomegranates with us :D"
Small and quaint museum,"Like most museums in Korea, the museum offers the similar range of display with specificity on Jeollanamdo. Starting from pre historic era, agriculture, Buddhism display, ceramics and the Sinan shipwreck display. Some are without the English explanation but most of them comes with it. The lion light pagoda is at the centre of the museum and well display. It is one of my favourite item from the museum."
Very nice worth for visit,This place is worth to visit as you will know about korea life in old age. Free entrance well arranged.
Nice afternoon walking thru the history of Korea.,Not a bad museum. It has a good display of Korean historical artifacts. The staff was really nice and we got some nice stuff at the gift shop.
Good art .,"Good art show on that time, some kinds like period exhibitions. the problem i face here, too noisy in this museum which kids and teacher , talking inside the museum , some kind like education . and those kids are running here and there inside the museum. I can`t concentrate good with those noisy. "
Small but interesting,Despite its great building it is actually a small museum which can be visited in less tan an hour. It was reopened in 2009 so it has modern installations and its quite interesting
Not many exhibits,"I have visited seven national museums in Korea, including this one. Compared to others, the exhibit is not really extensive and a bit patchy. I have done looking around in just one hour or so. Still worth a visit and other good museums are within walking distance. "
Very knowledgeable and friendly staff,The Gwangju National Museum has 4 exhibition rooms on 2 floors. Of particular interest is the Buddhist art hall as many of the relics have been found locally. What sets this museum apart though is the staff. We were greeted by exceptionally friendly staff who are clearly passionate about what they do. On the second floor we received a guided tour by one of the curators who was very knowledgeable. All staff we met seemed to be well versed in English as well. It is free to visit the museum.
