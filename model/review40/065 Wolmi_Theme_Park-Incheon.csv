Old and small theme park in Wolmi island.,"C ( 19.08.15 ) This park was old and small size. But there was landmarks in the wolmi island for a long time. There was many facility for fun, but that was not for adult but children. If with children, there was very exciting place, I think. Funny theme park in the Wolmi island."
"empty theme park, what is queue?","on a weekday before dinner time, the place is literally a dead town. very minimal visitors are around, therefore you have the theme park generally to yourself. the rides generally look old, but the vikings struck me as the most fun - followed by the disco pang pang (which is more fun if you understand korean cos the dj will be interacting with you as he's the one controlling the ride). it gets busier as time goes, so yep. it's free to enter, but you have to pay KRW 5,000 to play a ride"
Fun,The rides are fun especially the viking! Not recommended for young kids as the safety precaution facilities seems rather old and poorly maintain.
Riding Rides,A place with a lot of rides and huge scope of entertainment. Both for children and adults can enjoy the rides. A must visiting place for a family tour. There are a lot cafe with local market.
Cheaper than Everland,"Cheaper than Everland. But less fun for sure. For some short fun. Closes at 10pm, seeing the sunset here is fun. "
Great day at a fun park.,"Varied activities, to wack-a-mole, very interesting sculptures abound. On the water side, live entertainers and typical carnival rides made for a family or DATE friendly atmosphere. Plenty of inexpensive places to eat as well. Very much worth the visit."
just a trip,it's a nice place just considering a place where to go to have a walk near the sea.of course appropriate for teenagers and family.I had been visited this place only for curiosity and because i had time!
"A theme park in Wolmi, Incheon",It's quite a very small theme park if we compare with other theme parks in Korea. Most of visitors are Korean teenagers and Korean family with small kids. Not too much rides to have fun.
Especially for kids,"Just go if you have kids, this is for sure they will have fun!This place is just very nice next to the sea!You can find a lot of snacks, but also restaurants with extra fresh fishes and seafood"
place for teens and kids,"visit only if you have a kid, they will love it, the nearby restaurants seems good, eat seafood there, I had one and it was SO GOOD and CHEAP, the theme park is actually nearby the seaside."
Excellent if you have kids,You can have fun with your kids... Couple of nice coffee shops and restaurants... There are many places where you can have fun as well..
