"Beautiful museum, not too overwhelming, and very interesting","This museum takes about 2 hours to cover. It's very pleasant, and the exhibits are clearly organized. Beautiful modern art."
Small and quite geeky,Terrific little museum with a strong emphasis on the interface between Art and technology - as might be expected in a city like Daejeon! Nice cafe too.
Carmen ballet ,"The venue is great, seats a great for the price, we saw Carmen ballet and it was beautiful. Prepare to take bus/metro after the show gets done, taxis were scarce after the show. "
Cool!,Worth the visit. The building itself is interesting. It is located in the Daejeon Exposition Park by the river. The subway stop is about a 20 minute walk. There are a few buses that stop closer. 
Delightful,"Currently the DMA has a fabulous exhibition with modern art from the Asian Pacific; here until October, if I'm correct. (I went earlier this year and their works of local Korean artists was good as well.) It's a small, cheap, place with a lovely store and cafe, and helpful staff. If you go slowly and take it all in, including the grounds, you'll enjoy yourself. (I recommend a day of it- with exploring the Expo park nearby.)"
DMA,"Around the Arboretum, the Arts Center as well. Exhibitions go the whole year. Would definitely go back."
Art,"Some may find most accessible cultural experiences centered at Seoul. But if you manage to open your view wider and look into other medium sized cities, you may find very surprising gems.Tired of seeing masterpiece replicas hanging on the wall?Frequently Seoul museums curate better quality replicas but Daejeon Art Museum sometimes surpasses those Seoul counterparts by actually organizing genuine masterpieces!Stay tuned!Some exhibitions may really surprise you!"
"Good Museum, with some English explanation.","I enjoyed this art museum. It had some interesting pieces, and it was also good to see there were lots of local school children there too!"
wonderful place,it is most hot place in the city. I can see some exihibition almost every day. also good to young couple to date
Nice displays but smaller than expected,"I thought for ₩10,000 the art museum would be larger, but there were only four rooms (unless I really missed something). Definitely combine visiting this museum with touring the Hanbat Arboretum, which is right next door. The current display at the museum is hyper-realism, which was very interesting. Just wish there had been more..."
Great exhibition,"It's a great Hyperrealistic exhibition at the Daejoen Museum of Art with an important group of artist from different countries around the world, it goes until Dec 20/2015"
"Peaceful, park-like, but kid friendly","Love it, small but very very nicely done, take a walk around the area, and the open park-like atmosphere"
Make a day of it with all the other things to do surrounding the museum,"the museum itself is small but cheap and in most cases worth an hour or so of your time. The exhibits change every few months and the basement has more kid friendly/hands on exhibits...or at least it did the last time I was there...the best thing about it is all the other things within a 5 minute walk including another small art museum, arboretum, bike rental, playground and splash pad."
good range of exhibit and managebale scale,We saw a collection of 20th century art - just the right amount of exhibits to be interesting but not overwhelming 
Picasso Exhibit,"I went for the Picasso exhibit that will be up for a few more months. It is a part of the Phillips Collection from Washington DC. There are pieces from Degas, Van Gogh, O'Keefe, Picasso, etc. Its a great exhibit. The museum is located in a great area too. I took the train to the Gov't stop and walked about .5 to 1 mile through a park. It was pleasant. There is a bunch of sculptures around the museum that are pretty cool. Definitely worth checking out. Bring a blanket and hang out for a while. "
Not terribly exciting,"The museum lies next to the ridiculously huge government building complex. It is forbidden to take pictures inside. The museum doesn’t seem to have any permanent display, apart from an ugly mountain of TV sets in the entrance and from the sculptures outside. The current exhibition is about America, with some good paintings but there are only four rooms, so the ticket price (10000 won) is a bit excessive."
