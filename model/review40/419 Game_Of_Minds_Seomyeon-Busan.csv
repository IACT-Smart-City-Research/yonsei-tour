Dark magic room,A place worth spending time with friends. The rooms are well planned and the staff were helpful. We had so much fun and would definitely visit again.
Dark Magic room,"Our group are a well travelled team of escape artists and we very fond of the Dark Magic room. Our escape experience was actually supposedto take place at a different escape company, however due to taxi difficulties we arrived late and they no longer held our reservation. We found that there are numerous other escape rooms within a 5-minute walk of their location. We were informed that Game of Minds had rooms in English so headed on over. The staff were friendly and helpful and luckily had a couple of rooms available for us to try.The Dark Magic room is of medium difficulty, but very well constructed with a lot of effort placed into making it seem like you are in Harry Potter's world. We were out in 30.03 (the fastest time of the month), and enjoyed the experience. Things inside the room were well translated into English.Would definately visit here again!"
A fun night out.,"My coworkers and I were looking or something fun to do and decided to do an escape room. We used their website to make a reservation and showed up a little before our session. The staff was friendly and the directions were in English, so with somebody help from the staff (CCTV cameras and English audio hints) we were able to complete the escape room."
An amazing escape room experience,"We had a really fun time here, we played the ""Dark Magic"" game, and we enjoyed it very much, there were some ""elements"" that made the experience even better. And after we finished they took a photo of us in some theme related costumes with our finish time and printed it without any extra charge."
A couple fun rooms.,"We are a couple of escape room enthusiasts who have done 40+ rooms in several countries. We did the Harry Potter themed room (four stars), the Davinci room (four stars), and the VR room (two stars). The VR was an interesting novelty, but we didn't especially enjoy it. Of the other two I think we liked Davinci more, though the Harry Potter one was fun as we are fans."
