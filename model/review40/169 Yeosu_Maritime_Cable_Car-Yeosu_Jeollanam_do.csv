Choose the glass bottom,"Traveling to Yeosu was the first overnight trip my family has done in Korea. Our plan focused around the events held at the nearby tea fields, but we added the cable car to the end of our trip. The views from the cable car were great and I would recommend the cable car with a glass base. The park found at one end of the ride was very pretty and had wonderful views of the local scenery. There is a coffee shop with a fun, romantic activity. You can purchase heart-shaped, wooden cut-outs for 5,000 Won and write any message you want. You can then keep the cut-out as a memento or place it on one of the fence posts surrounding the shop. As far as I could tell, there were hundreds of cut-outs hanging from the fence. While the cable car is not enough of a reason to visit Yeosu, it would be a pleasant addition if you plan to visit the area."
nice tourist option,"nice to ride, but cost you about $15 round trip, with option for clear bottom view car for additional fee."
A great ride over Yeosu,"The cable car is definitely worth trying. Unless you are afraid of heights, be sure to choose the ""crystal car"", which is a car with a glass floor. It costs 22000 won per person for a round trip (the standard car costs 18000 won) but it would not be the same experience without the glass floor. The view of Yeosu from above, however, might be a bit underwhelming. Still, worth checking out."
Amazing!,"I loved this! Althought the lines were long, it was definitely worth going on. If I remember correctly, you can either take the elevator, or go up a looong set of stairs. It was the dead of summer time, so we took the elevator, which made the wait even longer, but it made it that much more worth it. The view of the water and the city and everything was amazing. I have so many pictures to share, but they are on my Korean cellphone. If you come to Yeosu (and you should!) definitely come here!"
So fun!,"Ok so this was really fun! The lines were long, but the views were amazing!. I was nervous at first, but that went away. Fun thing to do to see the beautiful water!."
Fun,"It’s a long wait. But you can get a good view of Yeosu/Dolsando (bits, anyway). There’s not a whole lot to do in Yeosu so why not??But between railbike and cable car, I recommend railbike first!"
site closed,The site is closed for repairs. it looks like a worthwhile trip but check it is open first. The taxi driver dropped us off at the site and it is a long walk to the turtle ship that was also closed for repair and the ferries had reduced service.
Summer family trip to Yeosu,"It was a nice and relaxing bus trip from Mokpo to Yeosu. After settled in the hotel haven, we called a cab to the cable car. The areas around the cable car has lots of path to walk around. We see mostly Koreans rather than foreigners. The night market has good food as well."
Nice view,"Nice view at night, comfortable. I will go again this summer when I go to Yeosu. I recommend to all people."
Nothing special,Normally when you take a cable car you expect to have a nice view but here nothing special. It doest not take much time to cross the sea. The view downstairs and in front is quite ordinary.
Exceeded expectations,"I enjoyed the experience more than I had expected. The facilities were new and modern and the views were fantastic. Some great coffee shops and views once you are off the cable car too. Close to everything too. A tip, buy a round trip in the evening so you can go one way during sunset and then return for the night time view after sipping some tea or coffee and eating a red ginseng ice cream."
Impressive experience,"Way to see the view of Yeosu.It was very beautiful, 13,000KRW for round trip, and it is worth trying for sure.It is about 5-10 minutes ride only(one way), it is quite fast and scary at the same time, but overall very good experience.I think it was even better since I took it in the evening.왕복 13000원인데 밤에 타시는것 추천합니다. 여수 야경 전체를 볼수있는데 꽤 아름다워서 전혀 돈아깝지 않음.꽤 빠르고(5-10분)정도 걸림."
Take the cable car for its awesome views!,"Although the ticket price is a bit on the expensive side, the fun and excitement along with panoramic views around the harbor make it absolutely worthwhile. I just wish the ride was a little bit longer. It is a must do for anyone visiting Yeosu for the first time."
Excellent trip whatever the time of day or night,We have taken this trip many times and always enjoy the experience. I was surprised it was steady at the start and entrance when I took my 85-year-old mother on the trip. She loved it. We also got some good advice from some young staff on a great restaurant.
Wow!,Must do this! Spectacular sites. Crosses over the Bay. Suggest to ride back for Fisheries Museum. Don't be nervous!
Night and day view are great ,Both views night and day view were enjoyable on this cable car. There are two options one with normal floor and one with a glass floor which costs more.The cable car goes a LONG distance though the longest I have ever been on. Being still fall in korea the colors of autumn was beautiful!
Soaring high,"We arrived at the station near the Expo site early, and didn't have to contend with long queues at all. The actual experience of crossing the sea and the views from the cable car - amazing. Highly recommended."
Terrible value per money,"It's just a cable car, nothing more. The view is ok, but not great. Too expensive for what it offers"
Very crowded during the summer vacation time.,"We decided to check out this cable car since you could see the entire city from it. I was overwhelmed with so many people and lack of taxi from Dolsan entrance. The ride was short, but the view was amazing. "
Great in the night as well,"More enjoyable than I expected.I could see the night scenery of Yeosu from the cabin and it was great. It was a little different from that on thw Dolsan Park. If you visit here, you can enjoy the coast view of Yeosu.I suggest that you visit at night. You could avoid waiting in line and have a quality time."
simple way to get the downtown ,"in yeosu the mvl hotel, we could find odongdo island and another cable car! it's awesome! just short! clean and fast. modern and safe. they preparwd fast elevator also."
Great experience ,Great experience. Recommended place only in spring and autumn. Too hot for summer weather. Better visit at evening time if u planned in summer. 
Would Be Nicer In The Evening,"Would have been great if I came in the evening. Nevertheless, I'm glad I came. Cable car is wheelchair friendly. "
Why not?,"I don't see any reason to don't ride the cable carts, it can take you to Dolsan Park and to the lower part quickly with nice views."
Enjoy the view,"Don't prebook the attraction, because the ride can be canceled due to strong wind. We were disappointed not to be able to ride at first. We wanted to do in the evening. Because of strong wind the ride was canceled but. Luckly we could hop on right before we left Yeosu the next morning. I guess evening ride would be better but we were satisfied with the morning ride."
Take the crystal cabin type!,We took the cable car with crystal cabin (or 1 grade higher) which has glass panel on the floor. It allowed you to look down at the bottom into the sea and buildings as the cable car hover through them. Not for the faint hearted though.The view was beautiful and 
Gone with the wind,"The cable car will shut down with minimal notice during high wind. So, if you go from one end to the other and spend an extended length of time visiting, you might end up having to walk a long way or take a taxi back to you starting end.Other than that, it offers a spectacular view during the journey. Lots of history at that area, better to learn about it before you go."
exciting place,"enjoyed the place with new friends, cable car provide ecellent view of the yeosu town. a nice place to visit"
Cable Car ride @ Yeosu,"If you are ever in the neighborhood of Yeosu, South Korea make sure to ride the cable car! Beautiful view of the ocean, city, and the Expo area !"
Good!,I took it at night. I enjoyed the view and fresh air through windows crossing over the sea. Parking lots were enough. 
야경보기 좋은곳 Nice place to see a night niew,야경을 보기 위해서 왕복으로 끊었다. 자산에서 6시 30쯤타서 버스킹을 구경하고(7080ㅎㅎ)야경을 보며 내려왔다. 확실히 야간에 사람이 몰려서 8명씩 다 채워서 보낸다.From 19 to 21 is the best in my opinion. On weekend there are people singing and playing a guitar. I love it!
Yeosu Maritime Cable Car,It was a wonderful trip to see the Yeosu ocean beauty from top. Although weather is hot in summers but ocean wind make it feel comfortable. One way and round trips both are available. It is very near with the Odong-do. 
Reasonable price nice view,it is fun to take this car and take pictures. You can see all the city and sea scenery out of there. It is going faster than expected though.
Scenic view from the top,Perhaps the first cable car to cross a portion of sea in Korea The sea view from top is excellent & eye freshening A unique experience that may not be easily available across the globe 
A hill-to-hill ride over Yeosu Harbor,"This is a nice scenic ride over the shipyard side of Yeosu's harbor, between the hill across the street from the MVL Hotel/Expo area, and the island south of Yeosu. The ride was under construction when I visited Yeosu in Sep 2014, so the hardware is only a year or two old and looks well maintained and safe (no implied warranty from me :-). The view of Yeosu's harbor is excellent. And the ride runs at night.Price for adults in Jan 2016 was 13K won for seats in a regular car, and 20K for a ""crystal car"". Parking is free. Don't waste the money on the crystal car, we did. The gimmick is that the floor is see-through. But the acrylic plastic get so scratched by riders shoes that you cannot see through clearly. And anyway, who wants to look straight down at only water when the view is out the sides? Also, the ""crystal cars"" are only 1 out of 5, so you have to wait much longer than the cheap seats.Overall, the ride is a little short, but its worth the a 13K won (~$11) fare, and can you start from either end, get off at the other end, drink coffee, take pictures, etc.Kids will like it, except the ones afraid of heights.If you're a photo fiend, you'll love it."
Nice for couples,Choose your time wisely. Depending on who you are with depends on which type of car to take. The glass bottom cars are more popular so you have less of a chance to take it alone. The normal car has a better chance to get to ride with just you and your partner. It is a fairly short ride and if you do the round trip you need to get off at the other side and get back in line to ride back which is a bit strange.
Fantastic views all around!,"We splurged (the company who sponsored our trip did), and we got the crystal bottom cable car. So much fun! We could see the ocean below and the fabulous views all around. A must-do when in Yeosu!"
Short visit ,Very spacious cable car and long ride. It is fun and children as well as adults will enjoy.Price is reasonable.
