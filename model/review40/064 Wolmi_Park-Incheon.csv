Highlights,We really enjoyed the historic buildings and interactive games. I was fascinated to actually see how rice grows and had the opportunity to use the apparatus that transfers water Into the rice channels.Spring would be a great time to see all the azaleas in bloom. Great view
Well-managed park in Wolmi island.,"C ( 19.08.16 ) Though the beach was representative one in Wolmi island, this park was good to same with beach in Wolmi island, I think. The park was well-managed, and had Dulle-gil that was good road to trail. In the park, some facility for people was operating. I entered back door, so enjoy road, and museum. Good park in Wolmi island."
"beautiful area, rewarding hike","near the base, there are many picturesque areas and buildings. the gardens are very beautiful. should you decide to conquer the park, it will be quite the hike - so wear comfortable shoes and bring a bottle of water. the hike to the top can be rather arduous, whether you take the long slope road or the shorter but steeper stairs. once you reach the top, you'll be greeted by amazing breathtaking (literally) scenery. it is actually a place where couples commit their love or something, many signs showing affection on one another but they're in korean so i didn't understand then. nevertheless, it is really a journey!"
Creepy ,I think because I was alone. But was very beautiful and the same time terror scene. I left without see the temple the hv there.
Super park at the end of Incheon,"You can reach the park by walking from Chinatown entrance or take at the bus at the sane place.The park is large enough to have a nice stroll!You can walk along the mountain, enjoy the several gardens, temples, pavilions, and then start climbing to reach the top offering a super view over the sea and the coast!"
Lovely park and gardens,"The gardens are beautiful and great for a relaxing walk around. If you take some coins you can feed the coi carp and the deer. The park is free to walk around and you can easily walk up to the navy memorials and the continue round to the cultural street aka seaside town promenade. The amusement park looked like fun but it wasn't massive. It is definitely worth an afternoon of exploration.This again is on the Incheon City Tour bus route. It costs W5,000 per adult and allows you to jump on and off all day."
Hike in Wolmi Park-,"I took a taxi from Oakwood Premier Hotel to Wolmi Park. It was about $11 one way. I wanted to do something close to Songdo that was on the water. Wolmi Park offered lots of options for families with young children and for adults looking for some exercise. It probably offers much more than that, but I was only there for about 2 hours. The first thing I noticed was the rides. On the water front, there are lots of food options. You can wonder down into the water on some steps. I was there on a Monday in June, and it was quiet which I liked. I discovered some steps that take you up the mountain where I discovered pathways around the mountain. It's gorgeous and shady up there which was welcome in June on a humid day. I walked around the entire mountain and also took more steps up to the observatory. It was nice up there with great views of the area. There is a cafe in the observatory, but I didn't go there. It was quite a workout! I had no trouble catching a taxi back to the hotel. I made sure to take an address card. I could have stayed for dinner. I found a nice sushi place with a gorgeous water fall in an alleyway, but I opted to head back to the hotel."
A Day at Wolmido,"For me Wolmido Memorial Park and observatory was a personal trip. My grandpa was among the first Marines to land there over 50+ years ago during the Korean War. My whole trip to S. Korea was so I could walk in his steps. So for me the day was beyond worth it.However, if your touring Incheon this may not make your top 10 places to see. However, it is small enough to feel like you can experience the whole once island in one day. There is a mix of just about anything cultural, family fun, harbor shops, food and gardens to find something of interest here."
Cherry blossoms,"Visited in March, which was too early to get a good view of it, there seems to be a lot of green and flowers, but those were not in bloom yet. Will certainly visit again later on. Did get to see the first sakura blossoms, and we believe when all the cherry trees start to bloom there it must be a wonderful sight! Nice big village but we missed the activities since we passed there after 5pm but looked fantastic"
Great to check out if you are in Incheon,If you are mid transit in Incheon then this place is worth a visit as it gives a bit of an idea of Koreon cultural history. There are examples of 15th Century homes and the park is well layed out. We visited as part of the free transit tours and it was a pleasant suprise in a busy and built up city.
Beautiful park,"This is a nice place for people to rest, experience a glimpse of Korean culture and food, and learn something new from the Korean War."
Nice but hot,"Great place to visit if you are into history and nature. I went , however, in summer - and it was scorching hot. "
Korean Nature and Culture Park,"This park has several interesting areas of interest - Korean nature scenes, village life, beautiful flower gardens and more. A look into Korean life of years gone-by as can be seen from the typical building architecture of the time that are located in this park. Nice park to visit but may be boring to some."
Interesting park,"This park has depictions of life in rural villages. It's very interesting and it will give visitors an idea of what life was then. However, they had a man-made waterfall that they turned off without notice just as some of our friends were taking pictures."
Be with nature and learn history,"Be prepare to walk a lot as the park occupies a total area of 590,000 square metres. The park is composed of the well-preserved Wolmi mountain and the observatory platform that enables viewing of the coast of Incheon from the peak. One can enjoy the profound aroma of coffee, icy beer or icecreams while taking in the beautiful sceneries of Incheon at Cafe Wolmi Moonbeam Maru situated within the observatory. The next place to go is the 51,200 square metres Korean Traditional Garden where the garden styles of the Joseon Dynasty have been reproduced. Finally do not forget to visit the Cultural Center where you can experience traditional royal court and traditional korean dishes that are prepared using naturally cultivated ingredients, and the Korean Immigration Museum exhibiting the history of Korean immigrants. The park harmonizes nature, history and traditional culture."
The best park for family,There are not only many chance to enjoy Korean culture but also Korean famous gardens which is difference with Chaina and Japan
wolmi park,nothing much too see just few bonsai ..korean traditional culture dance costumes ...just to feel the greenary..n little culture of korea u can visit...
Nice experience,"I went here as part of the Free Airport Transit Tour. The area is good reconstruction of traditional Korean life. Good enough for pictures. Given the freezing cold, the relatively small size of the park is perfect."
Best Place in Incheon Harbour,"Having travelled to Wolmido and and was not very excited about the foreshore and the restaurants, the traditional park was a really nice surprise. It is a small oasis surrounded by industrial sites. Gentle walk to the summit, nice views all round from the top and had a decent coffee at the cafe in the observation tower. The traditional gardens were good with a few deer thrown in for good measure. Very beautiful as the leaves were all changing colour."
Excellent view from the top,"Rows of colourful flowers along the walkway. We took the tram up to the observatory tower and the view from the top was amazing. The Bridge, port and rest of incheon provided excellent views.Not to be missed."
Nice park,Good park to visit with kids.There is a observatory deck in the top of the hill which we can reach by rented electric car. 
Garden tour highlight,"Womido Park is expansive and it would be interesting to take the monorail first so you can choose which part of the park you wish too see, Make sure you do not go on a Monday as the Cultural Centre is closed. We really enjoyed the historic buildings and interactive games. I was fascinated to actually see how rice grows and had the opportunity to use the apparatus that transfers water I nto the rice channels. It is easier than it looks! Spring would be a great time to see all the azaleas in bloom!"
Good place to visit,"There are Korean traditional houses and Wolmi observatory where you can look around Incheon city.It's very exotic. And the observatory is the best place you can see the Incheon grand bridge and ports and sea.You can get more infomation on tourist info like attractions, restaurants and accomodations on my blog. http://fun-incheon.blogspot.kr/"
