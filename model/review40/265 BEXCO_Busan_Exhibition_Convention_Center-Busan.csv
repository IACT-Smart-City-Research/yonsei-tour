huge exhibition building,"we easily seated and parked 3,000 people in one of its hallshuge with a decent sound systembit older and some of the halls made me think of a more communist-era large & empty structures, purpose-built to hold zillions of people rather than for comfortbuilding 1 is the original bexco, while building 2 is the newer oneremember, those are not interlinked and you need to know which one you are going to to tell your taxi driver!"
Efficient and clean,This is a great conference and exhibition complex. Everything works and it is very easy to get around. I spent five days here and appreciated the amenities 
Excellent Conference Activities,Attended the AfDB Annual meetings. Great facilities as expected of an International Convention Centre. 
Meeting of the APGC,This is a large meeting area where conventions are held. Located with good access to the metro and public bus service.
"Spacious, good connectivity, excellent wifi","Attended a 3-day conference here. Easily accessible by various public transports, I tried both Metro & bus (can't remember which number but straight, single route from Huendae beach). Wifi's good. Huge conference hall."
Only if you have seen everything else Busan has to offer..,I would recommend Bexco only if you have seen everything else Busan has to offer. The site offers stunning views of the mountains/
Well-appointed spaces,Visited KorMarine 2017 last October and appreciated the well-marked areas for visitors. Make sure to catch an amazing view of the mountains as the backdrop of the exhibition hall.
time spent with korean friends,exhibition centre with many booths to visit.fast bus shuttle service from the hotels.good coffee shops.close to lunch venues and cinemas.
Excellent place for a big event,The event was over 2000 people and the organization was very good. The locals were very helpfull and the place clean. 
Reasonably big Exhibition and Convention Centre,"It is modern and has a nice architecture.Had the opportunity to visit BEXCO to attend Raillog 2017.It is a good place to attend exhibitions and conventions for professional in their relevant fields. Since 5-star hotels are walking distance from BEXCO therefore, one has access to a verity of excellent food."
Architecturally Impressive,This expo center of Busan South Korea is one of my fave places in Busan in terms of design. The area is also spacious.
Easy to access / with restaurants and shopping places near-by,"Easily accessible by subway for visitors from abroad attending events at the conventioncenter. There are some restaurants within the facilities, and also not far from restaurants, shopping mall, department stores and spa. Well kept and clean. "
Bexco,"Such a big place. Great location in Centum City, walking distance from the Shinsegae store. Lots of great exhibitions here. Stayed in an apartment right across from it and looks nice from the outside as well"
Boat show 2017!,Had a great time at the 2017 Boat Show! Showcased a lot of large boats and other watercraft. The expo center is huge and reminiscent of the Las Vegas Expo center. Lots of snack and beverage locations throughout.
Well organised,Place has few shops inside that you can grab a bite and also convenience stores. You will feel comfortable while waiting for a concert or show. Free wifi available 
Very nice centre for various activities,"Happened to be trying to find the Hanok experience here, but it was closed until Spring 2017. However I came across a fashion expo and there was lots of interesting exhibits including a hanbok design (traditional dress) exhibit. Had a very enjoyable time at BEXCO."
The most classic and spacious exhibition center of all times!,"Bexco exhibition center is located in Busan- South Korea. It is a modern technology classic that is well planned. Has spacious single business exhibition center, an entertainment arena, conference halls for big numbers and for special groups, a well equipped hospital within to handle emergency, spacious safe parking and within proximity to shopping premises all near. Security surveillance is modern and 24 hours. Ease in movements around."
Great Exhibition Place,"Went here for Busan International Shoe Show. The place was clean, modern, and huge. The location also quite near to the shopping center. Lovely place to visit."
Free hanbok experience,Very nice building and park. We really went here for the hanbok experience so we didn't really see any exhibits. The staff at the hanbok experience were really nice and informative.
Nice and Clean,"Great location for exhibitions, close to amenities and shopping. Nice touch with the convenience stores within its premises."
Hanbok experience at BEXCO,"The BEXCO is a huge centre and there is a hidden gem there. One can go there for a hanbok (S. Korean costume) experience, for both male and female. It takes a bit of time to find the little hanbok centre as it is not in an obvious place inside the BEXCO. Wearing hanbok clothing for photos is free of charge and there is display of some hanbok dresses. The attendant could speak foreign languages and was very patient in explaining the history."
EXCELLENT,A world class exhibition and convention center. Good facilities and easily accessible by public transport. 
Good Exhibition centre,"The BEXCO is a large and clean facility,almost all expos in Busan are held here.Toilets are neat and clean,good wifi,subway situated close by.The upmarket dapartment store is just a block away."
Space for so much more,"We were there for AdStars, an advertising industry award show. Whilst the place is huge and spacious, there didn't seem to be a lot of food options. Three quarters of the food court outlets where closed on both days we were there. But being surrounded by malls and shinsegea, the world's largest deparmental store, it's a short walk to solve that little hiccup. "
Great for conferences,"Been here for a conference. Huge venue with lots of restaurants and convenience shops. Also, with lots of exhibitions. "
Worth a wonder,"An interesting place for you to know more about festivals in Busan. You can witness them to organize those festivals and try with traditional costume called Hanbok. Every girl looks very nice in it and cute as well with two red spot on cheeks. Additionally, they also offer an exhibition of many brands of cars too."
Lots of exhibitions,"Bexco is always good they have a lot going on there have been waterpark,toboggon runs ,animal shows , tea and craft ,funfair ,beer festivals terracotta army exhibitions over the years and well worth a visit to see whats on as it changes often"
Great venue for a conference,Spacious and a lot of light inside and great air quality. That is at least what I am looking for in a conference venue. And BEXCO delivered.
Moto Show !,We were on way to experience Hanbok and BEXCO was just beside with an on going moto show. So we decided to experince how moto show in korea looks like. Well its a big hall which fit in many branded cars. It took us 2 hours to view. Not a bad spontaneous trip we had in busan.
Cavernous convention hall but good for conferencing!,I attended a small conference at BEXCO. The building are huge and in our case we had to walk quite a way to reach the place where our conference took place. The internet was iffy but not sure if this is related to BEXCO or the conference organisers. Many eateries within walking distance.
BCM2016,Attend BCM 2016 . Overall good experience and free wifi. Restaurant is good too. clean toilet and free water
Very nice facility - easily accessible by subway,We went to the BEXCO exhibition hall for an art show. The facility is pristine with lots of helpful staff. It is huge and can host many events at once without feeling crowded. There are various food outlets scattered throughout the facility as well as plenty of restrooms. We were able to get an upcoming events catalog in English at the information booth and intend to return for events that we are interested in.
BEXCO - 95th Annual Lions Clubs International Convention,"We participated the 95th Annual Lions Clubs International Convention from June 22 â€“ June 26, 2012 at BEXCO, Busan, Korea.It is very large place and functional for Exhibition and Convention purpose.Last 4 days, we were enjoyed many things to that place.Best regard,Ezaz Ul KarimDhaka, Bangladesh"
Busan -centum city,Very cool place where fun times spent with friends in identifying cultures of different countries and it was celebrations and festivals many entertainment and the region in which the place is very beautiful and lively area with shops and markets for shopping as there meter station near where
visit at Drone exhibition,Ticketing to slow .exhibition facilities average.No English indications at the booth.Very difficult finding English help .Exhibitors very seldom speaking English.Demonstrations poor.
Convention centre,"It is near shopping centre. The shopping centre is too large and many levels. If too tired, can go for spa land. Beautiful building."
Visited during exhibitions and for meals!,I have been to the BEXCO centre many times for both exhibitions or for family meals. There is a number of restuarants that cater to both the western and korea palate. It is a very good facility with close onsite parking.
Has a lot of children events ,"I have been to Bexco a number of times to attend children related events. It's spacious and the parking is convenient and abundant. People with a disability card get a discount off the parking fee. Inside there are convenient stores, cafes and plenty of toilets. "
HIdden gem,"The BEXCO complex is huge & architecturally beautiful. It is so big you may get lost in it! Which I did. When I visited, it was largely empty with very few people inside (it felt like a giant space ship). However, I was there to have some fun at the ""Hanbok Experience"" which was located in a little corner. It has a small display of traditional hanbok & a lovely guide to tell you about the wearing of the hanbok. The fun part is that you get to try on a hanbok & have your photo taken. Definitely a must visit if you happen to be in the area. The Centum City Shinsigae dept store is also nearby if you must have some shopping in your itinerary!"
Bus an convention centre,"Bexco refers to busan exhibition and convention centre built specially to cater Asian games activities. It is situated in centrum an upend business district surrounded by sprawling skyscrapers all around and shopping malls and departmental stores.BEXCO house a well equipped auditorium, exhibition hall, art gallery, conference hall and meeting room. The entire complex is a marvel piece of design and architecture."
It's a convention center,"I'm not sure how impressed one can be by a convention center. Anyone who's ever been to any convention center in a major city, this one is about the same. I'm not sure why it's listed as one of the top things to do in Busan, because it's just a building that houses different exhibitions at different times of the year. For example, when I was there, it was a Fisheries convention and a bridal expo going on. However, directly behind this building (and across a street) is the Busan Museum of Art, which was was an interesting stop to take in some culture. "
good place for a conference,I was there for a conference. the rooms were very comfortable. wifi signal was so-so. great central location. 
Don't see how this is a destination,"I was there because I had a conference to attend. Otherwise, I cannot see why anyone would go--just a massive convention center around a massive slab of concrete. As a convention center, it was fine. As a tourist destination, I would hope you have better things to do and see."
Well maintained BEXCO,The BEXCO is located very close to Haehundae beach and the place is well connected from KTX and airport by bus and subway.Overall very good convention center.
"BEXCO, convention and more! ","BEXCO is a convention center like no other place I visited. It is situated in the heart of Heaundae-gu. It is very accessible by bus, taxi or subway since the area is well planned. Establishments like hotels, shopping area and restaurants abound the area. BEXCO grounds is huge! There are open spaces, you don't feel crowded. And many photo opportunities for selfie enthusiast! Aside from hotels and restaurant, The Busan Museum of Art is beside BEXCO, which have selected art exhibits. Entrance is general free with selected exhibits with minimal charge. The grounds also have quirky exhibits. "
Excellent location for large meetings,I had the pleasure of attending the 48 th IUPAC world congress in Busan which was held in BEXCO. The location is great and there are restaurants on the ground floor which makes it convenient during lunch hours. There are alos several malls nearby.
BEXCO Event,"Very well organized, but hot due to glass roof. The meeting rooms were cool to cold. TH\he facilitates were excellent and the food court in the lower level was ideal for quick service between meetings"
Best Venue for large meetings,"The Busan Exhibition centre is really nice for large meetings,conferences etc.It comes with offices and all other add ons that you can think of when it comes to holding conferences It is easily accessible and it is well known.Large parking spaces also available.There are lots of hotels near by so the visitors dont have any difficulty in finding near by accommodation of their choice."
HUGE convention center,"It's a HUGE Convention Center, by far this is the largest I ever been to. Smack directly next to Shinsegae, the world largest department store. The convention center is clean and tidy. Wifi is off and on depends where you're at. There's only 2 Cafe B (one at each end) but there's restaurant and hotels right opposite the convention center, you just need to walk across the main road. To grab a cab, it's advisable to grab one at the hotel lobby, cabs are hardly drove into the convention center area."
"Nothing much to see that day, but impressive nonetheless","A few events going on that weren't of interest to us. We walked around the auditorium and exhibition halls I&II. There's a food court in the basement, as well as coffee shops and convenience stores on 1F."
Huge,"The exhibition center was so huge, so we didn't have enough time to see around completely. The place was so interesting and gave us much information and knowledge about Korean culture and lifestyle. Location was reachable easily, either by subway or by bus."
Quite a gigantic modern design,It is just right situated at the station of 'Museum of Art' and next to the shopping mall Centum City. Location-wise!
Go there for the Hanbok Experience!,"We had a lovely time there at the Hanbok Centre playing with the machines and taking virtual photos. Thereafter, go for the real thing and put on the gorgeous costumes and take beautiful pictures. Our visit was great as no other guests were there. We had a great time posing and laughing at ourselves. Good place to spend and hour or two."
It depends on what is showing,"Yes, the building is impressive and it is right at a subway stop. However what really makes this place is whatever exhibits or shows are there."
for business,"Makes for a good convention and business centre. it is the place for good meetings, conferences and large scale exhibitions."
Massive place,We went there for a free Hangbuk (korean traditional costume) photo session & another where u can choose your costume virtually & have your picture taken & send to your email address. There's costumes on display for royalties & peasants. Its situated on the right hand corner of the BEXCO building as you walked towards the building. The staff in charge will assist & dress you up in the korean traditional costume.There's free wi fi
busan best exhibition mall,"busan made new city near haeundae beach. beautiful skyline high buildings town, BEXCO, world best department store Shinsegei. BEXCO is located in center of this city. a lot of exhibitions r opened here. "
Big Convention Center,"One of the biggest convention center I have ever visited. Everything was managed well. Clean, well organized. Although I hope there were some Korean touch. It was easy to come here, direct by MRT."
Good facilities,"Clean, kept up well. Fine facility. Conveniently located. Modern.Nice city to have convention.Nothing bad to say"
Great convention centre,"Lived in Busan for three years and attended two events in BEXCO. The Busan International Motor Show was the first, and I was thoroughly pleased with the event and with BEXCO itself. BEXCO has an impressive and aesthetically pleasing design, with more than enough room to host the motor show's various showrooms and events of the various manufacturers, as well as a cool layout in front of the building the sound system companies to set up and promote their systems.Definately recommend going if your in the area for one of their premier exhibitions or shows."
Well organized,This is a clean and well organized exhibition center. One could wish for better Wifi and more food in the main hall.
We are exhibiting here,"Exhibition hall is spacious with many eateries. We have participated in the exhibition and we have got good potential customers during this exhibition,"
Large convention center with plenty of rooms,Had meetings here for 3 weeks. Place had an easy layout to follow. Plenty of clean bathrooms and other facilities. Restaurants are in the lower level and are pretty decent.
Beautiful Expo Center,Beautiful state-of-the-art expo center in Busan. Meeting rooms are nice and there are cafes in which to get your fix.
Great Location & Good Exhibition Center,"Location is great, Very close to Metro Station ( Centum City ) & near to shopping mall ( Sinsegae ), The Exhibition center Is Big, clean, Had some business meeting there, a lot of staff speaks English."
Excellent convention center,"This is a exhibition and convention center and not a place you would visit as a tourist unless you are attending a convention/exhibition. This is a huge center and the convention i was attending barely occupied a quarter of the center. The facilities were excellent, high speed wi-fi, professional organization, no hiccups in IT facilities and everything was clean. There are many places for food nearby. It is also connected to the subway, so it is not necessary to book a hotel nearby. All in all good experience."
very large space convention center,"very well located pint he city center, convenient access, near to the largest department store, best place for exhibitions and conventions. "
Convention center extra ordinaire,Strategically situated just below or at the tip of gwangan bridge. We were so lucky enough to have visited the place while they were having an auto show where hundreds of top of the line automobiles are being showcased comfortably in this huge convention center. there's also a subway line just beneath it for ease and comfort of travelers and tourists alike.
Beautiful Building,It was a huge Center but lots of walking. There was a car show so it held very little interest but even the surrounding buildings were awesome and lots of really good shopping. 
Just walkby,"it located opposite of the Museum of Art. When I been there, nothing much to see. but It is grand and sure happening when it does have events."
Well equipped and well laid out,"Compared to the exhibition grounds at Hanover, the BEXCO has halls in a multi story arrangement, which makes life easier for the exhibitors and visitors.I attended the Kormarine exhibition and the Naval & Defence exhibition held concurrently at the BEXCO. The sheer size had me on my feet for 3 hours at at stretch. However, I would stop now and then for a Tea at a conveniently located Coffee shop.To make life easier there were moving walkways between the two large areas of the BEXCO. The conference I attended also had a lot of Uni kids recruited to help visitors. These kids knew English and did a good job guiding people like me, who needed help.The subway and taxi ranks are very close. All in all a well thought out Exhibition center."
It's Big!,enormous convention centre. I attended the asian Film Market there and it was set up very well but was just in a fraction of the complex. The architecture is breathtaking.
Modern convention center,"Easily one of the better convention centers I've been to. Huge and with easy access to the subway, Shinsegae Centum City and the Busan Museum of Art. The facility is large enough to hold 3 to 4 conventions at the same time. There are coffee shops in the ground floor, and restuarants in the basement if you want quick bites in between sessions. However, if you have time, you can get better choices at Shinsegae Centum City across the street."
depends on the conference I guess,"conference I attended provided no 'rest' areas or 'chairs', you know for say when you want to miss a session and do some work instead....but there are lots of cafes nearbyits near haeundae - taxi ride about 3000 won"
Great convention center,"I have visited many convention centers in various locations, however, this is one of the top convention center that I can recommend. I just visited because of the event press. there are restaurants located on basement level, Starbucks, and convenience store. Great place for the conference and exhibitions. Also, there are couple of department store located across from this place, where you can visit easily. Furthermore, the transportation system is really good! you can just take subway and get off right under the center"
Shopper's Paradise,too many selections to choose from. Must spend the whole day here. look for great buys from apparels like H&M to cosmetics and bags.
"Modern, well designed conference center","A nice, well equipped conference center directly adjacent to the gigantic Centum City shopping mall. "
Worth a wonder,"Bexco has events running all through the year and there are diverse amounts to choose from. Even if you have a free weekday or weekend free, it's worth a visit to see what's on offer. It's only a short walk from the Centum Subway and not all events have admission fees."
Great venue for the Auto Show,I visited here for the Korean Auto Show 2012 and was quite impressed with the layout and the architecture. I visited another time for a sporting event and it was just as awesome.
Looks cool,I walked inside and looked cool but I did not get a chance to explore as there was a Mom and Baby's convention going on. 
Huge and nice place.,"I attended in a conference at that place. It was nice and close to subway. Shinsage (shopping area or mall) was really close, nice neighbourhood."
confusing at first,I've been here a few times for a few different exhibitions and I'm still a bit confused when I walk in trying to find what I'm looking for--if you dont know the logo or dont see it on a sign from far away it will take you awhile to find the hall its in.
big exhibition center,"I went for BIFCOM and the art exhibition there. It's really nice. Starbucks, mcdonalds and other nice korean restaurants are there too. "
huge,"lots of walking but signs everywhere with people to direct you to proper locations, great restaurants and even a wedding chapel below"
International Lions convention,Since there were 55 thousand Lions in attendance we felt we were treated very well. The Korean people are extremely polite and helpful.
Brand New Facility,Not too much to complain about the place is huge! There is a moving walkway between the two complexes. The conference rooms are standard. They also have smaller private rooms and VIP rooms. Paint and floors are brand new. Everyone there is aiming to please. Bathrooms are clean- although you can lok right into the men's room and watch the guys at the urinals! Hopefully they realize this and put up a privacy wall.
Everything you Need,"Our Lions International Convention was held here. Everything was all in one spot. We didn't have to travel to watch the special shows, the exhibition hall was there and it had a huge conference room. Very Convenient! There are some restaurants on the bottom level. The French restaurant was reasonable and the food was good, however, it did not serve French food."
"One of the best Convention centers I have visited till now. Spread over about 14 acres, it has all the facilities.",Excellent. Distance between one side and the other at times feels to be too long
Busan Convention Center,Bexco is a large convention center with lots of different size meeting rooms. The hallways are not air conditioned. Getting to and from the three buildings is easy on the second floor walkways. Attending a convention you will do a lot of walking.
With a purpose,BEXCO is very very large. I would recommend to go to it only if you know something is going to be there. Otherwise you are looking at a really large building.
Bexco on 2 locations,"Bexco is a very nice and big building, where you can go and visit events. For example: fashion show or just a place where kids can play. Sometimes they will have interesting things like tea exhibition, believe me, it's really fun to go. They are almost finished with the second Bexco building, that is connected to the first location. It's really nice to see. The building is huge and looks great. I have to visit it when they are finished building it. It's just located on the oposite side of the first location, you can't miss."
Typical convention centre,"BEXCO is typical convention centre. Not the best though, slightly outdated. Good that they have food stores in the basement and you can have difficult types of food. Tried one of the local noodle store and is very reasonable (both quality and price.All in all, may not worth visiting unless you are going on for a conference"
Excellent Convention Center,"Central location with the world's largest department store, Shinsegae within 5 minutes from the convention. "
nice area,"shopping complexes, eating joints, some fun rides for kids. overall, a more than average experience "
convention hall like a bare hangar,"We were there for the APAO 2012. The hall is barren, no carpets in the halls, bare concrete. Dismal food service. Poor experience"
It's a Convention/Expo Center ;-),"Went here with some friends in hopes of seeing one of the attractions, but it was too expensive. Building was easy to find though and located near other attractions (Such as the Busan Internation Film Festival theater)No fee to get in the building, but there was (obviously) a fee to participate in certain attractions."
