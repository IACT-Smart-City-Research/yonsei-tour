Private place and only opens to public during October,A small and private place. They say that this is a private place own by a rich man who created this for the enjoyment of his ill wife. The ginkgo trees are planted bh him and only open in October. We were not lucky when we went there because the leaves of the ginkgo trees alhave already fallen due to rains the previous days. It was compensated by the colors of the trees/leaves at the entrance though.
Beautiful ginkgo forest,"Hongcheon ginkgo forest is a hidden gem because it is not open to the public except in the first 3 weeks of Oct. (approx. period) when the ginkgo trees turn into a beautiful yellow colour. The map coordinates are: 37°41'49.0""N 127°53'19.3""E and one has to join a local tour (in Seoul) to go there, as it is quite remote (3-4 hours drive from Seoul city). I went there in early Oct. and only the rear part of the forest has turned yellow. Nevertheless it was a great place to visit. The ginkgo forest which had been strictly closed to the public for 25 years starting in 1985, has been allowing free admission during a designated 20-day period in October. Located at the far eastern end of Hongcheon County, the ginkgo forest is lined with around 2,000 ginkgo trees planted at intervals of 5 metres. In Oct., the ginkgo leaves turn yellow and create an unforgettable scene. Near the ginkgo tree forest, visitors can try local specialties sold by local residents.The best time to visit the ginkgo forest is mid Oct. This forest is probably the best place to see ginkgo trees in S. Korea."
