"Relaxing & unique hike, but would take the taxi next time","Took 2 buses from the Yuseong area and then had to wait about 45 minutes at the bus stop for the 74 up the mountain. Had I known that, would have just taken a taxi (for less than 20k Won). Not sure if that is the actual scheduled time or if there wa sa hiccup and some 74s just didn't come... It took us about 2 hrs to get up, and I was already pretty over it. But I am glad we stuck with it - it was worth the difficult ride up. Siunce it was already 2pm when we got there, we just hiked up (with shoes) to the fortress, and came back down barefoot. It was a total of 7k and took almost 2.5 hours with a leisurely picnic at the top. This was the perfect length for us on this day. The fortress has amazing views of the mountain and river and city. I would definitely suggest walking with shoes in the beginning and barefoot on the way back. There are lots of bathrooms and drinking water faucets and spots to wash your feet and shoes. It's free, since a private investor pays for the upkeep. The hike was more strenuous than I expected, but mostly because of the many many steps up to the fortress. But do-able for all ages and levels of fitness."
15km of undulating woodland walk with an interesting fort,"We caught two buses from Daejeon to get here, which was straightforward. The walk itself starts off with beautiful soft squishy mud and you could easily wear bare feet the whole way around, but we detoured up to the 7th Century fort that is in the middle of the loop, so put our shoes back on. With this detour and a generous stop for lunch (and to share food and sochu with locals on the top!) it was a 4-5 hour stroll. There's plentiful toilets and water, and a place to wash and dry your feet at the start/end. There's also food vendors for snacks. "
Go to the Barefoot Festival!,"A group of 7 of us traveled at least an hour to climb half this mountain, during the fesitval. We went on the day that the marathon was not taking place, so it was not crowded. We were able to leisurely walk, take photos and enjoy the clay and its healing properties. The clay gets sprayed with water periodically to keep it moist and comfortable to walk on. We did not walk on the clay with shoes at all, so we brougt backpacks to hold our shoes, water and snacks. There are vendors selling beverages and snacks, there might have been one restaurant at the start of the clay path. There were a few areas for families: for children to play and do arts and crafts. There is a bathrooms, rinsing station and a few benches to sit and rest along the path. There is also an outdoor theatre where singers, dancers and musicians perform during the festival. There are places to clean your feet at the entrance and exit (same place) of the path. My only complaint is that was we all got lost and it ended up taking a lot longer to arrive. For the festival at least, I wish there was an easier way to get to the mountain. It was a great and rare experience."
Interesting hike,An enjoyable hike. The cooling sensation from the red mud and it's so therapeutic can go on forever. Worth a visit if you happen to be in Daejeon. Definitely one of my favourite place to visit in Daejeon and will definately come back for a hike.
Fun and different,"Go to this trail when it's warm so you can truly enjoy the red clay, if at least for a short jaunt. The trail was marked clearly and even the bus ride out was a lovely adventure, being hidden in a valley. Bring some cash to buy fruit from the vendors. Be prepared to get dirty. The entire trail holds lovely different surprises like a train playground for children, various washing stations, the usual outdoor workout equipment, benches, picnic areas, scenic viewing areas and so on. Pleasant and definitely worth the trip."
