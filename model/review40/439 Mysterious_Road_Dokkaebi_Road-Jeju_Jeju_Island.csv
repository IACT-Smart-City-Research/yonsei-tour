Holiday,Heard about this road from our tour guide. We experience it in a bus. The driver stop the bus n turn of the engine...the bus will drive itself. Pretty cool experience 
Really Mysterious,Experience the car to move backward even though you are not reversing the car. My kids and I enjoyed the experience.Worth it.
Interesting place to visit,It is an interesting place to visit. There are some fruit stalls nearby and selling nice oranges and grapes. 
Not So Exciting,"The attraction is not so exciting but still worth a visit if it is your first time in Jeju. This attraction is also pretty near Jeju's Loveland, an interesting and popular attraction that is not mentioned in TripAdvisor. "
Doubtful attraction,Not the only place in the World to claim fame to a road that looks uphill while running downhill. Didn’t get any excitement from this “wonder” of the World.
Just another magnetic hill,"A magnetic hill. Interesting if you’ve never seen one before. Otherwise, just another hill where your car appears to roll uphill. "
Not amazing,Went to this as part of a tour. The view from the coach as your “defying gravity” is of a coach full of people craning their necks not straight ahead which you need to get the perspective. This is something thats maybe worth doing on the way to somewhere else but don’t go out of your way for it.
Great fun,We drove past it on another parallel road and didnt realise how fun it was! So we made it a point to visit it and try it out before we returned the rental car. The speed went up to almost 20km/h! We didnt encounter any local motorists though there were some tourists placing water bottles to see them roll up the hill :)
Not a wow ...,"I wouldn't say this is a must visit attraction. Our driver took some time to show us this place since we were passing thru. The kids found it somewhat interesting, we spent about 10 mins trying out the optical illusion in the car."
It’s all in your mind... no mystery here,"I tried walking and rolling in car to feel the effects of such claims... no luck, felt cheated... at least the kids had fun."
Just so so,"It this is on the way to your other destination, then no harm dropping by. We just drove past by the road, then came down to take some picture. A 10 min pit stop. Nothing fanciful. Not a big deal to give this a miss. "
Up ??? Down ...,IncredibleSeems to go uphill ... but in fact go downhill.Pure optical illusion.To be seen once. Car at neutral point.. and see what is happening.
Nice to drive along though.,We passed by this road. Our guide explain about this mysterious road. We did not get down anymore but nice to dropby if your sked will allow. 
Dokkaebi Road,Have fun seeing the car rolled up the slope while in neutral gear. There are lots of people there videotaping the effect.
Optical illusion,We visited this stretch of the road and experienced the slope of the road. The driver stopped the engine and switched to neutral. To our big surprise the bus picked up speed and rolled downhill. 
Watch cans and cars move uphill unaided.,I was there watching a child put a can on the road at the entrance to the car park and the can rolled uphill.I then put my car in the same place in neutral and filmed it rolling UPHILL.I can only assume that the road appears to be uphill but must be sloping down.Unless there is some other scientific answer.It is worth the effort to see it for yourself.Bottles did not work like an empty can.There is an Archery range there so you can practice some archery as well.
Let it go! WOW!,"We heard and saw this on TV and view to visit when we get the chance so of course we had to see for ourselves. We had impression very crowded road but there were only a few cars. It was about 4pm. We were able to follow another car uphill turn around, follow to the start point.We put car on neutral then let it drive us. Very strange. It just move slow motion like haunted road feel.We stop by at a mart for coffee. There is a cafe too. A few people cos winter not nany tourists strangely, we saw a van and a bus doing same thing, just gliding down.It was just nice finally seeing and experiencing this in jeju."
Can't feel anything,Not sure if there is a certain period of time to get this feel. Tried a few times but nothing seems to be as it mentioned. 
Mysterious Phenomenon ,It’s does appears that the law of gravity is defied! Haha. Big ample car park available at site if u drive. Nice lady at the stalls along the road facilitated my science experiment by lending me a water bottle to roll on the road. And yes! It does appears that the water bottle was rolling uphill against the law of physics. Its worth a visit if u are in town! 
"Indeed, it is mystery","We went here to get the experience for the gravity feels, and its totally worth it. Our car moves on its own without using any human forces. One of the interesting place for tourists spot and attraction. "
Mysteriously hard to judge,"We did this as part of Yeha bus tour - South Course - we were in the back of the bus, so it was really hard for us to see, but apparently, you put your vehicle in neutral and it rolls the opposite of what you would expect. I'm sure the experience would be better in a car."
Not mystery but science,"If you have kids, bring them along to let them understand how science can explain mystery and how eye perception cannot be 100% accurate. "
The road is interesting ,This is a interesting road drive whereby even the engine is off the car will even go upslope. It is worth to go there for an experience. 
I dont see anything here,I cant tell any mystery about this road. Maybe becoz i dont drive there..so i cant tell..this place is just walking distance from Loveland..
Kids will like it,I did have fun doing the experiment inside the car as I switched off my car engine. Some kids tried to use water bottles to do the experiment but I don’t think it worked too well. 
Fascinating Phenomenon ,"There is a start point specified on the road. I stopped my car, put car to neutral and released the brakes - the car started to move slowly forward and up slope! From inside the car, the road is up slope, yet the car is like rolling down slope on neutral gear. Fascinating! A must try if you are self-driving. "
Definitely mysterious ,"This road defy the law of gravity. When a car is on neutral gear and foot off the accelerator, cars can actually go “uphill” on this road!"
Interestingly “nice”,It’s mysterious enough to wonder who started to make this as one of a tourist attraction. Apart from being mysterious there is nothing much to see. 
Mysterious Road (Dokkaebi Road),"The drive there was pleasant as you passed through many scenic places. Saw some homes with unique design.As we were at the start of Mysterious Road, our taxi driver switch off the engine and let the car just roll “up the road”. Was wondering how could this happen!!! We witness some other vehicles doing the same. Our taxi driver took a bottle of waterAnd pour it in the middle of the road, the water didn’t flow backward. A group of Chinese tourist ,were doing the same thing, the guide say it’s a scam. But the truth is “Optic Illusion “Nice backdrop of mount hallasan "
Just a road. No experience to be gained.,"Though the name makes it very mysterious and people become very curious, it doesnt really add to any experience. Not worth the hype it creates. "
Not very excited ,I did not enjoyed this road. There is nothing espectacular about it. They turn off the engine and place the bus on neutral and the bus moves going down an up a little hill...
Overated attraction,"Many tours include this spot for tourists. I personally find it over-rated. It is an illusionary experience where the environs surrounding the particular stretch of road gives one the impression that it is not what it is supposed to be. Some guides would even spill water on the road to experiment. Interesting - yes, but I would not include it as part of a tour itinerary. "
Hit or Miss,We went there and did see something but it’s probably a hit or miss place unless you have time.There’s a nice cafe with a huge garden there though.
Enroute,"We visited Mysterious Road on our return journey from Hallasan. We tried rolling water bottles, but failed lol. Eventually we did the touristy thing of shutting the car engine and letting the car ""roll up the slope"". Interesting."
Almost missed it ,"We missed this and had to make a detour to find this signage cos there were tour buses blocking it by the road. There were alot of tourist and students when we arrived. The myth is true, it does roll upwards! "
Mysterious road trip ,did a slight detour this place before returing to airport. the road was pretty empty except for one or 2 cars that were already. Did a u turn to face up the slope from where we got in. Followed the sign where to start and put it to Neutral and experience the pull up the slope. It was over with about 200-300m stretch and turned into the carpark beside the shop. Didn't really feel anything strange or excited about it. 
Only if you have spare time,"At eye level, the short stretch looked like an upward sloping road, but it was actually a 3 degrees downhill slant. A bit out of the way, would not recommend making a trip there unless you're from Jeju-si enroute to Hallasan National Park. Many of the 'mysterious bottle rolling uphill' videos have been posted on youtube in case you want to see the mystery! The real attraction here was the huge iconic black pig family statue. It was detailed and incredible. LOL"
Funny if you are with friends :),"We went there with a local guy who show us the mystery. We were in a group of friends and found it quite funny that our car rolled downhill why it looked impossible. I think it can be boring when go along. It's just a short stretch of road, nothing spectacular, just for fun. Visit if you are in the area, but I would not make a trip just to go for this specific attraction."
illusions!,Illusions make you see the road going upwards but in fact gravity shows it is going downwards. Interesting.
Believe it or not,We tried putting our water bottle down to see if the bottle roll up downhill.. errmmmm... Yeahhh.. not disappointed anyway
Optical Illusion,Good to visit this place for an understanding of why it's happening. Optical illusion of the Dokkaebi road and the story behind its discovery. Short road distance about 150m from start to the ending point. 
Interesting road,Using bare eyes to look at the roads it appears to go up while actually its going downhill. If you put a water bottle on the road it will slide down. Interesting.
Fun to visit if in the area. ,This place is just outside the love land . There is a huge parking lot just behind this row of shops. In front of these shops selling sausages and fruits is the road . You can borrow a bottle of water and row it down the road and miraculously it will come to a stop and row backwards! Opposite the road is a grazing field where you can see cows . Ok a visit if you are in the area. 
Fascinating for young kid,"My 4 year old found the road very fascinating and he kept mentioning mysterious road throughout the day. It was probably just an average experience for adults but if you are travelling with the little ones, it may be worthwhile to spend some time to bring your kids to view this road."
Rolling upward the hill...,Interesting place. Just a eye trick because of surroundings. Not worth if you go there intentionally 
Beautiful stretch,"Mysterious Road (Dokkaebi Road) is a beautiful stretch of road, and is right in the middle of the forest."
Small but interesting,"It was interesting but not too mysterious. It's just a trick of the eye because of the surroundings. Anyway, it was a fun little detour and makes for good videos/pictures to show my students back in the States."
"Not worth the detour, but if close by, why not?","We went here as a detour and sure it is a tiny bit interesting... but would not recomend any detour here, many fabolous places on the island to spend time on instead."
"If you pass the street, take a look. If not, no need","Its just something like a less than 50 meter road with ""strange"" situation. Not worthed if you intentionally go there. "
Fun time defying the odds,We heard about this and immediately thought that we should come by to see it for ourselves. Initially we took a bottle thinking to place it on the road as we were too shy to drive in our car. But the bottle was too light and the wind actually was moving it instead. We saw ppl just came and did what was suggested. Just put the car to neutral and do not step on the accelerator - the car will move forward despite it’s an uphill road. We did that twice as there’s not much car around. :-)
Our car can really move uphill!,Very interseting to see our car moves uphill with the engine off. My tour guide explained the reason behind this but I still don't understand XD. Try to pour the water and the same thing happened.
Where the car rolls uphill,"Very interesting road on the way from Jeju City to Hallasan. Haven’t quite figure out why at a certain stretch the car actually rolls upwards on a neutral gear and without brakes. Probably an optical illusion but I didn’t stay to figure out - better just take it as a mysterious road, it’s more interesting. There’s some statues of pigs nearby, symbolizing prosperity and many children. Take a picture, touch the pig’s head. "
"Interesting visit, switch off the car engine to experience ""rolling upward""","There was a tour group with a guide when we visited. We saw his demonstration of water flowing upstream and a water bottle that roll upstream too. very interesting, when you switch off the car engine and witness the car rolling upwards."
Just nice to visit,"We just pass by this place to try and observe this mysterious road. Well , it is kinda so. We did not get off of our coaster anymore since our driver show it already to us."
Mysterious Drive,Nice experience. You will require to stop the car and change the gear to N and you will feel the car start moving slowly even though is sloop.
Meh,"Underwhelming. We needed a stop and there were some interesting shops nearby (persimmons and mushrooms, I think) so it wasn't a total loss, but not worth the detour. "
Really fooled me,"This mistery road is about half kilometer long. Stop you’re vehicle at the start of this road, put the gear in neutral, and turn off the engine. Your car slowly climbs up a pretty steep slope. At least what it looks like upward slope. It is really hard to believe that the upward slope is an optical illusion and it in reality slopes down. I have seen magnetic hill in Moncton, Canada and they have a road like this. But there is just below a mountain slope and the optical illusion is very understandable there but here there is no such thing, just a plain stretch of road. I really could not figure out how your eyes are deceiving your brain. Not a big deal,but worth experiencing it if you are in Jeju."
just a road,just a road where if you stand and poured water or dropped a coin usually they just stay in place but on this road it moves as if the road is not straight
Very misterious,To arrive in jeju misterious road you can go by bus or private car. If you use private car you can try how misterious that road. If you go by bus you need to walk to arrive in jeju misterious road. 
Quite....interesting?,"There is a start sign & stop sign. Upon reaching the start sign, switch to neutral gear, on hazard light, and keep your car engine on. It will start to move forward on a uphill slope. Very slowly. Of course, do be alert and keep your eye infront and foot hover on brake if necessary.It is a one lane traffic, so not all cars are stopping to be wow by this nature forces, you might be honked by other drivers for slowing down and doing this anti-gravity act. Well... just ignore them. They will move on by cutting your lane.There is a convenient shop next to it and car park. You can park your car there and come down to try it with a half-filled water bottle. It will perform the same too, rolling up on a up-slope.However, beware of cars. There is still on-coming traffic."
What is the point?,Unless you are passing in a car it seems pointless to search out this road. Even then I did not see many cars staying more than a couple of minutes and most people seemed bemused
Strange but true,Our taxi driver took us here after going to Horseland (by the way there are better horse places). The driver switched the ignition off placed it in neutral and it rolled up hill rather than down. A very odd experience. If you are passing by it is definitely worth the experience.
For the fun of it,"Just go and remember to turn on hazard lights, and neutral gear. If you are in the wrong direction you may just roll backwards “uphill”. Lol.Do beware of impatient locals speeding hy..."
Good experience,We manage to visit this Mysterious Road while on our way going to Hallasan but we are unable to try the road on our own. The road is really mysterious but the length of the road is not that long. We just try the road by using a mineral bootleg water and it is really awesome. You can try Visit it if you are curious about the road.
Never come!,waste time because the mysterious road is less than 100 meters only. it is also dangerous because all locals will try to cut off your vehicle at a speed.
Mysterious Road in Jeju,My wife and I visited this road last year during our 4 days tour of Jeju. It was a good experience but once is enough. Jeju is a really wonderful island to visit and we will definitely come back in the future
There’s something mysterious about the Mysterious road ,"If you’re driving around Jeju Island, this place is a must. It took me a while to figure out what was the big deal (mysterious) about this road but after I figured out the way it was described to be, it was definitely cool and somewhat mysterious. So here it goes: you drive upto the starting point of mysterious road and put the car in neutral gear. The road certainly looks like and uphill, however the car drives forward until 100m to the end of the mysterious road. Anti-gravity huh? I’m not sure of the scientific explanation for this phenomenon, but I recommend you experience this if you’re driving around Jeju Island. Takes only 15 minutes and certainly worth the time and experience! "
Start from the sign ,"We drove here using waze , got to start from the signage point beside the road , try to put the gear to neutral and it does move. It's a short drive like 1 -2 minute here . Then we park our car near the 7 eleven and use the restroom . "
It's strange but fun,"Quite confuse why my tour leader brought us here until he did some experiment about this road. So it's a downward-hill that looks like an incline. Couldn't understand how it can be happen, but my bottle keeps moving upward"
nothing special,"it's only an eye perspective view. when we see the car slowly run up while the machine off, the road actually go down. Nothing special"
Nothing to shout about,"Ok it’s a road that looks like up hill but your car can move forward. In my opinion you can skip this unless you are on the way. While we were on this road, one car started honing us for being slow. He later turn in to love museum rushingly!!"
Magic road,Fascinating 100m. Our car rolled down when on Neutral and the road is flat... Bottle of water rolling backward. Same goes when water was poured on the ground...
Not so mysterious,"We may be doing it wrong but when we tried to put water on the road nothing really happens. but we were amused by the cows on the other side of the road (a farm, i think?) and big statue of pigs.. :D"
Family vacation ,We visited these stretch of the road and experienced the slope of the road. A good family vacation. Thanks. 
Big surprise,"When you reach the place you bet your life that the road goes uphill. The driver stopped the engine and switched to neutral. To our big surprise the car picked up speed and rolled downhill. your eyes were cheated by the bushes, trees and surroundings."
Not So Mystical,"Went there. Nothing about this road is mysterious or mystical. It is simply based on illution. Well, for anyone who curious about it can try to pass on that road. No need to spend so much time there."
Its extremely bizarre!!!,"my tour guide brought us to take a look at this ""mysterious road"", my coach driver just switch to neutral gear then the coach start to move by itself and in constant speed, the road seems flat and straight but its not and its just within a mere 100m distance, my guide told us that scientific proven is becoz of wind. An interesting place not to be miss. Try it out yourself to feel the excitement."
Didn’t find anything mysterious ,It’s a small road with sign START & END stating the start & the end of mysterious road. But to be frank....we didn’t find anything mysterious. 
You have to be there to believe it is real.,"Turn off your engine, it will push your car uphill.The speed was fast, it is not magic, it is a real thing.You have to see it in person to believe it. If you go there after sun set, it will give you a chill.Must see place on Jeju island. I believe if you a tour, you will get a chance to experience it."
Didnt work,"Tried with car, stroller, water bottle in the rainNothing workedDrive all the way to this road in the rain for nothingStarted trying it at the ""start here"" sign"
Interesting experience ,"It was very weired and interesting. If you are going there, try to turn off your car and test it if the road tricks you! You will be very surprised! "
Amazing!!! mysterious road,"This road is truly amazing, its 100 meters mysterious street , people really stopped and test how the mystery going."
Amazing road,"You really need to put a coin or can on the road to see the illusional effect. You think you are going downhill, but it is in fact the opposite."
Not As Expected,Read about it and found it really interesting and we decided to go take a look but pretty disappointed as we all tried but it was not working. One good thing was that it's not a wasted trip as it is very near to Jeju Love Land/ Park. 
Good for a passby,"Good experience, but not so special as there are some other place in my home country that seems similar to it. We are on a group tour, upon reaching the road our driver stopped the engine, the bus continued running, the tourguide did some explanation, something about magnetic features of the area, if you will look around its just like an ordinary road."
Not much time needed to experience this place,"If you have some time to spare, it is recommended to check out this place. However if you are in a really short trip, IMO i dont think its worth to drive here as its just a road, unless you are on your way to love land."
Cool,"It probably takes <1 min on this road as not much time is needed at this place. The vehicle will appear to be moving up slope when the engine is offed, should only visit when you are just nice passing by the area, purposely detour just to see this road is not needed to me."
Interesting,"I've never done something like this before so it was a first time for me. We tried it in one direction but it didn't work, but when we tried it in the opposite direction (heading away from Loveland), it works and the car accelerated to 13 km/hr whilst on neutral. I would recommend a visit here if you haven't done something like it before."
Interesting ,"Close to the Jeju Loveland Park and worth the stop. Mind boggling how a car moves up a hill, merely a trick of the eye."
Underwhelmed ,This really just felt like wasted time on the tour. These optical illusions can be found almost anywhere and is not a part of what I would consider makes Jeju-do a unique place to visit.Do yourself a favor and skip it. 
Mysterious road,"Took quite some time to find the road. I was there few years ago and I find it very interesting, but this week when I bring my family there, I was very disappointed. We drive pass a few small stalls and want to try on the road and the nearby stall owner was very rude and tell us not to park in front of him. Thus we drive up and down slowly and try on the gravity without having the hand break on. It's a 5 minute thing, will not go again."
Cool experience ,"So we are sat in the car, put on neutral mode and the car actually moved! This is a really cool experience and it only takes a minute to do- I have seen mysterious roads on the travel channel before but this was my first time doing it- if you find yourself on Jeju island check it out!"
A quick stopover,Spending a good 10-15 mins would be enough for this site. It was fascinating. You should try rolling an empty bottle/can on the road and see it roll forward on a uphill road. (optical illusion).
Cool but not worth it,"Experiencing the Jeju Mysterious Road was cool for a few minutes. But that's about it.If you're gonna drive a few hours just to see it, I'd say just look for another attraction. But if it's just near you, go ahead and experience it. "
Awh! So cool!,Have you been to a road where cars move on it's own? This is my first experience. It's so cool and the car just move along the stretch of flat road. What could be the reason? Our guide said that it could be the magnetic effect from the earth. It's something that you can only find it here. Well!! At least for me it's the only one of this kind so far until I discover more. Regret no photos taken here coz it was raining when we were here for this experience.
Interesting experience if you are nearby,Firstly do not travel here for the sole purpose of this attraction otherwise you will be disappointed. Was around the area as I went to Loveland. The Korean GPS number gives you the wrong coordinates so follow my direction. When you exit Loveland turn left and it will be ~100m down. You need to drive further up past the point where it says start and make a U-turn in order to start the experience.
So mysterious!!,"Due to the bad weather and rain, my friends and I just managed to experience the mysterious road inside our tour guide's car. The car is moving upward when our pretty tour guide turn off the car engine and the car keep moving up... If you have the chance, experience yourself!!!"
Interesting. ,Ok place . If schedule tight may skip the place. Nth special. Just a short vehicle rolling to upward slope. 
"The car will go in reverse, even though the slope is in the opposite direction","The taxi driver showed me this while I was headed to Love Land (nearby). He put the car in neutral near the convenience store area, and even though it slopes downward, the car will roll backward. It was cool, free, and quick. I would not divert from an itinerary to experience this, however if you want a free thrill, check it out."
Nothing special,"Was in the area, so decided to have a look at this phenomenon.Turns out to be optical illusion.Tourists were trying to get their cars rolling ""up"" the slope, children were trying to get bottles rolling, and local drivers were getting annoyed making more aggressive manoeuvers than usual"
Nothing much to rave about,Its a road with a convenience store beside it. Children would have fun to see how the water flows uphill but other then that not much else
Now I know the mystery,When I heard there is a mysterious road in my tour itinerary. I was thinking what the he** is that? Now I know. The world has lot of unanswered questions.
Really mysterious ...,Is just a short road to be amazed. Not worth to travel so far. Saw people trying to roll water bottle on the road and ignoring oncoming cars. 
Surprise,We went here by bus. We were not allowed to get off the bus. It might be a nice moment but not if you sit in the rear part of the bus.
Optical issue,Basically this is interesting place ... might be mystic but in fact it is optical fake which makes you thing that items go up to hill. In fact road still goes down.
Unbelievable uphill and downhill rule.. it is against..,The stretch of road looks like it's uphill but rolling a water bottle will make it roll uphill instead of downhill. It's interesting to explore.
Gravity hill,"Since Jeju is best travelled by car, the mysterious road (it's actual name) is definitely worth checking out. Putting the car on the apparent downslope in neutral gear will make the car move backwards and vice-versa...freaked us out until we discovered the optical illusion behind it. Be careful of all the other cars trying it out as well as pedestrians attempting something similar by pouring water onto the road surface."
Not sure what the mystery is....,2nd time here but still not convinced about the mystery...only thing is that the car can move on its own without stepping on the accelerator
Not worth,Not worth the long drive to find out the mysterious answer in less than a minute. Is all within one eyesight !
MYSTERIOUS ROAD LOST ITS EFFECT??,We drove along mountainous route 1139 from SEOQWIPO to this place before heading to the airport. We drove very slowly from the start to finish point and didn't feel the illusion effect. Some said to see the effect one needs to roll a bottle on the road. I dunno.. i just drove on without stopping. I would however recommend those who drive to drive along route 1139 skirting the mountain and reaching the 1000m height.
Optical illusion,"Interesting spot but nothing to WOW about, just an optical illusion so when you are traveling ""up"" the slope but in actual fact, you are going ""down"" a slope (a few degrees). Roll a bottle and you would be able to tell the difference."
Nothing mystery,"This mystery road is just a small portion of a long road with many undulating slopes. There is sign broad showing the start of the mystery. Both sides of the road has plantation indicating the road is up slope. Vehicles with engine killed will moves slowly from the start point with the plantation effect. At the ending point when out from the vehicle, looking at the road as if you are on the top of the small gradient.According to academic research, it is actually down slope but due to side plantation causing people to view wrongly."
Guess it would be cool if I had a car ...,"I came here by bus .. so I waited for the bus and cars to go on neutral and watch them drive up he hill hands free.Some people poured water while other rolled a water bottle.Since this attaction takes less than 15 minutes, i would suggest also going the Jeju Art Museum next door :)"
Uh...It's Neat? I Guess?,"Don't go out of your way for this, lol. It's not an ""attraction"" per se, but if you are driving and this is on your way somewhere (like it was for us), you may as well check it out for the five seconds of amusement you will get from it."
Family with young kids,Its indeed mysterious rd!! A kind that cannot be found anywhere else.. Very unique n puzzled s we did experimented few times from the start to the end...
Just a road.,"If you're a free and easy traveller, I'll totally not recommend you to travel to see this mysterious road. If you're on a tour bus, this is an interesting experience. "
"Cool, but not a must. ","We had a taxi tour and this just happened to be on the way to a museum. It was neat to experience and see, but I wouldn't stop by if it was out of the way. "
Not worth your time ,The only thing mysterious about it was what was worth the mystery of the road. If this is attraction worthy... Oh well. Some people are amused by the littlest things. Must be nice. 
Honeymoon @ Jeju Mysterious Road,"We gave a 4 stars owing to its mysterious element.The 100m stretch of road appears to be uphill but it is actually and in fact downhill. This can be done by several experiments. E.g. pour water on the road, put a bottle of water and it will roll towards the ""uphill"", walk or run backward along this road; you will feel the difference whether it's uphill or downhill.There are a few stalls selling food so you can eat and think how this is possible."
A really mysterious road!,"We went to this road and true enough, mysteriously, the van moved despite the fact that the driver stopped the engine. whew what a mysterious road!"
Mystery needn't to be solved,"It is a good experience to be there and see how mystery the road was. We were with our kind tour guide that gave us an experiment to test the road. Pour water and see where it flows, true enough it was a mystery (still need not to be solved)."
Mysterious....,"Not a must-visit but it's good place to explore for first-timers. The stretch of road looks like it's uphill but rolling a water bottle will make it roll uphill instead of downhill. It's interesting to watch. Since I self-drive, there is no exact gps phone number for this but you can key in Loveland and you will see signboard to mysterious road. Parking here is free and there's a nearby convenience store and one can chill at caffe bene afterwards."
A normal sloped road,A normal sloped road which may not be worth it if you have limited time on jeju. A little over-hyped.
Mysterious indeed,"We were on a tour bus when we passed by the road. There were quite a lot of people so we couldn't really go down and take pictures. It was literally a 5 minute driveby. Luckily, I was near the front so I had a view of the road and it's optical illusions. I recommend coming with a rented car or taxi, not with a big group. Then you get to really appreciate why it's called the Mysterious Road. I heard from our tour guide that some golf ranges in the area have the same effect to. Golfers should ask around so you can play there. "
So mysterious...and we feel nothing..not impressed at all,"My suggestion... not a must tourist attraction to target..Find another truly mysterious attractionAlthough attributed with story about when and how this mysterious road appear to be odd, still nothing can retain in memory Skip it from your agenda"
Try and figure it out!,It was amazing! One seemed to be on a uphill yet the car was moving backwards. And vice versa. Try using an empty water bottle (cylindrical in shape) to test it out as well.
2 minutes of joy,Nothing much else to write about except that it will take you 2 minutes to experience this and is really close to Love Land which is something you should checkout.
Mysterious Road,Unusual phenomena as our stationery car that was on neutral could roll upwards by itself. Other than that nothing to shout about 
Amazing! ,Was feeling really amazing when passing through this road. The tour bus was moving even though the driver has turned of the machine. Recommended anyone coming to Jeju to try this herself/himself.* TK 
Unique road,Visit if you are free as there are other roads like this in many parts of the world. Objects roll up the slope appearing to go against gravity however its due to an optical illusion. If you visit make sure you try it yourself.
Car moving on its own,"When car stops the engine, it goes on its own. Other than this, nothing special. However, we have tried to use wheelchair to see whether any similar effect, its not working."
Unique road,"I forgot why, but in this road even your car have been turn off , your car is still moving, but i forget the reason"
For the Inqusitive - Jeju Mysterious Road,Nothing spectacular but wouldn't mind a stop by as its along the way to nearby restaurants. Should try the hot rice cake and fish cake though.
Worth a 5 minute stop,"Looks just like a normal road, except that due to the slant of the trees it appears like things are going uphill. A trick of the eye, and a cute experience."
Optical illusion street?,"It is just a street; however, I was surprised when I put down my Evian bottle water n it started to roll by it self (fast enough) even though it was put on a flat street."
Mind Boggling,Spent no more than 30 mins. Witness how nature trick our mind. Looks as if it is an uphill road but in actual fact it is downhill. Have a bite at the stalls beside the road.
The Mysterious Road,We came to The Mysterious Road and it's said that when you're going uphill but actually it's you've going flat Road or otherwise!But I couldn't feel anything so in the end we just took some photos and go to another destination.
Sloppy road,Nothing special about this road. Not recommended just to travel there unless u got nothing else to do. Just some eyes tricking stuff 
Good fun!,This is where physics takes over. Let the fun takes over. What you see don't really make sense until the guide explains it to you. All in natural surroundings and in good time. Don't forget to try out the street food there while you are at it. Made my day. Cheers again! 
Interesting,"The driver dropped us there on a rainy evening. It was a nice experience because it makes you wonder why would the vehicle move 'upwards' after the driver has killed off the car engine. Due to communication barrier (a Korean driver), she could not explain it well to us. However, it is still interesting."
Very short quiet road,It's a short quiet road so do keep a lookout when you are near. We tried to pour water but it didn't go against gravity as mentioned.
Impressed for this Mysterious Road,"Actually originally didn't think to visit this place. But coincidence have the chance, me and my travel partners was shock to see with our own eyes for the water and bottle both run to the upfront road which its was suppose to be opposite way....Make youself drop by to see this amazing effect while you around in Jeju. This place is just very nearby the Sex Museum which we didn't go but passby~"
Check it out!!,We drove there since we have a rental car.Indeed the vehicle moves uphill on its own when in neutral.Interesting.Need to figure why though!
The road where things roll uphill?!,"This is a very interesting place to visit. Our driver put his car in neutral gear, turned off the engine and put his keys on the dashboard, and the car rolled uphill! We got off and watched other people put bottles of water on the road and they rolled uphill as well! It is actually an optical illusion, but still a strange sight to behold. You don't have to stay here for long - maybe 30 minutes will do."
Cool !,Been here since in tour itinerary and feel amused! Our big bus with 30people in it still able to run when the driver put the engine in off position! And it's quite fast as well maybe 20-30km/hr When we off from our bus and try to pour a water they go to the side or even go up instead of flow down. Recommended tourist spot to visit and try by yourself!
Amazing,"Curious a lot but not much time belong the legend story about this road is looking down n the cover of seems getting up by tree for side of this road. We tried to engine off and its moving forward, nice its like magic. "
mysterious road 😁,"Trying this if you hire a car and drive thru it.basically turn to neutral gear, car will move eventually.suppose a down slope instead of up?Go experience it! is nearby Loveland. "
Amazing experience,With regards as unable to download the recorded clip. Was a fun experience. Located just outside of Famous Love land. A start & end point we clearly shown. 
Gravity defying magic,"There are sign posts to mark the start and end of the 100 metres stretch of the Mysterious Road. Pretty fun to play ""magic"" with family and friends. Put your car to neutral gear, release your foot off the accelerator and notice the car moving ""uphill"" on the road. Recreate the same effect with a bottle or ball rolling uphill. The Mysterious Road is actually a gravity hill i.e. a place where a slight downhill slope appears to be an uphill slope due to higher surroundings, creating the natural illusion that water flows uphill or that a car left out of gear rolls uphill. Worth a fun stop if you self-drive!"
Pretty Unique,"Visually, the road is seen to be an uphill road. But when the bus driver turned off the engine and release the brakes, it starts to move forward. Quite interesting. But don't purposely go there unless it's part of the journey. Not worth."
Mysterious,The bus and car will still move while the enhine turns off. Use a bottle of mineral water to try. Just stop and try. 
Only worthwhile as part of a tour package,"It is only mildly interesting as part of a tour package which include this as a drive-through attraction.Plenty of cars & coaches stop & have their engines turned off to experience the ""rolling uphill"" mysterious effect.It is quite interesting to see how this phenomenon and the perception of the surrounding environment to the naked eyes has come so far to give birth to a tourist attraction. It could also double as a quick pit-stop to grab some snacks & skewers at the food store along the road.Hint: Get there, spend 5-10min walking one way forward, and then walking backward, or lay a half filled water bottle on the road, to crack this mystery."
A little mysterious but quite interesting,it is kind of mysterious to the naked eye but in real fact it is just your eyes playing tricks on you. Interesting though
Not that special,"If you have a lot of things you want to do in Jeju and are driving to do them, this is just kind of unnecessary. I actually had a hard time getting what I was supposed to do and once I did it I was like, meh, that was kind of a waste of time. Just keep driving to your next location."
Fun to do for 10 mins,Was fascinating to watch cars and buses stop and roll uphill. A skateboard would gave been useful. My insect repellent definitely rolled uphill for a bit.
Mildly interesting,"Few hundred feet of road that makes you feel like your rolling uphill with the car in neutral. Best is to begin at the start point from a full stop place the car in neutral and release the brake, the car will begin to roll very slowly and it appears that you are going up a slight incline. I would not go out of my way for this... although I did. If you have plenty of time or nothing to do because of rain then why not."
Unique,"Couldn't believe eyes when the car started to go ""uphill"" even though the engine has been turned off. My son and nephews put a water bottle on the road and it rolled ""uphill"". Very unique "
You have to try it to believe it,"Tip: when you are on that road uphill, please put the car into NEUTRAL gear & switch OFF your engine. That's the only way to test. You will then see that the car is indeed going uphill when gravity tells you that you should be descending downhill on that slope.Having the engine on would offset the effect.Try it."
So mysterious,This road is a must place to visit. It is weird and so cool. You can experience something that you never see before. I recommend you to come to here if you visit jeju.
Science experiment,Bring half full water bottle and try to experience the car is moving uphill without engine running! Don't forget to give hazard signal when you try this experiment ;)
"Small, but worth a visit","I have driven pass this place coincidentally It's quite unique place, worth a visit. A few shops, restaurants, café, and street food markets."
Only if you have plenty of time,We stop here on the way to the airport. It's quiet interesting experience when the car moves. Can't help laughing inside the car as the power is off but it still moves.
Uphill the Mysterious road on Neutral,"Put your rented car on neutral going ""uphill"" and experience it. Mysterious probably because for most it’s a baffling experience having your car in neutral but going uphill, backwards or forward – hands off the wheel and feet off that pedal. The place is on the way to Jusangjeolli by way of the Mount Halla route from Jeju town. 5-10 minutes (no crowd here) and you have covered one of the “touristy” sites in Jeju. A woman attempted to see what would happen with a plastic water bottle placed on the road, nothing did. Why would any vehicle with so much metals built into it got pulled but not a plastic bottle? Go figure. I have encountered a similar experience at a site in Saudi Arabia near Madinah which has a longer stretch for that “mysterious” experience. "
Impressive but too short,"Just like everyone already mentioned, the road is indeed mysterious as the car would really move uphill on its own. However, it is only a very short stretch of the road. But I would still recommend it if you are self-driving and it's your first time in Jeju. Definitely, something you have to experience.You can also head to the museums that is nearby too after going to this road."
Mysterious?,"It is indeed mysterious as to why this spot is named as mysterious road and promoted as such (there are road signs giving directions to the spot in the city). I think the road is not steep enough so that when the car is put to neutral, it goes too slow to create an impressive illusion."
Maybe good for family with kids,"The place is good only for families with little children.Kids will be excited about the fact that a car(or bottle) seems to go up on downhill. However, for adults? Not really...If u have plenty of time to spend on the road."
Kind of odd.,"Drove to this portion of road after Mount Hallasan. There is a sign that says ""start of Mysterious Road"", but it neglects to tell you to put your car in neutral at that point. We didn't do it and were wondering what the big deal was. After having waited in a slowdown of cars we decided that we didn't want to try again. Had a great laugh!"
Review of a 14 year old girl,"For some reason, we did not manage to see the optical illusion during our visit. However, the environment was nice so we had quite a great time there."
Not so mysterious,"Don't make a special trip to see this place, Only interesting if you pass by. I mean, it's only a piece of road where you turn off the engine on the incline and watch the car roll for a few yards. We've got more interesting mystery spot in Santa Cruz, Calif."
Fascinating stop,It's not just any road. Free your gear and drive uphill! Is that possible? Not according to science. But you could do so at Jeju's Mysterious Road. Sometimes your eye may play tricks on you. Find out how on this road.
Only Stop if You're in the Area,"This site is just around the corner from Love Land, so if you're in the area or need a restroom, stop. Otherwise, don't waste your time and gas just to drive here.When you see a bunch of cars with their hazards on, moving very slowly next to the 7-Eleven, you know you've arrived. Put your car into Neutral and watch as you slowly appear to roll up hill."
Amazing!,It's the magic of science that explains all what a human naked eye cannot see or realize if not explained. Must see this magic trick of earth's wonder. RockNroll!
A fun out door illusion,"Not a must visit, though a spot of fun if you have 15 minutes free as your vehicle seemingly rolls its way 'up' a hill."
Outdoor illusion,"Jeju-do best attraction, the Mysterious Road (Dokkaebi Road) or Goblin road as folk story say, it was the goblins who does the trick.. sound interesting. Young and old will find this place fun and mysterious. All you have to do is just stop your car at the designation point, on the double sign(emergency light), off the engine, release the hand brake and let the car move up the hill by itself, 'Yes.. roll up the hill'.The best is, this attraction is free of charge. Along the Mysterious Road, have a few food stall, try out the grilled black pork sausage and many delicious food. For those driving, key in the number 7126988 (yup.. heading to Loveland, you will reach Mysterious Road first), most people stop by here on the way to airport."
Vision trick,"It is just a vision trick. The road appears going up when it is really going down, so cars and buses can glide down when put in neutral. The way the trees at the side of the road is planted tricks your vision. Coming from Canada, we have seen it similar to the one in Moncton, New Brunswick. "
Fun iĺlusion,"We intentionally left town on an alternate route so that we could see this road, and it was well worth the extra few minutes. Follow the directions and have fun! If you want to view the road correctly, then pull into the parking lot behind the pig monuments :-)"
mysterious,"if you go by walk don't bother to go there, you can't notice anything apart from cars driving very slow"
Mysterious Road!,"It is really a mysterious road!!! It is a upslope. However when u off engine, the car will move dwn by itself"
A brief stop on our trip,Our tour guide took us there and the road ahead seemed to be uphill when viewing from our tour bus. Our driver then put the bus in neutral gear and amazingly our bus moved slowly up (actually down) the road by itself. An interesting optical illusion. 
Fun to visit it if it is on your way,To experience something different something unique not know how the car keeps going with the Engine turned off. We did it on our way over and our way back to the hotel. It was fun to see all the tourist on the roads waiting to see each car going without the start of the engine.
Very close to the main road for a quick visit.,"Our driver/tour guide took us here on the way back to the hotel. Actually, he said it was his first time there as well. My 17-year old son and I felt the uphill rolling and it was a weird feeling. Not sure why it was doing it, but we saw some tourists pouring water on the pavement and watching the water rolling uphill. Many years ago, I took my son to a similar ""mystery road"" in Manzanillo, Mexico. Back then, may be he was too young to feel it, or may be I was a terrible tour guide, but this time he finally got it. So, it was fun for us to take the quick detour and had some laughs. Oh, and it was free and there are road signs tell you how to experience the ""mystery""."
"Not that cool, but worth it if on the way. ","We had no plans to see this, but on our way to the airport, we stumbled upon it. Put the car in neutral and slowly rolled ""up hill"". We laughed for the 15 second experience and went on our way. Certainly not worth going out of the way to get there. "
Amazing,"You put your car gear on neutral without stepping on the accelerator, the car will move by itself even though the road is flat. There is 7-11 next to it. Within 5 minutes walk is The Loveland."
Optical Illusion,Put your vehicle on neutral and it will seemingly be rolling uphill. Very intriguing.Unable to figure out how it happened but definitely have something to do with the way the trees were planted along the road.
Need to drive in order to have a full experience,"Drive yourself to the 100m stretch of road. When see the ""start"" marker, put your gear to neutral and you will notice that the car is moving forward even as you are going uphill without engaging any gear. Pretty interesting short experience. "
"Wow, explain that!",Arrived and saw many tourist came by bus just to check out the road. We tried with our car and it really goes up the hill with free gear. A place shouldn't be missed if driving from jeju city to seogwipo.
Similar to Mystery Spot in Santa cruz just a little weaker,The car can move uphill in neutral gear. Water will flow uphill. Ball will roll up hill. These are the things that happen in mysterious Road. 
Mysterious magnetic field road?,"This place near Sex Land, our chauffeur driver show us (by turning off the machine) that the car still able to move even the machine is completely off."
5-10 min. With bathroom,"Only works in one direction. Good pit stop bathroom is next to it. It was cool. 5-10 minutes. Pretty area. Cute, fun, short and quick. If you just want to try something different and free, this might be a little fun if you are already in the area south west-ish of jeju city. "
puzzling...,the engine of the bus I am in was switch-off and yet it continue to move upwards.. only a stretch of about 250m of road.... a bottle of mineral water seems to roll upwards too...most puzzling was a bus moves up faster than a sedan car...simply strange...
MYSTERIOUSLY AMAZING!,"Your few minutes here are worth it! It is a short mystery road wherein vehicles are moving by itself. Optical illusion or not, it is still mysterious! Most tourist visit this! You should also try and see for your self."
MR ANN IS AWESOME,"hello folks looking for a driver. Mr Ann is who i recommend. he is friendly with decent english. His english is optimal for getting by. Not only that but his charges are very affordable. He has many clean and nice taxis with fresh air . He is able to take 2 to 10 or more people. Having worked as a tour guide for 10 years or more with a huge diversity of customers from all over, he is genuinely a good guide. He drives fast but safe recommends cheap and good quality food. He taught us lots of korean jeju culture too. With him as my guide 2 days in jeju wasnt enough. overall like what many others said he not only proactively takes many pictures for us but also brings us to as many places as possible, giving us alone time too. He brought us to eat black pork, tea museum, folk village, mount hallasang, glass museum, trick eye museum, love museum, the maze place, a beach, udo island, and many many other scenic places that you can take good shots. "
Mystery of the Mysterious Road,It's just a short stretch of road which claims that vehicle on it moves by itself. Sounds interesting but you got to be there yourself to see it and solve the mystery! 
This truly is Mysterious,"Optical allusion or not, this is head scratching. I stood at bottom and then put car in neutral, it rolled uphill. Best yet, poured water on road and it too flowed up?close to airport and worth the few minutes drive to see."
A real mystery! Best tried with car!,"There's a starting point and ending point, that shows this mysterious road's gravitational force. Many went with tour buses but it's best to experience this in your own rented car! Switch to neutral and let the mystery begin! "
Mysteryyyyyyyyyyyy!,"I was here with my family. Thinking what is so mysterious about this road? Its just a road, with nature on the sides. It’s just another “normal” road. Sigh, a total waste of time.Until I reach the place, I was blown away! Not because of the strong wind (I was there when it was raining heavily with strong winds), but the mysterious part of this road. I was told to stay in the car, to witness the mystery of this road. The engine got turned off, hand brake was let gone, brakes were let gone too, the car automatically went up the slope by itself!It is a new experience here for me in Jeju, a totally worth of time to visit!"
Defying gravity?? Omo!!,"We really had to experience the mysterious behind this road, car/vehicle in neutral gear and it shifts upward the hilly road! Amazing, mashaAllah!"
It's just a very distance,"Today me and other guest are very lucky that the hostel owners very kind and friendly gave us a ride back to hostel, on the way back, he just de route to show us this place which near to love land, it's just a very short distance which the road seems like is going up slop, but, when the car put on free gear at the starting point, the car is actually keep moving on downhill. Visitors having fun by placing drinking water bottles on the road and let the bottle roll on its own. Personally, nothing very special, its just kind of illusions optic. "
Up , The car drives up the road by itself! Great fun. ( visual effect)It only works one way. You need to drive in neutral towards the shops. If you arrived from Jejusi do a U turn after the shops to experience the effect. The effect is quite spectacular with a water bottle placed in the middle of the road. You will see clearly the bottle rolling up. 
Bizarre experience!,"This road is really a mystery, Indeed am intrigued by this stretch of the road as your car on free gear can move by itself. definitely worth to try this road out if you have a car just for the fun of it."
Interesting!,It was interesting place with the thinking of what the hell we are going uphill when we are suppose to go downhill...real mysterious road. It our eye that doing the illusion. This is a must when u are in JeJu.
Good experience if you have a car,"This is a small stretch of road. The GPS setting is 7126988 ( which is for Loveland) but you turn off just before it. The stretch is about 50 m. There is a start and stop sign. At the start sign, set gear to neutral and off the brakes and watch your car go uphill. It is quite fun because of the optical illusion. No fun if you don't drive. "
Clever tourism,"It's amazing how enterprising the locals (or promoters of tourism) have been! Without spoiling for others, and if you are into 'problem solving' give it a go! Our coach drove pass the road and we were asked to solve the mystery!!! Bit of fun."
Nothing much,"I drove there so we could feel the effect. However if you're not, it's not as interesting as it seems to be."
5 mins thrill just for fun,"As my title states, 5 mins thrill just for fun but the thrill is only for the driver or people who drive."
have to experience th,"Best way is to go to the starting point (where it's steepest and most deceptive). Make sure that there's no car or people behind you, put car in N, then release your brake too, to see you and your car going backwards UP the hill. "
Lost it's magic?,"We had a hard time locating the exact spot and drove around a few times. It was also a foggy day which made it worse. When we finally reached the sign that shows the start point, we tried to see if the car would defy gravity but it didn't. We tried twice. It was really a short stretch of road and we gave up. Sad. Perhaps we should go with a guide next time. "
Mysterious indeed~~,It was really amazing to witness the mystery~ Cool experience that you won't get it elsewhere~ Go and witness the mystery yourselves~~
Just mysterious ,It was so cool and mysterious. Very interesting experience in Jeju island. You have to have a car to experience the mystery. Don't forget to turn on hazard light! 
"A free stuff, fun if you drive your car","Here is the best was to try the experience of climbing up the hill Come from the loveland (from the north) and stop at what seems to the bottom of the hill (there will be a sign on the other sign of the road)Stop your car, go in neutral put you warning signals on.Make sure there is no pedestrian and car behind you and release the break The car will start climbing the hill in reverse mode It is a bit dangerous as there are lot of pedestrian and potential drivers that dont understand what you are doing but really the best way to experience the illusion"
Interesting,Cool experience. Not too hard to figure out the mystery but fun! We had a taxi hired and she drove us to the spot and turned off the engine and the car was rolling uphill! I loved it when she did it backwards. Pretty trippy. wouldn't go out of the way to see it but Loveland is literally right next to it so you might as well!
Really mysterious!,"Nice to view such a mysterious road. Not easy to believe, but true! Worth to go there and make a believe!"
marvellous,want to see magic?pls come & experience the wonderful nature of a defying gravity experience. every movable objects will easily goes up if the hill
Interesting ,"It's very near to Loveland. Interesting to see the car roll forward upslope. Start on the south, towards Jeju city. Length of the road is quite short, maybe 50m?"
Interesting to see when passing by,"We just stumbled across this attraction when visiting somewhere else. There was quite a few people there and people seemed to be very interested in the mysterious road. We didn't try driving on it, we just stood and watched the cars.Basically it's a road with a slope, but the cars roll backwards up the slope with the engine turned off. It was quite intriguing to witness and I would definitely recommend seeing it if you are in the area. I wouldn't travel ages to see it though. Right next to the Mysterious Road is street food and drinks if hungry! "
Interesting,We got our tour from rakso travel most of the filipino tourist are with the whole family. Mystery road is quite interesting for the whole group but you can spend 30 mins there after the demonstration and a little discussion all is good to go.
Mysterious Road..,"This Mysterious Road is nothing very special actually, but it can explain by the Physics explanation why we see downhill road but the car can climb up without engine on.. hehe.. so there nothing spooky here.."
Very mysterious!,I found the second part of the drive more interesting and mysterious. The second part is having the car on neutral and it mysteriously reversing. You have to experience it for yourself! Doesn't take too much time of your day.
Amazing experience,It is really mind blowing. Hard to believe that it will happen like that. Just go there for a short while. It wont eat your time :)
"Interesting road, but not really that worth it","It is an interesting road and we had a car so we can do it a few times. I would say that if you are not going in that direction, there is no need to drive there specially for it."
What a different experience,If I hadn't done this myself I don't think I would have believed it. You look like you are ascending up this road when the car is in neutral you actually roll down it! It's a MUST DO if you come to Jeju.
DID WE MOVE????? I FELT SOMETHING!!!!,"This is just another roadside attraction where you stop your car on a road and if you're lucky and the wind is blowing your car will seem to roll up hill. You might think that the world is about to end or that little green men have finally arrived but, it is just an optical illusion. The lay of the land and the slope of the road is all it is. If you're driving past it wouldn't hurt to stop and check it out. Just a few minutes is all you need. If you stop by keep an open mind and don't expect too much. It might help if you have a few drinks before you go, (but no drinking and driving).What is a mystery to me is who discovered it and how and why?"
No big deal,A road built with a surroundings with a slight downhill slope which appear to be uphill. Its just an optical illusion. No big deal.
5mins for experience,"Just take 5mins so why not? :) come and experience it, though it is not really a mystery anymore as science has it clarified."
The road that defiles gravity,"Interesting experience as we we pull to neutral gear, release the accerator, the car just go forward, upwards. The mysterious road is short, we made a few rounds. There is a car park where you turn in to go a few rounds if you wanted to. We tried the same stretch to road after the end point. The car just go backward on the upward facing slope. "
"If you have nothing to do, go there","We went there with a bus group, they organized a lot of activities and Mysterious road was one of these. We found out it's too crowded and there's nothing to see and to do, it's normal street, they said that the cars will move without a driver, but you can't see it or feel it, just the driver feels that. overall don't go there if specially for the street if it's on your way or you are with a group it's okay."
Nothing much,Experience⭐⭐⭐⭐Time worth⭐⭐⭐This attraction is basically a road. Just a road. With mysterious powers. Go there yourself to see if it's really that great because when we went to the mysterious road the bus driver switched off the engine and the bus continued moving along the road without any power. Mysterious. Aha. I don't know what's so fun about this road but I'll just give it a 4⭐ rating
"Interesting visual effect, affecting judgement","This is an interesting short stretch of a public road, but only within the designated posts. You can feel the elevation, but visually it was conflicted. But watch out for traffic though. A 30 min will suffice."
Try it yourself!,"You will have to try it youself to experience it! Tried it with a water bottle but it doesn't work. Tried it with a car and shifted to neutral, the car will ascend the inclining road. Quite interesting but will be bored after 5 minutes."
Not worth it at all!,I was with a local Korean friend that didn't understand himslef what the fuss was all about... Unless it's on your way you can skip it!
Optical illusion,"We were there on a tour bus, the trick to this road is actually from the surrounding which trick your eyes into believing that you are going up hill when in fact the slope is going downhill. Only go to this place if you are part of the tour otherwise waste of time."
Dont visit unless on a tour.,"Was on YEHA bus tour (which is really great), but this particular place is not that special. Do not spend any time going here unless it is included in some tour package. Basically a road where stuff kind-a sort-a roll upwards but not really.I was more interested of the over-priced street food and the pig statues down the road."
It's Not That Mysterious,"Yes, you will able to see water bottle accend up the road without any force applied to it and when you switch off your car engine or shift to Neutral, your car still able to accend the inclining road. But after 10 minutes, you will be bored and it's only work a certain stretch of road only."
Quick stop,Pretty interesting how the car can move even when the engine is turned off. What's beneath the road?
Really?,"I came here as its right next to Loveland. Total waste of time, no idea what was going on. Just lots of coaches that slow down and wait for the ""gravity"" to take hold causing a huge traffic pile up. Odd"
Done in 5mins.,Just a road that seem to go against law of physics.Need a car to see how it roll uphill or maybe some water to see how the water flows.
Quick 15 Min Visit,Optical illusion on this road. looks to slope in one direction but actually flows the other way. Pretty cool spot to check out if nothing else but for a photo op. Should be done in 15-20 mins tops 
Do some experiments,"It's just a road, but if you want to make it interesting, do some experiment on it. Get out of your vehicle, and try walking down/up the road. Or test the road by pouring water/ walk inversely. We enjoyed it!"
Don't waste time,"Really nothing, if you don't focus, it's just another roadUnless you have spare time. Else I will recommend to skip it. Don't even know realize we were there"
Amazing but transport is an issue,"Needs to be in a vehicle to enjoy this amazing experience, though we also pour water on the road to see how it flow ""uphill"". Noticed local bus tour also pass through this attraction, but I'm not sure if they will allow the passengers to get off the bus and do the experiment."
Really Interesting,Really Really Interesting! Don't know the reason why but it's really interesting and worth to go and see. 
Optical illusion,"Basically nothing much here. The road seemed to be uphill and when the engine of the vehicle is switched off, it will ""roll uphill"". However, it is a natural optical illusion, and the road is actually downhill. Spend not more than 15mins here if you drive as the road is just about 50 metres. Also, the ""rolling down"" phenomenon only works on large vehicles like buses or truck. Small saloon cars will not encounter the ""rolling uphill"" effect."
Optical illusion,The main culprit for this optical illusion is the fence. Be sure to bring water bottle with you and let it roll.
Really mysterious road,"Very interesting road that the car or bus or water bottle can walk by themself without anything, very weird "
Not bad. Optical illusion.,It is one of a few place with optical illusion on the slop of the road. First time seen this kind of scene.If anyone had any experience at other country. I guess it is just the same.
Fun Stop While Driving,"This is a fun place to stop and spend about a half hour or so. The road in this section appears to defy gravity. Not sure of the reason why, but is very interesting to see the car go backwards while facing downhill. There are some interesting exhibits and statues, along with shops, nearby."
Fun,Get your mind going with this one. Make sure to have a round ball or bottle with you. Just try and figure it out.lol
"optical illusion, not worth the drive","Possibly the only amazing thing about this ""attraction"" is the number of tourists it attracts. It is mildly amusing to see the road apparently sloping in the opposite direction, but not really worth the drive to get there - only plan a visit if you're going somewhere else nearby, such as Loveland.I was in a car with 3 other people and I was the only one who could see the illusion, so be aware that not everybody can see it."
MUST VISIT!,"It's a must go place, you will see how gravity works differently. Really enjoy ""playing"" around this area. hahaha.. Just go and play! :)"
"Optical dilusion, tricky yet interesting however ","Travelled on September using the busdaytour. Its strange in this 100meter road, how it seemed to be going up, but yet though our bus' machine has been turned off, our bus seems to be going up, in about 5-10km/hour. Jeju people called this the ghost road, where they say that the ghosts are pushing us up. "
Backward roads,"Full of tour buses and tourists at this ""mysterious road""! We drove by and made a quick pit stop! Nothing much except seeing bewildered tourists!"
Interesting,Car is going backward at down slope road. Mysterious! Interesting. Can incorporate into your itinerary. The place is not very big. Nothing much other than the road.
Strange and Unexplainable,"Our guide brought us to this place, let us alight and asked us to observe the strange phenomenon. He switched off the car engine and we saw the car still moving uphill without the engine switched on. He then demonstrated by pouring a bottle of water at one spot along the road and we could see the trail of water wriggled its way uphill without the application of any external interferences. The phenomenon was strange and unexplainable. Was it that a magnetic force beneath the earth on this road had triggered off that momentum? My guide did not explain and I could not find any explanation on any of the signboards around the vicinity. I remembered few years back when I was in Shanghai, I visited the mausoleum of the great Chinese revolutionary martyr, Song Qingling which was located at the western part of the city. Prior to her demise, she had requested that her body be buried at this cemetery site beside her late parents, the influential and rich Song family. I was astonished to learn from our tour guide and saw with my own eyes the strange phenomenon of the cypress and pine trees planted around the mausoleum was bending inwards and downwards from all angles towards the direction of the cemetery site where her body was buried. It was not just the left rows of trees, not just the right rows of trees but the trees planted at all the other corners surrounding the rectangular burial plot that were seen pointing inwards and downwards with the focus at the burial ground. The lush green trees appeared like bodyguards saluting, bending their heads and standing humbly for her directions. My guide informed us that the cemetery was a specially chosen grand and auspicious geomancy burial ground and that account for the strange phenomenon. The Chinese believed that if your body is buried on an auspiciously good Fengshui geomancy chosen ground, your future generations will benefit and prosper. I am not an expert in Fengshui and was hoping to get a scientific explanation for the weird phenomenon. Right here, at this strange mysterious road in Jeju, I was also trying to observe if the trees growing around the vicinity of the mysterious road bend towards and focused at the core center where the strange phenomenon occurred but I could not see what I saw at Song Qingling's mausoleum. Both strange phenomenon seemed to be unrelated in their nature and in terms of scientific theory of explanation that a strong magnetic force beneath the earth is in operation. The `Bermuda Triangle' is also another unexplainable phenomenon whereby it was unexplainable as to where so many ships vanished in strange occurring environment. I had watched a Chinese TV series on science whereby the film director sought to provide scientific explanations to the many strange `unexplainable' and `supernatural' phenomenon around China. I really hope that some days, the same film director could incorporate the strange phenomenon that occurred at this mysterious road, the ship vanishing Bermuda Triangle and that of the Song Qingling's burial site in his series and provide a scientific theoretical explanation for the weird occurrence. The visit to this mysterious road had triggered off my curiosity and I left the place, confused and thinking of the limits in science."
"A bit of a let down but nice stores, cafes, and stone art","We visited this road on the way back to the airport (stayed on South side of the island). I would recommend this attraction if you happened to be on road-1139 or in the vicinity (e.g., visiting Loveland, or hiking trails nearby. There are plenty of nicer things to see and do on the island but it’s worth a look/see, if you’re in the “neighborhood.” My wife got a kick out of it, using the water bottle, as previously advised by another post. I was less than thrilled and found the art along the road and cafes to be more interesting around the mid-way point of the attraction."
fun trip . a must,"excellent, very interesting road. not sure if your coming or going, a lot of fun to try to figure out. great roadside amenities. "
Atypical road,Very atypical road. Strange to understand. Please take a bottle of water with you to see the mystery in action :) but do not spend more than 15 minutes here
Interesting,It's all about the magic of eye sights. You really thought you see the car going uphill effortlessly
Intrigueing,"It's an optical illusion where the road appears to slopes downhill when in fact, it slopes uphill. You will need to try it with a bottle on its side to understand. It is impossible to describe but the experience will warrant it."
what??? it really is true,"amazing and unbelievable, but true. was the most extraordinary thing I have seen in a long time. makes you rub your eyes to ensure you seeing what you seeing"
A place to remember,"It was great to see the vehicle moving while turned off. I recommend whoever visiting this place to read the scientific explanation to add a benefit to enjoyment. On the other hand, I was told that there are other mysterious roads in other countries that make the cars move faster and harder. If it is near to a place you're already going then I think you should have a look, it won't take much time."
Nothing really special,"Our car machine was turned off by our driver and then it slowly moved on. I don't really get why this was recommended by our driver. I had this kind of experience in other country before, so I felt there was nothing really special for it. And it is not that mysterious after all, it has an explanation behind it.. But if you had never tried a similar experience, maybe it is okay to give it a try. "
yes it was a mysterious hahahahaa,Actually the road has a huge magnet inside well we do not know is it natural or human does it....still mysterious....but we had the sensation when the engine stopped the car is moving
What is this sorcery? ,"It's amazing how illusion can make an up slope looking road,in actual fact downward sloped. Try it out with a water bottle and watch it roll up hill! "
Cutesy and magical feel at Jeju Mysterious Road,We were asked to put our car in neutral gear and be amazed! The road appeared to be flat but what transpired next had us in transfixed.We were figuring out the science behind it.It was all over quickly but was fun while it lasted......just like a magic show!
Jaw dropping phenomenon,We drove around Jeju and decided to give this thing a go cos we didn't believe it would be possible. So we reached the road and there were signs that told you that its the starting. So all you have to do is to put your car in neutral gear and release the accelerator at the starting point and watch your friend's jaw drop. Recommended to visit together with Jeju Loveland as its just 3 minutes driave away. Admission at 8000 won per pax. pricey but its a pretty interesting visit XD
Visit,Good experience. Pull over your car once arrived in the road and enjoy the experience.  On your way to loveland you will pasd over the road. 
Interesting Phenomenon,"Our tour guide built up anticipation of this phenomenon hours before we arrived at the site, and by then, our entire bus load of tourists were completely curious as to what we would experience.It was all over in less than a minute, but still interesting to see how a natural illusion could occur if the conditions are right.It's not worth making the effort just to see this short stretch of road, but if you happen to be in the vicinity, by all means see if the illusion works on you!"
Interesting strip of road,"What is so mysterious about this road is that vehicles can still move upslope with the engine switched off. We had the engine of the bus switched off and experienced it first hand what it felt like. The bus was first moving at a very slow speed but it started to gear up towards the end of the road. We then got off the bus to watch other vehicle move on the road. It was quite an interesting sight. Somewhere nearby, I even saw a stand giving out free Christian literature. Lots of snacks available. My first time trying the milk. At first, I thought it was some yoghurt drink or a big bottle of Yakult. Tried the one with black cap and realised that it's banana milk. I never like flavoured milk but this taste nice.More pictures available onhttp://i-wanna-travel.blogspot.sg/2015/03/korea-jeju-17-mar-2014.html"
Jeju....visit!,"Our first visit to this magical island. Such a beautiful place, weather was great, people were friendly. Hope to return."
Disbelievers will be Converted - Must Experience the Mystery,"Your Eyes will tell you one thing. Your experience will tell you another. All in less than 10 minutes.An this is not part of 'Alive' or 'Trick Art Museum'.Although this peculiar stretch of road in Jeju is only about 100 metres long, it really does draw in the crowds. I arrived there as a skeptic. My wife have read the brochures and blogs about that place. But I was persuaded to be there. Following the instructions:1. drive car to start point, indicated by a stone pillar on the side of the road.2. engage Neutral Gear3. switch off engine4. disengage all brakes (foot and hand brakes)5. sit and relax as you feel your car roll UPHILL!Outside you you will see tour-leaders and other disbelievers coming out with all kinds of theories and proofs. They have their ""spirit-levels"" (as contactors carry) and cans of soft drinks to, without external force, roll uphill.All this in 5-10 mins. Figure out HOW for yourself."
