Attractive park area initially created for an Expo.,"It's not too easy to get to but if you like landscaped gardens it's worth the effort. It's an area of land by a river split down the middle with a roadway. One side of the road are large very attractive landscaped gardens, the other side forests of various types of trees. Along the road centre there are buildings used for exhibitions and plazas, when we were there speed skaters were practising. There is an attractive Expo bridge across the river and the rivers opposite bank features impressive buildings also created for 1993 World Expo."
Nice and Clean Park,"The park is very nice and a wide area. You don't have to pay anything, it's free. There are also some traditional Korean gazebo to relax. This place is also near Daejeon Expo Plaza with its fun fountain for kids to play around in summer."
Nice place at Daejeon,"A very nice place, a lot of flowers, i visited at the Fall, so, the colour of the leaves are the best of my visit."
"Lovely, lovely. Relax and enjoy.",I was staying here for a conference. And near Daejeon Conference Center you can find this lovely garden. It is free to visit and offers some great views over the gardens and Daejeon city. A visit is really recommended And it is free!
Beautiful landscaping-my favorite sight in Daejeon,"This park is attractive and not too far away from a metro stop. It offers several trails and although it is small, you will end up spending a lot of time wandering around the various trails. There are several different areas of the park and it is great for beautiful pictures as well. It is free to visit."
Wonderful walking environment,"I was there on a June Saturday morning. Lovely and interesting vegetation of many types, very quiet, despite the hundreds of other people (and lots of kids) around. Would be even more beautiful in the spring, and maybe in the fall"
Nice quiet place,"Not the best gardens I’ve ever been to, However nice peaceful and relaxing. Good place to bring your family, and have a nice picnic"
The location is perfect,"I like thus place because the location is close to the downtown (Dunsan area) and expo park. If your hobby is jogging, i believe you will like this place"
Best place to taking a walk!,"I live in Daejeon over 20yrs. In my opinion, this is the best place to taking a walk with your families. Nice environment. You can park your car in front of the Nammun Park or art museum etc. "
Take a rest from the city life,"There are a lot of Korean plants that are cultivated by gardeners. Perhaps you can take a rest from the city life. I sometimes go to the Hanbat Arboretum after work on Fridays. It has satisfying paths with various plants, so I rest or take a walk there. It has gorgeous views during each of Korea’s four distinct season."
Perfect Picnic Place,"On a warm sunny day, I took the bus here and had a wonderful time. Don't miss the tropical garden before heading to the glorious East and West wings of the arboretum. There are several benches and tables spread throughtout several paths. Many of the signs are in English (although the entrance map was not). This a visitors booth to collect an English map of the entire scene. In between the two ""wings"" there is a playground and biking area. Rent a bike and have a ""gay ol' time"". I brought a blanket and food; i joined families beneath the shade of several trees to eat and nap. I plan to visit again this summer or fall."
Hints on this place,"1) I recommend you to spend in this area whole day, because Arboretum is quite big and interesting, and there are several museums not far. It surely deserves whole day!2) Open hours 6AM–9PM (april–september), 8AM–7PM (october-march). Free admission.3) Infrastructure is well developed. There are small library, forest class, lot of thematical gardens, pond, gazebos etc.4) Don't forgt to visit tropicl garden! it's situated in stand alone building and you may think, that it's not a territity of Arboretum."
Probably better in Spring,I was unfortunate enough to go when all the plants were still dead. However I still enjoyed walking around. The EXPO bridge is right by it which you can use to access the EXPO park
Beautiful park,"Beautiful park, can rent a bike or walk, in the middle of the city. Subway line 1 ends near the park"
Still plenty of colour in mid November,Take a warm jacket and gloves now it has turned colder and if vsiting it in the winter. Also visited here in 2014 but that was in the hot summer. Don't feed the fish and no littering and make sure you take plenty of water and a brolly for shade in the summer months.
"Hanbat Arboretum, 11 and 13 Oct'16","October, 2016. I went to this beautiful place on the banks of theGapcheong river, which is a breath of fresh air. the placeabounds in trees, plants, and flowers all around, withpavilions, resting places and even a small pond, right there. On11 October, the Western side was closed, though both sides wereopen on 13 October. I was in a bit of a time crunch, and hencewas not able to explore the Western side of the Arboretum.Hanbat is the old name of the town of Daejeon. The HanbatArboretum extends right from the impressive Expo bridge with itsunique design, to a cycling track and exposition center, at the center,with a road separating the place from the Government Complex. Oneextremely impressive part of the Arboretum is the Tropical area,which has a wonderful collection of plants, right from floweringplants, to the trees, found in the tropics. It even has a small waterfall!"
Scenic piece of fresh air in easy reach from the metro line,"I spent an afternoon wandering around here - it's fairly large but quite accessible to anyone with wheelchairs or strollers. A great place to picnic, rent bikes or 4-person family pedallers, sit and watch the enormous outdoor big-screen (it was playing some animation movies at the time I visited). There's a lovely lake filled with koi and waterlillies too. "
"Wonderful Gardens, great afternoon spent.",Beautiful place to wonder and explore. Perfect afternoon out. Photographers paradise. Peaceful and packed with great views and beauty to view and appreciate.Wish I could have spent a larger amount of time there. Easily could spend hours on end slowly wandering around and experiencing all the park contains. Great to see if enjoyed by people of all ages and all walks of life. We bumped into many school groups enjoying the park on school trips.
Arboretum was great but the gardens are a must see,Beautiful gardens and walks. Highly recommend. Has a great recreation area too. Should plan to spend at least two hours to be able to enjoy the facility. You can take your time as you walk through gardens and trails. And there is no charge.
Hanbat and its gardens: wonderful!,"It's important to point out that the arboretum is just a small part of a huge recreational area that includes - the river walk, gardens, several museums, exhibition area, bridge, and expo park. You can spend days visiting the entire area, or just a day in the gardens and indoor arboretum. In summer have bug repellent. The area is all free, except the museums and easy to get to by bus or subway. You will enjoy many different plants, waterfalls, and giant trees in the arboretum. In the gardens outside there are bridges, marshes, pavilions and a small hill as a lookout. A great date place, I'd imagine. Or for family or school outings. A welcome reprieve from city life. "
Nice place to hangout with friends and family!,"As the name suggest, it is a botanical garden. So, you can visit if you love nature, plants and serene environment. Besides, Mugunghwa garden, autumn foliage forest, queritron forest, pine tree forest, eco forest, coniferous forests, forest of meditation, garden of senses, wetland garden, willow tree forest, grass plaza, outdoor learning center are the main attractions."
Beautiful,This a beautiful place. It has so many areas which can offer peace and reflection as well as parks and attractions to bring the family. It was definitely worth it.
Very nice place for nature lovers,"I recommend this place to be visited by all the nature lovers, especially for european people, because there are a lot of beautiful trees, different than european ones. Very beautiful!"
A relaxing place to spend the day,"In spring and early summer the arboretum is unbeatable. The well-laid out walk-ways, landscape, and ponds are very inviting and beautiful. Amazing flowers and shrubbery offer a pleasing escape from the congestion of the city. Bike rentals and other attractions for children offer something for family entertainment. The nearby river and foot bridge open up the recreational possibilities measurably. Bring a mat and picnic lunch to extend your stay. For the best experience avoid weekends in the summer and Korean holidays, as it becomes very crowded. The park is free as is parking. Good family bargain."
I'm sure it's lovely in the spring,"I went to the Hanbat Arboretum during the winter, which was obviously not the season to go but happened to be when I was available. Still, even though the trees were mostly barren, the layout and convenience of the park were great. I liked the high-up spot from which you could see Daejeon's skyline, and each major sight you could see from there was labeled on a picture just below. There are plenty of wide-open areas and photo opportunities, and everything's located quite close to everything else here. I had fun and explored this place for two or so hours before leaving with a pretty good taste in my mouth of it. Best of all, it's free!I'm sure it's beautiful during spring, summer, or fall!"
Large garden,"If you are into nature reserve sort in immediate vicinity, this is it.Right smack in the middle of the city, the garden has East and West wings. Both have ponds and streams littered with pathways that takes you through variety of trees and shrubs and if right time of the year lots of flowers.You'll see many couples and familiar taking leisurely stroll.You have access to art centers and a major river, too!"
Lovely Park,"Lovely park to walk, cycle or picnic. The place has different trees and gardens that suitable for all seasons. We were having picnic in the summer and just re-visited today for nice autumn walk. Unfortunately we were a bit late so the maple trees were nearly out of leaves but still very plesant. Definitely good for family outing."
wonderful place,it is a wonderful place to family. every weekend many citizens visit to this park. enterance is free..
Hanbat worth a look,Nice way to spend an hour. All trees are named and lovely tidy gardens. Easy to access and down by the river which is good for walking.
Peaceful park in Daejeon,"Korea’s largest inner city artificial arboretum, the Hanbat Arboretum Park, located in Dunsan-daero (Seo-gu district) is particularly beautiful during Spring and Fall and a great place to admire Korea’s flora. The Park is separated in two halves – the East and West Gardens – and consists of about 20 individually-themed gardens including the Magnolia Garden, Rose Garden, Medicinal Garden, Forest for Meditation, Rock Garden and the Fruit Tree Garden. The area in between and the surrounding areas are usually place for outdoor activities such as biking, movie projection, concerts and festivals. The park is located across the Expo Park (easily reached through the Expo Bridge, and close to the Museum of Art of Daejeon.Free admission.Find out other points of interest in Daejeon in:http://www.loosetranslations.com/things-to-do-in-Daejeon/"
"Peaceful, beautiful gardens ","The paths and landscape were inviting, and there was a diversity of plants and birds. The west gardens are closed on Tuesdays, so I didn't get to look through them (the east gardens are closed on Mondays), but I still thought it was worth the trip. Since the growing season is coming to an end some of the plants were starting to die back, but the visit was still overall very pleasant. If I'm ever in Daejeon again, especially in the spring, I will go again. "
No 1 place to visit in Daejeon.,"This is the place to visit in Daejeon. The arboretum is divided into 2 parts and the one is as beautiful as the other. There is a big lake. They have planted flower beds as well as wild flowers growing with some forest trees as well. Ideal for photographers, people with children, couples and older people. It is a bit dreary during winter but the lake area is still beautiful."
Good venue for a relaxing picnic,"A huge park with different areas, including routes for bikes, which can be hired, skaters etc. Wide open spaces with trees and shaded gazebos, where you can sit and soak up the sun or picnic. "
A relaxing family outing,"The arboretum is a nice size with a variety of things to see and do. It's not a thrilling tourist attaction, but a nice place to go for a picnic. There are, of course, lots of different kinds of flowers, a tropical greenhouse, and walking paths. My two girls love the large pond filled with koi. You can sit in a pagodo and see them. Lots of people brings breadcrumbs, etc to feed the fish. There is also a nice playground with a grassy area perfect for a picnic. Next to the playground you can rent family bikes to ride around the bike area. In the summer, there's also a fountain that the kids love to play in.Overall, a nice place for a relaxing family outing. There's a decent-sized parking lot, and if you go in the early morning (around 10) there are plenty of places to park, but as the day wears on the parking lot gets packed."
Overrated...,"I don't see why people say this was an interesting place to visit. Nothing is described in English so it was just looking at plants and their names, but the descriptions were unreadable (Korean). It was free so at least I didn't have to spend any money to see it. Good way to kill time I guess."
Awesome complex of fun!!!,"the arboretum itself is quite large and beautiful with lots of themed gardens as well as open space, splash pad, bike rental and riding area, playground, Cafe, convenient store, greenhouse and many special events happening on weekends. Additionally right next to it are 2 art museums (small but nice) and a performing arts centre with the river and its walking/biking path right behind it. Something for everyone!!"
good for promenade and relaxing,"This park is near Daejeon Expo land so that I could visit 2 tourism attractions at a day.There are lots of colourful leaves all the trees when I visit here. I really liked to take photos with those. Along the path, some people were relaxing while looking around the park. I did regret that I didn't visit the tropical bortanic garden. I heard it is closed at 17:00.If you need a walk to recharge yourself, I would recommend you to visit!"
A must-visit park especially during autumn,"My friends and I visited Hanbat Arboretum during autumn so the leaves are in their most colorful and prettiest state (i think). Hanbat is a very spacious park where you can leisurely spend time and have picnic with your friends and family. The view is so fascinating. Also, it is near the Expo Park and Daejeon Art Center. Above all, there is NO ENTRANCE FEE. So, ENJOY! :)"
