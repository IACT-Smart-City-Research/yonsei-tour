A nice walk over the city,"A pleasant walk over the the hustle of the city. Markets are sometimes held as at the weekend. It has a nice view of Seoul station, especially if you want to watch the sunset over the city. Its also nicely lit after dark. Usually a few people walking about and taking photos, but never feels to busy."
A Garden in the Air,"Like the New York Highline, this old roadway has been rebirthed as an above street garden walkway. As you proceed along, the vistas open out into a wide expansive view around Seoul station. If you’re lucky someone, maybe you, will be playing one of the several upright pianos stationed along the walkway. The gardens change as you walk through a range of plant species."
Nice outdoor space in an otherwise very urban city ,It’s a bit like the NY Highline except more concrete. Nice way to get between areas of the city and avoid the traffic. 
Seoulo highline,"A bit like the NY highline, this is an urban walkway created from a disused rail line that allows you to walk through the downtown area of Seoul unimpeded by traffic. What a simple but brilliant idea; I hope more cities copy it. There are pleasant features there (like a piano) to break the journey, it's a pleasant stroll you can pick up near Seoul station."
An Airborne Oasis,"Take the walk at night. The soft glow of the planters and occasional music along the way are good for the soul, an airborne oasis above the rush of cars and trains. During the days you may come across a player at one of the four or so pianos along the route. And the blooms are changing every week. Even umbrellas are provided for an oppressive summer sun. Thoughtful Korean designers at their best. Highly recommended."
Overhead garden bridge,"It's an urban garden that's above the roads. You get a good view of Seoul Station (both old and new). If you're trainspotter, you can look at trains coming in and out of Seoul Station"
Great that Seoul followed Manhattan and converted this elevated highway section!,"The walkway is not very long but nice, with interesting trees and many pianos, plus a few interesting views."
Wonderful little walk,"A quirky elevated garden built on an overpass above the busy Seoul streets. They provide free umbrellas to borrow whilst enjoying the walk and protect yourself from the sun. There are plenty of different varieties of plants, a nice area where mist is sprayed to keep cool (plants and tourists alike) and was overall a nice place to visit without crowds to bother you."
"Whimsical, Botanical and No Traffic Lights","We were attracted by the lights at first, around midnight near our hotel in Seoul station. Taking those lighted stairs revealed at first a nice potted garden with each pot labeled with the latin botanical name for each plant. As we continued our walk, we found more than plants - it was a whimsical park, with working pianos, an embassy for an alien planet (where you can take official pictures behind the alien flag), trampolines, kids' drawing station, glass floors, and other rather amusing play areas - all free! Even late at night, the park felt safe - there are people walking through even after midnight. Also, the uniformed park keepers are still around late, with lighted red candlesticks in hand. This is an enjoyable place to walk, and it is most convenient when going from Seoul Station to Namdaemum or the Hoehyeon Station. Skip the traffic and take a walk in Seoullo - it will bring a smile to your heart!"
"Skip DDP, go here","It is probably the most beautiful walk to take in the night. The old Seoul Railway station is in lit up and so is the new one, not to mention the sky walkway. It is such a wonderful place to wander. Simply go!"
Nice Elevated Walkway,"This was an elevated walkway that was more than just glass, metal and concrete. Everywhere planter boxes were filled with different types of trees, flowers and plants. All labeled in both Korean and Latin and some in bloom. It made the walk more pleasant getting to Seoul Square especially not having to wait for crosswalk signals or traffic.A number of brightly colored pianos were randomly located and anyone could sit down and play a tune. There also were some type of carts painted with animal characters that I assumed could be used to wheel your kiddies around.The walkway was easily accessible through any number of stairs, elevators or ramps thus making it a convenient way of getting around the area."
Our Mini Family Spring 2019,Seollal was my wishlist back in 2017 but only managed visit it this year.It was just infront of our 2nd homestay and at the back of Namdaemun gate 5.It was nice walking along the seollal with plants along with it and since it was cold during our visit we decided to have early lunch at the seolla building (dont remember the name) The building serve mostly for eateries.That time there was a marine exhibition being held.
Passing by sightseeing,Calling this an overhead bridge would be a severe understatement! There are tons of plants here with their scientific names and korean names. The view of the city at night wasnt so bad. There are pianos for ppl to use if they wish. The signages are all projected onto the floor which is quite cool. I went in the late evening though it seems like there are afew small activities for people to partake it for a small fee if theg wish but they were all closed when i went. Plenty of ambassadors and security walking around the area.Its lovely but i wouldnt go out of my way to visit it. Only if its nearby or along the way.
Great views and greenery in the bustling Seoul,"I just came back from Seoullo7017 - visited it on Sunday. I found it so calming and relaxing to walk around on this bridge high above the streets. It provides a leisurely walk connecting a few places. It is nicely decorated with pianos and plants adding a nice contrast to the streets around. I went during the day, but would love to come back in the evening to take some different shots. Worth a visit, for sure. Right by Seoul Station, so very easy to get to. There are stairs, as well as Ann escalator and elevators for those who with limited mobility or on wheelchairs. "
Fantastic view ,It’s a great opportunity to walk above the busy traffic and admire the city life in Seoul. No traffic lights at all.
Spring soon..,"all the plants are either leafless or covered because it still seems like winter here even though it's already end of March. but i did not regret coming here, we really can see the great effort to revitalise the city with fresh looks while letting visitors to experience the bustling city without to worry about the traffic."
Offers A Different Perspective,"This wide, elevated walkway -- about 56-feet-high -- runs for 1 kilometer between Malli-dong and Namdaemun Market. The pedestrian green space opened in 2017, replacing a highway overpass that originated in 1970. I've strolled along the two similar walkways that exist worldwide, the High Line in New York City and the Promenade Plantee in Paris, and was curious about how this one would compare. So on a recent visit to Seoul, I picked up a brochure about the attraction at the Information office, about where Seoullo 7017 begins by the market's Gate 5. Here, the walkway is like a ramp, slowly rising to the full height. Along the stretch, I also noted five elevators and one escalator.I liked the opportunity to amble with few pedestrians to dodge, looking at buildings and vehicular traffic from a different perspective than what occurs at ground level. Cafes and at least one place to buy snacks beckoned on this early Sunday morning, and myriad plants thrived in a variety of pots along with young trees. The brochure offered an introduction to the greenery that can be seen here, but the growth still has a way to go to compete with New York City and Paris. There is also much more concrete here and the distance is shorter than the other two.It took about 15 minutes to walk to an elevator that descends to Seoul Station Square. But it does not lead directly into the station.Seoullo 7017 appealed to me for a one-time visit. But it did not entice me to return, which happened with the High Line and Promenade Plantee."
Calmness over the hectic korean lifestyle,"Well, personally I liked this place although many people said this place is not as good as they thought. Just my timing was not good. I visited this place during the Winter over a bad pollution.Surrounded by high buildings,I could imagine visiting this walkpath during the sunset on the Spring with a good weather should become a great view. I can feel the calmness over the hectic korean lifestyle"
Innovation the Seoul way,"Great innovation and urban revitalisation. Use it to walk quickly from Seoul Station to Namdaemun. Along the way, lots for the eye to see, including those cute tortoises that tricked me into thinking they were statues. Really quirky and one of those reasons, Seoul just keeps on giving as a growing exciting destination."
Beautiful at night time,Not too long of a walk but very enjoyable! I love the setup especially the variety of trees and plants. Pack an umbrella in case it rains. 
Pleasant place,Walked along seoullo from seoul station to Namdaemun market. Pleasant walk on seoullo looking at buildings and there’s even coffee shop along seoullo. Nice place to take a walk and enjoy seoul. Elevators are available for strollers and wheelchair
Pretty walk near sunset ,"We decided to visit this park around sunset: various plantings and street pianos are scattered about, plus some tiny coffee shops and some stores. It’s about .5-6 mile ?, inspired by what NYC did in the Highline Park, which we happened to see 4 months ago."
Shorter than I expected,"Seoullo 7017 was quite nice once you get up. There's an elevator or you can wind your way up the stairs and get some exercise. There's not much to see except the rail and buildings but it's a nice way to cross the road and offers a great place to sit along with all the trees and ponds up here. There's quite an evident homeless scene underneath as many older Koreans sit by Seoul station but they won't bother you. While here, walk to Lotte Mart which is nearby for an interesting experience in a Korean supermarket."
Honestly not worth it,"It’s a knock off attempt at the high line, except there is no design philosophy whatsoever. No effort made to make the motifs work with each other. Just ugly cement pots with flowers on a bridge"
OLD ELEVATED ROAD CONVERTED INTO A PEDESTRIAN WALK WAY,"It was around 1970 when this elevated road was constructed to connect two sides around Seoul Station. However due to safety issues, the road was closed.After this, rather than tearing down the existing structure, the road was developed into Seoullo 7017, an elevated garden for pedestrians.I visited last April and May during spring time and the trees were in their prime conditions. The walk way is like the condensed version of the Korean forest and flora.I recommend to schedule a visit at around 5 pm until sundown as the views are amazing with the changing sky colors and the sun rays are not too harsh on these times.There is a convenience store in the middle part of the walk way with a viewing deck at the top for better views."
Lovely at christmas,"i was living in Namdaemun so every time i would take the subway or need to do laundry i would have to cross Seoullo and it was always lovely at Christmas they decorate the park and little activity areas, there is also a cafe and lift down to exit 8 of Seoul station"
Great walk,"We discovered this by accident one evening when we decided to walk from Namdaemun market to Seoul station. The flowers are great and when lit up at night with the soft breeze, it is a fantastic walk with views over parts of the city."
Quite nice but short,"This is a welcome walk that now allows to leisurely cross the busy station square. This elevated « green » walk is actually not that green despite the numerous plants that have been planted in concrete structures, but still much much better than anything grey and polluted below. Its was probably difficult to do much better in such environment. It is also a good opportunity to review your botanical skills as all plants there have a label (in Korean but with Latin names). The most disappointing is the length of this walk, maybe 1 km or so, meaning that you cross it in 15 minutes."
"For a different view of Seoul, visit the Seoullo 7017 'skyline'","Recently opened and featuring all manner of interactive elements in addition to great views of this ever-changing city, Seoullo 7017 is an easy journey on-foot through green spaces that have been built on an old freeway ramp. Leading the visitor from nearby the Namdaemun Market to Seoul Station (or vice-versa), the best time to visit is dusk as the park is lit-up by coloured LEDs, entire building sides are illuminated by animated video displays and the city is bathed in a golden light as the sun sets. Seoul Station offers a small number of eateries as well as discount shopping, but anticipate some homeless people waiting out the day in its shadow."
The best part of Seoul!,"A must do! A long walk bridge, so uniquely done. Lovely plantations all along, colourful flowers! Steps and elevators at short distances for you to get off at various locations along the way. Equally stunning at night. Good promenade!"
Great for a break,"You can sign up for a free guided walking tour 3 days in advance through the official Visit Seoul website, but i found that it's perfectly satisfactory just walking and relaxing. The view is also pretty nice, you can see the moving traffic and buildings in the distance from above. There are multiple beautifully painted pianos which you can play on. All the plants have name tags including the korean and the scientific name. They are in alphabetical order and provide QR codes to access information about them."
Excellent place for a pause,Go here for a relaxing walk in the city. Green and no cars. Some spots with nice view. We had a coffee break between shopping and sightseeing. 
"Fun, romantic, nice-looking, and clean","It’s a new highline with a nice skyline of the city, with free high-quality pianos standing around, cold water pool to cool your feet, and lots of flowers and trees. It’s well-designed and can be a romantic spot, but also perfect for families and friends. Definitely worth checking out!"
Atmospheric at night,"When I was in Seoul last year, Seoullo was not yet open to the public. So I went to check it out this time. I went in the late evening on a weekday. There were few visitors. The elevated walkway was lit up in blue LED light and was atmospheric. You could get a good view of Seoul Station, the flashing animated light designs on a building in front of the station, and the busy traffic on the thoroughfares down below. Outside one of the pavilions, there are display panels with a time lapse video on the development of the walkway (project designed by the Dutch team MVRDV).Would go again next time in Seoul during the day to enjoy the space. "
An amazing experience on top of the chaos,"Visiting this space above the chaos that surrounds Seoul Station is pure magic: the nature taking over the city and the way this walk to the market and the station has been created is the perfect spot to visit, not only for architects or architecture lovers, but also to appreciate Seoul in a different way."
Relaxing walkway,"This is a.new tourist attraction in the center of Seoul. It used to be an overpass for the motorists but the city govt converted it to a.new pedestrian overpass.Seoullo17 stretches from namdaemun market in hoehyon station up to Malla-dong. I started my walk in the hoehyon side where the tourist information was located. Since it used to be a bridge, the walk uphill was a.breeze. This overpass.was connected to 2 buildings.where the cafes and restaurants including the comfort rooms.are located. At the center of the overpass, you will have a commanding view of seoul station and the sorrounding areas. The place has alot of benches, and plant boxes. Since it was early spring, the plants have not bloomed yet, in fact they are just starting to.plant flowering plants.This overpass had several exits with elevators. One can easily go to seoul station and the seoul bus transport center.This place is good for walking during spring and autumn but i.doubt during summer and rainy season. "
Very relaxing walk,I came here during the evening and was able to see the scenery at day and at night as well. This is a favourite spot for both locals and tourists as you are surrounded by well-maintained plants and on top of bustling roads that crosses Seoul Station as well. Will come here again! 
Seoullo - an elevated pedestrian walkway from Seoul station to Namdemun market.,"A newly renovated old viaduct for vehicles turned into a pedestrian walkway. It was completed n opened in July 2017.The former vehicle viaduct was deemed unsafe n too expensive to repair for vehicle use. It was converted to a pedestrian walkway. It begins at Seoul station opposite the Lotte Mart n ends at Namdemun Market gate 6.It is illuminated in blue led lights from 7.15pm onwards. Quite a sight to enjoy. Very convenient to walk with escalators and elevators at various points. Cafes, tourist info center n patrolling security personnel are on hand to to provide you with assistance.A must place to visit n enjoy."
Seoullo 7017 Garden is Serenity in the City,"Seoullo 7017 Sky Garden is the latest landmark that has been added to the bevy of attractive tourists’ sites in Seoul City. I visited a couple of months after it's opening in 2017 and it was as serene as I could imagine.The plants and flowers were green and offered a space to relax, especially if you want to read or sip on your coffee. The views on the highways under the Sky Walkway is also amazing. There are souvenir shops and coffee shops lined on the monument. It is also easier to reach Namdaemun market and Namsan Park. The night views with all the lights are enchanting."
A Unique Place in Seoul.,"Seoul 7017 is an old highway that has been converted into a walking bridge with lots of attractions and nature. Right next to Seoul Station, Seoullo 7017 is very central and provides a nice break from the constant city on all sides. However, I think that you probably can't spend more than an hour or two here."
ok but overpriced,"Good idea, kinda ok execution, the plants are pretty, but it's way too short and the f&b facilities are overpriced. Just go eat at Namdaemun market if you go there!"
Amazing Bridge!!!,It's a very beautiful attraction place in Seoul because so many flowers and trees along the walk away. It was very relaxing to walk in this place. This place will be nice to shoot buildings and railways in Seoul
take a stroll,as you can see from other reviews this attraction will not amaze you. It's the place for those that like to walk and take in the view. If you are in the mood for a stroll it offers a nice view of downtown Seoul and if the weather is nice can be a good spot to enjoy the sunset. We walked from the Seoul Station down to Namdaemun market.
Overhead Bridge,"If your country have a overhead bridge, then no point visiting this place. It is simply a decorated overhead bridge with top down city views"
I was there sun setting,I was in Seoul in Dec and it was very cold. I walked on the bridge Seoullo 7017 from Seoul Station. Sun was setting.
A Showcase of Korean Urban Regeneration,"Seoullo 7017 used to be an elevated flyover near the Seoul Train Station before it was converted into a pedestrian sky garden in 2017. Visited in mid-January when the temperature plunged to a few degrees Celsius. We were there for a walk after our dinner. It was very relaxing to walk in the park. We were there during Winter, thus there were no plants or trees along the sky garden but it could be seen what supposed to be areas where trees and plants will grow during other seasons of the year.There was a Light Festival during Winter to compensate the lack of plants, I suppose. The Light Festival was beautiful showing pieces of lights art. The pedestrian bridge also offer a nice view of the surrounding bustling urban area.Would recommend if you like to enjoy urban parks and appreciate urban infrastructure/buildings, generally urbanisation."
Pedestrian bridge,"We're visiting Seoullo on our winter trip and we loved the view from the top. By walking through Seoul Station exit 2, we reached this new landmark. It was near the old building of Seoul Station. It was very windy and the temperature was about - 13 celcius, but still we enjoyed to be there.  If you like to walk along, there are three routes that you can choose. Along this bridge, there are some cafés and information center. "
New landmark ,"When Seoullo is all lit up in blue, it looks magical. Since it is facing west and high up, it can also be a good spot for sunset photo. I was there last August when the walkway was newly opened. The city offered free walking tour in the evening. It was interesting. From Seoullo, we walked to Namsan Park and down to Namdaemun. The whole tour was about 1.5 - 2 hours. "
Nice Pedestrian Bridge to Walk Along,"It's a very new attraction place in Seoul. There are many trees & flowers along the walk way. you can start it around Namdaemun Market or Seoul Station. There are some connecting paths to the major buildings. If you would like to visit in the morning, please come around 07:30 or 08:00 am. If you come later, it's very hot. But if you would like to find sme coffee/ snacks/ food to eat, the shops there will open around 10:30 - 11:00 am. For me, I love to visit at night time (after 19:30 pm.) to see some beautiful lights."
Another Linkway,"I was looking forward to this, to see the hype that surrounded this. To my dismay, it is like another linkway above the busy roads of Seoul Station. I guess it would be best to see during Spring where the trees and flowers are in full bloom. The stems of plants are bare as its winter now. What i do like is that there are speakers with sounds of nature being fed in. "
 A pedestrian bridge with a view,"This is a alleviated pedestrian bridge with broad walkway and benches. Beside linking the shopping Mall and the popular Lotte Outlets and Lotte Mart to Seoul Station, this bridge gives a good overview of the roads and surrounding buildings. My family chances upon this pedestrian bridge and was impressed with the place. At that time the sun was just setting and we could have a beautiful sight of the setting sun. "
New attraction,"If you want to see Seoul at night, you can visit this place.Theres a walking tour you can avail for free."
"Pretty empty, better to visit at night","Seoullo 2017 is directly connected to Seoul Station. There wasn't much stuff to see in the day, so I'd recommend to visit at night when the walkway is lit up."
Fun experience,"Rather like the Highline in New York City, this is a derelict flyover that's been converted into a modern, fun place to stroll above the city traffic. Lots of places to sit and people watch, amongst the trees, lotus ponds, shrubs and look out points. Free to wander and well worth the climb."
Casual stroll for a cool night,Best done with a tour guide that you can book for free on iTour Seoul website. The guide will give you a background as to how the pedestrian walk came about and lead you through a pleasant walk around the area. The blue lights are nice to be caption camera. If you're into horticulture you'll also find various plants along the way. My highlight of the evening was chatting with our guide.
Better in the evening,"Nice skywalk near Seoul Station. Very rare walk-through in Seoul. The view around is also cool.- There's an illumination in the evening. So, it's better to go late if you wish to feel romantic. During summer, it's too hot during the daytime.- There are various plants with names on them. Not that interesting, though. Good for kids' studies. I think family with children will have more fun with a few attractions.- Unfortunately, souvenir shops aren't selling rare stuffs. Few people are interested.- There's an elevator on downhill to the Namdaemun Gate. N Seoul Tower-Baekbeom Park-Seoullo 7017-Seoul Station route by walk is recommended."
Seoullo 7017 Review,"It is an interesting and creative idea to develop a pedestrian like this. But, in my opinion, around Seoullo 7017 needs to be developed both for visitors of the city and the citizens."
Nice city walk ,"Gives you a good look and feel of the city, while still being perfectly safe. It's a disused road that's turned into an urban walkway. Nice nature and peaceful to sit. Extends from myeongdong to seoul station "
Great place for a beautiful photo spot,Love this place so much. I started my walk from the Seoul Station (exit at the Airport Rail). Really loved the views from the walkway at night. Don't forget to also detour right after the Seoullo Terrace (towards the Hilton and Seven Lucky Casino) and you will be at the part of the city wall. Very beautiful location from up there. You can see the Namsan Tower and skyline.Really recommended.
Beautiful walk at night,"On a nice night, the walk from one end to the other is fabulous. We had a hard time finding the entrance in the dark, but it was worth it. It was beautifully lit and we very much enjoyed the views of the city at night."
