A baseball game in Korea is a must experience in a trip to South Korea,"Jamsil is so easy to get to on the subway. The crowd is just phenomenal - you spend half your time watching the game, the other half watching the fans!Oh, and did I mention cheap beer?"
First timer,"First time catching a baseball game live. Atmosphere is electrifying, and seated at the exciting zone adds another level of fun. Ushers are friendly and directions to seats, washroom etc are clear enough for us.Go go Doosan Bear!"
Great venue!,"Headed up to Seoul to see a baseball game. Really easy to get to, subway right at the stadium. Pretty good venue, great facilities and easy to get around. Fantastic game and atmosphere with the ground. Had a really fun night, recommend getting here to see a local game if you can."
The game is secondary to the experience,"Watching baseball in Korea is more about people watching. The Koreans are very into their teams and their players. Each player has his own 'signature' song and when he comes to bat EVER fan of that team sings that batter's song. The singing is led by a head cheerleader (male) and five to six 'go go girl' cheerleaders. Each team has their own set of cheerleaders so make sure you get seats (which are cheap) to watch both sides of the field.You can bring in all the food and/or beverages you want. But there are dozens of places to eat and drink in the stadium as well. They have beer vendors who cruise the aisles with backpack dispensers of beer and they just refill your cups for about $5.The fried chicken, no matter which vendor, is always good.Oh, the game??? It is about AAA level in the states. Each team has at least one American who is either a pitcher or a power hitter.All in all, a MUST experience if you visit Seoul. There are games every day of the week except Mondays throughout the season."
Must do on your trip to Seoul!,"The stadium wasn’t even close to full on our Thursday night baseball game but the atmosphere was amazing! The Koreans love their baseball and honestly, it’s infectious. The cheerleaders are such good fun as is the food and beer culture. It’s also super cheap to go too versus the US."
Great day out ,"Great way to spend a Saturday afternoon! Scorching weather, cheap beer and a lively atmosphere! Perfect day out alone, with friends or with the family."
Not your typical baseball experience and thats a good thing!,"I visited Jamsil stadium in mid-April for a Wednesday night Doosan Bears game. It was just me for the evening so I picked up a single seat along the first base line in the front row. I found the stadium staff to be pleasant and helpful as they guided me to my seat despite me not really understanding anything on my mobile ticket. The seats were quite spacious when compared to seats at American baseball stadiums. You could actually fit between your seat and the seat next to you. Furthermore, there was a multitude of food options including BBQ and all kinds of chicken and meat. There was also a 7 Eleven where you could purchase convenience store items at reasonable prices. It was quite the experience. Both teams fans were very loud during their at-bats and they sang and cheered the whole time. Very passionate. It was quite different from the American baseball experience. In terms of navigation, subway is the best way to get there. It was easy to find despite there being very few people on the subway wearing Doosan Bears gear who I could follow. Getting home at night wasn't bad either. Overall, the atmosphere is electric. The fans engaged and cheering. The food options are tasty and good value. Seats are comfortable. Highly recommend coming here for a game if you're a fan of baseball. Its a whole new experience in all the right ways."
Enthusiastic crowds,"A visit to a baseball game is definitely worthwhile. In our case, it was LG Twins vs. NC Dinos, who were well supported for an away team. In comparison to US baseball games, in our experience the audience is much more lively and consistently cheering on their team. Tickets were available at the stadium on game day, which was possible due to it being a non-rivalry game against an out-of-town opponent. Third-base upper deck tickets were approx $15 each, with good view of the game. Plenty of food and drinks available inside but feel free to bring your own as well. "
Electric Atmosphere!,"We stayed at the InterContinental Grand Seoul Parnas and was a few stops away on the Seoul Metropolitan Subway. Very accessible!Food: I'd recommend grabbing some food before you head to your seats. My friends and I grabbed some fried chicken and beer. Once we grabbed our food, we didn't want to leave. Atmosphere: One of the most electric atmospheres at a sporting event I've ever been to. The home and visiting team take turns cheering them on and it was a sight to behold. I highly recommend watching a game if you're within season and in the area!"
Great Park,"Great experience, enjoy the baseball and the food is awesome with a ton of variety. My first Kprean baseball experience was really cool."
Doosan on Bears Baseball game,No better way to watch a baseball game. I think I spent half my time watching the fans celebrating and cheering their team vs the actual game. Definitely make sure if you are rooting for the home team you let the box office know so you set in that section.only drawback is not being able to get the tickets online but the truth was there was plenty of seating ( I did go on a Wed) so I was able to go to the box office and just buy the ticket an hour before. Great selection of food inside and outside the stadium. Anything you buy outside you can take in. Must do in Korea
Fun Even if You Don’t Like Sports,"It doesn’t matter whether you are a baseball fan or not, you will love going to a game in Jamsil. There are multiple teams that play there so there’s almost always a game. Spend a night as a Doosan Bears fan or cheer on the LG Twins. The fans are awesome and really get into the songs and dances for each player. Try to get in the upper seats along the first base line.Go to a baseball game because:- Tickets are pretty cheap (about 15 USD)- You can bring in your own food and drinks. - The food options there are pretty affordable (for stadium food)- The fans are amazing. See how Koreans enjoy this sport! "
Very cool! ,Since I was in Korea for a week we got really lucky and noticed baseball was on and did some research. It was really hard or near impossible to buy tickets online as nothing is in English but you can come 30 mins before the game and heaps of tickets still available. We got to sit near the middle for around $20 AUD. Very cool atmosphere and lots of fried chicken options. Worth coming even for a few hours (game can take hours)z 
The baseball stadium,"The baseball is the No. 1 sports in Korea. And this is the base stadium for LG Twins and Dusan Bears. It's a good place to feel the electricity.- If you are a newbie, the seat near the cheerleaders of home team zone will be great.- You can purchase various foods like chicken and beer. There's no ripoff. You don't need to buy foods before arrival.- It's an old stadium. Not that comfortable to watch the game, though."
"A good baseball experience in Seoul, but not the best in Korea. Extremely difficult to reserve tickets online.","I went to the Doosan Bears vs Nexen Heroes game on 09/25/18.I'm a Korean resident who has been to many baseball games here and usually I would reserve tickets for the home team fan section using the teams ticket vendor. The Doosan Bears ticket provider is Interpark, unfortunately this ticket provider is very difficult for foreign customers and online reservation is only available in Korean and payment can only be made with a Korean Credit card, not even my trusty Check Card could work.The Interpark website is available in English but you cannot purchase Doosan tickets on this site. A different ticket provider, Ticketlink, which provides tickets for the majority of KBO teams, including the LG Twins who also play at the Jamsil Baseball Stadium allows foreign residents to purchase tickets using a check card. If you want the best seats for a Jamsil Baseball Experience and can navigate the apps then perhaps seeing the Twins is a better option.There are a lot of foreign visitors to the Jamsil Baseball Stadium and unfortunately they had to rock up and buy a ticket at the ticket office before the game. Games rarely sell out at this stadium but this was over the chuseok holiday season, so it was almost sold out. Many people in my block were foreign customers who either didn't know about the reservation system or, like me, were unsuccessful in their attempts to reserve prime seats online prior to the game.Now, most games don't sell out, so the points that I have made here about reserving tickets online won't apply to many games, only for those which are over the holiday season or during the playoffs. I anticipate that buying Doosan tickets as a walk up fan would be impossible during the playoffs. While going on just any day is good, i would recommend you go on a Saturday for the best atmosphere and experience.Jamsil Baseball Stadium usually gets a high number of away team supporters, so the stadium divides itself into sides, the first base side is where the home fans will sit and the third base (in the sun) is where the away fans, and neutrals, daytrippers etc will sit.The atmosphere is good and the fans are loud and vocal throughout the game, there really isn't anything like Korean baseball and I would recommend that any sports fan should go to experience a game. However I just couldn't get into it because we were sat with the opposition supporters and had to watch the home fans, the team I had initially come to see enjoy themselves while us unfortunate folk on the our side got no freebies and were unable to join in with the atmosphere properly.While this review may not be the most positive, it is based on my experience and yours may be totally different and under better circumstances I'm sure you'll have a great time, if you are only in Seoul while visiting Korea then a game at the Jamsil Baseball Stadium is a must. If you're able to visit other cities then I'd recommend you head to Busan for the Korea's best baseball experience with the Lotte Giants.7/10 experience at the game.0/10 for the ticket reservation system."
Easy to get to ballpark in Seoul,Like baseball? In Korea? Like beer? Then this place is for you. Its an airy ballpark with cheap seats and cheap drinks. Front row seats at field level are ~30 USD. The cheerleading is fun to watch as well. Easy to get to via subway and/or bus.
Just do it,"Great experience for my girlfriend and I. As Western Canadians, we aren't really into baseball. But we happen to be walking by the stadium on our last day and said screw it, lets go in. Bought our great seats for approx $11 CAD, what a deal! The people selling the tickets didn't have a great grasp at English, but they still made seat selection and buying tickets fairly straight forward. I highly recommend seeing a Korean baseball game. What a surprise!"
Top 5 Baseball Games,"Hands down one of the most fun experiences i've ever had at a baseball game. I've been lucky to witness the SF Giants win 3 championships, and have been to playoff games, but the atmosphere in Korea is amazing. Everyone is engaged and having fun. It seems like every little thing has a fight song, you can't help but smile and enjoy yourself.If you are going to Korea, I would strongly suggest going to a baseball game."
A Must Do!,"If you are in Korea during baseball season, don't miss an opportunity to catch a game. Whether you are a baseball fan or not, you will be glad you went. There are plenty of websites that explain how to get tickets. In short, arrive at least an hour early and buy tickets at the gate. Pay attention to who is playing. Each baseball stadium hosts two teams. If the two home teams are playing each other, expect a sell out and you are not likely to get tickets (unless you are comfortable buying them from a scalper). "
Fun time,This was my first experience with baseball outside of the US and I was blown away with how loud the crowd was.I had a blast and I can’t wait to catch another game.
"Great, fun Korean experience","If you like baseball, this is a fun evening out, shoulder to shoulder with LG Twins fans. Beer and food is cheap (not like US stadium inflated prices), and there's energy in the air with cheers led by a cheerleader squad for the players at bat. The fans are friendly and enthusiastic, it's a lot of fun!Buying tickets online is next to impossible for a non-Korean, so don't try, Rather, go to the stadium and queue at the ticket window, The green outfield seats are cheap and perfectly fine. The red seats down the baselines are also cheap, and put you closer to the cheerleader action. Buy some thundersticks, pick a team to root for, and have a blast!"
Highly recommended to come and view a baseball match,"I am actually not a fan of baseball, in fact I know nothin about it. My hub is one and he wanted to come and catch a match since we are in Seoul. We were there for Doosan Bears VS NC match on a Friday. Bought the tix about 1.5 hours before the match (6.30pm) at 32k in total. Pretty good seats. The koreans were very enthusiastic and cheering for their teams. We joined Doosan Bear fans and boy, we had sooooo much fun! We were cheering alongside with them and I quickly became a fan! There were lots of fried chicken sold outside as well as beer! The match ended at 9.30pm but it didn’t feel long for us. Would love to be there again! "
Took my heart to a ballgame 🎶🎶,"We lucked out in getting amazing seats in outfield section 414 for the LG Twins vs Nexcen game. All for 9,000₩ a piece, we enjoyed the best of the hometown crowd, to include having a huge banner drawn overtop everyone. As English speakers we couldn't follow the words but we got into it, and sang along what it sounded like to us. The Twins didn't disappoint with a grand slam and double homer. They won the game and my heart. I'm now a proud owner of retired #9 Lee Byung-kyu shirt. Am incredible memory of my trip to Seoul. "
Amazing fun watching baseball,"Great stadium and great fun watching the communal singing and chanting for each team. Baseball is not major league, but good. Take your own food or buy relatively cheaply in the ground. Was just a fun few hours."
If you like Baseball you got to go! Even if don't that much ...Go!,"We love baseball and watch or attend American Major League Baseball regularly. So we thought let's take in a game in Seoul while we are there. It was a great experience. The Korean fans sing and chant continuously, they have cheer leaders and song leaders. It kind of reminded me of English Premier Soccer chanting. There is usually a fair amount of scoring. Everything is timed. So the breaks between innings or pitching warm ups is short. Tickets are not very expensive ($15 each). Concession and street food is available outside the stadium, and you can bring it in with you. Prices inside the stadium are not much more than outside. Go and have fun"
A must visit for baseball fans!,It's so lively and fun throughout the game. Tickets can be purchased few hours before the game it is super easy even for foreigners or if you can't read hangul you can get by just pointing out your desirable seat.
Best Baseball Experience Ever (Korean Baseball),"I've done two Korean baseball games at this stadium, and both were absolutely phenomenal. Tickets are cheap and easy to get at the ticket counter. Crowds are rowdy but polite. Beer was cold, cheap, and delicious. The entertainment and the games are always good!Get your seats in the ""Exciting Zone"" if possible. It's a few rows past and behind 1st and 3rd base. This is where all the action is. They have cheerleaders, mascots, chants, shouting, and singing. Always an electric and good time. Definitely worth it on a sunny afternoon (or night game). "
So much fun ,Even if you do not like baseball I would recommend going to a game here. I am a die hard mlb fan but I must say that Koreans know how to have a good time at the ballpark. Lots of singing and dancing and all around good energy for the entire game. Cheap and good options for food to eat as well. Let's go Doosan! 
one of the best again and again,"great stadium, outstanding fried chicken, big plastic jugs of beer and some of the best baseball fans in the world. always a great deal of fun."
Korean Baseball!,"So I am an official convert to baseball - Asian baseball! I loved baseball in Japan but really loved it in Korea. We went mid week which meant the crowd was small but that didn't matter. If you have access to a map, we sat in 106. Sit above that so that you get a great view of the dancers, mascot and MC. So much fun. My 8year old daughter enjoyed it too.Would do this again in a heartbeat. GO DOOSAN!"
Korean Baseball Madness,I can tick this off of my bucket list. Complete and utter insanity... more of a combination of American Idol and the carnival. Very difficult to watch baseball if you are a real fan. The music and dancing girls and singing never stops! A must see if you ever visit Seoul!
The way baseball should be watched.,I decided to go see the LG Twins vs. Doosan Bears and what a crowd! I happened to be sitting with LG Twins fans and whenever the Twins were up to bat their side of the stadium would break out in song and chants. Then whenever the Bears would go up to bat the other side of the stadium would do the same. What a fun night!
Brilliant....seeing a baseball game in Korea is an amazing experience,We spent a fantastic afternoon at the baseball stadium with our two sons aged 11 and 9. We watched the doosan bears and more importantly enjoyed the atmosphere in the stadium. There is great food and drinks available and the crowd atmosphere is kept alive by amazing k pop style cheerleaders....this is well worth a visit and a great way to see the Korean people having fun and enjoying time away from work .
Awesome atmosphere!,"I went to watch the baseball match between the LG Twins and NC Dinos. The atmosphere was amazing! There cheerleaders and each baseball player had their own specific cheering song. I also tried the famous chimaek aka korean fried chicken and beer combi there and it was very delicious. The stadium is outdoors and the weather was great as I went during spring. Would definitely recommend everyone to watch a baseball game there! Also, you can buy the tickets on the spot and it is not expensive, about 12,000 KRW for a relatively good seat."
1st base side,"I went to 2 games. LG Twins are more popular than Doosan Bears but great atmosphere for both. The Korean baseball stadiums are designed so the home fans sit in shade, visitors burn in the sun. So buy your day game tickets for the 1st base side. For night games consider 3rd base as there are fewer visiting fans. The cheerleaders for SK Wyverns stuck around after the game and I got photos with both of them! Also go up to the very top for a good view of the Olympic Stadium."
Great field for baseball,"The outside vendors are great, the convenience stores are plentiful, and the games are fun. Going to Jamsil is one of my favorite things to do in Seoul. "
Great atmosphere!,"It was our first baseball match, and we decided to go for Twins vs. Bears.We know nothing about baseball, but still enjoyed the game. The atmosphere was great: continuous cheering and chanting from both supporters sides. It was great fun to witness an almost full stadium in continuous rumbling. Ticket prices range from 7,000 yo 70,000 krw.Tip: to avoid direct sunlight, pick the Bears supporters side of the stadium."
Incredible Experience,"I've been to hundreds of baseball games and played baseball growing up and through high school. I've never once seen a baseball game as spirited and entertaining as that, especially for a regular season game. If you haven't seen a baseball game in Korea, you have missed out. Do it as soon as you can. Lots of fun! Great for families as well."
Korean major league baseballl,"What a hoot! We saw the Giants play the Bears. Full house of 26,000 singing, cheering and chanting fans made this great fun. This is a cultural experience! We had cheap outfield seats because reserved were sold out. In the 6th inning the visiting Giant fans filled plastic bags wth air and wore them like hats. It's a thing.... I recommend it. The stadium is at ""sports complex"" Subway and bus stop "
Great atmosphere!,"Went there to see the LG Twins vs KT Wiz. Baseball-wise, it wasn't very exciting, but the overall show and atmosphere make it worth a visit! Tickets were around $11 per person, but the best thing was that you could bring in drinks and food from outside. There are many small street food vendors and fast food places outside the stadium, where you can stock up before you go inside. Please note that you can only bring in plastic bottles. However there are plenty convenience stores inside the stadium, where you can buy a liter of beer for less than $4, making the whole game a very fun and inexpensive experience! It needs to be said, that with the start of the 8th inning, you cannot buy alcohol any more. If you're in Seoul, this is a must do!"
An absolute must go if you appreciate visiting sports events for the great atmosphere!,"Visiting a baseball match in South Korea was absolutely one of the best sport experiences I ever had!It was difficult to get tickets and the lady at my hotel helped me. I got the cheapest ticket, for the outfield. This section is free seating and (as far as I know) was the only european in that section. Did it made me feel uncomfortable? No way! I was really welcomed by everyone and they pulled me into the craziness called Korean Baseball!A great advantage is that you can take your own food and drinks with you. At the subway station and outside you can buy food and drinks. A plastic litre bottle of beer (frozen, so you have cold beer during the whole match) for about $3. Outside there is enough choice of nice food. Inside the stadium you can also get this but is more expensive. Korean Baseball is full of energy. The stadium is stuffed with people and there is a great vibe. Even for people who don't enjoy sport events or understand baseball this is great. The whole show around the baseball is an event itself. At First base there are the cheerleaders and the ""Hype-man"" An over active guy who ""stimulates"" the fans to sing the songs for the players. Every player has it's own song and everyone in the stadium knows them by heart. All the time the fans are singing and cheering. Never a dull moment! As I was alone and the only non-Asian in sight, but it didn't matter. People around me were SO friendly, In Europe and the US we could learn a thing or two how it should be! I was offered drinks, hugged and being involved with the songs. Communication was not easy, I don't speak any Korean and they don't speak any English. They enjoyed me choosing and cheering for their team and I enjoyed there warm welcome. Visiting Baseball gave me an opportunity to mix with locals and enjoy a great sports event.It was a perfect example that sports unite people! Many thanks to my fellow LG Twins fans who took great care of me!"
Great seeing a baseball game in Korea....,It was a lot of fun going to a baseball game in Korea. It is a lot different than attending a game in the U.S. The fans are very animated! Lots of cheering and booing and singing. It was a blast seeing the difference.
Festive Atmosphere,"I'm not much of a baseball fan in the U.S. anymore because the games can be a bit long and a tad boring. But games here in Korea are so much fun, even if you are not rooting for either team. Both sides have drumming, and fans chant and sing for every single batter--both teams have fans that show up. Definitely go if you get a chance just for the experience.Pluses:- easy to get to via subway- food stands just outside...and you can bring the food and drinks in--kimbap, dried squid, fried chicken, ttukbokki (rice cakes cooked in kochujang [spicy red bean paste]), etc.- restaurants just outside the stadium as well- very reasonably priced tickets...ours were $12 for a great view along the first base line (top level)- super festive and fun...you will not be bored!- we were able to get tickets at the box office a couple hours before the game"
Largest sports complex,"This stadium was the main Olympic Stadium, with an indoor gymnasium, swimming pool and many other sports facilities. Many international sporting, cultural events, and concerts held here. There are food vendors and convenient store on site. Subway Line 2, Complex Station, Exit 6 or 7"
Twins vs Giants. Awesome!,"Always wanted to see a National League game in Seoul. Bought tickets online for roughly $15 along the first base line. Took the metro followed by a short walk to the stadium. Waited in a very short line to collect our tickets, then off to buy the semi-mandatory jersey and hat. Properly attired we found our seats, bought chicken and beer (cheaper than in restaurants, almost like they want you to have a good time), and sat to enjoy the game. To say that Koreans are enthusiastic baseball fans would be to engage in massive understatement. They are simply off the charts baseball crazy. Each side has an MC and cheerleaders, numerous songs with hand signals, with explosive cheers for any base hit. It's a full immersion experience. A must do even if you wouldn't be caught dead watching baseball at home!"
Great place for a game,Plenty of food choices before the game. Ability to walk around the whole stadium without being dogged by ushers. Great atmosphere. Great time
"A taste of Korean sports, come for the atmosphere ","I don't particularly like baseball, but the atmosphere at these games is infectious. The crowd chant continously, cheer leaders dance, people drink beer and the fried chicken is everywhere. Good priced tickets and this is one of the biggest stadiums in Seoul. Only downside is that it's not that central location in Seoul and pre booking doesn't have a good English service. However you can often get cheaper seats if you get there early enough. But still try to arrive at least an hour before the game starts on the day to ensure tickets. The game of baseball wasn't great but the memories and fun with the crowd was amazing. "
A must do in Seoul!,"A must do if in Seoul!!! It was an amazing experience watching the families, fans and performers. It is nothing like the baseball games that we have in North America. First of all, you can bring in your own food and drinks. Yes, booze! Everyone brings in coolers full of food and booze. The fans are crazy. They sing along with the performers to the different chants during the game. It’s super affordable. Even the cheapest seats were not too bad."
Play Ball,Went to watch to the Doosan Bears and LG Twins. Really nice ball park. Very fun crowd and they have guys that have backpack draft beer! Great atmosphere and easy to buy tickets. If you want baseball in Korea this is a must 
Great baseball,Great stadium. Amazing fanbase! Koreans really enjoy baseball like no other in the World. Clearly the main sport in Korea. Attending a baseball is a must while in Seoul.
Love it and experience it!,"Fun, full of lively activity and a mature audience where watching a baseball game is exciting and enjoyable. There is a pleasantly clean restroom outside just about every entrance. Food is accessible and about 1-3,000 won more in the stadium. Outside the stadium, there are vendors also selling food and memorabilia. The ticket counter is quick and efficient. I have only waited in line at the most for 7 minutes. Yes, I did time it. The nose bleed section is the most fun, I think. However, I have sat right in front and in the middle. If you want to catch the foul balls, you need to sit in the first 15 rows. The last game I went to, I sat in the 300 nosebleed section and there were two balls that nearly made it up to where I was sitting. The facility is clean and well maintained. Just as in any ball stadium, you need to watch your step as you go down the stairs as they are extremely steep. One woman in her 20's was holding the railing as if she were climbing a mountain using a rope. She drug herself up to the last row in the stadium, right up a few rows behind me. She had terror in her eyes. That feat was just as enjoyable to watch as the game. Success!The games are full of TEAM SPIRIT and the cheers are full audience participation. So be ready to join in the fun and at times even jump up out of your seat."
Lotte Giants v. LG Twins,"I went to see a match between Lotte (Busan) and LG (Seoul), so naturally supported LG. The atmosphere was insanely good for a league match, and the chanting was so much fun, despite the language barrier - each player had their own chants!"
So Much Fun!!,"Highlight of the trip for sure. We were told by our concierge that since baseball is South Koreas favorite sport games sell out a week in advance and we would have to buy tickets from someone outside (we never saw this). I did some research and in order to purchase in advance online you need a Korean ID number, so we had no choice but to take our chances at the game. We took the metro and it was super easy, with the Sports Complex stop right outside the stadium. We arrived about 30min early and there was a huge crowd as expected, and people selling a large variety of food outdoors. I was a little perplexed by this as many people were buying food- I learned later that you can bring in outside food and go in and out with your ticket. We found the ticket office and there were long lines, but they moved fast. We bought outfield tickets (~$8USD) which we learned were first come first serve, so all the seats were either being held (people buying food outdoors) or occupied. If you sit in this section come early as we had to stand, with many others, until seats came available in the 6th inning... The atmosphere was amazing! When your team is at bat the crowd sings different songs, you get a show within a show! There is no announcer, which I thought was strange and the pitching was not great, but we enjoyed ourselves tremendously. I would highly recommend this, GO BEARS!!"
Baseball games will never be the same! ,"After reading the reviews from others, my husband & I decided to see a game. What a hoot! After this, American baseball games will seem as staid as golf tournaments. Although there was a chance of rain and the stadium wasn't full, those who were there were lively and my head was swivelling back and forth from the game to the MC and cheerleaders. My recommendation? Go to a game!"
The best thing to do in Seoul,"This is one of the best things to do whilst in Seoul. The crowd are amazing as they sing their reportoire of songs combined with the dancing, actions. If only the NRL in Oz was part like this. Certainly a great night out"
A Highlight of Our Trip!,"We took the subway to Jamsil Baseball Stadium to experience a Korean baseball game. Since the game started in the late afternoon (3pm?) on a fairly warm day, we opted to sit on the shady side of the stadium. Turns out we sat on the side of the Doosan Bears, the reigning champions! The enthusiasm of all the fans there that day was impressive - much like an American college football or basketball game - although maybe more so ... most of the fans knew all the songs and arm movements and performed them in sync. It was a lot of fun to be there! And the Bears won too! ;)"
American baseball take note!,I had the opportunity to watch a baseball game at the stadium. And what an experience it was. They have cheerleaders and cheers for their respective teams. The beer at the ballpark is very inexpensive. 1 L of beer is $3.50 or 3500 Won. If you're too lazy to go find food they have an app where someone will deliver the food to your seat. 
Huge amount of fun!!!!,"Korean baseball is something to behold - the crowds sing non-stop through the entire game (over 3 hours) led by the cheerleading team.Unlike US baseball, the Korean crowds are so passionate and noisy - my ears were ringing by the end of the game. They are also so friendly - even helping with a few words to the myriad of songs.Broader entertainment is also fun including the focus on a couple on the crowd to kiss as well as prizes for best dancers and a competition for who can down a beer quickest - through a straw...Can't wait to go on my next visit. Best seats are with whoever is the home team (Doosan or LG) and sit in the tier just above the cheerleaders (see photos). This is usually around 1st base. "
Excitement in crowd comparable to World Series,"I love baseball as it is exciting when my team is playing but I was excited when I visited Jamsil Baseball Stadium and I didn’t know a single player or where the visiting team was from. The crowd is unbelievable. The game was meaningless as I found out later it wouldn’t impede one of the teams from advancing to the playoffs. Regardless, the crowd sang and chanted throughout the entire game. I’ve been to a soccer match and it was pretty much the same thing but this is baseball. I’ve never seen this much excitement save for a World Series game in baseball. Then to top that off, there were these hot cheerleaders that danced and performed throughout the game. I’m glad I had on my sunglasses or my wife would have been pissed hahaha! The food was very cheap, the tickets were cheap, the ride on the metro to the front door step of the stadium was cheap and the entire experience was priceless. I HIGHLY ADVISE if you are in Seoul try and find out if there is a baseball game being played and DO NOT MISS OUT! You will see baseball in a whole new light."
Amazing!,"Decided to catch a baseball match in Seoul. It was totally awesome...the match, the crowd, the cheerleaders! We just sing along and cheer for the team and members we are supporting.There were prizes given out as well. The 3.5 hours was truly amazing and an experience. Definitely going for more matches if I happen to be there when there is a match.How to buy the ticket: This was the most challenging part as I tried to search high and low only to realize that only local are able to book the ticket online. The ticket booth will open 2 hours before the match so be there slightly early to grab the tickets. You need to choose the team you want to support before getting the ticket so that you will know which side you will be sitting. You will be able to see the game clearly if you are seated at the VIP zone or table zone. If you wanted to see both the game and cheerleaders, then blue zone will be good. If you wants to be nearer to the cheerleader, choose the red zone."
KBO Action!,"Stadium is right on the Metro line, is well maintained, food is inexpensive and tickets are cheap. Fans make for a fun and interesting game day experience.The quality of play is Minor League AA/AAA level and you might recognize a few American and Dominican players who have had a cup of coffee in MLB...Scott Copeland and ex-Blue Jay pitched for the LG Twins the night we were there.Only drawback is that the seats are a little tight for big American bodies!"
Korean Baseball is Amazing,"As an American, I have to say that attending a KBO game has been a highlight in my life as a baseball fan. The fans are amazingly awesome and the only thing I can think to describe it is that it's like a major league soccer (futbal) match. It's non stop cheering which creates a super fun atmosphere. It is highly entertaining; not only the fans (who are awesome!!) but also the level of baseball. I'll just say that the crowd goes nuts for a base hit, as well making as basic, ""routine"" outs. I love it and would highly recommend this experience to anyone - especially those with a MLB background. Trust me, you'll appreciate it. "
"Cheap, fun, way to spend an evening","Tickets are cheap, food is interesting, and the show the fans put on is entertaining. Throw in the fact that you can BYOB, and you've got a great way to spend an evening for any budget. Stadium is clean, convenient to reach, and staffed with friendly faces. I'd recommend it to anyone visiting Seoul. "
Electric local fun!,"My husband and I wanted to enjoy some local experiences and we decided on baseball - great choice! We caught the very efficient Metro and arrived to a wave of people selling fried chicken and beer but you will also find many sellers of the local tantalising delicacies such as dried Squid and Octopus! It was an electric atmosphere! The Locals are very passionate about their baseball (obviously heavily influenced by the US), they erupt in cheers and chants throughout, you can't help but join in! Thoroughly enjoyed it and met a couple of friendly locals too. "
Jamsil Stadium - Doosan Bears baseball,"If you have a chance during the season (check their schedule online), baseball games are so much fun in Korea ! The crowd is singing, chanting and cheering throughout the whole game. It's difficult to describe, but I rarely go to baseball games locally here, but have been to 4 games in Jamsil Stadium in Seoul.Tickets range from 8,000 to about 65,000 KRW (approx $8 - $65). Were were in the outfield bleachers on this trip. $ 8 ticket, and $3.50 for a 1 L beer. SO MUCH FUN !"
Great experience for baseball fans,"For those of you that love baseball in the US, I recommend seeing a game in Korea. I had the front desk at my hostel book the ticket online for me and I just went to the box office to pick up the ticket. I sat right behind the Doosan Bears dug out. The seat was in the first row and had a table in front and that was shared with two more seats next to me. It was money well spent. (40,000 KWN). Outside the stadium are food vendors that sell traditional Korean food (dried squid, chicken, octopus, etc) along with beer. I was so stunned when I was told we can take beer inside. If you buy a can, upon entrance there are clear cups you are to use to pour the beer into and throw away the can. The cans aren't allowed inside for some reason (I learned the hard way). Only bottles with twist on caps are permitted. There are also workers that walk up and down the stairs selling beer from a keg strapped to their backs. (If you don't want to leave your seat, this is another option). The game is family friendly and it's an experience to see how united the fans are to cheer on their own teams. I've been to a Japanese baseball game, and the Korean fans put them to shame. Go Doosan Bears!!!!! "
American baseball will never be the same.,"Awesome experience! The Korean baseball experience is unlike any sporting event I've ever been to. The fans, led by professional cheerleaders, are rowdy and politely obnoxious, taunting the other team with chants and cheers, singing and dancing. Thundersticks are available for inexpensive purchase, and are highly recommended to enhance your cheering experience. Fans come dressed in team jerseys, along with silly glasses and wigs, and put the New York Yankees ""Bleacher Creatures"" cheering section to shame. It's important to point out that although the cheering is loud and spirited, the games are still extremely family-friendly. There's no throwing of beer bottles, cursing, and inappropriate drunkenness like you might see at other events. Beer and food are inexpensive and served in giant portions - make sure to try the popcorn style chicken in a sweet and spicy sauce!"
Jamsil Baseball Stadium,"great experience, was my first baseball game,you can buy tkts via web or in the stadium but than you will have to wait in line a lot!there is 2 local times in seoul the twin and the bears.the game is long but its nice to see all the cheering of the fans.bring your hat its quiet sunny and hot, in the Stadium you can find fast food and snacks, and sport souvenirs shops.there is metro station close to the Stadium"
What an amazing event - don't miss this!,"We went to one of the ball games and having been to see the Blue Jays and Mariners I wanted to see how Korea treated the game. It was a great experience; the stadium is home to numerous teams so typically the stadium is split into two with one side cheering while their team is batting and then it alternates. KFC is ht etching to buy when here and we found the people we sat beside very friendly, even offering us the Soju they snuck in. Beer was quite cheap (bought by the litre in a plastic bottle). We bought tickets outside ht stadium and got pretty good seat for face value, I was told they don't scalp and no one rips you off either although I was with a lady friend who had lived in Seoul so maybe that helped. All in all, if you are any type of sports fan I would definitely recommend this experience."
Definitely include a visit to this park on your trip!,"Easy to find and get to, cheap tickets available the day of the game, an abundance of fried chicken both outside and inside the stadium, reasonably priced everything, and simply a lot of fun!Korean baseball is far more intense than the laid back American games. With cheerleaders and hype men, songs and fanfare, it is really an amazing experience."
Don't miss a chance to take in a baseball game,Growing up and loving baseball I had to take the chance to attend a game in Korea. All I can say is that they take the game to a whole new level. While the gameplay is still the same the crowed is 100% committed to cheering on their team. It made the game even more exciting. 
I hate baseball,My husband and I went to watch a game and the stadium was the best part of the experience. You can bring in your own food or eat from the many restaurants. There are coffee shops and tickets are cheap!
Doosan Bears!!!,"Even though the Doosan Bears had lost, it was still an interesting experience, tickets were as expensive as roughly 30.00$ CAD (33,000 Won) and as cheap as roughly 10,000 Won.The stadium can be pretty empty at times and pretty accessible for seat hoppers. The exciting part of the stadium was on the right side, yes, in front of the cheerleaders and hype guy stand. There were numerous opportunities to get food, beer and merchandise at decent prices, smoking is prohibited but I guess security can tell that to the large groups of people smoking along the outer wall. The tickets can be purchased with visa at the gate, you cannot order the tickets online unless you are a Korean passport carrier.You should be able to work a deal out with your hostel manager or hotel to throw some decent tickets together at a nice price, the tables in the 30,000 price range are great fun.The subway is right at the entrance of the stadium in front of the merchandise store (you can buy cheaper merchandise from the smaller shops independently owned in the Subway)."
Definitely try to come for a game!!,"If you're in Seoul, try to make it to a baseball game! They are nothing like north american baseball games - its always packed, high energy dancing and fans, as well as you can bring your own food/drinks or buy giant $3 bottles of beer and fried chicken to enjoy! It's a great time - one of the highlights of our trip! "
"Amazing environment, a highlight of our time in Seoul!","I am a former professional baseball player and coach, so catching a game at Jamsil was a must for my wife and me and it did not disappoint! The quality of play on the field is good - equivalent to High-A or Double A minor leagues in the U.S. - but the entertainment value is off the charts! It is very different than catching a game back home and we loved every minute of it! The environment outside the stadium before and after the game is lively and the fans are full of energy and enthusiasm throughout the game. Do yourself a favor and see a game while in Seoul!!!"
Asian baseball is amazing!,"I currently live in Japan, where baseball games are super exciting (think European soccer/football). I was not disappointed! It was amazing! I'm not sure if I can go back home and watch a game now that I've been at games in Asia. Songs, dancing, cheers, cheap food/drink... It's an absolute must (even if you're not a baseball/sports person)!!!!! GO TWINS!!!"
FANTASTIC!!,"Are you a fan and have an evening to spend? Then make sure and take in a Korean baseball game at Jamsil Park. Easily accessible via the metro the field is well- be prepared for an entertainment event. Other than good baseball the local fans ratchet up the energy level to a fevered pitch with their chanting, singing and cheering led by an animated MC and cheerleaders. We had a fantastic time and highly recommend its tons of fun!!"
Amazing day trip in nice weather!,"This was hands down one of my favorite day trips in Seoul! The crowd was so amped up (always is, Koreans love baseball) and it was definitely a glimpse of Korean culture. Its also really cheap-you can buy tickets for 7,000 KRW and they're still awesome seats! Bring sun glasses and an umbrella and lots of water-you can bring your own food and beer into the stadium."
Best way to be a Korean in Seoul if you are visiting!,"Attending a baseball game here was probably the most fun we had in Seoul. The stadium was built for the 1988 Olympics. We bought tickets in the ""cheerleader"" section and had such a great time with all the cheers, hand motions, beer, and grilled octopus."
Go Doosan Bears!,"Great evening out at the equivalent of a AAA ballpark in the U.S., but much more enthusiastic fans. Americans would be appalled to find singing and chanting like at an MLS game but it was great fun even though the hated Samsung Lions came back against Bears' relievers to pull out the win. "
"Euphoria, Euphoria everywhere!","Went here to watch one baseball game and it was an awesome experience to see a real life baseball match. The supporters kept chanting their winning song the entire match endlessly, they even provide each player with their own theme song.Each team has their own group of cheerleaders provided with their own stage and they are the one who made the stadium roars! Of course with the help of the supporters. You can buy a set of fried chicken outside the stadium, consider them as popcorn in Korea. 1 baseball match can take 4 hours so... Sit tight and enjoy the show haha.P.S. Go Doosan Bears"
nice ,"nice game ,,, was entertaining,,, would definitely visit again,,,the team i supported won so it was even better,,,,,,"
Great Venue,What a terrific place to watch baseball. 2 professional home teams to watch on various dates. It would be hard to imagine a MLB team allowing you to enter the park carrying a complete meal to enjoy while watching the game. The quality of the play is probably equal to AAA ball.. Very enjoyable!!
Great night out at the ball game,Went to a Bears game on a Thursday night and the atmosphere throughout the whole game was intense. It only cost us 8000 won each to sit in the outfield. The stadium is right outside the Sports Complex metro station and couldn't be easier to get to. We had so much fun that we might go again before leaving Seoul. 
Korea's best basketball stadium - visit on a Saturday for the most authentic experience,"The stadium is shared by the Doosan Bears and the LG Twins, both baseball teams with large foreigner followings. Personally, I am a huge Doosan Bears fan, but watching any team in Jamsil is a great experience!"
Very entertaining baseball crowd!,"Korean baseball is just so much fun. The atmosphere is incredible, with the fans chanting and singing the entire game! Also the tickets, food and drinks are cheap, and you can buy beer and soju right outside to bring in."
The love of the game,"What I love about baseball is the experience. I've been an avid fan for many years, but have recently lost the love of the game due to professional sports in the west. Going to a game in S. Korea was a breath of fresh-air, as the ticket prices were normal, fans were passionate about their team, and you get to choose your own seat as soon as you walk through the front gates. Koreans really love their baseball and it was a pleasure watching a few games while I lived there! "
#WTAsia2015,The crowd was beyond the best part (beside the Chicken and Beer)! There was so much unity and light!
Great time! What an experience,"This was one of the more astounding activities I took part in. I loved the in-game experience, so different than anything in Canada or the US. Tickets were ultra-affordable, and food and beverages can be purchased before-hand and brought in. What more can you ask for?"
Great time,Here is no better fn than Korean baseball. Had to get tickets especially n weekends . Always the most fun night for young and old. Americans are ten a little to wide for their seat so just stand and cheer.
Just go!,"Even if you are not a huge baseball fan, this is a fun time! A must do if you are in Seoul and easy to get to on the Metro. The box office opens at 4:30pm and the lines can be long, so I would recommend getting there early. The game I went to sold out. The energy was just incredible. They do love baseball in Korea."
Great atmosphere and reasonable cost,"I'm a huge fan of Major League Baseball. However, going to a game in Korea is almost as exciting. The talent level doesn't match MLB but the fans are into every pitch, chant each player's name, chant for a strikeout or a home run, and cheer for their team even if they're down seven runs.The cost is reasonable as well. You can get tickets from ₩8,000-₩15,000. Of course if you really want the high class tickets, you would spend ₩40,000-₩50,000 but those seats aren't really necessary. On top of that, there are pretty cheerleaders to make the game more interesting. You can also get chicken and beer which is the thing to do in Korea. If that doesn't suit your fancy, you can get a burger at Burger King or order a pizza!"
Americans head to the baseball game.,"We've been to a few games and if you've never been you have to go. Here's all the tips I know; tje subway exit for the sports complex is about 100 feet from the stadium, you can buy food and drink and bring it in to the stadium, you can leave the stadium as many times as you like, parkingat the stadium is 4,000 won, you CANNOTpurchase tickets online no matter how hard you try UNLESS you have a Korean alien number, buying tickets at the stadium gets a little dicey on weekends, there is a HUGE difference in atmosphere from the outfield tickets to the infield tickets (we prefer the infield tickets with our kids), the stadium can get super loud for 90% of the time (we lasted 1/2 a game the first time we went). Tips - beers are 3,000 inside, a little cheaper outside. Burger King and KFC is located right ououtside of the stadium. There is a GS25 convenient store right outside the stadium for soda, ice cream cones, candy, chips, etc. Bathrooms are huge but for some reason always seem as though they were just flooded out. Make sure you point to the map of the seating chart when you're at the window or you'll get outfield seats for sure. Make sure you say ""together"" when asking for the number of seats you want, if its a packed game they will assume your party will sit anywhere to get in. Sitting higher up on the first base side will keep you out of the sun. If the game is wrapped up by the 7-8th inning, LEAVE, and avoid the two-three hours of traffic driving a total of 10km. Hope this helps. Now go to the game!"
Lots of fun!,"There's so much fan cheering that you forget you are at a baseball game. Each player has his own song & when he is at bat, the fans sing his song.The cheerleaders, music & drums create so much energy. Easy to get to with the metro."
"If you're an American and enjoy baseball, don't miss this chance to experience the game in a completely new way","This is my second trip to Seoul for business so I decided to venture out and try something new. Since I was just at an MLB game in the US, I decided to go watch a pro game (LG Twins) while in Korea by myself. It did not disappoint. I highly recommend sitting in the home team's section, which is on the first base line. Be adventurous and sit in or near the main cheer section, which is located in 207. I sat in 205 row 4 and was quickly befriended by some regular fans sitting around me (as my picture can attest). They made me feel right at home and for 4 hours, I forgot about everything but the moment and trying to soak it all up."
LG Twins game,"Easily the best baseball experience I've had. Each player has their own song and chants and each side takes turns when their team are up to bat. Most of the excitement are in the stands. $10USD for great seats $3USD for beer you can get street food as you're walking in, easily accessible by the metro."
"Great fun, great atmosphere, worthwhile","Baseball is big in Korea and like most local sporting events around the world I love going to see and hear the crowd. The stadium complex is quite impressive too.What you need to know.Tickets are cheap, but spend the money to sit in the crowd. We spent 14,000 each to sit in the red zone, with the cheering and supporters. We got them at the stadium.You can take food and drinks in. Plastic beer bottles up to 1litre are accepted. There are shops selling beer/food outside and inside. It can be cold at night. In April it was about 8c in the stadium which with a breeze made it quite cold so rug up.Defiantly worth doing. "
Doosan Fighting!,"From 2013-2015, I have been to probably 30+ baseball games at Jamsil to cheer for my beloved Doosan Bears! Some of my favorite memories in Korea have been at this stadium. I've made many friends at the stadium and experiencing a baseball game here is like no other place on Earth. Is this the best stadium? No way. I would give the stadium itself probably 2 stars. But it is the overall experience that you will remember. The fans are the most passionate I've ever seen, constantly cheering, dancing, and celebrating. I was once at a terrible game where the Bears were down 17-0 in the 9th inning and yet the fans were still cheering as if they had a chance to come back and win. Unbelievable! Tickets range from 8,000won (general admission outfield) to 15,000won (infield and cheering sections). You can get table seats behind home plate, but I don't recommend them since you will be away from all of the excitement in the cheering sections. The best section to be in or near are 207 and 307 since that is the heart of the cheer section for the home teams. The stadium is home to both the Doosan Bears and the wretched LG Twins. Both teams' fans sit on the 1st base side. Away team fans sit on 3rd base side.If you are coming to Korea for vacation between March and October, I highly recommend you fit in a Korean baseball game. It is often overlooked on must-do lists for Seoul, but I guarantee you it will be a cherished memory. For example, my 78 year old mother came to visit for about 12 days and she said the Bears game was the highlight of her trip! Even if you are not a fan, you will have a blast. DOOSAN FIGHTING!!!"
Fun way to spend the day,"The spontaneous crowd and cheerleaders made the baseball match very exciting. We felt the need to stand up and cheer along with them even though we didn't know Korean! The ticket sales can be a bit tricky because everything is written in Korean. Just follow the queue and tell the person behind the counter roughly where you want to sit. After getting your tickets, go grab some fast food, chips and beer and enjoy the game!"
Ridiculous in the best possible way,"I only spent two weeks in South Korea, but this baseball game changed my life.Previously, I thought baseball was boring. No longer. Featuring tickets so cheap we felt we had to correct the ticket seller we wanted 5 tickets, not 1 (they were actually just that cheap), beer so cheap we had the same debacle as with the tickets (just that cheap again) and dancing by cheerleaders I can only describe as the epitome of high camp, this was one of my favourite things in SK.At times it was easy to forget that sport was actually taking place, but there was. Having absolutely no clue what team was what, about the league structure, or even, frankly, what sport I was even showing up for, I had a great time, and the team we picked entirely at random won 12-3. Thoroughly recommended, and try and get tickets in the ""cheering section""."
Great introduction to the game!,"I lived in Seoul for a year and had no idea about BB, so my first games were watched here. Had a great time, good staff, well stocked shop and friendly locals. Worth catching a game! "
A Fun Sunday Afternoon,"Watching Korean baseball is an interesting cultural experience for an American. The Korean fans are continually cheering for their team and are organized with a leader, drums, dancing girls and noise makers. It is as much fun watching the fans as it is watching the game. The fans are into the game but also courteous and friendly."
Lively and fun,This was my first baseball game ever. Great day out. Koreans love their baseball. I had never experienced baseball but I had heard that it was a good day out. It was. I brought my ticket at the stadium on the day. The line was long but after asking some non Koreans where to go I found the ticket booth ok and the lady selling tickets spoke English. Worth it.
Cheap and fun baseball,"Paid ₩12,000 to watch the LG Twins take on the NC Dinos. Got to the stadium ~1 hr before game time and got seats down the 3rd base line. In Korea, unlike the US, the visiting dugout is on the 3rd base side, so our side was full of NC Dinos fans. The stadium is extremely easy to access from public transit. Sports Complex exit of subway Line 2 drops you off just feet away from the ticket booth. The fans are very enthusiastic, there are cheerleaders, and the beers I had were only ₩3,000. Seeing a game here is a good way to have a night out, even if you aren't that big of a baseball fan."
Great night out for peanuts,"For next to nothing (W9,000) watch some quality baseball and experience the weird and wonderful world of Korean baseball. Grab a couple beers, some hot dogs, rice cakes and a ramen and you're away!"
"Must Do if At All Able, Even If You Aren't Into Baseball","I lived in Seoul for two years, and even though I had heard that korean baseball games were fun, not being much of a sports fan I put off going until towards the end of my stay. Now, I really wish I had taken advantage of going more often. A baseball game here is less like a sporting event and more like a big party. It is totally unlike anyhting in the USA and absolutley worht the time. I think even if you had just a short trip to Seoul, attending a baseball game here will show you more Korean culture and traditions than hours and hours spent exploring the city.Make sure that you stock up on food and beers before you go in. You can bring literally anything into the stadium. Out in front there will be tons of vendors selling food and booze before the game. And, once inside beer and food can sell out. Although, the nicest thing about Korea is that they don't gouge you on prices at places like this. The prices inside will be about the same as the prices outside.Last tip, after the game, especially if your team wins, don't plan on going home. Instead, join the throngs of people outside the stadium in the plastic tents and chairs where you can keep drinking and get food like Ramen and other simple dishes."
Great Fun,"If you're even just a mild sports fan, this is a must do. Here in Korea the local fans take cheering for their team very seriously. There will be cheering competitions for each side of the stadium with a lead gentlemen MC and a few beauties around him. The fans will make more noise than you would ever imagine, sing songs about each player (to the tune of a current hit), dance and more. The cheering is as important as the game, maybe even more so. You are allowed to bring food into the stadium which is also a plus. Pack a back, pack the family, and head out to a ballgame. Just fyi - think Minor League ballpark and you'll have idea of size. "
Biggest Baseball stadium in Seoul,"I go here often to catch games. It's the biggest stadium in seoul but that doesn't actually mean they have the best facilities. Personally I don't like their food and restaurant choices so unless you only want old pizza or fried chicken I would suggest bringing in your own food and drinks!Sometimes it can be a bit confusing figuring out the proper entrance for your ticket, it's not the most organized of stadiums, but if you're a baseball fan and in Seoul during baseball season stop by for a game!"
Free game!,We were able to catch a free game. There were only a few people watching but it felt as if it was filled to the brim by how enthusiastic they all were. Had chicken while watching the game and bought ourselves coffee too from the stands just outside the main area since it was very cold that day. It was a great experience to watch baseball in Jamsil. Hoping I could watch a full game on my next trip!
Awesome Experience,"Definitely worth going to a game if you get the chance. Might not be tied to a team but the cheerleaders and the crowd will have you rooting for one by the end of the 3rd inning. Not like baseball anywhere else, except maybe Japan."
Favorite way to spend my weekends,"Basically my second home during the baseball season...while it lacks character, the atmosphere can't be beat...by far the best place to watch a ballgame in Korea...there's a home game pretty much everyday except Mondays during baseball season (Apr - Sep) as either Doosan Bears or LG Twins will be hosting a game...unless it's a Saturday or Sunday game vs one of the popular teams (Lotte, KIA, or a Doosan vs LG game), getting a ticket on the day of the game should not be a problem...food inside is fairly priced but options are limited...but you can bring your own stuff in (except hard alcohol)...home team crowd sits on the 1st base side and away team crowd sits on the 3rd base side..."
A fun way to enjoy baseball,"If you have never been to a Korean Baseball game, this is a MUST see thing to do. The Korean baseball experience is a bit different. There are cheerleaders and the food in the stadium is not too overpriced. Plus you can bring it whatever you want...beer...a pizza.. they dont care!!!"
Doosan Bears,"Watching Korean baseball in this stadium was fun and easy. Buying tickets outside was easy, although the games are usually very busy, some walkup tickets are always available before each game. You can buy food and beverages outside the stadium and take them in, plus food inside is reasonably priced. I recommend at least one game to any baseball fan."
Easy to buy tickets,"We were told about baseball games by our tour guide. He explained it was easy to get tickets and it was. We looked up game times, trained it here and had a fun afternoon experiencing our first ever baseball game."
Funny atmosphere,"This baseball stadium is located in front of the Olympic Stadium in Jamsil (near Gangnam).I've watched a LG Twins game (home team) massacre the away team. Food in stadium is good, bathrooms ok, sitting view good.The best thing is the atmosphere, even in a regular Tuesday night day at 7pm, there is so much fun, music, and cheerleaders keeping up the nice and funny mood. "
Baseball Merchandise,The best place to find the baseball merchandise... when u come during tournament time.... affordable price... easy to acces...
Korean baseball - Not to be missed,Liked everything. Inexpensive. All seats have good views of the field. Buy food in the stadium or bring it in with you. Prices are the same. Plenty of vendors at the park entrance from which you can buy food and beverages.Easy access by subway.
"Fun, cheap way to spend an afternoon, a must see","If you've never been to a Korean baseball game, it's an experience you shouldn't miss. The crowds are extremely energetic, all of the seats have excellent views, and there are cheerleaders. The tickets are cheap and you can buy them directly at the stadium on gameday. Some quick tips, buy your beer and food PRIOR to entering the stadium. There are no rules against bringing outside food into the stadium. However, if you need to buy something inside the prices are extremely reasonable. The prices are just MORE reasonable outside. Also, upon exiting the subway there is a ticket booth that everyone will be waiting to use, this line is extremely long. If you walk to the left of this booth about 25m there is another booth that is generally empty. "
Great experience,The Korean fans are unbelievably! Very vocal and enthusiastic throughout the game. Great party atmosphere.
good atmosphere,"if there is baseball match, you should come and watch the game. the atmosphere is great. the korean supporters are great"
Beautiful!,It is really near metro station. Very big and beautiful. You can go from it to COEX or Gangnam-guб it takes you about 20 minutes on foot or 5 minutes by bus or metro
LG Twins Home,"I like well-grown green grass on ground and facilities such as CVS etc. But, it is difficult to find a appropriate entrance written on ticket."
Amazing atmosphere,"Jamsil stadium is a great place not only to watch a baseball game, but to experience Korean culture and people. Korean cheering is absolutely amazing, with cheerleaders, cheering songs, and very supportive fans. It's also possible to bring your own food (and booze) in the stadium or to buy snacks just outside of eat, so it's also a treat to eat and have a drink there. On the baseball side, Korean baseball is pretty competitive, and the stadium feels over 25,000 fans, so it does have its own ""major league"" atmosphere. The only drawback is that the stadium, which is about 30 year-old, as well as the rest of the Sports Complex, feels a bit run down."
See the fun side of Koreans,"If you want to see Koreans away from work and school and having fun go watch a baseball game. The baseball is good and the fans are enthusiastic. They even have cheerleaders. The price is very affordable and no matter where you sit you will have a good time. The price of food and drinks to include alcohol is reasonable, prices for food are not jacked up like they are at American sports venues. Great for friends or families."
Best experience in Seoul,"Having little knowledge of baseball, but in general enjoying sports we bought tickets for the Seoul-derby, and what an experience this was. Amazing atmosphere, great fans etc. In short, just go there no matter if you like baseball or not. It'll be awesome"
Baseball Games in Korea are Entertaining!,"Although I'm a huge baseball fan, I think that even my mom (someone who can't stand watching baseball on TV) would love going to a game in Korea. Here are the main reasons why you must go to a game in Korea.#1 The fans are ALWAYS in the game. They have a chant for every player. Even the opponents fans compete with the home team's fans for being the loudest.#2 You need to have chicken with beer. In Korea, the word for beer is ""mekju"". Combine chicken with ""mekju"" and you have ""chi-mek"". It's cultural, not expensive, and satisfying! You can also get Burger King or order pizza at the game.#3 You can watch pretty cheerleaders and one guy with a whistle help lead the cheers. #4 Tickets are much more affordable than in the U.S. You can get a good seat for 10,000 won which is about $10. #5 Easy access to the subway- Just get off at the Sports Complex station and come out of Exit 5.#6 If you go to Jamsil Stadium, you have two teams to pick from. The LG Twins and Doosan Bears share the stadium and play their home games there. When they play each other, the games are even more exciting."
Awesome experience,I visited with coworkers and had an awesome experience. I had a little trouble finding my seat as the ticket was not in English. The conessions were great and the cheer squad kept the crowd motivated. 
Sit with the cheers quad.,"I'm not much of a fan of baseball but found this game to be quite quick, interesting and at a reasonably high skill level. The small stadium size made it quite an intimate experience which was also quite enjoyable. Each team has its own cheer squad which adds to the event, there are the traditional ""cheerleader"" girls but also men, drums, costumed mascots and that sort of stuff. I found it made the experience a lot more interesting and wish I'd asked for seats closer to them. Food and drinks are as disappointing as any other sports stadium in the world. However you can take your own beer, other drinks or food in to save some money and have better food. We ate cold Burger King burgers. "
Amazing fun!,"We recently attended a match between LG Twins and Nexen Heros, what a night!The crowd is fantastic, the food and drink is cheap and our seats were only 10,000 won each. Getting tickets at the stadium was also easy.Can't wait to return!"
Great fun!,"So much fun to watch a baseball game in Seoul. Stadium was easy to get to via subway, plenty of concessions in and outside the stadium, prices were reasonable, enthusiastic fans and fun to watch cheerleaders. "
I love Korea baseball!!!,"American baseball is boring and expensive. Korean baseball is exciting, inexpensive, and awesome!!! There are cheerleaders, thundersticks, and awesome times. There are beer and chicken places in the stadium. You can bring in outside food and drink. You can leave the stadium as much as you'd like. "
Baseball Game,Korean baseball is an experience all by itself...they have cheerleaders and each batter have their own theme song. I love baseball but this is something all on its own...the enthusiasm of the fans is awesome 
Great Korean experience of an American past time!,"I'm not a big baseball fan, but I thoroughly enjoyed going to a game here! The crowds and fans showed their loyalty through lots of synchronized participation. There was lots of chanting and air motions that everyone did to support their team of choice. It made it very exciting to be there! Despite the fact that our seats were closer to the top of the stadium, we had a great view of the beautiful stadium, mountains, and a skyline as it got dark. I didn't see any drunken/rowdy fans that I've encountered during baseball games back home, which proved how family friendly this place is. Plus, the bathrooms were very clean and there was even a Smoothie King inside the stadium, which was a nice treat during the first innings of the game. Plus, guests are allowed to bring outside food into the stadium, which I could advise to do. Vendors even sell in bags and pre-packed boxes for your convenience!"
Baseball with cheerleaders!,Watching a game in Korea is super fun because of the songs and general atmosphere of the stadium. Food is reasonably priced as is beer and other refreshments.
Baseball,the game was very exciting and the spectators wre fascinating! It was wonderful.
A super fun experience!,"I am an American baseball fan, but I don't think that's a pre-requisite for enjoying baseball at Jamsil in Korea. It's just a really fun, and different experience, and Koreans love their baseball, so, no better way to do as the locals do. I could not figure out how to pre-purchase tickets, so we go to the stadium two hours before the game and waited in a massive line for GA tix. We got them, about $11/ea, but when we got inside, there was literally not one seat available. They WAY oversell the stadium. Not to worry, you can put yourself anywhere there is a bit of space that will fit you. It's crazy! During the game, everyone bangs sticks and chants and cheers. Also, plenty of food and alcohol is on sale both inside and outside the stadium, and you get in and out privileges, and, you can bring alcohol from outside into the stadium! Baseball at Jamsil was one of my top favorite things we did there. Full blog post, with video, here:http://postandjones.com/2014/08/22/seoul-baseball-in-korea-i-said-baseball-in-korea/"
what a weather,"nice stadium nicer fans but weather.I am not super baseball fan, but it was one of best experinceSee you at next trip to seoul"
We are now Doogan Bears fans,This was great fun. Get there early to get good tickets but they are cheap as is food and drinks. You can also bring your own beer. The fans get right into the game and you can't help but get swepted up into their enthusiasm. Clear highlight of Seoul.
One of the campest things I have ever seen ... a MUST visit,"We attended an LG Twins game versus the Dinos tonight (15th August). Took our 2 year old and 7 month old. Had tried to attend the baseball a few times and it had been 'rained' out due to the mildest of spittle. Anyhow...Arrived at 5 an hour early to get tickets and seat. Cost 10000 won each to get tickets in blue area behind the 'cheering' seats (so about 6 quid a seat from ticket booths on day of play and these were not worst seats, they start at under 4 quid!!). On way to seats bought a load of food and drink, including can of beer from inside the stadium at a GS25 that cost 2600 won each - unbelievable value compared to sporting venues in UK. We sat down in the visiting Dinos area. Whereupon a rather colourful gentleman stood on a podium in front of the 'cheering sections' and started doing a dance with some of the most elaborate moves I have ever seen, in a peculiarly flamboyant manner. At this point I assumed someone would glass him and we would move on. However, the entire section of visiting fans (many thousands) then stood up and copied him. Old and young, rich and poor, male and female. As he span, so did they. As he thrust his hips out so too did they. They even rubbed their chests in unison with him. I have honestly never seen anything like this at a sporting venue - or indeed any other venue - in my life. This then continued throughout play. The gentleman had a break while the Dinos were fielding but came back every time the Twins were batting. In his absence four young women took his place also to be copied by the stadium. As the evening went on I watched huge quantities of alcohol being consumed. A couple of blokes in front of me nailed a pack of 24 beers between them in under three hours and then started drinking sojo. Not surprisingly perhaps the dancing became more energetic - and seemingly dangerous - as this continued. I cannot be sure if this was a one off and if this was simply a one off with the Dinos. If so I advise you to follow them anywhere in the country. What I can say is that we saw a very different side of Korean culture tonight. All the people we encountered were friendly, chatty and out to enjoy themselves (it should be noted very few near us were there to watch the baseball). This was the best thing we saw in Korea. To be honest we have not particularly enjoyed Seoul or South Korea at that. This has been overwhelmingly down to the people we have met ... we have traveled all over the world particularly in Asia and bar a few people who were incredibly kind in Korea, the vast majority of people we have encountered on this trip have been cold and even rude at times. Lots of websites speak of the South Korea as being 'rudest nation' and we even found the lovely people we met would open a conversation with an apology for their fellow country people, but still we had to experience it to believe it! Sadly it does not outweigh our other experiences in Korea, but Jamsil Stadium is certainly somewhere I would recommend starting, kind of puts rest of what you see in perspective. TIP: - Although food and beer cheap inside, so not a problem, consider taking a picnic with you (or indeed a crate of beer like the blokes we saw!) for a very cheap evening. - Definitely aim to sit in or behind the 'cheering' section (in red seats marked with a star)."
So much fun!,"I don't even like baseball, but we had a great time watching the LG Twins and the Samsung Lions play. The songs and dancing are a lot of fun! Grab a pair of the sticks that make noise!"
A lot of fun!,"This was truly a lot of fun going to a baseball game. You can buy your snacks and drinks outside the stadium and bring them into the game. I would suggest getting all your stuff from a single person outside for better deals on food, beer, etc. and they will sincerely appreciate your business. In terms of tickets pay a little bit more to get on the baselines thats where all the action is. Not to mention the outfield was over capacity. "
Baseball in Korea,"What an atmosphere. Koreans definitely take their baseball games in differently from Americans. There was non stop cheering, every fan seemed like a diehard one, and everyone seemed to be having an amazing time. I really can't give the atmosphere justice by describing it here in a review. Look it up on YouTube or see the excitement for yourself. The prices were a bit high, even for Korean standards, and the stadium itself is old and not aesthetically pleasing, but those are very minor problems. I strongly recommend anyone to go regardless on your like or dislike for baseball."
Great atmosphere,Went to a baseball game of the Doosan Bears (they have an english website and it's easy to find the schedule) The atmosphere was great. Both the home and away fans cheered their teams with chants. We got the cheapest tickets but the sight was still good and we could move freely and choose some other free seats. Drinks were not too expensive and it was possible to bring food from outside. I am not so interested in Baseball (we didn't stay till the end) but can still recommend it.
So Much Fun ❤️❤️⚾️,"The cheerleaders cheer for both teams, the crowd cheers for both teams, there is not a favored team or an opponent there is just the love for sport...baseball. "
Go if you like baseball. Go if you don't.,"You really don't have to be into baseball to enjoy this game. Gather up your friends, pick a team, and enjoy the hype and cheers and cheerleaders... And yes, some baseball, too. It's a cheap day out, made even more so by the food and drinks that you can buy right at the subway station and bring inside. As you're unlikely to care whether LG or Samsung wins the game, there's no let-down regardless of the outcome, so it's a win-win day!"
baseball in Korea is a different experience,"The home team lost 8-0 but almost everyone stayed and cheered enthusiastically the whole time! If you have never been to a game in Korea, you will love the cheerleader, the fans and the dancers. Don't miss the opportunity."
A must for any baseball fan,If you love baseball you will adore it in Korea. Admission is very cheap as are the beverages and food ($12 gets you prime seating).Get a seat mid way up along the first base line and you will find yourself in the middle of the home team cheering section. They cheer throughout the game with dancers and everybody really gets into the chants. If you favour the visiting team there is a similar group along the third base line.A fun and interesting cultural experience that is safe cheap and family friendly. There are 3 Seoul based teams so there is a game on most nights in Summer.
Great atmosphere,"We went to a game recently while in seoul. Price start at 8,000 won. We paid 12,000won each and got front row tickets. You can buy food and drinks within the stadium. Atmosphere was great. Game lasted over 3 hours so good value for money. And our team won!!"
exciting,LG: DooSan match is really exciting. Closed by subway station.
Great experience,"Easy to get tickets for the baseball pre -game , amazing atmosphere and sights.Well worth an evening."
Go Doosan!,"I don't like baseball, but everyone kept telling me that I have to go to a baseball game in Korea. Well they were right. It's nothing like baseball in The States. Koreans are serious about baseball and soccer, and the cheers, music, and chicken are just as important as the game. It's energizing to be in Jamsil Stadium cheering on the teams. I still don't like baseball, but I enjoyed myself there. I even bought a jersey. Go Bears!"
Super fun...if you have time.,"One of the best experiences in Korea (for an American) was a Korean baseball game. Didn't matter who won, it was a good time. This is for sports enthusiasts in the summer or people staying longer than 4 days. Culturally, its not a must see- but a lot of fun if you have time to go and time to explore. :)"
Even if you're not a baseball fan..,"Professional baseball game in Korea is something different from that of America, and for that reason alone it is worth a visit if you're in town during the season. There are 10 professional teams in Korea, and oddly enough, Jamsil Baseball Stadium is the home to two Seoul-based teams- LG Twins and Doosan Bears. Unlike American ballparks where most spectators are home fans, Korean ballparks are divided into both home and visiting team's fans, as Korea is fairly small country. 1st base side is where home fans sit, and 3rd base side is where visiting team's fans sit, and you will notice this as each side has their own cheerleading team, complete with female cheerleaders and a male head cheerleader who leads fans to sing along to each players' anthem and help out with dance routines. It is pretty noisy and they keep doing it even when pitcher's pitching, so it could get annoying, but it is a part of Korean baseball culture. Try to get into its groove and sing and dance along with fans, that's half the fun in itself. Jamsil is the biggest ballpark in Korea and while it's little bit old and rusted, a great place to soak up korean brand of baseball. Have fun!"
Korean pro baseball is unlike anything you've seen,"Maybe you were on the fence about going to a Korean pro baseball game. How different could it be, you say? Go. You won't regret it. Take the subway and get off at the Sports Complex stop. It dumps you right into the outside of the stadium. It's impossible to miss it. Walk up to the ticket booth and get some cheap seats, the $12 red section seats in the 200 level are great because they're in the middle of the action. But first, peruse the thriving street market set up in the parking lot for something to eat to bring into the game. Or pick up a few cans of beer. Not brave enough to try street food, they've got KFC and Burger King at the stadium. Once you're in, its like nothing you've ever seen. The baseball is fun to watch, high-minor league level with lots of offense, but its the fans who are the real show. The stadium is split in two with the first base line supporting the home team and the third base line supporting the visitor. There are competing cheering squads staked out at the base of the 200 levels urging their partisans on and the crowd offers up chants and correographed cheers to the booming sounds of club and rock music. What a spectacle."
Great atmosphere. Loads of snacks.,Easy accessibility via the trains. Tickets are affordable. We watched the Doosan bears face off against the NC dinos. The atmosphere is great! And there are so many snacks to choose from. There are even guys wit chilled backpacks of beer walking around to sell beer.
Our best stadium in Korea,"This staduim was founded in 1988, for Jamsil olympics.Now 2of our baseball teams, Doosan bears and Lg twins use this stadium as there homeground.Of course our baseball class is lower thabn MLB or Japanese leauge, but pretty good.Experts said that our level is around AAA thesedays.( before, they said our level is just A or AA)So it's not that boring.And cheering culture in supporters are very impressive.You must come here and have fun.Keep in mind, It will be hard for you to book a ticket....cause we don't have a English interface in booking websites.But you can book a ticket on Doosan bears website or Lg website, it'll be a little bit expensive comparing to other booking websites though.I recommed you to try once, if you are a baseball lover.I'm sure that you can enjoy yourself in Jamsil stadium."
Great baseball,High quality baseball. Lots of fun. Not just peanuts and popcorn to eat. The fans are very active during the game.
Great time,Had a great time watching the game. easy trip on the subway. Its an interesting variation on the American version of the game! A must do!
A Unique Experience!,"From ease of access to moderate pricing, Korean Baseball gives you a lot for your Won, and Jamsil Stadium in Seoul is an excellent venue! Games provide a truely competitive atmosphere that extends from the field well into the stands, as fans for each team populate their respective sides, following the cheer leads, resplendent in their teams' colors. 20K - 30K Won gets you an excellent seat on either baseline, and 10K puts you in the outfield (8K on weekdays!). There's no gouging for food, either. You'll pay the same price for fried chicken (or any food...) inside the gates as you will outside, and there's no such thing as the $10 beer / hotdog! Come for the pagaentry and splendor, and to appreciate the efforts of both teams! If your trip allows and you are a sports fan, this is a must for your 'to do' list!"
Fantastic Game: My First Baseball match,"This is the first time ever that I have watched a baseball match. Surprisingly, the tickets were really cheap. Even though we did not have the prime seats, the view was just as good.The downside was the purchasing of tickets as you need to be a local in order to purchase online. We went through slight difficulties and finally able to secure the tickets with the help of our guest house receptionist.The mood was awesome with cheerleader kept going on and cheering for the batter. If you want to watch a sport, Baseball is definitely the sports to go to. No travel is ever complete without immersing yourself in their culture (and the Koreans love their baseball)"
You haven't seen baseball until you've been here ,"I'm not a big baseball fan and don't really have much opportunity to see a game in Europe. However after all the positive reviews about the stadium and its fans, my wife and I decided to go. It was easily the best atmosphere we've ever had at a sports event. The tickets are very inexpensive and the crowd is amazing. Don't miss it! If anything its a great place to watch people. "
Not Your Typical Baseball Experience,"The fan experience at a baseball game in Seoul is incredible. The atmosphere is more like a European soccer match with the crowd chanting and singing. There's also cheerleaders that lead the crowd and they make the most noise when their team is up to bat, which is quite the contrast to baseball in the U.S. Definitely check out baseball game in Seoul if you get the chance. So glad we did. "
Go!,Baseball in Korea is not to be missed. The show in the stands is almost as fun as the game! Tickets are cheap! So is food and beer! 
You must take in a game at least once in Seoul!,"The baseball game is really just the background entertainment; it's the overall experience that makes this a must do while in Seoul. As you exit the subway (Sports Complex - Green line #2 exit 5 or 6) you will be swept up in the energy buzzing around the stadium. There will be countless street and fast food vendors selling food, beer, and team gear. Also be sure to pick up a pair of slap sticks as they're all part of the fun inside. No need to purchase tickets ahead of time. It's quick and easy to walk up to the window and buy them on the spot for less than 10,000won. You will also be able to bring in all the food and drinks you want into the stadium. From pizza to beer, you're allowed to bring it all in or simply buy it inside. They don't jack the prices up once you're inside the venue. And then there's the cheering. From the first pitch to the final out, the cheering never stops. It's electric, entertaining, and an all-around great experience. Don't miss it."
Really epic for a baseball game.,"They got Power Ranger Cheerleaders! OH MY GOSH! IT WAS CRAZY! I've never had soooo much fun at a baseball game, and I liked staring at the drunk foreigners. Most cheap and entertaining game I've ever seen even though I don't like Baseball! hahahahaha. "
Amazing Experience,Attending a Korean baseball game is an experience unlike any other baseball game you have ever attended. The Koreans redefine the idea of exuberant fans and the atmosphere in the stadium is absolutely amazing. I am not much of a baseball fan but still thoroughly enjoyed my visit to Jamsil Stadium and am planning to visit again before I leave Korea.
"Best thing to do in Seoul by far. Stop thinking about it, just go.","The atmosphere is absolutely amazing, you don't need to be an avid baseball fan to get how brilliant this actually is. If you like sitting outside, eating amazing stodgy food, drinking cheap beer and seeing a truck load of excitable Koreans going mental (who doesn't?) then you really need to go here. I usually hate sports but even I got to figure out what was going on and became really engaged. There's loads of food options, easy to come and go as you please. Loads of booze if you want it. Easy to navigate with loads of signage in English and English speaking staff. Very easy to get to on the subway (has its own stops) Killer merch and electric atmosphere.The cheerleading and the chants are so unique, it just makes it such an amazing, fun night out.Wish I could've gone more than once."
The stadium which attracts people all over the world,"""The stadium visit will be memorable due to two factors. Firstly the match witnessed a nail biting tight finish. Secondly, the stadium was a place that had all the latest and modern facilities one could have ever thought of. The stadium has signs and boards placed all over the place to guide even a new visitor. I personally did not feel a single requirement to ask for directions from people. I tried and used my own common sense first to find the required enclosure and then to take exit.The stadium was full packed and accommodated a large number of people. Stalls of food items were present and amazingly you can get any food item of your choice from the stalls set up there. There were some people who were crazy food lovers and I saw them taking more interest in food than the match. I love this stadium!"""
baseball stadium,Soooo much fun! Chanting and cheering between fans..so much energy! Much cheaper than tickets in the United tates. Can bring in your own food and drink.
Always fun and nice,Parking like most stadiums isn't easy and there is lots of traffic on the way out like all stadiums so public transportation/subways is always a plus. Lots of fast food and other restaurants. Most seats are great and games are always fun no matter what team you are rooting for.
If you get a chance you have to check out a baseball game...,I have been in Korea for 5 years and i catch a game as much as i can.. The price is cheap and its an experience in itself.. They purchase plastic bats that you fills with air and you band them together instead of clapping. This is non stop through the whole game and the fans are into the game and they cheer and to the wave and its full of energy. I am a Doosan Bears fan so i love to watch them against another good team. We purchase chicken and beer and eat at our seats with everyone else doing the same. Its alot of fun and you never get bored.. Check it out and catch baseball fever!!
See korean baseball,"Korean baseball is more like a European football match or NHL hockey game in fan cheering and participation. You can bring your own food and beer inside, which is a great thing, and keeps the costs way down compared to overpriced USA concessions. You can even leave mid game and get more beer and snacks from various vendors and carts outside and come back in with your ticket stub, so no need to carry in a twelve pack and three pizzas all at once. The fan interest is fun to see, flags waving and stadium wide chants and camaraderie. Having many teams play in the same city creates a lot of rivalries within family and friends. The game itself is a little less refined than an MLB game. Think wild pitches and fielding errors rather than a perfectly pitched game, but that makes if fun to watch. "
A Must-Do in Korea,This is a great attraction in seoul and I highly recommend going to at least one baseball game while you're spending time in Seoul! The energy in the stadium is like no where else in Seoul! Such a great time and not very expensive! I highly recommend you grab some friends and make a day out of this great activity.
Baseball at a fevor pitch,"Koreans love baseball. They absolutely love baseball and it is a social event. Go the game and inevitably share soju and make a new friend. There is no way around it. The crowds are crazy, completely into it and cheer most for the home team."
What an experience!,"Another must see in Seoul. We managed to turn up at 2pm to buy tickets for a 5pm game. One of the biggest atmospheres I have ever experienced at a sporting event. Buy a shirt, support a team and hope that they win! (luckily mine did). Go here."
Stumbled upon a great game,We were looking around the grounds of the 1988 Olympic stadium when we heard a road of cheering at a nearby stadium. We decided to look into what was going on and learned it was a baseball game. We bought cheap tickets and sat with the Bears fans. Wow - the fans are so into the game! They all knew the chants and were loving every minute. I recommend attending (if only for a few innings) if there is a game on.
Korean Baseball,"Interesting to see baseball from another culture. The fans are as rapid as Japanese fans with the similar routing rituals. The tickets are cheap, you can bring in your own food and beer and the baseball is good (but the games are very long). Surprisingly, the field itself is poor and the facility isn't all that well maintained. I enjoyed it but was surprised at the quality of the stadium."
well maintained stadium,The stadium built for 1988 Seoul Olympics is in excellent shape and well maintained. The star gallery brings nostalgia of earlier Games. The track which saw a couple of World and Olympic records is hot and live. Must see for sports lovers. 
"Korean Baseball, a worthwhile experience",If you visit Korea you must see a Korean baseball game. The experience is entirely different from an american baseball game. 
When in Seoul...go to the Baseball!,Very well organised park. Excellent atmosphere with cheerleaders and locals going crazy cheering on the Doosan Bears.A must when in Korea. Good fun for a night out.
