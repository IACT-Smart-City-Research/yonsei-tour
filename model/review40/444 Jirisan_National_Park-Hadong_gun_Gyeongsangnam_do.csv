The heritage Jirisan Mountain,"This was a good experience to visit this temple as I’m Indonesian. According to some articles, The best time to visit this area is spring as I have just visited this temple in the early autumn. Nearby the Jirisan Area there is Ssanggyesa temple which built since 1632..We need to walk some distance but it was a nice pleasant walk. This was a very good atmosphere in a secluded site."
Stunning surroundings,The Jirisan National Park is so vast and beautiful. It was an adventure to walk around. It's definitely a must see when you visit South Korea. Spring time was the best :)
Wonderful Must See,Nature lovers must not miss this place about three hours away from Busan .Take a package tour for quick and easy access .Inside walking trails amidst foilage in fall colours with streams of fresh waters makes this such a lovely place .Just beautiful ..you can also do camping here ..bring water bottle along and walking stick if you wish after being properly clothed for hike with walking shoes on .
One of the Largest Parks in SK,"This beautiful park is 472 km2 (182 sq mi); it is the first national park named in South Korea. It touches 3 cities and towns. About 45 of my coworkers and I went on a cloudy Thursday. We took a bus 2 hours outside of Daejeon. There are several pathways and trees. The location is massive and full of natural beauty, including streams and bears. It took about 1.5 hours to climb to the top and 1 hour to come down; I stopped along the way to catch my breath. There were many older people who climbed faster than me. There is a cafe, eating/sitting area and a bathroom just before you climb up to the peak. If I was not with my coworkers, I do not know that I would have ever visited this national gem. I recommend going, if you are in the area. I do not know any overnight accommodations; ours was a day trip."
Just Gorgeous,"We ended up going here on a whim, by bus from Jinju. It was about an hour and a half ride. The park is big and has several places that are access points. I coould not really tell you which one we were at, we just got on the bus and went. We could see Mt Jirisan, which is lovely. It is an all day climb and must be begun early in the morning, with lots of water, good shoes etc. One must go in the park by late morning or they will not let you in. We did hike, not being prepared, but it was worth it just to look around. "
One of Koreas legendary mountains.,"When I was in North Korea, Chilbosan, our guide there told us about the 6 legendary mountains on the Korean peninsula (5 in the North, 1 in the South). The one in the South is Jirisan. Since I was heading to South Korea after the trip in the North, they recommended me to go to Mt. Jiri. And so I did, together with my South Korean girlfriend we went in the early morning, because it could be really hot during the day. We didn't hike all the paths due the lack of time (and perhaps condition, haha), but it was a great view. Definitely recommend seeing this for yourself :)"
One of the most scenic and challenging mountains in Korea.,"I was in Jiri San last year, where I hiked for few day along a marked way and with refuges to stay along the way. The path was magnificent and the views superb. Only problem is the booking for the refuges that must be done several weeks in advance and is often fully booked quite quickly. The koran are great hikers and very friendly."
Great trekking,"Jirisan was my favourite place in South Korea. I walked up to Cheonwangbong peak (1915m) and wished I had more time to do some serious trekking there. The mountains are sooo beautiful! Note that there are ""beware of bear"" signs everywhere though there're just 4 bears in Jirisan so not a big chance to meet one of them :-)"
Piagol Valley and overnight shelter Jirisan NP (West),"This was simply a wonderful overnight trip. The walk up the valley was stunning with the autumn colours and with the stream pretty much an ever present companion. The terrain is rustic, not like some of the Korean walks (especially on Jeju) but easily manageable. We intended to stay at the Piagol shelter, which although described as basic, is anything but. It is one of the smaller shelters and is about 3-4 hours into the walk at a leisurely pace (we had our 8 yr old son with us). You don't need to book and it sleeps about 35 in a new wooden structure. Downstairs has separated ""rooms"" that could sleep 4, no doors. Upstairs is totally open plan flooring. . We took our own therma rests and sleeping bags but blankets can be hired for 1000 won, no sleeping mats. Overall cost was 5000 won each, bargain. There is a kettle available but only basic snacks and two tables on the deck for cooking.We dropped off our bags and continued up the valley to the ridge. This got progressively steeper and took another 1-1.5 hrs to the path junction from where you can go either direction across the ridge.The night prior to the walk we stayed at a camp ground further down the valley. Excellent shower facilities and platform sites for tents. 20000 won."
Best Hike in Korea,Lots of different routes. We did a 2 day hike that involved staying in pension in the mountains. The hike it self was pretty special and gave a good opportunity to mingle with the locals. Make sure you check with the tourist office about which routes are open and bring your own cooking equipment. 
The low point of my South Korea trip,"I thought I'd spend the day in Jirisan so took a bus to Gurye. When I got to the bus station, there were no maps, except for the usual unhelpful large comic book affair on the wall with a couple of teddy bears. There were no English leaflets in the leaflet holder, no one spoke any English or could tell me how to get to the park entrance or the bus to get. When you step outside of Gurye bus station, there is a small collection of buildings but I couldn't find any minbaks or motels so I guess they must be somewhere else the area. After getting thoroughly pissed off with this for an hour and trying to find out basic tourist information, I went and got a ticket to Busan. I hope S Korea gets its act together for the Winter Olympics in four years, but not having basic information available easily in its main tourist attractions around the country, even if it is just a simple leaflet with 'you are here' and 'this is how you get to the park entrance' is going to cost local businesses money."
must-go in South Korea,"Jirisan National Park is one of the biggest and wildest nature attractions in South Korea. There are several hiking routs and they are not very hard, but you should start your vay at least 3-4 hours before it's dark (and unsaf!) to do the shortest one. On your way you'll find beautiful waterfalls and ponds. You can swim in one of them (it's very refreshing!), if noone sees you. Officially it's prohibited."
"Jirisan, very beautiful scenery - 智异山","There is few options to climb to the top and we chose the easy way. There is a coffee shop Coffee Benne at the entrance, avoid rocky road for those suffering ankle pain or sprained before. This is the first time I been there and I will go again with my DSLR."
"Largest, Most Wild National Park in Korea","Jirisan National Park stretches into 3 provinces, and is by far the largest national park in Korea that doesn't include ocean. Jirisan is famous within Korea for its long history as a sacred mountain and its role during the colonial period as a hub of resistance. While most national parks in Korea can be experienced in a day-hike, I feel this is not sufficient here. Jirisan is far more remote and expansive than you might expect.My experience in Jirisan was largely focused around Hwaeomsa Temple. While the hiking here is far from the most famous natural feautures of the park, the setting is serene and the the temple is full of national treasures. I desperately want to return to explore the entire park."
