Worth a Visit,"If you have an afternoon to spare, this is a great place to go especially if the weather is nice. Stroll through the tiered walkways of sculptures and ponder each as you go. Some are very unique and interesting. Most have an English translation. There is an arboretum of small bonsai and some flower beds nearby as well. If you continue to climb, you will also pass a Buddhist Temple and eventually reach the top of Yudalsan overlooking the Mokpo bridge, although we didn't go that far this day. Be ready for lots of walking/hiking if you do go all the way up."
Ok for a nice stroll though the park.,Nothing really spectacular.While you are walking though the mountain area this is at the far end of the park.Various sculptures of different things..
Halfway resting place to the Yudal Mountain,Pleasant place to visit but hte sculptures were not exceptional.Nice place to stop & rest either on the walk up or down from the Yudalsan
Amazing,"This park is a jewel. Perched in the Yudal montain it not only has a great view of the city and ocean but dozen of momumental sculptures. Each piece is unique and beautiful, the park is clean and very well kept and there is even a temple at the top of the mountain. "
Nice place to go for a walk,"There was nothing really outstanding about this place, but I was a nice place to stroll around. If you have some free time in Mokpo I would check this place out, but I wound not go out of my way to see it. "
"A beautiful, historic, peace filled hike","Just up the hill from the train station and downtown Mokpo is Yudalsan - Yudal Mountain. As you climb the mountain you enjoy sculptures with plaques telling the history, 2 canons (My understanding is one still is shot off but I didn't experience that), beautiful pagodas to sit and rest and enjoy the view (both of the city and the surrounding seaport), and the peaceful feeling of being in nature, even when you are mere moments from the busyness of the city. Pack a picnic lunch and make your way up the mountain to enjoy the beauty of South Korea!"
I am not into sculpture but this grabbed me!,"Don't let the 'International' in the name fool you, - only six of the park's dozens of sculptures are from non-Koreans. Originally opened in November 1982, this was the first outdoor park for sculptures in Korea. The 48,000 square-meter park originally displayed sculptures leased from the Korea Sculpture Park Society. When the lease expired, however, the sculptures were removed. In August 2008, the park reopened with a new set of sculptures representing the theme Nature, Culture, and Sculpture. It's a nice variety of art, from completely abstract to some with a more understandable meaning."
