Activity,"Queue was long! On a sat evening so expected. The after 5pm tickets were cheaper but not by much. Alot of family friendly rides, not really for thrill seekers. Only Boomerang was mad, the other coaster were so-so. The food variety here is crazy. The fireworks happened right in front of you, so the view was crazy awesome even though it was a much smaller scale."
Mediocre park,"I think if you have kids they would like this, but fot 2 adults the rides were just ok. Mostly carnival type rides. The boomerang coaster was fun, the others the lines were too long because it was some sort of holiday. We got kind of bored after a couple hours so left. If spending several days in Daegu maybe check out, or if with kids. Otherwise skip it."
Unique,eWorld is a great night out for all ages. Go after 5pm for a discounted ticket - you’ll have more than enough time to do everything. It closes at 9pm in Summer. It was very quiet and we got on every ride without queuing. Only problem is if you are tall like me. I’m 6’ 3” tall and I was too tall to fit on the “Camelback” rollercoaster l. On the “Hurricane” I was hit on the head by a tree branch but it was more funny than sore. The boomerang was excellent though. The park looks great in the dark with the thousands of bright lights flashing!
Biggest amusement park in Daegu.,"Biggest amusement park in Daegu. I guess it is bigger than any other in Busan.39000 for adult. It is very expensive to me. But I guess it is better than Lotte World or Everland in terms of waiting line. If you choose a good day, you may enjoy any attraction without waiting here.I didn't go inside but I would if I could get some discount."
Great Theme park I’ve had visited !,I and my boyfriend went to this place for our dating. It was wonderful and fun. Even it was crowded but I love it. I went to the theme park in Seoul before but didn’t feel local because lot of visitor are foreigners but I can feel local here ! I’ve tried roller coster and giant swing and I love it so much. I also went to the tower. The view was great and good for a couple
Like a dead amusement park,"Honestly, we wouldn’t even have visited here if we knew the conditions of the theme park. First of all, there weren’t many visitors to begin with. I have never been to a theme park that looked so quiet and dead. Most of the rides and games were not operating. The weather was cold and it was drizzling a little, only a few food trucks were opened for the visitors but managed by the same one or two staff. The mini zoo was poorly maintained. Rabbits were all hiding in the dirty cage, looking spiritless.Why do I still rate E-World 3/5 stars?We visited the theme park with an intention to catch the cherry blossoms and not so much for the rides. Cherry blossoms indeed made up for everything else since it was full bloom during the festival period at E-World. Secondly, the theme park did look more beautiful at night when the lights were switched on. It was pretty empty but then again, we didn’t have to queue up for any rides that were operating during our visit. (Actually we only went for the viking ride and we were the only persons on the ride haha)Lastly, I wouldn’t recommend to purchase a separate ticket to go up the 83 Tower unless you really want to catch the cityscape of Daegu. Visitors can still hang around outside the tower, which has a similar view as well."
sad treatment of animals!,"I visited your amusement park last weekend.I was disgusted at the condition of your poor rabbits!It was very sad to see. Some of them looks sick, and had damaged body parts and clear signs of illness.If your animals are ill, gor whatever reason, they should not be on public display. They should be It is very sad, I even spoke to a member of your staff. They explained that a lot of them get ill, but they are there for peoples fun and are not well looked after!Your petting animals in the farm were also clearly being bothered by young children, and sadly there was no member of staff to look after their interests.I would suggest, if you do keep animals for econmonic game, you have a responsibility to treat them with respect and keep them in good health. Your young visitors would learn more about respecting animals and your animals would be happier."
Amazing,"We went to this park in early afternoon and stayed until about nine. Not even once did we wait in a line except for waiting for the current run of the attraction to finish. There are many exciting attractions, I recommend the 360 spinning one especially. Probably the best amusement park I’ve ever been to, I cannot recommend this enough. "
"Inexpensive, deserted, and good for kids","E-World was a $5US taxi ride from our hotel. We wen on a weekday, about 6 PM. It was deserted, which was a big bonus for my 9-year-old because he could ride rollercoasters and bumper cars over and over again! Admission was about $20US each, but this does not include access to the Tower. You can take the skycar to the top of the park for free and see the whole park. The park lights up and the only other people you'll see are high-schoolers on date night. We spent about 3 hours there and the were closing the restaurants, so we walked down the block to a restaurant instead."
Nice place to visit,"Visited the park after 5 p.m. Entrance fee was only 21000 won per person which is little more expensive if you're entering the park before 5.00p.m. Well maintained park and full of various eye catching decorations. Nice place to go and enjoy with friends or family. So many mind blowing rides such as rollercoaster s, Viking etc. 5 min walk from Duryu station in Daegu subway line 2. "
Very nice.,"We reached there after 8pm and couldn't find tickets. The last ticket can be found at 8pm. Night view is just awesome. Lot of lights, nice music and good roads for walking. We have small kids with us but no any issue. All is just fine.If you are in Daegu then this place is a must place for visiting."
Amusement,We made multiple visits to E-World. Its a great place to spend time with family or a date night. Its better when the weather is warm because the wind blows cold in the winter.
"Small amusement park, not bad.","I went here with my students and had a great time with them even though it rained part of the day. Many rides and snack/food places. Personally I don't feel like there is much to do around Daegu so if you are here for a visit, it may be worth going. The price might be a little high. My price was discounted when I went."
A must-see attraction in Daegu!,"E-world has a number of rides aimed at both kids and adults. Some are more thrilling than others, as is the case at most Amusement Parks. What sets E-world apart is that it surrounds the 83 Tower and that it can be enjoyed in seasons.When you eventually tire of the rides or get hungry, there are a number of dining options available - both western-styled and traditional Korean food."
Much needed fun,"We came to e world on the last day of our 2 week holiday. After 2 weeks of exploring temples and other historical places it was a much need day of fun for my son.It is expensive to get in but we did get a whole day of entertainment, the rides were fun. The little petting zoo was a little sad. The tower was included in the price and we did go up and visit it, well worth a trip to the top. My son really enjoyed his time here and it was well worth every penny to see the huge smile on his face."
After school fun,"This is a small amusement park but just enough for young children to have a great time. The entrance fee is kind of high but everything inside the park is very affordable. If you plan on going more than 3x a year they offer an annual pass. If you decide after your first visit that you want it, take your receipt and tickets to the membership office that same day and they'll apply what you paid that day towards the cost."
Warm Nights,"I had an amazing time with my niece at the park. We went at about 7pm on a week day there was no waiting in long lines we were able to maneuver through the park and enjoys sights, sounds and food :) I have been a few times I remember when it was called WOO BANG LAND .........good time no to expensive and the park is broken down into a section for younger children and for older children-adults. I would allow my child to maneuver on there own through the park with no worries."
"fun rides, good beer, and jumping of woobang tower was fun.","Great food in the revolving restaurant it is very high end. The urinals face out and are glass so it feels like taking a leak 200 meters up. is the highest tower in Asia (202 meters high, 312 meters in altitude). It has a sky lounge cocktail bar and a restaurant that revolves around the tower's base, giving diners a panoramic view of the entire city. Other restaurants include a cafeteria, Korean restaurant, and Western-style barbecue. Woobang Tower Land has regularly scheduled events each season. During the winter, people enjoy a snow sleigh. During the spring, visitors can observe the flower festival in the gardens. During the summer and fall, the park offers many performances, concerts, and exhibitions. The Tower Skyway (cable car) travels across the entire park, allowing visitors to get a bird's eye view of all the park's rides an shows."
Entertaining Place to Travel in Daegu,"This is not a big amusement park but it's OK to visit when You travel to Daegu, South Korea.many rides You can ride, and there are 3 roller-coasters. Try Boomerang rides, I recommend it."
Not to big but fun,"Right next to the tower. Is pretty and has some rides. sometimes the wait times were super long but during the week is less. nice little zoo towards the end of the park with nice plants and such. during the winter you could slide down a snow hill, during the summer they wet the grass and you can do the same. fun!"
a fun enough distraction,It's not going to replace Disneyworld in my books but it's good enough for Daegu. A fun distraction for kids or kidults. The cable car ride alone is fun enough. 
Meh,"The highlight of this place is playing in the hamster ball in the pool with friends. Apart from that, do not go on the tambourine unless you want to damage your back."
GREAT!!!,Very tiring but in a good way. Many different rides for different ages and sizes. The cable car up to the tower was included in our day pass. The view was absolutely gorgeous. Definitely a family day out type of place. Not much variety of food and restaurants on the grounds but once in the tower we got some Ashley buffet and wine and all was well again. 
"Go in the evening, tickets are cheaper! Worth a visit.","If you're from the states, or a country blessed with amazing amusement parks, then this may not be for you. But, it is a nice little amusement park, with things to suit almost everyone. A good tip is to go on an evening, the tickets are much cheaper and the park is lit up in lights and creates a really nice atmosphere on the night time. It is easily accessible by bus also. If you want to do something else on an evening other than drink alcohol :), then this is definitely worth a visit."
Three roller coasters,Well if you want to pop in and out to get a thrill on the roller coasters then go for it. The frontage looks great but inside and the colours have faded on this resort. Bringing young kids in! they won't know so I'm sure they will have a great time here.
"Worth an afternoon visit, with or without kids","While E-World isn't as big as Everland in Seoul it is still a fun place to visit for kids and adults. It is also near Daegu 83 Tower. If possible, visit at night - the lights around the park make it so much better!"
Okay,"Try here in evening or night. On high season it opens until 10pm and sells all ride free ticket 10000KRW, around 8~9USD entering after 4pm.(on the internet)Flowers are well decorated and several rides are nice. There are tower but you need to pay extra to get to the top deck. This place also has small zoo area closing at 6pm. There is a ride the small boat goes around the water way which has the most line. Most rides are for kids but still enjoyable. Just keep away from the foods they are selling. Unhealthy and expensive."
It's small but nice for kids to play,"We live in Daegu. We bought a membership. It is nice to go for different things to see for each season. We went for a cherry blossom festival. They have nice big cherry blossom trees! It was beautiful!When you get a membership you also get discounts from 83 tower as well. Ice skating link and some restaurants, food court, Ashley buffet. We enjoy going there to spend family day out. "
E-World/Woobang Tower,The rides were mainly aimed at kids so this part of the day really didn't hit my standards for theme parks. I was really excited to get to the top of the tower and do the Sky Jump. We payed to get to the top but all of the restaurants and bars were shut and there were no refunds available. The Sky Jump was also closed which rendered the entire ticket useless. Definitely phone ahead and ask about opening times etc before you go! The view was still breath-taking!
Small amusement park,A small amusement park with not much people. It can be said no need to queue for playing attractions. But not much worth to see. Also can visit 83 tower with good view.
Disappointing,"I paid the full price admission (33000 won) for a day pass, but it felt like money wasted. Most of the rides weren't open, though looking at the amount of rust on rides like the Hurricane, that seemed like it was probably a good idea. The rides that were open were fun, though, and the log flume is highly recommended. Camelback, too, is a lovely little roller coaster that's perfect for people who aren't looking for the greatest thrills. However, even the rides are nauseating, and I couldn't ride more than a few at a time without feeling sick. The zoo is also one of the saddest places I have ever seen."
exciting rides and lovely environment,"If you are in Daegu, South Korea, and looking for some excitement, then this is a must visit place for you. The admission fee is expensive, but after 5pm its very cheap. The main attraction is the woobang tower. Ride on the cable car and go the basement of woobang tower. Go to the top floor and you will see the magnificent view of the city. There are roller coaster rides which I really enjoyed. The food are also good. Nice place to visit with your family and friends."
Go there with the intention of just going to the lookout tower,The park itself feels a little bit like a haunted theme park. There was hardly anybody there and most of the rides weren't in use. The only good thing to see is the Daegu tower which offers some impressive views of all of Daegu. My recommendations - better to save your money or at least enquire if the rides are operational. 
Fun way to spend a few hours,"If you go after 5pm it's only 16,000 won ($14). The views from the top of the tower are impressive and when we went they were doing a special light show for Christmas. It's expensive but if you're young at heart you'll enjoy it. There's a couple great roller coasters, bumper cars, a terrible Tambourine ride (seriously ride at your own risk!) a haunted house and a cool cable car that goes through the park. I think kids would love this park too."
Expensive for next to nothing,I and my wife went here just after children's day....a beautiful sunny day....we paid almost sixty dollars and observed an under repair site with a third of the attractions and shops open. I would not recommend this park to my worst enemy....a big waste of money.
Family place,"Fun for the kids! Mine isn't old enough yet, so we didn't do rides. It's better than wild waves in Washington but ain't no silver wood in Idaho or Disneyland. But we had great family time! Probably not worth the season pass."
Good to go with Family! It's fun for Family or with Friends! Fun fun!!!,We had a blast at E-world! A lot of rides and zoo. Alot of stuff to see. Make sure to visit the tower and eat on the 77 floor revolving reataurant. So much fun! My first visit April 2013 with Family. I will definitly visit it again! :)
Take the little ones,"Not the biggest theme park, but still plenty of fun. Mini rollercoasters and a few fun up-side-downy rides. More rides there than I was expecting, but hardly a thrill seeker"
At your own risk,Not the most up to date park and some of the rides are sketchy but that's all in the experience. Its really about the people you go with. Be sure to take time to go up the tower and get a good view of the city. Also one of my favorite parts of the park was the trick eye museum at the bottom of the tower. I got some really cool photos there with my friends.
Good if you have the time!,"This is a nice place to go if you have some time to spare. Nothing compared to a lot of themeparks in other countries, but the basics are there. A few rollercoasters, a flume ride, viking ship etc are all there.Tickets were approximately 28,000 per adult for a whole day (all rides inclusive).Lines weren't long at all, at most we had to wait for 30min.There are many activities catered to young children.Plenty of places to eat inside. All the facilities were clean and in good condition.Overall, it was a nice day out!"
