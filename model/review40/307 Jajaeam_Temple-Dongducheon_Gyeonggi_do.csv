Beautiful road to jajaeam with good atmosphere,"CY+c ( 19.03.23 ) Though there was small temple and normal structure, but the road to there was very good. To there, about 30~40 minutes from parking area, it was good walk to us with fresh air and beautiful view. There had the cave Buddhist sanctuary that was beautiful. Good to enjoy nature smell, view and feelings on the way to temple."
Six Peaks and Serenity,"The temple complex itself is a relatively modest compound nestled into the base of a cliff and ridges leading to the six peaks that constitute the Soyo San (Mountain) Park. While it gets lots of visitors especially on Spring and Autumn weekends from Buddhist pilgrims given the attendant lore which stretches back well over a thousand years, it does not suffer from the level of traffic that afflicts many larger temples. The circular geography of the park allows you to either start at the temple or hike across the six peaks and finish at the temple. The peaks are modest by Korean standards measuring between 500 and 550 meters above sea level and can be traversed in between 2 and 4 hours depending on one's stride and stamina. Getting there from Seoul by car will average about two hours on Highway 3 passing through Uijeongbu and Dongducheon. I'm no geomancer, but there is an aura of serenity about the place that has kept me coming back since my first visit in 1998"
A mindfulness temple,I dont know anything about this temple architecture but I love the stream and the cave in this. It's so beautiful and it makes the people feel the value of each moment clearly.
Peaceful ,"I hiked to the four major points, some spots more scenic then others.The first point was the hardest to hike up, many stairs and hard to maneuver areas.Please be careful, I would not recommend children go with you. Some areas up top the maintain are straight dropping points.Stay vigilant and enjoy the views."
Quiet escape,This is a great place to just get away. I hiked the entire mountain in about 4 hours going pretty quick. Bring plenty of water and some snacks. Wear layers since u will warm up quickly hiking nearly straight up. 
My JajaeamTemple review is based on a you 'must see' for yourself should you be afforded the opportunity tdo so....,This most serene spirited site is one that I will always keep coming back to that will last a life-time for me. My favorite time to visit is early fall when you get to see and view the beautiful different colorful scenery of Soyo Mountain and the surrounding area plus the weather is so serene pleasant during this time of the year.
A long commute to go to church.,Koreans love to hike/walk. So this place is popular with locals. There were monks there when I went and the people along the trail are surprised to see tourists. The trail is well maintained and steep in many places. ADA is not a Korean thing. There is a cool restaurant at the bottom of this hill where you can get coffee before or beer after your long walk. There is spring water at the top so bring a bottle if you dont want to use the community cups. 
Room with a View,"Must do if staying in or near the Dongducheon/Camp Casey area. A nice walk, very approachable for anyone even moderately physically fit. Getting there: I followed liljazz01's instructions to the letter and had no trouble finding the place. Seeing it: to be honest it was a bit further to the temple than I expected (2 miles? from the train station?) but about the time I was ready to give up on it, there it was. Level of difficulty: 2. There are stairs to climb, but they are sturdy and well-treaded and so not so treacherous, even in foul weather (it was 40F and raining when I went). Lots and lots and lots of grandmothers hike this trail. It's just a nice walk. For the dedicated hikers and more physically fit among us, there is a more challenging trail that goes up the mountain and for that the temple is just a startpoint. Why go: The temple itself is lovely but the real attraction is the scenery. The trail follows a winding streambed and when conditions are right there are waterfalls. Afterward, if you're hungry (and you will be), there are a number of restaurants at the foot of the trail. I can recommend the Soyasan, a fairly large restaurant serving hot pot-style meals, right near the intersection of the road that leads to the temple and the road that leads to the Freedom Protection Museum."
Awesome Experience,"If your stationed in Korea, have a day to kill and want to get a good leg workout i recommend this place. Lots of photo opportunities. Tips/Info:1. Cost 1000W to get in.2. Wear comfortable shoes and clothes. Hiking boots or combat boots recommended but not necessary. 3. Get there early if you want to do the longer trails.4. Not all trails have stairs, some have ropes to help you pull yourself up. 5. We caught the Taxi from the Casey Commissary and told him Soyosan Mountain. He took us there for 5200W. Took about 10Min tops.6. Bring water and snacks."
Awesome hike in a beautiful place,"Someone already mentioned how to get to Soyosan via vehicle, but it's just as easy to take the bus or train. The 39 bus will take you all the way there, or alternately, you can take Line 1 (dark blue line) to the last stop, which is Soyosan. Upon exiting the train station, go straight ahead to the main street, walk right to the first crosswalk and cross the street. You can start walking right and turn left down the first alley, go straight, then follow the street around. If you get lost, just follow the groups of people in hiking gear. If you forgot your hiking gear or want new stuff, there are shops on the way with super cheap stuff outside. I saw jackets for as little as 15,000 won and pants for 10,000. As others have mentioned, there are food stands and restaurants on the way as well, or you could pack your own food and bring some makgeolli (or buy some there) and picnic like the locals! Entry is a meager 1,000 won. Allow yourself 3-4 hours if you intend to climb all the way up and enjoy the surroundings. Make sure you are in ok shape before you go and bring water or buy some on the way because, although the mountain isn't huge, there are some fairly steep areas and you may need to take a break or two to catch your breath and hydrate. This is a wonderful experience and I especially highly recommend it to anyone in the area!"
"Bit of a trek to get to, but worth it","A buddy and I went to hike up Mt. Soyosan one weekend and I got the opportunity to check out Chajaeam Temple while I was there. If you get dropped off by taxi it is a bit of a walk until you get to the trails up the mountain. There's not really a whole lot to do once you get there considering that it is a place of worship, but there is a small little souvenir stand where you can buy little nicknacks that aren't even Korean in origin I don't think. I think to get into the area it costs about 1,000 won ($1 roughly). If you decide to hike the mountain you will find some amazing views and even some old bunkers and fighting positions from the Korean War. I highly enjoyed it and I would recommend it to anyone."
"amazing ancient buddhist temple in amazing, yet accessible, mountain location","Soyosan is an amazing mountain hiking experience and Jajaem Temple is one of the first things you get to from where you start at the bottom. It's an ancient Buddhist temple, hundreds of years old although it was of course rebuilt several times, most recently after the Korean war. There are various temple complexes and a shrine occupying a cave in the mountainside right next to one of the breathtakingly beautiful waterfalls that the mountain is known for. There is an area outside the shrine to make offerings with water and candles and so on, and I believe monks currently live here and worship and maintain the area. In any event, you will see monks. The normal way to get here is to park at the base of the mountain, which you'll pay a couple thousand won for (about two dollars) and then I think once you start walking up the road that goes up the mountain you have to pay another thousand won per person to gain access to the temple complex. I don't think it's exactly wheelchair accessible, but the entire area and climbing experience is full of very sturdily built stairs so it's definitely a very approachable climb up to the temple area. There is also a small Buddhist shrine near another waterfall that you'll pass getting up to the main temple complex, and then right after Jajaem temple is the rocky stairway that leads up to the trails that go to Soyosan's peaks. If your thing is just checking out ancient Buddhist temples and enjoying the peace and mystery and atmosphere, I would still recommend paying the entrance fees to get in, because it's worth it, and there are also many great restaurants and street vendors and so on around this area when the weather is good. But if you are fairly fit and can handle lots of stair climbing and some scrabbling around and up rocky paths, I would strongly recommend taking three hours or so to visit at least the nearest, shortest of Soyosan's peaks before leaving. The entire mountain is breathtakingly beautiful, especially in the fall when the leaves are changing, but if you can only make it to the temple complex, it's worth a trip just for that."
