passing through,Busy airport but the departure and arrival desks have people that speak Englich and there are plenty of places to grab a bite to eat.
Airport ,"The airport is very clean and calm. Make sure you fill out an arrival card before you go to the arrivals desk and then a customs declaration card, even if you have nothing to declare, before you go out the exit. Say hi to the robots too!"
Domestic Lounge,"The KAL (Korean Air Lines) have quit their partnership with Priority Pass so they wouldn’t let us in even though we were flying Korean Air and have Amex Platinum. From the looks of it, we weren’t missing much. "
