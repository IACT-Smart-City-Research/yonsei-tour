Beautiful autumn leaves,Good simple stroll from the main township through a park by the stream. Riding a bike would be cool too. Weekends can be crowded.
Historical site about Danjong,"CYC ( 2013.08.02 ) There was a place with sad story about Danjong who was misfortune in history. The 6th King, Danjong, was expelled and killed by his uncle, 7th King Sejo. He was killed only 17 years old, before killing he have lived here about 3 years. This site was a good place for historical site. But there was not to meet my expectation. Big pine tree, Danjong's house, observatory is worthing to see without much expectation."
