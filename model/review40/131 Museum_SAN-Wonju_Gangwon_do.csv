It seems like every corner is an oeuvre.And if you like taking photo then you shouldn't miss this amazing museum.There are 3 theme gardens here. First is Flower garden in full blossom, the next one is Water Garden where a dazzling display of water reflects the surroundings, and finally Ando Tadao's Stone Garden featuring nine stone mounds inspired by ancient Silla tombs.[Museum Ticket] Adults 28,000 won / Students (elementary, middle, high school students) 18,000 won[Gallery Ticket] Adults 15,000 won / Students (elementary, middle, high school students) 10,000 wonFollow my IG for more korea travel spots IG@Ngocanhcrystal"
Loved this place,"Very peaceful and beautiful place to visit. They also have a coffee shop where you can relax during your visit. Make sure to go to special exhibitions too, as they are an amazing experience. The entrance fee is quite high though"
Best of the best.,The most beautiful place of Korea.Good for enjoy the nature and transitional and mordern art.The park is wonderful.Entrance is expensive.I recommend here for the every age people.
힐링하기 좋은 곳/Nice place to feel korea.,오크밸리 안에 있으면서 아주 조용하고 흥미로운 장소입니다. 입장료가 비싸고 미취학아동은 제임스터렐전을 볼수 없다는 아쉬움이 있지만 방문할 가치는 있습니다.It's a nice place to look james turrell's master piece
Museum SAN must be seen,"We came there and thought as amazing it might be how can it rival the museums of NY. But it was more than NY can be with the structure into the hills, the pools of water.. There was a video sculpture Nam June Paik - an artist I know (as a university kid hanging out) it was there... It was so amazing. Please go here sit in the outdoor cafe drink coffee by the pool, gaze on the valley. "
Surprisingly Quality Museum! Must see! ,"This museum is a real treasure and absolutely worth the time to visit. The facility and more importantly the permanent exhibitions are all too notch. By far the most artistically fulfilling exhibition is the James Terrell permanent exhibition, 100% worth the extra ticket price and wait. One of the best James Terrell exhibitions that I have seen personally. The other galleries are also good and insightful, featuring the thoughtful Paper Gallery, to the other galleries featuring well known contemporary Korean artists. Beautiful cafe over looking the mountains and breath taking gardens. Was truly surprised by the quality of this museum. "
Refreshing and Intriguing,"This museum was a breath of fresh air during the hot and humid summer. Although there was a bit of a walk to get to the museum, the sights and sounds of the trees, flowers, the breeze, and sculptures made the stroll quite pleasant during the unpleasant weather. I'm not that interested in history so the portion of the museum about paper-making only captured a part of my attention. The other galleries within the museum however were beautiful and interesting even for a non-museum lover. The architecture of the building was amazing and the view outside was spectacular. I highly recommend this museum to everyone in the area."
Must Go!,"Museum SAN is an awesome place to visit! I love how the architectural style of the museum plays well with the surrounding landscape. I'm quite sad that I only had an hour to spend there, but I am for sure going back in the near future. I recommend this place to everyone."
Unique and Beautiful,"My first time came to this museum, it has large complex, the building and style are modern and unique. From the history of paper, art painting and the exquisite James Turrel imagination. A new experience for seeing this. It's lot of fun with groups. Grade 7,5 out of 10"
Amazing Exceptional Museum,"For Art Lovers (particularly contemporary art) this is a must see place in Asia. Starting with the location and the architecture, continuing with the artworks everything is outstanding. The building has a clear marked design of Tadao Ando and it's wonderful, in line with all other building that this Japanses architect has built. The buildings, the small lake, the park, everything is exceptional. The artworks inside the building are not very much but all of them of excellent quality. Particularly we liked the light works of J. Turrel, a very exciting experiente (note that you have specific guided tours of no more than 20 people, at definite times) do not miss it."
Go without driving,"It is a nice museum as all other reviews mentioned. I am sharing how we went there without driving. You will need to go to Seoul express bus terminal subway station, then go up to the bus terminal for bus tickets going to Wonju. Bus schedule to Wonju is pretty frequent (around 10-15 mins each) and you can check online in Kobus official site (with English schedule information ). It takes 1.5 hours to arrive Wonju express bus terminal. There are 2 types of bus ticket price based on comfort level and we bought the general type (7100 Krw each) since it's cheaper and departure time is good for us. From the Museum San website, it tells you that you can take free shuttle bus (in Wonju) by Oak Valley. However the schedule is not frequent and we did not know which bus is the one. We took taxi directly to the museum and it costs us 22000 krw and arrived around 15 - 20 mins.On the way back, we took the Oak Valley free shuttle bus back to Wonju express bus terminal. Remember to ask the staff for the shuttle bus schedule since it's different with the schedule in museum website. There is no 'bus stop' outside the museum and you can simply wait for the bus next to the road. The shuttle bus took 1 hour to arrive Wonju bus station.Hopefully information above helps anyone who want to visit the museum but struggling how to go there without driving. :)一一一一一一一一一一一一一一一一一一一一一一一一一一一一一一一一一一一一一一一一一一一一一一一一一一一一一一一一一一一一一"
Wonderful Museum SAN,"The Museum SAN is absolutely stunning! I was looking for some sort of good and memorable place where I could go with my children. Plus I wanted a place where is in nature so that I could leave a busy and complicated city for a while. This museum is the one that I was looking for! It is surrounded by nature and has three amazing gardens (flower, water, and stone), architecture, and James Turrell’s works. My family’s favorite space is the WATER GARDEN! Its clean water surrounds the museum and a huge red sculpture just looks like floating on the water. I was so surprised that Wonju has this kind of amazing place! I really recommend you to visit this place indeed. :D"
Completely a different experience,"We went in a group, its little away from thee city with a heavenly scenic view. You must understand the concept of theoretical architecture, It cannot be explained but be experienced. Modern architecture mixed with divine life. Unfortunately we went in the end of winter so we couldn't see the flowers. There is a cafeteria and we were hosted an official dinner it was splendid."
Best Museum I've Visited,All i can say is the museum is really amazing with its landscape and great view of nature! but it requires car to reach there.
A great museum to enjoy the nature and art,"Located at the top of the mountain, I had enjoyed the exhibits and also the spectacular view of nature beauty."
"Excellent Museum, Difficult to Reach (via public trans)","PROS:- The museum grounds and buildings are well-made and quite scenic.- The exhibits/galleries are well-curated.- James Turrell exhibit is excellent.CONS:- Difficult to reach via public transportation. There is a shuttle from Wonju Bus Station, but it does not run very frequently. Be prepared to spend the majority of the day going to the museum.NOTES:- The shuttle stops in front of the Intercity Bus Terminal. The bus stop does not have any signage for the shuttle. Look for a charter bus that goes to Oak Valley. - I do not believe there was English translation for all the art/items displayed.- Admission - W 28,000 for admission to the museum and the James Turrell exhibit. W 15,000 for admission to the museum only.- James Turrell Exhibit: Groups of 28 are let in every 30 minutes. The guided exhibit runs approx. 30 min. My guides only spoke Korean throughout, I do not know if an English guide is available. - There is a cafe at the museum serving drinks and bingsoo. Food/meal options are not available. Coffee is also available in the entrance building. It is cheaper there (W3500 for Americano) than at the museum cafe (W6000 for Americano)."
THE most beautiful combination of design and exhibit EVER.,"We were in Wonju visiting family. We have been to the area before but there is so much new construction and expansion going on in anticipation of the 2018 Olympic games.This museum is located above Wonju and somewhat out of town but very easy to get to by car. I think there is bus service as well, not sure. But however you can, if you are anywhere nearby, do not miss this glorious place. The pictures on the internet cannot do it justice and the collection of Paper art is spectacular. The holigraphic display in the lobby is mezmerising. The James Turrell exhibit building is wonderful! The exhibit of his work is guided. We did not speak Korean but the young people got out their translator apps and made a real effort. They succeeded wonderfully and maybe better because we were surprised more than those who had the lecture. We loved it so much.This is on my Favorite places list!"
Amazing museum in an amazing setting,"I went with friends to the MuseumSan. The drive is just lovely, through the mountains and past fields. The large stone building, surrounded by stone walls reminds me of fortresses from the Korean past. The Turrell exhibit is well worth the extra expense. It really engages all senses, though the walk to it from the main building is a bit long. The sculptures along the way are world class.The building is a bit of a maze by another starchitect of museum architecture. One spends more time walking around and between the galleries than in the galleries themselves, experiencing the feeling of the stone and glass building.I was with a Korean friend who explained Korean modern art history. I wish more didactic information could have enlightened me.The café is a nice rest, whether outside next to the Stone Garden or inside.For those averse to the sun, complimentary umbrellas are provided!Well worth the trip"
A beautiful countryside museum,"I’ve visited this museum a few times with my family, and have enjoyed it every time. The museum is designed by world-famous Tadao Ando and is located within Oak Valley golf/ski resort. Because of its countryside location, natural surroundings, and sheer size, the venue really differentiates itself from other art museums in Korea, which are typically small and located in urban areas. The museum is divided into three parts: the flower garden, the water garden (where the actual exhibition is held), and the stone garden (where James Turrell works are located). The entrance fee is 12000 won for adults and 7000 won for kids. James Turrell Exhibition is another 15000 / 10000, adult/kids. It is open from 10:30 to 6 (ticket office closes at 5) everyday except for Monday. Because the museum is almost half outdoor and half indoor, you should try to avoid cold winter season. Also, because the museum is so large and takes a lot of walking to view the whole thing (takes about 1~2 hours), wearing comfortable shoes is essential.In terms of its art collection, the museum prominently features modern Korean artworks. While the collection has some great names, it is nothing new compared with those of other galleries in Seoul. However, the highlight really is the Tadao Ando architecture itself, and the James Turrell piece, which requires additional charge to view. It is definitely one of a kind in Korea, definitely worth a visit. (I hear the Turrell piece is under renovation until March 2014) Visiting the venue can be sort of a pain unless you drive. It takes about 1.5 hours from Seoul by car. In case you don't drive, you can take a bus to Wonju, then take Oak Valley shuttle bus, which will drop you off right in front of the museum. There is a cafe inside the museum where the food is decent, as well as other restaurants (Korean and Western) within the resort property. If you are looking for the best art collection in Korea, this may not be the place to visit. However, it is definitely one of a kind museum that presents both beautiful natural landscape and world-class architecture, which can be enjoyed by every member of the family."
