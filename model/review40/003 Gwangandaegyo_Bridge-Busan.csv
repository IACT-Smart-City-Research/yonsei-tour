So prettyyyyyy!!,My friend fell in love at first sight. The night view is A-M-A-Z-I-N-G. Highly recommend for a night stroll!!
Beautifully lit up at night,We stayed in a hotel with a view of the bridge and we loved seeing it and enjoyed the light show too!
At night lights up ,"The bridge looks great at night time, there are various look out points you can. Go to to get some great photos "
Great Night View,Was from Gwanggali Beach and opposite is the nice view of the bridge.It is better during sunset and when the lights are on. Simply beautiful. Enjoyed the night walk here.
It’s a nice bridge,"It’s a nice bit of architecture, and to be fair you can see it from almost anywhere in Busan. The Hop On/Off tour bus crosses it twice on its city route but ferry terminal observation deck has best unobstructed view for pics."
Beautiful place,It was very beautiful at night. It's quite difficult to find because I'm lost. There are many BBQ restaurants and they are good. 
A great construction - a nice Busan landmark,"Nice view from the port or tower, Gamcheon village. It is a real lamndmark of Busan. Nice view as well from the terrace of the Lotte mall in the sea port."
Amazing views,If you're afraid of heights stay away but the views are fantastic. There is a toll charge but a few $. It's worth the view of the city.
Very beautiful ,This double deck bridge can get busy at rush hour but it is very nice to visit over night time. Great piece of engineering. 
Beautiful sight and place to spend a few hours,Didn’t anticipate the uniqueness this site offers. Went down to beach for dinner and a walk and was happily surprised by the light show on the bridge. A must-do. Don’t miss it. 
Mesmerizing view,"I have visited gwangandaegyo bridge in three ways: view of Gwangwalli beach, walked over the bridge during an event and from a ferry ride, and it has mesmerized me in all the ways. definitely must watch at night or a foggy morning. This is also the host of Busan Fire Festival which again makes it a must visit."
Very nice at night ,"It can be part of one day plan. You can swim all day at gwangalli beach. You can eat your dinner over there. There are so many restaurants and pubs. During your dinner, you can enjoy gwangan bridge’s view"
Gorgeous,"Good view of the hills and seas. The spiral loop that goes on to it had me amazed. They do charge a toll fee. If you take a taxi, it will be added manually at the end to the fare. Keep track of how much the toll is. We took taxi everywhere as it was cheaper and more advantageous for a group of three. Usually it evens out to the metro price. Tipping aren't necessary. Drivers are honest. They don't speak much English so have your translator app ready! Destinations in Korean are more helpful. "
Night View,"Visit at night for the light show, not very interesting but can be quite calming looking at it. Not very long "
A cool bridge to cross,"Gwangan bridge is one of the longest and iconic bridges at Busan and a cool bridge to cross anytime. Express intra city buses like 1006, 1011 cross the bridge as part of their travel route in case you feel interested to cross over the bridge by public transport. Great views from the bridge. You can visit gwangalli beach as well for a great view of the bridge from shore."
Cool bridge,Pretty impressive bridge in Busan. Stands out a fair bit and multiple vantage points sprints the city to see it. Crossed a few times while traveling around the city. 
Nice beach,I go there with my husband and my baby .She love this beach with many friendly people .There are alot of restaurant and shop. It worth for visit there.
Night yacht tour to view the Gwangan Bridge,"Well...I've been to busan a couple of times and everytime I see the Gwangan bridge, it's from Gwangalli beach. But this time, I went on a night yacht tour to see the gwangan bridge from the sea! It was really mesmerising!!!! Love it!Watch my video of the yacht tour on my Instagram @xuantravelogue"
Beautiful lit up,"It's just a bridge most of the time, still neat architecture, but the real beauty is at night when they light it up and have a light show on it. Going over it is fairly fun, but traffic in Korea tends to be an adventure on its own....Would recommend going over the bridge then making sure to get to Gwangalli Beach in the evening to catch it lit up as well. Very nice beach with markets and restaurants aplenty as well. Make sure your camera is ready."
Wow what a bridge!!,"Absolutely loved this bridge, it's actually really cool. We took the subway line 2 to Gwangan and then followed the signs to walk towards the beach and you see the bridge from there. There are lots of restaurants and cafes and lots going on. I loved this area. At night the bridge was lit up with lots of colours and there were some fireworks being set off from boats. It's really nice! A must see in Busan for sure."
Romantic beach with the bridge view,The beach is very lovely. There're some restaurant and cafe along the beach. The view of the bridge and the ocean at dawn was so romantic. The bridge will be light up at night time. It's an instagram hot spot which you shouldn't miss to stop taking some pictures.
A double trip on the Bridge without paying a toll,"We went over the bridge twice as part of the hop on bue route.The swoop up the spptoach ramps was exciting, almost like a theme park ride. Especially when you sit on an isle set on the bus and dont see the crash rails!"
Great View,Amazing night view! We took a night cruise and was able to view the bridge lights being turned on. Later we took a short hike and the bridge lights was still amazing across Busan. 
The best bridge ever,"This was the best bridge I have ever seen in my life, and I’ve seen a good many bridges. The light show was spectacular and the panoramic of the bridge and the skyline from Gwangalli Beach was absolutely gorgeous. Go for the sunset, enjoy some food at one of the seaside restaurants, and take it all in. The world needs more bridges like Gwangandaegyo."
Love a good bridge ,Busan is home to various types of bridges. As we had a car we had the delight of driving over most of them - including this one! A great piece of engineering. A very comfortable and spacious bridge. Loved seeing it lit up at night time.
You can get very good impressions and let you hair down. You can enjoy the view of the bridge from Gwangalli beach,Recommend to go with your family or friends. Some festivals are held in here. The view of the city looks amazing in that place
A light show ,We did not drive on this bridge but it is a nice place to go see at night since the bridge lights up with many different colours. A nice sight to see. 
Magnificent ,Magnificent and beautiful view And there are many restaurants and bars and cafes I really recommend for you!
Great view of the bridge lazer lighting after 1930 pm,Great place to watch the scenic bridge view. Try to grab a seat at any of the rooftop cafe / restaurants at Gwangangali Beach for a great view while having your meals. 
Fantastic,"Also known as the Diamond Bridge, it has the greatest number of LED lights at night. Opened in 2003, it’s the Golden Gate Bridge of Busan. It is the second largest suspension in South Korea. It can be viewed from the Observatory, along the coastal walk around Dobgbaek Island, or an evening night tour on the Busan City Bus tour. I heard that October would be the best time to see the lit bridge as it’s Busan’s International Fireworks Festival. "
Nice place ,"After 4 pm is the best time reccommend to visit here and stay there till sun set. There are lots of people there, together with there puppies. "
Great ,A beautiful bridge especially at night. Bridge changes colors at night and is quite interesting to see. 
Cannot miss seeing this as stands out!!!!,Yes as said you will definitely see this when in Busan as it is so large and prominent that it is iconic for the areaYes I am sure that some will say but it is only a bridge - how many do you know that are this large and show up so well against the skyline of the city 
excellent sight,excellent sight specially when is all lit up at night with a great walkway right on the beach for a stroll and clicking some great pics
It is a 1000k bridge,Very pretty. Took a cab to get onto the bridge and have to pay toll fees haha... Please catch nightly light show from the beach at a couple of timing every night.
ATTRACTION… THIS????,"Nice bridge, yes… but, look, this is a “BRIDGE” with a nice view. Where is the speciality?Honestly speaking, I can say that this is a passing through place, with nothing special. It is a BRIDGE… that is it.SOMETIMES, there is a “LIGHT SHOW”… but also, again, NOTHING special… I am sorry to say.This is no more than a 3 star classification, since there is nothing special about this.DO SOMETHING special with your time, and give this a miss… you will NOT miss something special, believe me."
One of the attraction,"The Gwangandaegyo or Diamond Bridge is a suspension bridge located in Busan, South Korea and is 7.4km from Namcheon-dong (Suyeong-gu, Busan) to Centum City (U-dong, Haeundae-gu). It is picturistic spot"
Busan's representative landmark,"This bridge is Busan's representative landmark. It is beautiful during the day, but the lights on the bridge at night are more beautiful. A fireworks festival is held every October."
Amazing,"I booked a room at Hyatt with the bridge view.I enjoyed every single second day and night, the view was breathtaking."
Spectacular ,The Gwangandaegyo or Diamond Bridge is the second longest in South Korea. It is spectacular and the middle bit looks slightly like the Anzac Bridge in Sydney. It is particularly good when lit up at night
Busan,The bridge is spectacular both during the day and at night a great fete of engineering and a great landmark in Busan worth a visit
This is very picturesque bridge and construction marvel,"Very picturesque and beautiful. normally when one goes from airport to City side, one has to cross this bridge. Much attractive."
Enjoy a cold beer and sunset.,"Tremendous lightshow on the bridge @ 8, 9, 10 pm. What a great view from LA Bar and Grill's cozy window seating area. Have a cold beer or glass of wine while watching the bridge's digital lightshow. Very cool!"
Diamond Bridge,"We planned our visit to Gwangalli Beach in the evening to enjoy the beach and also enjoy the view of Gwangandaegyo Bridge in the night. Though it was very cold and windy ,the clean beach and the view compensated for it. The children had their day playing on the beach while we enjoyed the view of the electrified bridge which is the second longest bridge in Korea spanning over 7.4 km."
HOW TO ENJOY THE BRIDGE THAT WILL DRIVE YOUR DUDE OR BIRD CRAZY,1. Take a taxi acorss the bridge day or night.2. Twice nightly light show from the beach3. Eat raw fish and soju and look at the bridge.4. Enjoy the weekend night market in the summer.
Gwangali beach,Visited Gwangali beach just to get an idea of beach culture in Busan. The beach is very clean and affords a fantastic view of Gwangandaegyo bridge. There's nothing much to do though. Clicked a few pictures and left. Spent about 15 min at the beach. 
Bars with a view,"During my trip in Korea I did not see a lot of bars where you can have a beer.However, in this part of town, there quite a few ones where you can enjoy your alcoholic beverage while admiring the enlightenend and colorfull bridge. But let's be clear, it is not more then just a bridge with lights. I had more fun of my beer."
Beautiful bridge ,During my trip in Busan I had the chance to see this bridge by night. It was colofull some days before the famous Fireworks. 
Diamond Bridge,You get a good view of Diamond bridge at Gwangalli beach. Go in the evening to watch the light display on Diamond bridge.
Otherwise known as the Diamond Bridge (locally).,The best time to see this bridge is actually at night! The bridge is completely lit up at night with a large variety of lights and patterns. Best place to view the bridge at night is at the Gwangalli Beach.
Hot Place,This sight can be seen in Gwangali beach. I bet its more beautiful at night! Make sure to got to beaches too.
Gorgeous!,Utterly beautiful bridge spanning over the bay. Apparently fireworks are shot off the bridge during holidays. Massive event. We went across while doing the City bus tour
Its a bridge,"Crossed this 4 times, good views and believe longest suspension bridge in Asia. You get a real feel for how busy Busan is as a working international port, with all the shipping and cranes"
Very Pretty At Night,It sets a pretty backdrop for some nice photo shoots. Go at night cos it is rather nondescript in the daytime but once lit it rivals Golden Gate.
Night view of bridge not so impressive,Highly priased venue for night scene. Personally I beg to differ as the light is not that glamorous. 
Great view at night,The view at night is breath taking . It is a must see place . Better at night when the weather is clear . Fun for ALL .
Spectacular ...,".... views at night, with a lot of light shows that can be watched from numerous restaurants or bars. During the day, just another Bridge."
A bridge,"We didn't get an opportunity to walk on the bridge. It was seen from afar and it was not much different from most bridges that span across a body of water. If we have viewed the structure at night, I might rate it higher by a notch."
Another Lighted up Bridge,"I had high hopes at this place. But was pretty disappointed. It is basically a bridge that is being lit up and a few variations and patterns. But i must say, it can be romantic to sit by the beach and watch it with your loved ones."
HUGE!,We took a taxi over this bridge and its as amazing! So many things happening below on the water and the streets!
The Never Ending Bridge,I am very impressed by how long this bridge is & it's specatacular to watch it from afar. At night they will be shows & lights on it. Simply amazing 
Well designed bridge--special sight that is worth your time,"As bridges go, this is a good one! The design is great and the site location is beautiful. You are going to see a lot of great bridges if you get to Japan & South Korea, but this is one of the good ones! When compared to the US, they are ""way ahead of us!"" A well designed bridge can really set a city apart from all others. We need to get more of our city planners to look at what can be done with a decent bridge!"
"Gwangandaegyo Bridge, Busan, South Korea","We navigated under the bridge when arriving in the port of Busan. Architectural beautiful land a fantastic piece of engineering !As we did later on a citytour, we passed this time over the bridge with our bus and were again impressed by its beauty."
Perfect sight during the night,The lights that illuminate the bridge becomes a good background for you to take your picture. There's this thing where you can take a picture of yourself with the bridge in your background and you can have the picture sent to your email so you can have a copy for yourself.
Just a bridge lit in the night,"The advertised laser shows did not happen when I went on a Sunday evening. However the nearby Gwangalli beach was very crowded with cultural shows, cafes, shops."
Cool to see at night,This bridge lights up at night and it is cool to see if you are by the shore. I wouldn't make a special trip to see it though.
Better view from Haeundae,"You can get better view of Gwangan Bridge from Haeundae. Both of my best photos of the bridge are taken there(especially Busan Hyatt Park Hotel). Also, it's recommendable to visit the place in the nighttime. Walk along the beach and feel refreshing cool wind. Haeundae Cinema Road is another good point to appreciate Gwangan Bridge. Here is less crowded than Gwangan-Li."
Visually Pleasing and Scenically Charming,We can see the bridge clearly from our hotel. It bridge looks very pretty during the day and also the evening. Busan is a beautiful city and the bridges add to the city’s charm. 
Incredible Place!,Being on a short trip from a cruise - it was wonderful to be able to see Busan. It was quite amazing and the bridge looked beautiful in daylight and in the evening. There are some breathtaking bridges in Busan - as surprising as the place is - would happily return.
Site of Black Panther movie ,We took an evening to visit to see the light show at 8pm and based ourselves inside a cafe along the Gwangalli bridge. A nice view and enjoyed the novelty of being in vicinity of the scenes shot for Black Panther movie. The light show as some have said is rather boring after the first 5 mins. 
Beautiful Bridges in Busan,The bridges in Busan are beautiful. I was luck to be on a cruise and able to capture this night shot of one of on the bridges.
Beautiful bridge,"I saw this bridge both from a distance and up close. We went there during the dark, and the ambience was just really good. It was a very pretty bridge, and the lights made it even better."
Hot spot!,You must enjoy the beauty with your own eyes that is impossible to capture on a camera. Skyline and Kwangan Bridge are beautiful beyond description. Not all can be expressed in the camera.
Two storied,I liked this bridge so much that I went over it 4 times. There and back to get a different view and take different photos. It was smoggy so the photos are not so clear but the experience was great. The panorama view of the high rises is quite impressive just like HK but a more interesting design of buildings. From the park looking out over it I decided to call it “silver gate bridge” as the two silver structural towers seemed to rise out of the smog like SF.
Bridge,"4.2 km long.What else can be said about a bridge. It is not high, there is no nice view, it offers a fast connection to Haeundae that is all.Probably I will use it again..."
Long bridge,This bridge is deceptive. It is the longest bridge in Korea but doesn't look it initially. When you drive along it then solves the puzzle as the elevated aproaches then solves the puzzle. They are very long and seem to be longer than the central span.
Very long bridge,"If you like architecture and bridges you should see this one. It is a very long bridge. You could see it from my hotel, the Park Hyatt. "
Not that special,"It is a nice view at night, but I do not think it is worth the effort to specially go to it. It is a little walk from the nearest metro."
Beutiful bridge and experience local youth culture,"Went to this bridge after we went to a late night eel binge.We though there are only a few people there eating pajeon and drinking soju, but how wrong are we.on the small park under the bridge there are hundres and hundres of youth sitting on mats, each are having their own private party.so needles to say, we get a spot, bought a few soju bottles, some pajeon an joining in the fun. one of my best night in busan.Just a note, toilet queue can be a little long, and train ceased after 1."
Its impressive at night with the lights on,"We were introduce to visit this place from the tourist book. The lights really looks a a gem in the night. With the whole bridge light up. The beach area was with no crowd in the chill weather of the month. However, it definitely is a good spot for summer goers."
Longest Suspension Bridge in Korea,"We were walking around Haeundae which had very good views of Gwangandaegyo Bridge. If you go in the morning, there is good lighting from Haeundae to take pictures of the bridge."
Beautiful at night,The South Koreans are very proud of this bridge which can be seen from much of the city. In October there are fireworks from the bridge. However any night the bridge lights up and makes for a beautiful spectacle.
See it lit up at night.,Drive over it in the top of the city tour bus in the summer is a great experience. Watch it light up from Gwangam beach from a little restaurant. Participate in the bridge run. Catch a glimpse of it in more and more movies as an iconic site of Busan.
Come for the fireworks festival at the end of October.,"The bridge has lights built in. Those were coordinated with the fireworks and music! Fantastic show! It is a lovely bridge at any time, but basically it is a bridge, though a very nice one.. No wonder they're so proud of it."
"Its A bridge. ok but ,,,",You can see it from all over the city. It did nothing for us it is just a bridge after all. At night they have colored lights. Really it is a bit of an eye sore too dominant on the skyline.
Beautiful to sail under,Our cruise ship sailed under the bridge on our Busan stop and it was fun to watch it change colors in the darkness.
This is a beautiful bridge,"I’ve crossed this bridge several times when visiting Pusan. It is beautiful by day and especially by night. You do not have to be an engineer to appreciate it. Unfortunately, by driving across it, you really do not get a very good view."
Most Fascinating Bridge I've Been On,Beats the Millau Bridge in France hands down. This artwork in concrete as well as its accompanying approaches is mindboggling to traverse. There are spirals of concrete ramps entering and leaving almost all along the way. Looking at it doesn't do it justice: ride over it.
Pretty beach,We can view the bridge from our Airbnb but we also walked to the beach to get a closer look as well. Changing lights at night entertained the kids. 
Drivers point of view...,"Good shortcut. If you drive in parallel on shore it might take significantly longer. 1000 won (~0.9 USD) road fee is OK. On peak time in morning and afternoon the exit from beige get busy, especially towards Bexco/Haeundae or Ulsan.Once a year three is a marathon that includes the bridge, then you can walk over it. If you follow the road west-bound there comes in about 2 km the Busan Harbour Bridge that is much more spectacular lighten in the night."
Best viewed at night!,"The Gwangandaegyo or Diamond Bridge is a suspension bridge located in Busan, South Korea. It connects Haeundae-gu to Suyeong-gu. It is the second longest bridge in the country after the Incheon Bridge. This is an architectural marvel, and is best viewed at night when it is lit up like a Xmas tree. Construction began in 1994 and concluded in December 2002, with a total cost of 789.9 billion won"
It's ok..,"We went there at night. We read about coloured light show on the bridge at night, but was quite disappointed when we didn't really see as we expected. There was a concert though at the Gwanggalli Beach where we can see this bridge, as well as many eating areas, cafes and restaurants around the area which compensates for the bridge highlight disappointments."
Just cars,"I tried to cross this bridge by foot, but it is not designed for that. Luckily someone gave me a lift to the other side - thank's for that again mate! However it lost some magic to me, I wanted to make some photos there as well, but I get it, that would be considered dangerous. Otherwise well...it's a bridge...look quite nice though."
Night Light Show,This bridge have spectacular light show with music and green laser. Its better if you bring tripod to make good picture and video
"Yep, its a bridge","And it does its job as a bridge very well. Gets you from A to B without getting your feet wet. I have been over it in Taxi's and the tour bus, all successful. It is lit up nicely at night so if you have a clear night (often) then photos from the beach. I am not sure if you can walk across the bridge, but it would be quite a walk if you can."
Fantastic night view,wonderful night view with a sting of tasty pub and tasty restaurant.I highly recommend to visit when you come to Busan.
Nice long bridge,"We went to Gwangalli beach and had a very good view of this bridge. It was fairly long and you can view this bridge from many points along the coast but we found the best view from Gwangalli beach. The bridge is often referred to as the Gwangan bridge or Diamond bridge. If you come at night, you may be able to see it lit up by LED lights. If you come towards the end of October, you may be lucky enough to see the Busan Fireworks Festival around this bridge."
Awesome night view!,"I visited Gwangalli Beach in order to look at this bridge. I came here at midnight and there were still loads of people hanging around. There were lights all over the bridge and it was truly beautiful to look at it at night. People were playing with fireworks and everyone is welcomed to play with it, just remember to keep yourself and others safe. There are loads of restaurants and bars along the beach as well. Definitely recommend visiting this place for a great night view."
Check It Out From DongBaekSeom,"GwangAn Bridge is an expansive and very impressive bridge. I wish I had the opportunity to get in a car and drive on the bridge itself but I didn't have the opportunity to do that (and I heard it's ridiculously long).So I did the next best thing and went to DongBaekSeom Island to capture its beauty. The bridge is quite beautiful and you'll get the perfect backdrop of it with the ocean and APEC House nearby. So if you want that close up view without having to actually be on it, this island is your best bet.NOTE: I also heard it's very beautiful at night when it's all lighted up so make sure and check the schedule if you're able to enter this island at night for that awesome night time view. Enjoy!"
long bridge in busan,"Gwangalli Beach overlooks Gwangan Bridge which provides a backdrop for the day. It is the largest bridge over water in South Korea, stretching from Namcheon to Centum City in U-dong. As the sun sets at night, the night lights create a spectacular view."
The longest bridge ,"You can see this bridge from gwangan beach or heaundea beach. In the night, you can see bridge of light. You should see it! "
Impressive Bridge with Beautiful Night View,The bridge looks very nice as you drive by the beach or over the bridge itself during the day. The top level is for one direction and the bottom level is for the other direction. As nice as it looks by day the night view is a really impressive. They light up the bridge periodically change colors creating a beautiful night view.
What a Beautiful Bridge,The most beautiful bridge i ever seen so far. The view is just stunning. You have to visit this place when you are in Busan.
Stunning,You don't have much choice in seeing this bridge if you stain Haeundea Beach. You have to cross it to get to either the airport or the train station. It's also prominent on the boat tours from that beach area.
Great views,Great views off the bridge and at the bridge from the beach. I especially liked hanging out on Gwangali beach in the evening and enjoying my views of the bridge changing into variety of pastel colors. So pretty. You can also take cool architectural shots of the bridge while on the bridge.
Perfect for sunset,"As much as we enjoyed Haeundae, this was definitely the better beach- not as busy, beautiful views and as the sun set and all the lights came on on the bridge and nearby buildings it was a great spot to relax with friends."
Lights Up,"I didn't travel on the bridge itself, but it lights up at night and provides a great photo opporunity."
First time drive!,"I drove my first time by this bridge with my friend. I was impressed. Bridge is 2 level. Upper level all roads go on one way, down one, another way. There is no change for cars which go at different way to meet at the same level. Its nice idea! :)"
What is this bridge for? ,"Watching many night shots of the ridge, I finally crossed it by cab on my way from the airport to the hotel. One can see a number of box apartments and a desolate beach in front of them against the backdrop of low green mountains. This bridge is only for ameliorate the heavy traffic with the damaging view of the residents near the beach. I do not know whether Busanians are fond of or proud of this bridge."
Beautiful night view!,"This is pretty in the day, but amazing at night. I think it's the best night view in Busan. I would definitely visit Gwangalli at night, bring some food and enjoy this view."
Gwangandaegyo Bridge,"At night, we saw the bridge with its multicolored lights. It's awesome! We saw it at close range because we had the Tiffany 21 night cruise and we also saw it from the top of the Hwangnyeongsan mountain. You can see the whole span of the bridge with its changing, dancing colors from the top of the mountain. It's something unforgettable. Very good background for picture taking also. The bridge is somewhat similar to the shape of the Golden Gate bridge of San Francisco, USA."
Bridge that lights up!,This bridge is best seen from the nearby beach where the bridge lights up and messages are scrolled across it. Great viewing from the nearby beach.
Lovely at night and combine with cinema visit,We took the metro line 2 to Geumnyeonsan (exit 5) enjoyed a couple craft beers and some food at Galemegi Brewing Co then walked 2 minutes around the corner to enjoy the view of this wonderful bridge illuminated at night. Consider continuing on to Centum a City (exit 12) to see the cinema centre which has a lightning display until 0300. Enjoy.Thanks for the vote if you found this review helpful.
Nice view,"I was visiting with a friend in the afternoon, the view is quite nice but a little bit windy in the area. There is a shop called Orangebada near the beach which sells beautiful postcard and other handmade products. There are also many restaurant, bar and coffee shop nearby, which let you enjoy the spectacular view or the bridge."
Be sure to see it from the beach where you can hear the music with the lights,"It is a beautiful bridge and the view of it from the beach is very photogenic. When it puts on it's light show, if you are on the beach near a speaker, the light show on the bridge bounces to the beat and mood of the song. So be sure to linger long enough for a song and light show to come on. If you are on the food and drinks side of the road, and the lights start. Cross the street to the beach side so you can hear the music."
Beautiful light show,Bridge is nice to look at as it puts up a light show. Not a must see but worth checking out when you are there. Lots of bars and restaurants on the beach front have a good view of it 
Great view,"One of Busan icon. Great place to take photograph especially during sunset and night with all the lights on. The place I visited , there are restaurant and you have your lunch or dinner and enjoy the spectacular view of the bridge. Quite romantic too."
"very solid bridge, well constructed, nice at night to see","no bumps in this bridge, well built, great to see at night,you can see this bridge at night from lotte gwangbok"
Interesting,"Beautiful architecture. This bridge is a few kilometers long and spans over the sea.Seen from the beach, it is an interesting sight ... especially at night. At night, enjoy the play of lights and their different colours. Whilst sitting on the beach or enjoying a meal/drink in one of the eateries found along the seaside, you'll be witness to the traffic jams on Friday nights and weekends. De-stress and enjoy the sight !"
Impressive ,A very impressive bridge. The second long bridge in South Korea. The trafic is going on two floors each floor to the other side
simple yet beautiful,"Just like any other bridge around the world, with the location and backdrop , looking good especially in the night with lights on."
Nice View!,Nice spot for photo shoot with skyscrapers including mountain as background. Taking photo at night is not that good because light is not enough and so dark so to make your shot perfect day time is the best.
Wow,Wow ... what else to say! This bridge is monument for Busan! 8 km length is surprising. Recomend to see bridge in night!
Over rated,"If i known better, I would give this a miss. The music light show was total disappointment. The lights are ok, but the music is close to non- existent given the people on the beach ""whispers"" louder than the music.The area offers the most BBQ restaurants in probably a single location so go for the food, leave out the bridge and especially the show."
Nice lighting at night,You can see the bridge from Gwangalli beach and it very nice when it lights up at night. It can be quite therapeutic just lying at the beach and looking at the changing lights of the bridge. 
Just a bridge with lights on.,"Starts the light show at 8:00pm and finishes at about 8:15, I think must be repeated several times,but am not sure. good to see from the Gwangan beach. But what I really enjoyed was the street performance of some old Korean singers and saxophones, they were really great! And the street from Subway to the beach is full of little shops and restaurants. So you can enjoy the view of the bridge, together with the street performances and then go to some restaurant to enjoy the korean bbq."
Nice Bridge by night,We were lucky enough to view this long suspension bridge by night time because our cruise left Busan very late. The bridge looked more attractive with full illumination.
Amazing loved it,we had a little time and were driving so did a bit of touring and this bridge was amazing but remember to have cash with you as there are tolls everywhere
Light show after 8pm and then every hour,Bridge light show on the hour every hour starting 8pm. The beach area to see the bridge was relaxing and peaceful at night. The light reflections off the buildings on the water made the night sparkle.Only went at night but can imagine a good picnic spot on the beach during the day. 
Beautiful visit day or night! ,Also known as the Diamond Bridge! This is a terrific drive if needed to get from A to B. To view the bridge best to do it from Marine City or Gwangali! Either night or day you will be in awe of this magnificent structure! 
Diamond Bridge,"The bridge is a beautiful sight to see from the beach, restaurants, etc. I did a little research & discovered it was the 2nd largest bridge in South Korea."
We visited this place on 30.04.2017,Very beautiful at nightespecially to take a picture. But in real it is so huge!! Omg!! We passed by car abt it's unbelievably big! And so beautiful! 
Nice bridge during the night with light show,Nice bridge during the night due to the light show.Surrounded by pretty night views of the buildings around the beach.Locals might also set some simple firework.
Interesting and beautiful at night,The longest suspension bridge in Korea. A good view from the bridge.The lighting is very nice at night.
Beautiful bridge,Passed from the bridge during Busan City tour trip.... Beautiful bridge with awesome view... Specially during evening time....
Beautiful bridge with a nightly show,"The bridge is a must see if in the area. The bridge lights up at night with a light and music show, its a lovely thing to watch, while eating and drinking in the restaurants on the beach. "
White Golden Gate,"The 'Diamond' Bridge as it's nicknamed, looks just like the golden gate in design but it is sparkling white, like a supersized model of the original. It glows in different colours at night."
Must see!,"It was very impressive and a must see when visiting Busan. It reminded me of San Francisco USA, the Golden Gate Bridge, but longer and white. I took great pictures of the bridge. "
Touring Cyclists - Wow,"Busan Gwangandaegyo Bridge stretches over 7.4km from Namcheon-dong (Suyeong-gu, Busan) to Centum City (U-dong, Haeundae-gu). It is the longest bi-level bridge over the ocean in Korea. The bridge offers breathtaking views."
Long bridge,The Gwangandaegyo bridge is one of the longest bridge in Korea. Its nicely constructed but I am not sure why its a top attraction. However I only drove through it so may be there is some attraction built in that I missed. I doubt it
Impressive bridge,"Longest bridge in Korea. It is two layers bridge. It helps to shorten the time. It is not just a bridge for vechicles to move from A to B, it also attracts people to admire this impressive bridge and the night light display. It brcomes a place of interest."
Beautiful bridge in front of gwangalli beach,"This is an excelllent landmark and attraction in Busan. I drove through it and then stayed at the Gwangan Hound hotel that has a direct view of the bridge. At night, there a repeated LED light display to catch your attention for those on the beach, the cafes and restaurants along the beach road and those staying at the buildings and hotels around the gwangalli beach. "
Go for the sunset,"Nice view, lots of people, singers (good and bad), nice view of the sunset and afterwards a lights show. There are a lot of cafes and restaurants around too."
Example of engineering art.,I had opportunity to drive through this bridge and see it from hotels window.It is breathtaking example of engineering art.
A beauty at night!,"I visited Gwangan Bridge during my recent trip to Busan. The weather was freezing cold at a temperature of -6 degrees at night. Despite the freezing cold weather, my friends and I spent time driving through the bridge with the car windows open. If you look from Marine City Haeundae, you get to see the whole bridge in all its glory. Do go there at night because the bridge will be lighted up. It is no wonder this bridge is one of Busan's famous landmark."
Symbol of Busan,"The bridge is huge and magnificent. It seems like one scene of movie. I jogged along the seashore beside this bridge like a dream. You should watch it, if you are in Busan. Many families and couples visit here for taking pictures."
Love bridges,"Well.. A bridge is a bridge. We love to see bridges from a distance and like towalk or drive on them.Nice peace of architecture.We haven't seen it when it's lid durring the night, but it looked nice dirribg the day too."
Beautiful view,"Since I only have 1 day to explore Busan, I joined Busan City Tour which operates daily and cost KRW 15,000 per person. There is a city bus located on the right side just when you exit Busan station. It was a Red Line double decker bus that start from Busan Station, stop at UN Memorial Park, Gwangalli, Marin City, Haeundae, Centum City and pass through Busan Port Grand Bridge and Gwangan Grand Bridge. The guide can speak English however since when I was, the majority of the tourists were Korean, so the guide mostly speak in Korean. Nevertheless it was fun way to explore the city when you have limited time. The view from the bridge was great."
Romantic place to stay,"Great view at night where you can see the bridge! :) It's a tourist attraction, and people flock here at night. There's also a show of fireworks nightly."
Beautiful view from the lotte mall!,We loved watching this rainbow light show front the top of the lotte store! It was beautiful ad changed colors!
Lovely night view,"Best is to sit on the staircase by the beach and enjoy a cup of hot coffee that warms your heart, quietly listen to the sound of ocean and wind that helps to clear your mind. You'll see lots of couples hanging out around that area too."
Amazing Structure,"Modern architecture , amazing structure , that is not something you thought you'll see here in Korea..."
Very Long Bridge,I had dinner on the boat called Tiffany 21 which passing the bridge several times. Gwangandaegyo bridge is the longest bridge in Busan. It is quite amazing to they made such a long bridge. The Bridge is so beautiful at night.
Spectacular Bridge,We used this bridge when went to Gyeongju on a shore excursion. This bridge is very impressive and is characteristic of the excellent infrastructure that Korea has. The bridge is about 7.4 kilometers long and apparently is the 2nd longest bridge in South Korea. We got to see the bridge in daylight and in the evening. The views of the city from the bridge are awesome.
Night view is the best...,If you wang to see its beauty you mudt visit in the evening. Lights make the bridge a jewelry.we saw the bridge from very close distance..Its hard to find a parking nearby... but if you drive through the bridge you need to pay 1000 won tll fee.
Beautiful bridge,"This is a nice bridge. I viewed it from a distance as well as travelled on it. One of Busan's icon, worth a visit. The view from the bridge was very nice too."
Good night view,"Great visit in the night, gives you the feeling of being in a big city with all the lights around. An alive area with many restaurants, cafes."
Very nice bridge in Busan,"This is really a very nice bridge, which is connectin the two main parts of Busan. Excellent view from the bridge."
Amazing view,"Very open, very relaxing. Very romantic, great spot to visit with your partner around 7 to jus watch the spectacular lights. its a must visit if you're in the area. "
It's a petty bridge. ,Go to Gwangan beach at night to see this pretty bridge. If you come at the end of October you'll see a FANTASTIC fireworks show (but it's pretty crowded)
Quite nice,"Is very beautiful, of the most impressive bridges ive seen, especially at night , with all the lights and their reflection on the sea :)I wish i couldve stopped having a coffee and enjoying the view there, in the middle of the bridge :)"
nice and romantic,"in the Busan, this is one of the necessary course that you should go. at the night, the view is so beautiful. "
Sparkling Diamond!,"I love architecture and City lights and the ""Diamond"" Bridge was a must-see for me. We had travelled across the bridge during the day, which was quite impressive but it really came alive when viewed from Gwangalli Beach at night with the laser light show. The beach was fairly quiet when we visited - and very chilly!I was also able to drive across the bridge later that night and got a great view of the City lights."
Magical at night,"During the day time the bridge is an impressive piece of engineering. However it truly comes alive at night, where it is lit up. It's basically a light show, changing and projecting images across it."
Hidden in Plain Site,"Most tourists that come to Busan go to Haeundae Beach. They go there for good reason. It's a wonderful beach with lots of character. However, I would strongly suggest visiting Gwangalli Beach just a bit to the south. The reason I like it better is because it's not overrun with foreigners and there are some wonderful places to eat and drink. Head to the SOL Taphouse for some wonderful NY style pizza and some great craft beer on tap. Of course do this after you've sampled local Korean food. After all, you are in Korea!At the Taphouse you can get an amazing view of the Gwangan Bridge, or known as the Diamond Bridge. While it's not much to look at during the day, it is worth seeing at night. Koreans love to light up their bridges and this bridge is no exception. "
Very nice bridge view along beach,This bridge lights up all different colours at night.It is in Busan across from Gwangalli beach notably.
relaxing,a lovely view on a beautiful Saturday cloudy morning! the breezing and freezing and relaxing is great!
It's nice...,The bridge was smaller than expected... was expecting golden gate bridge scale. Night time pictures are nice can take it with bridge and city light. 
Beautiful view,I took the subway to Gwangan station and took exit 5. Take a left turn and walk along the main road till u reach Gwanggali beach. You will see the bridge right in front of you. It is very beautifully and colorfully lighted. I was lucky to see the synchronised light and music the moment I reached the beach. It was not a crowded beach and many people walked their dogs on the beach too.
Beautiful view,This is a must see bridge! The various colors are breathtaking. Be sure to check this out if you are in Busan. 
Looms large in the seascape,"This is a huge bridge that dominates the landscape that is also colorfully lit at night. It is a significant architectural landmark in Busan. Yes, it's a bridge but a marvelous bridge. "
"Beautiful by night, impressive by day",We saw this bridge at night from Busan Tower and also visited at night on Gwangalli Beach. When it's lit up with colours it's beautiful. During the day we viewed from Dongbaek park and you can see just how long and impressive it is. Recommend a visit.
Nice view,"Pictorial sight, scenic view within the beach. Lots of hotels and restaurants nearby. The weather was cold, 6 deg C, so there were not so much people around. It was the best time to take a beautiful picture. "
Great views,"We didn't actually got on the bridge but we had the views of the bridge from Gwangalli beach. The beach is nice ,plenty of restaurants around but hot even in October "
Beautiful at night,Scenic view with all the lights at night. Great place to sit down and enjoy the ocean air and relax. Recommend visiting at night but daytime is nice as well.
Nice light show.,"At night, the view from Gwangilli Beach over to the bridge was pretty impressive and there are ample places laid out for people to sit and watch."
Beautiful at night,"The bridge looks beautiful at night and from Dalmaji-gil Road near Haeundae Beach one could get a very good view of the bridge. There is an observation platform at the lower end of Dalmaji-gil Road, facing the bridge and the city. To access Dalmaji-gil Road one could take a taxi, or take a walk from Haeundae Beach or Jong-dong subway station. In late March and early April, the cherry-blossom-lined road is heavily jammed after sunset, hence it is better to go to the observation platform early, or walk there."
Amazing bridge,This bridge stretches from Haeundae right across the bay in front of Gwangalli beach. Instead of being an eyesore it s a beautiful bridge. Photos from marine-ro will get the whole span in. From Gwangalli beach you can watch the evening light show where scenes appear and move across the bridge - I really like the birds flying across it. Then there are huge spotlights filling the sky with bands of green and pink and blue. Travelling over the bridge gives great views of eastern Busan from the sea and lookout for the corkscrew ramp to get on at the city end... Like being on a fairground ride! 
It's a bridge!,"I'm confused why this is rated so highly as an attraction in Busan - after all, it's just a bridge. It's a nice bridge and there are many nice bridges in South Korea. Not worth a special visit. "
Fantastic view - day or night,We stayed at the Park Hyatt near the Haeundae beach area and this bridge is stunning right across from the entrance of the hotel. Also looks great from the restaurants in the hotel. The curving road leading to the bridge looks very aesthetically appealing.
Beautiful at night,"This 7.4km bridge is best seen at night when it is lit up by over 16,000 glittering LED lights. In late October the skies above the bridge are lit up by the Busan Firework festival."
Landmark of Busan,"My lovely hometown, Busan.It's soooo beautiful and amazing city.One of the best city for travel.Summer must be the best season for feeling Busan well."
Lighted up bridge,"Personally I saw the bridge from Gwangalli Beach, do go to the beach at night to witness its mini light show"
Stunning piece of engineering,We crossed the bridge as part of bus tour and it took our breath away. Definitely worth a look and this is a good way to do it.
Nice night view and stroll by the beach,one of the must visit places in busan for a night walk / view by the beach and chill.... lots of eateries along the way from the station.. so take yr pick or fried chicken n beer for a relaxing evening. 
Beautiful at night!,"According to the guide, it's the second longest bridge in S. Korea. This double decker bridge is designed to withstand earthquakes. Each level of the bridge is dedicated to each direction of the traffic flow. The lights on the bridge changes color at night and it is beautiful!"
Great drive over and view from this bridge -,If you take the city 'Hop-on / Hop-off tour' you will cross this bridge. The view from there is spectacular!!
Its a bridge!,"The bridge makes for a different and interesting background whether your playing at Gwangan beach by day or night. It the beach a different feel than any other beach I've been to. Beause of it and the beachfront bars and restaurants, I think Gwangan is a superior beach than Haundae to play at day or night. (Plus, it is generally less crowded)"
"""Rainbow"" bridge",Beautiful bridge seen from Gwangali beach. The lights give a landmark view of Busan. I love this part of the city
Impressive,"This outstanding bridge has become the most famous landmark in Busan. Not only it perfectly serves its purpose, but it enhances the beautiful scenario overlooking the coast. Enjoy its spectacular view at night time, while dining in one of the many restaurants or bars located on the banks. Definitely a must see."
Nice View,"The bridge is an attraction,at night has led lighting which makes it nice.This bridge can be seen from many places,but nearest subway station is about 10 minutes walk."
Huge,"Huge bridge that lights up at night with different colorformations, totally worth a visit, you can enjoy one of the foodplaces at the same time"
Dancing light,"A place to stroll along during evening time, after dinner, sit along the beach and enjoy the lights show on the bridge. There are a lot of bars, restaurant and shops offering different styles of food. Walk along the main street, also the small streets to discover your favourite. We tried out barbeque pork and it's taste is perfect, and the owner is nice in helping us to barbeque it (probably she can't stand the way we do it ). "
Wow!,"Not only had we the privilege to see this amazing bridge, but we also travelled on it - both ways. Have a really good look, as we imagine this is the only one in the world."
Beautiful Bridge by day and by night,This bridge is amazing in its style and its technology all around. I had so many great views of it all throughout my trip to Busan by day and night but the best is probably from the Busan Observatory and more specifically the Cheongunjeong (Blue Clouds Pavilion).
Nice night view,"Walk around the beach to see the view of the bridge is great... just that the subway a bit far from this location so have to walk some distance with your child, recomended bring along ur carrier."
Beautiful at night,This is lovely to view at night as you also have all the building city lights to add to the atmosphere. They have a light show too.. it's nothing special but cool to watch I suppose. We sat on the beach and just enjoyed the view.
Nice during day and night,Nice place by day and night. I wouldn't swim there as it is to close to cars and traffic. Crossing the bridge is a good experience. It's quite long...
I Love This Bridge,"This bridge is my gateway to Haeundae when I'm in a hurry! If its a weekend and you don't want to get jammed up in Suyeoung, you want to take the Diamond Bridge."
Moon rising,"If people love sunrise and sunset views, I loved looking at the moon rising from the horizon. The show for that night lacked the usual sound. Sunset here us at 8PM at this time of the year."
Beautiful bridge,Day-time view is not so impressive. Get to gwananlli beach about 7pm. Night view of the bridge from gwananlli beach is breath-taking. 
Looks even better in real life,"This is the place I will tell people to go to when they visit Busan. At night, the bridge lights up in an array of everchanging colours. I was very impressed and I urge people to go to Gwangalli beach to see it for themselves. Take a walk along the beachfront or sit in one of the beachside cafes or restaurants to take in the view. You won't regret it. Like others have said, it is quite a walk from Gwangan station but do not let that deter you."
Colorful bridge by night,"This bridge is quite far from the gwangan subway station. Suggest to take a cab to Gwanggali, instead of walking, especially in the summer heat and humidity.It was lit up colorfully in the evening we were there. Beautiful. A good place to stroll or sit and watch the night visitors by the beach with the bridge casted out in the bay."
Impressive,"This is an awesome double decker bridge. I have been over it in the city tour bus, on the top of the double decker bus, a fun experience. But I especially like to sit in one of the bars on the beach and watch it light up and watch the light shows it has. "
Beautiful Bridge,"My friend and I got to see the bridge at night with the beautiful light up, it's nice and looks amazing from Gwangalli beach. It's definitely worth coming to check out this beautiful night view."
"Busan's icon, wrightfully so","It's ""just"" a bridge, rather than a true attraction, so keep that in mind. I'm an urban architecture enthusiats, so I might like this kind of things more than others, but still, I would recommand it to anyone. Try and take a cab and make sure to take the bridge. It will only cost you a few bucks. First and foremost, there are two levels on the bridge. It's much better to travel from the East (Haeundae, Centum City) towards the West (central Busan), as you'll be on the top level and have an unobstructed view. Over, the view is amzing. The topology is great. The sea, the beaches, the green mountains... And then, you can go post huge glass skyscrapers (Marine City, Centum City, Yongho-dong). Tough to tell when it's better to visit. Sunny day is great, but at night or at sunset is another great time to take the bridge"
Beautiful,"We visit Gwangalli Beach on 29 April 2016. There are not much activity happening there but the view was breathtaking still. Great place for picnic, picture and there are lots of café for you to enjoy the view while sipping on some hot Americano :)p/s: if you were hoping for sunset view, this is not the place. But the beach is still beautiful on its own..."
Spectacular no matter the weather,Gwangandaegyo Bridge – it’s not often that one can get a really good view of a modern engineering marvel but here in Busan one can look at the main spans of the bridge while strolling on a beautiful clean sandy beach or even sitting in one of the many of the beach front cafés and restaurants.Not only that but for the nerds (like me) out there the City Fathers have even had the forethought to provide a full scale example of one of the hangers which supports the decks. Oh and one more thank you to the City Fathers - should you get to this part of Busan by using the excellent local Metro then set into what we Brits call pavements (and Americans term sidewalks) there is a series of signs showing how far one has to go.And for those who want a close up Lions International have even installed FREE to use binoculars.As we also drove across it (on another day) in a Typhoon it seems to be quite sturdy!
View from Busan Train Station,We just saw the bridge from Busan Train Station. It was included in our itinerary but due to time contraint we were not able to visit it. But it has a nice view from the train station especially at night.
Beautiful Bride at Busan,We take photo of the beach from gwangli Beach and all the photos look awesome. sit at the cafe enjoy the coffee really a worderful day at Busan 
cool,very nice bridge - cool to go over….its part of the red route on the hop on hop off route…nice architecture…great view of the city
A Feat and Beautiful Landmark,"The Gwangan Bridge is a wonderous structure. You can wikipedia all the information you need, but it's hard to express its importance to the skyline. Hangout with a drink on Gwangali Beach at night while couples lights sparklers and shoot fireworks into the sky. Stare at the bridge as it lights up and relax."
Fantastic achievement ,As far as bridges go this is a beautiful structure and a fantastic achievement in engineering and design. I believe it's the longest suspension bridge in Korea. Worth a drive over for the experience and views.
Go by night,I loved seeing this bridge during the night. It really is a diamond bridge! It blings blings and mesmerizes your eyes.
The bridge is a sign of new Busan...,"No question, its huge and its good looking. Its a political message - here is Korea, new and big, and able to achieve lots of high goals for the nation if it operates twrds a coomon goal."
"A wonderful bridge to go thru, or just to watch.","The view from the bridge while going in, or the bridge itself when viewed from various spots in Busan, is breathtaking. "
Gwangan Bridge area,"Beautiful scenery, sea tours, boat rides, good seafood and pastry places, friendly people. Fireworks festival held annually off this bridge around september october period."
Mammoth Structure,You will see this bridge from all over Busan. Can be seen from Haeundae Beach. You might drive over it from the airport. You will see lots of new buildings from the bridge. Affluent area.
Quick view of the Bridge,I saw this bridge several time. In 2012 we stayed next to this Bridge. Night view is beautiful with lights. Day pretty view with blue water. This time had just few minutes get there and have photo and gone. I'll go back there again.
Otherworldly ambience ,Very beautiful at night. This bridge is illuminated with purple light that gives an otherworldly ambience. However You cannot stop at any point on the bridge.
Take the Night Bus City Tour,"I would recommend that you take the Night Bus City Tour to see this. It costs 15k won and the trip starts & ends at the Busan Station. The tour is 2.5 hours, and provides a good view of the bridge from various places in Busan. They even take you on a ride across the bridge. It comes with 3 photo stops at strategic places.Reservations preferred as seats are limited.In the day, the bridge looks quite normal. However, at night, this bridge is well lit up and offers a pretty sight."
Bride is lit at night,Great pictures of the bridge at night as the lights change color. A must see in Busan. Our family enjoyed it!
Stunning in the evening,We seen this bridge from the beach during the day time and evening. The night view is lovely. Great for photography. 
Icon of Busan,"Climbed up the hwangrong mountain and had a brilliant view of the gwangan bridge at night, did the igidae park trail and saw the gwangan bridge on the other side. Beautiful."
Nice view,"Very nice and stunning view, we were taking hop on Bus tour (Busan Tour) and passing by the bridge.. "
Beautiful view,Sit somewhere quiet to enjoy a cup of coffee and the stunning day or night view. Cover this area with a evening trip near Haeundae beach area
It is worth the toll payment to take in the view from the bridge,I suggest taking a taxi from downtown to the beach via the bridge when you first arrive in Busan. The view from the bridge is beautiful. There is a toll on the way though so it does cost you extra. 
A Long Bridge and Nice Beacg,We walked along the boardwalk on the beach and took many pictures of the bridge and the buildings. Lots of places to eat along the way. Stopped for a burger and beer before heading back to our friends house.
"A very pretty bridge, especially at night.","It was very enjoyable to see the bridge lit up at night. Sometimes bridges add little but clutter to a city's landscape. But, this one enhances Busan's waterfront, I think, something like their own Golden Gate. I really didn't think our taxi ride from Haeundae to Busan Station would take us across the bridge, but it did. It's an unusual concept to see a bridge and causeway that takes the traffic congestion from the city a puts it out into the harbor, and looks good doing it."
"Elegant, Illuminating and Captivating Bridge!","Absolutely a must see when in Busan. Every year we come here we make it a point to go to beach and watch one of the most beautiful light displays you'll ever see on any bridge. With animation and colorful glitter, you will be entertained and in awe. Hope you enjoy it as much as we did! "
Great for photos,"I was walking through a park and just came across this bridge whilst killing some time in Busan. It is a lovely site to see and you can get some lovely photos. I didn't actually go on the bridge, I just stood and watched it from the park (APEC Naru Park). I would recommend going to the park if you want to get a view of the entire bridge and nice scenery. "
A trip in the harbor,I went under the bridge in the afternoon and returned after sundown. The night lights are quite impressive on the bridge
"Beautiful Bridge Great Enginering work, ART Monument","More than an Engineering Atraction, it is an ART Monument, inspired in the strong Spirit of Korean People."
Beautiful seen from Igidae Coastal Trail,"We saw the bridge by night from Haeundae Beach and by day from Igidae coastal walk, its magnificant and beautifully built. It envelopes Busan on its eastern coast, truly spectacular. "
Gwangandaegyo Bridge,Better go there at night. It will lit up at night. it is really beautiful like diamond shining!!! there got a lot of hotels along beach.
A bridge ,Nice beach with a bridge ... I went twice.. at night was cold and dark I liked it in the daytime. I guess you can reach it by subway. There are many places to eat and kakaroake bang there 
Check It Out At Night ,"From the beach you will get a beautiful view of the bridge all lit up at night, lots of young people with small fireworks shooting them off above the water makes the sight all the more enjoyable."
One of Busan landmark ,This bridge allows for a stunning view of the city. Rare traffic jams and overall a great addition to the city.
Relaxing,"Bridge with dancing lights, beach, not so many people, cool wind, food, good company. This was probably the best activity my mom and I did when we were in Busan. It is quite far from Songdo if you are staying there (we were)...around 45 mins by bus. But it was worth the trouble to just sit on the sand and watch the mesmerizing play of lights on the bridge. I'd go back here if I return to Busan, just so I can unwind and sit silently for a few hours."
It Is just a bridge,"I am not sure how a bridge can be one of the highlights/things to do for a city. It really is nothing special. If you are in the area, fine take a look and if you take a taxi maybe you can get the chance to actually use it. But it is just a bridge."
Both night and day,I went ofer this bridage on several occasion during the day and at night. Quite impressive i also saw it from a distance alllight up a maust see when visiting Busan
visit at dusk or dawn,At night the bridge is lit and makes for a lovely picture taken from Haeundae Beach. This landmark is popular for car commercials. 
Diamond Bridge,If you have been in San Francisco you must go to visit Golden Gate Bridge and Busan as well you don't forget to see Diamond Bridge
"very nice, especially at night",had several good photos take hear. very very nice.. cool breeze at night. during the day. the bridge is viewable at the Apec house. with blue sky. 
"Soft sand, nice place to chill","There were mini fireworks show when I was there, perfectly compliment the backdrop of the well-lit bridge. A treat for the eyes!"
Ilumited Bridge at Night,We took a cab to Gwangan Beach as I read review that subway station is quite a distance. The view of the bridge with colourful lighting is nice and the sea breeze is calm and not very strong. 
Frieworks show,"They do a fireworks show end of Oct each year, amazing, check it out, get there early. Nice place to visit at night as the bridge lights up. "
Gorgeous at night ,I came here at night with a friend of mine-it was all lit up which looked really nice and could be seen from the beach on the street front where all the bars are. If you hit the right bar you can sit and see the bridge and watch the lights change colour.
Suspension bridge,The bridge connects two important islands of bus an and brings smoother connectivity for the residents. It is a suspended bridge within largest span of 500 Mets and it is over 7km in length.the construction started in 1996 and completed partially in 2002 for Asian games. It is now open for all
Lighted bridge changes colour at night,"The best two things that I liked about the bridge was that it changed colour at night, and we were able to play with fireworks. There was a lady selling fireworks, which was in effect a miniature version of the ones launched in my country on its National Day. So this was a big thrill for us since these are banned where we came from. The area was also lighted up by brightly lit buildings around the beach which gave the night a nice touch of colour."
Stunning at Night,"This bridge is beautiful at night. With the background of pitch dark sky, it truly live it up the the name - Diamond Bridge.From our guesthouse in Baesan, my friend & I took bus no #62. Alight at Gwangalli Haesuyogjang bus stop (bus stop no: 14-068).Just a few meter walk from the bus stop, we can see the stunning bridge from far.Near the beach, there's a lot of hanging out place & convenience store.However, the environment at Gwanggali Beach quite messy. Rubbish here and there. If I'm not mistaken, a day before our arrival they have firework festival."
A Masterpiece,"We stayed at the lovely Paradise Hotel & Casino. We could see this bridge from our luxurious room...made better at night, with the lights. SO beautiful and with no real competition around it immediately.We also rode over it on the Seoul City Tour Bus. It is High!Try to see it illuminated."
Beautiful night scene,"The bridge was lighted up at night. Against a very dark backdrop with no lighted buildings at the back, the bridge was stunning. The beach was wide , with families and couple taking a leisure stroll after dinner. Many eateries lined along the beach so do go for dinner. Gwangan station is about 20 mins subway ride from Seomyeon station, followed by a 15 mins walk to the beach. Not tough, very easy find. Exit 3 , at Gwangan station , turn right and follow the crowd or path towards beach. There are metal signs on the ground that tells you how far you're from beach, as you walked. "
Nice drive course!,"It does not give so impressive scenery during daytime. However if you drive a car from Haeundae centum area to Namcheon dong way, you can enjoy great view of sea and sky, bridge and buildings, beach and mountains! Go through 4th lane after center of bridge, and then turn to the right just after coming down from bridge. Pass some apartment buildings. And then you will find out you are already in the Gwanan-ri beach which has awesome night scenery of Diamond bridge. There are plenty of nice pubs and cafe and restaurants. Just have fun there~!"
Go in the evening for fantastic views ,Great place for a break for your tired legs between sightseeing hotspots. Grab a drink with you and sit and relax with the gorgeous views 
Gwangan Grand Bridge,"This is a beautiful bridge since it is built in the sea in front of the Gwangan Beach. In particular, this is more beautiful when led lights on it are lit at night. Busan Firework Festival is held here on Saturday around 24th every October."
Must visit at night!,"You can enjoy the view of this beautiful bridge from Gwangalli Beach at night! Really, don't miss it!"
The San Francisco Bridge of S.K.,"This bridge is absolutely beautiful, especially at night. It also beautiful to see it from Gwangan beach at sunset or sunrise. Also during the firework festival in October where they have the most spectacular firework display the world has ever seen. There are many great bars and restaurants you can go to on Gwangan beach where you can sit with a nice view of the bridge. Beached bar, Thursday Party and Sharky's are good bars. It's also worth it to drive over the bridge in order to see the view of the city of Busan. "
Stunningly beautiful!,The bridge itself is an architectural masterpiece. By day you can lie on the beach and soak in it's awesomeness and by night you can watch its colorful lighting spectacle unfold. Truly a must see in Busan.
fireworks,Went to the fireworks festival 2014 Awesome place. The place was very clean and a lot to see and do. 
Great Views,"Came to check out Gwangali Beach and Gwangan Bridge on a Saturday night. This is a very fun area in Busan to check out the view and enjoy the nightlife. There are a ton of restaurants and bars in the area, along with people enjoying drinks and blowing off fireworks on the beach. Definitely stop by here if you are in the area."
beautiful,beautiful bridge ; must go to view this diamond bridge during nigh time ; surrounding quite a number of coffee shop and restaurant 
Impressive ,The bridge is very beautiful in night time. Walking road in front of bridge is perfect place to release daily stress and enjoy night view of the bridge. Perfectly good place to visit with family and kids (waking through the road located toward the water).
Good view ,This bridge is very big its enormously long and interesting to look at. You get a good view of the city and the water way it's a nice walk and it's a great way to spend an afternoon. 
City Bus Tour,"just a magnificent bridge,take the city bus tour,open top bus,just a great experience,unfortunately we were to late to catch the bus back which would have given you views of the bridge from the beach"
view is ok and many people to go,easy to find and many shop near the Bridge.View is ok the Bridge is far from the beachhard to take pic and you can just see
Beautiful view at night,The Gwangan Bridge is why I prefer Gwangalli over Haeundae. There are restaurants all along the beach that make it particularly nice to sit on a patio at night and look at the lit-up bridge. 
A nice view of the bridge,"It has a nice vie in the night, the light makes the bridge more beatiful! But it's quite far to walk from the metro"
Fireworks!!!,"This bridge is beautiful anytime of the day. Even more so when its lights are on at night. It has been featured in many Korean Dramas or movies.Our favorite time to visit the Gwangan area is during the Busan Fireworks Festival. It will be jam packed with people all staring at this bridge waiting for the firework show to begin. Aside from appreciating the view, you may also try to explore the area and find some really good Western theme bars around. Party Hard!"
Light up your life,"The bridge it a must see! I viewed the bridge from the beach as well as from Igidae park. I think the further view is better, and a bit more serene. "
nice view,nice night view and near by the beach there have many cafe and bar. is a very relax place if u enjoy the view with a cup of coffee.
Busan's longest and most special bridge,Best seen from Gwangan beach or from the lobby lounge of the Park Hyatt Busan. Nighttime when they light it up is definitely a postcard moment!
Nice view,"Beautiful view from the beach. Nice place to visit during the night where is possible to find many restaurants, coffee shops."
Pretty bridge at night,Really beautiful at night. I viewed it from the walkway near Haeundae Beach. My kids sailed under the bridge and said that it was really cool.
Great view,when you come to Busan you got to go here to see the wonderful view of the water and the city.It is a beautiful bridge.
Beautiful at night,It's an astounding bridge especially at night when it's is all lit up. Not to mention there is a lot to do in the area. Worth a visit.
Diamond bridge,"Busan's landmark bridge. This bridge's english name is 'diamond bridge'(I don't know why). In Gwangalli beach, You can see the really nice bridge view. Especilly night."
very nice on night!,"Great view, when you taking dinner or having a beer on the beach facing the bridge, and very good place relax and enjoy the local atmosphere!"
Spectacular bridge by day and night.,The bridge is about five kilometers long and is visible from all over town. The graceful central arch towers over the harbor and is lit up at night.
Best at night,This bridge is famous for its lights and music therefore it is much better to watch it at night and from certain distance.I watched it first on the late evening walk and then from the ferry deck on the way to Fukuoka.Definitely recommend second option ;)
Amazing night views in Busan,You should head for the sea front of marine City (Park Hyatt is located there) to walk along the seaside and capture the amazing night views of the bridge . Certainly of the best spots in Busan
Great sight at night,Great site to be seen at night . Not very far from the city center . Taxi transport easily available.
The Diamond Bridge,"Unlike a bridge that takes you across the water to a main land or an island this bridge just goes out to the water in front of Gwangalli beach about a mile out then goes back inland. It's more like a short cut from Namcheon-dong (Suyeong-gu, Busan) to Centum City (U-dong, Haeundae-gu) by way of the ocean. You can go to and fro from both cities w/out this bridge. It's kinda weird seeing a bridge in front of you while swimming on the beach. At night the bridge lit up w/a light show and one of the best fireworks show of Asia is held on this bridge. It's best to go over this bridge on a city tour bus with no roof. "
Beautiful bridge,"Best view to see this bridge is from deck of traditional ship on the sea at afternoon. You can sea bridge, APEC building, beach and attractive light from the ship. I promise, you can't forgot this experience."
A Long Bridge,You can see the bridge from the beach nearby; the beach direction is to the east hence you can not get a sunset photo with the bridge. Can go from Gwangan station and walked for a while. 
The light show was disappointing,"Well, we were expecting a spectacular light show and went to the View Buffet (Igidae Seokgari, Namgo Yongho dong,5-4 (above the Igidae Coastal Trail), Busan, South Korea) for dinner to watch the show. It was nothing to go out of your way for--just repeating light flickers."
Really you have to be there.,I am Korean so i have been there before but my customer from Germany they love that place. Nice view and a lot of sea food. Just feel free of your self there.
BEAUTIFUL GWANGA BRIDGE,"One of the most interesting sites in Busan, especially at night! Viewing the bridge from one of the high rises is a perfect spot for great pictures "
Night View - Colorful,The colorful lights on the bridge makes it look very attractive at night.. pretty photogenic.. take a walk at the beach and enjoy
"Come for the light show, stay for the nightlife","While impressive on it's own, the main attraction here is the light show put on nightly from nearby Gwangalli Beach. During the show, the bridge is lit up with multi colored lights in time with music. It's entertaining, particularly with sand under your feet and a drink in your hand on Gwangalli Beach."
Great Night View,This Gwangan Bridge is so beautiful at night.If you are into Jjimjilbang(Korean sauna). there is one big jjimjilbang front of Gwangan Bridge. you can enjoy the bridge and relaxed at the same time. :)
Amazing view Point,"I went to gwangali several times and every time seems i came here for first time. i enjoyed several events there like Fire work and Gwangalli Eobang Festival. Many Coffee shops and restaurants at Gwangali beach, enjoy view and coffee wow i love it and hope that every body do. some time students come in group and do play there."
Beautiful,The architecture on this bridge is phenomenal. It's well worth a photo. Even better is to view it from Gwangali beach where you can relax too
What a view at night,Make sure you see Gwangan Bridge at a distance at night. The view with all the lights is quite impressive!!
Spectacular View at Nite,"if you're a beach person, you should visit Gwanggali beach... maybe sunset is nice..but evening is even more beautiful with the lights on...."
Connecting people,"I always like bridges... why? bridges connect people. here the design is a good part of it, and the views from there are quite good."
trippy at night,Beautiful scenic bridge. The show begins at night though. The lights will keep you smiling through the night.
Take the night tour,This is a suspension bridge stretching across the bay opposite Gwangalli Beach. Take the night tour and see the changing lights. It is quite show. You'll feel like you're in a watery Las Vegas.
Bridge of Lights!,"Saw the Gwangan Bridge at night time which was beautiful as it was all lit up! I recommend sitting on Gwangan beach around evening, eating an ice-cream and watching the bridge light up! "
Fantastic view at night,"The bridge is a suspension bridge connecting Haeundae-gu and Suyeong-gu. It is 7420m long and 24m wide. It is the longest bridge in South Korea and a bridge on the sea, built to ease the traffic jams of Busan and a major tourist attraction of the area. It is a 2 story structure with 8 cross lanes. It is equipped to show over 100,000 various lighting effects. When the multi colored illumination of the bridge takes place at around 7 pm, it is just magnificent. To get here , take subway line 2, stop at Gwangan station, exit 5 and walk for 5 minutes."
Most impressive,"This is South Korea's longest suspension bridge. It is 4.6 miles in length and offers wide views of the surrounding islands and countryside, provided it is not too smoggy."
Colorful bridge,"It's at Haeundae Beach. you can see it once you reach the beach. At night, you can see many color on the bridge."
One of the Civil Engineering Marvel..,"I have a privilege to drive on this bridge daily :). I love driving on this bridge. Especially driving in early mornings and at evenings when the LEDs glitter all over the bridge.. It's a nice scenic view from Gwangan and Haeundae area. If you got see it's beauty at peak, visit during the Fireworks festival which is held every year in Nov. Will be very crowded but still worth watching it!"
lightup Bridge,Just skip this as it nothing but some colorfully lights decorating the bridge. There is nothing surrounding this area except food and buildings. 
Beautiful lighted bridge,The beach is about 10 minutes walk from Gwangan metro station. Love the brightly lighted bridge and the surrounding buildings. 
Is just a bridge decorate with light,"For me, is really so-so, but if you buy the 1 day pass and got nowhere to go in night, here is not a bad choice to go,if you could make it after 9pm is better, coz the light show just began."
lights up and has music -and you thought it was just for traffic,Probably one of the most entertaining bridges you will hear of. There is a light and music show in the evening.
Nice at night,"Not anything amazing, but at night it is lit up and has a light performance every so often. We walked down the beach and enjoyed the light performance."
very harmonized.,"The sun set was splendid. very harmonized with sea, city. Its curve was very beautiful. I need to watch the flame festival near here."
Busan!,Not to be missed for this Gwangan Bridge if you travel to Busan. It is one of the signature Bridge. I prefer the night view if compare to the day time view. Stunning bridge view at night!
Good View,"Good view of the bridge at its glory and where we can see the happening of the city, young people everywhere and restaurants all round"
Beautiful,Also known as Diamond Bridge. It's beautiful especially at night!! Can see it from the beach and from Dongbaek Island.
Beautiful,Also known as Diamond Bridge. It is beautiful especially at night!!! Can see it from the beach and from Dongbaek Island.
nice lights on bridge,"Not a must see but an easy walk from the metro and the beach itself seems nice. Of course, in winter it is deserted. Summer I heard is a different story. Lights on bridge are nice to see and many restaurants in the area (prices might be a bit higher compared to other Busan areas though)."
Best viewed from Gwangalli Beach,"This bridge is lovely and elaborately lit up at night. If you wanna see it at it's best, go to Gwangali beach. Enjoy!"
Night View,"The highlight is the night view. Dont Miss it while you are in Busan. Its really beautiful. Besides that, if you drive on the bridge you will see a view of Busan with the beaches and buildings."
Great night view,"Gwangan beach provides an amazing night view not only of Gwangan Bridge, which is known for its lights, but also of the border of the sea with very colorful and lighted buildings. It is much closer to downtown than the city's most famous beach. Totally worth it."
Fantastic view,"I didn't actually go onto the bridge, because my Korean friends say that the view is best viewed from Gwangalli Beach, which is what I did!"
Beautiful Light,Korea has a very good bridge. It really a landmark that lit beautifully on the night and deserves the name (Diamond Bridge)
Beautiful architecture,"The bridge looks very beautiful, day or night, but really sparkles when lit up! Great place to visit. "
Saw it at night ,I went on the busan city tour bus at night (7pm) and this was a stop we got off at and took pictures. Really cool to walk along the beach with all the lights (would be amazing in summer I'd imagine). Beautiful to see it all lit up.
Pretty light-up,"After reading the reviews, we pretty much knew what it was gonna be like. Basically, a lighted bridge, it provides a nice backdrop for photo taking. Its also quite a distance from the nearest train station, taking about 20 minutes walk to reach. "
Nice bridge with neon lights,"Best if there is music accompany. Nice bridge with neon lights display. A distance from train station, so prepare the walk. Is also a location welcomed by locals, and couples,"
Nice view ,I was told that when you come to Busan if you did not visit Gwangalli Beach for the view of the Gwangan Bridge you have not been to Busan. So I included this place in my itinerary. We took the subway to Gwangan Station Exit 5 and it took about 10-15mins walk to reach the Gwangalli Beach. Opposite the beach is the Gwangan Bridge. Christmas music was played and from far the Gwangan Bridge lights will follow the flow of the music. It was so beautiful.There are lots of cafe along the beach. You can also have the skyline view across the beach. A nice experience with cold wind blowing.Nice view and we enjoyed it. 
appropriate area for relaxing,"The night view from the beach was definitely brilliant!! The beach and surroundings are mostly clearer and more afford to spend free time than Haewoondae. If you don't like noisy and crowdy, just visit here and take relax with beautiful ocean. Also, many restaurants and cafes are along the beach road so you can have a light walk then rest at any restaurants. All they show off with great views."
Very beautiful bridge,"The construction and beautiful lightning in the night makes this space very attractive, especially during the firework festival. "
beautiful at night,"Looking at the bridge from Gwangalli Beach, with the glittering buildings behind me. It is a long bridge, but it only gets extraordinary at night, when it is flooded in lights. Two of the pillars are beautifully illuminated - in changing colors. "
Shines bright like a diamond,"Such a splendor sight to behold when it's lit at night, the reason for it's nick name, Diamond bridge. Viewing it from afar from Dalmaji Hill is as awesome as staring at it just a few meters away from Gwangalli Beach."
Beautiful!,It's breathtakingly beautiful!! Should go at night to see the lighted up bridge. Its abit cold at night but it's all worth it!
Jaw dropping,Must see for the Busan Foreworks Festival in October each year. A one hour firework show followed by a laser show. Incredible!
The Diamond Bridge,"This 7.42km long bridge that connects Suyeong-gu with Haeundae-gu makes a fantastic walk on a good day. Also at night time its filled with beautiful lights, making it a great spot for couples as well. It's really a bridge that I have grown attached to and writing it makes me want to visit again soon!"
very beautiful bridge,i like the construction a lot. the bridge looks very nice on the landscape ove the sea and with the City scrappers and hills behind. It looks very beautiful during the night with its lightening and music show. Very impresive and worth to see it.
Magical,"One of my fav place in Busan. I was kinda lucky the first time I was there in Winter so the beach was empty and quiet. There were some people shooting the fireworks up. I was just sitting there enjoying the cold breeze. The purple light of the beach gave out lonely feeling yet captivating. I went there again in Sep. The beach was crowed. Even worse there are people transforming the beach for some event. I assume it was for BIFF which is held in Oct. Haeundae was transforming to BIFF stage too. I actually vow to myself to never visit Busan in Sep - Oct again. BIFF is good for movie love but simply a disaster for someone who wants an empty beaches like me. Also at 8 pm there is lighting/musical show of the bridge. Worth watching! If you come from the GwangAn subway, just catch a bus to the beach (GwangAn Oksu Jang). Walking is too tiring for me."
An unreal structure,We crossed this bridge on our tour bus. It is one of the best I have crossed but very hard to get a photo of when on a bus. Try to see it if in Busan.
Enjoy Gwangan Bridge at Sunset,Enjoy the view of the bridge during the sunset on Gwangalli beach and then see the bridge light up at night with its display of vibrant colors. A well built bridge with lots of character. Don't miss it!
Most beautiful at dawn & after dark,"I stayed at Park Hyatt which had a great view out over the Gwangan Bridge, so I saw the sun rise over it (so serene) and also at night when they had the LED light show going on (so enchanting). Fell in love with the bridge and drove across it too - such a nice thing to do. One might say I'm obsessed with bridges and it might be true but I would go back to Busan just to gaze at this particular bridge again :)"
Awesome,It looks and have the same design as Golden Gate in the US. Walk along the walkway from the cove and enjoy the scenery especially during evening time
A PLEASENT SIGHT!!!,This defines the modern Busan.... It is a beautiful peice of Korean engineering...It is a pleasent sight and u just cannot miss it when in Busan.ENJOY THE SIGHT!!!
Beautiful bridge,"Best viewed from Gwangali beach. We tried to cross it on the local buses, but couldn't find the right bus number. Nothing more to say."
Best view at night,The Sydney harbour bridgeequivalent of Busan. Best viewed at night due to its colorful lights and romantic atmosphere around the beach. They sell fire crackers around the beach small ones though or anything that resembles or generates a firework show. 
Nice view to the landscape.,"Dont know about the bridge itself, haven't step on it, but the night view, looking to the lights and bridge is worth staying, very cool. Get some drinks, food, spread a rubber mat or something and pick a spot at the beach."
Just a Pretty Bridge If You Miss The Light Show,"We were able to view Gwangan Bridge from both sides of the bay, both from DongBaek Island and from the Gwangali Beach. Unfortunately, even though we were watching the bridge nearly all night we did not see the fantastic lights we were hoping for. Mind you, the bridge is still very pleasing to the eye even without a light show, however, it loses a lot of its uniqueness and becomes just another pretty bridge. If you are hoping to see it, make sure you confirm the times for the light show, otherwise, it is only worth seeing if you happen to be in the area already."
An inspiring bridge,It is best viewed at night to see the lights along the bridge. Good place to take picture and may be the subject for your painting.
Traffic bridge with light show,"Impressive bridge - two layers - enormous span across the bay - great to watch the world pass by on it from Gwangalli beach. Every night it has a spectacular light show - only 10 minutes worth but incorporating lasers from the shore and a pattern of neon lights built into the bridge .... all this to music. This every day at 8 and 10pm - Friday 8, 9 & 10pm and Saturday at 10pm only. Well that's what their website says but suggest you check locally as those times didn't quite coincide with what we saw during our visit albeit that was during the festival"
Beautiful,"This was a gorgeous bridge. We went on a walking tour throughout the city and were very happy to come across this. I don't really think there is much use in crossing the bridge, but it was nice to look at it from the wall. There are lots of children walking about with their parents, but it is not something that I would stay at for very long if you do have children with you. It made for some wonderful photos, even though we did not stay for the evening light show."
Lovely light + music show,I visited Gwangalli Beach mainly to see the famous Gwangan Bridge. Didn't know there is a light show and we were lucky to view the light+music show. It lasted about 10 minutes. Very enjoyable.
Pretty diamond bridge,the bridge is really pretty and has a LED music show at night. do check out the performance time and make yourself there. 
Cool,"I think Gwangan Bridge / beach was a better site than Haeundae beach during the time of our visit. It was raining when we went to Haeundae beach :) View was nice, and the place is clean. There were some good spots to sit along the shore"
Beautiful scene,"This bridge is awesome in day and night. you can not miss this attraction, easily to have a look from Gwangalli beach."
Diamond bridge,This was the last place I've visited before leaving Busan. I went there at night to see the light up of the famous Gwangan bridge. There are people sitting at the beach to relax while enjoying the breeze. This place is surrounded by restaurants and it feel safe at night. I think it is still worth a trip there even just for couple of minutes to snap a few shots of night scene. Gwangan Bridge represent Busan.
Magnificent when lit up!,"The bridge is at its best in the evening, when it is lit up - Ideally viewed from Gwangali Beach or from Dongbaek Island. It is a two tier bridge with road traffic on both tiers. Essentially it is a Suspension bridge set into the sea. Driving across is in itself an experience, as you get a fantastic view of the elegant new skyscrapers of Busan. The International Fireworks festival makes the bridge even more famous - the fireworks almost celebrating the beauty of the bridge!"
Probably the most famous thing in Busan,"This bridge is in all of the advertisements for busan, and for any festival in busan, even if it does not take place near there. You can walk across the bridge with no cars during certain times of the year."
