Nice place for Korean people and their Children,"Seoul national university is the best one in South Korea,I went to there on the Mid-Autumn day that is the most important holiday of Korean people.Many presents took their children to there,to make them up in studying.The university is big and a little far from downtown.You need to take a bus to there under subway.And I visited the College of Arts,because I am majoring in English Literature and Culture.But I think maybe students who like science would like there.Too much scientific surrounding to scientists.The library is big and excellent,you can study there with a quiet.Good luck to applicators."
