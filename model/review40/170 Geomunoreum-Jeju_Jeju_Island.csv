A graceful place with great forest,"오름은 오르기 쉬웠고 가이드분 설명도 훌륭했습니다. 지질학적으로나 식물학적으로나 가치가 큰 곳이라 한번쯤 방문하시는 걸 추천합니다. 하지만 예약이 필수고 매주 화요일은 휴무이니 유의하셔야 합니다. The oreum was not that difficult to hike, and the guide provided quite a nice explanation. Geologically and Botanically meaningful place to visit. But reservation is mandatory, and every Tuesday is off. "
must try the originality of Jeju island's nature!,"UNESCO World Natural Heritage. Geomun Oreum represents more than 300 oreums in Jeju Island. By experiencing the primitive form and history of oreum, u can learn the awe of nature. Anyone who wants to know the essence of Jeju Island must challenge. Even if u do not understand Korean, u will be impressed by what you see. Reservation required."
Natural scene lover,If u do not object natural scenicThis place is the most value for money u must visit. Entrance fee is only 2000w for adults . easy walking path for child.the only deficit is the tour guide can only speak in korean. The most amazing wonder is the entrance fee includes a 25 minutes well filemed 4D movie
Do it Yourself.,"We drove ourselves and although a little hard to find, it was worth the effort. The area was quite well set out with information and small local restaurant and gift shop area. Entry is free to Jeju workers but about 5,000 won - the steps down are step but well made. We walked about 2 kms to the end of the tunnel - it was damp, cold and generally well lit. Wear sturdy shoes and a warm coat, take a water bottle. Worth a look."
4D film tells a good story ,It was unfortunate that the immersion tour group was delayed in setting out on a one hour journey to this natural heritage centre that we were not allowed to visit the 5 lava tubes. However the 4D film of a little boy 's adventure on this island more than made up for the disappointment of not visiting the lava tubes. It would have been a great trekking experience to the lava tubes from the museum exhibits & brochures ... perhaps it warrants another visit to this island?
Guide-interrupted walk,"I went with three friends to Geomunoreum on a Sunday in February 2016. The first thing I'd recommend is ensuring that your taxi driver takes you to the right place as ours dropped us off an hour's walk away from where we were supposed to be at an abandoned building.When we finally got to the Oreum we got in for free as Jeju English teachers. I think the prices were around 5KWon per person without Jeju residency.We had to join a tour group (obviously Korean-speaking guide) for the whole walk. The stops were far too regular and spoke for too long. This is why the route options are 1 hour/2.5hours/3.5hours (I think), because the guiding makes them so long! I guess it was our fault for not being able to understand, but it did mean the walk was interrupted and the experience ruined a little by travelling in a pack. We tried to pace ourselves between groups but kept getting trapped in them. I don't think you can do this walk without a guide.That said, the views were beautiful."
Not worth a visit,"We went with high expectation, thinking that we could go into the larva tube. To our utmost disappointment, besides a 4-D movie, It was just a museum with some picture exhibits, and glassed up exhibits of a very small part of the larva tube. Admission was W3,000. It took us a long time to get there, as the bus was a 50 minute wait and it was extremely cold that day."
A relaxing stroll surrounding the crater,"This is not a common attraction but it's a place where we can follow the path and walk around the crater. Though pitifully there is no more water in the crater, it's still an interesting place to visit. The walk just take around 30 minutes. Apart from the crater, it's also a good place to overlook the plains and farmlands.The only offset of this site is its accessibility and limited car park. There is no public transport to go to this place. We drove by ourselves. After we drove off the main road, we entered a small road to the peak. The path is so narrow that only one car can go through, but it is for two-way traffic."
Go down and walk inside the crater of a UNESCO site,"Please visit this place only if you really love and in great passion to help preserve the nature. This attraction requires reservation as it only allow 400 hikers daily. There are 10 sessions and 3 different trails, a one-hr one, a 2.5-hr and a 3.5-hr one. All hikers will be lead by a center guide. Though the guide speaks only Korean and knows only limited English, there are signage and descriptions on each special location.We joined the first session and started at 9. We were required to arrive at least 10 minutes before 9, then bought the ticket (2000 won each) and showed the tickets to the Information Desk. Then we were given a badge which we needed to put on all the time and returned to the Desk after the hike. No food, including candies and gums, are allowed. Only water, without colours or tastes, is allowed to bring into the site. There is a water machine inside the Information Desk.The ""Gotjawal"" forests, grow in the center of the Geomunoreum crater, are very dense and luxuriant. While you can only look from the outlook points at Sangumburi 山君不離 and Seongsan Ilchulbong Tuff Cone 城山日出峰, this activity is an authentic encounter inside the crater, with the geological formation, vegetation and traits of lava activities"
