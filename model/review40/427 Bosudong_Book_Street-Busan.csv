Books Galore,This alley is filled with books.... old books....The shops are literally filled with books...Fiction.. non-fiction.. children.. autobiographies.. and much more. I was lucky to have found two books.. The Little Prince and Aesop Fables that has both English and Korean in it.A few dramas also filmed some of their scenes here. Getting to the street is a bit complicated. You can choose to take the taxi. Else below was how i got to the place.Directions:.. Toseong Station.. Exit 1.. Walk straight.. Busan Bank will appear on your right at a junction. Turn right there... Walk past the bank and a church towards a traffic junction.. Cross the junction and turn right.. Walk straight till you see a traffic junction where pedestrians can also cross diagonally... Cross straight and go left.. Bosu Book Street is on the right on the immediate street
Books are in Korean so...,Ok we were in the area and passed by. The alley is very small and it does smell of old books! There’s a good looking cafe near the end so maybe you can find a good read and settle down.It is a small alley so won’t take u very long to walk through if that’s all you’re doing. There’s a couple of statues and info at the ends saying why it’s famous.
The alley smelt of old books. Romantic!,"The alley smelt of old books. Even if you don't buy any books here, you can still enjoy the mood. In the middle of the alley, there is a book cafe named 우리글방(Uri-geulbang). It's a good place to take a rest. They sell small desserts, coffee, beverages, and also old books. And the shop is full of second-hand books, posters and LPs. Great atmosphere :-)"
Romantic place,"For those who keen on books and reading it can be a place to stay for the whole day. There are lots of very cozy book shops with unique or just vintage books, like miss Oki's shop(on the picture)"
Bring your camera,Very quaint. Took me about 20 minutes t slowly walk through leafing through the books - not always in English. Close to the market 
Just love to see people appreciating books!,"I found this place online while I was planning for my trip. I was really happy to be here. Looking at people are still appreciating books. They are bookshops that do buying and selling. You name it, they (got to look around a few shops) probably have it! I also spotted mural painting and cute chairs around as well. There are also cafes around for rest too. If you love or appreciate reading through hard copy books, this is a nice place to just take a stroll "
Pretty cool!,"You should definitely take a walk through this claustrophobic alley. There are books staked floor to ceiling, and it makes an excellent backdrop for selfies. They are almost all in Korean, but there are a few classic English novels hidden away. Just south of Book Street is a big market area."
Nice find,"The street mainly sells second hand books, from textbooks to comics books and magazines. They are mostly in Korean but there are some English ones as well. It's more of an lane than anything and the books are neatly stacked up on top of each other like a wall. There is also a 7 storey Bookstreet cultural center, free of admission. The second and third floor are exhibitions and there is even a small cinema. Overall, a nice escape from the bustling shopping area nearby."
Interesting little hidden gem,"Someone in Busan mentioned Bosu Book Street to us and we decided to have a look. It is close to other, bigger markets (Jagalchi fish market) and nice to stroll around for an hour or so. The shops in this alley are filled with mostly Korean and English books. I found it a cool, quirky place and it is interesting to see how locals try to find the book they are looking for in these gigantic piles of paper.
