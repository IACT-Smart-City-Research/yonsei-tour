Large collection of artefacts showing Korean history from pre-history to modern times.,"The National Museum of Korea is located in a park not far from Yongsan Station. During my stay the museum was very quiet with a small number of visitors. Some space was closed for preparation of a themed exposition, the permanent exhibition was all open. It is worth spending some hours here. The Museum shop has a nice collection of items at different price levels. "
let you guide by a guide in the Museum,"I had one day off and went to the amazing National Korean Museum , a very, very large building which is similar to Musee d?Orsay in Paris, a lot of space. There I had a guide, it seems a lecturer from a university, he had a really broad knowledge. Okay his English needed improvement but the explanation he gave about Korean history was incredible. Moreover he knows a lot of culture.The Subway or Metro to the Museum is well organized. In the hotel they explained me how it works and with this information I bought a ticket and went into Korea underground. Stations are indicated in Korean and English so it helps otherwise Korean people are very open and friendly to show you the way . Do not throw your ticket away because at the end you get a refund of € 0,50 , very sustainable."
"Great little museum, and free! ","This museum is adjacent to the Gyeongbokung Palace, so it's very convenient to visit. There's a cafe in the basement for light refreshments. A comprehensive display of the Joseon Dynasty that lasted for 5 centuries. A pleasant way to spend an afternoon. "
Excellent place to visit,Wonderful place to visit. Worthwhile experience. Very well explained exhibits and easy to follow explanations
Very good & informative visit,"Sadly the app crashed and lost my review - good for kids- Timed, free entry for the kids museum, geared for 7 & under but no age limit.- free entry to the permanent exhibit- plenty of parking Recommend!"
Definitely worth a visit. FREE admission!,"One can easily spend a whole day here. The museum is well planned and layed out. The displays are well lit and presented with excellent information. The main exhibition areas are free (charge for special exhibits) and there are places to eat (museum cafe and museum cafe prices). It's just a really great museum and for the price it's a great way to spend a few hours, or to go back repeatedly (and in summer a way to beat the heat). I used to live in Seoul and would bring people here. I highly recommend this museum."
"Interesting museum, great restaurant and affordable souvenirs",This national museum has an interesting selection of exhibits and isn't so big that you get 'gallery fatigue' when you're only halfway through. The restaurant is good for traditional Korean food at a reasonable price and I found the gifts in the museum shop were attractive and very reasonably priced.
A world class museum,"You can divide museums into great, and not great. The great museums then can be divided into worth a return visit, and not worth one. The National Museum of Korea is a great museum that is unquestionably worth return visits.First the architecture: a large building divided into smaller units (i.e. children’s museum, library, exhibition hall). The exhibition hall has both permanent and special exhibitions. I only had time (almost three hours) to see the permanent exhibitions on the third and second floors, but didn’t see the first floor or the special exhibition. Regretfully I left my visit to this museum for my last day in Seoul.The exhibitions themselves are of the highest quality, using, among others, collections that were donated or bequeathed to the museum.Physically the exhibition halls are impressive, massively large with high ceilings. The explanatory text is interesting and fully translated to English.There are a few places to eat. I can only comment on the tea room on the third floor where I had an amazingly good cup of tea. There is also an extensive museum shop which is itself impressive. I left some money there, and would have left much more had I lived in Korea and not had to take fragile things on several flights."
Remarkable place to learn history of Korea,"The main building offerred free admission but don't miss special exhibitions at the library building (with extra fee which was worth the visit). I felt obliged as it was great enough to spend some money to support it. So, I bought some souvenir from the museum shop :) Easy to go there, just take a train to Ichon Station. "
Beautiful history ,We visited the museum while staying in Seoul. It is very well laid out and the displays are simply beautiful. Amazing that so much history has been preserved and acquired for people to see.Was particularly pleased to see so many school groups there.
Thoroughly recommended,So impressive how the museum is organised - you almost feel how it was like to live in ancient times. Need at least a day to do it justice......
A Beautiful Way to Spend an Entire Afternoon.,"My wife and I spent a lovely afternoon browsing through both the paid exhibitions (""The Etruscans-Rising to Rome"" and ""Through the Eyes of Joseon Painters"") and the first couple of floors of their free exhibitions.The hours just went by as we strolled through the many galleries, admiring the exhibitions.During my visit, as I was going through the ""The Etruscans - Rising to Rome"" exhibition, 3 boys were left on pretty much on their own and they were running around the exhibition, being a general annoyance. A poor female exhibition staff had a hard time trying to stop those 3 imps. This brings me to my one pro-tip: If you are bringing your kids, and I highly recommend that you do (there is even a children museum), keep them on a tight leash.Anyhow, the museum (inside and outside) is splendid. Unfortunately, we didn't have enough time to cover (or at least walk through) all its exhibitions."
Ideal place for ones who love to learn about history and culture,The national museum is a must-visit when you are in a country. This is big so you need about 2 or 3 hours to discover.
A nice museum,"This museum has many different Korean artifacts and artworks. The first floor focuses on pre-modern and early-modern history in Korea (though no modern history section). The second floor focuses on calligraphy and artworks, while the third floor is mostly porcelain pots. I would have liked to see more history, especially of the modern period, but overall the museum has quite a lot of artifacts and is very extensive. The museum is free to enter and can be accessed via the Ichon subway stop. Worth checking out if you are in Seoul."
Amazing museum,"This museum was amazing, the building itself is beautiful and there are many interesting exhibits, which helped us to learn more about Korean history. Lots of information in English, and very useful leaflets guiding visitors to key exhibits."
All about korean,"Puré culture, learning experience for all of us, bisedes, an special exhibition from europe, estrucos Was there"
History of Korea Before your Eyes,"If you have time, you should go to the museum. You can walk through the history of Korea, and depending on what's being shown, travelling items can be seen as well.They had the ""landscape"" painting exhibit when we went. They were also showing the Etruscan stuff - which we bypassed.New modern museum, layout of which reminded me of D'Orsay. It also has a food court to keep you from wandering off too far in search of food. Food actually passable as good, and are reasonably priced. Museum items was well worth the time spent, and is highly recommended."
Great for a rainy day,The museum is quite big and have many interesting exhibitions. Recommended for a family trip or for a rainy day.
A must see in Seoul,"A great place for museum lovers or those with a genuine interest in Korean history. The museum is housed in an imposing building surrounded by beautiful grounds. Entry is free to the permanent exhibitions. We were fortunate to arrive on a day where there was free entry to the visiting special Etruscan exhibition. Very easy to get to via the Metro, Ichon station, Line 4, exit 2 has a special pathway to the Museum itself. Well worth a visit, you could spend hours here."
Beautiful Museum,"Spent 4-5 hours here on a rainy day on my most recent trip to Seoul and still did not cover the entire museum. It's a beautiful space and highly recommend spending a half day (or more if you can) exploring. The grounds around the museum are beautiful as well, wish it had not been raining so I could've spent more time exploring the complex around the museum."
Museum ,Great museum and best of all it's free! Extensive Asian collection. They even have little robots for help if needed. Worth a day no matter the weather!
Excellent,Really impressive building with a wonderful and accessible collection. Could spend a few hours or days there!
This Museum is not boring,"Well organized, nice exhibition in a vibrant building. It is not ovecrowded even on a rainy day. Free entry is a plus."
Beautiful Museum,"Easy to access from metro line 4 (Ichon station exit 2) or bus (#502 or #400) this museum is well worth the visit. General entry is free (M/Tu/Th/F 1000-1800, Wed/Sat 1000-2100, Sun/Holidays 1000-1900 - closed Jan 1, Seollal, and Chuseok) and they offer guided tours in Korean, Japanese, Chinese, and English throughout the day. Exhibitions are displayed over three floors - a variety of galleries - prehistoric works, celadon, an impressive Iron Buddha - just amazing works. Worth a quick visit if that is all you have time for or one could spend hours just admiring the works. There is a nice gift shop, several options for tea or meals, and a children's museum on site (did not visit). I would highly recommend a visit to this amazing museum - can be combined with a visit to the National Hangeul museum and Yongsan park for a short stroll outside. Ichon is becoming a more developed neighborhood with plenty of places to eat or get coffee and about 1/2 a kilometer from the metro stop to the Hangang Riverside Park and paved trail that runs seemingly endlessly along the Han."
Truly world class,"I'm truly surprised by the number of museums and galleries in Seoul. The National Museum of Korea is a gem and a must see. The building is large an spacious with exhibited being well laid out. I've only managed to see less than 30% before it closed. I will be back again. I loved how they present history and culture. Korea, whilst smaller than China, is in her own right a very sophisticated country and unique in many ways. The gift shop is the best and biggest I've seen for a museum. "
Excellent museum,"We needed more time to take in all the history and artifacts this museum has to offer. We were not given long enough to take it all in, but learned a lot in the time we had.Definitely worth a visit."
Worthwhile for History Buffs!,"You could probably spend an entire day here, if not more! This is one of the biggest museums I've ever visited, but it's beautiful. It's very well curated as well. Keep in mind that unless Korean and Asian history is something of interest to you, this may not be your thing. As interesting as it is, it may be difficult follow along and grasp all the history that's being thrown at you. Nevertheless, if you just want to look at beautifully preserved artifacts, then this place is perfect for you. I remember walking into one room with a VAST collection of Buddha and Bodhisattva statues, I believe mostly from Korea, and they were just breathtaking. Absolutely enormous, with fine detail and descriptions nearby."
nice museum with interesting historical exhibits,nice museum with interesting historical exhibits.. nice to visit and learn about the past of this culture but also because of the cultural open air events
A nice Museum,"If, like myself you are not a great lover of large rambling 19th Century Museums, crammed with thousands of artefacts over umpteen floors and galleries , this is one for you!It's modern, it's light, it's airy and is just one long building with just 3 levels with a very ""constrained"" number of exhibits covering some quite precise subject areas. Entrance to the main collection is free.A little word of warning, in busy times the galleries are quite manageable, but don't be tempted to try the food hall!"
Nice place with good AC,"It was a muggy day when we visited as it’s been raining on and off. As part of the tour, we went through it within an hour. Could easily spend half a day if you’re into history and artifacts"
Will require some interest in historical art,"If you are into understanding and experiencing the evolution of Art, calligraphy and sculpting, this is a must do.If not, you’d better skip it.Very detailed collections of multiple era’s within the Korean geography. Surprisingly well kept. Especially the calligraphy from stone carving over papyrus to the first printed books.The museum souvenir store is a real gem."
Simply awesome,"This museum is big, and I mean big. There is so much to see within its walls that make sure you reserve more than one hour if you really want to focus on all of it.Sadly, as in every museum in Korea, Korean nationalism has embellished some of the history and left the nasty parts out."
Fabulous story of Korea,We love to visit National Museums when we have the opportunity. With only 2 days in Seoul we had to choose carefully how to spend our time. We are so happy that we began our first day at the National Museum of Korea. The displays were nicely presented with narrative in English which gave us insights and information to better understand Korea and the Korean people. This large and airy museum includes a 10 story pagoda. The directional flow from room to room is logical and easy to follow. Our 3 hour visit was fabulous. We highly recommend making the time to visit this excellent museum.
cultural icons,"For history and historical art lovers. A huge collection of Korean sculpture, furniture, calligraphy, painting.... impossible to see all in 1 day."
A look back in time,We love to learn about the countries we visit and the museum was a great way to do that. It feels wide open and uncluttered and is easy to get around. The gardens outside are beautiful and not to be missed. We didn’t eat here as it seemed expensive (like all museums) so bring snacks. My 12 year old was bored but my two 18 year olds love it. Have a great day.
A Random Walk Through the Korean Ages,"There are three great cultures in East Asia: Chinese, Korean, and Japanese. For at least the last two millennia, Chinese cultural influences radiated out to both Korea and (via Korea) to Japan. Westerners sometimes dismiss Korean art as imitative, but that’s not true. You might as well dismiss Italian Renaissance painting as simply imitative of Flemish, or Romanesque architecture as simply imitative of Roman. Each of the Far Eastern national arts is unique, and excellent. But I suspect even those with a strong interest in art and culture are far more familiar with Chinese and Japanese than Korean. So in terms of delving into artistic and cultural terra incognita, we Westerners would get more bang for the buck in the National Museum of Korea, than in either the Imperial Palace Museum in Taipei or the National Museum in Tokyo. All three of these museums are overwhelming, but Korea’s fine arts are the ones most likely to be a terra nova. You could spend a full day at this museum, standing in line when the doors open and being ordered out when they close, and still not absorb it all. I was astonished to see TA’s suggested duration as “2 to 3 hours” but felt better when I checked and saw their suggested duration for the British Museum was also “2 to 3 hours.” In fact: cheer up, curators of the NMK: TA’s suggested duration for the Louvre is “< 1 hour”! The curatorship of the NMK, by the way, is as outstanding as its collection: which was good news for me: I needed all the help I could get. Here are just a few things I’d recommend you look for:Plug ‘Em and Pot ‘Em: We do a lot of odd things to our dead. Egyptians mummified them; so did Chileans. Zoroastrians put them out for the buzzards to eat; so did Thais long ago. Eating them was the norm in New Guinea, New Zealand, and the Amazon. But as you wander through the NMK’s collection of Three Kingdoms artifacts (4th~5th century C.E.), be on the lookout for some huge red clay pots. Baekje honoured their noblest dead by jarring them. My mother used to preserve stuff in jars too, but it was apples and apricots, not ancestors. (See Burial Jars photo).A Really Old Boat: The best-known boat surviving from antiquity is the Khufu boat, which has an entire museum to itself, a baseball’s throw from the Sphinx in Gaza. It’s over 4000 years old and remarkably well-preserved, but was built strictly for mortuary purposes and never even got wet. The NMK’s got a real boat that’s twice as old: 8,000, not 4,000. You get to see what little remains of it, and a recreation. A humble canoe; no Pharaoh would have dreamed of stepping into it, but it would be thousands of years later before Pharaohs were even invented. I’m not sure we’d even gotten to antiquity yet when some stone-age Korean carved this canoe: Korean fauna back then included cave lions and woolly mammoths. I suspect the canoe hit a rock, got holed, and was abandoned by its owner as a now-worthless piece of junk. Little did he know that people would line up and pay good money to see it 8,000 years later (see Neolithic Canoe photo).Buddhas Explained: Naturally the NMK has a large collection of ancient Buddhas. I’ve mentioned the NMK’s outstanding curatorship. I particularly commend them here. I’ve been to national museums in China, Japan, and every country in Southeast Asia, and this is the first museum I’ve seen seen that explains each and every mudra. Whether they’re giant Buddhas or miniatures, all Buddhas do something with their hands. Each hand gesture has a specific meaning, but if you don’t know Buddhist sign-language, you can’t read them. The NMK provides you with an easy 10-minute course on what each one of them means, immeasurably improving your understanding and appreciation of what you’re seeing. After six years of wandering around Asia, I knew a few of them, but now I know five times more. A healing Buddha holds a medicine ball in his left hand, and not only heals folks, but saves them from calamities (in both Pure Land or Theraveda Buddhism, the “goddess of mercy,” Guanyin, does the same, and she also holds a bottle of medicine: see Healing Buddha). A different gesture indicates that the Buddha is dividing his disciples into nine different grades, depending on their religious capacity (see Grade-Making Buddha). The star of the collection, however, is a pensive Bodhisattva, one of the National Treasures of Korea (see Pensive Bodhisattva). The museum’s also got a brilliant 5-minute video on the building of one of the UNESCO world heritage site Buddhist temples in south Korea, broken capstone and all. Every NMK video is worth watching.Other National Treasures: Korea has an admirable system for identifying its finest cultural treasures. You’ll find quite a few of them in this museum. National Treasure 61 (NT 61) is a 12th century dragon-shaped celadon ewer (see Celadon Dragon); NT 191 is a golden “antler helmet” and girdle (see Antler and Girdle). Other NTs run the gamut from NT86, a towering ceramic pagoda that you can’t possibly miss (see Gyeongcheonsa Pagoda) to NT 89, a belt buckle that you could easily miss, but hopefully won’t: it’s made of over 50 grams of pure gold thread and granules, shaped into a large twisting dragon surrounded by half a dozen smaller ones (see Gold Belt Buckle). I used to have a belt buckle just like that myself: in my dreams! Be on the lookout for anything in the museum with an NT designation!I could have spent several days in this museum. Spending only one, I focused almost entirely on the Korean collections. However, the museum has important collections from other cultures, including Gandhara and Pala. Two items that definitely caught my eye were a bronze Greek helmet and a small but ornate Malay basin: small because it was used to give new-born babies their first scrub (see Greek Helmet and Malay Neonate Basin). If you’ve an interest in Chinese celadon, don’t miss the the Sinon Shipwreck Collection. This not-quite-hardy-enough ancient freighter was headed to Japan in the 1320s, ran afoul of a typhoon or faulty navigation, and wound up at the bottom of the sea off the coast of Korea. 1323 was at the tail-end of the Mongol dynasty (they went through seven emperors during that decade, each one worse that his predecessor), but China was still making first-rate china. Hence, a treasure-trove of Chinese celadon from as far afield as Canton: being glazed, thousands of pieces were in pristine condition. Personally I’d rate Sung celadon #1, T’ang porcelain #2 and Ming #3, but a ship-full of any Chinese celadon is a treasure-trove indeed, with a thousand pieces of metalware as a little something extra (see Sinon 1, Sinon 2, Sinon 3 and Sinon 4 photos).If you want to take a break, the museum has both a excellent tea-house and a restaurant. Be aware that if you order anything with “spicy” in its name, such as “spicy beef soup with black tiger’s paw mushrooms” it may be hotter-than-Hades spicy even by South Louisiana Cajun standards (see Spicy photo). Also note that the grounds around the museum are well-worth a stroll, with bridges and pavilions, gardens and carp ponds (see Museum Gardens photo). As with any other major world museum, what you bring to it will reflect what you take away from it. If you can do the Louvre in under an hour, 2 or 3 hours here will certainly suffice. If you’ve got young children, the odds are that that hall after hall of glazed porcelain will make their eyes glaze over. But for visitors with a real interest in Asian culture and art, I’d recommend getting there when the doors open, and sticking to it until they close. But then, I’d recommend spending a whole day at the Louvre, too."
National Museum of Korea,Nice place to explore! This large area with many historical things is great for knowing better korean history.
Very impressive museum building,"We had allowed a few hours to look around but you could easily spend a day in here if you wanted to take in every exhibit in the permanent exhibition and then the rest of the complex. There are three floors in the permanent exhibit and we ended up having to skip the entirety of the third due to time. Looking at the guide map there is also a Children’s Museum on the other side of the entrance auditorium, so definitely allow more time if you’re travelling with younger kids. The permanent exhibit is free although there is a charge for the rotating special exhibitions and Children's Museum. If you are spending a day there’s plenty of restaurants and cafes on site. We also passed a 7-eleven or similar store in the complex. The staff at reception spoke some English and there is also a helpful stationary guide robot with information in English.We got a taxi there and back but the museum is also connected to Ichon Station on the subway by an underpass."
A great overview of Korean history,"If you love museums and history, this is the place to go to. The place is new, massive, and has a great collection of Korean history. There are highlights of the collection, as it will probably take you more than a day to go through in detail through the entire collection. Highly recommended museum!"
Best layout of museums,We always go to the museum of the country we visit and this one was particularly good. The layout was amazing and seamless from one period to another. The space between exhibits were large so you won't feel crowded at all. There were plenty to see and read. We arrived 1 hour before closing as we rushed over from another museum. So we only did the ground floor and chose the important parts to see. The museum is free to enter for all. You can download the museum app and use it as an audio guide. You need to use your own headphones though as required by the museum.
The history of Korea from ancient times to the present day.,"Large, interesting exposition. A lot of information about the history of Korea, the royal dynasties, the life of the common people, crafts and traditions. Highly recommend! All national museums in Korea are free."
Book several hours for this museum ,"Very interesting museum. Tons of information and details. Great place to learn more about Korean history. I was jet lagged so could not fully enjoy this place. But I recommend to plan at least 2-3 hours to explore. In addition there is an amazing space in front of the entrance, or rather between the entrances. With a beautiful view to Namsan (sp?). See the photo. "
Lovely museum full of interesting history.,"I'm not sure if it's free for everyone, but it was free for us as part of the tour and it was a decent hour or so we spent in there. Very interesting to learn about the creation of the Korean writing system and more about Korean history that I didn't know. Useful going into my PhD in East Asian Studies."
National Gem Not To Be Missed,If time allows only one museum choose this one. Its free and hours vary depending on the day of the week. Look online at the official website. Skip the guided tour. English hard to understand and 1 hour spent on 10 items. Allow 3 hours plus time for any special exhibits. Download the app and bring your earphones. Well organized so numbered exhibits correspond to numbers on the app. Exhibits in English so easy to follow. Enjoy!
Dont bother if you dont have extra time,"Building itself is impressive. Exhibition boring and way too large, feels like you have seen these same green vases so many time. Seems to be popular amoung school groups. Children running around and acoustics make place noisy . "
Amazing,Free and worth visiting with Korean Dynasties and cultures.I luv the small cafeteria inside very clean and polite staffs
Enlightening,"Beautiful place, tastefully designed to remember and educate. It was quite emotional but very deserving. Learn and never forget!"
Fantastic,A great insight into Korean history. It has a wonderful display of ceramics. We had lunch at the restaurant which was delicious. A must see place to visit in Seoul.
Big museum with a well-spread of information about Korean history.,"The museum is big and has lots of interesting rooms with history of Korea. There is quite a great view of the N Seoul Tower from there and they have shops where you can buy souvenirs related to the antiques that you will see in the museum. I went to the museum on the weekend and I didn't have to pay an entrance fee, I guess the entrance is free on the weekends. You are allowed to take pictures of the different exhibition rooms they have but you are going to be requested to go through an X-ray security checkpoint before entering the hall where the exhibition rooms are. I highly recommend you to go to this museum if you are interested in the history of Korea and of course if you are willing to spend two to three hours there because the museum is huge."
Great place to learn about the Shilla People,After visting the site of thombs and their contents at the Gyeongju Ancient Tomb Complex we when to the musuem to gain more knowledhe of the Shilla People.The displays wete excellent and had descritions in English. Excellent!
A must stop for the curious and well informed,We have been to this museum on two seperate visits . it is well done and explains th rich history of Korea. It is easier to understand the culture with a history lesson from the museum. 
Very good & informative visit,"Sadly the app crashed and lost my review - good for kids- Timed, free entry for the kids museum, geared for 7 & under- traveling Happy inside exhibit was great!Recommend!"
A must visit.,"If you are visiting Seoul, there are three places that is must in my opinion. Gyeounbokgung palace, National Museum of Korea, and The War Memorial of Korea are the three, The first two will provide visitors with the sense of Korean culture, history, and the language that is unique to Korea. The last will give you an insight into the recent history of the nation that overcame the tragic and catastrophic events that were Japanese occupation, liberation, and Korean War. "
"It’s free and has a beautiful, large park!","It may not be quite as interesting as the War Museum (the best free museum in Korea), but it does get the silver medal. Great way to spend a few hours out of the sun or rain and when the weather is right, enjoy the large park outside. In fact the park is superb... mini-rivers and waterfalls, play area for kids, lots of green space and trees - great way to relax. Highly recommended... a very cheap day out!"
Must see,"I went there a few times and I really like it. They have a huge collection, including lots of porcelain. The museum itself is very spacious so be prepared for at least 2 hours of visiting. There’s a small park - like right outside the museum. And the entrance is free of charge.Sometimes they organize events for foreigners, like for eg making korean masks - only that costs extra "
Amazing place.,"Love the exhibits, the architecture and facilities at this museum. Please allocate ample time for this place, and do not skip the park."
Great museum for visitors and residents,"Visitors to Korea will love the extensive collection of Korean treasures, many of which have decent labels in English. (Something hard to find in Korea.) As a resident of Korea, I love that this museum gets special exhibits (like the ""Golden Man"" from Kazakhstan last year) and that it has a great selection of coffee and tea shops and a beautiful sitting area on the second floor. It's a spacious, beautiful museum and a world-class collection--for free! "
Full of Suprises,If you want to learn about Korea and its extraordinary history go to this Museum. My family and I loved it!Please try the cafe on the ground floor-beautiful!
Beautiful museum,"What a beautiful museum, and it is located within a short stroll of a subway station. Even though I am not well informed as to Asian history and artifacts, the museum is definitely worth a stroll -- and since admission is free, there is little risk for the benefit of expanding one's artistic exposure."
Wonderful Museum - well worth a visit,"Beautiful Museum with excellent displays of Korean Culture and History. Admission is free, and it can be accessed either through the Palace grounds or a separate entrance. Take the time to tour and visit."
Learn and free admission,I love this museum you will learn and appreciate korean culture and historyIt displayed Other south east asian countries artifactsFree admissionHas 3 floors and an indoor activity
Just fantastic,We are great fans of museums. This being said this Seoul museum is at the top of the pile. We usually. Is it from the top down ( fewer people do the upper ranges) and only completed the 2nd and 3rd floors in 3 hours.Th displays are well thought. Our highlight of a 7 stay in Seoul.
Spectacularly beautiful museum,"Was able to spend two hours here and wished we could have stayed all day. Not only are the exhibits fascinating, but the building itself is very beautiful. The architecture is modern and sleek, but not in a brutalist unfriendly way. The lighting inside the building was amazing, and the fixture are very technologically advanced. One of the most beautiful museums I have ever visited. There is a restaurant and children's museum there as well."
So Much History For One Day,"The National Palace Museum was housed in a massive building and was quite impressive as we walked towards it. The opening in the center framed a view of Seoul Tower in the distance.Outside in the sprawling park were various ancient lanterns, restaurants, a bell and a large pond. Inside were three floors of historical artifacts both curated and donated to the museum. We started on the third floor and worked our way down with the hopes of missing the large groups of school age children that arrived the same time as us. This worked well for the first hour. The third floor contained a large variety of Buddhist sculptures and various pieces of art from around Asia. Half of the second floor was full of donated collections and were a mixture of different eras and countries. Not that interesting to us. The other half covered the paintings and an amazing two story tall Buddhist scroll. Dynasties and even older Korean civilizations were covered in detail on the first floor. However, as this was a rather large museum we breezed through these displays as we were ready to get outdoors. Overall, this museum could be split into a 2 day visit to avoid history overload."
"Impressive building, interesting collections",It's a 40 minutes ride on the subway south from Insadong including a 10 minute underground walk from the stop to the main entrance. The vast building is impressive with great views of the Seoul Tower. The collections inside are excellent and well laid out. 
Early Morning Stroll,"I took an early morning subway ride to this place knowing that the Museum has an expansive grounds to stroll. Arrived 9AM and had a leisurely stroll around. Note that there are people jogging and they have small trails winding around pagodas and meditation nooks. It was so peaceful without the crowd and by noon it was already hot. The museum entrance is free and they have two special exhibits. The exhibits costs KW7500 and for people who has not much interest on it, I recommend you pass. The main museum artifacts are more than enough for a short visit (approx. 1 hr). There is a convenience store open prior to 10AM and I saw two restaurants that were still close when I left the grounds. I suggest coming early to avoid bus loads of kids visiting the museum."
I really enjoyed this museum,"This is a great museum. 1) its free 2) the grounds are beautiful 3) the museum store has very inexpensive and nice museum gifts 4) lockers for your stuff 5) many nice artifacts from Korea and other Asian areas. We did not go to any of the special exhibits as we were a bit short on time, but we had a great visit."
Staid and underwhelming ,"Possitives : N o doubt the museum's contemporary architecture is both modern and impressive and is set in very attractive gardens. The facilities are very adequate, there is free entry and the staff are pleasant and helpful. Negative: For such a modern, national museum....Boy, it was so tediously boring. Old school type of exhibition...just dated exhibits and artifacts in glass cabinets. No interactive fun here or anything to fuel the imagination . I fell asleep on my feet my the second floor. I should imagine incredibly boring for children . "
Extensive Exhibit of Asian Artifacts,"The museum is easily accessibly via the Seoul Metro. The grounds are beautiful with several restaurants and many places to sit and relax. There was no admission charge but there were charges for some special exhibits.This is a large museum and is well laid out with exhibits down the side of the main hallway on each floor. There is just too much to go into extreme detail but there is coverage of Indian, Chinese and Korean history and artifacts; all well presented and explained with many explanations in English for those like myself that had trouble with Hangul.My favourite was probably the ancient shipwreck exhibit which showed many artifacts.There were several souvenir shops. The restaurant Was very good. Reasonable price for a museum restaurant; the Bibimap (meat and vegetables mixed up with rice) was quite tasty.definitely worth a visit."
Good way to know some Koran Culture,"It is a bit surprising that there are many artifacts are relating to Buddhism including the multimedia shown how a marvelous shrine was shaped without a nail in ancient time. The engineering in their past few hundreds years ago was astonishing. It made me feel closed to Asia and proud of them.I visited the special exhibition about Five Hundred Arahants. The display was breathtaking, virtually an exceptional artistic arrangement. In that space, You felt like you were among them in that comfortable quiet space when the statues all had different expressions unique in each. It bestows you the sense of content and serene, a surreal feelings is very hard to describe. The acoustic arrangement with Arahants statues in other display room just amazing. It satisfied you not only the eyes, but ears, to be exact, even mind! When I left the room, I feel enlightened. :-)After all, there are lots to see, although quite lots of them purchased in few centuries ago. Properly this is one of the reasons why we should visit the National Museum of Korea, not to mentioned the well designed building and surrounding. "
Concrete over nature,"We were not able to enter the museum because we used up all our time playing outside and around the place. Although the building shouts CONCRETE, the setting is serene with nice pocket spots. There were pine trees that dropped lots of miniature pine cones that my little granddaughter enjoyed collecting - this is why we ended up staying outside."
Worth the trip,Free! Large collection of artifacts and free tours. If you don’t have time or just don’t to do a tour download the free app for a self guided tour.
Wonderful Museum!,"We spent about 2 hours at the museum, though you can easily spend a lot more time. We did not do the audio tour, but we did do a guide tour (in English) that lasted about an hour and highlighted some of the National Treasures in the museum. The guide spoke very good English and was very knowledgeable. We definitely recommend doing a guided tour if you can arrange to visit when they are available. The guided tour, like the rest of the museum, is free. Be sure to save time to explore the beautiful grounds outside the museum as well. If you are doing the free guided tour, then I would say give yourself 2 hours minimum at the museum, though we could have spent more time there if we had more time to spare."
Can spend a day here!,"An amazing collection or series of collections. It is well layed out asy access and all have English desriotions. Pick up a guide and headphone set, worth it."
Worth to go but slight disappointment,"We were told it is one of the best and had pretty high expectations. It was not so systemic as we expected. But at the same time, it gives some overview of Korean culture and history."
wonderful architecture,"The National Museum of Korea has a great amount of exhibits about the korean history. Even though the museum is free of charge and offers an app to get english explanations about some of the exhibits on your one cell phone not everything is explained. If you are not very familiar with korean history you'll easily get bored. But the place is worth s visit just because of the beautiful landscape, the architecture and the view of the N. Seoul Tower from the south."
Great Place in Seoul,"This was a great, free, way to spend a few hours while in Seoul. Easy access from the subway. Lot of good information and most descriptions on items/exhibitions are also in English, which was super nice. Plenty of places to rest inside and also had food options. Overall, great place to visit. "
Korean culture,"This is a beautiful place to visit when you come to Korea, know more about the culture of this county. Nice to visit"
This museum shows the high respect South Koreans have for their history,"From the elegant building itself to the depth of the collections to the attention to guest comfort - this is a world class museum. The displays (all with English signage) provide a sampler of the history and culture of South Korea. There are several places to eat both inside the museum and outside but on the museum grounds. Each floor has a couple sets of rest rooms, and places to sit and rest. As for getting there, subway access is easy; from the maps I saw, I was concerned we might have to walk across a large parking lot to get from the subway to the museum, but not so; there is a direct underground tunnel from the subway to the museum entrance plaza; although some walking is involved, it's comfortable and quiet. "
Best,When you stay in South Korea you need to visit this museum... it is really interesting and you will be satisfied for what you paid
Must Do for First Time Visitors to Korea,"This is a huge museum that tells the story of Korea extremely well. It has a wide range of artifacts dating back thousands of years, but also extending into the modern era. Plan on several hours at the minimum. "
An excellent window to the history of Korea.,"The place is highly recommended for a must visit, if you are in Seoul. You can reach here by Metro. Figure out your nearest metro station and reach here. You may have to walk a bit though."
Interesting,Such a nice spacious museum. Lots of artefacts/ statues/ some furniture. Wish there was more artwork.Very clean facilities. 
Dodge the School Groups,"This might be one to split into a few visits, as it's overwhelmingly large. Pick a few areas which strike you and dive in, then enjoy what's nearby. "
It’s free for a reason ,"The museum is in a wonderful modern complex with a huge building housing some artefacts from various ages. I’ll be honest, I like a museum but this one didn’t do it for me. I felt they struggled to fill it and what they had was interesting but nothing special."
Large Museum ,Took advantage of the free English speaking guide. She was knowledgeable and interesting but had an extremely soft voice so it was difficult to hear. Lovely building and interesting exhibits. Easy to get to on the Metro and well worth a visit.
Good for a picnic as well,"The museum with the most heritages in Korea.With amazing flower gardens and huge pond, it's good for a picnic as well as history learning.- As everyone knows, the entrance is free except special exhibitions.- I was surprise to see it opens seven days a week.- The varieties of items weren't as much as I expected. But, it's still huge.- Don't expect much of luxurious and fascinating treasures because former Korean kingdoms have valued something humble. On the other hand, there are delicate and mysterious master-made items. - The location is quite away from popular touristic areas. It's not crowded on weekdays.- Exhibition halls are well-maintained. You can watch most items just by moving forward. And there are quite enough resting areas.- Free lockers, coffee shops, restaurants, etc. Souvenir shop is must-visit. There are amazing merchandises.- In April, there were many maehwa(Japanese Apricot flowers) blooming in the garden. It seemed there were more people outdoors than inside. Taking a walk around the building is recommended when it's warm.- To the east, it's connected to Hangul Museum and Yongsan Family Park. Both are good to visit as well."
Impressive Museum,"This museum is really big, so be prepared to spend a lot amount of time there, especially if you're a museum geek. The collection is really massive and quite complete. "
Impressive museum worth visiting,"Even if this imposing museum is filled with exquisite artifacts, the unforgettable displays are set up in a way to be able to really appreciate and enjoy them. There are lots of benches to reflect upon and the explanations are well written. The lockers make it easy to store coats and bags, and there are many easily accessible bathrooms."
"Visually stimulating, inside and out","A beautiful and action-packed place to visit. The main collection is wonderful and free. The rotating exhibits will charge a fee, but they are also first-rate. Plenty to do for adults and kids. The grounds are also a must-see."
History and culture,"I have never seen such a huge museum before, I'm not abig fan of museums, but this one really is impressive. Not only that is big (make shure to give it half a day at least) but it is also well organized and interesting. It has a beautiful lake and garden in front of it and also a restaurant. I spent there my last day in Seoul and it was all worth it. "
Very modern and beautiful museum,"This is a flagship museum that offers many aspects of Korean history. The museum is located at Yongsan area, can be accessed by mRT and stop at Ichon Station Exit 2, walking 150m. The museum also has a separate museum for children with fee. The rest is free of charge."
Don’t miss this museum! ,After a week of touring South Korea I was wondering where I might see some treasures. This is the place. The museum is extremely large and beautifully done. Every piece has an explanation or at least a title in English. The collection is amazing and very well displayed. It is super easy to get there on the subway. 
Beautiful collection!,"Histories from centuries ago was well presented. common visitors like us (without any historical background) could follow through the era, and understand the evolution of korean civilisation. We missed the guided tour as there was no english tour on Monday."
Enriching,The cultural diversity and different sections in there that cover a variety of Asian countries are quite unique. 
 Great Collection in a Beautiful Space,"It was also free, at least the day I went. The interior of the building alone is worth a visit, and then it’s the home of a wonderful collection. "
Free to Visit and a lot to see,"This place is huge so unless you have all day, you need to be selective. Go to the Information desk on arrival. They will help you download an App with a description of most of the exhibits and if you have your passport or drivers licence with you, they will loan you ear plugs. Then it’s off for a wander. We thought the Museum shops were reasonably priced and far better quality than the tourist stuff for sale in Seoul generally. There are plenty of very clean toilets and café’s to make your visit comfortable. Easily accessible on the underground, well worth a visit, lots to see."
Exhibition,"Show the work rotation, depending on the management of the exhibition Both of Korea And items from other countries borrowed to exhibit The formatting is very interesting. Anyone who likes a museum should not miss it."
Korean history,Very good feedback and demonstrations of the people of Korea. The museum is clean and tidy. Good attraction to visit.
Mostly in Korean,"Entrance is freeHuge exhibition space with many floorsHowever, most of the descriptions are in Korean"
An insight into Korean Hhistory and culture,Sign up for a tour to get the most out of your visit. I visited the museum several times so see new exhibits. It's worthwhile.
Very educational!,"The museum is very big, full of interesting things. It's architecture is spectacular. There are tours in many languages and a lot of English explanations. The admission is free but some exhibits are charged. This is the place if you want to learn more about Korean history."
Absolutely Stunning,"The building housing the National Museum of Korea is, quite simply, stunning; it is worth visiting the museum just to admire the architecture alone - a wonderful example of modern design fitting perfectly into it's environment.Entry to the permanent exhibitions of the museum is free and brief guides are provided in a number of languages.Across the concourse from the permanent exhibition halls is that used for Special Exhibitions, for which there is a charge. We didn't visit the special exhibition.Within the permanent exhibitions there really is too much to take in on one visit and so we decided to concentrate on ceramics and pottery. In a nutshell, the First Floor covers Prehistory and Ancient History, Medieval and Modern History; the Second Floor exhibits Calligraphy and Painting and Donated Works and the Third Floor, Sculpture and Crafts and Asian Art.Exhibition halls are spacious, high ceilinged and well laid out. The areas flow into each other and sometimes there is a 'lounge' off the hall. There were lots of school parties there when we visited and there was plenty of space for the children to sit on the floor with their leaders and discuss what they had seen. The space here is enormous, it's hard to describe.There are at least two museum shops - good quality souvenirs, notebooks etc and one shop concentrating on offering discounts on items from previous exhibitions.There are good toilet facilities on each floor and a number of places in which to eat and drink. We relaxed at the Tea Rooms, enjoying a delicious ginger tea.Given more time, I think we might have taken an English language tour - there are six per day, four in the morning and two in the afternoon. The museum has a good website, so am sure that details could be found there.After you have finished in the museum, take a wander through the grounds until you come to the Pagoda Garden, worth a look.We thoroughly enjoyed our visit, it felt like a real privilege to see it and share in it. We would thoroughly recommend a visit."
Very well documented history of Korea,"The Korean history over the last 3000 years was very well documented and displayed at the museum.I was very impressed with the spirits of Koreans over the millennias, overcoming various adversities and human calamities! It’s adoption of Confucianism was critical for the development of the Korean Empire over the centuries. I was very surprised that the last dynasty of Korea lasted for more than 900 years, much longer than any dynasties in China the longest of which was about 500 yearsThe museum is also conveniently located near metro station.A must visit for all visitors who want to get a sense of the historical importance of Korea. "
Interesting!,"It's huge! You can see many historical artefacts, findings, collections, and learn about history, olden days culture and the tradition ways of korea. They have new exhibitions too. "
Try the Pagoda Restaurant while at the Museum,"We ended our visit on a Thursday (late night at the Museum) at the Pagoda restaurant. My friends all opted for the prix fixe menus (Korean and Italian) and thoroughly enjoyed. I decided on something different, the octopus bibimbop - and thoroughly enjoyed. It was more like a deconstructed bibimbop with the rice on the side, to be added. A really good variation on a traditional dish"
Hanguk History,"If you want to understand the history of Korea, this is the place to be. It is the largest museum in Korea which houses precious Korean cultural assets. You will learn the history of Korea from ancient times to the modern era. To get here, just go down at Ichon Subway station, exit 2. The subway is connected to the museum via underpass."
very comprehensive summary of korea's history,"The museum is very complete and modern, the exhibits in the first floor where specially appealing to me since I love history it shows a very detailed history of korea from prehistory to the modern times. The museum is small and may not have a whole lot of pieces in display, but mind you that for a country that has been looted and pillaged various times through the centuries, the museum collections gives a very complete image of the korean nation, highly recommend if you have the time"
"Amazing building, mediocre exhibition","Im gonna start of by saying that these sorts of museums are often not something I enjoy that much.With that said, I did not think the content of the exhibitions were that interesting. There was definitely some cool things on display. But also, it felt for me like 50% was different pots and porcelain. Which some might find interesting, but quickly gets incredibly dull in my opinion.But what really saves this place in my eyes is the building itself. Which is enormous and, I think, incredible both on the inside and outside with surrounding.Also, the museum is for free. So if interested, I definitely recommend going here and if you find the pots as dull as I did, atleast you will have the building to look at.Additionally, I did not take any tours. Audio nor guided, so maybe that would have enhanced the experience."
Impressive,Easily accessible by metro. Admission is free (unless you want to see the special exhibitions). I went there on a Sunday so there were lots of families with kids there. Quite a wide coverage of collection of different artefacts. 
"Huge museum, free entrance",Beautiful building with a large collection. Over the last ten years I have paid multiple visits to this museum and find myself returning to it often. The pictures I uploaded are from the temporary Goryeo exhibition in 2019
Not a must to go,"This is a place for people who knows how to appreciate historic artefacts - especially artefacts related to buddhism. Otherwise, I do not recommend this on your itinerary. Especially because the exhibits were rather niche. That said, it has a nice and clean environment. There were also 3 levels of exhibition halls. "
Very good,Finally got the time to visit this one yesterday. Specifically loved the paintings gallery in 2F. Worth a visit. 
Fantastic,This museum claims to be the biggest in Asia by floorspace. It may not be true but it is certainly big. The art displays are excellent. There is a good restaurant.
A to Z on Korea History,"As a foreigner, I have been following Korean history. Not through the book but by watching Korean movies. Goreo, Joseon. All make sense via easy arrangement of the exhibition halls. Anti-clockwisely, it explains Korea history from early to modern. "
Just beautiful and extensive collection of historical artifacts.,"Easy to go to as there is an access from the train station. Extensive collection of historical artifacts. I learned a lot. Download the app for an English guide, which was so helpful. Visit their garden around the museum. "
Beautiful building,"This was a nice place to spend a rainy morning. The galleries are manageable in size, and the collection is impressive."
A must!,"Short walk from the subway station. Easy to find. A lot of stuff to see and you really get a good picture of Korean history. Remember to grab a map before you explore the exhibitions, so you won' get lost. The museum itself is really pretty and the architecture is wonderful. The view at the top is also cool! Has lockers where you can put your stuff during the visit.The museum was almost too interesting as I found myself walking around the building for the third hour."
a good place to learn about the history of korea,about a 5 minutes walk from the subway station. the experience along this walk was quite impressive! admission to the museum is free so that's even better! signages are in english and overall easy to walk around in the museum
Interesting Museum,The museum was a very interesting look at the development of Korea over the years. The gift shop provided very good gifts to bring home to family.
Definitely a must visit!,"First of all it’s easily located at the entrance of the train station exit. Probably a 5min walk once u exit the train barrier to the exit.Secondly it’s free of charge. There is no fees and you get 3 stories of viewing. Probably taking you about 2hrs to complete finish walking and looking through all the displays. However not all the explanation for the displays are in English. At the basement there is an activity for the kids to trace & colour king Sejong face which could keep the kids occupied for awhile. The facility is very clean, neat and nice. Definitely an activity for all ages.Thirdly visit this location as u watch the palace guard change ceremony which is located directly 500m in front of the museum entrance. Which is free of course, all the ceremony explanation are done in 4 major languages so u understand what is going on."
Amazing History,Three story building housing many artifacts that give a full history of Korea from early time. Reach easily by bus.
"Definitely worth a visit, very interesting to learn about Korea's history","Wonderful museum, can easily spend a lot of time here learning about Korea's history. Signs are in English on the exhibitions and there is a lot to see. The museum is free and also provides free luggage storage and free lockers, great for tourists. There is also a resting area in every few halls to take a break or wait for others in your party to catch up. Would highly recommend a visit here if you are traveling to Korea. "
Free to public and comes with app,"It was an easy jump from Incheon and my first stop during my day-long layover. The regular exhibits are free to the public plus there is a free app that acts as a docent to lead you through the museum, to save artefacts of interest, and search must-see artefacts. There is a restaurant on the 3rd floor to avoid the busy small cafés in front.The museum is 100% wheelchair friendly, however it sits on top of a small hill. To me, it was worth the climb."
Korean Culture immersion at its best!,"Being able to learn about the country that I truly admire is one of the greatest feeling and probably achievement. This had made me appreciate more about Korea, its people and culture."
Worth visiting,Located in a large open area this building houses the evolution of the Korea. Everything is organised and the building is a modern spacious place. Very interesting and would definitely recommend it. 
2 incredible days full of wonder and learning,"Loved this place, spent 1 whole day on the 1st floor with history of Korea and 1 day on the 2nd and 3rd floor. It is free, there's decently priced food (including a vegetarian meal) and it's just a beautiful, superclean modern building with so much well-presented information. Incredible!"
WOrth Visiting,went to this place before we entered the palace since it is also located in the same area. maximum time allotted is 1 hour. please have a tour guide to explain minuet details to make the display items more interesting. 
Free and beautiful,"A beautiful building, with plenty of areas to rest and recharge. There is so much to see and learn about Korean history. Nice displays, although some were dark. The donated collections were impressive. The grounds are a wonderful respite from city living. "
World class museum of Asian art ,"I’ve been to most of the major museums in the world and this museum has the finest collection of Asian art hands down. The focus is on Korean art but there are also strong exhibits with Japanese, Chinese, Vietnamese, Cambodian, East Indian, Lao, Thai, Indonesian, Mongolian and Filipino art as well. Admission is free. If you go on a weekday in the morning you will likely encounter bus loads of school children in the museum. So if you prefer a more quiet visit you may want to go on a weekend or in the afternoon (the kids seemed to be getting tired after around 2pm). Guided tours are available. I eavesdropped on a few different tours and they were extremely informative. "
History,Love it here. They have the show in sections. from the dynastys till the modern era. Have audio in English also. 
Great way to learn rich Korean history,"A great way to learn Korean history. The history reveals itself before your eyes when you cover the ground floor. The art section on the first floor enhances the awe factor and very mesmerizing! The displays are well-arranged and flows very nicely in alignment with history. Right from the 3- kingdom period to the Unified Silla, Goryeo to Joseon dynasties. The section on Joseon Dynasty will leave one with wonder and intrigue: it's a one-stop destination to learn about the interlinked history of Korea, China and Japan in the early Medieval and Medieval period. It's so enlightening to know that Korea has richer and older culture compared to contemporary Japanese culture. Must visit place in Seoul!"
Incredible place,Very interesting. Learned a lot about Korean history and its wonder people. Great place to go and wonder around for a few hours. Lots of historical stuff to see. 
Modernized museum with well-organized exhibitions.,"The museum is located near subway Ichon station. It is a modernized museum with gardening surroundings. The admission fee of the special exhibitions are around 6000, but the permanent exhibitions are free of charge, and they are worthwhile enough to visit. You can see well-organized artifacts of Korea throughout the history. There are also many precious artifacts from other areas, such as China, Southeast Asia, and West Asia. And the special exhibitions are of even better experience. We visited the the Joseon Dynasty Maps exhibition, which showed the history of Korean people making maps of Korea and even the whole world. The exhibition is very well-organized with many technological designs. You could scan the code to see the AR effects of the map with your mobile phone. Many local people found the places they were familiar with in the ancient map. The visitors were really having fun!"
Top quality museum experience,"We were super impressed with the National Museum of Korea. There are so many good points to list: - Beautiful, interesting artifacts chronicling Korean history - Well laid out - Gorgeous contemporary building, very spacious - Excellent English translations - Free entry - Open late some nightsWe spent two hours here. We saw all of the first floor (Korean history) then did a very quick lap of the second & third floors. The grounds really are gorgeous!"
Beautiful museum ,Free entrance and it is an interesting museum for all ages ... The other building is payable. It’s a good place when it rains ... 
Plan to spend the day,"This place is amazing, i went twice, each time spending 3 hours looking around and i still didn't see the whole museum. More than just a building with great artifacts you can also walk the ground that have a waterfall and genuine 1000yr old statues. Even if museums are not your thing, the view alone is worth the trip. TIP: they are open until 9 on Wednesday and you can see Namsan tower from the top of the museums steps"
Beautiful architecture ,And I was very impressed by the Silla artifacts. There were 3 special exhibitions at that time which I was not able to explore. 
A very good museum,"It is a heritage museum where you learn about the culture of South Korea, Entry is free and this is one of the best free museums I have ever visited."
Great place to visit and learn,On the way back from the DMZ spent a few hours hours here. Its free and a great place to learn all about Korea. Simply put its a great visual learning opportunity and well worth the visit 
Cultural and Heritage Museum,If you are into Culture and Heritage it is ok. The visit can be combined with a visit to the palaces in the area.
gorgeous museum,"Lovely surrounds and beautiful colleciton. I spent many hours here. Aside from a lot of loud and boisterous schoolkids, it was nevertheless enjoyable. "
Excellent place and a must visit,"Done up and managed very well, it is worth a visit for sure. Take your time moving through the exhibits- plan about 3-4 hrs"
Grand central hall with lots of other cultures represented,"The museum is a fair bits walk uphill from the closes metro station. The giant pagoda inside is incredible. Lots of other cultural possessions inside from China, Mongolia, Rome, Japan to name a few. Very popular spot for schools and you'll see lots of children and their teachers all over. Overall it wasn't as impressive as I thought. The War Museum is a better choice with more ""interaction""."
Worthwhile visit while in Seoul,This is a huge complex with many interesting exhibitions. Highly recommend. You need a few hours to really soak it all in.
Museum,Great museum to spend time in. It has interesting exhibits to look at and we could spend hours in there.
Beautiful museum with really interesting exhibits,"This museum was on our list to visit while we were in Seoul and we were so glad we did. It was easy to get to by local bus which stops right opposite the main entrance. The building is stunning and beautifully designed, spacious and filled with natural light, and the gardens and mirror pool are equally impressive. We were too early for autumn colour but the trees should be even more beautiful in a couple of weeks.The museum is free so it was busy with many groups of schoolchildren visiting on the day we went. But there are 3 floors with many exhibition rooms so it’s easy to avoid the crowds. The exhibits include periods of Korean history from prehistory to the Korean empire and sections covering traditional Korean crafts. There are also sections covering Asian art from China, Japan, Central Asia and India. It’s easy to spend a couple of hours here. We also had a wander around the lovely gardens. There is also a small food court and a shop.Well worth a visit."
Pleasant Surprise ,"During our visit, a special outdoor exhibition of traditional dance and music was preformed at the outdoor amphitheater, which was an unexpected added attraction to a very interesting museum. Two special exhibits plus the museum’s 3 floors of Korean art and artifacts kept us busy for several hours. "
If it is not on your bucket list it should be,"For once I found myself with a day to enjoy whilst on a business trip to Seoul. Usually imy visits comprise of the traditional airport, taxi, hotel, taxi, meeting, taxi cycle.Braving the immaculate Seoul underground helpful locals and clear signage meant I arrived without misadventure. Simply look to connect with the light blue line 4 and get of at Ichon, the covered walkway is well signposted and brings you into the beautifully manicured park surrounding the impressive museum.Entry to the main museum is free, but you do have to pay a nominal amount for special exhibit halls. The ground floor is laid out chronologically with exhibits starting from from Neolithic times all the way through to the modern day. I recommend you spend some time studying the timeline mounted on the wall at the entrance, particularly if like myself, you have limited knowledge of Korean history. The exhibits are beautifully presented and most have a good English language explanation. I am not sure how long I spent wandering from era to era, probably about three hours, but I was so immersed it didn't really matter. With hindsight I should have done some background reading as my head was struggling to piece all the information together. Second floor was focussed on art and ceramics with the third floor furniture and similar. First / ground floor requires the most time.There are cafes on each floor but are limited to mainly cake and coffee. There is a food hall but it was a little too busy so I gave it a miss. Spent thirty minutes sitting in the sun before walking around the mirror lake to visit the National Hangeul Museum. This is an absolute must if you want to piece together some of what you have seen in the main museum.Great day out, free entry too and an awful lot of new knowledge to be fascinated by"
The highlights tour of the museum was very good,"My husband and I visited this museum on a cool raw day and enjoyed the free tour in English of the collections highlights (we were the only ones at 10am.) Our tour guide was hard to understand but was a Korean history major, so he knew a great deal about the pieces he was showing us and Korean history in general. The stone pagoda, golden tiaras/belts and the pottery at the end are beautiful. The Museum gift shop was one of the best we found in Seoul, very reasonable prices, esp. the postcard set of 25 for $10. The reflective glass makes it hard to take good photos of some items. Compared to other Seoul attractions, the museum is quiet and spacious (built less than 25 years ago.)"
WOW!!,I loved going to museum when going to difference places. I learnt alot of news things when visiting museums. There are alot of exhibition showing in October. I remembered there was exhibition on Joseon dynasty. Very educational for my brother and I.
Fascinating museum,"We visited on a chilly, foggy, autumn morning which was the perfect kind of day for a museum visit. The museum is huge but is surrounded by gardens which are worth exploring. On entering you are immediately taken by the ceiling's design and the architectural simplicity of the exhibition halls off from the main rectangular atrium which has exhibits along its length. We spent a lovely couple of hours observing the many exhibits, my favourite being the rooms containing a variety of buddhas from across Asia. Definitely worth a visit, especially on a grey day, especially as its free.If you are heading elsewhere afterwards by bus, have a look for the shelter of memories, which is a bus stop on the main road outside with tile memories (in Korean) embedded among the bricks - quirky - I just wish I knew what they said!"
History ,"A place where history and art meet together It's definitely worth the visit , well arranged, places to eat and relax after you view the artwork I like it "
Comprehensive Collections,"Note: when you arrive there, you will see 2 entrance (one is on the left, the other is on the right). Make sure you go to the correct entrance (the right side). The National Museum of Korea is free of charge. The other entrance needs to pay. The museum showcases Korean culture from Paleolithic era until recent times. Each era or each kingdom artifacts are located at different area. Be prepare to spend half a day here as the collection is huge. If you are hungry in between gawking at the wonderful collections, there are a restaurant and a convenient shop in compound. "
A good trip but I think they can do more,The architect of the museum is so high. I love this and try to go all the rooms. I dont realize the story of the museum.
Fantastic museum with so much to see,I went to the Museum not knowing very much about the history of Korea. This is a great place to start with all historical pieces accompanied with English notes. I spent the whole day hetr and enjoyed the scene and architectural structures all around.
Main museum in korea,If you happen to go to korea and is short on time or want to have a relaxing time be sure not to miss this place.If you need to see old tradition or you want to have a good stroll it covers all of those.Be sure to put it in your agenda when you visit Korea.
Lovely Museum,"Realy nice museum which will give you a lot information about Korean art and history up to app. 1910. They have a great app, which you should download before you start your tour"
Fabulous,"the Museum is free which is great for a traveller on a budget!the lay out of the museum is great and easy to follow and the exhibits are fascinating and a great insight into the history of Korea, the art collections and other great exhibits. I saw every exhibit in around 3/4 hours so it took up a good portion of my afternoon. The subway station is so close as well as having a cafe and convenience store just outside. the gift shop was a little pricey but that was to be expected. "
Magnificent site,Great displays and beautiful architecture. The water feature outside shows the magnificent setting to its best.
A night getaway in the heart of Seoul,"The property is huge in the middle of Seoul, with its garden extends over the area. Interesting architecture of the museum, wonderful dining experiences at the Korean restaurant, and you can stroll in its amazing garden for a while. "
Many historical artifacts,Huge space. Impressive presentation. Extensive displays of pottery and related artifacts. The permanent displays are free. Special displays have minimal admission fees.
Nice but not really thrilling,"As Corea suffered wast devastation in up to three wars during the ladt century, there is not that much left to be exhibited, although exhibits are carefully presented in a very modern building."
Must see Museum ,"Fantastic museum from the outside in, well set out with stories, photos, artefacts and displays. Great start to those wanting more knowledge about Korea’s ancient past. "
Enjoyable visit,"Went to The National Musuem of Korea. It is in a beautiful setting with plenty of room for everyone. There was a free concert on when I arrived, playing great jazz. The guy playing the saxophone was great. The Musuem is always worth a visit. Everything is beautifully displayed. Lovely food and iced Citron tea in the tea room. Excellent Museum shops selling a real variety and good quality merchandise."
Loads to see,"The largest museum in Korea, it contains key artefacts that tell the story of the country. There are also educational and cultural assets here meaning there is something for all."
A museum to greatness,"I loved this visit, as I was impressed by the view of the museum both inside and outside. Nice and informative and a good outdoor area to take pictures of military hardware like missiles."
Inspiring,"Good place to get to know about Korea's history well arranged, equipped and maintained take a tour and enjoy the visit"
Worth Seeing,"This is a very large museum. The number of artifacts they have collected is astounding. You learn so much about Korea’s fascinating history. I’d recommend a couple of hours to visit this museum. They have many English written descriptions for the displays and exhibits. If you’re interested in learning more about Korean traditions and history, then this is a must see museum."
Helpfull site,"Loved the museum, so much to see there, lots of information given on this beautiful country, must visit again."
Decent visit,"Need at least an hour. Ground floor is interesting with the history of Korea, otherwise 70% of the exhibition just all pottery....train station n bus nearby. It’s free but special exhibition is charged at 9000+"
Informative,There are plenty of reading materials that they provide in different language as well and it's all for free. They even have these stamp pad that you can roam around and complete as you go along the way. It's amazing seeing them in person as we always see it in the korean tv shows and movies. 
An excellently maintained free museum,"The architecture is stunning, the staff helpful, and the exhibits themselves interesting and informative. I got the audio-guide and I spent an entire afternoon roaming through the museum. I think those with an interest in history would certainly enjoy it. The museum itself is very well-maintained. This is one of the best free activities I've ever done."
A must,"Well organized and very instructive, it helps the visitors to orient themselves in Korean culture and history. "
Good place to beat the weather ,"Great activity for hot, cold or rainy days. This place is massive and contains a wide array of artifacts from Korea’s history. This place does tend to get crowded, especially during the summer heat. Getting there: Metro Line 4, Ichon was station exit 2 will take you directly into the museum. Inexpensive snacks at the CU onsite. I had Kimbop and water for 3,000W."
An absolute must!,"The stunning modern architecture hides an amazing range of outstanding displays and historical information about the history of Korea. Several levels of artefacts, pottery, art, jewels, recreated moments of history and paintings are some of the wonderful displays that will take you at least half a day to truely appreciate. The garden is also beautiful. Cafes and a food store fill the hunger void and a wonderful little restaurant can be found just as you come up out of the subway. An absolute must when in Seoul."
Lovely Architecture Of The Museum But The Exhibits Can Be Better,"The design of the museum is lovely. However, the exhibits can be much improved. We were unfortunate to have visited the museum to coincide with a school visit. With kids out of control, the museum became a market place of voices and vandalism. My heart goes to the museum staff trying to handle these kids which by right should be under the teachers supervision."
"Great collection of art,history,present and future",Wow! Great experience and lots of things to see.Clean.Well-organized. Amazing artwork.Joyful and beautiful landscape.Lots of space.Explored and learned.Thank you for all the people who make it great place of learning and rest.
Fantastic building in great landscape ,Really enjoyed our visit. The building is spectacular and the landscape / grounds fantastic.Exhibitions are good. Disappointingly not so much around Korean War and modern history. Perhaps that’s in another museum. There’s a gorgeous area in the grounds worth walking around and finding - Dragon Pond. Absolutely beautiful oasis. 
Learn about korea,By this museum we can learn and understand about korean people. We can take the photo inside the museum but not alllowed to using flash
Huge museum with good open hours,"The museum itself is huge, free of charge, today works till nine o'clock.It has many objects, shop, lockers, clean toilett etc."
Need a full day,We only spent part of a day here. You need more than a partial day as we did not see a lot of the Museum. I highly recommend seeing the Budda section.
Interesting Museum,Large museum with lots to see. We spent a whole afternoon here. Easy to get to on the underground. The Buddhas were fantastic. Also has a great outdoor garden area.
There's a lot to see,"There's a lot to take in in this museum and I will admit my favorite part was finding cool art prints in the gift shop. There's a lot of pottery, but many other things too. I especially enjoyed the large Buddha statues. "
Huge building,"The building alone, along with it's vast gardens is worth a look but once inside, you could spend a whole day. Wonderfully displays depicting the history with plenty to keep the kids interested too."
Feed Your Brain,"I visited National Museum of Korea 10 years ago. If you love history, artifacts and arts, then this is a place you must visit. The museum has everything you need to know about Korea's history. "
Seoul vacation,"It was our last day in Seoul and our trip was in the afternoon. Since we have been shopping and food tripping for 3 days, it was about time to learn some history. Very impressive building, informative, and entrance is free. It’s a must see before you leave Seoul. "
Hidden jewel,"This was a last minute plan. We took the metro and the museum is right there. Free entrance and free guide. Our English speaking guide was a gentleman in his 80’s with a great passion for his country and history. The highlight of my trip was the statue of Sidhartra as a young Buddha in the moment of enlightenment. This bronze statue was casted 1400 years ago, the special smile of the character is unique. Our guide told us: “ if there is a Korean souvenir that you want to take back home, is that smile on your face”. And with that his tour concluded. There are other treasures worth visiting."
Excellent Museum. Very large and free,"If you like history and museums. A must visit. A very large museum and very very clean. Free entry. Only special exhibits are paid. Their 'tea shop' on 2nd floor (at the rear) has excellent and delicious local tea. Reaching the Museum is very easy. You can take Line 4 (Jungang Line) to Ichon station. Just follow the signs and there is an underground walk way (air conditioned) which takes you directly to the entry steps of The Museum. The grounds outside are also very beautiful. If it is NOT a warm day, you can spend time siting in the grounds as well. If you have the time, you can spend the full day here. It is better to see the Museum on your own rather than the free guided tours (one hour). Routes and directions in the Museum are clearly marked and the exhibits have a very elaborate writings and information. "
Amazing and fascinating ,"Highly recommend! I would definitely recommend a guide. There is a lot of amazing content. We hired a personal guide, and it was entirely worth it. The guide drastically amplified the experience. Even if you don’t have a guide, it’s still going to be worth while. I’d plan on 2 hours per floor. We split it up in 2 days. "
Amazing Museum,This was truly one of the best museums we have ever visited. Extremely well laid out. Fascinating. Took the subway there. Just a short walk from the stop. The museum is laid out in chronological order of the history of Korea. Learnt an awful lot. 
Hidden Gem,"There is not much hype on the Museum so we did not plan to visit it at all. In fact, it was only because it was located directly opposite the palace and we had some time before our appointment with our guide, that we decided to pop in for a look. Entry is free. There are lockers that require coins to rent but the coins are returned after you unlock the lockers.What we saw was mostly the history of Korea; the opinions on how it came to be, how it developed and so on. It was very interesting. Cater about 2-3 hours. We rushed through it in less than 1 hour and regretted that we did not have more time to spend there."
AWESOME,The place is beautiful! i have been there twice and I still feel in awe with the beauty. the collections are nice.
National Museum Of Korea,"My only problem was that the day we went, it was filled with school kids. Still had a good time but will go again."
3 levels,"We visited the National museum of Korea on a Sunday. The place was crowded. The museum was a 3 levels place. The 1st floor was all about history and the 2-3 were all about culture and art. The Brochure was available in Korean, English and Arabic. The museum was worth the visit, every corner was well maintained and every item was well taken care off. You will surely need to visit it for yourself. There was a nice and cosy café on the 3rd floor. I had my favorite mixed grains cold drink with rice cookie. The drink was nutritious and cold. SEE photos."
Impressive!,"This is a new museum, with a great collection of korean art. THe building itself is impressive, and the lightniung is great. A nice pagode gives way to the museum secrets."
Lovely Modern Museum ,"I enjoyed this Museum it was close to the Gyeongbokgung Palace, walking distance.The admission was FREE The Museum was clean and modern. History of Seoul, South Korea all the stages the country has been Thur.I enjoyed the pictures and props and videos that they had.If you enjoy history definitely come here."
Best Museum,"This museum is just beautiful!!! Huge, well laid out, architecturally stunning. We took Free English tour. Since there is so much ground to cover I highly recommend the tour as it highlights some MUST SEES. 90 minutes long it goes quick but provides interesting insights. Even my 10 year old was enjoying it!"
A great introduction to Korean History,"This museum was very well laid out with the ground floor dedicated to the history of Korea up until the early 20th century. I only had a few hours so I spent the majority of them there so didn't get a chance to see the rest of the museum, but I had a quick glimpse of the first floor which had a calligraphy and art section."
New and grand,"A good place to bring high school students to visit the museum. However, no information about the Korean War which we are very interested to know more."
"Beautiful museum, but needs more filling out","This museum is my favorite museum in Seoul, with a vast array of artifacts ranging from ancient times to the era of the Korean War. The museum is educational for learning about the history of Korea, something which is mostly ignored in Western education. Many of the rooms are not filled to capacity, but the museum is spread out enough that there is plenty to see. The top floor has exhibits on Asian history in general, encompassing more than just Korea--I found these more interesting. There is also a large quantity of pottery and calligraphy throughout the museum. Admission is free, and while an audio guide is recommended, I found it cumbersome and unnecessary. Many of the items have English labels and an English map is available. "
Download of korea history (till the formation of korea),"The museum offers a decent download of the history of Korea, till the formation of modern Korea. Sadly you wouldn't get to see anything like the impact of World War. Alot of stuff are touch and go, but that is understandable because Seoul also hosts many other related museum such as the National Palace Museum of Korea. As an arsent museum goer, it is just a pity that this museum is not a ""one stop shop"".The key exhibits are in the first floor. The 2nd and 3rd floors houses some arts pieces of Korea and artifacts of the world respectively. I personally think that you may give these 2 upper floors a miss it time is a constraint - I can see effort in the curation, but the collection, especially on general world, is quite thin. I spent a total of 4-5 hrs in the museum. Entrance is free!"
Great,"I won't tell anything but suggest all to come here visit and get yourself to learn about the country. Cool place, one of the must-go "
truly world-class,"i can tell you from extensive travel experience that this museum is a work of wonder. the architecture, organization, presentation and landscape already make it a great place to visit and adding to the fact that it showcases the best of Korea for FREE is a great way to learn and appreciate Korean history/culture"
"A treat, worth visiting","The architecture is great, the way the rooms and lighting (both natural and electric) really highlight the art.There is enough on display that everyone should find something interesting, i was delighted to see the cultural influences of surrounding countries as that aspect is often skipped.I would recommend a visit."
Such a great museum - World class,"We enjoyed this peaceful, amazing architecture and all of the many wonders within. You can see so many different periods of Korean history here. From the famous ""Turtle Boats"" of the 10th century through the Korean War and beyond. A balance focus on events and culture. Really a treat."
A very good option when visiting Seoul,"Subway Line 4 will take you there. Just follow the sign and then walk along the long corridor, you will soon reach the museum.Very spacious and the environment is quite good. Quite true, it’s a bit cool in the sense that there are not too many people and the space itself is quite overwhelming.Good collection on Buddhist paintings and sculptures. Must see.Some nice restaurants. Good for spending a few hours there. This is my second time visiting the museum. Think I’ll still go back."
Huge disappointment,"We were so looking forward to seeing Danwon and Hyewon paintings in this museum. It was easy to take matro line 4 to get there. Walking through air conditioned tunnel, we thought it is a great design to avoid the sun light. The museum campus is quite big, well maintained and free admission. We asked front desk where are the paintings displayed. The answer is ""they are in the storage room, not in exhibit. We don't know when they will be shown""."
Huge museum ,"Massive museum that is worth a visit - mainly Korean objects but some Asian (particularly Chinese) as well. Plenty of English explanatory notes, and videos and the apps are nice supplements. Layout is reasonably good, and one can easily spend half a day there. Admission is free but tickets needed for special exhibitions. Not many visitors, and somehow the museum seems to be a bit ‘cold’ and not very engaging. "
Not a must-do but not bad,It's big museum with an extensive collection of archeological finds and art. Furthermore it's free. There is only limited information on the more recent developments in Korea for which the History Museum of Seoul is a better choice.
"Free, many exhibits, best for the history buffs","The National Museum of Korea is connected to the Ichon Station (Line 4) and a comfortable walk both to the museum and within the museum. While it is a big location with multiple artefacts to keep you occupied, I will first warn that most of the permanent exhibits are of art and archaeological digs, making the museum cover more about what Korea was hundreds/thousands of years ago more so than what South Korea is now. If that is what you want to see, then the Museum is a great place to be in, otherwise I suggest you take the time to explore Seoul's other museums/districts which would talk more about people's present lives.Otherwise, its free and an appropriate location for wet weather. There are also special exhibitions you can pay for and the National Hangeul Museum in close vicinity so you can easily spend a few hours here."
Nice and free!,"Travelers are always looking for interesting and stuffs, and this is one of them. You will learn a lot of Korean culture and helps to understand their traditions. The only inconvenient was the restaurant, which didn´t sell me a coffee and a cake, they ask me to have a complete meal to get the service."
Not much to see,"There is not much too see compare with other museum in Seoul. Don't think there is value to visit if you have not much time in Korea,"
National History,This massively impressive building in Seoul is home to a lot of South Korea's History. The building is made up of three floors and is spilt into a number of different chambers dependent on time periods of various kingdoms/empires including the Japanese colonisation period. There is however a lot of information so I would recommend either spilting your visit into a number of hours with a break in the middle or possibly a couple of day's. There is also a museum shop with lots of different gifts and also a cafe and a large exhibition/amphitheatre area just outside the building where they play music and perform. And best of all its free and easy to get to by subway or bus.
Good but general,"If you got your history classes in high school (EU students), then most of the information obtained here is repetitive. Nevertheless, it does generally specify on Korea. I would recommend the war museum whocj gives the same information but more specified on their own korean history. "
Nicely organized,This is a nicely organized museum. Exhibition is arranged according to chronilogical order. Going through the exhibit halls and rooms taught me a lot about the history of Korea. I may be wrong but the artifacts often looked like recent replicas. 
Huge fairly new museum.,Built in this location in 2005. It’s huge. So easy to get to from the #4 Metro. Signs in the Metro pointing to the Museum. We took the free docent tour. Took about 1:20. Lots of information on the tour. There is a huge breath to the museum. We particularly liked the celadon pottery on the 3rd floor as well as the smaller Buddha statues. Several restaurants and a food court.
A worthwhile visit,This museum is a cultural asset of Korea. It shows the sequence of ancient Korea to modern Korea. It is a grand building .Entrance is free but special exhibitions were paid for. Senior citizens get special discount. Wheel chairs are available. Different exhibits are displayed on different floors. Sculptors on one paintings and calligraphy on another.The first floor had historical exhibits. The routes were marked and therefore very easy to follow. The escalators were small and very cute. The souvenir shops had lovely attractive things and we were able to buy things to take home for friends and family The property had lovely gardens with colourful flowers and on going down a few stairs there was a big water body around which people were taking walks and some chilling on benches. I wish I could have spent more time here
Very impressive building,"Went on a solo trip to this place as the wife had another appointment and it was totally worth it.The outdoor areas were beautiful and well designed. The building architecture too was impressive.Going in, you do not need to pay for an entry ticket (however I believe that the special exibhitions are paid events)The first floor narrates the entire history of Korea, starting from the stone age period to the korea empire. Second and third floors belong to art and sculptures. I learnt so much from the artifacts and exibhits on display. I now have a working knowledge of Korean history. The first floor exibhits are structured in a chronological order, so if you follow the recommended route, you will not miss a part of Korean history. Only managed to complete the first level though due to time, but would love a return visit for the other floors if possible. "
"Worth the stop, even just to stroll around outside","I saw very cool pictures of this futuristic place so definitely wanted to go and check it out. The building looks really cool and there was a market right outside it and also down below, very cool vibe and lots of fancy art installations around the museum. We didn't go inside as we are not so interested in museums, but it is definitely worth while just strolling around the place. Totally recommend it!"
A First-Rate Museum of Korean History and Art,"Three friends and I visited the National Museum of Korea after spending about a week studying the Korean War, and we all walked away really glad we spent most of our day here. After covering Korean history from 1949-1953, roughly, we felt like we had a much better understanding of Korean history as a whole, and loved the range and depth that the exhibits here offered. I know the artwork was also worth seeing, but I confess that we were ""museum-ed out"" by the point we hit the art (we spent about 3 hours going through the history exhibits on the first floor alone) that we more or less strolled through, stopping only at the works that really caught our eye. One could easily spend a few hours or a day here and it would be well worth it."
There are better options,"If you don't read Korean and are not familiar with Korean history, this is going to be complicated. I walked through it but it wasn't engaging for me."
Allow plenty of time to enjoy this treasure trove,Unfortunately we were rushed round this stunning museum by our tour guide. It gives a fascinating history of Korea and has many uniquely fascinating exhibits. 
Spend enough time.,You will need one whole day maybe to enjoy this amazing museum. Also visit the museum shop. There are some nice quality things with reasonable prices.
Tremendous ,"On returning to Seoul from a few days in the country we headed here for 2-3 hours before returning the hire car. The place is vast so we didn't do it full justice, but it is stuffed worth Korean treasures from across the agesProfessionally presented, well laid out, there is a follow through route marked on the floor. And it is freeThis is a world class museum "
A somewhat sterile historical museum,"Mostly artifacts. A nice, big space but not too interesting. Would have liked to see more art. Don't expect to spend much time here unless you have a keen interest in Korean artifacts."
Do Not Miss!,"A world-class museum that has free admission and something for everyone. The grounds themselves of this massive building are impressive enough and offer photo ops aplenty. Once inside, I recommend renting an audio guide device at the front desk so that you can get more information on demand about any exhibits or items you find particularly interesting. It's only 1,000 Won.There are usually concerts of some kind happening every Saturday afternoon, which I was lucky enough to catch from the upstairs balcony of the cafe on the second floor just above the stage in the entry atrium.The building itself is a bit of an architectural marvel inside and out as icing on the cake!"
This is one of my top museums in the world!,"Wow! How can we capture our full response to this beautifully designed museum?  Offering a vibrant span of Korean history, plus mesmerizing art and artifacts, we easily could have spent another couple of hours reading the well-written signs and descriptions about the diversity of Korea and beyond. Pretty amazing to see art displayed through antiquity and modernity, with technology offering enlightening new ways to enjoy their stories and masterpieces.The collections were exquisite and the cultural Renaissance happening in Korea is inspiring. How amazing to get to be a witness to the transformation. The visit to the National Museum of Korea informed the rest of our trip around the peninsula."
Decent amount of information and displays,"This is my 3rd time here and I still enjoy it. However, I note that the exhibits hasn't changed much over the years. We didn't understand the English guide much but because he was so sincere, it would have been terrible to fault him. "
important visit,"we went to the museum for a visit. we pre registered for an hour and a half tour. they have yours in several languages. it was excellent. without this you just wonder around and it's too big. it gets you to the right points. so my suggestion us,to do this your and if you want to stay, you can,stay longer. "
A beautiful place to walk around,"The museum was very nice and I enjoyed their collection of potter, and the restaurant inside had a good variety of choices, but I loved this museum for its extensive grounds. We wandered all over the park area and enjoyed the playground, walking trails, pagodas, and lake. I almost didn't want to go inside. We were there in the spring and the cherry trees were in full bloom, but it would be beautiful in any season."
Worth the visit,"We visited during a national holiday so there was not charge. This is a really great museum to visit if you are interested in war history. It has a floor dedicated to all the historical wars that Korea has been a part of, and then a floor for the Korean - American war. This is fascinating, and certainly carries the Korean perspective on the war. Wish we had more time there."
Good exhibit and it is free1,Museum has quite a collection of the emperors' history with beautiful drawings of emperors' parades and how they lived. There is a small gift shop on the premises which one can buy some Korean items at reasonable prices. The antique cars were beautiful 
One of my favourite places to visit,A great place to learn about the Korean history. The English guide was very knowledgeable and I had a great time. The museum restaurant on the ground floor was lovely with great service. 
A MUST. Some Amazing History,"I was truly touched by the heart and soul of the Korean people. The past hundred years of Korea, has been a blind side of history to me. I was given a free book on the History of the Korean War. “Korean War 1129”. Amazing how many countries came to the aid of Korea, what War actually does to a nation, what an oppressive regime can do, and what Freedom does for the soul and a country."
Very interesting ,I enjoyed this museum.The building is huge and modern in a nice surrounding area.There are two main exhibition halls. One with a permanent exhibition about the history of Korea through different artefacts and another one with temporary exhibitions. The main gallery is free admission. If you enjoy history and looking at different artefacts you can spend a few hours there. I went on my own on a Sunday morning and I spent around three hours. There are spaces for you to sit down and rest your legs. There are also some cafeterias and museum shoppings. Throughout the building.I sincerely recommend.
Too big for tired tourists but still very good,"That was our last day in South Korea, and our last day of the long vacation. So, we were a bit exhausted, and the museum building is so big. It’s amazing, the architecture, and the collection."
Great museum,"Since I love history, National Museum of Korea is the best place to visit, they had 3 floors and each floor describe different history. I could spend hours inside. The history also interest me."
Amazing Museum!,"I do love a good museum but this one is particularly impressive. It is incredibly large, very modern, and super organized. All of the signs are in English too so there are no issues with understanding everything."
Excellent!,The building is imposing and the exhibits very well laid out.It is not cluttered and there are themed rooms with very good exhibits.Well worth a visit while you are in Seoul.
A must-visit when in Seoul.,"A fascinating walk throughout Korean history from ancient times to contemporary events across ample, well curated rooms. Everything is explained in both Korean and English. Plenty of rest areas and coffee shops to make it through the long hours it takes to admire the amazing variety of art, objects and information on display. "
"Beautiful, calm, huge!",I spent nearly a whole day at this museum. It is such a beautiful space. I felt calm and meditative within it. LOVED the special exhibition of the tiger in east Asian Art. It is the 9th largest museum in the world and I can't wait to go back and explore it all the more.OH...and the majority of the museum is FREE. You'll have to pay between $3 and $6 for special exhibitions.
National Museum of Korea and Fabulous Park,"Extraordinarily beautiful architectural building with views to Namsan Hill. The park within the Museum is really beautiful, though our visit was in the dead of winter, i could image how beautiful it would be in other seasons - some of the trees have their botanic names. Highly recommmended for a visit, if not just for the park grounds. Comprehensive presentation of Korean history and artifacts, and some in the park also."
Beautiful and comprehensive museum,Extraordinarily beautiful architectural building. Comprehensive presentation of Korean history and artifacts. Plan at least a half a day to fully appreciate
Worth visiting!,"For those who want to understand more on Korean culture, everything is excellent in the National Museum of Korea, including the exhibition, souvenir shop, cafe and the attractive musical performance. I will definitely spend more time visiting the museum when I have a chance to get there again. "
Terrific building with wonderful exhibits,Well organized exhibitions and very spacious and beautifully designed museum . Beautiful grounds surrounding the entire space.
World class facility ,I attended the museum for a free English your which was informative and enjoyable. The museum is world class and seems very new. Taught me alot about Korea and enjoyable visit. 
Large spaces,"The building and setting are spacious. Exhibits are informative, but include reproductions. A pleasant way to spend a couple of hours on a rainy/cold day, especially if you like ceramic pots (there are tons of them!)."
"Big museum, free of charge","National Museum was one of the big museum that we ever visited, and need more than 2 hours to look every exhibition inside it. Just like any other national museums, it had the exhibitions about past time. But they displayed all the artifacts in good arrangement. Besides that, they also had Korean culture exhibition. To reach this museum, just take mrt to Ichon Station and follow the directions. It's free of charge. If you come with kids, we suggest you to also visit Children museum. "
"Beautifully done, but a ton of pottery","I was hoping for more history and less pots. The museum itself is massive and beautiful. I found it hard to get into despite the great job they have done with the artifacts in the museum. I did like the furniture exhibit. The rest I wasn't much impressed by besides the massive pagoda. Maybe I was just too tired to appreciate the museum, but it was worth going at night to see the view of the N Seoul Tower"
Excellent Museum ,This beautiful museum is definitely worth your time. The long history of Korean civilization is beautiful presented and the exhibits have English explanations so no need for a tour. The main museum is free and there is a charge for special exhibits. It’s set in beautiful grounds and near a subway stop. 
Well Worth It!,"Free admission at a first class museum. All the donated collections on the second floor made the visit extra special. The donated collections often contain hundreds of items from a particular collectors area of interest. We were amazed at the generosity of the Korean donors and interested by the unique items that Japanese collectors had actually returned to Korea. Sometimes in museums, when items are arranged by time period and isolated, smaller items seem to lose their beauty. We were impressed that Korean collectors saved so many items from their respective areas of collecting, even though the nation has endured such hardships since its independence. Love the building and grounds. Didn't have time to get to the special exhibitions but this place is worthy of a second day visit. We were happy to see art in Korean everyday items like furniture, money, and even sewing items."
More Korean?,"I was expecting that they would have more Korean things on exhibition (or was I in the wrong museum??). Ground floor was all about the Korea, which is very informative. But the 2nd to 3rd floor, is disappointing. I don't get the connection of the items on exhibit. It's like since the pieces were donated by famous people (I get it..), so they throw all those bits and pieces together? But the interior and exterior architecture made up for the disappointment. The museum is child, elderly and Instagram friendly."
Insightful,An insightful look into the development of Korea over the ages. Admission is free for the main hall. Worth a visit.
Rich in Hystory,"This museum is free. It has around 6 exhibition halls and 50 rooms. Like in every museum that you have been this museum has permanent and special exhihibitions. There is also a separate museum for children. It has English,Japanese, and Chinese tours you need to check how many a day. Subway line 4 will take ypu there. Is really beautiful and has 4 floors that you will enjoy a lot, be sure to have time that day is so many little details in some of the exhibitions. "
Amazing museum. ,"Go! I mean it. All the museums in South Korea were amazing and I went to at least 15 of them. This museum is very well done with English explanations and a free English audio guide (you must leave an ID to borrow the guides so bring your drivers license). While there were no children in my group, I saw lots of groups of children and they had plenty of activities and ways to keep them interested. This museum really helped me to understand the history of Korea and its culture. We spent at least 3 hours in the museum, it just depends on your pace. I would highly recommend going to the National Museum of Korea. "
Impressive but not real exciting,"The museum building is world class, and was the most interesting part about our visit. The museum is very well organized, with a helpful layout that makes it easy to walk from room to room. Lots of different types of Buddhas and history of the country (Japan rule, Buddhism, ancient tools, pottery, weaponry, etc.) As a foreigner in South Korea, I could not fully appreciate the expansive rooms of rock weapons, excavated pottery and the ceramic vase exhibition. There are fire extinguishers everywhere; from one spot I could physically see eleven fire extinguishers. At the restaurant we had a western-style salad and an octopus rice dish; both were very good and reasonably priced."
Great experience the history of Korea and special exhibitions,Permanent exhibitions is Free.Admission is required for special exhibitions.But The special exhibition impressed me!I RECOMMEND it!Please refer to it.I downloaded a 10% discount coupon from Baynaru. :)Good for you!
"Great museum, easy to navigate, excellent exhibition layout in super contemporary well-thought-out building","The museum is huge. You can easily spend 4-5 hours there. It is a new building, very contemporary looking, with a lot of daylight coming in, escalators everywhere, marble floors - simply great. There is a plenty of restrooms, multiple coffee shops, few large museum shops, a storage place to lock your bag or coat. I wanted to get on the English guided tour, which is free, the first one after the museum opening time. I ended up being the only one on the tour. It was only me and a tour guide - call it 'a private tour' :-) The tour took around 1 hour covering a few main artifacts on the first and second floors. I enjoyed it. I also enjoyed perfectly brewed cappuccino in the coffee shop :-)5 stars, highly recommended."
You'll Learn Alot!,I went on a quiet weekday and arrived in time to go on one of the free English guided tour of the museum. It was a great way to get a brief history of Korea and a sense of what the museum had to offer. There's a mix of ancient/old artifacts and art organized by the specific periods in Korea's history. 
Museum,Its free. Very informative of their rich culture. Just in front of the museum is another place for you to visit..
main museum in Korea,There are a lots of heritage and treasure in the museum. easy to go by subway. it is worth to seeing museum. and in the museum shop there are so many unique souvenirs 
Interesting global museum,I thought there would be a Korean emphasis but instead there were many things from other countries so that I did not feel I got a good flavor of Korea
Wonderful and Free,"Because this is a national museum, it is completely free. Free lockers are also nice to stow your coat, bags, etc. Korea is so low on crime I even leave my purse in the locker without worry. Very interesting displays and art. Not a lot in English, as with most museums in Seoul. But this museum is one of my favorite Seoul museums."
Good for Korean history,"The museum is huge, I'm not sure you can see everything in one day. This is great if you are interested in Korean history. I personally wouldn't bring kids here as it can get a bit boring.There is a lot of pottery and the colors are bland, so if you are tired from your travels don't go there, it will put you to sleep, but overall art and history lovers will like it."
Great and rich museum,"This is a big museum with several floors and a large exhibition of artifacts from the different Korean history and dynasties, such as statues, paintings, ceramics, calligraphy, etc.The museum is free and family-friendly, as there were many families and tours with kids when we visited on a Saturday, still it didn't feel crowded."
Cultural experience!,"To get a sense of the Kdrama you have been watching, it's good to get educated on the history. So explore the museum and its surrounding. Beautiful place to get instagrammable photos too!"
Not a fan of museums and still enjoyed it,"Decided to explore it as part of a red bus tour since the entrance was free. Lots of beautiful pieces and it was not crowded, so you can walk around peacefully. I loved the gift shop!"
Beautiful collection!,"A most stunning building with a great collection of artifacts. Free admission, and easily accessible via subway (Icheon stop). Well worth a couple hours to see all the floors."
National museum of Korea,"Very interesting place if you want to learn more about Korean culture, historu and art. Everything is divided into different time decades so you can easier understand the historical periods and heritage. Very calm and meditative place "
Huge and free,This place was our last stop of our Seoul visit. I found it convenient because not only was the entrance free but it was actually worth your time. It's a three storey building with many rooms to enlightened yourself on South Korea's history and culture. Allocate 2 hours of your time because 1 hour isn't enough time to cover the area.
"Huge, Modern, and Free Museum",This is a great place to learn about Korean history and artwork. The museum is very large and modern with all signs in English too. And it's free! We only had about an hour to wander around which isn't nearly enough. Be sure to dedicate some time to this place.
"A cultural, learning treat","This is a wonderful museum, allow 2 days to visit. Beautifully displayed exhibits, and a great coffee place with superb cappuccinos."
"Great Building, But Seems Empty","The best bit is the building itself - as another reviewer wrote ""a museum of space"". It is simply cavernous, and worth a visit in itself. Like most Korean museums it's also free. But where are the contents?The ground floor contains the findings of numerous tomb digs - well-preserved and beautifully presented. My favourite object was a Roman glass jug: think on how that got to Korea 2000 years ago, but sit down first as your mind will begin to spin on what something that fragile had to go through to survive the trip.Upstairs are numerous collections of ceramics: most donated and of really high quality and, again, beautifully displayed.The down side is that, unless ceramics really are a core interest of you this museum doesn't have much to see. Sorry, but it's even a bit dull. I visited several museums during my visit and, I fear, they have spread the jam too thin"
Pleasant experience,"I visited the museum without much expectations as I just wanted to escape the cold but boy, what a find! The museum is very modern looking with a nice square and pond surrounding it. The artifacts and layout is spot on because it was like you are walking the timeline of Korean history, from their prehistoric era to the modern days. Lots of sitting area to rest your leg. Drinking water is even available. Wifi is strong and the cafeteria serves decent enough food."
Great Museum,"Nice museum, you can learn not only Korean history but also other Asian countries history. There are also some lounge for you to take a rest, and the lounge is totally nice. "
Excellent museum,"The National Museum of Korea is an excellent museum. It is the largest museum in Korea. It is housed in an impressive building. Before you get to the main entrance – there are benches and leisure areas. As you enter the main lobby area is large, and spacious. The architecture is something to behold. Outside the museum is a park with a small lake. It is a beautiful setting. The museum has many exhibits that show Korea from historic times to the present day. The museum also holds many cultural activities to further the knowledge of how the museum works, and what it does to acquire items. You can take part in all the activities. There are many books that have been published; and research work to support the preservation of artifacts. On the first floor, is the prehistoric and ancient history gallery; and medieval and early modern history gallery. On the second floor is the calligraphy and painting gallery; donations gallery with exhibits from various collectors. On the third floor is the sculpture and crafts gallery which has Buddhist sculptures, Buncheong ware and white porcelain. There is also the Asia gallery with art from Indonesia, China and Japan. The museum gift shop is full of very nice items to buy.Opening hours are Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday – 10am to 6pmOn Wednesdays and Saturdays – 10am to 9pmOn Sundays and public holidays 10am to 7pm."
Great Archeological of Korea section ,"The museum covers a lot of art and artifacts through the prehistoric era all the way up to the end of Korean Empire with the occupation by the Japanese. The museum is very large, and has a very large small pond. The museum is free, however there are small sections in the museum that charge. Inside the main museum is a restaurant, and outside within the museum grounds has a convenience store, and coffee shop.No shortage of restrooms either. "
Without doubt one of the best museums we have have visited. Excellent layout.,"This museum is free to enter and is first class..... the way in which the exhibits are displayed, clearly described (in English) was excellent. There is very low lighting throughout which may be an issue for anyone with poor vision....The museum itself is a very modern contemporary building that oozes quality.In summary this is a jewel in the crown of museums and one you certainly would not want to miss, first class. Allow at least one hour and possibly more if you want to take it all in......"
Kimchi,"If you want to know more about the local culture this is the place to be; not only you can discover the +40 manners to prepare the famous local vegetable kimchi, but if you are lucky you can attend a local arts performance with local music and many colourful dancers."
To understand the histry of Korea,A must place for those history-lovers. You can understand the history of each dynasty until Korea today. Audio tour is just 1000w and there’s a free guided tour at specific time. Highly recommended for the guided tour which takes 1.5 hours.
Marvelous place to explore Korean history ,"The museum is very modern and provides all needed affiliate such as strollers, lockers, big rest rooms. There are special exhibitions, 50% discount on weekday. "
A nice Korean history lesson learned,It is a good exhibition of the history and development of Korea. very convenient to go by subway and it is free for the permanent exhibits too.
Good exhibits and fantastic building,"Worth a visit if you are into history, they have everything from Neolithic to modern Korea as well as a South East Asia exhibit.It is close to the metro and only a couple of stops from the war memorial as well."
Huge cathedral - worth a stroll,"If you like museums which do forget to put the date, age, year of the object and forget that the historical context of the presented artefact might interest the visitor, you will love the second and third floor. 1st floor: Korean history is a little bit better displayed.We enjoyed the architecture. The building is huge and remembers a cathedral. The food is good in the restaurant. "
Beautiful Grounds and Art,We spent about 3 hours here. The grounds were beautiful and the art was plentiful. It was great to see history from another country through art. Very well laid out.
Free admission and free guided tour,"The National Museum of Korea is one grand building in the Yongsan area. It can be easily accessed by metro to the Yongsan Station. The museum opens everyday except January 1. No admission fee for the main exhibit hall but not for the special exhibition galleries. The building itself is huge and there are 3 levels. We visited the main exhibition hall only. We rented an audio device which gives verbal description of the artifact when to input the number on the show case. It is very helpful as the rooms are always too dark and the description on the plague are too small to read. The 1-hour free guided tour is very helpful too. The lady tour guide spoke perfect English. She showed us the highlights of the museum: the pagoda, huge Buddha painting scroll and some of the royal jewelry. I highly recommend this.There are gift shops on every floor and they sell slightly different things from each other. We had our lunch at the Mirror Pond Restaurant which is outside the main museum. We chose a set lunch of traditional Korean dishes which includes 10 different Korea food: snacks, kimchi, porridge, appetizers, main courses, desserts and tea. It is different and quite enjoyable.If your schedule is not that tight, you can spend a few hours in this museum to find out more about the history of Korea."
"Interesting displays, wonderful gift shop","Renting headphones probably would had been helpful to fully appreciate all the information to be learned at this museum It was modern and well laid out and even though it was crowded, it was not hard to get around. The Gift Shop had the best quality items for souvenirs and gifts."
"Stunning architecture, amazing history","I'd definitely put this at the top of things to do in Seoul. Go here before (or instead of) the palaces. Excellent layout to the exhibitions, and done in a way that one learns a lot about Korean history. Does a good job of incorporating all aspects of life, from food to religion to political systems to agriculture, etc."
Great exhibition for history lovers,"The place is easy to reach, huge and has beautiful surroundings and building structures. Entrance is free. The inside of the museum is spacious, clean and it has chairs and lounges for those who need rest after walking around the museum. It is separated into different sections for different period or era or timeline, which was interesting and systematic of them. Recommend to download the apps as it will guide you on your trip to the history of Korea."
Great exhibits on Korean history,Learned a lot while browsing the exhibits. Definitely don't miss this if you're a fan of history and art.
Great exhibits,The National Museum is definitely worthwhile visiting since it covers many different aspects of Korean history. Artefacts from other Asian countries which influenced Korea are on display and it covers a few thousand years of history. Àll is arranged according to different topics and timeline and it is very easy to find your way around. Several cafes invite for breaks. Multimedia equipment is available in several languages. Admission is free.Good to combine with the War Museum around the corner.
Amazing Museum Located Right in Seoul,"This museum in absolutely huge! The best thing is that it is 100% free!The building is a giant granite stone structure and located on the right side is the Korean history side. From here you can see many things from pre-history to modern times. The best highlight for me was the huge gold crown that the emperor wore and the 10 story pagoda! There are three floors, the first floor as artifacts while the others are dedicated to statues and paintings!On the left side of the museum is the special exhibition hall where they normally have special exhibits in. You can check what is there on the official website and there is an extra charge for these exhibits. I recommend dedicating a few hours and make sure to wear some comfortable shoes when visiting!They also have an application that you should download to your phone which is like a personal GPS audio guide for your trip!For more on the national Museum of Korea and other places in Seoul I have a like to my travel blog of Seoul in my profile."
Spectacular setting,"A visit to this museum is worth it just to take in the setting and the unique architecture of the building. While the art collection is probably not as stunning as many would like, and it is mostly related to Korean history, the museum is easy to navigate and impressive in its design. We had lunch in the restaurant overlooking the grounds. The food was Korean fare, good, but not great; nonetheless, we enjoyed sitting beside the floor to ceiling windows and taking in the view."
A grand museum!,"You'll need a couple of days to fully explore all of the items housed here, especially if you're into reading all of the information like I am. This is my favorite museum in Korea."
Worth a few hours,"Give this place a look if you have time. A decent look at the history of the Korean peninsula. Special exhibits cost money, but to get in, it doesn't cost anything."
One of the Best Museums I've Ever Been To,Stunning collection of Korean artifacts and artwork. Museum is well-organized and exhibits are varied. Great gift shop and dining options aswell
A big national museum.,The museum welcoming us by providing a large open space. This is a big museum with many exhibitions and collections so I suggest you prepare to spend your time here minimum half a day.
Good understanding of Koreans' History ,Went there with friends after few days of meeting. Able to learn and understand the Koreans history without admission fess. Easy to access through subway and very well maintained and offered multi languages sign board. Recommended for those intend to know Korea better.
Mostly Old artifacts in a Modern building ,"Strong sea legs are required. A lot of walking involved. Close to the train station. If you like art and history, this place is great for you. A lot of excavated Korean artifacts. Probably one of the biggest Museums in Asia. Cafes and restaurants inside and around the museum. Entrance is free for the permanent exhibit. There might be a fee for their special exhibits. Check their website for more information. "
Very interesting- attend the free tour!,"We went to the free tour that is held in English and in my opinion, this is the only way to visit the museum which would have otherwise been very overwhelming because it is so big. The tour guide was GREAT and broke down the most important items in the museum. He gave us tons of information- it was SO interesting! I also love that the museum is free. "
Absolutely worth it,"Basically I don't like museum, but i think this place is absolutely worth it to visit. I believe you will find something interesting inside. Besides, it's free of chargeI planned to visit the museum for just one hour but end up into 4 hrs."
See the history and unique contribution from individuals,"This place is a must visit for history lovers, to see the stody of Seoul and Korea. With modern architecture and adequate space, the museum is fantastic. "
Wonderful building and superb collections,This is a beautiful building in a superb setting and so much to see - I spent 2 hours in just 3 of the ceramics halls.
National museum of Korea,You can see Korean ancient history in various aspects here. The architectural building is surrounded by a spacious comfortable garden. It is conveniently connected with subway. 
Can't Miss this (Oct 2015),"A large museum with many interesting displays, and you can spend an hour or a day here. Some displays have been fixed-up and really gave a taste of the old Korean culture. Besides the size of the building itself, it was a bit of a walk from the Ichon metro station as well, so wear your most comfortable shoes for this one."
It's BiiiG,A very big museum with more collections. I visited two of them and was pleased with the display. The permanent collection is on Korean history and shows the countries history from different aspects.The place is easily accessible with the subway.
"Magnificent, best 6 hours spent","What a superb museum! We were very impressed by the sheer size of it, the magnificent architectural design of the building, the incredible gardens, but about every all, the exhibits. It was an amazing experience for us and a fantastic opportunity to see all the exhibits, the art collections, the artifacts representative of past eras in Korea. We are very impressed with the job the curator did with all the exhibits. At no time did we ever encounter large crowds or other distraction. We were able to fully enjoy our visit and the ease with which we could study each exhibit quietly and uninterruptedly. The collections are superb, the excellent preservation condition they are in and the helpful information available to the public to help us learn about Korea's past.I strongly recommend a visit to this museum. It's absolutely magnificent! We also had lunch there after we were done and were equally impressed with the restaurant. Excellent food!"
Very good museum and free admission,"Very good museum that contains a wealth of artifacts and information on the history of Korea from the Neolithic period through the various kingdoms and Dynasties. Also exhibits on Korean calligraphy, paintings, and some exhibits from other areas of Asia. Did I mention the admission is free? Easy access on Subway Line 4. at Ichon Station"
Good solo trip,"If you're alone and nothing to do, this is the thing for you to do. There's a few sections in this museum, but I'd say the hanguel museum is the best, interactive and very informative. It's free! It's accessible by metro! Just right outside the station. Forgot which one, sorry!"
Great experience,"At the time of writing, the ticket price was 6000 won - certainly acceptable considering the wealth of Korean history on display. There are a lot of ceramic pieces to view, great Buddha statues, and artifacts from other countries such as china and India. The museum is laid out so that there is no crowding around certain exhibits. It is quiet, clean, beautiful, and has food and drink on offer in the cafe.Here is the caveat to the five star rating. If you are a family with younger members and are planning to go, then unless your kids are smart and attentive, they WILL be bored at this museum. All of the children present during my visit were running around paying no attention to the exhibits, and there is nothin child friendly in the main part of the museum. Choose wisely."
Korean history!,I like this museum because of its size and number of exhibitions. It is massive and a good place to visit together with War memorial museum. They are near by and easily accessible by public transportation in Yongsan area. 
Informative,Informative and very interesting to learn more about Korea in this museum. Best part about this is that it's free and open to all!
Passionate volunteer guide,"The museum provides daily guided tours, free of charge, in various languages (check out their website for schedule). Our guide was a middle aged man volunteering for the museum. Thanks to his passion and vivid personality he brought life to the tour, as well as the artefacts. And I would not see the hours fly by. "
Must see,"We spent an day at this excellent museum and could have enjoyed another day there but did not have the time. Don't miss this one and plan on plenty of time. If I recall correctly, it was free."
The place to visit in Seoul !,Whatever the length of your stay in Seoul but the museum is THE place to visit.... And it's free :-))
great museum,"Not only the museum building is magnificent, the exhibits were wonderful too. There were two signature exhibition on Arabian and French fashion when I was there - I enjoyed it alotThe food court in the museum served good standard food, and I loved the museum shop.A must go for all travellers who are in Seoul, Korea"
"seun ò Korea is very nice,","the capitl is very nice, nature, and the human is friendly. trafic is very good, clearn , and trafic is easygo from seun to all the district is very easy. very cheap . "
World Class,"The grand, marble lined, modernist building channels plenty of natural light to show off Korea's ancient treasures. It harmoniously blends traditional and contemporary styles. It is the largest museum in Korea and houses precious Korean cultural assets that tells the story of Korea's history, from ancient to The modern times. The museum is divided into two exhibition areas for the purpose of displaying relics and artifacts. Permanent exhibition includes prehistory and ancient history, medieval and early modern history, calligraphy and arts, sculpture and arts. No entrance fee to see the permanent exhibitions, but a paid ticket is required to see any special exhibits. Take Subway Line 4 to Ichon Station Exit. 2."
Lots to see,"This place is massive and the exhibits are excellent. However, it does take a long time to see everything, so it might be a good idea to take a break or two. There is a coffee shop, as well as many resting spots with chairs. As entrance is free, one may even split a visit over a few days. Would highly recommend for a first time visit to Seoul or Korea, but for someone who has seen other museums in Korea, much of it might seem like more of the same. "
Outstanding Museum,"Timed my visit so I could take the tour, which I would heartily recommend. The English tour began at 2 pm and Hyun provided a ""greatest hits"" version of the museum for the next 1.5 hours. Not only did I learn about Korean history, but I left with insight into Buddhas, pagodas, and traditional pottery. Heartily recommended."
A must-visit in Seoul,"The main hall was absolutely amazing and well organized to give visitor, especially the foreign one as me, a holistic view of Korean history, arts, literature. The exhibitions led me back to thousands years ago and then gradually entering the modern history of Korea. On 3rd floor, there was a great exhibition of Asian arts which was worth to visit too. And the best thing? It was totally free :)"
Interesting Place to pay a visit,"While in Seoul it is considered one of the places you should pay a visit to. Interesting architecture, nice floor plan a bit limited exhibits collection, but overall nice place."
Modern Museum,The museum is very modern and easy to get to. I would say the exhibits that were available weren't as good as the ones back in Canada.
Understanding Korea,"Had an enjoyable afternoon. Lots to see over many subjects. Great history explained well. Hours vary, so check first. "
Must see!,The Museum is well organized and the place to go if you want to learn about Korean history and culture. Going through the exhibit you move in time from pre-historic to the early 20th century. On the way you will admire the beautiful golden treasures of the Shilla dynasty;
Must place to visit in Seoul,What a fantastic lace to visit - free admission is a bonus.Good way to learn about the korean history and culture. Precious artifact presented in a very simple and effective way with good english translation.The building is modern and has a nice view of the city from it's perimeter.
Very Korean and asian stuff,If you want to see traditional Korean stuff than go to this museum above everything. You will know history of Korea peninsula.
Beautiful ,Very beautiful and interesting museum. You can learn so much and the staff there is more than willing to help. A must see if visiting Korea. 
Fabulous display in superb spaces,"Spend as much time as you can here ..it's a brilliantly designed complex with innumerable wonderful artefacts to see.Warning ..do not waste won on the audio guide . The 3000 won version sounded as if the translation into English was done and read by a robot, and the vcommentary added little to the free information given at the piece . Only a tiny fraction of what is on display is covered . I returned it after two hours, though I spent the whiole day there."
Should be called Museum of Korean Artifacts,"This is a beautiful, massive museum and is incredibly well done. However, we were a bit disappointed because it was basically full of artifacts from Korean and Eastern history. My kids kept calling it the ""pot"" museum. I should have done more research on the museum because we were hoping for more of an all-around history/culture/artifact museum. For such a big museum, a lot of the items seemed repetitive. If you like historical artifacts this is the place for you! We also spent about an hour at the Children's museum area which was nice. It is meant for younger children (probably 8 years or younger.)"
Huge,It is the one of the biggest museum in the world. There are various historical art facts of Korea and some other arts of Asia. You can put your belongings in a locker for 100 won. Prepare a coin. 
Amazing history ,"This museum consolidates so much of the Korean history in one place and has some amazing artifacts. The halls are broken up by time period or dynasty and walk you through what occurred in this nation. There are 3 floors of different presentations showing the culture and resilience of the people. The Egyptian tour was happening at the same time, but the free Korean section was better."
Underrated! great for couples!,The museum is what you would expect but the underrated part is their lovely park that surrounds the museum. There is even a small man-made waterfall and lake.Took my wife on our first date here and she loved it.
MASSIVE!,"It took me about a whole day just to fully explore the right wing of the first floor. The museum shows incredibly old archaeological finds. By the time I was done, I was easily able to identify artifacts which was fun. If you are in Korea (or in any country for that matter) for a short time, go to the museum because you will learn so much so fast."
Huge,You could easily spend several days here and still not see everything. Don't pass this gem up. And it is free.
History unfolding right before your eyes,"The place is spotless clean . It would open your eyes on what korea was before. Must see, it is free of charge"
Better be at the War Museum rather than this,Very boring. Nothing interesting. Just artifacts that describes nothing. War Museum was way more interesting and you learn way more from that museum.
Wonderful museum,"Admission free. Also English tour free.The tour was very informative and covered all the highlights. The guide helped us choose other areas to see on our own. The museum itself was world class, beautiful and air conditioned."
Huge ,"This a huge museum, separated into two annexes so that two different exhibits can be curated at the same time. There is also a 'Children Museum' i guess for the young ones. And there are a few gardens too.Easily reached from Ichon train station. It is almost opposite the National Hangeul Museum. Admission fees applies."
"Breathtaking, majestic!","The National Museum of Korea is one of the best museums I have ever visited. They have a great collection of Buddha statutes, and they are huge and fascinating. The museum has different exhibition halls which exhibits according to different dynasties. Definitely a must-go if you love culture and are visiting Korea! "
World-class museum--not to be missed,"If you visit one thing in Seoul, make it the Gyeongbokgung Palace. If you visit a second thing, make it this museum. The National Museum of Korea is huge, but very well laid out. A typical route takes you on a trip through Korean history from neolithic to 20th Century. Then there are additional galleries for different areas (China, Japan, etc.) and types of objects (porcelain, bronzes, etc.).The museum is free, but they often have excellent special exhbits for which there is a charge (typically KRW 5,000-6,000). The museum is set in a beautifully landscaped park, which makes a nice walk if you arrive 45 minutes or so before the opening time. The museum is easily reached from a dedicated passageway from the Ichon station on Line #4; but the passage opens at 8:00, so don't count on it before that! Otherwise, it is a short walk above-ground. "
Amazing Museum and grounds,"This museum is amazing! I love it as a Geeky history lover and my son loves it for the interactive children's museum and the cool armor and weapons. On a nice day, make sure you go and check out the beautiful grounds and the adjacent Yongsan Family Park. "
Great Museum,Best way to view the history and traditional culture of Korea. The museum is huge and the architecture is magnificent. Admission is free. Subway station is Ichon on the number 4 line.
Modern art gallery ,"Honestly, I wasn't surprise to find an amazing amount of Artists performed at the Museum. South Korea, one of the best leader on the Art scene today. So, we found Contemporary sound installations, reconfigured and cosmology art, so trendy for present days. Thumbs up! "
Monumental Museum,The sheer size alone makes this attraction a must-see. On the inside visitors will be swept away by the highlights of cultural achievements of the past half millennium.
An Educational visit if you want to know about Korea.,"The architecture of the museum is spectacular. Its like going to a really top class , 5 star Hotel than a museum. They have a really worthy collection of Korean history and other areas. But before coming to this museum i would also recommend the Palace museum and also the King Sejong museum under the King sejong stature. They cover the parts of history which is important for Korean drama fans . this national museum adds to the experience. i only visited the korean section but not the other floors. I think about 2 hours will cover the korean section adequately. There are lots of seats on each floor if you have parents who don't want wander around. "
Feng sui museum ,"We were in town visiting brother who works at Hangyan teaching music. He highly recommended this museum for the architectural features as well as the art and historical items. We were surprised at the majesty of the space we were moving through. It appeared the building was thoughtfully built to house the art so that you are able to take in the art without developing Stendhal syndrome., or feeling that you have seen too much. Highly recommend making this a must see on your next tour to Seoul."
Awesome! ,We came in the morning. The museum is huge! We saw Korea's historical development through the years from medieval to modern art. The three Kingdoms history of artifacts and relics were displayed. 
"It's big, beautiful and free","Great museum to visit and get a feel for Korean history. Lots of nice objects to see including beautiful Boeddha and Bodhisattva statues. The two big pieces in the central hall are also worth a look. Finally the also have a small southeast asian collection. Wouldn't call it a must see, but definately worth a visit."
Worth a vist,"Looks can be deceptive, there is LOTS to see, you could spend hours here but our guide took us round the main highlights which was great."
Take your time to look,"Inside outside, the National museum is fill with artifacts. There is even an alley with little Shop houses they used to have in the past. It is now a props like area for photo opportunities. "
Miss B,Fabulous building situated in beautiful gardens which overlook a lake. Well worth a visit. The art is spread over 3 floors surrounding huge internal foyer. This means it's not too overwhelming and you can see a lot in a short space of time. It's also free! 
"Grand, free of charge and got nice Asian art","Main exhibition hall is free of charge, temporal exhibitions are not free. Building itself is very modern and got nice pond in front of it. It's accessible by subway (Line 4 or the Jungang Line (Munsan-Yongmun) to Ichon Station. Go out Exit 2, and walk 150m toward Yongsan Family Park (info from their site). You can get a pamphlet with map and explanation for each hall. There are 3 floors. First one is dedicated to archeology and history of South Korea, second to calligraphy and third to Asian art. They also got nice shop on the first floor and cafe on third. So i recommend to visit."
Outstanding museum worth a trip to Seoul,"This is a museum that impressed me by far in Seoul. On three floors and logically divided, everything on display is beautifully arranged. Once you are in the museum, you are immersed in the history of Korea and Asia while it doesn't let you go. You are so immersed in a visual experience, that you loose track of time. Entrance is free of charge and that surprised me, since the interior and everything on display is really outstanding and well organized. Awesome!!!"
Could have spent an entire day here,"I did not expect to enjoy a museum so much. There is an immense amount to see, as well as rooms that teach you about their scientific preservation process which was extremely interesting and which I found to be different to the typical museum because it elevates and informs the audience's perception (or lack thereof) of all the hard work that goes on behind the scenes that is invisible to the typical museum goer's eye. What I thought would be a quick stroll through became a three hour trip which was in itself still rushed so I could have gladly spent half or an entire day there. Best of all, entrance was free, which is amazing considering this is an extremely well designed and organised museum. At the lower section there is also a lovely souvenir shop to go through."
💋 The Architecture itself is something to visit. Interestig guide Tour. They need new ideas to diplay pieces.,"If I do not know a City I start from the Museum. I had only one morning free and it was really beautiful to be in this building and appreciate the Architecture outside and inside.Not having knoledge of this culture I joined a tour and was a good experience, not too long, topic pieces. Is true which the number of pieces it is not huge, but it is a way to indulge and digest better what is in display. Comeing from Italy I know to be spoild, in our museum we host tons of incredible pieces of Art. Here in Asia I found a different concept of border between Art and Handicraft. Anyway in my mind now I have some more puzzle pieces, to picture differeces in Asian cultures.In this Museum the big lack, in my point of view is in the display concept, too traditional. I aspected more interactive ideas or tecnological way to show working process. An use of technology to display Budda in his original location or give information. The Museum was full of student playing wit them mobile phone. The same device could be interact with pieces in display, telling the stories of each piece and make interaction between students."
not really interesting with pottery and history artifacts.,"I'm not an artist, so to see pottery and paintings is just my stereotype of a boring museum and this fit my stereotype exactly."
Meh,"This is a grandiose and well organized museum. My problem is that there are not so many artifacts worth seeing. Perhaps my appreciation of historical Eastern paintings, pottery and calligraphy is not groomed enough, but I did not find many things in the collection compelling. I appreciated the building more, and that this museum is free."
Deep in Culture ,"For first time tourists, this is a must see. Artifacts and history lesson in a building that is amazing itself. Nice walk outside as well. "
Interesting Museum for Asian culture and art!,This museum was very nice. Lots of beautiful artwork. Takes a while to go though and see all exhibits. My husband and I enjoyed the free museum. We did not go to the special exhibits so I cannot comment on those. But there is plenty of interesting art and cultural pieces to see in the free museum and it will take you a good part of the day. Plenty of bathrooms and plenty of places to get some quick food or drink. There is a very pretty park outside. 
One of the best museums in Asia,"The architecture of the Museum is wonderful, outside and inside the building everything has been rightly, carefully and beautifully designed. Concerning the design and presentation of the exhibitions is excellent: very clear presented, easy to understand all the rooms and artifacts. The quality of the pieces is extremely good, magnificent and very beautiful. A must in Seoul that you cannot miss. Besides the entrance is free."
Wonderful!,I like its architecture and harmonious space with field and lake under open sky. I had a chance to enjoy free orchestral music on Saturday. It was great.
A true high spot,The exterior design complemented the amazing interior with stunning galleries. Obtain a leaflet ask reception for key icons to visit. A lovely pagoda sits along side the lake. Great views. 
Beautiful Museum with Lovely Park,The architecture was stunning...and I am from NYC so I know from museums.Staff helpful.So much Korean history that you really need two days to do it justice.Enjoyed sitting in the surrounding park.
Very interesting,"It's hard to believe that you're still living history when you walk through this place. It's set up to look like history but it's current events. Some of the displays saddened me, some just seemed like much propaganda. "
Very high standard ,You can see from the second you walk into the huge atrium that this is going to be a world class museum. The information is presented tastefully and clearly and there is a great deal to see. Completely free too! Seoul is a lovely city!
Not to be missed,"The museum is located in the middle of a beautiful park. If it was just for the architecture the visit would already be worth wile. Is a huge three floors building in which is located a very tall and ancient pagoda. They offer very good english spoken tours. If you can, you should take it. That museum show how proud Koreans must be of their country."
Made a quick visit,Some of my traveling companions took two days to see the museum. I did a quick walkthrough and it was impressive.
History of Korea and beyond,Huge modern well laid out building. Wheel chair friendly with lifts. Many displays have an English translation. Maps and other information available in several languages besides English or Korean. Easily accessible from Seoul metro getting off at Ichon station. Well worth a visit to learn about the history of Korea and beyond. Also worth visiting the Hangeul museum next door.
Very big museum,A nice museum where you can see and learn about the history and culture in the earlier days. Do check out the special exhibition that they have if you are lucky enough to visit. Managed to see the mummy exhibition while visiting and it was definitely interesting to see up close. 
Fine exhibition on ancient history,"We expected to find information on the modern time, but we only found two floors with ancient history. The building is beautiful and the garden a nice place to relax."
Magnificent Museum,"If you have an interest in Korean history and culture as expressed through pottery, and metalwork you will find this museum to be quite satisfying. The many statues of Buddhas from Korea and other countries are awe inspiring and quite beautiful. "
A must see museum in Korea,I love going to museums. i learned alot of korean culture while I was here in the National Museum of Korea :) I suggest you go here weekdays as there are few people during weekdays; expect many tourist and locals during weekends :)
Beautiful and excellently thought out museum for all ages,"A fantastic museum set in a really beautiful, huge building on grounds with a lot of green and a big reflecting pool. The museum is free and great for all ages. The first floor spans the history of Korea – from around 2000 BCE up to the present day. The upper floors have more concentrated collections, or individual collections of donors. There are excellent descriptions for the art and some really thoughtful and interesting layouts (sometimes showing how pieces were found or excavated, or laying out in drawing or simple metal work what the rest of a boat or statue would look like if still complete). We easily spent three hours and we didn’t even make it to the top floor. I was also really impressed by the interactive elements they had for visitors who were visually impaired with replicas of some of the major works to be felt with accompanying braille descriptions. I also saw a lot of children on field trips, and it looks like the museum had created interactive guides for kids. The museum is right off of the Inchon Station"
Not all Korean history ,Really great venue and easy to access. There is an app to help you around the museum which you should download before you visit but free wifi at the venue helps. Would return. 
Stunning building with Free admission,"It was wonderful that it was directly off the metro stop so it made it easy to find and get to. The building itself is lovely, and the admission is free. I learned a lot about Korean history in this very cool peaceful setting. "
Showing a glorious past,"I visited this museum on my fourth travel to Korea, and I'm still thinking it's a mistake. For better understanding of Korean culture it must be visited immediately after your arrival.Entrance is free. Very friendly to English speakers. Amazing and huge building with a nice design and breathtaking views from the city. "
Amazing ,This is one huge and well laid out museum. I enjoyed exploring each exhibit and taking pictures of precious items that are important to the people of South Korea. Admission is free to explore this massive museum. There were many students there today on a field trip which made it more exciting to see children learning history. Worth the trip to come and see. 
One of the best museums ,"The museum is fairly new and huge. Visiting here will help you to understand history and culture of Korea. Make sure to stop by the museum shop at the end, it's the best place to buy pretty souvenirs, that you can't find outside of the museum, good quality and super cute, at reasonable prices. "
Amazing Place to Visit,"The building is marble lined with alot of natural light which they utilize in a unique way. The building is huge but the must-see are Baekje Burner, the Treasures from the Tomb of Hwangham. The ten story pagoda carved from marble is absolutely stunning! They do offer guided tours in english every hour (highly recomend)."
Way too big for what's there,"Scale if the building doesn't reflect the quantity of exhibits inside. Very thinly spread objects in a massive cavern of a place, they could have shown everything in a building a fraction of the size."
A great place to visit in Korea ,"The national museum of Korea it's a must if you came to Korea. In just a couple hours the museum shows the history of the country, and also it's a really nice view. The museum has everything translated (wich is nice if you don't speak korean) easy access and a nice area."
Worth to visit,Easy access through metro station via Metro #4.No entrance fee.Good to understand Korean history from pre-historic to 19th century.
Beautiful and peaceful place,I went there for craftwork classes and that palce is amazing. It brings the old and the new in its architeture. Everything there makes it worth it.
My trip to Seoul.,Go here. You can spend a few days in this four story place. It is a stop the subway.There are discounted prices. There are also rentals to hear about the exhibits along the way. I forgot the price. I am interested in the Joseon period so I spent most of my time on the first floor. I also went to the fourth floor to the nice café and had cookies and coffee. There is a childrens museum next to this museum. It is centrally located and very easy to find. There are cafe's outside and also places to eat and sit. A must see.
Excellent museum with interesting artifacts,Plan on spending at least 2-3 hours in this extremely clean and modern museum. Lots to see. Loved th 10 story pagoda.
Fascinating History,"This is a great place to discover the long and fascinating history of Korea. It's organized well so you can wander through rooms that represent the various periods and dynasties. Contributions of each era are highlighted and explained in English as well as Korean. There are a couple of gift shops where you can buy items that exemplify the artistic work of different times. The main part of the museum is free, but there is a charge to get in to the special exhibition area."
Great museum ,Best English translations we have seen in Korea for a museum. Better than Hong Kong's translations. First floor is all Korean history we skipped the upper floors which appear to be artifacts and paintings. Lunch at their restaurant was the best museum food we have ever had. Highly recommended. 
A very facinating place to visit,"This museum is one of the best that I have ever visited, extremely large with a huge range of exhibits, there is free wifi available plus food and drink outlets."
A journey into Korean history.,Well we took a tour to see Seoul's major attractions and this is one of them. Lot of displays about Korean culture their history and practices of the past. It was fun.
Great way to spend some time,3 stories of amazing things to see! They took some time in designing a beautiful functional building. The layout is easy to follow and there are maps in many languages. 
Amazing building and grounds,"This is one of the most spectacular museums that I have seen. The grounds are flawless, the museum is interesting and sparklingly clean. Great restaurants inside. Permanent collections are fascinating. Well worth a visit."
Exquisite exhibitions,"Prior to arriving in Korea, I intended to visit the national museum. First, I should mention that transportation in Seoul is superb. It is quite easy to navigate the city and find out how to get to your destination. According to a famous travel book, I learned that this new museum may look deceiving from the outside by its StarTrak spaceship aura. Don't be alarmed, once you stepped inside, you're in a different world. There're two buildings: one the left is for special exhibition; one on the right is for permanent exhibits which is free to public. It is clear how hard-working and dedicated the museum curators have been to their national treasures. I went to the top floor first and slowly made my way down. The highlight on the first was a special room for the golden crown from Silla period. I would say that such experience alone is worth the visit. The artifacts presented in organized categories with well-labled translation in English. The spacing and the lighting of each object in its special glass cases were quite pleasing to the eyes. I spent about 3 hours total; wandering 4 floors of this incredible museum. The facility is spotless clean. There's a tearoom/cafe on the top floor; next to a sitting room. Security staff are attentive and courteous. Word of advice: definitely wear your most comfortable shoes."
Good place,Guide gave us nice explanation. Well organized museum. Very well expressed historical facts. Wish I had more time and enjoy more detail. But overall museum is not extremely big. 
very huge and so many collections to see here,"its was worth of visit this place. its took me 2 hours and 30min to see everything from ground floor to 3rd floor..if you are really interested in history and collections, this is the best place you must visit.."
"very beautiful, rich collection, many errors in English","This is a must-see in Seoul to understand Korean's rich artistic history. The guided tour was wonderful. Sadly, many labels and information in English, are poorly spelled, or translated! Unworthy of a fine museum."
Architectural and cultural delight in Seoul,"Among my favorite museums in Seoul. I regularly go there with family, friends or even just by myself. What ever your mood or the weather a fantastic museum to go to year round."
Impressive collection,"An impressive building and an impressive collection of Korean artefacts and details of Korean history. Laid out over three floors there was also an eclectic collections of items donated by local artists. The museum also has special exhibitions from time to time, but unfortunately we did not have time to see the current one on Egypt. Easily found with the Seoul City tour bus stopping outside the main entrance. Lots to see and could easily spend a full day if you took your time looking at all the exhibits. Would be good for a rainy day and it's free entry, with a helpful leaflet in most major languages should you be limited for time and want to see the main exhibits. "
Beautiful museum!,"I went to this museum during a city tour. The grounds are beautiful. You will see some interesting things...the girls in their ceremonial Korean gowns are very happy to let you snap their picture. As for the museum, it is a very good overview of South Korea. "
Educational and Majestic,"I spent the better part of a day at the museum. I learned so much about Korean pre-history and history. The exhibits were comprehensive and offered just the right amount of information. I was surprised by the lack of information about Japanese invasions and occupation and the Korean War. Those might be at another museum, maybe at the War Memorial of Korea? I did not get to visit that one. The museum is beautiful, spacious, and light-filled, even on an overcast day. There were plenty of places to sit and rest. The subway station had people-movers to the station exit so that you can save your legs for walking all over the museum. The food court near the entrance offered a variety of entrees that were well-prepared and reasonably priced. The outdoor plaza was a little barren, but we went in November, so that is not too surprising. It is probably lovely in the spring and fall."
Amazing Museum!,This museum is a must to learn about Korean culture and history. The gift shops offers interesting items at a reasonable price. The restaurant outside of the museum entrance has good food much cheaper than inside the museum. We returned to this museum in our limited time in Seoul because it was THAT GOOD!
"Excellent place, very unique",The design of the museum into a pagoda is very unique and empathetic of the surrounding heritage palace. The museum itself is full of knowledge worthy of discovery. I would recommend spending at least 2-3 hours here to explore the place.
Very nice ,"There is a museum and also real old street with old style korean shops, its with same place another palace. Check to close days before go"
They are Improving!,"NMOK use to be on a standstill a couple years back, there wasn't much action going on and exhibitions were quite bland. It has become much more lively recently and I am impressed by how much the exhibits have become lively and improved in content. Now I feel like it is appropriate to say that art enthusiasts should definitely consider stopping by this great establishment."
Best place to know history of korean,"If you really want to know about korean, this is the best place for you to visit. If you want to know how south korean and north korean split, come and visit this place. You will never get boring."
A World Class Museum...And It's FREE!,I went here expecting to have to pay some admission fee. Low and behold the museum was free even to foreigners. The museum is massive and if you really wanted to you could spend half a day there. I spent about two and a half hours there and was able to see most of the major exhibits. You get a very thorough overview of Korea's older history. 
"Massive museum, don't forget to walk around outside","This very modern and massive building is impressive on its own. The historical artifacts are abundant and well displayed, but the old- fashioned, hands-off approach is typical of most museums in the world (therefore, the kids lose interest quickly). There are lots of details (English and Korean) for history buffs, lots of art to explore, pottery, furniture, and more. The museum is free, there are reasonably priced restaurants and coffee shops to rest your feet in, there's also a reasonably priced and large store to get some tasteful souvenirs at. They have a special exhibit hall which we missed, so I can't comment on it - Egypt in Feb and March 2017. You need a least 2 hours to get through it quickly, but 4 hours would be better if you want to read details.If the weather is nice, don't forget to go outside and walk around the grounds. There are pagodas, sculptures, water features, a giant bell, and some nice paths to stroll on. Keep walking east and you'll find a large playground/park.It's all worth the visit."
A must for the serious traveler ,This is one of my favorite Museum in the world. And if you love Asian History it is a must! This is the most amazing collection of ceramics ever ! Be prepared to spend at least 3 hours or plan on coming back. Even with that amount of time I didn't see everything... Take time to contemplate the Buddha.
Mostly about Korea's Wars,"As many know, Korea has many large companies such as Samsung, Huyndai etc.. This museum exhibits a lot of altered stories. Basically, it is just another place like the Korean palaces or tower. "
Lovely museum.,We really enjoyed our visit at this museum. We were thrilled that they had an Egyptian display as a special exhibition. Really well laid our and easy to access every floor.
Huge Museum ,Well this is the type of place that a museum addict love. This museum is huge (6 floor FYI). With around 15.000 collections. Maybe I need to come more than twice to get to know every collection in here. This museum open from 9 am to 9 pm and free admission for permanent exhibition. 
Okay museum,"Good for overview of Korean history, but difficult to follow as the story was not well told (i.e. did not flow well) and there were limited English descriptions."
Good place for Koreans,"I am getting a bit museumed out. The ground floor was the best for me as it started back in the stone-age where I haven't seen that in any of the other museums, Some of the other floors had lines of pots that were very similar, or open books which if you can't read Korean are just lost in translation. If you are in Seoul for a few days then chose one of the museums, but unless you are into all the Korean history then you will soon be over it. I noticed that on the 2nd and 3rd floors even the locals were walking down the middle. There are two cafes here so you can rest your feet."
Well worth visiting,"Entrance is free, although you may need to pay to see the special exhibitions (usually from overseas). Kids museum too. Massive modern space, laid out over three floors, well presented and interesting exhibits. A bit like Ikea in that you follow a tortuous route, but keep your eyes peeled as there are some stunning artifacts tucked away just off the main path. "
Free but well worth a fee!,Very informative museum with great displays of Korean wars from the past. It's free--who can ask for more than that?! Three floors x2. Most everything in English as well as Korean.
An amazing walk through Korean history,"This is a very well presented look at Korean history from early days to present. It is a beautiful space with amazing artifacts, and there is also a children's component (the kid's part requires a timed entrance ticket, so grab one when you arrive if interested). We spent a day here and walked through the whole of the exhibits, and our children (7, 9, and 11) stayed engaged for the most part. The grounds are beautiful as well. Overall, a great overview of the history of Korea, and a recommended visit for anyone living here or visiting this fascinating country."
Everyone should visit the National Museum of Korea,You will need a whole day to look at everything on the 3 floors of this museum. We went for a couple of hours in the morning and there were lots of korean students visiting. The building is very impressive inside and out. The museum has an excellent collection that portrays many years of korean history. Good for both koreans and foreigners. There's a cafe inside the museum where you could rest your legs. We took a taxi into the parking lot where there is a drop off point but on our way out we had to walk a little bit to get to the streets to grab a taxi. Well worth the visit.
A good way to spend the day!,"Along with the Korean War Memorial, it was a really nice way to spend the day just by walking around!"
Traditional Musuem,"This museum has some amazing exhibits and is worth a visit, but limited English descriptions and repetitive nature of the exhibits means you don't need to spend a lot of time here. Was good at exhibiting but not so good at telling a story. If you like a traditional museum this place is for you. "
Great place to learn about the history of Korea!,"I spent 3 hours in this marvelous place, only managed to go through the exhibit on 1st floor (out of 3 floors, plus special/seasonal sections). Had a better understand on the history of Korea, the various eras and dynasties, vs the development of surrounding countries such as ancient China, Japan etc. A must visit venue for the history buffs."
"Wow, A Must if for Nothing, But the Architecture","What an amazing place. It covers much of Korean history through art and artifacts including painting, furniture, needlework, pottery, and other things. It is well laid out in an expansive building that is wonderful. There is a spacious main hall with the exhibits off of this. The atrium entrance is stunning in it's design and we were wowed. We asked information about the architect and she told us that many visitors ask that question. We enjoyed the museum learning much about Korea and enjoying a Korean architects design. "
A look into Korean culture,"It is the right place to see, learn & understand the True Korean culture. rich history of Korean is on display here... worth Spending whole day here.."
Informative Overview of Korean History,"I visited the National Museum on my own while on a family vacation. This is an expansive complex that is impressive in its own right. Space is scarce in Seoul, so experiencing the landscaped grounds and the massive building itself is already notable. This is a good break from much of Seoul's commercialism, and it is a good way to spend a cold or rainy day. The main museum would not be fun for kids; it's geared for high school students at a minimum.Getting there: You can get there from the Ichon Station on the Seoul Metro #4 line. This line is convenient because it also runs through Seoul Station and Myeongdong. You need to travel some distance from the stop itself, through two moving walkways, and up weaving stairs. It's possible to travel the entire distance on wheelchair, but if you have trouble walking it is quite a trek.First Floor: If you go through the first floor by beginning on the right side as you enter and proceeding counter-clockwise the exhibit will unfold chronologically from prehistoric times to the beginning of the 20th century. As an American, it's impossible to see Korean history in such quantity at one time. It's quite a treat!Special Exhibit: I was able to see a very manageable but very informative exhibit of the much-overlooked Baekje Kingdom, which goes through the end of January 2017.2nd and 3rd Floors consist of donated works, calligraphy/painting, Asian art, and sculpture/crafts. I did not see these floors.Building: The building itself is extremely large. Others have commented that the museum feels relatively empty. To me, this is a plus. Visitors can explore at their own pace and don't have to worry about being swept up in the crowds.English language: There are a few English language tours, an English language map, and an audio guide which I did not use. Each major section has a good English introduction, and most artifacts have at least an English label."
Very Informative and can spend hours reading~~,"The National Museum of Korea is easily accessible using the subway. Get to the Ichon station, which is on the 4th line, and there should be signs showing directions to the museum. The museum is about Korean history that starts off from the very beginning to the end of Joseon dynasty. Would recommend to museum loving enthusiasts or anyone that wants a piece of Korean history!"
Awesome place to visit,The place has a lot of history an tremendous teaching areas. It provides ample learning of tools for all those who visit it.
Fun Experience of a Museum,It's a good place if you want to learn Korean History and I would say that it's one of the biggest museum that I visited in Korea. I think going to this museum is enough for you who wants only a brief history of Korea. It's an indoor activities and english services are provided. 
Huge museum...,"Good place to spend a few hours to know about Korea history and the treasures of Korea. The place is huge so we first took the guided tour in English to get an overview of the museum. Only after that did we start exploring on our own.There is pretty good view outside of Namsan so a very nice picture spot. Food court is pretty good. As this is our first stop after landing in Seoul, it serves as a good introduction to Korean food."
Interesting,Very interesting place to visit. Very educational and hands-on experience is superb. A great place to spent time with your family especially for your kids.
"Impressive building, not enough exhibits","This building is very impressive and large, good to learn about Korean history and it was free entry on the day we went. Inside there are quite a lot of exhibits, but some are very repetitive and plain. One room of porcelain crockery doesn't really showcase much....all kind of blank with no motifs or designs. There are some things worth seeing but all in all it feels like the space could be used with a lot more exhibits. Good museum for Seoul, but on a global scale it's fairly average at best. Worth visiting if time to spare or interested in Korean history, but if pushed for time may be better places to visit"
A good way to know Korean history,"I spent four or five hours engrossed in the many exhibits. A good way to spend a wet day. The galleries are arranged by the periods in Korean history, from the paleolithic to the Joseon dynasty, and is an excellent introduction to the country's story.I felt however that the museum could have had more to say about Korea's interaction with its neighbours through the centuries -- trade, cultural, etc -- and about the modern period, including the years under Japanese rule.Then again, better not, as the museum seems to maintain a somewhat nationalistic tone.There is a food court within, with reasonably priced dishes.The museum is easily reached by metro. Get off at Ichon station (light blue line) and follow the signs from there."
National Museum,"Amazing museum. Free entrance. It has three floors with tons of exhibition room. It has a gift shop in every floor, also a food court. Translator, wheelchair rental. Beautiful landscape. Amazing museum"
This Place is Fabulous,"If you have time, be sure to go here. Easy by subway. There is a little store next to it where you can buy snacks. Entry is free. This is a huge modern building with some magnificent works in it. Does a very good job of telling Korean history from the very beginning. Will take an entire day if you let it. You can take photos inside."
A good place to have a cultural briefing about Korea,"I spend a whole day visiting this museum (and two next door). The view from the entrance is awesome.You can see the Tower. An excellent aspect I found was that the entrance is free (except for special exhibits). If you are interested in Korean history, this is the place to visit, although not everything is translated into English. But it is worthy every penny (not; it is free!) Do not miss the Hangeul Museum. It is a short distance from the National Museum (follow the signs). Get a good pair of shoes, since the whole visit demands some walking. "
Could spend a few days here,"The museum is big - really big. I only spent a few hours there before my legs started getting tired, but you can probably spend a few days here digesting all the exhibitions and artifacts in this museum. One note is that it is a substantial walk (although some of it is underground and protected from elements) from Ichon subway station to the museum.What is interesting is that the outside of the museum hold some of the greatest views in Seoul. There is a large man-made lake in front of the museum, as well as a large open area in the entrance of the museum. There is also an area where you have a great view of Namsan Mountain and N Seoul Tower.The museum inside is very modern and expansive. There is a lot of free space, though punctuated by a ten story pagoda in the lobby area of the museum. There are three floors filled with exhibits and artifacts. Definitely worth a visit of a few hours."
A Must See for Korean History and National Treasure Relics,"We spent 21/2 hours at the museum with our day tour guide who gave us a wonderful overview of some of the major exhibits. To do it justice would take 2-3 days. On entering the incredible building one is immediately attracted to the 10 story Gyeongcheonsa Pagoda at the end of the main hallway. Constructed in 1340 from marble rather than granite the pagoda is a Korean national treasure. It was stolen and shipped to Japan in 1907 but was returned in the 1960's after international pressure on the Japanese government.Also a must see are the various Buddhas and other historical artifacts that have amazing detail and workmanship.The museum was busy with many young students observing and making notes but at no time did it feel crowded because of its spaciousness.We also noted that the students were taking their excursion very seriously and well mannered. On leaving the Museum, we were pleasantly surprised that we were engaged (in English) by a small group of teenage students who wanted to try their language skills. The students were extremely polite and we had a pleasant conversation until we parted ways in the coach parking lot. We enjoyed the contact and the students seemed to as well."
Fabulous museum,"The National Museum of Korea in Seoul is a wonderful facility. It has wonderful Korean history items, but the buildings would be worth a visit if they were empty. Great experience!"
Somewhat Dissapointing,"This is a very large, impressive building(and grounds) that I believe was built in 2005. Unfortunately, while the building is large & impressive, the way artifacts are displayed seem like that of a much older,dated museum (bottom line- not very creative or interesting). It was difficult locating the museum, as it seemed like no residents have been, or even have heard of this museum.?!? Entry is free (must be funded by the government), yet there were just over a handful of visitors there(practically empty)- and this was on a rainy(perfect for going to a museum) day. If this museum was self-supporting, I imagine it would be hemorrhaging tens of thousands of dollars/day due to its' extremely low attendance. We had lunch at one of the (nearly empty)restaurants. While I love most Korean food, what we had was pretty bad.What a shame- a lot of money went into constructing this museum!"
Spend whole day there,"The museum is so big and they have great collections of different ages. Personally I was expecting more for them to be the ''national'' museum and Korea has so many amazing museums all over the country. Other museums in Seoul like Samsung museum was more impressive and they carry sophisticated products. But it's still a great museum with restaurants(okay) and cafes(great tea room) for spending your whole day. There are exhibits outside too. They provide museum study tour for children too, we saw korean families bringing their children and the kids join the tour by themselves(get a lunch break with their parents) but I don't know if they have one in English."
Well maintained artifacts and visitor-friendly museum,This Museum is recommended to travellers who wants to know more about the history of Korea. There are also souvenir items to be bought at an affordable prices.
Lovely building amd collection,Wonderful history lesson on Korean culture. Shame that the Joseon exhibition was closed but the other exhibitions made up for it. Audio guide could be improved.
Beautiful at night,I have been to the museum a couple of times. It has an impressive architecture and is particularly beautiful at night with its reflections in the front garden pond. Access to the museum is quite easy by subway and there is a special underground walkway going from the subway station to the museum. There are museum decorations along the subway so it make the walk less boring. There is a huge collection of historical items in the museum and a walk around its compound is enjoyable.
A must-see,"The museum is large, but easily accessible. Wheelchair users will find that many portions of the facility to easy to reach. You will see a wide range of history and art. You will learn about the nation's history, its rulers, wars, culture, art, and the people. Regardless of your interests, you will find something that grabs your attention.We went during a weekday and there were many school groups present. Even young children seemed to enjoy the place. There are several places to eat and to shop. The restrooms are clean.Amazingly, admission was free."
National Museum,The National Musem of Korea has rooms full of interesting displays. We enjoyed our visit and learned a lot about Korean History and Culture. Highly recommend spot. We lucked out and had a Korean tour guide walk through the museum with us. 
World-class museum,"I would highly recommend spending a few hours in the National Museum of Korea. The building itself is quite amazing with an obvious amount of Fung Shui consideration going into the layout. There's a fantastic view of the mountains and the Namsan Tower in the distance. The grounds with the pond and pagoda are well worth a stroll as well. All that's even before you even set foot inside!The main building with the permanent exhibits is free of charge. How can you beat that? Obviously the main focus is Korean history, beginning with prehistory. There are a few rooms of various other Asian cultures on the third floor though. These could probably be missed if you're tight on time or you've seen more extensive exhibits in other museums.The second floor is pretty amazing if you're a fan of pottery, as I am. I've never seen so much celadon ware in one collection before. Metalwork too is well represented.The special exhibition hall has a charge attached but at 5000 won (about $4.50 USD), I thought it was more than reasonable.Plan on at least 3 hours or two trips to do the place justice. As you would do with any other world-class museum."
Great free attraction ,We liked this museum. Had lots to see. Left us pondering. Great display of artefacts. Facilities were clean with drinking stations everywhere which was very useful. Lots of seating too. Nice views of Seoul N tower too. 
Definitely worth a visit,"Wonderful collection in an equally wonderful building, with extensive grounds. Very easily accessed by purpose built tunnel walkways from Ichnon subway station. There are free English language guided tours twice a day (11.00 & 14.30) - definitely worth joining to get an overview of the museum and to view the ""must sees"" before walking around at leisure. Our very knowledgeable guide spoke excellent English."
Stunning building,"The landscape and the building itself is worth visiting, never mind the exhibits ! I was very taken by the architecture of the building right from the entrance, the hallway etc. For unknown reason, there was hardly any visitor on the day I went. They do not charge admission but I rented the audio for self guided tour for SKW 1000 (approx US $1). The gift shops (one on each floor) have remarkable selection of souvenirs for more than reasonable price. "
Nice Museum!,"Nice museum, surrounded by great outdoor grounds for walking and taking pictures! Nicely laid out museum, easy to get around in, quite interesting, with a few shops and cafés/tearoom."
Intricate & Lovely!,"Awed by the grandeur of the palace. The biggest and the grandest of all the 5 palaces. There were a lot of people from different nationalities. Saw the 3 buddhas. It has the King’s office, A huge kitchen, king’s hall where he entertains his visitors. I even posed with the palace guards. Truly beautiful!"
Treasure,"Grand history and magnificent treasures!The park surrounding the huge museum is beautiful and a lot of local kids enjoyed it.It is free to enter and spans three floors, with a fantastic collection of art and ceramics from across Asia and Korean history. "
Worth a Visit and Very Informative,The National Museum of Korea will take you on a historical journey through the different ages of South Korea. 
Huge museum,Although the exhibits were not that many for its size . Definitely worth visiting though . Modern and welcoming 
Worth the visit.,"Main exhibition are entrance free, I happened to chance upon Hangul day when I went, they have some activities and performance at the atrium,Restaurants served proper food . You can take a walk in the Yongsan Family Park, which is located just next to the museum too."
Modern and Culture Information,"It's a modern and mixed with culture museum I think. We can see traditional clothes, traditional house, and other things. Also there is a museum shop if you want to buy the souvenirs. Clean toilets, visitor information. And good for you to come here with friends and family. Enjoy..."
It was mediocre. ,"Maybe because I was already tired from being at the War Museum just before visiting this place, but personally, I found the War Museum much more interesting. It was more so artwork here, and history of the artwork. "
Huge and intersting,"We spent our one rainy day in Seoul here. My husband moved at a very slow pace. He loved it! I people watched, and enjoyed wandering around the well laid out exhibits. We had lunch here, pretty decent food at a reasonable price. "
Beautiful garden & museum,"Really recommended to go to this museum. you can easily catch a train to go directly to the museum (green line). We spend 2-3 hour here, wandering through the garden and the hall. On occasions, there are outdoor theater as well (likes esplanade in Singapore)"
"Beautiful gardens, superb exhibitions.","To be honest, about half of the artefacts here are presented too drily, shorn of context in plain glass cabinets. Especially on the ground floor. However, the excellent exhibits on the top floor make it worth a visit. They include a moving, changing frieze of traditional Chinese painting, which is probably the single best thing I've ever seen in a museum anywhere in the world. The gardens are also fantastic: perfectly peaceful in the middle of one of the world's largest cities, very beautiful too. Walk over to 'Dragon Falls', it's simply idyllic!"
"Huge museum, great for art lovers","Very easy to get to, this museum is gigantic. I suggest wearing comfortable shoes and getting a good night's rest before entering.The collection is very impressive, and the souvenir shops have some great offerings. I recommend visiting this place once."
A nicely laid out museum,This location is walking distance from the Ichon and Seobinggo metro stops. The museum has several interesting displays that are worth seeing as well as a kids section. Next door is the Hangul Museum which is also a nice visit. Enjoy both in one trip!
Huge!,"This is a huge museum. I visited for a full day and only saw maybe half of the collection. Got tired. So, bring good walking shoes. Not a lot of places to eat around here. But maybe I just didn't know where to go. So you will end up eating inside the museum. Which is a bit pricy. Lots of old Korean jewelry in the collection when I was there. "
An excellent example of public architecture,"As with all my reviews to sights in Seoul I will preface this by advising visitors to carefully check opening days and times and whether timed entry tickets are needed to access certain parts of the attraction and also the times for booking guided tours in their language of preference – bearing in mind that numbers can be limitedThe reviews here are a little mixed. And I think the reason is that sometimes a building is better than the artefacts it is designed to accommodate. Not to denigrate the artefacts as many are fine objects in their own right and have historical and cultural significance for KoreaThe approach to the building engenders a sense of expectation. A wide open air stair case frames a panorama of north Seoul with the iconic Naksam Tower as a central focus in the distant horizon.Inside the cathedral like space is immense with the entrance being a spectacular rotunda formation soaring to a great height. The sense of space is exaggerated by use of simple finishes with cream/white marble and stone walls and floors. The entire building is an outstanding example of public architecture on a grand scaleVisitor amenities are excellent. Outside there are pleasant grounds which the hordes of visitors use for picnics and leisureWhen I visited there were numerous school parties dashing around trying to complete their ""I-spy"" books - they were noisy and intrusive - taking away some of the pleasure of the experiencePublic transport access is easy from the nearby Metro Station"
Place to go when you have some time to spare,"I have visited many museums and to be honest after a while they tend to become a blur. This one did not and I think that this was largely due to our English speaking tour guide (you have to book when you enter the museum) I learned so much. The childrens part is the usual hands on, dress up offered."
Average,"Reachable by train. but u need to walk 500 m after. dont worry, It has connection with the subway station. i stayed in lotte hotel seoul, and takes around 45 minutes to b there. its a big museum. too much space i think. :) collection r great yet its all abt korea. good for history subject student. and for those who curious abt the ancient of korea.  if you are adventurous person, dont put this on your list. good escape from the crowd of city. very nice view outside the building. "
Its ok...,"The museum building and grounds are very pretty and has its own train station.The first floor inside is the most interesting part in terms of history, everything else is for art lovers I guess and people who can appreciate ceramics. Would be great if they had more exhibits like maybe what prehistoric animals / dinosaurs they had in Korea.If you had to choose between this and the war museum, go to the war museum. Wouldn't spend too long here."
Really worth visiting,Very interesting building in its own right. The collections are very well organized especially if one is not too familiar with the very long history of Korea. The building is large and spacious so it takes some time to go through it even if one does not read everything. We signed up for the tour with one of the English speaking docents/guides. She was very informative and pointed to the exceptional pieces whether for their historical or artistic significance. 
A lot of things to see,"This museum is really big, if you want to get a closer look to everything you will need a few hours. Entrance is free, which is really great, that's whay you can't go wrong with going here. If you don't like it, just leave :)Although you can see a lot of things it can get a bit boring after seeing the 1000. Buddha statue."
Disappointing,"Not worth it unless you're bored and it's raining. I heard this is one of the biggest museums in Asia. Unfortunately I was underwhelmed. Huge space with little content. Also there was a HUGE exhibit for Dok island, which was a waste. The only thing they showed were pictures of rocks. "
Wow,"Probably one of the most impressive museums I've ever been to - just goes to show what museums can look like if they have enough funding! The exhibits themselves are fabulous - well researched, in-depth and such a huge variety of objects and approaches to their display. I especially enjoyed their approach to showing archaeological processes and finds. The architecture itself is impressive in itself - just enormous and so well-made. My only criticism would be that I thought the layout itself was a bit banal, arranging the exhibits in chronological order.Other than that, I could have spent hours in there just wandering around, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for an insight into Korean history. The shop also sells some beautiful objects (albeit expensive), and is well worth a look."
Huge museum,"Visited the national museum this august. As an Asian Studies student, it was quite intersting seeing how they kept referring to china in the museum, and it basically looked as though Korea is nothing more than a side effect of the chinese rise. The museum offers a free tour a couple of times a day. The guide didn't actually know english and basically just stated what's written about the artifacts, but it was still nice. I'd very much reccomend this place for a rainy day. It also has beautiful gardens nearby if you deel like a light stroll."
Refresh holiday,very good place to know korean history. kids can try to something and see some kind of show. there are many things to see.
National Museum of Korea,"This is a stunning, beautiful museum, worth the visit for the architecture. It is tourist friendly, with frequent quiet spots to sit and rest, water fountains,and restrooms available. The artwork is world class, and there is a children's area the kids will want to spend time at.The outside is as beautiful as the inside. "
"Huge, impressive collection with lots of tour options","We spent an afternoon touring around the National Museum of Korea recently and were very impressed. The museum grounds are absolutely lovely. We would recommend walking around the museum to see the reflecting pond, pagoda garden, and other peaceful sights during your visit. The museum collection itself is spectacular with a wide range of artifacts. We took a free guided tour in English and would advise other foreigners to do the same. The museum was crowded with school groups during our visit and it would have been tough to navigate the crowds without our guide. We also learned a lot about the history of Korea on our tour. The museum building is beautifully clean and modern. It also has an excellent gift shop on the 3rd floor where I bought several nice quality souvenirs inexpensively. We definitely plan to return to the museum during a less crowded time so we can see more of the collection. Our favorite items in the collection from our first visit were the Buddha statues."
Great museum with an even greater gift shop,Best place to buy souvenirs while in Korea. You can find anything in the museum gift shop for anyone of any age. Check out the great calendars. 
Everything you need to know is here ,From the bronze dynasty to the baekje silla goguryeo dynasty to the current era. Everything you need to know is here. There are a number of national treasure displays here. The best part of the whole visit is free of charge.
"huge museum, free entry","The museum is huge, with exhibits spanning across all of Korea's history. We were told that there was limited English, but there were actually a lot of descriptions and signs written in English, it was only some more detailed descriptions on artifacts that was not in English, so don't worry if the audio guide sells out as you will still be able to understand everything. We spent almost a whole day inside, and spent the afternoon/evening wandering around the grounds outside, which I would highly recommend doing if the weather is good. The entry to the museum is free but I would have happily paid!"
Amazing,"This is a beautiful building. Although we did not know when we arrived, but the subway stop for this museum has an exit on the museum grounds. It has a fabulous collection, both of prehistory artifacts and items throughout the ages. I especially like the porcelain collection. "
"Excellent, Very Large Museum","This is an excellent museum. It is huge. If you spend even a minimal amount of time looking through the exhibits, you will need a full day to see them. However, you can find the highlights in a couple of hours. Some of the most spectacular exhibits for many Westerners are probably clustered around room 108, where the golden crown is located, on the ground floor. The restaurant is good, but it has a limited Western menu, and is rather expensive: spaghetti with meat sauce and a soft drink for two was about 45000 KRW. Be advised that if you have limited mobility, you can probably get the taxi driver to take you into the parking structure beneath the museum, from where you can take elevators or escalators directly into the museum without too much walking. However, the museum staff will not call a taxi for you. You have to walk several blocks out the front of the museum to get to a main street from which you can catch a taxi to return."
Great if you have all day to spend,Get there by line 4 at Ichon station. There are wonderful ground and multi-level floors with exhibits. I am not a great lover of museums and got overwhelmed with this museum.
Interesting museum ,"If you're interested in Korean history, then this museum is great for you. It's a big museum that takes a few hours to walk around. It's also free entry. "
Beautiful museum in the heart of Seoul,"Beautiful place to visit. I ♡ museums so trying to visit every national museum whenever I get a chance to go. If you are in Korea, I strongly recommend this museum in Seoul. There is also great museum to visit in Kyongju. Folk museum in Suwom is also great place to visit. :) Very easy excess from the metro station and if the weather is good, you can walk around the museum as well. I have post some photos and hope you all can ejoy them! "
Amazing exhibits,Good English descriptions of exhibits covering a wide and varied historical perspective of Korean history and culture. Superb pottery dating back to the 12th century. Well worth visiting for anyone who wants to learn about Korean culture and history - many Koreans appreciate this museum too and take their children on weekends to learn about their unique heritage. That is a sure sign of its significance and value. A must see while in Seoul!!
Kids Museum,"When traveling with kids, it is always good to know where to go with them, if the weather is not so good. The kids museum at the National Museum of Korea is one great option. Just be aware, there are time slots which can be either booked online, or on site. Once your time slot is over, you have to leave. Depending on the amount of people going in, you can go in a second time, but this might be dependent on your time and date (not in heigh season presumably). Kids can enjoy and learn hands on while at the museum."
Amazing museum,"This museum is amazing. The place is simply massive. It includes exhibits not only from Korea, but from all over Asia. We spent a half day here, and only left because we were getting hungry. You could easily spend an entire day. Admission is free, and the location is easy to access from the metro."
Must see - completely free!!!,"Like so many attractions in Seoul, the Nat'l Museum is free. It's large and clean with air conditioning and free wifi, making it a perfect stop in a busy day of sightseeing. Obviously it doesn't compare to some of the world's greatest but you can't beat the price."
This place is huge!,Large and extensive collection of artifacts and details about Korea's long history. Good for people who have an interest and/or want to learn more about Korea. Commit a few hours as it is quite large.
National Museum ,Dont miss this opportunity to visit the national Museum in Seoul. Really it is well organised and the way they present the history is wonderful 
"In-Detch, Challenging, Well Done!","This was a really great experience. I learned a lot about Korean history and culture from walking through this museum. If you are only in Seoul a short time, or if you do not have a historical perspective already, this is a must-experience attraction."
Good overview of history of Korea,"Not much of a museum visitor, but went with family and surprisingly enjoyed it. The museum was able to grab my attention as the ""flow"" was telling a interesting story in time. "
Beautiful building and fine collection - well worth a visit,"Reached easily via an underground travellator from the nearby Metro station, the National Museum is certainly worth a visit. The permanent exhibits range over three beautiful floors, the ground level being particularly pleasing aesthetically and architecturally.The Museum is free to everyone. It includes an terrific lounge/relaxation area and delightful grounds to stroll and spectacular views on one side."
Modern museum of historical exhibits,Impressive array of Korean historical and religious exhibits. Beautiful Buddist sculptures and statues. 
Well curated and worth a visit if you are interested in history,"August is a v hot month and to escape the heat, we visited the museum. At 2pm we went on a guided tour that lasted 1.5 hrs. It was great (esp since there were only 2 of us!). Guide was an elderly Korean gentleman who piqued our interest about Korean history so much so that we bought 'A Brief History of Korea' at the museum shop! "
Detailed Korean history and culture,National Museum of Korea is subdivided into many areas. Exhibiting the different dynasty that ruled over Korea
what a find dont miss,"close by the castle the museum was one of the highlights of our tour you can buy a ticket for both given you a discount, loved the way that the museum was laid out which made it very easy to view all the contents which covered over five floors"
A must if you wanna know about Korea,"A place to get all the important facts (and much much more if interested) about the Korean peninsula since palaeolithic era until today. History and art in one place. I went there with the idea of spending one morning there and ended up spending 8 hours. A huge collection! Don't worry if planning on engaging on a long visit - there's a restaurant with a huge selection of Korean (but also international) dishes. The place itself is quite cool too. And there is a huge park outside with a pond and a some pagoda's (and there's another museum, a smaller one, in the same park). Huge, great and beautiful - just go!"
Remarkable!,"Remarkable collections covering every periods in the Korean history, plus items from other parts of the world too. I started the visit sometime around 10 in the morning and when the museum to close at 6, there were still rooms I have not yet covered! Highly recommended for history-lovers!"
Definitely worth visiting ,"Except for the location where there's not much things to eat or do around, National Museum of Korea will be able to give you a great insight on Asian art. It's a very modern building with small but serene garden front and back which you can take a small walk around. It's even free! There's sometimes other art or photography exhibitions organized which you must pay to enter. The exhibitions they hold were mostly good. "
Good Free Museum,Free museum that tells the young history of Korea. I learned a lot from its time lined exhibit. There was a free photos shots we could take and print for ourselves. i.e. I love Korea. 
Place to visit,Lots to see and learn. Is a good place to visit with the family. You can easily sent hours admiring everything in the museum. 
Great but too many people,"It's great way to learn about their history, but don't do it on a weekend. There are just so many people running all over the place."
Grand history but explanation is bad," The whole museum is very massive and entrance fee is free! Grand history and magnificent treasures! Long live the Korea!So the rate is 5 point 5. Wait! But the explanation words are so small that even Korean people don't know what is treasure or replica. (When I watched the national treasure, one Korean woman said ""Oh, it is good replica!"".) And my eyes were tired to read that tiny words. So I would rate -1."
Don't recommend except you really want to know the ancient history of Korea,"The building of the national museum of Korea is magnificent and it's free besides the special exhibitions. The reason why I came there is I'm interested in the contemporary history of Korea and I thought there must be some exhibitions about the miracle of Han river, the democratic movement, etc.. But at last I found the content of the museum is only about the ancient history and its items."
Impressive but not as vast as I would've expected,"I could sum up the content in this museum as the history of Korea, dating from items found by archaeologists hundreds or thousands of years ago, the history of civilisations throughout the centuries, art and sculptures and Buddhist statues from various time periods, etc.It's all quite interesting, and much more history than my own country can display, but it gets a bit overwhelming after a while.Well worth a visit, especially since it's free, but while you could spend 2 hours there, you could see enough in half an hour to satisfy you."
"Enjoy, enjoy and once more enjoy","The arrival there is made very simple and easy, so much so you can easily visit with whatever weather. The park surrounding the huge museum is beautiful and a lot of local kids enjoyed it. I at first visited the right now ongoing exhibition on Sinan Shipwreck and found it very interesting along with impressing, worth the 5000 won I payed to see treasures of a past time. From there I moved into the free National Museum, where you could probably spend a day or several taking in the huge collection. I ended up picking specific rooms to go to in order not to lose myself in the huge establishment. There are walking tours at certain times - I decided to explore on my own. Once you enter the rooms of the displays quiet surrounds you along with beautiful pieces of art. It was a bit distracting with the loud children, but then again that is nothing is new either. There are rooms upon rooms filled with treasures - the signs are in Korean, English, Chinese and Japanese. Outside the spaces are several bathrooms and places where you can have a drink of water. The building is huge and a wonderful trip all together.Only thing I have to admit is that the architecture part didn't really overwhelm me - the interior is beautiful and clear cut, the outside look is okay. P.S. Was lucky enough to even catch a live performance before the entrance to the museum."
Museum of Space,"So i decided to pick this one as it is the best, as stated, and to learn something about Korea in its history and culture throughout the years....The structure looks humongous from the outside, and it is large inside too. So much space to move around.I just strolled, and hardly stopped to look at anything, as I found nothing really interesting in general about their display. Most of their artifacts or objects looked way too polished and ""complete"" I wondered if they were just replica and made up stuff. I just don't think things that were from hundreds of years ago could be this ""unharmed"" and ""shinny"". Then, the whole impression of it was, it was a display of porcelain or china by some rich people at their huge mansion. Also, their history is just a minor China alike impression and for me, I felt like nothing was new or worth the learn. The South East Asian hall along with Central Asia and Japan are just as equally pathetic with just few things on display, as if it is collectibles of one's travel souvenirs, I was absolutely dumbfounded! The whole museum is just ""SPACIOUS"", you may now try to define this word here after reading my comments about this point of no interest. Only good thing is, people, be informed, it is FREE!!!!!!!!!!!!!The other hall which is an exhibition hall, where we paid W5000 literally for nothing to see bunch of, guess what, MORE china and porcelain from a shipwreck! What a waste of money and time! Bummer!!!!!!!!!!!!!Please! If this is voted the best, I guess I wouldn't have to chance on others then, well, I do not plan to return to Korea in the near future anyway, because just like the museum, it has no culture or manners.Taipei National Palace Museum and Shanghai Museum, they are what museums should be!"
Beautiful Museum,"This was such a pleasant surprise!The grounds were beautiful and well kept - take some time to look around before entering.It was the perfect rainy day activity and I spent about 4 hours in total. They have free English guides at 10, 11 and 2pm and I highly recommend it. Plus this museum is FREE! Bonus: it is pleasantly air conditioned and has free WiFI. It was great to learn about Korean history and culture. Closest subway stop: Ichon Enjoy! "
"Walk, Look and Enjoy the Treasures","For a pleasant afternoon of history and art, this is a great venue for foreigners to visit. From the welcoming flowers at the entrance, the scenic gardens, gift shops, and the vast selection of history, there is something for just about everyone. There is an ease in which you can stroll thru the exhibits, read the placards (yes, they are in English too) and take in the vast and rich collections on display. Several stories tall, you might find that you need a break after a bit; they have a small cafe to enjoy refreshments and to sit and catch your breath. I would say that if you read placards and keep an even pace, you can do all three floors in an afternoon. The gardens are great for a stroll and you can meander over to the other museum on the grounds. Check their website for special exhibits and shows!! Oh, and if you're worried about finding the National Museum, it is quick walking distance to the subway.....try right at the entrance. Head to Ichon station and have fun!"
Gorgeous in every way,"The museum is bracketed by a large park which is definitely worth a stroll in before/after you visit the museum. It is free to enter and spans three floors, with a fantastic collection of art and ceramics from across Asia and Korean history. The audio guide I found to be non-essential, but does add to the experience and your understanding of the relics and their importance. If you book one, make sure to grab the mp3 for a cheap 1000won instead of the PDA (comes with pictures). Very tourist friendly with English/Chinese explanations on the walls. The only hazard you will face may be hoards of school children here on excursion."
Most beautiful museum in Seoul !!,This museum was one of the highlights of my Korea trip. It is located a short 10 minute walk from Yongsan station. The outside area is stunning and perfect for a warm summer's or spring day to stroll around. One of the museum's staff gave us a free tour around and I learned so much about the Korean culture and it's history. The interior has a very contemporary feel and it's big inside with lots of well kept Korean treasures beautifully displayed and well maintained. I have never been to such a beautiful museum and the best thing was the entrance is free. I will definitely go back to this place on my next visit to Seoul. Highly recommend this!! 
Full of history,I really didn't read about the Korean history but when I visited the museum I learned a lot. However the museum was so empty and I felt sad about it!
Modern museum in perfect park,Easy to get to on the metro. Great museum with interning floors showing the countries timeline. There are cafes and restaurant and picnic area. You must talk a walk outside where there are outdoor exhibits in lovely planted gardens with pools and lakes. Very popular with Korean families.
Just the grounds alone are worth it,"Situated on an enormous plot of land in this immense city, the dedication of this city to art is admirable. The building is outstanding, with an immense atrium surrounded by large display spaces, the objects very attractively arranged. Not everything is in English, but you can get the audio guide. And, dont expect European art here: this is Asean, mostly Buddhist. Outside, the park is an oasis of calm, with ponds and pavilions."
Good for a rainy day,"This is a large museum with facts and information about Korea. We found ourselves going here while it was raining, and it made for a good rainy day activity. The museum had a lot of great history about Korea and included many interesting things."
Korea 2016,Loved this museum. Well laid out and easy to navigate. Beautiful works of art! A must see the first time you go to Seoul.
Not very busy,Very spacious museum . There are not a lot of visitors. I feel very relax and enjoy my visit there. The ginseng latte is very good in the coffee shop. Also free Wi-Fi and free admission.
Loved it,This was great to learn the history of south korea and they had lots of interactive things inthe museum along with examples of attire and living quarters etc over the years. 
Architectural marvel homing historic collection,Another grand installation in Seoul displaying Korean history in a grandeur setting. But the facility is not wheel chair friendly.
Just Fabulous,"It is so pleasing to get access to such a great museum for free. Anyone interested in the origins of the nation will learn a great deal.There is a guided tour in English that commences at 2PM and is highly recommended. Our guide was very passionate and the tour went to 4PM with great explanations of various aspects of Korean culture.We were so pleased and keen to contribute at the end, we decided to patronise the lovely café and enjoy a bit of Korean cuisine."
Historic artefacts,"A large modern museum with plenty of ancient Korean exhibits over three floors. Plenty of restrooms, cafe and gift shop. "
Arts and artifacts,The national museum is worth a look it displays alot of history about their dynasty and cultural and religious artifacts. It's 3 levels and have escalators end of each level. It also has some displays of other cultures that existed over the years. It's air-conditioning and quite comfortable to walk around 
Spacious Museum,This is a very very large Museum. That said the display space was about normal. Each floor of galleries has it's own emphasis. The shop has many wonderful gift ideas. Admission is free of charge. Now the grounds and the view up to Namsan are spectacular.
Worth the visit,Do consider spending a few hours to appreciate the different sections of this spacious museum. Artefacts are rich in historical value. Consider getting the audio guide to help you understand better. An educational trip which you can make on your own. By subway: Jungang Line Ichon Stn. 150 m towards Yongsan Family Park from Exit 2 orLine 4 Ichon Stn. 150 m towards Yongsan Family Park from Exit 2 (source: english.visitseoul.net)
A more spectacular edifice you will not find . . .,"Worth seeing for the facility alone, frankly. Very spacious and many interesting displays. We only had about 2 hours, not really enough, but still got a lot out of the visit. Definitely a top attraction from the places we visited in Seoul especially as we had rain part of the day."
Nice small museum,"I always visit the national museum of the country I visit and so I did the same while in Seoul. It's relatively a small museum when compared to The Louvre, Armitage, and other major museums in Europe and North America. But it is worth visiting. I also enjoyed the coffee shop there. Photos attached."
A beautiful building but boring exhibits.,Hundreds of pots and vases. Lacked life and interactive displays. A nice tea house. Special exhibition area very disappointing.
Nice... interesting.. ,Liked the visit and some sections were interesting however a little to much pottery and roof tiles.Good activity if weather too wet or too hot. Free as i recall. The hours of operation can be late 8pm on certain nites of week.Also acces via underground tunnel directly from ichon subway station.
Amazing views,"I have yet to go inside because of time but I really enjoyed staying outside in the plaza and park. The cantilever frames the axis and really is a nice place to chill with family, "
Excellent facilirtes and collection and also free of charge.,I recommend the English speaking tours which are conducetd by volunteers. Check with website for the scheduled tours. 
Interesting history and artifacts,"Lots of beautiful pieces from Korean history and arts: buddhas, celadon, lacquered boxes, etc. Beautiful grounds, as well. Restaurant serves Italian pasta, as well as Korean food."
Amazing Building and displays,"This building and the grounds are fantastic. Probably the best thing that we saw in Seoul. The artwork and historical treasures are amazing. Most of the descriptions of the works are in English. Allow yourself at least a day to ""do"" this place maybe more if you are into antiquities. There is food available and caters to Western tastes, As in all of Korea, the toilets are spotless."
Great overview of Korean history and culture - a must see!,"Impressive building and exhibits. Exhibits are extensive and well presented, with most interpretive signs in Korean and English. There is much to be learned from a visit here. Admission is free."
What an impressive place!,"We had a 7am family photoshoot here with a professional photographer and found the surroundings of the museum to be very beautiful and well maintained. Clearly, the city takes a great pride in its museum. The scale of the enormous buildings are also something else to behold - truly impressive. Unfortunately, we didn't get to go into the museum itself as we had to leave at 9am but the surround park is definitely worthwhile as a visit."
Detailed museum with good variety of arts and crafts,Be prepared to spend 3-4 hours here enjoying the huge variety of art from throughout Korean history. The museum is well-organized and guides also have listings of highlight exhibits for those with less time (also good to make sure you don't miss key pieces). Audio guides are provided for those with more time (which I sadly lacked). There is also a section of non-Korean arts and crafts as well. 
Go to the Leeum instead,"The National Museum in Ichon is housed in a nice building with a decent view of Namsan, but the displays are fairly boring. If you want to see some of the more beautiful artifacts medieval Korea produced, I'd recommend the Leeum (between Itaewon and Hangangjin stations)."
History & Culture,Anyone interested in the history of Korea this is the place to visit. I had a great time exploring the exhibits!!! It had 3 floors and a place to eat at the top floor.
Nice museum ,you can start in national museum of Korea from the stone time to before smart phone a little time it's great place to know the area history not only Korea history 
You should visit here!,"Nice beautiful vase and all the treasures you can see. I can't remember it was free but it was pretty cheap at least. The building is new, a small house on the lake is not an old one, but still beautiful at day and night! Nice museum! :) "
Definately a GO,"Impressive building, free of charge and quite organized. There are few good coffee shops inside the museum with good views, prices are affordable considering free entrance to a good museum"
Throwback to Korean History,"This museum is full with korean history, and many cultural things from ancestors is showed there. I remember there are a few buildings : exhibition and museum. We can choose what to see first. But since the area is so large, better to prepare your feet to walk. There's free drinking water inside so don't worry if u get exhausted."
Always love coming back here,I had a very good time here last year visiting the Polish Exhibition of historical Art from Poland. I have visited this Museum on a number of occasions and enjoy coming back each time for something new. Easily accessible - I took a taxi from Yonsan station and it took about 8 minutes or less. There is a lovely garden in front of it that surrounds a pond. The Museum building has a modern structure and clean lines. I will be back in the near future.
"Huge! Of you love museums, this one will take up most of your day!","-Free admission.-The little convenience stores on site don't jack up the price of good by much. -Don't miss the outdoor sections as well if you come during the spring/summer/fall. They were very beautiful, especially the dragon waterfall."
Interest exhibits,Be prepared to walk as its huge with 3 floors of exhibits. Do check if the special exhibits are open as they close on some days. It's free and very well maintained. We were tired so only managed to see 1-1/2 floors on our own. Would probably be better if we paid for a guide. Entrance is FOC.
Amazing Calligraphy,"One of the most impressive museums I ever visited, the accessibility of the museum is great, near a metro station.The museum is huge, you can spend here 4-5 hours easily.I really recommend the Calligraphies sections of the museum, there are some amazing art works there and also informative explanation on that unique art.I were there on a weekend during the summer vacation and it was great to see there local Korean families, couples and friends enjoy the museum silently and seriously as part of their culture, it was one example out of many to the uniqueness of the Korean people."
"History of Korea and various parts of Asia, an interesting and informative visit.","Took the subway to the nearby station and it's a short, mostly sheltered walk to the museum. The gardens surrounding the museum are really pretty in spring, it would be good to take a walk around before going inside the museum itself. Inside, the museum is as expected -- many, many artifacts from Korea dating back to the Stone Age. I didn't get an audio guide, but reading the info boards sufficed for me. The museum itself is huge, with exhibits from different parts of Asia. However, it can get disjointed at some points because of the abrupt transitions between different geographical areas. I spent 1.5 hours in the museum, but it was definitely too little if you're interested in exploring the whole museum. If you want to explore everything thoroughly/are a history buff, a day is recommended. Otherwise, a half a day visit should be enough."
Rich in Culture,"Great view outside the Museum and even inside. they offer English tour guide and give brief story how once Korea was united. You'll learn more on their culture and traditions. Josean Era and Era before that, Koreans are very artistic and stylist from the very beginning. Don't forget that taking pictures are not allowed in other parts inside the Museum. "
"Huge, Interesting Museum","This is the 6th largest museum in the world. The massive size is an attraction of itself. The museum is Free (closed Monday) and easy to get to by Subway (line 4). There are 3 floors. The first floor is the most important as it discusses Korean history (via artifacts) from Prehistoric times to the Joeson dynasty. There are large # of displays and I would recommend obtaining an audio guide (3,000 won, need ID for deposit). The audio guide provide details for about 50% of the displays. If you listen to all the audio stops, you could easily spend several hours.Also recommended is the free English tour (1 hour). Our guide was very informative and provide perspective about Korean history and culture. Unlike the audio guide, which provides a snippet of information (30-60 seconds) per exhibit, the guide will spend 3-5 minutes on a display to go into much greated depth and detail.The 2nd and 3rd floors have ""miscellaneous"" exhibits. While of interest in their own right, it seems more ""disjointed"" than coherent."
Massive Korean museum,"The National Museum of Korea is huge and full of every Korean artifact imaginable. It's a rainy day location for sure. Your enjoyment of this museum will depend on how well you appreciate Korean art, but if you are bored in one section you can walk (a long distance) to get to another section. Definitely check out the celadon pottery area."
Architecture & History lovers,"If you have 4-5 hours, then it really deserves to pay a visit. Firstly the museum itself is great, secondly it exhibits a pretty comprehensive collection that starts from Paleolithic Era to Joseon Dinasty. If you want to know more about Korea's history, then it's a must!"
Rotating exhibits can be wonderful,"Nothing new and grande here if you have been to other ""ceramic"" museums in Asia, with that being said, they often have guest exhibits that can really turn a rainy day into a wonderful day. Keep your eye peeled for what's on guest display."
Great art,"Great for rainy days. Lots of art and they offer multiple languages tours but when I was there he tour was a coupe hours so I took the self guided tour and payed 3000 won for the recorded I wouldn't recommend it, you can walk around the museum by yourself. "
Free and interesting,"Visit on rainy day, interesting facts and items about Koreas' history. Helps a lot to know Koreas' history beforehand. "
Well worth the price of admission!,"We spent 1/2 day here exploring this museum and its lovely grounds.Considering the free admission price, this is definitely the best attraction for the money in all of Seoul.Don't miss the nearby ""Hangul Museum"" which has many Korean language exhibits (also free)."
National Museum of Korea,"Museum had lots of artifacts of the history of Korea, not so much with paintings but with stone and gold work as well as some jewels. Depending on your interest can spend an hour to several hours. Grounds are spread out and can find plenty of places to sit and enjoy the garden areas."
Wealth of Korean Treasures ,"Every time I travel I make sure to look for museums. This trip is definitely no exception. To say that one appreciates the Korean culture is an understatement because the culture is complex as their history. To fully appreciate them, one must be open-minded, free from stereotypes, and with a deep sense of craving to understand what makes them who they are today. The best place to get this wealth of information is their National Museum. This place is kids friendly :) "
Huge museum,"I spent over a day at this museum. There are several floors and there are dozens of artifacts from each period in Korean history, as well as from each kingdom. The museum has an overwhelming amount of artifacts. The first floor starts from ancient history and works its way toward the present, but for someone who is not already familiar with ancient Korean history, this might be a little difficult to thoroughly enjoy. Each period of history is presented separately, making it difficult to really understand an overall picture of Korean history. Also, it is hard to imagine the artifacts in context. That being said, the amount and scope of artifacts make this a good place to visit if you have lots of time and enjoy seeing ancient pottery, etc. The gardens outside the museum are nice and have a children's park and pagodas.If your time is very limited in Seoul, the National Palace Museum might be a better choice. It deals more with Joseon dynasty royalty but is smaller and easier to appreciate. "
Amazing insight to this wonderful country,"I must confess that my knowledge of S Korea was limited to what we see on TV, so it was a surprise to see the rich customs, tradition and history in one location. It was a pleasant eye opener, and a great way to learn about this wonderful country and its people. Well worth a visit."
The most full of knowledge museum ,It was the most amazing and knowledgeable museum about Asian countries history there was different way to introduce the information by pictures or TV with vedio in korean and English it was for free 
Beautiful collection and building.,"Very nice half day excursion. Good restaurant food as well, no alcohol unfortunately, what a difference a nice glass of wine would have made. Take the metro to this location. We thought we could walk as the map shows various roads but the park/museum is surrounded on three sides by an enormous US government property which we ended up walking around, as the roads are inside the enclave. Only access is at the south end. "
FABULOUS!,"The museum far exceeded my expectation. I had less than 90 minutes and would have loved at least another hour. There was so much to see--and the exhibits were so varied. The grounds were beautiful, but it was raining so I didn't get to stroll. My favorite exhibit was the statues of the Buddhas. The gift shop was excellent. I would have loved to have tea in the cafe and take a leisurely look at more of the exhibits. "
Unique educational and cultural experience,"While most of the world's great museums have their showpiece exhibits made up of artefacts from Ancient Egypt, Greece, and Rome, this museum is has a uniquely Korean focus, with a each room a step in the story of the evolution of Korea. The organisation and level of curation is on par with any museum in the world, and shows a side of Korea away from K-pop and TV melodramas. There is an entire separate hall for special exhibits, such as collections of Western art on loan from other major centres."
A treasure trove of history,"It is an absolute delight to go through the Museum with thousands of exhibits not just of Korean history but of civilisation as a whole. The Koreans have done a fantastic job in excavating and preserving their history and there are so many museums in Korea that have this on display for the general public. I am grateful to the patronage of so many donors who have researched and donated their priceless artifacts to the museum. It is a huge place, you can spend hours or days going through it. I am grateful to the Korean government for its lavish contribution in creating it, maintaining it and keeping it free......Just kept thinking of the destruction in Palmyra as I was going through this amazing place.."
Impressive and massive museum ,"From the aircraft, ship displays, gifsbtif monuments outside to the massive and impressive museum inside this is a MUST SEE on your trip to S. Korea. The museum will take you about 4 hours to walk through. It explains all wars Korea has been through starting back in the pre historic time running through to present. Korea has an extensive history which we found very interesting. "
Fantastic,"High class Museum. Very modern design, easy navigation through the various rooms and topics, large enough not to be crowded, concise explanations (in English too), free (yes!) ... and fantastic items on show. It was a pleasure all the way visiting this Museum. Note: If you just want to walk through, only stopping briefly in front a few spectacular pieces, I guess about 1.5 hrs are necessary. A more quiet visit may need about twice as much. I'd advise at least 2 hrs and be selective as there are very diverse topics exposed that are not likely to be of interest for everybody."
Beautiful Museum,The museum itself is housed in a gorgeous and enormous modern building. I enjoyed the layout of the museum that really walked you through the history of the peninsula from a prehistory perspective to the influences throughout the peninsula and how Korea became what it is today. I think the museum did an outstanding job of mapping out this journey. Get the museum map so you can make sure you follow it! Give yourself plenty of time. We didn't have time to go through the entire museum as I would have liked. I think 4 hours would have been plenty of time to go through each floor (3 floors)! Someone said that the museum was FREE? It's not. You pay on the outside and then enter. There's no one there taking tickets. I've noticed that Koreans are very trustworthy and use the honor system. The cost is about $13 USD or so... well worth it and in my opinion an awesome price!The museum also had a great cafe and area with small restaurants. We had coffee but if we didn't have reservations for a late lunch we would have totally ate there! They even had gourmet hotdogs which looked awesome.This is definitely a must see museum and another place to take amazing pictures inside and outside!
Beautiful!,"Lovely building in a gorgeous, peaceful setting. Art and history are displayed thoughtfully throughout the museum....open and inviting. Items on display often took ones breath away ... stunning! I took a tour with a museum volunteer (in English) which was chock full of facts about Korea and its history."
"Beautiful museum, and it's FREE!","We enjoyed the Children's section of this museum and the main exhibits were a nice look at some of Korea's history. Best of all, the museum is free!"
A Temple for the Arts,This modern building houses the collection from the very beginnings to the last king. All items are presented professionally and you can get an audio tour that highlights some main exhibits. Nice cafeteria at the top level.
Korea Museum,"This place is one of my favorites to study Korean cultures. In the museum, you will be able to see lots of old things like boat, jewelry, statues and etc."
Best museum in Seoul,Art and relics are astounding. Well laid out. Gift shop is superb. Had a great time viewing prehistoric relics to well preserved national treasures.
"Big, Beautiful, and Free!","The National Museum of Korea is great place to spend an hour or so exploring Korea's history. The outside area that leads up and surrounds the museum is beautiful and serene. Inside the museum there is a vast array of stunning history pieces and what makes it even better is that the museum is free! They do have special monthly that do cost money, but the history museum is free to the public."
National museum worth the visit ,Recommend visiting the national museum to exposure yourself to the history and national treasures of Korea. Nice gift shop too. 
Adequate,"Very focused on Korea, China & Japan, with not many artifacts from other parts of the world unlike peer museums in Tokyo or UK for example. However it was still fine for me as I was only looking to learn about Korean history and they did a good job at that."
Fabulous building - great space,"Worth a visit to this lovely (free) museum. Easy to get to on the metro - three floors charting the history and artefacts of Korea - so in a very real sense it's a national museum. It concentrates solely on Korea - but I loved it, it was spacious - we went on a Saturday and it seems that is a school day as it was full of children - who surprisingly were not that well behaved - the space seemed to encourage them to run riot which was a bit surprising.The exhibits are a combination of historical artefacts, modern media and IT and it's very well balanced - I'd like the chance to go again. It's set in a large park which was also nice to explore and it's close to the metro - like everything else in Seoul - it's well connected "
"Nice, interesting","The museum is very nice, clean, and neat.Entrance is for free to the museum, and have scheduled free english tours."
Th National Museum of Korea - One of Asia's Great Muaeums,"THE NATIONAL MUSEUM OF KOREA….ONE OF ASIA’S GREAT MUSEUMSThis is a truly amazing museum, set up in a very large functional building of contemporary design. Its exhibits are arranged in various period galleries – covering pre-history and ancient history of Korea, medieval and early modern history, calligraphy and painting, Asian art, as well as Korean sculpture and arts. The Pre-history and Ancient History Gallery starts with the Paleolithic and Neolithic Periods, and covers the ascent of various Korean kingdoms, up to the Balhae kingdom. Among the exhibits are ancient farm implements, clay pottery of considerable geometrical accuracy, a range of weapons including steel swords, daggers, spearheads, arrowheads, and axes. There is a beautifully-carved stone dagger, as well as stone tools, wood implements and the like from the Bronze Age. Among other exhibits of that period are a milling stone to grind acorn, and an early example of a dugout canoe. Korea’s Unified Silla Period is represented by a very ornamental gold crown of the royalty of that period. Its exquisite design and the high quality of workmanship would have done credit to a more contemporary product. There is also a range of jewellery, including necklaces and earrings that had once graced the queens and princesses of that era. Of particular interest are gold, silver, bronze and iron vessels recovered from Silla Dynasty tombs. A particularly rich haul has been from the tomb of King Huryeong of the Baekje period. This section of the museum has well over 7,500 carefully-selected artifacts of exceptional quality. The Medieval and Early Modern History Gallery has artifacts dating back to the Goryeo and Joseon dynasties. There is a very interesting section on Korea’s Hangeul alphabet, and the metal printing types to print documents in that language. In that respect, Korean culture had achieved considerable precedence over Europe. The exhibits include several ancient documents in Hangeul. The Dharani Sutra woodblock printing technique of an earlier age, is said to date back to rhe eighth century, and is claimed to be “the oldest existing woodblock printed scripture in the world”. All credit to Korean culture.A section on the Joseon period showcases massive wooden furniture. Interestingly, they had separate furniture for men and for women, in that day and age. The section on Asian art has the finest artifacts from India and Southeast Asia, Central Asia. China and Japan. Among the high-quality religious statues from India is an exceptional one of God Siva and his consort Parvati. In the Chinese section are a series of paintings laid out side by side. A closer look, however, shows the water flowing in the rivulet across all five paintings. Boats ply on the water, while a little bird flies across the paintings. These are very cleverly made movies. It is utterly brilliant.There is an awesome collection of Chinese porcelain obtained from the Sinan shipwreck. The ship was carrying exquisite pottery from China for use by Japanese temples, when it was wrecked.The section on porcelainware must be the envy of most other museums in the world. There is Buncheongware, celadon, as well as white porcelain. Particularly stunning is a celadon Ewer featuring a mythical creature with the body of a fish and the head of a dragon. This section also has audio-visual presentations on quality porcelain craftsmanship.Equally fascinating is the section on Buddhist art and sculpture. Buddhism came to Korea during the Three Kingdoms period. Some of the guilded metal statues of Buddha are of exceptional intricacy. The Pensive Bodhisattvas are regarded by Koreans as “national treasures”, and are products of exceptional craftsmanship. A large portrait of Buddha stretches from the floor to the ceiling. That section also has Buddhist metalware, Buncheongware and white porcelain.Among the most amazing exhibits in the museum is a ten-storey pagoda from the Gyeongcheonsa Temple site. It stretches almost from the ground floor to the roof of the museum, and is intricately carved from graniteDigital and audio guides are available on rental. These are in Korean, English, Chinese and Japanese. There are also programmes for visitors of all ages, from children onwards. There is a children’s museum that offers educational programmes for them. A library of reference works, museum shops that sell cultural products, restaurants, cafes, an 805-seat theatre for cultural programmes, free loan of strollers and wheel chairs for those who need them, as well as toilets, are among the facilities on offer. The museum’s permanent collections are free for visitors, while the special exhibitions are charged admission. Parking for visitors’ cars is also charged. The museum is closed on Mondays, 1 January and on all holidays. The visit was an emotionally rewarding experience. Hormuz P. Mama"
"Very big, but interesting","A good way to immerse in the cultural history of Korea. Very big, will take a lot of time. Grounds are also good to spend some peaceful time."
"the definitive, must-see Korean history museum",Bring your walking shoes and thinking caps because there's a lot to walk and see here in Ichon dong. They have exhibits on every period of Korean history from the Gogoryeo to the waning days of Joseon. A very great rainy day activity as well. The grounds are popular for people taking family photos as well.
Huge and full of history galore!,"I made the mistake of coming here on a Tuesday at first, which was a fail because I didn't realize that Monday was a holiday and they close on Mondays, but if Mondays are a holiday they close on the subsequent day. So the place was closed and we spent the time exploring the grounds instead, which was quite a lovely alternative as there were numerous gardens, a pond, and a couple of pagodas. So of course we came back the next day and proceeded to tour the museum. This place is HUGE, with 6+ floors of galleries filled to brim with historical information. I learned so much about calligraphy, marriage ceremonies, the different eras of Korea, etc. After a few hours and being only on the 3rd floor, we were starting to become tired and bored, so we decided to rest in this huge nice sunny room with couches everywhere before leaving. The museum is easily accessible from the subway (there's a stop right outside the grounds) and one of the exits takes you right up to the museum. Admission is free as well so definitely feel free to come on multiple days as it's hard to finish it in one, especially if you LOVE history or if it's rainy haha. For me, I'm not much of a history nut, so a few hours here was definitely sufficient for me."
Interesting but very big,The National Museum of Korea is huge. The exhibition is very interesting but you might get bored after a few hours spent in the museum. I would suggest to do the different exhibition in different days as the museum is free.
Very good summary and introduction to the history of Korea.,Travelled to the museum on a Sunday morning by taxi. The Museum has English notes on most of the items. The. Artefacts are very interesting and the knowledge Gai ed most rewarding. 
Best Managed National Museum,"The National Museum of Korea occupied vast piece of land and was very well constructed with impressive open-court before entering the museum. It's 4 levels with an atrium in the center gave an attractive welcoming perspective of the museum and also simplified the setup of the different halls. The treasures were well displayed and divided into different categories and with the assistance of the escalators, moving around the museum was relatively easy. There were clean toilets facilities in every floor. The lobby of the museum has a giant video board to announce any message the management would like to post. On our arrival from the cruise ship, the board displayed the welcome of our group."
Nice introduction to Korean history & culture,"The museum is free to enter and has a small recreational area around it to walk. This museum introducts you to the history & culture of the country, however, after visitng major world museums, i wasn't wowed. There were several interesting pieces but it turned out those weren't really Korean and were brought in either by Chinese or on Indian trading ships. They have a very good souvenir shop with some nice ceramics."
Worth a visit!,The museum was well maintained. They definitely keep it updated and is quite interactive. The displays were impressive. 
Blown Away!,"This museum is world-class and by far the most enormous and exquisite museum I ever been to. With the perfect surrounding of the green, this place offers knowledge and serenity for its visitors. It's amazing how such place amplify the locals and tourist with knowledge about the history of Korea through its heritage and culture. The cafe's range of food is amazing and tasteful and you can take so much photo of the garden. This is highly recommended and it's a regret for anyone not to come here."
"large museum, not too crowded","It is quite a walk from the nearby Ichon metro station. The museum is really too large for just one visit, so better take a leaflet and choose the items you want to see. The museum spans all of Koean history, from the Paleolithic onwards. I particularly liked the Buddhas on the third floor. Access is free. English explanations are rather limited. There are different museum shops, on on each floor, the main one is on the first floor. The is a nearby the National Hangeul Museum. Could not visit that one though."
Best for the knowledge lovers,I went there with my family. It was so great to see the pieces of Korean history. I did not have much time to see all of this this place but I had great time.
Excellent,"Really is a must visit. Spacious grounds and museum exhibits you'd be wandering around going wow, wow, wow."
Extremely large and spacious and well done,"This is a rather nice and super spacious museum near the center of Seoul. It is accessible by many buses and the Metro. I stress its size again because any shops and museums in Asia are so tiny and the walking area is so limited, that the space and freedom to walk around and enjoy the artifacts is so refreshing. Most exhibits have are in English in addition to the standard Korean. If there is a group of more than ten in English, there will be a guide to walk you around. If you are in Korea and looking for something to do, head down to the National Museum of Korea and it’s free!"
Worth the visit and it is free admission!,National Museum of Korea is a good place to visit if you are a visitor like me who spent a fortnight therel; the admission is for free and it holds exhibits from all over Asia and collections from private donors.
Worth a visit,nice surroundings - park - waterfall - views also suitable for kids(outside park) with playing grounds nearby. 
not much to see...,"it's a beautiful building and free to enter, which is very nice but honestly there's not much to see in there. occasionally they have exhibitions from other parts of the world. if you don't have time skip this one, especially if you have visited the likes of Forbidden City, Louvre museum, etc..."
Very nice exhibition,It is worthwhile to visit this museum. You will see the history of the former Korean Kingdom and the development of the people. Please visit the place next door as well. Admission is free of charge. You can have accupakket of coffee after the visit as well
History,"The museum is really huge and pretty. For people interested in history, this place is a mandatory point to visit. There are explanations in Korean and in English and there are tours available."
Amazing!,This place is so huge yet very organize! Each floor has this designated room for different era and you will not be confused! The main museum is for free but you have to pay for admission in all the Planned Exhibitions. 
"Visited 3 times, would have no problem with a 4th","Exhibits are varied and interesting. Information comes in many forms, from the display of artifacts to recreated examples of artifacts that you can touch and hold. Some small theaters show well created movies that give us animated examples of how structures were built, how material culture was crafted, and the history of prominent Korean figures and events. From time to time there are events and they are usually well advertised, and the museum seems to have multiple parts, such as an art exhibit on the west side of the building.Staff are helpful and you will have no trouble with English or Chinese, as well as Korean."
Amazing Experience,It's not only museum for korea but also have history of most of the asian countries. If you want to study Buddhism then there's a lot of things related to Buddhism.
Good place for visit,Korean National Museum is good place for visit for knowledge of Asia.You know much more about Asian history 
Another must; A great place to go on a rainy day or any day. Beautiful,Much to see here. You could easily spend a day enjoying this gem; from ancient times to modern day Korea. The building itself is part of the exhibit. It must be glorious when the flowers and gardens are in bloom
Great Museum to Visit,"Great day trip, the main area is free and well maintained. The last two exhibitions I saw there (Pompey and Buddha Styles) were excellent with a minimal entrance fee.I always recommend my students to visit the museum and the ones who do really have good time and learn a lot about Korea."
Cant miss this in Seoul,"Korea really does museums right. There are a staggering number of items on display at any one time, and most have interpretive displays in several languages. Admission is free although they happily accept donations."
Nice temporary exhibitions and also a great outdoor place,Likes the park with the view to Namsan Tower. A place where there is something to discover for everyone.
Lovely Museum!,"This was on our agenda as part of our last minute trip to Seoul and one of the best places to visit. Step back into history of the Korean history, very rich in culture as well. For all my korean drama loving friends, this would provide a good lineage and background on some of the dramas depicting the past.We took the free English tour, and we were brought through to almost 2 hours of very interesting facts and lessons, something which we might not have gathered if we had just walked around the museum. Our guide was a retiree, and his English was very easy to understand. It is amazing to see his passion as he brought us through.The main exhibition hall was free for the public to enter. Noted also that there was a children's museum and a special exhibition (paid) that probably changes depending on the theme. You would probably need 2-3 days to finish everything, otherwise just review the map and zoom in on the sections that interest you."
Nice museum,"This museum is huge and provides a lot of information. I wish more was in english, but we enjoyed it. You need a few hours or a couple days to get through all of it fully."
Very nice museum,Huge collection of artifacts from the past. You can easily spend many hours in the National Museum of Korea.
Stepping back into Korea's History,"The Korean National Museum should be one of your first stops in Seoul if you don't know much about Korea. Before you can understand where Korea's is going you need to understand where it came from. The museum is divide into two halves: A Korean history/culture side and side for imported exhibitions. Currently, Jan 2016, the Prince of Lichtenstein has loaned a number of Rueben's and his era artist. I believe this exhibitions runs through end of Feb 2016. You have to pay to see that exhibition.  The other side is the Korean history & culture Museum. This fits my entertainment budget - free. I found the museum to be very user friendly with English description at most pieces. They also have a audio available for those following a specific walking tour. I don't know how many languages are available though. I saw a number of children, Korean & non-Korean, with a what I believe is ""Where is Waldo"" book in an attempt to keep them interested and participate in the museum experience. The museum is organized by time span and the various kingdoms which governed this peninsula. There is a eatery and coffee shop in the musuem. The building architecture is very open and spacious. The ground around the build are well landscaped and offers plenty of place to sit to and enjoy your lunch.  Korean archaeology is still in its infancy. Remember they spent nearly half of the twentieth century under Japanese occupation, a bloody civil war, a number of dictators and finally a fledgling democracy starting in the 80's. Archaeology was not a primary focus. Additionally, one of the three kingdom of Korea Goryeo is located in North Korea and NW China. So there is a lot of history still to unearth. I give it a 4.5 out of 5. Easy to get to, free, and very interesting."
For real museum lovers.....unlike myself,"The building is beautiful, as is the outdoor area. However, I am not a true museum fan and not really my cup of tea. This is no Louve or MOMA....and unless there is something you really want to see at the exhibit and assuming your time is limited while visiting Seoul, I would pass. Of course, this is coming from a normally non-museum lover so please take this with a grain of salt."
Great Museum,"There a numerous museums in Seoul and this is a must see,great history and wonderful artifacts although not all of the information is in English.Free admission to main museum and there was a special exhibition while we were there on the history of Buddha which we paid a fee to enter and was worth it.Subway to Ichon Station Line 4 Exit 2 and museum is connected via a underpass."
Easy to navigate. Interesting,Easy to navigate and pretty interesting. We did a quick run through as we did not get the audio guides and there is limited information in English. There is much more info in Korean. Give yourself an hour and a half for a quick visit and of course longer if need.
Go if you're a history buff,"If you're a history buff, go for it! But get a tour guide to explain what do the structures mean and all. Like any palace musuem there is always an interesting story. I would definitely go again but with a tour guide. "
VERY GOOD IF YOU READ CHINESE,Been to Korea numerous times and never went to the National Museum so I decided to pay it a visit on a rainy afternoon. The signs are not very good but the historical documents inside are fascinating. Most of the old books / documents are written in traditional Chinese characters ( which I can understand ). There was a deed that a couple sold themselves into slavery and another document laid out the warranty on the building of a castle. A fantastic map in Chinese characters ( so call 'world map' ) drawn in Korea was mind blowing too.... 
Great museum,The building and setting are wonderful and the art inside has masterpiece after masterpiece beautifully displayed with full English language labeling.
So Much History!,"This is a great day trip...it is located right off the Subway exit with great directions. The view of the Namsan tower on the backside was nice. There is a cafe as well. There are lots of exhibits and a lot to see. It was a bit overwhelming, but it was neat to learn about Korean history. If I had more time I would have taken a guided tour."
Impressive collection and buildings. ,Very impressive building and a credit to the nation for erecting such a building to house the priceless history. English text is light and enough for a quick viewing of the displays. More detailed texts for people not familiar with Korean history or time periods would add to the experience and also enhance interest in Korean history. Only gave 3 stars as we attended on a Wednesday and visitors were light. No more audio guides were available. Also there are no coffee shops available inside the main exhibition areas and this is surprising due to the amount of coffee shops available elsewhere in Korea. 
Vast!,"The museum's architecture and gardens alone are worth the visit. Allow for at least 2 hours to see the Joseon period exhibits. Not worth renting an audio guide, since almost all of the exhibits have English explanations. This destination is on the Seoul City Tour bus Day Course route."
History,Visited this place to get to in depth understanding of the nation from the history point; interesting enough to understand the transformation of the nation and people perspective of living here...
Big and Beautiful,"My children, (15, 13 and 10), and I spent about 2 hours here. It could take 1/2 day to thoroughly viewing and reading everything. However, we've been to so many museums in Asia already, so we skipped many parts of this museums. We only viewed the Korean history. It's not only big and beautiful, but it's also free to the public. We enjoyed our 2 hours there."
"Grand museum, spend the day","a bit of a distance from other sites. Also a bit of a hike from the station, even though station is meant for museum. Simply beautiful grounds and really well done attraction. A place you should visit while in Seoul."
Good afternoon activity,"I really like coming to the National Museum. First, it's free to the public. That's totally awesome!It has many cultural and historical items worth seeing. Nearby is a park and small food shop which cheap food. I really recommend to come here.They finish building the underground walkway from metro to here. It's beautiful!"
BIGGEST MUSEUM IVE BEEN,"The place is so vast and if you're into history you should visit this place! You will learn not only about Korea but also other countries! I guess, this is one of the biggest museum in the world."
Very large museum.,"The museum entrance was free at the time of our visit which was an unexpected bonus. As the title suggests, it is a very large museum - allocate at least half a day to explore it in its entirety. You can see pretty much all of korean history there, chronologically organized on the bottom floor, topically on the second. Me and my husband had a great time, but we had only two hours which made for a hasty end to the visit. There is also a childrens room and exhibition inside the museum so you can also bring your kids there without fear of boredom. "
Amazing museum!,"There is loads to see in this museum, so much that I actually decided to take a full afternoon to see only the permanent exhibits session. The museum is easily accessible by subway. The permanent exhibit is full of interesting artefacts. The admission to the permanent exhibit is free of charge and there are audio guides available for a reasonable price. Definitely an amazing visit while in Seoul!"
great introduction to Korean culture,This is a great place to visit and should definiltely be included in any visitor's itinerary. The coolest thing is the exact replica of the Korean president's desk where you can get a photo of yourself there. There are tons of other exhibits there so allow time to see everything. 
Absolutely beautiful!! ,"The museum is HUGE and very impressive!! Don't be intimidated, there are so many 'resting areas' throughout the entire museum if you need to give your legs a break. English audio tour was good to have but there was no way we were listening to every piece. Covers all of korean ancient history and has multiple floors (arts, sculptures, private/donated collections on the upper floors). "
A good venue for a date or a day out with the family.,"Came here in autumn and it was really pretty! I'm sure it will be as pretty during the other seasons too. The museum grounds are massive, you could take a walk around the lake and take in the scenery before entering the building. Accessible by subway, and if I recall correctly admission is free. Lots of artifacts on the history of South Korea that dates back centuries. "
It's free so no worry to go for only a couple of exhibitions,"I like to go to museums. But I go always very directly for a part of the exhibition. I never try to do the whole museum in two hours or a day. I visited the buddha collection only, very inspiring and giving balance. After visiting and a special cup of tea in the museum I was satisfied. Next time another part of the exhibition. Go for the Buddha exhibition to learn about the differences between China/Korea and Japan."
Impressive building but can get dull ,"Visited with bad weather so cannot really say anything about the outside and park around it just that the building itself is very impressive and that alone is worth a view, next the entrance is free. The content on the first floor is worthwhile but going more to the top it really got more of the same and wasn't worth our time. If pressed for time visit the war museum instead this left much more of an impression on us. "
Another very good free museum in Seoul,"The National Museum of Korea is one of several large scale free attractions in Seoul that is worth spending a few hours, particularly if you are keen to learn about Korea's rich history. Opening Hours are 9am to 6pm (T,TH,F), 9am to 9pm (W,ST), 9am - 7pm (SN, holidays), closed on Mondays. The museum is divided into three floors, each requiring an hour or two to view properly, meaning you should plan on 3/4 of a day or more if you want to fully explore the entire museum. There are brochure maps in the lobby and the museum website does well to describe what you see in the various galleries. This is definitely worth some time prior to your visit if you want to plan out your visit. For those with limited time, you will probably want to focus on just one of the floors. If this is the case, we'd suggest the ground floor, which covers the history of Korea, stretching from the Paleolithic to more recent times. Here you will find many interesting displays and some particularly impressive artefacts, some of which are registered as national treasures in Korea. We particularly like the celadon collection, the silla gold items and the late 14th century Gyeongcheonsa Pagoda. Note that the galleries are modern and Items well-displayed throughout the museum, accompanied by sufficient but not overburdening text (Korean and English). A few video programmes are mixed in to help make the museum more accessible to younger visitors. To this end, there is an entire Children's Museum, near the Food Court, dedicated to presenting history in a hands-on way for younger visitors. Families visiting the museum will likely want to check this out. There are expected lockers, gift shop and several eateries including a decent food court on the ground floor with affordable meals as well a M Cafe on the second floor where you can take a break for coffee and ice-cream. Wifi service is available throughout the museum as well. Overall, we find the National Museum of Korea to be a very good free museum for residents and visitors to Seoul. It is a nice place to learn about the history of Korea as well as other areas of Asia if you have interest and time to do so. We will happily return for additional visits during future trips to Seoul."
Free Entrance to Moden National Museum,"Most subway is Line 4 Ichon. There is underpass linking the subway to about 100m away from the museum entrance, a nice thought for rainy or snowy days. The museum has three floors and many sits for you to rest (it is very big) and free drinking water at each corners. Korean history on Level 1. History of its links to Japan and China in Level 3."
Interesting and Educational,Interesting for one who is learning about some of Koreas history. Was a little confused at some parts as it felt that other asian countries such as Japan made more of an appearance that Korean history. There was drinking water everywhere which was nice when taking a short break from viewing beautiful items.
Why it is FREE. it should 10USD. ,"It has all Korean history. Lots of National Treasure. But entrance is free as of Nov 1st, 2015. The entrance should be at least 10USD. If you are interested in Korean buddhism, history from prehistoric era, this place will be perfect. You will need one hole day. At least half day. :) "
little bit of everything,"If it is rainy day or even beautiful on, it worth it, because park near museum is beautiful. Museum itself is very vivid. Typical stuff like ceramics, arts, caligraphy, buddhas, war equipment etc."
History and traditions,This is one of the biggest museum of Korea. It is needed at least 4 hours at minimal to have a good view of all exibitions. You can find very important aspects of Korean History. 
something for everyone,There are free tours for this so I highly recommend to get a feel and view of this place. Its really peaceful in the grounds and museum and you feel like you could take your time - there are various attractions ie picnic area etc that you could visit. The childrens museum is next to this but restricted to 300 visitors so would suit young ones.Also if you get to the top of teh stairs (check pics) you get a really good photo shot of seoul (exercise and photo opportunity). This place is spacious - when we visited there were cultural dancing in front of the main steps outside. There are toilets on every floor (always a plus) and also a library. The cafe is expensive but there are books inside that you can read whilst sipping tea. There is a library and a lake which is peaceful - also a picnic area where there were some massive marrow /cucumber hanging from the branches. YOu coudl bring your own food here and it was good to see children making teh most of this. It suits family and young ones as there is a lot of spaces/activities to explore.
Smart way of exposition ,It's rare to be impressed by the exposition of Stone Age objects and it is only first hall of this collection of historical miracles. The creators of the exposition prove that all the objects here are honorable treasures. They prove that they love the history and want the visitors to be involved in this exciting journey through the time.Really worth be seen. It is even sad that it is free of charge.
If you love museum,Check this out. This place has many floors. A lot of stairs but there are escalators too. It aslo has a cool tea house. Try the chestnut drink. Also thus museum had a garden.My favorite floor was the bottom where there is a big budda.
Lovely place to visit,"Was taken during my business trip to Korea, very interesting indeed, well worth a visit if you happen to be in the local area "
Check it out!,It was a sunny day and warm. Also field trip for the elementary age kids. They waved Hi for my camera :) Great history on Korea. 
Worthy of a vidit,"The Koreans are very well known for their Love of country & this National Museum is a proud testament to that. A huge infrastructure, a well curated collection I can spend a whole day just walking through the collections. A nice museum cafe & huge museum store awaits your visit. I just love museum stores. "
"Impressive building, average content","The museum itself is gorgeous and well maintained. Beautiful building and impressive technology and overall look. We weren't as impressed with the content inside however. Although there is a wide variety, there wasn't so much historical context provided and we felt we didn't really learn enough. The main floor was far better than the 2nd or 3rd. There was also quite a bit of information in Korean, but there seemed to be lacking some in English.An ok trip, but I wouldn't recommend it if you're pressed for time. I enjoyed the war memorial much more. "
Huge museum- recommend the english audio guide,Went here on a rainy day to kill time. Some interesting and educational exhibits. Bring along your passport as deposit for the audio guide which can be rented cheaply (think it was 1000 won).
Great museum with the full history of Korea ,"Loved the museum, a very large building with tons of space, felt like the exhibitions were a bit exclusive, very clean and nice. Also visited temporary Buddhist exhibition near the museum which was awesome. Do recommend! "
The museum to visit when in Seoul,I spent about three hours here and saw all three floors. Take metro line 4 in direction of Oido and get off the Ichon stop exit 2. There is an underground path that takes you directly to the museum. Once above ground the museum is right in front of you. It's free! Plenty of seating throughout the visit so you can rest in between exhibits. 
National Museum of South Korea ,"I went to here next week and there's a nice museum.Many exhibits in a modern building with many children and their parents.If you are hungry you also can have lunch here just more expensive than outside .And I also met a couple on a bunch to a picture from India,really art date.And near the outside,there's a park that's a family park exactly.If you want you can go picnic with your family members."
Nice visit. Must do.,2nd time I visit the museum. And of course there is always something new to see.It's covering all the history of Korea from prehistorical to new ages.Best museum for long time. 
Impressive museum,The museum is so large and the exhibits so informative we couldn't see everything in four hours. We will definitely come back to the museum.
Well worth a visit,The building itself is worth seeing. Built in the old USArmy base it is just a wonderful space to have a break from the bussel of Seoul. We were there for three hours and only saw 1/4 of the displays.
Beautiful place for a walk,I get here using the hop on hop off bus.I didn't enter due to I didn't have enough time but I walk into the park and a lot of korean people goes on weekend. 
Nice but not impressive ,Free entry and very nice and relax area. The museum is vast but not very impressive. If you want to understand little bit more about Korea ancient history it's a good place to start but in the end you'll seen a lots of ceramic stuff. The most interesting part is the Buddhist part
Excrement tour,A good overview of the Korean way of life and how the culture evolved over the centuries. This is a free tour and was a great museum to visit while at the palace.
nice place,"well designed, easy to get around, airy and spacious with exhibits well displayed. easy to get to on public transport."
Great history,I found this to be very interesting. It is a very large museum and it's beautiful. Learned things I didn't know about the Korean culture. If you enjoy history this is a must.
Magnificent and beautiful,The national museum is a magnificent edifice with a lot of history about South Korea. There is easy access to the museum and you only need a ticket if you want to visit specific rooms
Insightful,If you are history buff like me and always tend to visit National Museums in every country you visit. This is exactly for you. A great journey though Korean history in this multilevel modern and beautifully designed building. I joined a group of travellers in the english tour which took us through the highlights of the Museum. The tour guide was very knowledgable and answered question of the group and very helpful. Try the tea in the Koren tea house on the top level which overlooks a nice garden and views Itaewon.
its a must visit place in South Korea,"its a magnificent museum. i spend half day there, but still not enough. it have 4 floor. just enter the 1st floor and i lost in time.its worth to spend the whole day there. i want to go back there again.need to wear a comfort shoes there, its sooooo huge.bring also a good camera, but dont turn on the flash. dont bring water there, they have in each floor the free drinking water.they even have a restaurants at the 1st floor, from korean-japanese-chinese to western food to choose.i just need to enjoy the history of south Korea."
Beautiful museum,"Definitely worth going. Plan to spend an entire day there because there is a lot to see. You can also have lunch there. Beautiful exhibits. Watch out for hundreds of school children...all well behaved, though."
Fantastic glimpse into Korean history,"Ticks all the boxes you would expect from a national museum, with a huge variety of items and excellent signs that follow chronologically to give you a great look into the history of this fascinating country. The building itself is very modern and has an elegant setting. You can easily spend half a day in here."
Great visit,We got there early in the day and spent many hours exploring the beautiful building. We learnt a lot about Korean and Asian history. We visited the restaurant over looking the lake and had an amazing meal. The grounds surrounding it are very pretty . It is well worth a visit. 
A good way to spend the day,"This museum is a great way to learn about ancient Korea and how it has changed over the years. There are tours available for foreigners, although you can opt to have a listening device if your tour is over for the day. It is a good way to spend a rainy day. "
Interesting Architecture and Excellent Exhibits,"This museum is a ""don't miss"" on your itinerary. First, this modern building has a very interesting design. Of course, it's the exhibits that count. I spent most of my time in the extended gallery that displayed artifacts from the paleolithic to bronze age. It was so clearly laid out and seeing the progression in man's skills and art over that period was fascinating. The best exhibit of its kind that I have ever seen. The explanations in English were very good, but it is still worth paying for the headphones as the explanations were more fulsome."
should go at least one.,i like museum and art. i spend my time at musical this time .there are hangul museum on the right side. 
National Museum of Korea,"This is truly one of the great national museums of the world. It covers the entirety of Korean history, plus has exhibits from China, Japan, India, Central & Southeast Asia, a large gallery of donated items including an ancient Greek bronze helmet, a gallery of items retrieved from the Sinan Shipwreck, stone and porcelain galleries, and a gallery of metalwork and Buddhist sculpture. There is a park of large stone sculptures outside. The highlight of the museum is probably the four Silla gold crowns displayed in several different galleries. While it normally takes me almost a full day to photograph a Chinese provincial museum for my Chinese and World History website, I spent two full days photographing this museum. It is the single best historic attraction in Korea and one of the best in all Asia."
A great cross section of Korean/Asian history,"Museums are all too frequently set aside for rainy/crappy days but this is worthy of a visit, regardless of the weather.To access it, take the #4 line in the direction of Oido and get off at the Ichon stop. Follow the signs underground for the museum and you will eventually exit the metro at the base of the museum grounds.For a museum dedicated to history, the building is ironically very futuristic and “art nouveau-ish”. It is laid out over 3 floors, with each floor having a theme. The first floor, which I found the most engaging, was dedicated to the history of man on the Korean peninsula, from the Paleolithic period through to the 2nd millennium. It was amazing to see the slow, natural progression from the first, crude stone tools used tens of thousands of years ago all the way to the use of highly decorative jewelry, pottery, weapons and such some one hundred twenty years ago.The other floors are dedicated to paintings, calligraphy and sculpture. It’s really only the third floor which decidedly fans out from Korea to include a section of Asian art from the entire continent.The museum is free and closed on Monday."
A must if you love arts,"The museum is huge and has an impressive collection of exhibits on display. As reference, I spent about 5 hours here for the guided tour, took lunch in the food court (located behind the gift shop) and lost myself in the calligraphy and Buddhists sections.This museum is awesome!"
Nice collection in an extraordinary building,"The building and the park impressed me the most even if they have an impressive collections of various aspects of the history. Artifacts shown gives a good exposure to all of the Korean peninsula's history from the days humans first the feet on the ground to the present date. Well, at least until 1950s. A pity too many explanations of the artifacts shown where in Korean only. With more info in English I'm sure I would have appreciated it more."
I go there to take a walk.,"Korea, Museum and Strolling.If you like more than two above, you definitely want to visit. Take a blue line(4) subway and take off at I-chon Station."
Visit this first,"i'm sure if i had visited this museum first, i would had enjoyed but seeing as i had visited the Gyeonbukgung museum, i had already an heard a lot about the main exhibit. there's a really awesome small scale 3D map of Seoul and you get to walk over it, it's just fantastic. there's various small scale models of old korean neighborhoods, it's just fatastic"
Not to be missed,"Not to be missed. A beautiful, wonderful museum. And so well done. Learned a tremendous amount about Korean history and was so impressed by the architecture of the building and the park setting around."
Excellent Museum,"We enjoyed touring the National Museum of Korea. What was particularity facilitating to me where the Korean treasures such as the Silla gold crown and the Celedon porcelain. We learned a lot about Korean history, culture and arts at the museum."
Great Museum Near the Palace,Really like this museum. It is an easy walk from the palace if you are trying to do all the touristy things at the same time. The museum works its way through a lot of Korean history in a fun way. We spent a few hours in there as there is so much to read and see. The museum isn't so big you don't know where to go and a guide might be useful but we found it was great regardless. 
Excellent English tour,"I showed up for the 11 AM English guided tour. There were about a dozen of us. Our tour guide spoke English very well and was very passionate in his tour. He started off with about a 15 minute overview of the Korean history going back thousands of years.I thought the most interesting portion of his lecture was his explanation of the Korean alphabet. Obviously he only had enough time, 1 1/2 hours, to hit on the highlights of the museum. The museum is enormous. But his tour was excellent. I would highly recommend."
Worth a visit,"Beautiful building and well laid out. Progresses chronologically through the history of Korea. The descriptions are a bit repetitive, and would have been nice to have more details . More artefacts, art, sculpture, and diversity would have been nice, but I had feeling much of what should be in this museum is in China and Japan. Many school classes visit this place, so rooms can get crowded, but not for long. There is small cafeteria tucked half way between the 1st and 2nd floor, good view and worth visit."
A wonderful surprise!,"My first impression was - WOW! What a huge place, SPACE! Have been living in HK for a year where space is premium, to see and be in this vast place, I was overwhelmed! And to be treated to a surprised open-air traditional concert was a welcome bonus. We quickly walked round one exhibition area (had to get back onto the tour bus). There was a food court where the price is reasonable and the food are delicious. I highly recommend visitors to visit this place."
world-class museum,"This is a beautiful, excellent museum. Collections are beautifully displayed, the architecture is spectacular. Plan to spend a least half a day, there is so much to see. The restaurant is also excellent with a surprising range of offerings, even really good for kids. Check out the other organizations right there, too, and walk the grounds. Wonderful store with a tremendous range of merchandise, offered at a range of prices."
Very informative musuem,"I have always love visiting musuems overseas to learn more about the history of the country so this place gets a thumbs up fr me!!! Wished I had more time to spend here, will definitely return again when I am in Korea!"
An excellent museum,"The museum is worth visiting alone for the building its in - its a very impressive, big modern building - both from outside and inside. Visiting is free, and if you have any interest in the history, culture and buddishm in Korea, you should definitely come here.The only big dissapointement for me: I would have loved to get an audio guide. But I didnt have my passport with me, and you need it as a deposit. I offered to leave a money deposit (like I did at Gyeongbokgung), but that was not possible unfortunately. Too bad, as with commentaries you learn so much more about the exhibits.If you are there during lunch time, there is a food court to the west of the entrance. You can get tasty and cheap food there, and its full of locals. There are several stalls, but you order at the ""main desk"", pay there, get a beeper and then collect your food from the stall."
Not just Korean art,"Plan to spend at least half a day at the museum. Lots of interesting art, religious artifacts, and historical info."
"Impressive architecture, nice museum",It was nice to have a look into korean history. It is easy to spend there hours. Depends (as always) from the degree of interest.
History,The museum provided us with a glimpse of the history of Korea and the way people lived before and after the division of the two Koreas. It gave us the simplicity of their alphabet and language as well as their crafts.
museum,The museum is worth visiting. I lIked the architecture of the museum and the exhibitions too. I could have stayed a total day.
Excellent museum,"We had a great visit to the museum. We went on the English language tour and were the only people on it, so we basically had a free private tour. Our guide was really helpful and was genuinely passionate about educating people about Korean history."
War Craft,"Hope this should be the same as War Memorial National Museum. Nice, with inside and outside museum. The Garden was nice here as well. The Brothers hugging status its a reminder that war hurts us all. "
Must visit - AND FREE!!!,Lovely that the museum is free to visit! A lovely 3 level museum featuring very interesting artifacts. The whole trip took me more than 2 hours because I enjoyed reading everything that was written on the exhibits (descriptions are in English as well!).
Interesting,"This is a small museum but very interesting, it's free to enter which is nice and very spacious & well laid out, the displays are a little minimal but enough to keep you interested. My husband and I both enjoyed the overlook of the city exhibit, quite amazing how they have done this. On the subway its line 5 (purple) to Seodaemun exit 4"
Great Museum,I always enjoy visiting museums and this one is no exception. There are many halls exhibiting artefacts from the ancient past of Korea however I found it to get a little repetitive after a little while. That being said I would absolutely recommend anyone to visit here if they visit Seoul
Loved it <3,"As a Mexican, it was pretty surprising and amazing to get to know Korean culture. For me, it was quite an experience to learn about Korean history in such an amazing place. The walls of the National Museum of Korea shelter centuries of wisdom and magnificent historical pieces."
this is great museum ,we went this museum no planwas so good Was so big than expectedi feel like i need to know my cultureAnd this is so helpful to me to know my culture was too big so maybe i need to visit here again later 
Museum visit,"Free entry and easy access via subway. Really beautiful building and gardens, extensive displays. Korea has worked hard at uncovering and displaying is very rich history and culture. The audio guides are helpful. The museum is very large, take your time. On Wednesdays it's open till 10pm "
The National Museum of Korea,"When I first arrived at the museum by foot, it was huge in my opinion. There is free admission to view the exhibit, but there is also exhibits that you can pay to see. There is lots of space outside as well. Really clean building. Depending on the day that you go, it can be busy or empty."
A lot to look at,Quite good - very big so you will need to allocate a few hours if you want to get around the whole place.
Enjoyable museum,"This is a big museum. However I just visited the Korean season and the important life events. The life events were really illuminating. Thoroughly enjoyed the displays and the information. Gave me an insight into their life. I was restricted in time at the museum, I wish that I had had more time to enjoy it."
Museum,Free admission Easy to get to with metro Lovely outside spaces. Bring a picnic Beautiful calm space inside very well laid out and while not all in English there was more than enough for us to understand The 9th most visited museum in the world  Well worth bidit
Korea's Smithsonian,It was very interesting viewing history from another part of the world. Plan on spending quite a bit of time here. 
Museum of Treasures and it's free,Fabulous museum. Be prepared to spend a significant amount of time in this highly educational museum of all facets of Korean history. Great collection of celadon; engaging and educational with English translation. Made aware of significant scientific and geographical inventions made by Koreans that paralleled or predated similar Western inventions.
A must for lovers of Asian art,An amazing home for a huge collection. Of special interest is the Chinese treasure ship wreck recovery. Ceramic collection is (predictably) especially strong and beautifully exhibited. Next time we'll try the restaurant -- it looked great.
"The Museum is a Beautiful Building on a Beautiful Plot, BUT...","Of all the museums I've been to, I recall most having witnessed some masterpieces that ppl read about in books. The piece are what defines a museum for me and in all honesty (I'm trying to say this as nicely as I can...) I wasn't impressed. There were a few pieces that caught my fancy...some of the crowns and prints, but there were too many 'unimpressive' items on display. I stopped counting the number of plates they had on display at...50. I was most impressed with the actual museum because it is so huge and elaborate. That one sitting Buddha was cool too because he had so much character."
Worth a trip for history buffs/ curious travelors,"So you know nothing of the history of Korea? Well don't feel left out, few do outside the peninsula. Although it's not as exciting as Japanese Shoguns and Samurai, or Chinese walls to keep out Mongolian invaders, Korean history has its sparkle as well. The museum is vast and well-kept. It's practically free considering the prices of museums in Europe and America. There are gardens at the back of the building that are beautiful and quite peaceful."
Well worth the visit,"This may be a free museum but it's not lacking in exhibits. There is so much to see here that during our year long stay in Korea we visited almost half a dozen times.This museum has more than it's fair share of Korean National Treasures which are well worth the visit alone,.The grounds are nice for a gentle stroll around if you start to get overwhelmed by the exhibits.This museum also hosts special exhibits at different points of the year, some of these charge but the ones we went to were worth the charge."
Free Museum,"This museum is free!! But they do have a lot of materials. Also, the explanation is really good, well-organized, and English friendly. You can check out the history of Korea briefly, and look around Korean Tradition, too."
i like museum,"this is big museum and inside gwanghamun palace. I am lucky as I visited here on 16 august - Korea celebrating independence day, so admission fee was also free."
Fascinating and Free,"This is a very nice (and FREE) museum with a good collection of art and historical artifacts. I spent most of my time on the first floor, which takes you (counterclockwise from the entrance) on a complete tour of Korean history through the imperial period. I had read Bruce Cumings Korea's Place in the Sun before arriving, which is a history of Korea in the 20th century, so he breezes right through the preceding millennia. This museum was excellent for helping me flesh that out in my mind. "
My favorite museum,"This museum has great history and art. The main hall is free, and there is a great mix of written explanation, as well as media presentations. "
Really high tech and interactive,"Probably one of the most interactive museums I've been too in a while. A lot of the displays allowed you to pick things to listen to. They had a water feature/art feature in one of the rooms as well. It was a really pretty place to be, especially on a nice spring day. I would definitely recommend."
Greaf family activity as well as educational,"Like any museums it's very educationalLots of peoplecons.. some tourists should control their children better, a museum is not a play ground to run around and scream."
Good way to spend your day,If you're wishing to know more about the history of Korea and see some beautiful artifacts I highly recommend a trip to this museum. Many proud Koreans have donated their collections of artifacts to this museum. 
Food court at the museum,"Free national museum in Seoul. Very nice with lots of Korean history stuff. Celadon in 3rd floor and first floor, 3 kingdoms hall are great. After looking around the museum, went to the foodcourt which is next to the museum shop. I did not have a expectaion for this food court but it is better than I expected. I quite liked simple plate, Port curtlet. The Museum shop has also many miniature products. Very beautiful."
A little boring,"For me it's a little boring compared to the war memorial. There are a lot of artifacts and things displaying there, but the description are all in Korean, perhaps with a line stating what it is in English. So, i failed to understand and chose to leave early."
Vast and informative,"The National Museum is a vast place. As with other very large museums, like say the Met in New York, it's easy to exhaust yourself. I highly recommend choosing a few areas of interest, whether it's ceramics, calligraphy, Buddhist art, furniture, or whatever, and just visiting those targeted areas. The gift shop is nice and has some high-guality items on offer. I can say from experience that the restaurant at the far end serves very nice desserts. In addition, the grounds are lovely and worth exploring if the weather is not too hot or too cold."
Average museum,"Average Museum in comparison with the World Museums but still it is worth visiting.Korean, Japanese & Indian (also other Asian) art & historical item are displayed in 3 stories. It is free admission and they have English tours but we were late for one so we explore it all by ourselves. It is nice & clean & air-conditioned inside, there are benches to get some rest. It is easy to find, from the metro station there are metals plates on the ground leading all way down to the Museum entrance."
Interesting ,If you need anything to get interesting overview of Korean history check out the museum it's free admission and it's a very nice display of intricate Korean artifacts and history check it out I loved it
Biggest museum in Korea!...i think...,This place is massive! I was not as impressed as I was at the War Memorial but this museum is still impressive. This museum will give you everything a little bit of everything about Korea. From skeletons to potteries to buildings to monuments and everything in between. 
"It is huge, free and the headset is useful","Compared to the one in Taiwan, I enjoyed this museum better. Perhaps because it is free and layout is very organized. they provide headset which has all informative information. It was enjoyable two hour walk. "
Great museum!,I loved how the museum was laid out! It took you through Korean history through objects and art work. The videos in between made it feel a little interactive and allowed some rest too. We went on a Sunday afternoon and found it quite empty!
A quick overview of Korean history.,"I spent a couple hours with my dad, especially on the 2nd floor. He is a lover of Chinese calligraphy, so he was in heaven. Don't miss the golden crowns of Silla on 1st floor and the Goryeo era pagoda."
Interesting and Educational,Beautiful and spacious Museum with very interesting artifacts.We had an English guide to help explain history of Korea. Everyone should visit to learn to history of this beautiful country.
Korea's largest museum is really worth a visit,"The National Museum of Korea is the largest museum in the country and definitely worth seeing, even if there's a lot of similar stuff I had already seen at other museums, including the National Palace Museum at Gyeongbokkung as well as the National Museum in Gyeonju; this one is the biggest and has the most comprehensive sweep of Korean history and culture. It's large, but you can probably do the museum in around two hours, not including special exhibitions. And you can get there by subway, even if it's a bit of a walk (around 15-20 minutes) from the nearest station. I do think the exterior of the building could be so much more interesting; it just looks like a big shoebox. And the galleries named for major donors are a bit off-putting in terms of flattering their vanity. But this museum is definitely worth a visit if you can get there. Note: it's wheelchair-accessible once you get inside the museum, but you have to climb a long incline to get up to the entrance. In any case, make sure to see the giant pagoda in the middle of the museum~!"
Too bad for me,The I'm sure otherwise excellent staff placed me in a wonderful fully guided tour... in Chinese... no English was available at the time. Sooooo boring when you don't understand...I just left.
Boring,"I'm a museum lover but this place bored and disappointed me. Don't get me wrong it is a very nice and huge museum but by the time I visited I had already been to these museums: Royal Palace, Folk and War Memorial. So I felt like I had already seen a lot of the things at this place. The reason I was disappointed was because a lot of things were marked as replicas (I find this a common occurrence at all the museums I've been to in Korea) and when I go to museums I want to see the real thing, not a replica.So even though I was bored I can't really say ""don't go here"" because after all it's free!"
Excellent Museum,"I highly recommend this museum, it is organized in a great way that takes you through the history of the Korean Land and it's people. Very good exhibits with plenty of English descriptions and dialogue. I went midweek and it was not at all crowded, I'm sure the weekends are much busier. A must see for museum lovers while in Seoul."
Korean History to be Displayed,"Go to Ichon subway station. Follow the direction to National Museum of Korea. Go to the building on your right which is the correct museum; the left museum was for art exhibition and it is not free; the National Museum is FREE!! If you need to pay some fee means you are in the wrong side. Free wi-fi available. The place is neat, tidy and well maintained; the display was very well adjusted with descriptions, yap they provide English as well. It is quite interesting but I think this place suits historian better."
Intresting,"It is AWESOME, if you want history BOOM you got it. The Food is okay... I guess. But for history lovers it is going to be awesome."
Good time,"If you're interested in knowing the history and legacy of Korea its a good place for you. You will find chinese, japanese and korea statues and artfacts. 3 hours would be more than enough to explore the place. "
Beautiful Museum and grounds.,"A world class Museum where you can easily spend an entire day. Many of the exhibits have descriptions in English and also a marker indicating if they are a national Treasure.The building itself is impressive and the grounds are quite beautiful, especially in the Spring.Well worth a visit."
It's free!,This place is free and it is huge. If you are into Korean history it is a great place to visit. The downside is that like most museums in Korea they all have the same stuff generally. If you've gone to one you've gone to them all. So if you need to just visit one historical museum this one is a good bet. The building and surrounding area is also worth a look. You get a great view of Seoul Tower from here also.
Huge museum to learn Korean history,"There is so much to see that you could easily spend the full day. You can learn all about the history of Korea, and the museum is very well maintained. I found it to be very clean and well organized."
"Excellent, So glad we visited this museum","I learnt so much of Korea's history from this museum. Everything is extremely easy to follow, the exhibits were amazing. It is also such a beautiful building. We had been there 2 hours and if had absolutely flown by. You should allow at least 1/2 day for a visit."
Much to see not much to learn,"the museum is epic, one of the largest in the world. the only thing that I found some what annoying was that I did not understand the full scope of the pieces on display. The english part has only the title while you can see the Korean section is saying way more.Other than it is a pretty cool place to visit especially if the weather is bad or your plans got cancelled or if you're broke since its free!"
One of the best in the world,"The National Museum of Korea is a shiny new building in beautifully landscaped grounds and is one of the greatest national museums you can visit anywhere. Its permanent exhibition is absolutely massive and covers just about everything to ever happen in Korea, from the invention of stone tools to the 1870s and the beginning of modernization. Each gallery has excellent English descriptions, but many of the artifacts are stunning and speak for themselves. The glorious Silla dynasty crown is by far the must-see item of the collection, although there are countless statues, pieces of jewelry, tools, household items and other treasures which bring the fascinating history of this country to life. As someone who is usually not interested in Asian history and art, I was pleasantly surprised by how interested I became during the many hours I spent here. The upper floors are dedicated to themed displays, such as Buddhist painting or items from Japan or Central Asia, but I chose not to spend much time there as the Korean history sections were overwhelming in their content and quality. The National Museum was undoubtedly a highlight of my trip to Seoul and I wholeheartedly recommend it to everyone!"
More than expected,It was a good chance for me to find out more about Korean culture.I love Korea and this trip more cool than I expected.
A wonderful collection in a stunning building,"While the collection at this museum is fantastic and offers a great overview of Korean history, the building is equally impressive and a lovely place to spend a few hours. Even the cafeteria is attractive and the food is pretty good. The museum, especially the first floor, is laid out very well and walks visitors through Korean history - explaining the Dynasties and highlighting important events and leaders. The collection of artifacts is impressive - my kids particularly enjoyed seeing the various types of ancient money.If you have children, be sure to check out the attached Children's Museum as well (reservations may be required here)."
How a National Museum Should be.,"An excellent collection of Korean artifacts which are well laid out and displayed. A visit here will give you an appreciation of the depth of Korean history, and it is free. You can wander around the extensive grounds and gardens outside and then continue your journey through the modern galleries within. There is also a nice tea shop and good casual restaurant in the complex,"
Amazing depth of history,"This is an exceptional facility, with a very wide array of exhibits. Korea is a very ancient land and this museum really helps you appreciate that. It is well laid out and multiple languages."
Great place to go on a rainy day,"Be warned it is closed on Mondays. The National Museum is free and has a lot of beautiful artwork and artifacts. If you are interested in Korean culture I would definitley go here. If it is not raining I would take time to walk around the park in front of it. If you have time and are studying Korean, the hangul museum is really interesting. It has exhibits on the creation of the hangul characters."
Excellent,Excellent museum with Free admission. The exhibits are pretty comprehensive. good in learning their history.
Crash course in Korean culture and history,"I love museums. It's one way to learn about foreign cultures in a short period of time. I got to appreciate Korean history and culture via this museum. I mean it's not just about K-Pop right? (Of which I am not so familiar, to begin with)"
Big but pretty standard,"The place was large and had quite a lot of things shown, however most of it felt like they sort of just placed it behind glass and gave it a description. No real storyline or interaction on the exhibits. Felt pretty average too me."
The museum is cute,"If you love history like I do, you will love this place, you will be able to see the development of the Korean culture. from the cave tims to the futuristic present they are now. "
Huge and nicely built,"The place is just off the Ichon train station. There is an underground path from the station to the Museum entrance, so look for the signs. The museum ground is huge. From the outside it beats any of the palaces in grandeur and scale. A huge lake is in front, and the back is the Namsan tower. There are plenty of displays about Korean history. There's even a nearby museum for the Korean language. Inside are good cafes and restaurants. So anyone can easily spend a whole day here, if you are ok with the peace and quiet. I was there on a weekday."
Great museum for pottery!,"A nice, spacious museum. Wonderful Celadon and other style pottery! The collection of ancient Asian pottery and artifacts recently recovered from a sunken ship is especially interesting. "
Korea heritage,"Make sure to take a half-day for it. Huge, neat, well-organized, loaded with very interesting objects of Korean heritage. We were especially by the well-preserved neolithic skeleton and the big Buddha carvings. Great audiovisuals too. Close to subway station, there is one exit that gets you directly there."
If you only~,"Most travelers will only visit one museum, one place, one~~~ well, if you really only have time to go to one, I would go to this one! It is huge! There is a lot to see, and the English guide was very helpful. The temporary exhibit is always changing, so I try to go every few months. It is a great place to explore and learn about Korean history. "
Very Dry,"Visually, this museum is beautiful and impressive, but I would not bother going unless you are interested in Korean history presented in a very traditional way. Items under glass with labels giving some very dry information on them. Very formal and cold. Definitely not for children but probably better for adults with more background in ancient Korean history who can appreciate the items on display."
I can be here all day,"Very easy to go, just get off at Ichon station and follow the sign. There're so many things to see, I wish I have more time. "
Time to spare ?,"Decided to go to the museum on the night it was open until 8pm. No other people to be seen ! For a free musuem, you can't go wrong. Lots of interesting things to see at your own pace. Great view of N Tower too. "
Overrated,Very nice building and surroundings but the exhibition is very ordinary. Nothing really spectacular. If you have limited time you can skip it.
historical!:),we had a great time when we visited the national museum of korea there are lots of galleries where each has it's own theme . the museum itself is informative and you will learn a lot .
National Museum of Korea,"An acceptable attraction if you have a couple of hours to spare. The museum is free and easy to get to (it has it's own subway station) however I wouldn't put it at the top of my hit list if I was back in Seoul. The displays are interesting up until a certain point but there is very little variation in what you see. I saw a lot of pottery and weaponry but nothing interactive. However, the 12 story Pagoda in the center of the hall is worth seeing. "
#1 must do in Seoul!,"Great museum! Apart from being free (!), the museum is a must-do in Seoul. The ground floor compromises the whole history of Korea beautifully explain from pre-history to the modern era. You do not get the chance to learn much about Korea in the Western world so what this museum offers is quite unique. "
Don't miss this fine museum,A very nice museum with an extensive collection of artifacts from Korean culture. A full day or more to see it all. 
Boring,Quite boring as the exhibits are quite limited. We spent about 1 hours and felt bored and decided to leave. The plus is that it is free.
Excellent guide,The English guide I had (free) was very good. The museum has a good overview of Korean art and the guide was able to explain the historical and political significance of the pieces we saw.
Rather dry,"Lots of beautiful artefacts, but they're not really presented in an engaging way. If you have been to museums elsewhere in Korea you'll probably see much of the same things."
Pleasant half-day,"The museum is spacious on impressive grounds. There are interesting Korean/Asian artifacts from various areas (recovered from a shipwreck, large Buddha related sculptures, etc.). Our audioguides did not work well, but did not seem to be particularly informative when they did work."
Culture and History,"I enjoyed the visit, however not long enough. There is so much to learn about the history of Korea here. The grounds around are well maintained and a nice walk around. "
See the best of Korean traditional art,This is a must stop for all tourists to understand Korean art in the context of Asian art. Many of the national treasures are on display. The temporary exhibits vary and are well worth it. The cafeteria is a reasonable place to eat and the gift shop offers high quality gifts to take home
A let down,"The building is enormous and ugly and the collection on display is rather disappointing and small for such a huge space (perhaps 5 to 6 times larger than the British Museum but less that 10% of stuff displayed there). Too much space for so little stuff, unless of course you are info Korean history (there is a large section of the rest of Asia that does not follow any historical or geographical logic). It has a lovely collection of Korean ceramics. In fact, this is the only think I enjoyed. For other stuff of Korean royal history best to head to the Nationl Palace Museum, which is elegant, intimate and superb."
Place to discover history of Korean,"Very large campus. I was there when they had a wing set aside for a special display on the Korean War. If you are a military buff, you HAVE to visit this museum. Armored vehicles, choppers and planes on display outside. Even the entrance to the property with huge statues dedicated to the war will keep you for 10 minutes snapping photos. I intend to go back again."
An outstanding museum experience,"There are hour long tours of the highlights in English at 10, 11 and 1400 which give you a good orientation. I bought the museum book which helped me to choose the top sights. Don't forget to look at the the building itself and to walk around the grounds, there is a pagoda garden, a small stream and waterfall and lovely trees."
Magnificent building and artefacts,"A National Museum is a national showcase, and gives a country the chance to really show itself off. The South Koreans have really embraced the opportunity here, with a massive, imposing structure surrounded by a lake and manicured gardens, with an air conditioned automatic walkway from the nearest subway station.The interior is no less impressive, as is the collection of artefacts. You could spend a whole day in here, without question. We took a guided tour, which was provided free and hosted by a volunteer. ""John"", our guide, was an accomplished English-speaker who gave our small group of strangers a wonderfully educational and entertaining tour of what he considered to be the highlights of the museums' huge collection. It was a great way to get a feel for the place, as well as getting some valuable cultural insights from a Seoul local.After the tour we wandered around a little ourselves, then had coffee in the bright, airy restaurant on the ground floor.The National Museum of Korea is worth a look; if you're pressed for time, do some research and arrive in time for a guided tour. It's well worth the effort."
Excellent National Museum,"Very complete museum,from prehistoric era to Joseon dynasty with very huge and grand five story building. They exhibit as well artifact from all of the world. If you like art and history, it is recommended to visit this museum. Free of charge. And dont forget to visit the artshop, well more expensive but they have something that not sold in other places."
