"""I loved you"" Musical",Went there to see Lee Hong Ki performing in a musical and all I can say is that it was a one life time experience.The Venue is very impressive from all points of view from the location to the construction and the theatre itself.Totally recommend.
Good local entertainment place,"I usually go to this place to enjoy free orchestra concerts. With an extremely small income as I am currently a graduate student, the center provides me with a suitable service.The center often organizes funded concerts during weekends once a month, so I thoroughly recommend foreigners to go to the center to enjoy classical music.Audiences can find essential information about shows' schedules and entrance fees (free or not) on their official website. Funded performance usually begins at 7 pm and lasts for 2 hours with an intermission of 15 minutes."
excellent facilities & performance,"I visited there for musical 'cats' and some other classic concerts.Bus, subway are available so easy to get there.(100m from bus stop 400m from metro)The performance were excellent and the manner of audience were very nice.It is near the residential district surrounded many apartments, but across the apartments there are mountains. You can feel the atmosphere of the city and nature at the same time.뮤지컬 캐츠와 클래식 콘서트 공연을 보기위해 갔습니다.버스와 지하철로 접근이 가능합니다. 공연은 매우 좋았습니다. 청중들의 매너도 좋아서 공연의 즐거움이 배가되는 느낌이었습니다. 아파트 단지 속에 있지만 나트막한 산이 옆에 있어서 숲속 공원같은 느낌이 들었습니다."
Excellent Acoustics,Attended to see a musical in the Opera House. Beautiful venue. Polite and courteous staff handled the crowd easily. It had the hushed elegance of some of the world's greatest opera houses.The interior design allows for easy viewing of the stage from all levels.
Spectacular!!,We had tickets for Death Note the Musical (HUGE fans of Xia Junsu) for July 20th. We loved it so much we returned again August 3rd. There is an Italian cafe in the lower part where we ate supper before the show. The meals were delicious. I thought the price was about right for that type of venue. Very nice building/theater.
Deathnote Musical at the Opera House,"Actually just went here to see Deathnote musical at the Opera house. Whole facility looked nice from the outside. The opera house itself was gorgeous. Design was great so that it could fit a large audience while still providing great viewing points all around. I sat 2nd floor near that back but was still able to see the stage perfectly. Location-quite a bit of a walk from the train station. After the musical I was tired & regretted wearing heels from the initial trek up, luckily there were Taxi cabs sitting right at the entrance."
