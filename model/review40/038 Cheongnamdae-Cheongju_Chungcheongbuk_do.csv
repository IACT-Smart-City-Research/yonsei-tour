Nice place ... interesting ,I was there during last Sunday of October with some friends. The trip to cheonggnamdae is by bus.... an old fashioned bus. After half hr you reach the bus parking area ( no possible to go by car : no parking are for car) and you find a BIG queue that are waiting the bus. The first visit suggested is to enter the main building and look at some historical museum. Here you can get for free a motto on a paper with old writers characters. Then you can choose different path and different duration. The time I was there all the trees were changing colours so was amazing. Along the path you will find statues of previous presidents of Korea. It is worthwhile to visit. Interesting place to go and spend a morning. Long queue to go in and out from the bus.... bur it's valuable time....
The president's vacation home before..,"CY ( 17.12.05 ) This place was the president's vacation home before. So there had beautiful view and various facility. There was a bigger place than I think, and we enjoyed vacation home that was operating as museum. We went the observatory on the mountain, that's excellent and must go."
What A House!,"CheongNamDae is the Korean President's Summer Villa Home. Kind of like a timeshare I guess since when they aren't there, touring is allowed. The home is like any other vacation home you've seen before. Very typical two-story and spacious. It looks comfortable and homey, paying a suitable tribute to the name of a presidential retreat.I was surprised that I was able to step inside and tour the rooms too but no photography was allowed once in the villa. And it's funny because they give you disposable shoes for inside the house for cleanliness and order, so that was interesting. But it felt very open house-ish (for real estate) for my tastes so I didn't linger too much on the house tour.I actually had much more fun touring the grounds outside. I got to see the vast koi ponds, beautiful bamboo forest (my favorite), and many trail-like grounds. It felt like a very clean and well-organized park. I was able to leisurely stroll about and it felt really nice. It's extremely quiet and calming here. So if you're more into landscape than interior design, I suggest spending the majority of your time touring the grounds than inside the villa. Enjoy!"
Korean President Former Summer House,Beautiful gardens around it. Very quiet place. Perfect for vacation. You have to change shoes to get in. No picture or food allowed inside the house. Nice visit overall.
Cheongnamdae.,"This was a presidential summer house in the past, Now it is open to the public as a park. You can walk around there as if you are President of the ROK."
Fantastic place with beautiful nature. Nearby excellent restaurants.,"This place was South Korean president villa and now it is opened to public. It has beautiful nature especially in spring and autumn and quiet and calm to relax. This large place has beautiful flowers, trees, river and buildings. We stayed here about 3 hours and nearby here there are great restaurants with fantastic taste. I ate in the restaurant Majung and so much satisfied. This restaurant has only one menu which is course menu, you can taste various food which is extremely tasteful and has a lot of portion. Chungpungmyungga is another famous restaurant and very close to Majung. One of the best restaurants in Korea. Only demerit is hard to reach by public transportation. If you can drive a car, this place is definitely worth a visit. This place is one of my favorite place in South Korea."
It was okay,"This is not actually in Cheongju. It's about an hour outside of the city by express bus. The house was cool, but it wasn't anything to rave over. The walking trails aren't worth the time, except for one that you take up hundreds of stairs! The view from the top is absolutely amazing!!! It's an intense climb up, though! Grab a bottle of water beforehand!"
