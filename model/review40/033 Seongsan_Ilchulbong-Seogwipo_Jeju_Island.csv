Sunrise trek,"Arrived at the Seongsan llchubong at about 615am, an hour before sunrise at 715am. The ticket counters were not opened (opens at 730am) but the trails were available. We hiked up the 1.5km or so trail up and it took us about 30mins with a couple of rest stops. Most of the trail were stairs, only the initial path was rocky. It’s rewarding and got to see the beautiful sunrise and Seongsan town/ port in the background. "
Beautiful Scenery,"We went to Seongsan IIchubong after our lunch. We bought our admission ticket ₩5,000 per person. When we enter the park, we saw that the climb can be quite steep and decided to take the left trail which has very nice scenery of the cliff and sea. If you do not intend to climb up the Peak, just take the left trail which has gentle slopes and its free admission. You can also watch the Haonyeo performances around 3 pm from the left trail."
Easy short hike,"The short hike is easy with stairs. I went up for sun rise and sunset. The view is magnificent. There are convenience stores CU and GS25 nearby, but GS25 is further. The CU is not opened so early for sunrise hike and its staff is rather unfriendly though. Overall, I would hike again Seongsan ilchulbong if I visit Jeju again."
Nice view of natural beauty,This place is very popular in Jeju for climbing mountain and see natural beauty from the top. Highly recommended.
It was the Sunset Peak for us,"My wife and I visited Ilchulbong at 5 pm, and unfortunately, couldn't catch the women divers in action. We made it to the top and it was quite a steep climb. We were completely winded by the time we reached the peak which has a beautiful viewing deck. The moon was up on one side while the sun was setting on the other side. It was our last day in Jeju and Korea and the beautiful sunset against the skyline of Jeju was the perfect ending we could have asked for."
Wonderful! must visit!!,"Beautiful sloppy landscape by seashore, wonderful crispy fresh air, women divers hub, worth to visit!"
Easy step with nice view ,"Going out is fun, coming down is easy. My 5 yrs old enjoy so much. The view is impressive but the parking is limited "
Sunrise at Seongsan Ilchulbong,"We reached Seongsan around 5am, few peoples has started climbing. Trail quite dark all the way up. City view in the dawn during climbing is pretty. Reached to the top and sun has started to rise. Good facilities provided for the guest to view the sunrise."
Too crowded,"We went at 10am and there was a huge crowd, all trying to climb up . Took about 40 minutes climbing up, making many stops in between to enjoy the view below. It was too crowded at the top and there isnt really much to see, except for the view of course. Most people climb up, take a quick photograph and quickly climb down."
Its a climb up and down.,It took us 30 mins to climb up. Was very windy at the start but the heat from the climb took over. Lol. Managed to catch the sunrise. Everyone cheered when the sun peeked out. Bring some breakfast and hot drinks in a flask to enjoy. Yes there were PRCs talking very loudly disrupting the peace. I tot they banned PRCs to Jeju? Oh wells.Climbing down was a chilly experience but u get a really nice view of jeju going down. Lots of photo ops.
Nice trip here.,"Our hotel in old sity side. But from there use local bus( from bus terminal) W3000 one way,when we back was W1600..So cheep.Anyway,this place was 1hour round trip. quite steps has but some of them points has so nice views!!! 1 thing , this place is very windy spot.. When you go must check your clothing and hat or cap..."
Closed first Mon of the month,"Go early to enjoy the sunrise! But pls take note of the closing day because there were many tourists in the same boat as us who went on the first Mon of the month. Only a portion of the trail was open and couldnt hike to the top (free entry though). Still,nice views."
Must visit in jeju island,Very beautiful view from the top of the hill surrounding area is good for hiking a walking World heritage place can be crowded in high saison
Overrated but still good to come.,"I might not have came at the right time to enjoy the view which was why I might not have enjoyed it that much? I arrived about 1 and the sun was so hot. Paid 5000 for entry ticket and climb to the TOP. The view was good but I felt not worth the sweat and effort haha. But upon making the way down, it is a must to go see the female divers who dive without any equipment to catch seafood like octopus. Their show time is at 3pm. Make sure to watch it. "
Beautiful and worth going,"The best time to go is early in the morning, to see the sun rise. I had gone a little after the sunrise and many people were already on their way down. The views are spectacular and the way up is very safe, and good for all ages. This was probably the most memorable part of Jeju Island."
A Must See/Do,Went as part of a day tour with Yeha Tours. This was part of their East tour. Sooo worth all the steps! About 12-20 minutes to top. I slept so well that night.
Very good place,"If you want to see sunrise, please go to Seongsan Ilchulbong: It's very beautiful place. You should wake up in the early morning. It'll take 20 mins to climb in the peak. And you can experience excellent atmosphere there. You can take lots of picture because of its beauty. Good luck to you, hope you can see sunrise in the Seongsan Ilchubong"
Extinct volcano,"This spot is one of the UNESCO Heritage places, however to enjoy its beauty you’d need to visit it on a sunny day. Unlikely, it was raining heavily and was foggy when I was there. Despite that, I enjoyed the trip and the place itself, besides it was fo free if you walk around. (you’d only pay for the entrance if you want to go up to the extinct volcano crater). Landscape was amazing and loked kind of alien. Eventually, I found this spot beautiful in any weather conditions. "
Worth the climbing ,"I initially wanted to climb this peak to watch the sunrise but due to the unpredictable weather on Jeju Island whilst we were there, we decided to visit when we thought the weather would be dry at least.As it is when we reached the peak it was a bit blustery and on our descent it began to rain heavily.But this place is totally worth making the effort to climb the steps to the peak. At various points when climbing up you are greeted with really cool views. Definitely worth a visit. "
Great place for a 360° video,Itis well worth the hike up to see the view of the coastline and Udo Island. Close to the ferry to Udo.
should come early,"best view to see sunrise but so crowed. if you want to take some photo without many pp around, you should come early then start to climb on. many nice small food talls and restaurant near by. "
breathtaking view,Climb less than 30 minutes you can reach the top. Lots of stops to rest on the way up to the peak. Stop and enjoy the view on the way up.
The Sunrise peak,Amazing beach the mount and amazing women diver.Good fresh air and many kind of traditional street food
"Beautiful, but crowded ","Gorgeous view of the ocean and surrounds, but extremely crowded in summer. You should be moderately fit to make it up the steep stairway here. Tip: walk on along the main coastal road to the east of to get an alternative view of this World Heritage site. "
Beautiful...,"We visited on a sunny day, a nice change from the rain from the day before.At the entrance, you have the choice to walk around the short & free pathway by the sea or you could pay an entrance fee to hike up to the top of Seongsan for a birds eye view. We opted for the hike up.I wasn't very fit so it took me a couple of stops before I got up eventually..but the view was worth it. If you go earlier, you could catch the performance by the Haenyeo down by the shore at the bottom of Seongsan. Sadly, we did not manage to catch the performance."
Very beautiful and amazing view,"When we arrived, we were welcomed by beautiful views of the meadows and fences. The view from the top is also very nice.Not recommended for parents and young children, because the trip to the peak is around 20-30 minutes depending on each person's stamina.Overall the view of the is very beautiful.There was also a female diver show catching fish without modern equipment around 11 or 12 o'clock (forget the exact time), mostly of the female divers are aged. The catch is sold quite expensive."
Nice view,"Nice View and good for health,Guys try going this place and you will feel the Fresh of Air at top of mountain."
Worth the Steep Climb,"To make it to the summit of Seongsan, you will need to endure the flight of steep steps uphill. Good thing is that there is quite a number of rest benches for travellers who gets tired of climbing plus a drink stall mid-mountain that sells expensive isotonic drinks! Once you are at the summit, you will be rewarded with breathtaking views of the green crater. Worth the steep climb so don't give up! Another tip is that you have to plan your climb time well. Set aside 2 hours in the mountain and be sure to come back to watch the Haenyeo grannies preformance at the foot of the mountain. The performance times are 130pm and 3pm only. "
Such a beautiful peak! :),"Probably even better at sunrise, but we have been there about 11AM.Great view from the top. Center of the voulcano is nothig special at the time.Take a hat or umbrella and other protection from sun, even at not too sunny day.* Operating Hours:April-October 07:00-20:00November-March 07:30-19:00* Fees for foreigners: Adults 5,000 won / Teenagers & Children 2,500 won"
Fantastic,Amazing views all the way up and at the top. If visiting in summer - better to visit in evening or early morning. We climbed up twice - once at 5pm and then at 5.30 the next morning. Both were excellent - with different sun position giving different light and shadows. Both worth it. Fee is 5000 won per person ( half price if child or youth under 24). If you go before 7 in the morning - there is no charge. When you come down make sure that you take the path around to the right - good views down to the small beach and also on the main peak
"Beautiful Scenery, but not for the little kids in the summer","visited by family with 3 teenagers in a hot August day. It was really hot, humid day, and we climbed Seonsan Ilculdong around 3 o'clock. It is said that it took about 25 mins' walk to the top, but it was very hard to climb because of heat during hot August day. It is nice picture taking place.Do not bring little kids. It is not for the young children. I saw many children who just wear sandals climbed the all steps to the top, and they cried and were angry because of the heat and hard work. Actually, Seongsan Ilchulbong is nice picture taking place from far, but there is nothing spectacular on the top. It is better to climb Seoungsan Ilculbong in the spring or fall, not in the summer. Otherwise, it is good enough to look at it from the parking lot and take a walk around shore areas."
Wonderful scenic walk,"The hike takes about 25-30 min, but it can get quite intensive especially if you are planning to do it in the heat of summer. The view however is really spectacular. Would highly recommend it."
worth it,Best place to sightseeing and the view is amazing.You will regret if coming to Jeju but not visit Seongsan Ilchubong
Beautiful scenery on the Peak,"We stayed at Clouds Pool and Spa Hotel which is 1km away so we could reach there at 5am to do the climb. It is fairly an easy climb aided by a lot of stairs. We had breakfast at Paris Baguette which is opposite the mountain. They open at 5am. We had peaceful breakfast as we were the only couple there. The top of the peak offers beautiful panorama view of the green grass crater, sea view skyline and the other side is the Jeju city bird’s eye view. Air is fresh and very windy on the peak (I thought I could fly away). There were only 3 persons on the peak when we arrived. We could stay there for about half an hour to enjoy the scenery and the peace. The female divers abalone catching activities happen at 1.30pm or 3.30pm below the mountain. It’s another steep way down from carpark infront of Seongsan Mountain. From my hotel room, I could see people walking up to the mountains all day and evening. It’s definitely a must visit when you come to Jeju!"
Weather was not on our side,"The hike took about 30 minutes or so. Those with mobility issue may have trouble going up. However, there is another free trail that is accessible and easy for those who can't climb up.The ticket for the hike is KRW5k each.When we reached there, the weather was misty, hence we did not see get to see the famed ""Green Tea Lava Cake"". In fact, we didn't get to see anything other than we have hiked up. "
Great Hike To The Top With Superb Views!,"This is perfect for solo and family travelers that are vacationing in Jeju. Adult admission is 5,000 KW and is well worth it. The hike takes about 30 minutes to an hour and can be fairly steep in some areas. There are many shops, cafes, and restaurants around the area once you are done with the hike to the top. If you time it right, you will be able to see the famous Women Divers of JeJu who perform at 1:30 PM. The heritage behind it is very unique since it has been carried one for generations."
The view is priceless,"It absolutely great experience! The view is absolutely beautiful from the top. You have to experience it yourself. Keep your stamina full charge because you have hike to the top. The ticket is 2,000 won."
Second time visit,"Admission fee for adult is 2000won. You will be able to enjoy walking up to the peak and see the entire sea/ Mountain View. It will be good to wear covered shoes or sport shoes so it’s easier to go up the steps. Not only that, there’s a 해녀 performance available but I missed the timing. But the 해녀 will be at their store selling fresh seafood. It’s a good place for solo travellers :)After exploring ilchulbong, head over to 오조해녀의집 for some abalone porridge :D"
Scenic Views,"Must visit this place if you are in Jeju. This is the place where you can also watch women divers performance and taking the horse ride too. If you want to catch the Sunrise at the peak, start to climb at least 30 mins before the sunrise. Please check the weather first. If you are not that fit, start to climb 1 hour before the sunrise. Take note: Stairs all the way from the bottom to the top. A lot of resting area along the way. Alternatively, from the entrance, walk towards the ocean on the left. You can catch the sunrise from there too if you are too lazy to climb. The view around the mountain is fantastic. Many eateries, shops nearby. It will be very crowded from 9am onwards with many tour buses. Many parking lots nearby if you are unable to get any parking at the mountain carpark."
Famous Sunrise Peak,A must-see but be prepared for a tough climb to the top. View is fantastic! Go early if you are driving to get a parking lot (free). Beautiful flowers. 
Great view ,It Looks very high but it’s not as bad as it looks. The path is excellent and has mostly stairs. And the view is really worth it 
Good stretch ,It was a great walk with well-managed path/trail/stairs!View along the was up and down was also great!You’ll not be alone as many people keep you company.I enjoyed stretching my legs in this visit!
Nice scenic view,A great scenic trekking suitable for most. Best to view for sunrise and sunset. The trail takes 45mins for a slow leisure climb to the peak.
Sunrise at 520am,"We hiked up to the peak for Sunrise with our boys age 6&8. We started at the bottom around 4.45am. There were many people along the trail and everyone walk in the dark. Surprisingly, torchlight or headlamps are not required. With some rest on the benches along the way, we reached at 515am. The sun started to rise around 5.30am. It was truly beautifully. "
Gotta go all the way up to enjoy the view. ,"The hike up the hill was made easy with steps. But it can be tiring for elderly people. Nevertheless, one would need to take it slow and easy, don’t rush to get up there. Once you hit the peak, you will enjoy the scenic view of the crater. The cool breeze at the peak makes it even more worthy. "
Beautiful ,Best to arrive early to avoid the hordes of tourists. Wear comfy shoes because it is asteep climb up steps. Don’t bring your strollers. May not be a place to bring the older folk who might have trouble walking.
Worth the climb,Climbed it on a windy afternoon. Will take you around 20-30mins if you are reasonably fit. Spectacular views all around even before you reach the peak. Very worth the exercise. Its a 200m climb and steep at some sections. Wear comfortable shoes and clothing. Will recommend climbing early to catch the sunrise at the summit.
Do the Sunrise !,"I thought we were the minority few that would brace the darkness and hike up. Boy, I was wrong. When we reached the Sunrise Platform, some 100-200 people were there with us.And when the golden egg yolk broke the horizon, there was a chorus of 'ooooooh' as people gasped in awesome wonder. It only took 2 minutes or so for the sun to fully risen from the horizon.If the ticket counter is not open for sunrise hikers, please do not wait. Get in and begin the hike. Bring a flask of hot coffee and enjoy. Sorry, no food allowed in the park."
fantastic place,This is a fantastic place to see the awesome landscape of jeju. There is quite a bit of walking so wear comfortable shoes. It will also be rather hot in the summer as well.
Hiking for Sunrise,"Came early at 5.15 am. Reached the peak at about 5.35 am but there was no sunrise. Maybe because it was a bit cloudy due to the rain? The view however was still spectacular. I am a solo traveller and was worried about being the only person there early in the morning but nope, a lot of people including locals were there. The path was not too dark and it was a fair hike up. A few areas to stop by if you ever needed some rest. If you come in the morning for the hike, you do not have to pay any entrance fees which is actually necessary during the day (2000W).Oh the woman divers show. It was really a ‘show’ and then, they were off to the sea. I didn’t wait until they were back though. You need to pay the general entrance fee to Seongsan Ilchulbong of 2000W to gain access to the area of the woman diver.So basically I came here twice - once for the morning hike and the other one for the woman’s diver show."
No sunrise but still spectacular,"Sunrise peak in English, this volcanic cone is 182 metres high. That works out to about 25 stories which is roughly how high you have to climb to get there.And to get there early enough to get a good position, you need to get up pretty early. We woke at 4am for a 4.30 start (this after a 60km bike ride the day before and another 60 to come on the day. We went up rather more briskly than we had planned (exuberance?) and were one of the first to arrive.First, let me acknowledge the impressive steps, in stone and wood, that have been built to help people get to the top (and the separate staircase that leads you down). Kudos to the engineers and builders. They even thought of rest stops which also work well as photo opportunity spots.The amphitheater-style seats at the top are well-thought out too and provide a good view.Sunrise was scheduled for about 5.30 and a fair crowd had gathered by then.Unfortunately, the sky was overcast and we could only glimpse the sun as it occasionally peeped through the clouds. But it was spectacular nonetheless.There was no admission charge as we were up and down before the ticket booth opened at 7am.It is still worthwhile visiting even if you don't want to watch the sunrise."
Beautiful scenery ,Superb scenery especially on the way up the peak.Great place to take photos of the island.The climb up is no kidding for older people as steps are very narrow and steep. Luckily there are places for you to rest along the way up.
Sunshine Peak,"A nice little hike up to the top. Not very long, Maybe 20 minutes but ALOT of stairs. Your legs will be feeling it. Good View at the top and its nice to see all the people taking 1 million selfies of themselves while at the top. "
Heavy rain during visit,"The first 3 days were full of heavy rain and drizzles. Went here on the 3rd day, it took us more than an hour on the bus to get there. And it still rained. The hill is gorgeous but all I can say is try to pick a day without rain because it was quite slippery (figures since we wore flip flops to avoid our sneakers from getting wet). From here we went to Pyoseon Folk Village which took another hour. So from Seongsan Ilchulbong we took bus no. 295 to Pyoseon Community Centre then changed to bus no. 212 to Pyoseon Folk Village."
Perfect sunrise view,We drove from seogwipo which took around 1H drive from 4am because the sunrise at 5.40am. It took us roughly 20-30mins uphill trail to reach the peak (sunrise view point). Worth spending a morning for this beautiful sunrise view.
A gentle walk on a bunch of stairs for an amazing scenary,"Seongsan Ilchulbong is a tuff cone that has been formed from not so old (5000 years old) volcanic eruptions. It is 180-meter-high and one can walk to the top. Note that it has been well accommodated: there are stairs starting from the bottom to the top so that the walk is fairly easy. It takes about an hour for going to the top and come back, depending of course on how long one stays up-hill to enjoy the view. The view is the main thing here. It is just amazingly beautiful!First of all, one should pay attention to the different rock formations, some of them, featuring interesting shapes (see one of the two pictures I shared). Second, it is really great to stop all along the way up to enjoy the view from Jeju (see the second of the pictures I shared). On the top, one gets an amazing view on the other side (i.e. the sea). I was there in the middle of the day (there was no other way out in my case), but I can fairly well imagine the extra in being there at sunrise or sunset.Finally, note that there is an entrance fee, but it is very reasonable (about 2 USD).Overall, I strongly recommend this place and the walk. One moreover should definitely try to be there at sunrise/sunset. Please make sure to have enough water (it was really hot on the day I walked there) and be prepared: it could be crowded. The place is quite popular. There is a good reason for Seongsan Ilchulbong to be one of the top attractions of Jeju Island."
Natural beauty,"Great hike up the peak, totally worth it on a clear day. Views around very beautiful. The women diver show visible from the top when you come down. Takes about an hour to go up and back down . The view especially on the other side is the surprise when you get to the top. Even the udo island is visible from a distance . Make the effort and be rewarded."
Nice views!,"It's a lot of stairs and little walking to get to the top, but it's worth it with great views and a wonderful sea breeze. On one side you have views of the crater, on the other of Jeju island. There are lots of other tourists (mostly local) going up and down so be prepared for some level of crowds. There was abundant parking when we visited. There are also plenty of food stalls at the bottom along with bathrooms. On the way up, there are lots of benches, rest areas, and viewing platforms. We saw people of all ages - really old to really young doing the climb. If you're in town and you have a couple hours to spare, we'd recommend it!"
Beauti,"Interesting background as to how the peak was formed. The hike to the top gives a gorgeous view of Jeju Island, and if lucky the peak of Hallasan. Lots of visitors but the place is quite big enough not to make it crowded."
One of the must dos for Jeju apart from Hallasan,"Made it a point to see the performance by the elderly female divers but was a little disappointed. Worth a watch if you can make it. One motto that we came up with was, ""If you can climb Hallasan, you can do anything.""Surely enough, climbing llchulbong wasn't too difficult maybe 20-30 minutes climb?"
Scenery is Breathtaking!,"I could just sit here for a couple of hours enjoying the scenery and it's beauty. It was windy in October but very calming and relaxing. A good place to ""re-charge"" and be away from the city life."
Need stong legs,"Not for people that do not exercise.We went there is rain and fog, cannot see most of the features but it is another kind of experience. Some strange rock formations."
Nice one hour hike,"The hike was an easy one with stairs. Less than one hour slow pace hiking up. My brother brought his baby as well in baby carrier. There are a lot of souvenir shops nearby. In my experience, the souvenir sold there is much cheaper than the one in Jeju City. "
I hope this place continues to keep its charm,Beautiful but packed with tourists. Lots of walking but definitely worth it. Probably the most crowded place in Jeju but you won’t feel claustrophobic here. 
Gorgeous mountain !,"From Seogwipo , we took bus 201 and it dropped us off at the entrance. The mountain is just so beautiful to look at. It’s a very easy hike, just 25 minutes to the peak. Bring some water . Drones are not allowed. "
Hiking up to the peak 🥾⛰,"Seongsan Ilchulbing / Sunrise Peak 日出峰 , is a wonderful place for sunrise & sunset !? Yes it is. But I came here during 3pm ~ manage to walk up to the peak within 40mins ~ Although I do not have time to stay until sunset but I feel satisfy with the view of Jeju ; cooling weather and beauty of Spring. "
Easy hike,Good easy hike and once you reach the top you get to see more of Jeju. April is a good month to visit as there are less tourists and perfect weather 
Sunrise Peak,"We did this on a private basis - taking the Global Taxi - English. Found this concept very interesting. These are retired government personnels. They become taxi drivers cum guide and is divided into 3 languages - English, Japanese and Mandarin. You can also opt for jumbo taxis if you have a bigger group of 5 to 7 persons. Its more personal and driver is willing to go off the usual selected route so you are able to see much more than the standard tour. "
Magnificent Sunrise,"To see the sunrise, one has to wake up early and hike along the stairs and some stone steps and must remember to bring along a torchlight or use our smartphone's torchlight as it can be still very dark during the hike. My husband & I took 30 min to reach the peak, while waiting for the sun to rise there were many people waiting and getting ready their cameras. At the crack of dawn, one will see the sun starts to peak out and see the first rays of the sun grace the Earth. During that moment, everyone started exclaiming with delight as I believe it is not easy for some of us who do not have strong stamina when comes to hiking but it was worth seeing such glorious sight. If I have the chance to visit Jeju, I would want to visit this place again."
Heritage site,"Seongsan Ilchulbong Sunrise Peak is a UNESCO World Natural Heritage formed 100,000 years ago by an under water eruption.it has the best view of sunrise.The peak is about 600 ft above sea level and takes an hour to reach the top. It has a beautiful view ."
Beautiful scenery ,The scenery at this seongsan sunrise peak is magnificent. You will be able to view both land and water at the same time. There is also a mountain peak which u can climb to the top 
Must go,"I really loved this place. The view before climbing and the view from up is just great!If you want to go for a short hike this is the place for you! The walk up is about 15 -30 minutes, if I remember well. But it is worth the walk up!"
Must go. Wonderful view,"Really worth it. Only one way up and one way down, no u-turn. It's pretty steep Nd take energy to climb. Amazing view."
Must visit attraction in Jeju,We went near to sunset and all photos taken were nice with soft orangy hue on our face. :) It was easy climb steps to the peak and the scenery is beautiful!
Amazing view and best new experience.,"The steps are challenging but safe. The wind, though, quite strong and full speed, but the view from the top was amazing, we stayed and watched sunset."
"Beautiful, Especially during Sunrise","This was one of my favorite parts of Jeju. We went during the sunrise which reading everywhere said was most ideal, and it was gorgeous. It’s a lot of steps to get to the top. I would suggest bringing a bottle of water. "
Beautiful Sunrise,"Seongsan Ilchulbong, also known as ‘Sunrise Peak’, is a UNESCO World Heritage site. The peak is 182 metres (600 ft) above sea level. It is around 30 - 40 minutes walk/hike to reach the top. Make sure you are fit enough because the weather is cold and windy in the morning. I've been there in early March recently and it was 4°c. To reach this place, you may drive by rent a car or take a bus from Seogwipo or Jeju City. The journey takes approximately an hour and half. Starbucks is just nearby the carpark to enjoy a cup of coffee. "
Easy access by bus,"You can go to here by public bus from jeju intercity terminal, can take around 1 hour 30 minutes. The scenery is nice and great."
A must visit UNESCO place in Jeju,"As I can clearly assure that you wont be regret if you visit this place. This is my second visit to Seongsan Ilchulbong. We went there to catch a majestic sunset. We reached the parking area around 5 o'clock in the morning then we straight away climbed to the highest peak. For us, it took roughly 30-40 minutes to reached the top of the observatory area. It is indeed quite challenging but its worth it. Just bare in mind to wear the most comfortable shoes and jacket, plus dont forget to bring a mineral water."
Slow & Steady. We Made It!,We started at 9am before the busloads Of tourist started arriving. It was a tough hike because the flights of stairs were literally endless. There were many resting areas along the way and I was not shy about just sitting on the stone benches to catch my breathe. Many reviewers shared that they took between 20 to 40 mins to reach the summit. I took 1 full hour. The stairs and tracks were well maintained and most stretches had handrails. The views at mid point and the summit were superb and makes this hike so rewarding! Don’t miss visiting this UNESCO world heritage site! 
I thought I am old enough to hike,You will scream in joy once you reached the peak after the short breath hiking.Many people hike the peak including senior citizens of Korea.
Enjoy holidays,Last Sunday i stay in the best jeju seongsan hotel in front of ilchulbong .Early in the morning we go to ilchulbong. It's a very attractive place in front of sea. I like it very much 
Nature’s delight,Am a nature buff and this one is just Love❤️ A good few minutes hike and a foxy view atop awaits you.One must not miss this when in Jeju.
Super Tiring but Fulfilling Visit,"The taxi driver was really kind to walk with us, but he didn't ""warn"" us of the difficulty level and duration of the climb! :) We had lots of beautiful photos taken, in between the rest stops, and finally reached the peak with real sense of accomplishment!"
A must-see,"Also known as Sunrise Peak, this crater formation can be ascended and descended in about 50 minutes total. Path is uneven and includes lots of stairs, some steep. The viewing platform up top is all stairs, but many places to rest. Very windy. Accessible by bus 201 from the downtown Jeju/Jeju-si bus terminal."
Women Diver Show & Seongsan Ilchulbong,We did this as part of the Yeha Bus Tour East Course tour and they had it timed perfectly for us to arrive and see the Women Diver Show and then after we had enough time to make the beautiful climb up Seongsan Ilchulbong. We had beautiful weather in October - it was absolutely perfect! I would definitely recommend tennis shoes and even if the weather seems chilly when you start out - wear a jacket that you can remove. Lots of beautiful photo opportunities here!
Awesome view,It’s a must hiking course in Jeju. You’ll be leading to the top by hundreds of well made stairs. All can be seen on the top. The place is very windy but it’ll dry your sweat and the great top view will make you take lots of pictures. Enjoy the view!
Sweat a Little bit to enjoy the visit every bit,"One of the most visited Tourist attraction in Jeju, the Seongsan IIchulbong peak or the Sun rise peak was formed due to Volcanic eruption thousands of years ago. This peak has a huge cater in the middle surrounded by huge rocks making it look like a gigantic crown. In addition to this the other most sought-after attraction here is the old ladies diving deep into the water without oxygen masks to collect sea food. Twice a day a special show is conducted for the visitors.Though it was quite windy and cold when we visited, we were sweating a lot once on the top as we have to climb a lot of steps.Once on the top we were surrounded by the moving clouds, the experience which made us forget all the fatigue.We could not see the sunrise as it was quite cloudy when we visited, but as our guide informed, one can have a good view of the one during summer.At the base there are lot of eating joints which ensures everyone gets refreshed after a long trek.We thank our Jumbo taxi driver who shared the spare waterproof jerkins he had with him to wear when it started drizzling (Kin nam joon / +821046166650 / kimnj0424@naver.com)"
Worth the long climb up,Went there a few days after Xmas and the weather was cold and hence made the climb easier. If we had came during summer I would never have wanted to make the climb. As it is with the cold weather and strong winds we made the climb with 2 or 3 stops in between to catch breath and take photos of the magnificent views. If you have kids or old folks to take care I wouldn't recommend the climb. 
Must track up to enjoy the view,"Although this mountain is nice from afar, I will still recommend to take the ~ 30-40 mins hike up. It’s a bit tiring but they have many rest stops if needed. Fantastic views from the top to make the trekking worthwhile. "
Short hike up to the peak,"The hike up takes about 30 mins depending on your fitness level and speed. It is pretty easy climb up the steps and boardwalk. It was drizzling when we were there. Nevertheless, the surrounding view on top was nice. At eye level, the crater wasn't obvious as it looked more like a downhill slope. It would be great if a an observation tower is built to have an aerial view of the crater.Entrance ticket 2000 won. Suggest you relief yourself just before the entrance as there isn't any toilet facilities at the peak."
Short 40 mins hike up and down for good panaromic view,"For those who are not really into long hikes and yet still want a good panaromic view of Jeju’s surroundings, this is the place. There are also live performances apparently involving the female divers but we missed the timing. "
Simple hike up and down before udo island,"I think that it's not as grand, but the stairs are well kept and in good shape. There's a lot of people and a lot of food too. Parking wasn't an issue for us.I've been twice, and maybe it wasn't anything special to me as I didn't get to go in the morning to watch the sunrise. But be prepared to walk up with a lot of people"
A short intense climb for magnificent views,"There were many scenic views at this attraction. I enjoyed both the ascent and descent. Even with the chilly breeze, one is sure to perspire upon arrival at the peak. The view into the crater at the peak was another awesome feast for the eyes. The sea as the backdrop served as a picturesque addition to the already scenic composition. After the descent, there were opportunities to witness the infamous women free divers of Jeju. These minimalist free divers were equipped with their orange flotation devices, masks and dry suits, sustained their tradition daily in the frigid waters to harvest seafood from the shallow depths. Why pass on this opportunity?"
"Awesome views, easy walk",A great place to visit for fantastic coastal views of Jeju. The boardwalk was well constructed and easy for most people to walk. The women divers’ shows are scheduled at 1.30 and 3 pm.
Nice walk,"We did the sunrise peak climb as part of our tour of Jeju with Yeha bus tours - it wasnt at sunrise, but it was pretty pleasant nevertheless.We started off by watching the women divers at the bottom of the cliff. After this, it is an easy 20 - 25 minute climb up - with gorgeous views over the sea and island. Unfortunately, part of the peak was fenced off because of some maintenance work . We had a nice walk down, enjoying the views .Tips:There are clean restrooms midway down.Try the peanut and orange ice cream at the base of the cliff - oth are yummy. "
Great views!,The effort to go to the top was totally woth it :) I really hope to go back very soon <3 Amazing landscape!
Nice sunrise views on clear day,The walk up the stairs is hard on knees but not specially challenging and can be done in 15-20mins. Make sure to be on top a bit before sunrise or otherwise gets quite packed with people and is hard to find a good spot to seat and see the sunrise. We got a somewhat cloudy morning so sunrise views were quite disappointing.
Really beautiful landscape,"We arrived just prior to sunset and it was very beautiful to watch the sun go down on the opposite end of the island, would definitely recommend it. The hill itself is really pretty and a great place to get some photos."
Attracted By History Of Women Divers,A great place to start off is the Women Divers exhibition center to see the old photos and explanation from the staff on the history of Women Divers. Than a slow walk up the peak for a great view .... the wind was hallowing when we climb up and the local told us its a normal day ... plenty of great eateries just a short walk from the entrance after the climb . A MUST visit .
Worth to climb,"20min climb up to peak, short time but take some energy to climb up, come down is easy. So get ready to take off your jacket even is cold day. But worthy, nice view. And can see haenyeo performance as well, but must check the time. One day 2 slot, afternoon is 3pm."
Great view,Be prepared to climb flights of stairs to get to the top to enjoy the great view. Good pair of shoes would be helpful.
Must visit!,"Great place! A must visit if you’re in Jeju. Do give it a climb if you have the endurance. Awesome view and lots of picturesque scenery. If you are in luck, may even catch the sea ladies diving. "
Another climb in Jeju,"Always a joyful climb up the steps to the top and capture a view of the ocean. Awesome view, great exercise! Must do in Jeju"
Must visit!,This sight is at the extreme south east of Jeju. There are many great views and cafes within this area. This is a short hike up a beautiful hill and after the hike there is a haenyo performance where old ladies dive without oxygen tanks to collect abalones. I regretted not spending a full day in this area to chill.
Beautiful view from the top,The hike up will take around 20-30 mins depending on your speed. It's pretty steep stairs going up but you can take your own sweet time to enjoy the breathtaking view while hiking. 
Not to be missed,Imposing scenery! So many photo opportunities on this beautiful landscapeWent back twice cos I didn't realise the hanyeo diver women show is there..was searching around somewhere else. Time your visit to see these amazing old ladies diving at 3pm. 
Should be on the TO DO List in Jeju,One for the books.The climb is worthit though we weren't able to watch the sunrise due to the gloomy weather. The view is relaxing - makes you think of living on this laid back place in Jeju.. 
Nice hike up Iichulbong,"went there after breakfast and was a good time to start if you didn't care too much of sunrise view. Even though it was windy and chilly, got up to the top sweaty and hot. you see see pretty ckear view from the top; Udo island, the wind turbines in the east, Seopjikoji in the south."
Few Tips...,Well worth the hike even on a cloudy day. If you go to see the sunrise like we did and it's dark don't forget to read the signs! We totally missed the sign that said no eating at the top...Oops! We were going full speed on the way up to make sure we did not miss the view. Be advised....trail up and down is not the same. If you want to enjoy both make sure you give yourself enough time. Both trails are beautiful and I wish we had enjoyed the trail going up a little slower. If you are active this should be easy although expect stairs as with any Korean hike! Plenty of parking and bathrooms at the bottom.
Don't miss the women divers,Walk to the top is quite easy with good views.Don't miss the signpost to the women divers near the bottom on the way down. They do a few shows a day and you don't have to pay extra to see it.Lot's of parking and eateries in the area
Amazing View from above,"Knowns also as Sunrise Peak. We went there on afternoon as we did not know this place can see beautiful sunrise. Must visit place when you in Jeju Island. Worthwhile hiking by stairs about 45 minutes. This wonderful craters formed from volcanic eruption l00,000 years ago. Entrance Ticket KRW2000. Twice a day can see women divers go to the sea and singing before catch their seafood such as abalone, sea urchin, etc. Overthere you can ride pony horses"
The place was worth the hike!,"It was tiring but the view was worth it! Please bring a bottle of water on your way up. Take photos of the sceneries going up and down,they were beautiful!"
Impressive scenery !,"Unfortunately there was so much wind and rain during our stay on Jeju Island, based in Seogwipo. That day, we braved the elements and took the bus to visit the beautiful site of the volcano Seongsan-ri.The visit was worth the climb."
Worth the visit! ,"Came at autumn, the weather was 18degrees but once you start climbing, be ready to take off your jacket. A total of 50min hike with magnificent view is totally worth it. Love the crater and all round view at the peak. "
Beautiful first stop on Jeju,"Once my family landed at the airport, we rented a car and drove! This was a great option to Hallasan for family members that could not hike the summit as the trails are very nice, and the views are achieved after only a moderate walk and stair climb."
Option to Hallasan hike,"If you have a tight schedule and cannot afford a whole day climbing the Hallasan Mountain, or some of your group physically can't do Hallanshan, this is a good option, because it is closer to other sight seeing places so you don't need a whole day, also because it is a much easier climb compared to Hallasan.The day we visited this was not crowded at all because everybody went to Udo Island on the opposite, after a two day close of the ferry service due to weather. If there was a helicopter service i(not sure), it must be very spectacular from an aerial view. From the ground level, if you didn't see the photo from the Internet, nor post cards, you probably don't realize it is a flat volcanic crater.Anyway, it would be quite a nice walk close by other sightseeing places, but might look more impressive from opposite Udo, or from a plane or helicopter"
"Beautiful, even if only viewed from a distance ","I didn't know I was looking at this famous peak when we approached in a taxi (looking for a lunch spot that our kids would approve of). I was saying ""Wow, look at that"" as we drove towards it. Then our driver explained it was the famous peak. I can see why, even on a cloudy rainy day it was such a beautiful scene. We couldn't climb to the peak because it was closed to the public due to an impending typhoon. I was disappointed we couldnt climb but so glad that we got to see it, even from the base. Absolutely beautiful area. I want to come back to Jeju just to climb that peak and see the beauty from above.Incidentally there were plenty of restaurants and cafes and shops in the small town at the base. Even an American Embassy (i.e. Mcdonalds) "
Beautiful View,Ample parking lotVery scenic mountain viewThe breeze were very strongNeed to purchase a ticket to enter
Amazing view at sunrise or set,"Reminder: do check this place out , esp during sunning days. We got the chance to walk through the hiking track around it at 5PM and its just breath taking, later we found out it's the no.1 to do on jeju!You get a million dollar view of the ocean and the mountain and you probably have seen something like this in New Zealand or South africa but not in Asia. Very stunning !"
Nice view ,"Seongsan ilchubong has a very nice view on top of the mountain or even before u climb. Everywhere is so beautiful. Entrance ticket is 2000 won per person. Ilchubong means sunrise mountain. Normally people are there to watch sunrise. But we were there in the evening about 4pm. The view is nice too. There are performance of haenyeo (dive women) at beach near the mountain everyday at 1:30pm and 3pm. We missed the time. I was so regretted. The parking area is spacious. We had our dinner at a seafood restaurant near the mountain. Reasonable price with superb ingredients. Crabs, prawns, squids and 5 live abalone and other seafoods with only 100,000 won for 4 persons, we eat till very very full and satisfied (100,000 won is 3 persons portion). The boss of the restaurant is also very friendly. "
Wonderful views and climb to the top,"We walked up to the top to enjoy the breathtaking views. I felt that this was a mountain instead of a hill. It was really worth the trip to the top. The history of the area too makes visiting the area worthwhile, so many great views from both high up and down at ground level."
Magnificent!!!,"We took out 10 and 7 year old up here. Granted, they are quite active. Still managed the climb up to the top within 20 mins. The view is spectacular, hardly can believe its real. Well worth the effort. "
Nice breeze and view,We did not climb to the top. But the plateau is already spectacular enough with many photo spots around. There is women diver demonstration but it takes place at fixed intervals and we missed the last one at 500pm.There is also a horse riding demonstration at fixed interval with the last one at 330pm.
A pleasant hike to prepare for Hallasan,"This is an easy hike, all stairs. Maybe not suitable for those who are not fit/those who cannot handle stairs. Kids can do this though. The summit wasn't spectacular -- it was more of enjoying the ascent."
Didnt see anything due to heavy fog,It was heavily foggy with strong wind when I went there. It rained too. We bought a raincoat for krw 2000. Entrance fee about krw 2000 as well. A lot of fog we could not see the caldera but we hiked all the way
Most beautiful sunrise seen,"Sunrise is at 615 am . The entrance fee is free if you arrive before 7 am . Free Car park to the viewing points a short 8-10 minutes walk away , very doable and you get one of the most memorable sunrise sights . A most do except the getting there so early in the morning is hard . "
Worthwhile Visit,"Get your legs ready for lots of stairs! The hike was definitely worth it though, great views from the peak! "
One of highlight of Jeju,Very nice view - natural setting is also very beautiful and its not very difficult to climb up to the top. We travel by bus to the place but its quite time consuming and tired compared with own driving
Moderately intense hike due to heat,"My mum who's 69 hiked up with difficulty, not because of the height, but more of the heat. Don't recommend hiking up during summer, the sun hits direct to you as you hike and dismount. But despite this, the view was amazing. "
Superb views,"Love this place. The hike up is not difficult. There is a proper trail and stairs. You get magnificent views on the way up and down. Also, you can go all the way down to the ocean for great views as well."
Beautiful view,"The walk up sunrise mountain was windy and relatively easy. Steps all the way up with many spots for you to rest and take in the beautiful view. Don't miss out on this mountain if you are going to Jeju. Entrance fee is 2000W. They charge for everything here, waterfalls and parks all have an entrance fee."
Popular and ok,"Ok. It is crowded, but also well organized. Steep oh yes, but not much of a climb. So most everyone can do it - we didn’t go with the sunrise crowds - and it is a nice excursion. But to really get something out of it do read up on some geology - after all Jeju is all volcanic "
Mesmerising view,"We went 5am morning hike to catch the sunrise, however due to the foggy weather, the sun was quite shy. Nonetheless we still enjoyed the view when we hiked down. "
Cool Place,Must go place in Jeju. Great view from up of the top of the hill. 30 minutes approximately to go up the hill. Lovely view.
Beautiful coastal area,The rock formations near the water are absolutely remarkable. I recommend taking the time to visit if you are on Jeju Island.
A lot of stairs!,"Amazing place to visit, with an incredible view, but to arrive there you have approximately 250mt of stairs! Don't forget to take some water and a hat!"
very nice place,"非常棒的地方, 美麗的風景. 從入口處登頂, 慢慢走, 邊拍照, 用不到 25 分鐘 (以一個上了年紀走路緩慢的長者而言), 大多數是階梯.Very nice place. Beautiful landscape. Short & easy hiking to mountain peak from entrance (mostly stairways, less than 25 minutes by a slow aged tourist)"
My Mini Family Winter December 2012,I know it was way too late but i just wanna review it.We went there when our girl was 1 year old and winter was too cold for her especially doing outdoor activity.The peak was so beautiful and calming.From the cliff can saw woman scuba divers
nice view,climb to the peak is tiring as mostly incline steps.. everyone was panting lol. the shorter and easier route would be via the return track.. view is quite nice out into the sea..
You must see this if you're in Jeju,The one place you have to see if you're in Jeju. No regrets going up in the midst of heavy rain. The caldera was still impressive. And the view from the top over the town is nice.
Great Hike with 4 years old,The scenery is absolutely stunning at the top. We brought our 4-years old kid along and we were initially worried if the hike is too tiring for him. We were so wrong! He loves the hike and has lots of fun along the way. Just make sure that you have sufficient time to finish the hike before it closes. Would strongly recommend this place for families even with young children!
Great Early Morning Walk,"We took a walk up seongsan ilchulbong, to get a glimpse of the early morning sunrise.It didn’t disappoint.The walk was very easy to complete (we had a 7 & 4 year old with us).And not to be a cheapskate, but it’s totally free if you start your climb before 7am......after that time you have to purchase tickets."
This place has an amazing view.,"One of the best views on Jeju island. The climb is not that hard, my 7 year old daughter and 65 year old mom managed to do it in 25 minutes. 15 minutes to go down. Its all stairs, plenty of places to rest. There is a small shop with regular prices (yes they could have charged 5 times for a bottle of water but they do not do that so hurray for the owner) half the way. There is no shade at the top but the view is really, really great. "
Go early,Should go early as you will need a lot of energy to climb up. Bring all the sun protection with you as there isn't much shades. 
Stunning Views,"There was no sun in a June afternoon, the temperature was pleasant and the air was clear. I climbed up to the top to view the crater which is covered by lush green. The climb was pleasant along with the gorgeous views. The views on the way up were lovely, there were many places for great photo op. I appreciated the views from the top, views to the city and views to the sea without interruptions. It was one of the most memorable experiences I recorded in Jeju."
Too hot for me to climb but still incredible views,"It was a very hot day yesterday, July 31st 2018, and I got sunburn the day before so in 33 degree heat and me didn't match. I didn't go up to the top but I did go up to the first viewing platform, which i think most people would be able to manage slowly, not matter your age. It is well paved, and the views are incredible. It was a very windy day too, so there was no show by the women divers, Haenyo, but you could see where they went out and to be honest the roughness of the seas showed how tough the women must have always been. There are a few shops near the bottom and one part way up, so you can purchase drinks and trinkets if you wish. There is a Starbucks and a Dunkin' Donuts and i think a McDonald's near the car park, as well as multiple Korean restaurants. Well worth a visit, even if you can't ascend to the peak."
"Tough, but rewarding climb to the top","Instead of getting up at 4 am to hurry and climb the mountain in the dark before the sun rises, we made the climb in the evening in time to see one of the best sunsets and overall views ever. There are three trails going to the top. Be sure to take a different trail each way because the views are much different. "
Enjoyable,"It was very windy and the place was stunning, you might want to stay nearby to wake up and see the sunrise, the place is to see sunrise."
Good Place,"It only takes 45 minutes to hike even with the normal speed. The top view is also amazing, The best time to come here is in the sunset time. This place is worthy even though a little far from Jeju City"
Amazing climb and views,"This is worth a trip to Jeju all by itself! Going up to the peak looks intimidating, but it was pretty easy and we saw a woman in her 70s at the top. It's hundreds of stairs and took about 35 minutes, but they have benches and a lot of shade on the way up. There's a path designated for ascending and another for descending, and I recommend following them as intended. We saw some people trying to beat the crowd by going up the 'down' path, but there aren't benches to rest on and not much shade on that path; also, the ascending path is a LOT steeper and the stairs are kind of narrow (like a typical home staircase), so if you go down the 'up' path, you'll be going down very steep stairs and shuffling around people, while the designated 'descending' path is a very gradual slope and much wider. We went on a hot & humid day, but I unquestionably would do it again."
Physical but worthwhile,"The trail leading to the top is likely hard on anyone, but the view from its top is really amazing. Worths a visit."
Its alright,We arrived at around 5pm. The hike wasn't sure too bad (took us about 20-25 mins to reach the top) but it was a very hot and hazy day. I am sure the view is a lot better during sun rise. 
Very scenic ,"One of the top 3 things to do if u come to Jeju. Very scenic, unfortunately the weather is too hot for us and with a Ren year old in toll, it’s too difficult to hike to the top. But I’m quite sure I’ll be back to hike to the top during the cooler season. We were lucky to be able to catch the female divers and also watch them perform a song before they start diving. You can buy their fresh / live catch and eat on the spot."
Wonderfull view,I go there when winter season.. the wind is really strong.. dont forget to bring your winter coat and your gloves when visit there.. the view is really wonderfull.. must visit when visit Jeju
Beautiful and worth the climb,Beautiful and breathtaking view! weather in July was windy and cool. Not so hot. Even my 5 year old enjoyed the climb all the way up :)
Worth the walk in the area even if you don't hike up,"If you've read my post about my 14 hours hike, you'd understand why I didn't go up this peak lol. Anyway, I strolled around the area and had dinner so it's still nice to watch the sceneries around it. If you're sick of Korean food, there's McDonald's, Starbucks and Dunkin' Donuts. Not to mention a fish and chips shop (on the two-way main road) , but I'm not sure if it's good. If you're not sick of Korean facial and body products shopping, Innisfree and Nature Republic are around there. "
Nice view,should walk to the peak to see the amazing view of jeju island. sunny day is the best day to go so you can get clearer view.
A must go in Jeju,A 20-minute easy climb to the top awards you with good scenery. Remember to visit the the free women diver show 130pm and 3pm. 
This is a beautiful view Seongsan Ilichulbong,We took the bus to get to this location and was dropped off at the bus stop. There were no signs how to get to the destination so we went to the nearest hotel to inquire. They pointed us the way and we forgot to ask how far it was. We still did not find any signs how to get there but after walking 15-20 min found the entrance. The scenery is beautiful and we took several pictures. 
"Good exercise, worth it for the views","I was told the hike up will only take 30 minutes but when I looked at it I was convinced it would take longer. The hike up is quite steep, lots of stairs, however it really just took a bit more than 30 min, to my own surprise. The hike is not easy however, it requires some stamina, many people take a break or two on the way up. Definitely bring something to drink. Seongsan is quite crowded with tourists, so lots of people all over. The hike is worth it, amazing views from the top. And the hike down is much more enjoyable then the one up. At the foot of Seogsan is a large parking lot, easy to leave your rental there, plus again lots of cafes, restaurants etc. You have to pay a fee to enter.Overall worth seeing Seongsan!"
All you need is dream,"I was thinking about Seongsan Ilchulbong, dreaming about it, visualizing the moments & details of the day, and just rushed to the legendary place sponteneously. Moved from Jeju Bus Terminal totally on my own. An hour & a half and you are there! Enjoy:-)"
Unfortunately not able to visit for sunrise ,Would have been nice to visit for sunrise but we were reliant on public transport. Still glad we did it in the morning. Jeju is alot larger than we thought and it was more than an hour to get there on the bus from the bus station. It's less than 200m high but it felt like a struggle to get to the top! I think we took about half an hour for the climb. The pathways are very well laid out and it was very busy with visitors. Nice view while climbing. Right at the top it's more the crater you see so it was a sea of green when we were there. Defo worth a visit when in Jeju. From there we travelled to Seogwipo
Beautiful place,"Hike to the peak for a wonderful view, Jeju island is blessed wit so many nature attraction & Seongsan IIchulbong is one of it, did not get to see the women divers performance as the wave was very strong during our visit but we manage to see live women divers at other place the next day. Walk around and enjoy the nature."
A good hike - but not a ‘wow’ view.,Reaching the top will provide you a panaromic view of the town below but that’s about it. It has a small piece of land where stadium like seats had been built. You cannot roam around coz it’s restricted as it’s shaped like a bowl and it’s just covered with trees and all.. 
Nice summit view!,Everyone should try reaching the peak with your loved ones. The summit view is amazing and you would feel a sense of achievement once you reached the top. Beginners can do this within 40mins!
Nice and beautiful place,"It is surely a must-go attraction in Jeju. With only KWN2000 (adults) to this nice park, it is reallt worth it. Too many steps in descending and ascending way, not a wheelchair or elderly friendly place "
Lots of steps but worth it!,A well organised site to view this magnificent natural phenomenon. There were a lot of steps for those with limited mobility. Take some water too.
Reached on a sunny afternoon!,"Except for a few good and clear moments on the first afternoon, didn't get any clear day and was virtually rained in. But Seongsan was a nice little to walk around with some fabulous sea food places. "
Scenic place.,It's 180M high and takes approx 1.5 hours for return journey.The view from top of the mountain is really spectacular.
The Sunrise Peak,"Took a bus from Seogwipo early morning and it takes around 1 hour 40 minutes to get there as the bus stops on all stops along the way. Once there, it is a short 10 to 15 min hike up to the top where you will be met with a green crater. Unless you have a drone, its not possible to capture the beauty of the place unfortunately. On the way down, we waited to see the women diving show, but it got cancelled which was a let down as we only got to know after the show was supposed to start. "
Amazing women free-divers and sunrise at the peak,"We visited Seongsan Ilchulbong on two separate days - the first was in the afternoon to see the women free-divers' performance (1pm/3pm) and the second was in the wee hours of the morning (5+am) to see the sunrise. The free-divers were all middle-aged women who looked old enough to be our mothers. Despite their age, it was amazing how they managed to hold their breath so long underwater to harvest the seafood which you could buy from them and eat on the spot (they'll prepare/cook it in whichever way you want). The way they sang prior to the dive and the way they chatted and swam out to sea together reminded us of the friendly grannies in our neighborhood enjoying a nice chit-chat over tea. To see the sunrise at the peak, we started our climb at 4+am (it helps to stay in a hotel within walking distance to Ilchulbong). It was pitch-dark and torchlight was a must. The climb was shorter than expected and we reached the top before 5am. Thankfully the sky was clear that morning and we managed to catch a beautiful sunrise (around 5:30am) that was nothing short of amazing."
well worth the climb,"Beautiful scenery at the top with breathtaking surrounding views of Jeju. Well maintained stairs, although uneven at first because they use the volcanic rocks, Many resting places as you go up. There is a lady at the top who explains the origins of the peak in English, which was a pleasant surprise. Large carpark area, fast food stores and souvenir shops. "
Not just about the summit,"It was really hot when we arrived so we did not go up the summit but explored the surrounding. You could walk to the left where you will come to several flights of steps leading down to the beach where the haenyeo or women free divers will perform their skills. If you do not fancy walking all the way down, just continue left as you will come to a cliff overseeing the Udo island. Another go to place in jeju. Understand that this island is form from volcanic eruptions much like jeju is as well. There are also lots of photo opportunities at the foot of the 180m+ mountain(?). Of course the usual F&B outlets are here as well. We also see some signage for horse riding but did not explore. "
Should have more time,I came here for a quick photo moment. Although I had paid for the entry. I didn’t have the time to go up the peak to view the scenery. My limitation is that I have two young boys with me. But if I could I would want to go up and have a view. But I had also managed to catch some nice photo at this tourist attraction.
Beautiful sunrise and close to nature,"This is a heritage site regarded as one of the New 7 wonders. Many people come to this place. The parking is huge but can be tight at times. Better to come here in fair day, so that you will enjoy the view. Bring your camera and water too. There are quite number of fastfood on the area if you need to buy snacks."
Beautiful coastline.,A nice stroll along a coastline that is inspiring. Take the time to enjoy this place - don’t just blow past it. Look at the years of nature carvings and imagine what it was like when first inhabited. 
Seongsan Ilchulbong - The Volcanic crater of Seongsan Ilchulbong,"A beautiful view on top of Seongsan IIchulbong. Plenty of parking. We did this twice in the same day. The first hike (approximately 30 minutes to get to the top, started at 1pm) was extremely foggy and we couldn't see anything. We hiked back down and spent some time on the shore. Once the sun came out we hiked back to the top. There are several stops on the way with spectacular views of Jeju. You can purchase drinks and trinkets from one small shop about half way up. Use the restroom before going up as there is not one on the way. For a family of three to include a 10 year old we took one large bottle of water and a small backpack with some snacks and additional items. Bring a camera as it is absolutely beautiful. On the way we saw several different species of birds and spiders. At the top there are several benches where you can sit and enjoy the view. At the bottom there is a Mcdonalds, an ice cream shop, a souvenir shop, and other small shops. I suggest you try the orange ice drinks...they are great! Overall cost, 5,000 won for two adults and one child. We paid cash. Enjoy!"
Rewarding view at the peak,"Well maintained, easy hike up and down with the peak. Designated route for upwards hike and descending, so do not go against the flow. Very rewarding view at the peak. Take note of the women driver performance, twice a day. We missed it as we read online that it was 3.30pm, but it was actually 3pm."
Fantastic View,The climb is relatively easy and it's not necessary to visit there to watch the sunrise. The view in the morning is also great. There is also alot of parking space at the bottom so there no need to worry about that.
Wonderful Views,"There are wonderful views from the peak here, and the walk up is pleasant enough. I just hope that the loudspeakers blasting explanations (in various languages) are removed in the future. They really spoil the atmosphere and convey the same information that can be conveyed on a sign.Admission is 2000 won."
Fantastic Attraction,This is a MUST go attraction in Jeju. You will need around 1- 1.5hrs to complete the entire trail. Parking will be 1000 won
Breath-taking scenery,A mountain with beautiful scenery. I did not manage to climb all the way up to the top as I was having knee problem but my friend did. It was really beautiful even when I was only half way up the mountain. I also enjoyed the nice cooling breeze that made me want to stay longer if possible. Worth the visit. Probably will visit this mountain and climb up again next time.
Must try. Best Natural Observatory,Ilchulbong means a peak for watching sunrise. But seongsan Ilchulbong is a place where u can enjoy superb views from every directions. Many people are rushing. It is recommended to watch before 9:00 am on weekdays. 
Beautiful crater rim / cone,"Rushed to watch the sunrise. Starts around 5am and everybody walk as fast as they can but once reach the stairway, mostly starts to b exhausted. Took some rest by snapping some pictures. Suddenly reached at 530am and already some crowd booked their best location for taking the sunrise. Anyway its a must do activity once you are in jeju island. "
"If you haven't seen the top of Hallasan Mt, visit this","Yesterday I was from the top of Hallasan Mt. And today I visited this place. It was crowded with students for their study trip. The view is pretty, but since there are too many people, I enjoyed it less, sadly. Perhaps I came here at the wrong hour, I came on Wednesday around 3 pm. If you go here when it's fewer people, you will get a nice panorama shot. It's mentioned that to go up and down you need 50 minutes. With many people before you, you need more. So much human traffic for today. Since I was from the Hallasan Mt, I preferred to hike Hallasan then visit this one. But it is still pretty tho, don't worry. Just not meeting my expectation I guess."
"Unfortunately, we had low clouds",The top of Sunrise Mountain was obscured by clouds when we were there. We climbed up. It’s somewhat steep but there are benches for stopping along the way along with one restroom area about 1/3 of the way up. Signage also in English. It was extremely windy up at the top and we were in the clouds. We had some visibility downward but very little outward.
It was so worth it!! ,"Seongsan Ilchulbong greets us in drizzled rain with fog everywhere making the place look mystic. However we put on raincoat and keep hiking. Halfway we stopped when all of us already looking dreadful.Since nobody want to keep climbing we make way to see the hanyeo. Eventho we didnt climb up to the peak, it was already so worth it. The view is something u cant get else where. Someday will come back to hike again! "
UNESCO heritage ,"Breathtaking view when you reached the peak. Time taken from entrance to the peak ~60mins. You can get a chance to see woman diver show but too bad we did not get a chance for it due to time constraint. Tips: please wear comfortable shoes for walking, the stairs can be steep, and eat some food before that for good stamina. "
Beautiful scenery,The view is good but the climb is tiring in spring with the cold wind. You have to climb about 30 mins to make it to the top. 
Nice trek with great view,"It is a very popular tourist hotspot, but is a short trek anywhere from 30mins to 1 hour trip to the peak. Offers a very nice view of the city as well as the sea. It is called Sunrise Peak for the very reason many climb this to watch sunrise. If time allow, try to plan for either sunrise or sundown for an excellent view from a high vantage point in Jeju. Every trip to Jeju, I try to make this spot one of my visit for at most 2-3hours. But beware of the tourist shop around here, they are all overpriced."
Stunning views and Jeju mermaids!,This was one of my favourite parts of Jeju! Truly so beautiful!A stunning view and so much history learning about the Haenyeo (or 'Jeju mermaids') who were diving whilst we were there. We also took a ride on the jet boat which leaves from nearby. So much fun!
Also called Sunrise Peak--a wonderful hike with stunning views from the crater's edge,"The Seongsan Sunrise Peak is a crater with views from the overlook at the top edge of the crater, and a paved stairway/walkway up to the crater's edge. A ticket is required to hike up the hundreds of steps to the overlook on the ridge of the crater, but if you are up to it, the view from the top is wonderful. The crater is accessible from a causeway connected to the main island, but is itself surrounded by water everywhere except along the causeway, which adds to the view of the clear water below. Parking is available at the crater, along with rest rooms at numerous places near the parking lot and shops, and one more restroom on the path, near where the uphill and downhill paths cross. I always recommend carrying some toilet paper and hand towelettes in case they restrooms don't have them.The women abalone divers perform a couple of times in the afternoon on most days, so that might help determine your schedule. Also, the smog was fairly thick the day we were there, so it limited a lot of the view of the island from the top of the crater. The view nearby was still beautiful. On a side note, we visited on a tour from a cruise ship. There are 2 cruise ports on the island, one in the south port and one in the north port. Where you port could determine your itinerary since various and impressive sights are available close to either town/port.The island has so much to offer – large lava tunnel caves, waterfalls, craters, mountains, cliffs, black sand beaches, incredible fresh seafood, and more but they are spread throughout the island, so it is impossible to see all of them in one area or in a short amount of time. Also, some of the attractions are restricted, so they might require group access, or have other requirements to enter. This attraction had a ticket kiosk near the entrance, so it didn't look like it had any restrictions for individuals to either enter or buy tickets. We concentrated on the east end of the island during our visit and found it to be similar to Hawaii in many ways other than the temperature, which was quite a bit cooler than Hawaii during our visit at the end of March (55 deg F was our high temp). Even this crater reminded us of Diamond Head, in Honolulu."
MAGNIFICENT,"a must climb to catch the view from the top. we were prized with a scenic view of jeju around seongsan after a less than 20 minutes climb. there were alot of eateries and cafes, souvenir stores surrounding seongsan."
We caught the sunrise and it was incredible.,"Sunrise was at 5:58AM April 19th, 2018. We woke up ans started walking to the crater at 5:15 AM and had ample time to get up and witness what may be the only Unesco protected sunrise. We walked from the Co-op City Hotel and took about 10-15 minutes to get to the start of the path. It took another 20 minutes to climb to the lip of the crater. It can be challenging for some but is is fine for anyone of average active health.Breathtaking views."
Very nice view,"Seongsan illchubong is one of seven wonder world. Is not enough for you to arround this place for few time only. I suggest you to visit this place 1 day full. So, you can also watch women diver perform at 13.00 pm until 15.00 pm"
Must go!,unesco world heritage !! When I went there it's snowing. very cold. But view was very very gooddddd. Mountain and sea were absolutely breath-taking. The stair was high. You should beware.
Best place for sunrise or sunset,"It is a good place to watch the whole seaside view and the horizon of the sea where the sky meets the sea. The view is breathtaking as you can see not only the sea view but the city view of Jeju island and the mountain in the background. However, one need to put in the effort and climb 45 minutes up to the mountain top in order to enjoy this view. And also hope for the best of luck that it is not a cloudy day."
You will be in awe of the sunrise and sea of clouds!,"Please stay around, check the sunrise time and go early. It’s took me 30 minutes to get up to the top. The climb is not easy, I took few breaks before reaching the top. I’m glad that I made it on time for the sunrise.It’s one of the best sunrise I’ve ever witnessed. And, the sea of clouds made me heaven! The picture doesn’t do the view justice. Trust me, you have to experience it by yourself! For your reference, I stayed at Seongsan Sunrise Hotel which is walking distance to Seongsan Ilchibong and Gwangchiji beach. It’s also short distance to Seopjikoji and Udo by cab. Public bus in Jeju is very convenient. You can take bus from Jeju Airport to Seongsan Ilchibong stop without transit."
A place for sunrise ,"Do check on the sunrise timing before heading up. We took about 45-60mins to climb up, taking short breaks in between. The place can be quite dark at 430am, so do bring along a portable torchlight. The torchlight mode from Smartphones just isnt bright enough. If you enter before 7am, there is no admission fee. Or rather, the admission office starts at 7am. So, lucky for us.The stone stairs are well maintained, im amazed, especially this is a popular spot for sunrise.We went during late March, transition period to Spring and the temperature was about 12-14 degree celcius in the wee morning. Although it might be chilly in the morning, pls do not wear thick clothing or heattech, as you will start to swear & feel hot after climbing up the stairs. So just like the locals, just don something light and with a windbreaker. If you scare you still might feel chilly, have a heatpack to warm your hands. It is important to carry light.However, i didnt get to see the sunrise. ): it was way too cloudy. Oh well.. "
Save money on the crude shore excursion by just...,"Had a port of call in Jeju. The cruise offered a number of shore excursions. Instead, we took the free shuttle into town. It dropped us off right by the underground mall (half block past it)We walked around a bit then hailed a taxi. He agreed to a fixed price of $100 USD to take us to the folk village, then to sunset peak. (The cruise was $119 per person so we saved $138)We climbed to the top. It was strenuous but with frequent stops we made it. It’s like 59 stories. At the to you get a great view of the town and the sea. You also can look down into the volcano (and see a grassy crater)A million photos later we came down. We then went and saw the women diver demonstration. That was fun. They sang for a while then went fishing. While we were there, one of the ladies caught an octopus. I don’t know if anybody reads trip advisor unless you click HELPFUL. If you do this, it sends me an email and it makes me smile :-)"
Perfect place for refreshes your soul,"I really love this place, sooo much. You can reach this place by bus number 710 from Jeju Intercity Bus Terminal directly, trip around 90 minutes & pay for bus fare by T-Money. This bus route passing some attraction in Jeju, so please stop at the attraction you wants to visit. You can rent a car too. From bus stop at Seongsan Ilchulbong, you must walking around 300 meters. What i loved about this place is, so many seafood restaurants (because it really close with ocean) & some Korean cosmetics shop too. Don't forget to bring jacket, umbrella and of course mineral water. If you have strength, you can climbs the hill (around 500 meters). But so much fog when i'm there, i can't see clearly the basin. You will met some elderly people here, at the peak. Fresh air & green vegetation will makes your eyes & breath feels relieve. You can buy some souvenirs when you get back to the foothills."
Come For The Volcano. Stay For The Women Divers,"Going to Seongsan Ilchulbong and climbing to the top to see the crater is on every Jeju Island ""To Do"" list, but the best kept secret is down the mountain on the other side. In a gorgeous alcove, a handful of Jeju Haenyeo (women divers of Jeju) serves freshly caught mollusks in between diving and offering prayers of safety and a bountiful harvest. Some of these women are in their 80s and it is a very moving thing to experience. There are two shows daily 1:30 pm and 3:30 pm. It's free, although I suggest supporting these dynamic women by having some Makgeolli and a snack. The view is spectacular and so is the company."
A way to the top of the world,"The view is breathtaking. A must place to visit while in Jeju, i’m coming in a spring time, the weather was cool, yet so windy."
Fairly easy climb,"Excellent views on the top, fairly easy hike up less than 30 mins. other than the summer season which can be extremely hot, it can get very windy so do keep warm "
Worth the climb,"We came here early in the morning (5:30am) and began the hike up. It seems to be free admission before sunrise. Unfortunately, we did not see the sun rising from the ocean perhaps it was because of the fog. The sky just became brighter and brighter. We just took some photos and descended. On the way down, the sun finally made its appearance. Beautiful! There is also a women divers place below close to the coast. Cafes like Paris Baguette, isaac toast and dunkin' donuts are just nearby the parking lot. "
Scenic view,"A must visit. The view is really breathtaking and you will find the climb for 180m worth all the tired walk. We came here early morning, less tourist and the sunshine just suit the mood with windy weather. "
Sunset View is also great,"Lovely view even at sunset with manageable climb up. Down hill steps are new, even and better. Wished uphill can also be nicely renovated. Recommend a visit "
Breathtaking and worth it to go,"We start our journey from Hotel Fine at 5 am in the morning and manage to arrived there at 6 am. Please bear in mind that you are required to climb a high numbers of stairs so at least make sure you had a breakfast first. The effort of climbing the numerous stairs is really worth it as once you reached the top, the scenery are breathtaking and amazed me on each second I blink my eyes. This is a must visit place when you are at Jeju."
You will not regret visiting this place,Now I know why this place is a place to visit in Jeju. You can see the amazing natural beauty here. But you have to prepare your energy if you want to climb to the top. There are many restaurants in this place so you don't have to worry if you are starving or thirsty. You will not regret visiting this place.
Worth the climb,"Spend at least 2 hours here. Worth the climb. Beautiful scenery. If you bring kids or older adults, it’s worth the walk at the ground level and also to the sea. "
Spot for Sunset,"We want to get sunset view thus we go up at 6PM after back from Udo Island. Be prepare to climb up stairs and I mean lots of it. Have few places to stop, rest and see the sun set down. The view from top is awesome. Do carry bottle of water up as there's only 1 stall selling water when you climb around 10 to 15min. Once you pass the water selling stall, the stair steps is getting harder to climb."
Ready to exercise,"This is one of the new world wonders and indeed it's a beautiful mountain with flights of stairs to climb. It's a good exercise as the weather was nice and breezy. The bird eye view was great but the peak, to me, was a bit disappointing. "
Very nice view with win and beach,It very beauty place in the jejudo. If you go up the top of mountain where you can see all of the jeju do and can see the sunrise. But if you have many times the best recomended for you should go out and biking or trecking around the beach streets. It so better than by car...
Beauty on Top,"Seongsan Ilchulbong is one of the best view I have ever seen in my entire life. The place is an epitome of beauty and calmness despite being flocked by tourists. It is very worthy of your time, effort and energy. Trek it to experience and see its beauty. There are plenty of activities being offered on site such as horse back riding, see a Jeju woman diver and even a tour around the area through boat. We were very interested with the boat ride unfortunately we did not have the luxury of time. if given the chance to go back to Jeju I will surely comeback here and try the boat ride as well as other activities offered. Moreover, the site has plenty of coffee shops and cafes around the area. There are also stalls selling Korean street food. It has huge parking area so get ready to walk from the parking area to the site. This site entails a lot of walking but because of its beauty and being windy you can never feel fatigue."
Be prepared for alot of steps,We went up with normal sports shoes. It was okay. The view from every angle was beautiful and the scenic view from the top was very nice. 
"Breathtaking view, totally worth hike to the top! ","Seongsan Ilchulbong is certainly the top scenic spot in Jeju island. It’s basically a crater formed from volcanic eruptions, so it’s definitely has geological phenomena associated on top of being scenic. We drove from Jeju city to Seongsan for about an hour. There’s ample parking spots and entry fee is only 2000 KRW. Hiking involves climbing lot of stairs and takes about an hour to the top. We had a 2 year old with us and we could easily pick her and go to the top. I recommend carrying water and small snack items for energy. View from the top is very beautiful and obviously you see the crater when you reach the top. I think it’s top 3 spots to visit in Jeju Island and definitely a must if the weather is nice. Bonus if you during sunrise or sunset!! There are coffee shops (starbucks, McDonald, Paris Baguette etc.) and some local souvenir shop at the entrance. Enjoy"
Will back again without tours,"I regret that i should come to this place with a tour. I just have 1 hour here so i couldn't explore more about this place. A view is stunning, taking so much picture here. "
Nice view after some exercise!,Recommend ~3 hrs. It was a relaxing hike up the stairs. Very easily accessible via public bus. Beautiful environment for nature lovers. Recommend to come here after udo island trip.
Beautiful Scenery with a stunning view.,"The view was stunning and the crater is large and definitely a great place to take photos. Before you start hiking, i advice you should bring a bottle of drinking water, because there's no stores that sell one near the peak. A windbreaker or double layer clothes are useful, coz the wind was pretty strong. I sweated a lot. But reaching the top will pay all physical efforts!Last but not least, Keep your trash to yourself. Trash disposal bins are very rare. i Highly recommend this place.!"
We use Waze to drive here ,"Came here after lunch nearby , ample parking space , restaurant, cafe , beauty shops near the parking area . Need to buy tickets to enter , it was a cold & windy day . No haenyo show on that day , the view was breathtaking. Huffing & puffing all the way up the stairs . "
Prepare your leg for a climbing ^^ great view,"This amazing landscape is a must place to go when you visit Jeju. You have to climb up to see the creater and do not worries, just prepare you leg for a stairs (a lot of stairs hahaha). You better wear a comfortable shoes. when i came was sunny, temperature around 18C but the wind was strong, it makes my hair messy & runny nose (prepare face masker will help). The scenery along the way was refreshing & amazing, you will not disapointed."
Steel walk is rewarded by spectacular views,"A short but steep walk is rewarded with a spectacular view of the crater, ocean and the surrounding parts of the island. Very special to have the opportunity to visit such a special geological site. Informative signs along the trail help to educate visitors about the formation of the volcano."
Worth the climb! Sunrise Peak! ,"One of Jeju's UNESCO World Heritage. Must visit when in the island... I know its really hard ro climb, but when you get at the peak, all worth it. You dont have to worry if you get tired going to the peak coz theres a chair every level to get rest. Going down from the peak was so breathtaking. Overlooking seogwipo. A must and worth visit! "
Worth to come,We came on Feb... It's sunny and so windy there when we came... But it's a worth to come... A long walking to the peak but got a great scenery when we arrived at the peak... Go down the cliff throught the stairs and you can see many Haenyeo selling abalones and they also can cook it for you after you pay it... Don't forget to bargain it... But you must speak in Korean because they cannot speak English lor... Hohohoh... 
Beautiful View,"Visited during Jan, weather is cooling and is just nice for walking up to the peak. It takes some energy and time to get to the top, it wasn’t too difficult as there are many places you can stop and rest before you continue to the top. Very nice view, should take some time to enjoy the area instead of rushing to the next destination."
Nice tracking place,"Highly recomended going around sunset. Way up probably takes 40 minutes, if not too rushing. It is very beautiful view from top, and nice photos) Watching sunset from top was extra bonus )"
Very beautiful scenery ,The view is fantastic. It’s really cold during winter. I would suggest come to visit during spring or autumn.
One of the must visit sightseeing of Jeju,"This place is easily accessible by bus. I took bus 201 from the old bus terminal in Seogwipo City and it took about more than an hour to get to Seongsan Ilchulbong. After you get off at Ilchulbong entrance station, walk right into the small alley and continue straight until the end to the Main Street, you will see sign leading to Ilchulbong. It was a nice hike but a lot of stairs. The view is beautiful up at the top. There are plenty rest stop along the way so no need to worry. When you come down, you can go to the beach where you’ll find the house of women divers. There are performances at certain time slot but since I visited in the winter, there was none. They also sell fresh seafood where you can have right at the restaurant. It was quite expensive but It’s fresh and also to support the women divers. "
Nice views from the top,"Lots of steps but there are plenty of places to rest along the way. Probably prettier to visit in Spring or Fall. It was a cold, gray and windy day, though the sun did come thru a little. The Haenyeo, lady divers performance at 13:30 and 15:00 is very good and we enjoyed eating some of their very fresh catch! Easy to get to by public transportation but takes a long time. Easier if you have a car."
Beautiful view at the top makes it worth the climb,"Even though it was autumn when i visited, the sun was glaring. It was quite tiring to climb the stairs all the way up to the top but totally worth it! The view along the way up and the view of the town and island from the top is magnificent even though the top was just kind like a crater. Very important to be in good comfortable shoes.Will gladly climb again, hopefully this time i get there in time for sunrise or sunset."
Beautiful Landscape,"If you stayed in Seogwipo, just go to the bus terminal and ask the local there or to the tourist information inside the terminal which bus route to get in.The trip from Seogwipo take about 1 hour and 40 minutes with little traffic and several bus stops.On arrival you will see right away the remarkable Seongsan rocky mountain, really beautiful.The admission is only 4.000 Won for two people.You can easily climb to get to the top as the trail is well maintained with a good step stairs and get a good pictures while you’re on your way up. If you’re lucky, you may catch the women diver show and there’s a trail down to the rocky beachside to ride a boat."
Great Place.. A must go !!,"It is very interesting place, amazing. However if you wanna reach the top, you will have to put effort to go there."
Stairs and good view,"A lot of stairs to take, so wear the correct shoes. It would take up to 20 minutes to go up. There are spots to take a rest. View from the top is cool, natural. You would take around 20 minutes on top. Going down is from a different set of stairs. Too many tourists around you :-) something must visit in Jeju."
Best place of Jeju,"Needless to say that thousands of mainly local toursts want to see the place. Extint volcano. At the waterfront you can see a show of the so called Haenyeo, more than old women that dive in their black suits for octopus, clams etc. At the visitor center you should try perfect icecream made from peanuts or tangerines. Tangerines are cultivated quite often on Jeju."
Wonderful place,"Really love this place. You can see the diver performance. Amazing view from the top with fresh air, i would love to come back to this place again."
Worth the climb!,"I visited this place with my family, my parents are seniors. Costs 2,000 won per person. The stairs were ok for me to climb, but will be more challenging for seniors. It’s approximately 40++ floor climb (based on my watch tracking) and takes around 20++ minutes of brisk climbing to reach the top. The uneven stone flooring in certain areas can be a little tricky to climb. The views were more beautiful halfway, rather than the top. Different paths for ascending and descending so the foot traffic is smooth. The view from the peak was slightly obscured by rocks and the fence, but there’s binoculars available for use for 500 won. We visited this location close to sunset, but the view was amazing nevertheless. Surrounding the area is a lot of eateries, and there’s washroom etc nearby (important in winter :) ). Ample FOC parking spots available."
Nice view~,"Another UNESCO World Heritage. It have a nice view from the top but you need to climb up the stairs. Perhaps is a good exercise. :) You may bring along the bottled water as it takes around 30 mins to the top. There have restaurants, coffee shops, food stalls, souvenir stalls at the bottom and free car park as well."
Very nice 360deg view at the top!!!,"Early Morning walk is rather cold and its indeed extremely tiring to walk up the stairs to the top. But the view at the top is so beautiful, the sea water surrounding very crystal clear. Its a must go attraction."
Amazing view from the top,"A hike to the top is quite challenging especially for the elderly and family with young children as there are heaps of steps. Make sure to bring something to hydrate you as there were no drinking fountains available on your way to the top. Enjoy the views of the sea and cityscape once you're at the top. Also, there are a number of restaurants, coffee shops and food stalls at the bottom of the peak."
Incredible,"We got there just before dawn and it was a 20-minute hike to the top.Once we got there, we were surprised to see that there were loads of other people there to enjoy the sunrise. There's nothing blocking your view as you see the sun rise in the horizon, as if behind the sea. Absolutely must-see if you're in Jeju!"
Very chilly & windy weather ,Here you will witness lots of high waves.... it is scary also to see waves so close to you & so high. Beautiful place though to see sunset or sunrise. 
Quite a steep hike but the views are fantastic,"I had read a few reviews of this attraction before hand, but nothing had prepared me for the hike that you have to go through to get to the top. The climb is moderately steep - there are heaps of steps. Though doable, it may be quite challenging/tiring for the more elderly and very young. Making it to the top is a reward in itself - views of the sea and landscape are beautiful."
Underwhelming on Drizzly Day,"It was a gray drizzly day, slightly foggy too. Not the right weather to visit Seongsan Ilchulbong. The views at the peak were underwhelming, and not worth the hike up."
Stunning view from the top of the mountain,"I'd strongly suggest to climb up the mountain peak, Absolutely amazing view. I'm not too sure if its too hot in Summer, but when we came here it was in winter. We (together with my 8 years old daughter) climbed to the peak and it took us around 20 minutes to reached the highest point.If you are here around before 15:30, they have grandma diver performance. It is amazing to witness those old women dived into the sea without tank, only googles. They have been included into UNESCO cultural heritage list."
What a view,"My friends and I didn't expect much when we headed out here. We thought it would be a short hike but we were in for a surprise. From the moment we got out of our car, the view of the ilchulbong was breathtaking. After a short 10-20? minute hike, we took a pause at the peak to take in the grand view in front of us. I believe this is the #1 attraction of Jeju island."
Sunrise Peak for sunrise,Managed to reach there before sunrise and climbed up the mountain in about 25 minutes. The wind was real strong up at the peak and it was very very cold but it was worth every effort. The scene is amazing even though it is my second time here. 
Quick and beautiful ,"The hike is very picturesque, it's not very steep or in any way difficult. The view is amazingly beautiful, the caldera overlooking the water and even the stairs add to the amazing look of the place (I usually prefer natural hiking trails). It is not very big though, so it takes little time to hike up and down, so it's better to plan something to do in the neighborhood and not come just to see this place, as it might not be satisfying on its own."
MUST GO,"Must walk..hike to the top. Worth to go..because the nice scenery. Not suitable for old people & wheelchair. Really a huge place. Actually is a die volcano. But really beautiful.. when you on top the hill. Definate you wont regret . But must have a good stamina. Certain hour, there is a woman diver show. Quite interesting."
BEST HIKING TRACK FOR BEGINNER!,"This place was soo dope! Take note that it was so nice to visit this place around sunrise so it was a good decision that we stay near the sunrise peak! Our airbnb owner was driving us to the sunrise peak 30 minutes before the sunrise. As a beginner, the track was good and a nice hiking for us. Definitely a must visit when you stay at Jeju Island. Note that, bring your hiking shoes and hiking outfit! If you come in the morning, you cant see the woman diver show or take a boat around, but it was nice!"
Nice to hike in the afternoon,I've been here 3 times already. my latest visit is last Oct 2017 to accompany my friends. I love the scenery.
Excellent climb and views,"You have to climb up quite a bit of stairs to get to the top but it is surely worth it when you see the crater and the ocean beyond! We arrived at 3 o'clock and was unaware that the women fisherman show was also at three by the time we had climbed to the top and back down we were 45 minutes late :-(. Be sure to walk out to the lookout of Udo island, gorgeous!"
Well worth a visit!,Oh my GOD!! The hiking to the top was a BIG challenge for just an average walker.... You definitely need to be fit to be able to hike with an ease... as the name suggests it is a hike to the peak! The trail was very well built with stairs and was well supported with a railing all the way to the top. I was certainly glad that I nearly killed myself to get to the top!
Go at Sunrise,"Excellent view especially at sunrise. Hiking was good for a beginner level. Many places to stop and take a rest if needed. If not an experienced hiker, it takes maybe 40 minutes to get up to the top. No entrance fee if you go super early. Lots of lovely places around to grab coffee or some food after you hike down as well. I would do this again in a heartbeat!"
Worth all the steps!,"Ilchulbong is a huge rock/volcano/crater on the North East of Jeju Island. At first it seems a little daunting when you pull into the carpark as it looks really huge and steep. Yes, there are a lot of steps, but there are plenty of places to pause or sit for a rest and once you get to the top there's a great sitting/viewing platform. The views are really spectacular in all directions and you can see all over the mountain. It's really worth a visit if ou are going to Jeju."
Amazing scenery,"A beautiful wild landscape worth visiting! If you are lucky, you may also see the women divers that Jeju island is very famous for :) "
Bad timing but great view,We were there in a bad timing when it was raining hard so we opted not to proceed for fear of slipping or whatnot but I have seen pretty good shots of the view from the peak. I heard the climb can be challenging too.
Great sunrise ,"It's a bit of a climb to get to the top, which is mostly stairs. Once the stairs start they don't stop until the top. By this I mean there are no real breathers in between the flights of stairs and when you're on a schedule - getting to the top before sunrise, the climb can take a bit out of you. Plan for about 30 minutes or less for the healthy folk and 40 minutes or more for those of us who aren't from the parking lot.Also didn't pay entrance fees as there's no one there at sunrise."
Great view!,An easy 20 minute climb to one of the best view points on the island of Jeju. Slightly steep but easily doable for anyone in decent shape. My 74 year old uncle had no problem hiking the steps..just go slow and enjoy the spectacular views.
Tiring climb to a peaceful peak,Started our trek at around 5:50am for the 6:50am sunrise and we reached the peak at around 6:20am. So many steps... for a person who hasn't been jogging often this climb was tiring! There are wet wooden bleachers at the peak for folks to sit on and await the sun to rise. Many locals head up and will exclaim when the rising red sun appears.The descend starts getting tiring again near later half of route... very peaceful and wonderful view of Jeju at the top.
"Exciting Excursion, but Not Mandatory","My wife and I visited the sunrise mountain on our recent visit to Jeju Island. Reviews had essentially undersold me on how strenuous the climb would be - it was a workout! Took a proper 30 min of intense stair climbing to reach the top. The views at the top were great, although the ""crater"" itself is just not that photogenic. It's a big green area. There's clearly a big appeal to seeing the sunrise but we didn't make that early morning trek.Don't miss the side paths toward the female cliff divers. Offered some of the coolest views with the bay and the mountain.Overall, I thought it was really pretty and worth a visit but not necessarily mandatory if you're just in Jeju for relaxing."
Explore Jeju Island,Magnificent views even I only managed to climb half way. Here you can see people mountain people sea. Young and old. No wonder it's declared as another 7 Wonders of heritage of South Korea. A very worthy place to visit. 
Very nice but too many tourists,"You can reach Ilchulbong by bus from the Intercity bus Terminal in Jeju-Si. It takes around 1h30 to reach it. You don't really care if it is an express or intercity bus you are taking, they more or less all go at the same speed... which is quite fast. You can't really miss the stop which is quite close to the crater. Dozens of buses parked in front of the mountain kind of spoil the nice atmosphere of the place but remember you are a tourist as well... Left to the entrance, their is a nice small temple, worth the look. The climbing to the top is all made of wooden stairs and doesn't take too long (don't remember exactly, around 30 min). We did it with kids (youngest is 6) and she could do it easily. The view from the top is nice. It is a bit disappointing not to be allowed to walk around the crater. You can just see it from a platform. Before (or after) climbing, don't forget to take a look at the beach on the left of Ilchulbong specially between 13:00 and 15:00 when the old women divers are fishing."
Must visit in Jeju island,Climb up to the peak of the hill and you’ll get a fantastic view from the peak. Make sure you bring along a jacket with you as the wind is quite strong (the wind js strong during my visit).
Seongsan Ilchulbong,"Getting to the crater was after a 20 minutes steep climb upwards via a rocky road made up of bumpy rocks. The steps got smaller, higher and steeper as you move higher up the crater. The view was amazing as you climb, and was breathtaking when you get to the top. The timing of the sunrise varies daily but the top may get a little crowded, so it’s advisable to climb up a little earlier to secure a good position. The way down was via another route, but this time, with proper stairway. It leads to another cliff of the just at the side of the bottom of the crater. You can either take the stairs down the cliff to the bottom where it’s closer to the seashore or you may go up the cliff and then make your way back to the entrance."
Very beautiful,"This place was one of the prettiest places I've been so far! The ticket wasn't expensive, the price was actually very good, most of the people could pay more for it. The stairs up was very safety and the whole place was very clean also. Views was breathtaking! "
Supposedly the gem of jeju,we arrive here to herds and herds of tourist. It was quite a turn off to see from a distant the beeline of people ascending the steps so we decided to skip the hike and instead chill at the cafe nearby.
THE place to visit in jeju,"This is the thing you should visit when you are in jejuto go up and down it takes 1h, not too difficult but good enough to make you tired!the view is amazing at the top, bring your own water cose it can be really there is a beach on the righ side at the bottom when you go down, some grand ma are selling fish down the beach, nobody are there"
Nice view from the peak,"it was a pleasant hike..some rain showers but the trail is not slippery, reaching the top and seeing the views will compensate the climbing and i love the fresh air. Binocular is also available for a 500coin krw "
Wonderful ,Excellent visit to this world heritage site. It is easy to get to by bus and the signage also guides you toward the entrance. It is unexpectedly cheap and there are lots of things to do and see. There are also many restaurants to choose from in the area. 
Quarter-Day in the fall,"We drove over to Sunrise Peak on a rainy, windy day in October and knew that we would be back the following day when the rain was supposed to be gone. Thank goodness, we came back, it would have been a miserable and somewhat dangerous hike in the rain. The ticket for the hike was less than $4 USD for two adults. The hike is full of stone stairs, and if you follow the signs (please follow the signs, don't be that person) there are plenty of places to stop, rest, and enjoy the view. At the halfway point, there is even a small shop with drinks and a souvenir stand that will char a wood sign for you with your name. When we got to the top, and enjoyed the clear, clean skies (so different from Seoul) we could watch the fishing boats and could even see some of the Women Divers of Jeju at the bottom. My suggestion is to get there early, the trails opened at 0730 and enjoy your hike. The bus tours and most other Korean tourists won't be out that early. Wear good shoes and comfortable clothing and bring your camera. It was a lovely sight in October. By the time we came back down after enjoying the views and watching the divers, the parking lot was starting to fill up with many bus tours. This place would still be gorgeous, but not as fun, if we would have had to share the stone stairs with 3,000 of our closest tourists."
Hike up and be rewarded with an amazing view,"Despite missing the sunrise on a gloomy drizzling day, we enjoyed our time at this attraction. In order to get some amazing view, one have to climb up the steps which isn't too steep. The view going up and going down from the other side is totally different. Highly recommend this place for nature lovers."
Lovely views,"We got here by public bus from the Manjanggul caves. It took about an hour as we had to transfer. Using the public transport is a bit of an adventure in itself. I think the bus routes have been updated lately so even some of the locals seem confused at times.We looked at the top of the peak and thought, 'no way, this looks like it'll take 2 hours to climb'. However after asking other tourists we were told it takes about 25 minutes. I was sceptical as I'm not the fastest at going up stairs.The entry fee was 2,000 krw and despite taking quite a lot of short breaks on the way up we reached the top in 20 minutes! The views were lovely.We ended up doing this around midday and it was HOT. I recommend coming here earlier or later in the day if you can when it is a bit cooler. It was rewarding to reach the top. They are selling some drinks in the way up but I recommend that you pack some water as well as a snack to eat when you enjoy the views at the top."
Awesome views from the peak... A must in Jeju,"This mountain (aka Sunrise Peak) is located to the eastern seaboard of the island and is not accessible easily if you are staying in one of the hotels in Jeju-ri (city area) in the north. You need to take public transport which can take you more than 1 hr (Blue intercity bus, flat rate 1200 W) or 50+ min by express bus (Red, flat rate 2000 W). It is advisable to put up overnight in one of the many hotels or guest houses in Seongsan itself so that you can wake up early and start your ascend to watch the sunrise.This will take about 25-40 min to climb up the well laid out steps if you do not stop along the way to take pictures. However it is advisable to stop along the numerous rest areas and take your own time to ascend. Certain parts can be quite steep so come with a good pair of canvas sneakers or hiking shoes, sunglasses, sun screen, bottles of water. The climb up is worth the effort as you will be rewarded with the fantastic views from the peak. Going down is much easier and you can stop at the foothill to watch the women divers putting up a demo at 1.30 pm and 3 pm. At the foothill is a public toilet and a McDonald and cafe apart from stalls selling souvenirs and cold drinks."
The spot to view the sunrise,For those who can get up early and it's amazing. The local tourism board also arrange an annual 2-day party on 31 Dec and 1 Jan where you find interesting booths for travellers of all ages which I happened to be there 2 years ago.
A speculator view,"The mountain is rather easier to go, need not much effort unless you are old. But I heard some young ladies were quite dyspnoea. May be we needed more exercise to get better health. I went up around 1pm, and haven't enjoyed the sunrise view.It should be good to stay with the sun going up in the sky."
sea woman and pony riding inside,"The sea woman's show and horse riding beach are all inside the park.Climb up takes 20 min. Then you are at the edge of the volcano.Must go place beautiful volcano peak.you can hear sea woman sing and eat their harvest. you can ride pony along the seashore.As you know, every scenery place cost 2,000."
Worth the climb!,"Our visit was in the second week of September recently. It's quite an experience for both of us who are above 55yrs of age but nevertheless, we managed to reach the top! The view is so exhilarating and beautiful! Spend time taking photos and enjoy the cool breeze! You will not regret it even though the next day our calf muscles were sore!"
Pleasant hike,"Pleasant hike with young children, remember your water it was very hot on a mid august afternoon. Not too difficult a walk a few steps but enough photo shots to break it up for the kids. The view from the to is excellent out over the crater , to udo and remember to look at the pyroclastic cones behind you on the mainland. Don't forget the temple at the bottom in the car park worth a look."
A MUST GO in Jeju,"Seongsan Ilchulbong, the ‘Sunrise Peak’ Peak rose from under the sea in a volcanic eruption over 100,000 years ago.The view is breathtaking, took about 30~40 minutes up to the peak, its definitely worth it. Prepare your camera."
Tired but worth with the beauty from top,"This place is new of 7 wonders by UNESCO. There are a lot of place for you to take a beautiful pictures with the view mountain, ocean and city. They call this place s sunrise peak, you can check the schedule of sunrise in the stones in the front gate. You can buy a ticket around KRW 2,000 to enter. Then you can climb the mountain with hundreds of stairs (I didn't count it). Prepare yourself before climbing, better take a bottle of water. There are a view rest area while you climb the stairs. At the top you can see the very beautiful landscape. It's worth dude! "
One of the most visited spots in Jeju,"Seongsan Ilchulbong or sunrise peak is one of the most visited spots in Jeju. We took a public bus here from port after visiting Udo Island. Lucky it is near the port as it was already late afternoon when we reached here. The parking lot was crowded with tour coaches and and you could see the crowd climbing up and down the peak. There was a well laid path which was fairly wide with steps leading up and separate steps leading down. Certain parts had narrower steps and you have to slow down. Although the peak was not very high, you still need to stop now and then to catch your breath as the steps were quite steep. As usual, wear good walking shoes and stay hydrated. The views from the top were awesome and if you come before dawn, you can catch a beautiful sunrise here. After climbing to the Udo lighthouse earlier, it was tiring to climb this peak as well but we managed. There are platforms and steps to sit on at the top to rest and relax. By the time we got a public bus back to Jeju city, it was already getting dark. You need to pay a small fee to climb up."
Worth the trip ,"We came on a hot August day by bus. It is about 2 hours from the Intercity Bus Terminal (701). There is much to see. You can climb the steep ridge to the top or go below and see some of the expert women divers. Bring a hat and a sturdy umbrella. This is a stunning natural landmark and one of the rather unspoiled places on Jeju Island, which is crawling with unnecessary development."
"View of Tombolo, Crater and Cliffs","Our family went there after watching sunrise in nearby beach, where we could shot sunrise with Seongsan on the background. It took about 30 mins for us to climb up to the top by the rather steep staircase, the higher we walked, we saw the full picture of the tombolo and its neigbour. Up to the top, which is a narrow path and watching performs, we saw the view of the 'crater"", cliffs and the ocean. As we arrived early, there were not many people, we enjoy the quiet and time to camera, but when we walked down, we saw the full load of coach, and group of tourist."
Wonderful and high,"You will need good shoes and ~20 min, and water, the rout is amazing, clean, safe and view is breathtaking, on the way back you can buy tangerine juice form the shops - delicious!"
Great view of nature!,"We went sometime March so the weather was a bit cold and the wind was strong since the mountain is near the ocean. Suggest to wear something warm and put on comfortable shoes for the hike. There are also cafes (Starbucks, etc.) and shops (Faceshop, local souvenir shops, etc.) by the entrance."
Seongsan Ilchulbong : : Climb of a lonely traveller,"I got 28 hour spare time before my flight to Dhaka in my last visit to Korea. When I got this break at the very last moment, I searched Jeju air ticket and hotel booking online without any delay. As I purchased it at the last moment, I had to spend USD 125 more for air ticket and hotel booking. Jeju is a rush destination in summer. It's is a fairly large island to cover within 24 hours. Thanks to TripAdvisor and reviewers for helping me to select Seongsan Ilchulbong and Hamdaeok beach from many other attractions.Tourists have time, usually visit Seongsan Ilchulbong before dawn to observe Sunrise. That why it is also known as Sunrise peak. As I did’t had that option in hand, I climbed it at afternoon. I took a taxi from my hotel at Hamdaeok beach and it costs around USD 28. Bus is always cheaper but I had only 20 hours left in my hand to catch my return flight. Sunrise peak entry ticket costs USD 2 for adults and USD1 for child. Most of the review I read earlier suggests it takes 20 minutes to climb on the peak but as an amateur I took roughly 40 to 45 minutes to climb. There are two wide and convenient stairway to climb on the peak. I selected the left side stairway and eventually it was a right decision. Because there is a small grocery in the midway selling soft drinks and water for those who didn't buy it from the base. As usual they charge double for each drinks but it was a life saver for me. When I came down from the other way I didn't find any shop like this. There are also a midway station if you are tired want get refreshed for a while. When I reached on the peak I was almost exhausted. The view is literally breathtaking. I was sitting there more than one hour and a half as it is so charming that made for forget everything else of life. I came down from the other stair way. The surrounding is so calm and comfortable that I stayed their until it’s dark. Tips: Try to book air ticket and hotel upfront to save cost. Rely more in internet than locals advise because there is a high chance of misleading information due to language barrier. I lost twice in the island for relying on them and lost around 3 hours of my precious time. There are halal restaurant ( Bagdad and Rajmahal) in Jeju island. 4 days are fairly enough to cover most of the attraction of Jeju. It costs total USD 400 all inclusive for me for a quick tour , however if you are two them many cost will be shared within you. If I could catch the early morning flight from Gimpo airport at 7:30 am and save three more hours to arrive Jeju island then I could go to Udo island as well. I couldn't do that because I had to come from Suwon city. So if you stay at Seoul, you can catch 7:30 morning flight comfortably."
Wonderful view!,Nothing much to say but great view!You shoud wear lightweight hiking shoes and bring water; umbrella along.Food are not allowed.You should try boating also. (10000- 20000 won per person)It is really great!
Seeing is believing..,"If you're into nature, love moderate hiking and stairs climbing, love to see sea and city thru the bird eye view, taking plenty of photos of nature formations and also selfies (or wefies), then wjy don't you go to Seongsan Ilchubong, Jeju Island, South Korea. Designated as Unesco World Heritage site, this mountain is one the best place that you can hike and feels the wind blows your hair or maybe yourself too. The combination of flat lands and also the hike to the peak gives you an unforgetable memories. With each steps you take to climb to the peak, you will encounter several break spots or photo viewing for you to stops and take photos. Half way thru to the peak, you can see the entire city below you and starting to see the seas too. Hike to the peak, you can the see majestic view of the Seongsan Ilchubong itself. To your front is wide sea and the flat land (heard that it's actually a death volcano, correct me if i'm wrong) and to your behind is the view of the city and their surrounding. Don't forget to take photo at the peak's signboard. The formation of the clouds and the sun may give you the awe moments to you, especially when it reflects to the sea surfaces. When you go down from the peak, try to look at your right. You may see people going down to feels the sea water. Mind you, sometimes the wind blows a bit strong. You need to pay for entrance and you don't like to hike to the peak, the ground is enough for you. Me and my friend, went there on Nov'15. Do try to enjoy nature at their best."
Climbing to the top ,"A fantastic view, but take it easy if you're not into exercise. It's a steep climb to the top! We climbed on a hot day and if we didn't have water we wouldn't have made it! "
Amazing place,Hello everyone! This is a must do if you are on Jeju Island. It is a TON of walking and I will not ever recommend doing it on a hot day in the middle of the day because there is very little shade. It is a hard walk up a lot of steps but some very beautiful scenery. If you do hike it bring water and some fuel bars. It won't take you very long unless you are out of shape but even then it is worth every pain to get there. Truly breathtaking.
Be ready to walk... and get amazed!,"There is a stair to reach to top to this extinct volcano. It seems easy at first but you will need to be prepared to reach its top. They put places to sit through the course.Since I was there during summer time, I sweated a lot. But reaching the top pay all physical efforts!Then you can walked down in order to see (and get enjoyed by) the friendly ladies who dive! It was nice to see that they also served the seafood they've just captured! You need to see them because they are now just a few and how knows if there will be more of them in the future.Remember 1: the presentations of this ladies happen in specific times (I got their 13:30pm presentation, so I had to walk fast up and down the volcano in order to see them)Remember 2: you should pay a ticket to get inside the park.I truly recommend you to reach both the top of the volcano and see the women divers presentation."
Great view!,"Seongsan Ilchulbong provides a great view of the city, and ocean especially if you reach the peak.It's 180m up, and steep, so if you don't have the right condition it may be hard for you to climb up.The place is also famous for the women divers performance. It starts at 1:30pm and 3:00pm if I am not mistaken.There are also nearby shops in the area you won't get hungry or thirsty.If you collect city Starbucks mugs, there's a Starbucks nearby that offer Jeju mugs, cups and tumblers."
Spectacular views,"We were there on a clouded day, which was perfect since you don't want to climb those stairs in a heatwave. Not alot of visitors, so we made plenty of pictures without any bombers. Definitely a must-see if you are in Jeju."
beautiful place & good for take 1day visit,"beautiful place & good for take 1day visit if you have time in jeju. we take off bus stop prior to entrance and take many picture at the outside of Seongsan Ilchulbong. it has a beautiful beach & flower and horses etc... after that, went inside the hill. we went to the end of cliff that has a show for haenyeo starting time was 1330 & 1530. that has a dance & sing a song before go inside the sea. first time to close view their hard duty as actually jeju still getting many haenyeo woman as i viewed that carrying the orange ball inside the sea. some near coastal and some in the middle of ocean. seem take a long time duty such a hard duty.after that we went to hill of Seongsan. good view but the summit just a half & not easy to identify. but overall view & trail was enjoyable. must see"
One of my favorites,"Definitely one of my favorite places in Jeju-do. Beutiful, worth visiting during the sunset. Beautiful view and the hike is quite easy, so good for families with kids as well."
Beautiful part of Jeju,"I went to this peak three times during my stay for a year on Jeju island! First time was in August when it was sweltering hot, so I never climbed it just took pictures from the bottom. The second time I went was in September when it was cooler and I climbed it and it only took the recommended time of 30 minutes. Such a beautiful view and the sign saying you reached the top is very nice. My last time climbing it was in December for the sunrise and my mom and I made it to the top just before sunrise but it was an overcast day so we only saw a tiny bit of pink under the clouds but still it was a nice view of Jeju from that height! Definitely recommend doing this while you are in Jeju :)"
Great view,"Great view up from the foot all the way up to the top of the peak. Took about 30 -40 mins to climb up and down.Be sure to visit the Haenyeo- woman diver at the mini beach area. You can eat live seafood- sea cucumber, octopus, abalone etc if you are brave enough."
Stunning view ,Such a beautiful place with stunning viewIt is a must visit when you come to jeju islandDon't forget to gear up with comfy shoes because you will need to hike if you want to get the best view of this placeMake sure you buy a bottled of tangerine juice because it tastes delicious
The mountain displayed on all those billboards!,We went for sunset and it was stunning. There were quite a few people but I imagine fewer than there were at sunset. Make sure to go to the black sand beach close to the mountain too. 
Beautiful place,"Although it's raining and foggy day, the view is wonderful. The sea women show is funny. Highly recommend."
Amazing Seongsan!,Awesome! to climb to the peak takes at least 1 hour in a walk and stop manner! nice view of the sea. 
Best place to visit in Jeju - Amazing!!!,Tiring but its really worth it especially when you reach the top ohhh i really love the view wonderful nature creation...
Beautiful Views,"I found this to be the best attraction in Jeju. It really is a lot of stairs, so if you are not good in health condition, this might be very tiresome. But there are rest points a long the way, so you can take your time. There are little shops and restaurants around after you finish your hike. Beautiful views to take pictures both going up and down."
Nice view,"It took a bit time (tho not much, about 15-20mins) and energy for us to get to the top of the mountain but it certainly worths. It was a bit foggy that day so cannot see sunset clearly but the sky is beautiful. Surely will come again for sunrise if I'll come here again! "
Natural Mountain Fort - Amazing Hike!,"Wow, wow, if you love to hike, this is awesome. Tons of steps. As I came up on the entrance I was expecting Khaleesi to come around the bend with the Dothraki horde. With the rain coming down I felt like I was in another world. It is a hike with lots of stairs about 180 meters but so worth it, dry or wet (with caution). I did it wet and no regrets."
Right there,This is right were we stayed and the cliffs and beautiful greenery is amazing! Highly recommend this area! 
"Nice view, nice wind","The hike was tiring as I've never hiked before. But it's worth the experience, the view and the wind!"
Great view,"It is a UNESCO world herritage, recommended to see if you go to Jeju. We need to hike around 30-45 minutes to the top to get the full view."
Nice but overcrowded,"I like the structure and set-up (the wooden boardwalk and handrails) and it looks majestic when I step past the ticket entrance. In the wide open space, it feels you have so much freedom to run around! If I had came earlier, I would have joined the Jeju Woman Diver performance (1.30pm and 3pm daily). No regrets since I headed to Udo before coming over and that was even more amazing! It requires certain level of stamina to climb up the flight of steps but fret not! There are stone chairs along the way, not many though, for you to sit and rest.The young kids and senior citizens are surprisingly the more consistent climbers up the stairs!Despite rating 4/5 due to my liking for the crater and natural structure, my actual experience there is only 2/5. There were large crowds of extremely rowdy and unruly chinese tour groups who spoke loudly at the top of their lungs, their tour guides shouting several times for them to gather and start moving down with no avail, zero consideration for other visitors who also paid the same ticket price to see this UNESCO World Heritage site. No way you can enjoy a peaceful moment and respect the site. They stood around various areas of the steps and took ages to complete their group photo. I have seen many tour groups before but the ones I encountered were horrible. It would have been good if the owner or caretaker of this site can do something to regulate and not spoil every visitor's experience at this place..."
Nice one hour hike,"My family walked from our hotel to the top of Ilchulbong and down. From the entrance, the mountain(?) looked formidable and it looked to be a painful hike, but it turned out to be rather a short hike. I wish I had taken more time on the way up and enjoyed the views more. On the way down, we saw a restaurant by the rocky shore. I believe this is where mermaids do their demonstrations and sell raw oyster dishes. I wanted to go down but my 10 & 12 yr olds won't have it. So I missed out. The guy who took the tickets at the entrance surprising had a good nack for taking pictures. If he is not too busy, ask him to take your group photo. After the hike, we went to a bakery just by the entrance. From the second floor, we had a nice view of the Ilchulbong and enjoyed cup of coffee with various breads. The owner was very kind and let us wait out the rain in the store."
The mountain and me,I am 6 years old and when I first got to sunrise peak it was really tall and big. I thought I couldn't climb it but I did. My mummy wanted to quit but I wouldn't let her. The best bit was we saw a shop that sold water and I bought juice. It was halfway up so mummy didn't need to carry water after all. I wish it wasn't such a cloudy day but the view was still cool. I saw a telescope to see everything. Me and my Brother had a fight over the telescope and mummy and daddy got mad. When we got to the top daddy said it was a crater but I did not see any lava so I think he was lying. The end. Finished. 
Amazingly beautiful ,I wasn't able to get there for sunrise but it's still so beautiful. It's quite easy to go up and down only need 30 minutes.
A must go place if you go to Jeju Island,"This place is just WOW. The views, the nature, the sea, everything. Even when it is a bit rainy or foggy, it is still a great experience. They do not let you in with any sort of snacks or food other than water, just so you know. You must try the raw seafood that the ""mermaids"" catch every morning. It is located at the bottom near the entrance. That is, if you like raw seafood. There is plenty of parking and there is even a Starbucks near by and other restaurants."
Reaching the summit! It's a haven,"Solo traveling in Jeju Island is not that scary:) Koreans living nearby this tourist spot can speak English. So I am not worried about it.It was raining that day when I reach the place. Nevertheless, still can see the view at the top.The wind blowing my hair together with the greenery grasses and leaves of trees surrounding the peak.The place is accessible by public buses so I don't have difficulty in reaching this site. Though you have to walk a few distance to reach the entrance gate.There are educational boards installed for all the tourists to read and understand the history of it.It's worth visiting this place. Entrance fee is also cheap:)I visited Unesco World Heritage!"
Sunrise Peak,Beautiful breathtaking awesome wow amazing worth getting up at 4:30 am to get to the sunrise in time! Loved it!
"We only saw it, did not hike it","We did not hike it due to lack of time & the huge crowds of people was daunting. The parking lot was chaotic. If there is one major complaint I would make about South Korea it would be that the driving here is awful. The drivers, especially the younger ones are inconsiderate, extremely aggressive & quite dangerous. There is absolutely no consideration shown to pedestrians even in clearly marked crosswalks. "
Scenic views on volcanic tuff cone heritage site,"This is one of the best scenic spots on Jeju Island and we intentionally chose to stay in Seongsan for that reason. Admission fee of ₩2000 was lifted in the month of April so there was free entry. Parking, free at all times, is plentiful in the area close to the UNESCO World Heritage entrance. The climb up the tuff cone was gradual along well-marked and well-laid pathways and steps in spite of the throngs of tourists. Do stop occasionally along the route to catch your breath and to catch the surrounding views from various altitudes. On a perfect day, one can see the blue skies against the blue seas and the township of Seongsan below. As a bonus, take the side trail to the Haenyeo or Women Divers’ House, to taste the fresh seafood like abalone and other shellfish, sliced and diced before your very eyes and served with kimchi and seaweed. To finish, take a peek at the Dong Am Sa Temple near the car-park. With such a majestic location, the temple is fortunately understated and does not stick out to compete with the volcano backdrop. What an incredible place to spend half a day!"
Best place to visit in Jeju,"Took the visit for the sunset and it was pretty amazing. Nice volcano, ascension may not be top class but the view at the top is superb. Views of the crater from far away are nice too. A must on Jeju island. "
Never regret visiting the place,"Am glad able to get into the Peak just before its closing for ticket sales, you will regret not visiting it. Though windy & cold during night time, it's worth for all the climbing to see the sunset… at least for me "
nice view from top,"take about 15-30 minutes stairs-hike, depends on ur physical fitness. it's pretty easy hike.view from top was breathtaking, u can see udo island from top of this hill, sadly i missed a chance to see it on sunrise/sunset (a lot of people say this is the best place to see it)"
Sunrise or sunset both are great! ,"Although this place is called a sunrise peak, its even better in sunset! Managed to run up the hundreds of steps in about 30min to catch the sunset, but totally worth it as the views are amazing! Might need a bit of physical fitness but I have seen old ahjummas climb up as well, so just keep climbinh and do not give up. "
Best attraction on Jeju,If you go to Jeju then you must go here. The view is absolutely amazing. Don't worry about trying to make it for Sunrise. Just go. You will not be disappointed. The climb to the top is not too difficult and is very manageable. I recommend riding the jet boats when you come back down.
Nice short hike,"Took bus 701 from Seogwipo (around 1hr20mins) to Seongsan IIchulbong entrance station. The bus doesn't exactly stop at the entrance, but you can see the crater from the station. Just walk towards it. A big innisfree building is where the entrance is. The wind was pretty strong on the day that I went, so it was a good thing I brought my windbreaker. I suppose on less windy days, it's not that cold as many were in shorts and t-shirt. ie, they weren't prepared for the wind and were shivering. It is a relatively easy hike up, proper steps and handrails (many elderly made it up there slowly, taking multiple breaks on the way). But if you are fit, half an hour should be sufficient for you to reach the top. For this short hike, the view is totally worth it. "
Absolute gem of natural wonder,"Do not miss the climb to the crater, absolutely incredible natural wonder and terrific views. 650 steps up following a hill climb but we'll worth it. Stunning"
Pretty relaxing,If you are looking for some exercise and mountain climbing that is manageable and has good view (no blockage). I think this place is good to visitThe footpaths are properly laid but there are some steps that are pretty steep. So be careful. Parking is free at the venueLots of food around the location as well.
Natue at it's best,What a beautiful place! You can take a hike to the peak or watch the female divers. It is a definite must do!
Great views all around ,"Remember to wear sunscreen, we went on a sunny day and I got a few shades darker walking to the top. Get ready for lots of stairs and a thigh workout, I was a sweaty mess by the time I reached the top, but let me tell you the views were worth it! Gorgeous! "
One of must-visit attraction in Jeju,"This's one of the must-visit attraction in Jeju, also one of 7 new wonder of the world. It worth to climb up all stairs as you can see so beautiful scenes with mountain and the ocean, especially when you reach the peak, along with amazing trails like you often seen in Korean drama. we spent around 3hrs here, mostly for taking photo, then had lunch at Mc.Donald at the entrance of Seongsan.Admission fee is 2000w/pax. we got here by intercity bus no. 710 (East side) from jeju bus terminal and #710-1 on the way back. it took about 1hr 10 mins"
Beautiful peak,"Went in the evening, the wind was very strong as we climb to the top. Amazing sceneries, worthy to climb up. The climb is fun, not difficult. There are many shops nearby the entrance, prices varies for the same product so it's better to compare prices before buying."
An expirience,A walking up a hill with edition of about eight hundred steps which give you a beautiful view on the eastern coast of the island. Areal nice chalenge. 
Trip up Jeju's famous crater,"The paths up and down the crater are well-maintained with hand-rails and steps to minimize slips and falls. The views from the peak are extremely scenic looking down at the blue sea water and misty 1950-m highHallasan far in the midst of the island. A left path leads to the cliff-bay where fresh seafood is available to prepare as you order and motor boat-rides at 10,000 per person are available."
Beautiful Scenery,"It is easy to get on the top. The view was stunning and the crater is large and definitely a great place to take photos. The way going upwards is slightly steep but the way down is much gentle and has a much better view. Besides, the walking trail heading to the coast can have the best view of the whole coastline and hill."
Nice to see but crowded,It is definitely a cool place to see and take a picture of (not crazy if you visited Scotland or Tasmania but cool nevertheless). The amount of people off season was a no go for me to pay the fee and go up on it. Two pictures from the road or the cape and good to go
Must-go attraction of Jeju-Island,"An amazing scenic spot with stunning view. Try to hike along the trail for panoramic view of jeju island and the ocean. If you have limited time, it is not necessary to hike up the peak since the best scenery is blocked by the fences. The descending path has much better scenery that the ascending one! p.s. Try out the hanrabong ice-cream! One of the best way to recharge after hiking"
Better at night,"This hill looks rather spectacular from a distance and the approach to its foot is thru a pretty green field. The pathway is well maintained and it's an easy hike up to the top, at only 180 meters. It's mostly a broad stairway to the top and makes for a pleasant evening walk. At the peak it would be a great place to watch the stars on a clear moonless night. Admission is free after ""closing time"" -- there's no gate."
Better understand what you're going to see before getting there,"It wasn't very clear from the guide books. The spot is basically a volcanic rock formation that is concave. I'm not sure that you can actually have a good view of the formation with its lush green centre from any walkable vantage point (like you get from travel books). So on nearing the spot, stop on the highway shoulder to get a distant photograph first.After you arrive, note that the car park is basically one way. Miss a turn and you have to exit the carpark and come back from the entrance. Be prepared to walk / hike as the areas open to public are quite steep. You can get a good open view of the city or the ocean. Refreshing scenery."
"Offers a fanstic view, if you're lucky","In my first visit there, it was very foggy and I couldn't see nothing; it was just an exercise (a not that hard one).But this time I was very lucky: it was a very fine day with little cloud and its view was fantastic. You should definitely climb it and see it for yourself, but check the local weather before and choose the day wisely.Climbing it wasn't that hard for my mother-in-law in her late 60s and my preteen daughter. But you should bring a bottle of drinking water or two with you as there's no stores that sell one near the peak (you can buy them at the CVS store in front of the gate)."
Require strong physical condition,"I admit that i lack of exercise, i keep thinking of giving up after completing 20% of the total course(at the entrance, there is a signboard saying that the whole course just needed 50 min). It is very tiring so please be prepared. Anyhow, it took me 80 min to complete the course. The view at the top is nice, i guess if you come for sunrise, it will be very impressive. Not suitable for those who are physically weak."
Next time we'll go to the top!,"This was the last stop on Day 2 of our South Korea Tour after four previous destinations. By that time we had walked and walked and walked so much that we barely made it to the fork in the path that leads either to the top of the volcano or down to the sea shore. We took the path down to the shoreline and waited until we got enough energy to climb back up.Whichever way you choose the views are literally breathtaking LOL. Wear shoes sensible for hiking. Sometimes the paths are rocky and steep. Also wear layered clothing as the effort of the climb up/down will cause you to sweat and the wind will cool you off very quickly. A windbreaker is useful. Always bring a cane style umbrella. Even if you don't need shelter from rain or sun, you can always use it to steady you on your hike.Take a lot of photos and keep your trash to yourself. Trash disposal bins are rare."
Nice walk,Pretty excercise to get up to hill ... 500 steps you can feel in legs but final view worth it. Do not miss this place!
beautiful views,"You can climb up to the peak, you can climb down to the beach, or just walk around in between, & still have beautiful views. You could spend most of the day here. The women divers were not diving the day we were there."
Must-see when visiting Jeju,"Formed from the eruption of a hydrovolcano, this is the most popular sight on the east coast of Jeju. Ample parking space, a reasonable admission fee and a spectacular view from the top. If you plan on going early for the sunrise, I would advise catching it from a beach just south of the outcrop rather than from the crater itself."
A Good Work Out Amidst An Amazing View ,"The one way trail to Mount Hallasan was a challenge... but we conquered it. It was a good work out as we climbed to the top. Good thing there were stations where we can rest, chit chat and laugh....We were inspired by the older people , even not in sneakers , who were able to achieve the same task with no complaints .... going down the trail was a breeze... a good cool down..... a must see in Jeju-do!!!"
Prepare for a climb.,"A must for visitors tot he island. An area of beauty, amazing geographical formations, haenyeo (diving women), shops and foods. A very steep climb to the top but the steps are well developed and there are small seats along the climb to take a break. Great views fro the top, but if the day is windy be prepared for some discomfort. Take a water bottle, camera and coat! Worth every step!"
An easy hike up with a oceanic view,"We stayed at Seowipo, near to the seogwipo-si (former) intercity bus terminal and took bus 701 to Seongsan ilchulbong. The bus journey took more than 1.5hours and cost about 3300won one way and the bus driver could provide change if needed. There was a TV screen at the front of the bus that will flash and announce the current and coming stop in english clearly. The TV screen will flash seongsan-ri entrance (I have attached the photo) and you can press the bell to alight. Just to note that the bus ride can be a nausea one as the driver usually travel at a high speed as there were many stops they need to embark on. We alighted and headed to the dark brown beach along Seongsan. Not sure why we need not need to pay for the entrance fee that day (25th April) but we were happy as the temperature was about 17 degree Celsius. We wore T-shirt with a windbreaker only as the sun kept us warm. A windbreaker will be good as it can be quite windy especially if you walk along the beach. There were 2 track at Seongsan. One track led to the peak of Seongsan which consist about 10 flights of stairs (Pretty doable even with poor fitness – just take as many rest breaks as needed). At the peak, you will be able to have a panoramic view of the city and the surrounding water bodies. The other track is along the coast area with pretty wild purple (I think is Lunaria annua) and yellow canola wild flower and volcanic stacked rocks.After Seongsan, you can continue to the Jeju Olle Route 1 to Al Oreum along the ocean area. The Jeju Olle Route 1 will pass by canola flower patches for photo taking, a nice ocean view with beaches for scenic viewing, a new hotel named as The Cloud, the ferry terminal, along many beautiful seashore where to can pick clams and walkway with dry cuttlefish along the coast. There were many restaurants along the way too. However, we started the walk at 1pm and took too many stops for picture taking. Therefore, we were unable to finish the walk to Al Oreum as we reached Jongdal Elementary school at 5.30 pm. Noted that there was no bus stop along the walk after the fish port/market to Jongdal Elementary school (there was a Ojo Haenyeo House bus stop). Therefore, make sure you start the Olle route earlier. We decide to go back as it was late by bus 701 back to the seogwipo-si (former) intercity bus terminal from Jongdal Elementary school as we noted that the bus will take about 2 hours to reach Seogwipo-si."
Good exercise...,"This is like a must-see attraction according to the reviews and the crowds there.... so despite there is nothing much to see when you reach the summit.... just some balding green on a small concave patch of land .. it is probably still worth the 20 odd minutes climb up , for health sake.. . Some cardio exercise is always good after all the black pig meals ! If you arrive at the right time at the foot of the hill, you may be lucky to catch some women divers performing there.."
Recommend to International Tourists!,"It took convos with my friends who are from Korea to find out about this (I am from New York), but man was it worth it! On a clear day this is up there with one of the prettiest sites and generally awesome vibes of anywhere I've been. You get an incredible view, a nice short ""hike"" (up the stairs), AMAZING food all around, etc. Definitely try the raw seafood caught by the diving ladies! Explore the area. I took a bus from Jeju City"
Strong wind and rain,"It was raining when we reached the place. From the parking area, you will see this beautiful crater. As we are slowly walking up the slope, the wind was too strong for us to walk further up.Decided not to go up, but must had to take a few photographs of this beautiful place with the wind, rain and waves.On Normal day, there is also diving show by the famous Sea Women - Haenyeo. Mostly are 50 and above who dive for a living.Try to plan the visit during normal weather."
Well worth the climb,"The previous review states that the climb was in 20 minutes but for a relatively unfit person like myself, it took me 30 to 40 minutes with numerous stops beginning from halfway till the top. Much to your agitation, we see older citizens and children alike happily and easily climbing the steps and overtook you to the top. Nevertheless, the view on the top was well worth the tough climb (according to my unfit status). Managed to take some photo shots of the surrounding and the crater itself. As it was just beginning spring, the crater floor was covered with brownish grass and vegetation, not the greenish color you would expect in summer. What I most remembered was the real cold buffeting wind of 2 Degrees Celsius blowing and you could really feel it even with winter jackets and caps worn while climbing the steps. But it was most memorable. Wife did not want to climb the steps but decided to go shopping for the famous Jeju orange chocolates in the shops at the foot of the park."
Great views!,"Climbing takes 20 minutes, not too strenuous. A lot of people taking selfies. The views are definitely worth a trip."
Worthwhile,"We opted to stay @ Co-Op City Hotel with seaview, cab from airport to hotel is about 40min or KRW40K.Just 10~15min stroll to reach the sunrise peak. Amazing view and we managed to catch the sunset."
"Little hike, great views",There is a parking lot for self park and that was handy. Luckily we found a spot as someone was leaving. Hiked up to the top for fabulous views. Came back down and had lunch at a local place just down the road since the car was parked in the lot we didn't want to try parking somewhere else. The local place was very good. Definitely have to go to this tourist destination if you go to Jeju 
Very recommended!,It's very very cool. The sunrise peak is a must visit place if you happen to be in Jeju. A beautiful (and easy) hike to get incredible views!
So windy!!!,"Despite the temperature being around 17 degrees Celsius Springtime end of March, we were nearly blown away the minute we got out of our car. It was super windy & cold at the base! Had to put on extra layers, wind breakers etc. However the climb up is via long, steep stairs (my nemesis!!) so had to take off some layers halfway as I wheezed & panted my way up! View from top was just okay, wasn't as green as the photos we saw. Maybe because it was early spring. On the way down, we took a detour to the Diving Women's museum / hut / restaurant just by the rocky beach. Owing to the weather, no diving woman worth her salt, was going to do a performance in the sea. We had to contend with a couple of squirmy sea creatures in tanks, which the diving women chopped up with precision & served to us with soya sauce. The abalone, octopus & shell-fish were as fresh as you could get and tough as erasers. But we did it more for the experience than the cuisine or taste. You can pick up more tasty fare at the shops near the carpark if you're hungry. "
very beautiful nature!,Really it was wonderful weather when we visited this place. Amazing view! and u will have a such a nice rest even looking at this view!
Definitely worth the effort,"Do check the sunrise forecast and depending on fitness level, allow 20 minutes to an hour to reach the peak. Very doable hike even for non-fitness enthusiasts. The stunning views along the way and at the peak will be worth every effort! On the way up, there will be a few points where you can sit and take a breather. Great activity to start off the day!"
For early sunrise view,"I think the best time to climb here is during Spring, went during Winter and couldn't see much except for nice view. It's quite high up, so make sure you're a bit fit to climb the stairs.I personally didn't go up to see the sunrise but I've heard it's an amazing experience. Do give it a shot but you did have to be there by 6am "
"Good Workout, Beautiful, Rugged Landscape","Yep, there are a lot of stairs here. It honestly wasn't as bad as I was expecting it to be, seeing as how stairs are my natural enemy. You will probably be tired when you get to the top, but little kids and elderly people are doing it, so it's not crazy. It's over a lot faster than it feels like it's going to be as you're ascending. We were there in the late afternoon, and it was a little crowded, but not too much trouble. Most people move along at a pretty good pace and don't stand in the way too much when taking pictures. It's a bit more difficult to get good pictures at the top though, because everyone stops up there to rest and take tons of photos. It's worth the climb and you'll get some good pictures out of it if the weather permits. Even if you think you are unable to go up to the top, it's worth coming out here just for the landscape."
So many steps but beautiful view from the top,You need a certain level of fitness to be able to climb the many steps to the top. Great views along the way but the view from the top is spectacular. Very popular destination so prepare for the crowds.
Beautiful views!,"This is definitely a must do on Jeju Island. Climb early in the morning to avoid the throngs of people. If the pollution is low, you'll have a great view. Beware, even if you climb early in the morning, it may not be peaceful. There will be many selfie sticks! I was expecting lush green grass and canola flowers -- it became very apparent that the online images have been Photoshopped. It is still well worth it to visit - just don't expect the view to be as stellar as what you see online."
Must go!,Woke up early hoping to catch the sunrise. We stayed at a pension just 5 min walk from the entrance to Seongsan ilchulbong. It was a wonderful experience to climb in the darkness of the predawn hour. We were surprised to see so many people waiting the start the climb when we reached it was raining the night before so the ground was rather slippery. Thankfully the rain had stopped when we started the climb. According to a local there are 500 steps to the peak. It's doable though it does require a good amount stamina / more time (we were pressed as we wanted to catch the sunrise). The route is easy to follow - steps all the way; there're toilets along the trail too. It was cloudy on the day we climbed so the sunrise wasn't as we'd hoped but still spectacular regardless. On the way down we took a short detour down a flight of steps to a lagoon-like region where the haenyeon dive for seafood. The view there is spectacular especially before the tide rises in the morning. There is a restaurant that sells seafood caught by the haenyeon that was very yummy we actually took some really nice pictures there. Would return in a heartbeat just for the refreshing climb!! 
"Nice View, Good Exercise","The wind was so strong that we can hardly move forward. But was only for certain section of the it. Once we go thro that, and reach the peak, it worth every effort to fight against the wind. Very nice view, can imagine how grateful it is to watch Sunrise at the peak. If your schedule allow it, please do so, you will not regret it."
Family with young children,Great view! Beautiful scenary of Jeju n its breathtaking though had to climb up till the top. Its cold but sunny..nice weather. A must to visit this amaxing place.
Easy & Rewarding Climb to the Top,"Seongsan Ilchulbong, or Sunrise Peak, gives you a sweeping view of Seogwipo City so don't forget to stop at different points to witness this. I love it being a tuff cone and all (even if I'm not that into geology). It's also a UNESCO World Heritage site.They say it's best to climb to the peak during sunrise (hence, the name). But it rained at dawn when I was there, so I just started out around 10 AM. The occasional drizzle did not dampen my experience. Wherever you look you'll see, breathe, and smell nature. :D There are stairs for climbing. It's a short trail. The place can become crowded, but there's a place for everyone. Take a side trip to the beach area at the bottom. The haenyeo, or Jeju women divers, perform there in the afternoon."
Must see!,"This one amazing place is a must in Jeju! We were not able to go early but I think the best time is sunrise, since it is called the ""Sunrise Peak"" in english. There's plenty of parking, restrooms and stores for food and stuffs! Nice people around and the view is fantastic! It can be a challenge to go to the top so be sure your knees will last the climb to the peak!"
Have to see,People say you should visit it as the sunrise. Too bad I was a bit late so I couldn't see the amazing view. But still even if you go later the view is amazing. If you go to the top of seongsan ilchilbong you could see the city by the sea. It's a bit tiring to go up coz there's so many stairs that you have to climb. But you get pay as you see the amazing view from the top
"So sadly, you should pay.","you can feel free on the top of the hill.(or mt.)at that time it was free, but I heard that will be changed paid.(might be already)"
Natural Wonder!!!,"Must visit place in Jeju, it is very beautiful, view is spectacular from the top. There are stairs so it is easier to climb. Give yourself 3-4 hours to explore everything."
Awesome view from the top,"Visited this place in the evening after a day trip to Udo island, which is equally nice and probably less crowded compared to morning where most locals and tourists came to catch a glimpse of the sunrise."
climb up to the top for a awesome view!,"Great view, easy to climb and a very nice place for some photos. Its best to climb it in the early morning before all the tour groups arrives."
Great Sunrise!!!,Started our hike as early as 5.30 am because we took only less than 5 minutes to walk from the guesthouse we stayed. So lucky to be able to have a perfect spot to stand and sit to enjoy our sunrise even though the place was very crowded. The view was spectacular and definitely worth the effort of hiking up to the peak!
breathtaking place,This would be my favourite place in Jeju. Evey single view is so beautiful. Too bad we went with a tour and did not have much time to explore around. We did climb up to the top though. We can easily spend half a day there. Suggest to give much time and go on your own instead of tour so you will have more time to enjoy it's nature
Tiring Hike!,I was convinced by my friend to climb and see the unesco world heritage. I was disappointed to see nothing on top. it was so tiring a climb only to see a bare area. Really nothing on top.
Seongsan Ilchulbong,"The place is usually crowded. Make sure to wear good walking shoes to walk and climb, some drinking water to quench thirst along the way. Not suitable for elderly and people who are not keen in climbing. Otherwise, is worth to visit - it is a Unesco World Heritage site after all. If you are not there to catch sunrise, any season is fine."
Worth the climb,Steep climb up the hill but the view worth every step. The stair halfway up is quite steep and a bit of a challenge if u have a bad knee. The best time to go is either for sunset or sunrise. There is only 1 shop to buy water up there. Make sure you have your water with you for the climb. 
Beautiful view and good place for hiking in Jeju Island,"About 35 - 1hr hike to reach up the hill. The view at the top is amazing, it's worth to hike. Halfway through the hike there will be 1 pit stop if you would like to purchase any drink and some resting point. There are 2 points where you can U-turn if you feel that you are unable to complete the hike. Once you miss the last turn, you have to complete it hike as it's one way direction."
Beautiful view,"I definitely recommend this place altough it's popular among tourists. Anyway, the view on the top is absolutely amazing and for me walking on the top wasn't too hard. It was very windy but sunny day (and I burned my nose) so I recommend to remember the sun lotion! Or if it's cold and windy to wear warm clothes. On the top there were many places to sit and take a brake. The journey down was also lovely because of amazing views. Before you start to walk to up remember to go to toilet and eat something (there are toilets and food in the same area). If you haven't used to walk lot of stairs it can be quite challenge but it is definitely worth of it."
Stunning view,Anyone visiting Jeju island must to do this hike.This was the highlight of my trip and i enjoyed every moment of it.Tip: try leaving your hotel by 5am or earlier to reach at the top during sunrise.Its totally worth it!!
A must-visit place when you're in Jeju,"Gorgeous view of Jeju when you reach the peak and a satisfying climb to the top. For someone who is not fit, it took me almost 45mins to hike to the peak as it was drizzling when I went there. People usually come here to catch the sunrise or sunset but it was a long drive from my guesthouse area. I also planned my timing here so that I could catch the Haenyo performance at around 1.30pm on the way down the peak. Do wear suitable shoes if you are hiking to the top as the steps get very steep as you go further up and if it rains, it's going to be very slippery. Also, do check out the weather forecast before visiting because there wouldn't be a nice view if there's fog."
Nice view of Jeju Island!,"We took the public bus from Seogwipo interchange bus terminal. It took about 90 mins to get there. This place is a tourist hot favourite after being rated as one of new 7 wonders of the world. The climb up has some hundreds of well constructed stairs, however sometimes it can be a bit crowded at the stairs with many paused to take pictures. Hill top has amazing views of it's surroundings and we saw the ferry crossing to other islands. It has a tiered lookout platform big enough to house few hundreds of people. From the platform, it's quite visible that landmark was formed due to volcanic activity history. We were told this is best location to see sun rise although we have yet to try that. Tips, going down the hill is different side to way up. We found the views on way down has much better vintage points than way up. "
Amazing view on a good day!,We went there on our way back after U-do. It offers such a gorgeous view of Jeju-do and it was a short hike - return trip of less than 1 hour. Definitely worth the hike!
Top Jeju attraction,"We woke up early and drove to Phoenix Island where Genus Loci, Seopjikoji Cape are located. We found a spot on the beach facing the Seongsan Ilchulbong and watched as the sun rises behind us. We visited Seopjikoji Lighthouse before driving over to Seongsan Peninsula.There are plenty of restaurants at the base of the Ilchulbong and we had our breakfast before heading up the crater. The climb, though steep, is fairly easy with steps and the crowd control well organized. The view was fantastic. Could be done in a leisurely 1.5 to 2 hours.Plan to wake up early, visit this place and then do the surrounding attractions nearby."
Great View,UNESCO heritage site in Jeju. Location near the restaurant that sells live abalone and woman diver. It's crowded with holidaymakers but well worth the view. There are some cafe and restaurant at the car park. Didn't catch the sunrise as we were staying at the other side of the island.
One of the 7 wonders," We visited this tourist spot because Seongsan Sunrise Peak (=Seongsan Ilchulbong) is one of the 7 wonders. Basically it's an archetypal tuff cone formed thousand of years. In this area, we can also see performance of Jeju woman diver ( too bad I did not have chance to see it myself)There was stall selling sausage and korean snack on a stick (@3K-4K won) which is yummy. Try one. *TK"
Catching the egg yolk out of the sea,"The journey up from the car park to the peak took 20mins. A bit strenuous for some people and the path near the car park is not even ground. Advise to bring torch lights, check for the sunrise time and cater more time to get to the peak. Absolutely worth the time to catch the sunrise. "
Worth the climb,"I love nature and if you do too this is a must visit if you are in jeju. A Unesco site and a new seven wonder, the view from the top is worth the climb. Depending on individual it can take up to 30 minutes to climb but take your time and enjoy the crisp air and the beautiful view of jeju. Also walk to the sea to buy life seafood caught by the locals"
Must see place when in Jeju,"One of the UNESCO heritage site in Jeju. It's located at the eastern side of Jeju. The view at the top is worth the hike, check also beach area. Taxi Fare from downtown to this place is around 40KRW and it's totally worth it. "
Speed boat ride and nice view,Took a speedboat ride of krw10k for 15mins. Fun and thrilling with a quick stop for view of seagulls and black volcano stones. Location near the restaurant that sells live abalone and woman diver.Spectacular view even when you only walk 10mins from main entrance with free telescope. Didnt managed to climb to the peak. Reached there about 2pm.
Worth the climb!,Stairs and stairs that eventually lead to the very top. It's crowded with holidaymakers but well worth the view. A very beautiful volcano and you can look right into the caldera at the peak. 
An exhilarating climb to a great sight!,"This is a Unesco site and is actually a crater. The climb for an older person like me takes about 30 mins. At the summit, you are rewarded with a view of the crater and the horizon, just simply awesome!"
Wonderful scenery,Highly recommended to come during sunrise and/or sunset - absolutely gorgeous scenery and wonderful air. Also has a lot of good food and convenience stores in the area. Only downside is that it can get quite crowded.
Wonderful view,"Woke up early for this trip but only managed to reach there at 8am. Drove 1 hour plus from Seogwipo but it was worth it. The climb was torturous as the path was made of uneven rocks. There will be stairs further up the climb. it made me sweat even thou the temperature was below 10 deg. The view was amazing and when you reached the top, you forget all your problems and worries. You can see the whole outline of Jeju Island from here. Its a wonderful sight. A must go to place."
Beautiful at top,Love hiking. Challenges with lots narrow steps ... but is all worth it. Beautiful sunset waiting us at top. Wonderful world. 
Seongsan Mountain !,"By the time we reached Seongsan mountain, it's already 3.30 pm! On reaching there, and by the look at the mountain, it seems as if there's nothing to enjoy but after my daughter stated that it's world wide attraction, I reluctantly followed them up the 274 meter high mountain with unbelievable thought!But after going uphill, I have another thought!On looking down as I rested after some stairs, the beautiful scenery blaff me! Then as we climbed up stairs after stairs, we took lots of pictures. By the time we reached the top which is the most and satisfying view of sceneries surrounding all sides! I took only a few mountain top scenery because my camera's battery was flat! I sat on top of the mountain and look down at the serenity scene of parts of Jeju Island with the blending on sun setting! Just imagine the feel and satisfaction I gain and feel!But it's time to go down so as we're going down, we enjoyed ourselves by watching the sun going down slowly!"
Second Visit to Ilchulbong Peak,"Cool Place, great mountain rock formation. Ilchulbong Peak is an hour travel via InterCity Bus #701 from Jeju City Hall cost around 2,050won. There are eateries and souvenir shops nearby. "
Majestic Seongsan!,"We arrived rather late to catch the sunrise and the place was already full of tourists but still managed to find a parking lot. The mountain was just amazing. The climb up was quite a climb but made easier with proper paths. So even with the crowds, there was plenty of room for everyone. The only disappointing thing was that when we got to the top, the crater just didn't look as impressive as in other photos. The views of the city are still fantastic so definitely still a must do!"
Great view!!,This really worth a visit. I'm not good at hiking but its quite easy to walk up to the top. For those who have been hiking in China this is really nothing. The wooden stairs also in good condition. Great view from up here :) Also you can have some local snacks here.
Pretty View during the climb,"I cannot remember the number of steps(some steep and chip steps) I climb up to the top. Very tiring climb and almost give up along the way. Among the climb, there are pretty views and I feel satisfied reaching the top."
Sunrise at Seongsan Ilchulbongd,"Very easy climb up (give yourself about 30min to 40min, if you are gioing for a leisurely stroll) from the visitor centre. If you plan to catch sunrise, do be prepared for strong winds. Going in december means sunrise is around 7.20-7.30am, thus we don't really have to wake up too early for it. "
Worth a visit,We wanted to catch the sunrise there but the sun was blocked by the clouds. It was a little disappointing as we climbed up when it was dark (cant see much scenery) and we had to descend without seeing the sunrise. It was nice to see the view from the top though!
Not for weak knees,"We were staying in Jungmun so it was a long drive to the peak. It was a rainy day so the steps were slippery. I made it up half way but turned back when the rain came. It was not a very difficult climb as there are steps and signs to guide you. I saw the older local people climbing up with no problem. There are many foreign and local tour groups there. On the left at the base of the mountain, you could see the female divers diving at specific time. There are many restaurants at the base for you to reward yourself after the climb."
Easy walk up to the top,"The view was amazing even if you did not make it up to the top. From halfway point onwards, you could see the awesome seaview. We went in the afternoon so that we could catch the divers' performance at 3pm. What impressed me the most about the performance was that the Ajumma actually went into the cold waters in winter! For that, it was worth my time standing out in the cold to show them our support."
Beautifull view,"Beautiful landscape where we can see ocean from the hill. Transport from Jeju city to here could use taxi, tour or bus. I use bus from Jeju Intercity terminal. Using bus no 701 and went back with bus no. 710-1. "
Good exercise with amazing view,"We took bus no 100 from seogwipo city to the last bus stop. Walk up the road to the next bus stop and got on the intercity bus no 701. Got off at the beach overlooking seongsan illchubong. Plenty of spots for great pics here. Walked all the way to the entrance and up. Manageable. Highly recommend wearing good comfortable shoes. The climb up was not as bad as I thought it would be. The view from the bottom was quite intimidating at first though. Many restaurants with reasonable prices to stop for lunch after the climb. Overall, good place to visit."
Great photo opportunity,"Nice place for small hike, photos and New Year s fireworksunesco world heritage sight One of the volcanic cones on the islandNearby you can watch the famous women divers"
It is worth it ,"It is worth the climb up. Although tiring, it is all worth it. I'm on top of the crater! Along the way, there are nice view. "
Beautiful splendid view,"No regrets coming here. The climb up via slopes and steps is quite manageable with some stops in between. Tho for inactive person like me, legs became a little wobbly as I came down ☺️ Windy & cold at times, so better have jackets ready. We took about 40 mins to ascend, stayed around for 30 mins. Descend was slightly faster "
Very impressive and well organised,The number one attraction on Jeju and an impressive climb to the top. Lots of signs to explain the geological formations at key points en route. The attractions divides the ascenders from the descenders which helps with the climb. Wonderful view from the top. The attraction is beautifully looked after no litter and only about £1 to visit. If you are lucky you will also be able to see the women who dive for fish which has become infamous with the Jamie Olivier programme in the UK.Worth a visit.
Slightly underwhelming,"Perhaps it was because my friend and I went on a gray and drizzling day, but we felt that Seongsan Ilchubong was slightly underwhelming. The climb was alright, slightly strenuous for the couch potato but not difficult. The crater and the view at the end of the climb were not as fantastic as we thought they would be. Though if you're driving, the coastal drive to this attraction was enjoyable. Do try the food and drinks at the foot of Seongsan Ilchubong too, like the fried potato on a stick and the tangerine drink."
Crown jewel of Jeju,"This was one of the few places in Jeju in which I wished I had more time to explore and actually take the trail up the the crater. Moreover, the place is a UNESCO World Heritage site.The attraction is located on the eastern edge of Jeju Island. I've heard the place is good for sunrises (why it's nicknamed Sunrise Peak). However, that may be difficult to do if your hotel is in the Jeju City or Seogwipo areas and so far away from the attraction. There is also a trail that heads up to the edge of the crater - which I unfortunately did not have the time to walk - but I would definitely advise anyone to take that trail if you have the time. There is also an opportunity to go horse riding, but it looked like it was more for kids rather than adults.I did have the time to walk on the lower parts of the attraction - near the bay/harbor/cliffs area. Notably, the area is extremely windy and cold, so be sure to bring the correct clothing especially during the off peak season. There are some spectacular views of the cliffs and of Udo Island if the sky is clear enough on that day. There are also some female divers that ""perform"" at 1:30 PM and 3 PM - although I did not get the chance to see them - if you take a trail to walk down to the bay/harbor area.This is definitely a must-see place to visit in Jeju and you'll get a lot of great photos here."
"Fantastic view, but crowded","This is a must-visit place in Jeju-do. Go on a clear, sunny day to enjoy a full panoramic view of east Jeju and the crater. Do try to catch the ""Hanyeo"" a.k.a. the female divers performance if you can! Be warned though, Seongsan Ilchulbong is a tourist hotspot and it will most certainly be crowded no matter what time you visit."
Nice view,"Lots of people, but it's expected. Climb was not too bad but my wife did need a rest in the middle. Provides great view on a clear day. Take some pics of it when you are far away if you are driving. There are places on the side of the road where you can park and take a few pictures of the entire thing. "
Impressive Crater..Tick Off Your List..But Crowded,"This is an icon of Jeju, so it is hard to imagine coming to the island without seeing it, and see it you should! But try to go in the early morning or late evening, if you want to avoid the tourist crowds. We went after lunch at about 1pm on an overcast day with showers and it was still pretty crowded..it does take something away from the beauty of the place. Tickets are sold, 2000 won per person, at the base of the crater. It is mainly stairs all the way up and takes 50 minutes return trip according to the sign at the ticket counter. We found this to be accurate. There are beautiful views down to the town and coast from the top. The crater itself, my partner and I, actually found more interesting from the bottom. There are many vendors and eateries around the base for snacking/meals before or after your climb. There are also restrooms at the base and 2 others we saw on the trail."
Amazing Seongsan,"convenient place for hiking and great view.. that i good place, street food nearby the parking place is nice... all snack nice yummy... and Seongsan will be good if see the sunset or sunrise, but while we arrive there to cloudy and windy."
Best viewed from the ground,"Perhaps there was some misunderstanding on my part, but it seems that it is no longer possible to watch the sunrise from the peak, as the ticket office information says that it only opens at 7.30am (sunrise is around 7am in November). The views during a day climb is still good, though mostly of Seongsan. As compared to the views from the peak, I found the beach at the foot of the peak (along the downward route) more interesting, with the lava formations and rock pools. Try and catch the haenyeo (female divers) in action if you can!Also, try to visit either very early or very late in the day - the crowds in between are huge (from the top, I counted at least a dozen tour buses in the parking lot)."
Amazing Sunrise,"This is probably the view that epitomises a Jeju trip - even the Jeju logo is a sun rising above the mountain.Hues of orange, pink and mauve intertwine in the distant horizon as the sea of gold gradually spreads, illuminating the lustrous greenery below.It's a 30 min climb before that, so make sure to wake early. The sunrise forecasts can be obtained on Google.This is worth booking a separate night's stay at Seongsan."
A relaxing hiking,"It is my first hiking ever, I do feel some kind of relaxation after the experience. At first, I wonder how can those people climb up to reach the top, it takes more than a thousand stairs to be on the top, I was pretty scared. But when I was first stepping on the environment, I can feel the natural beauty of the nature. It enhances me to have a greater heart to finish the journey. There also some strangely shaped stones while I was climbing up the stairs, I learned the history behind the stones and took several selfies with the special stones. About 20 minutes, we reached the highest point of the mountain. The mountain was naturally a dead volcano, which build up with lots of grasses and trees, and is no longer a crater. The view is like a green-sea. I had never been such relaxed before. It is a great experience to me and is memorable.The overall journey took us about 1 hour, if you are a fan of hiking, you must enjoy it as the view is priceless. **Remember to buy a bottle of water before you go, there are shops for you to buy some snacks and drinks in the beginning of the path."
Race to the top,"There are many people (locals and tourists) so if you wanna enjoy the untainted view, i suggest you go early, cause the view from the top is breathtaking. Do watch the hanyeo show, cause it's really interesting how these ladies are still so passionate about their craft. "
Climbing recommended,"This is sunrise peak at Jeju island you should to add in your travel list. Before go to Seongsan pls check the sunrise time. You will see a very fantastic view point here. Anaway, pls prepare your cloths for strong windy and cold. Along the walking platform the view is beautiful also. Do not miss it."
Great view,The hike to Sunrise Peak is great with great view along the hike. You also get to see the performance by woman diver and enjoy the fresh seafood caught by the woman diver.
impressive view,"we went to this place, but we didn't went up the park/hill/rock, as it will require lots of walking, which we didn't want to do :)you will still be able to have an impressive view at the entrance, and amazed by this natural creation. you can see the people walking up to the peak, enjoy the strong wind, as it is located by the sea, do a little shopping around the entrance area, or even find a nice cafe that is facing the spot to enjoy a hot coffee!"
It's worth the hike to the top,"Interesting volcano hike up to the crater ledge. Good views out over the coastline, even tho we had a rainy, cloudy day so didn't get the best of it! Quite steep steps and climbing at times. Exposed to wind too. We saw some of the Jeju women divers from the top just about to launch themselves into the sea. I am told it's VERY busy on new year's day when everyone goes up to welcome in the dawn."
World Heritage site worth the climb! aka Seongsan Sunrise Peak (城山日出峰),"This top site in Jeju island is also known as Seongsan Sunrise Peak or 城山日出峰 It earns its reputation as Korea's first UNESCO World Natural Heritage site, and once you reached the top, you will see why. Be warned, it is a reasonable difficult climb that will easily take 20min to hike up. Wear comfortable shoes and bring water during hot weather. The uphill stairway will take you to a majestic dormant crater that offers spectacular view of the sunrise, hence the name. Be prepared for massive crowd of tourists throughout your climb, and get your vantage point to capture some of the majestic scenery throughout your climb.On your way down after enjoying the panoramic view of the UNESCO World Natural Heritage surrounding, make sure you allow enough energy to take the downhill path on the left to explore the Haenyo women diver performance at certain times. We were there after 3pm, so missed out on them unfortunately."
Also known as Sunrise Peak,It needs some physical endurance to walk uphill to have a good view of sunrise or sunset. Many steps to climb so be prepare for it. It's absolute worth the climb as the scenic view is fantastic. 
spectacular view,It was windy when we were there but the view are spectacular. It's refreshing as Jeju doesn't have factories so the air was so fresh and cool. You can see Jeju from above. 
Jeju Gem - UNESCO Heritage site worth its salt,"Korea's first UNESCO World Natural Heritage site well-thronged by tourists. The uphill pathway leads to the majestic dormant crater and a path on the left of the ticket entrance brings you downwards to Haenyo women diver performance at 1.30 pm and 3 pm. Fresh catch of abalone, octopus, shells can be eaten sashimi style for about KRW50,000 per plate (pricey!). At this spot, you're closest to the ocean for a spectacular view of the stratified cliffside and lava rock formations. As you walk up the stairs, don't miss the platform for free binocular views of Udo Island. While the main goal of most tourists is to hike to the top of the crater, do look back at different vantage points for captivating views - azure sky, emerald sea, natural greens, black rocks and dotted by colourful buildings. Comfortable walking shoes recommended and beware of upskirting/fashion malfunction in the incredibly strong winds. Jeju Weekly reported that from the 2H of 2017, hikers to Sunrise Peak will be required to book in advance via a reservation system for the route to the top of Sunrise Peak. The move comes after the Jeju Provincial Government took advice from 25 experts about how to protect the value of the island’s natural sites."
The Ultimate Stairmaster,"Not a difficult climb, but if you haven't worked out in awhile, your legs will definitely feel like jelly on the way down. It took about 20 minutes to hike up the stairs to the top and another 20 minutes to get down. The volcanic cone and the view are totally worth visiting the top for. "
Great views at the peak,This is a world heritage site where a pathway leads to the peak of a long dead volcano. There are great views along the way. On the path leading downstairs to the ocean beach- they have the women divers show-at 1:30 and 3 pm as well as a seafood restaurant.
A must visit in Jeju!,"You must allocate few hours to enjoy the area. Hike up till the peak, watching the performance and enjoying the sea breeze."
Must visit place,"Wear your sport shoes, warm jacket, bring light snacks, a bottle of water, and of course..a determination. Dont forget camera as you will blown away by the scenery from the peak. Early morning is a good time to climb"
Beautiful place,"Big families aged 18-60. Didn't climb because the elders are not fit, came just for pictures. Still very beautiful. Need to allocate at least half day for climbing and resting. If you don't have time straight away go to Seojikopji, can view Seongsan from there, even more breathtaking."
Beautiful landscape,"First, we went to see the woman diver show. It appears to occur twice per day, at 1.30pm and 3pm if I remember correctly. They were singing, then entered into the water. I found their catch more interesting than their swimming. Afterwards, we climbed the ""mountain"" (small but cute is the motto). The view over the volcanic crater and the island is amazing, even despite the rainy weather that we experienced. The ascend is a bit physically challenging."
Splendid Sunrise,One of the must visit place in Jeju if you love watching sun rise. It takes about 30 minutes to climb up the steps to the viewing platform. We stayed at Sun Villa Pensions which was just above Nature Republic a stone throw away from the entrance of the park. You could see the crater from the balcony and Starbucks on the left. It was really convenient to have a place nearby as we had to wake up early to hike up and catch the sunrise (6.45am). The only down side is that the area as well as the park have limited street lights so you'll be needing a torchlight to walk either early in the morning or at night. 
Great view,"even if you don't have time to walk up to the top, it's worth going just to take photos and have a try at the freshly caught seafood."
Beautiful views,"No trip to Jeju Island would be complete without a trip to climb Seongsan Ilchubong (sunrise peak). A relatively easy climb that our 4 year old was able to do herself with only a little complaining, it's mainly just lots of stairs. Round trip takes about 50min they say. We didn't go at sunrise (we would have it we didn't have kids with us) which I imagine would be really pretty but still worth the climb up. There is a shop selling snacks and drinks half way up if you need to, as well as many at the base car park area. There is also horse-riding for 5000krw and you can go down to the water on the other side. Not easy to get to unless you have planned transportation or a car as not close to Jeju City, Segowipo or Jungmun. "
Beautiful,"Visited in Oct, very windy and cooling. Walked up to the hill top in 10mins. Very good experience and the tracks and steps were very nicely constructed. But the place is extremely crowded so photo taking was difficult. Worth the visit and the climb."
"Great anytime, day or nighy, wet or dry","I went early in the morning before the admission desk was opened and saw many walking up with torchlights. I went again in the afternoon and this time there was an admission charge and wad very crowded. There are restrooms at the foot of the rock and another on the way up. The toughest part would be the starting and it gets easier soon. It is a short walk up so pace yourself. The views and wind at the top was amazing. On the way down, look out for the diver women show which is at 1pm & 3.30pm. Look out for the rock resembling an eagle beak and the korean ironman "
Nice view but overcrowded,"We took bus 710 from intercity terminal, cost 3300won per way. A pretty long ride, about 1hr plus. Met two visitors, one from Singapore & another from Malaysia; very friendly and gave us lot of tips getting around. When we reached at noon, the place was packed with tour buses, people & soldiers (on sight-seeing). Not a difficult hike for reasonable fit person but certainly a challenge for older folk with the steep steps. Nice view but have seen better."
A very beautiful scenery from above,I always love nature. Visiting Seongsan Ilchulbong is a must when in Jeju. The hike is just nice. not that tiring. it's suitable for everyone. 
"Nice view, a must visit but...","Visited May 2016, season of summer but the day we visited it was a bit of rainy thus our tour guide told us to explore it before the rain totally pours as the place will be foggy means the view will be blocked. The view is nice, I traveled with my pregnant wife so we didn't went to the top as I assume you need to take that hundred or more steps to reach the top. Also, for the reason of not giving a perfect rating, the place is very crowded, though there is an entrance fee but no control of the number of tourist going inside. Its too many that we didn't enjoy much thinking that we visit it in off season, rainy weather, and even just wandering on the lower ground still crowded (refer to my picture that I took just in the entrance part only)."
A must-go,"It is not a difficult hike - it took us 30 mins and we stopped a few times for photo-taking. The view is spectacular. On your way down, make sure you go down the shoreline to visit the female divers (they have two shows at 1pm and 3pm). I wouldn't bother to pay for the abalone and octopus though, they are more expensive than dining in town. At the exit try the local Korean snacks, the swirl chips and orange juice are fantastic! "
Jeju Seongsan Ilchulbong,It is listed as a Unesco World Heritage and definetly a place to stop. Highway 1132 will bring you there and you cannot miss it. Be prepared that parking might not be easy and you may have to spend some time. The place is quite busy and many tourist buses are coming too. We had a cloudy day and it was very windy. Entrance fee is 2000 adult and 1000 child. Couple of shops at the entrance where you can buy each and everything. Please keep in mind that waste management is terrible as everywhere in Korea. If you buy something keep in mind that no any trash beans are available. The way up and down is quite crowded and loud. Obviously many tourists are rushing on top to get the selfies done to rush down again. The walk is definetly nothing for stroller or wheel chair. We went up slowly enjoying the view and getting some pictures. On top it is quite nice to look into the volvano and rest. Sure some pictures not to forget. But again very busy place and loud. Again our day was cloudy and windy but as long as it is not raining worth to visit the peak. So conclusion would be to visit the place very early. 
Breathtaking sunrise from Seongsan Ilchulbong,"Watching the sunrise at Seongsan Ilchulbong was definitely the highlight of my stay at Jeju. We had reserved a hotel right next to the attraction (Hotel Aroha), which was a very wise decision as all we had to do at 5 am in the morning was to get up, get ready and get going. There were hardly any people when we had started our ascent roughly 45 mins to an hour before sunrise. The hike itself is ~30 mins or less, but it can be a bit tiring because of the steep steps. We stopped a few times to catch our breaths and also interact with the locals. We had close to 10 mins before the sunrise by the time we were at the peak. The view from the sunrise is gorgeous, and even amidst so many people around you, it is still not chaotic but calm and serene. We stayed at the top for over 2 hours, taking pictures, resting, and even listening to some folk music being played by local artists. Great experience overall!The descent isn't tiring, so we took our time taking pictures and taking in the gorgeous views. At the base, we had freshly squeezed orange juice from Jeju oranges, which are again a must try!"
Beautiful Visit - must visit location on Jeju,"Going up on the peak is relatively easy with the path and steps that are well built. The view is awesome and we had a great weather day to enjoy it. It will take 20 minutes if you are fit, more like 30-45 minutes if you enjoy your climb gradually or need frequent stops for catching breath. If you time your climb so that you can view the performance from the Women divers (in the same complex) at 1:30pm or 3:00pm."
Breathtaking ,"This is a long way up but it only takes about 40 minutes. It's worth it, the view is amazing and I didn't want to leave. It's so relaxing, the only downside is, it's full of tourist so croissant are unavoidable, and it's always crowded"
A must see place if u go to Jeju,"A scenic spot to visit in Jeju. Recommended for travellers who like nature and sightseeing. However, It requires u to climb stairs in order to reach the peak. It might be tough for elderly. Scenery is definitely good with nice view and breezing air. "
Amazing view from the peak,You have to come as early as possible to watch the sunrise. And for sure you have to climb about 30minutes. The view fron thr peak during the sunrise is great.
A view worth your time,"This was one tiring experience, since it was freezing cold back in December.I am not sure if hiking in boots is a good idea, but hey who said that you can't hike in slippery boots? This was honestly worth a thousand words.Watching the sun set into the the buildings was such a beautiful experience. When i stood right on top with the cold breeze slapping my face, admiring the view and the nature, i felt like time has stopped and that feeling was quite amazing. That feeling was everything. I fell in love with that place."
Amazing sunrise,"Watching sunrise from the sea is amazing experience. You don't have to climb up too high, still can see the downtown below. And the way down is such a relax with beautiful view. Just 5 minutes walk from the bus stop and very near from Seopjikoji"
Amazing view. Must go!,This is definitely one of my favorite attractions that I had visit in jeju.Breath-taking view but of cos crowded with tourists.There are 2 route that u can choose to enjoy the views.There are pony ride & driving women show too. Do check up the timing of the shows.
save your money. view from the bottom is so much better,"unless you have never had a view of any city from about 250 meters high, take the hike up. otherwise the view is much much better from the bottomIt only costs about two bucks a person but there are throngs of people who visit this area. Part of the reason is because it is one of the stops on the tour buses and there were flocks of visitors that day. There is a wooden stairway all the way to the top and the view from atop is good. But it is not spectacular by any stretch. My suggestion is to pick a spot from one of the nearby restaurants for that photogenic moment. We went to the Sunrise restaurant (해뜨는 식당) and the view from there was just as good "
Lots of stairs!,"Went up on a cloudy day before the typhoon hit so the view was not too clear, but it was a quick climb up a ton of staircases. Took us 16 minutes to reach the top and we stopped a few times for photos. It was a pretty tiring hike up so young children or elderly people may find it difficult. The view was nice along the way and they have stairs so the path is very well maintained. It was crowded with a lot of tourists. "
Worth a look but not as impressive,"I have to say, when we reached the summit of Seongsan Ilchulbong we were a bit underwhelmed. It's impressive if you haven't yet seen the summit of Hallasan, but if you have it really doesn't compare. The crater of Seongsan Ilchulbong is porous, so it doesn't hold water like Hallasan. And it only takes you about 20-30 mins to reach the top viewing deck. It does make for a good photo, but so do the views of Seongsan village and the coastline nearby. The view on the pathway walking towards the base of it is also impressive in itself.It's definitely worth visiting, and there are plenty of little shops/stalls selling food as well as cheap souvenirs. Nearby is Ilchulbong beach, with black sand. Haenyeo female divers are famous here, and there is a restaurant at the far end of the beach serving fresh seafood caught by the divers, but we didn't have time to eat there."
easy steps worth the view,"A bit crowded but it's a 45min hike, the steps are well preserved and the view is really something, both the coastal view and the volcane crater are amazing."
Should offer great views,"Visited Seongsan Ilchulbong on a rainy and cloudy day. It was very busy, even with the bad weather.You can walk up via the stairs to the top of the volcano. With nice weather I am sure the views are great. When the top is in the clouds as today, I suggest you visit the house of the Jeju woman. Pretty sure you will be impressed by the skills of these older ladies. A must visit when in Jeju Island and having nice weather."
Breathtaking view of Seongsan Ilchulbong,"Its a very do-able climb up although at the first look it might look daunting. Even grannies reached the top! Once you slowly work your way up with plenty of pause in between, the reward at the end is amazing. Breathtaking views of the ocean and the crater.I'll do it again next time I go there! "
Amazing hike!,A must do when visiting Jeju Island! After the long trek to the top the scenery was worth every step it took to get there.
Beautiful area ,"The weather was not the best when we visited. Visibility was not very good. Nonetheless, this is a beautiful area and the views could be amazing on a sunny day. Recommended. "
Precisely Nature View,"Seongsan Ilchulbong is one of the places to be visited in Jeju island, it has three kinds of beautiful views: the sea, the mountains and the meadow.No need to climb or hike the mountains to enjoy the view, just stay at the flat ground and see the surroundings and feel the wind ... it also a pleasant experience."
Great view!,This is a must-do! You get to the peak using staircases which allows any age group to do this activity also. There are also toilets along the way. The view of the peak as well as Jeju Island is amazing.There are shops where you can buy souvenirs. You should try the tangerine ice cream 'cuz it's yummy! 
Short hike. Perfect view.,"Easy to travel to from either bus terminal (Jeju or Seogwipo). The hike is not daunting at all as it is primarily a flight of stairs and some inclined stones at the beginning. Entry fee is $2. No food is allowed inside so forget about having picnics. Provides a great view and the tuft is something special and best viewed in person , so do the short hike. Gets rather crowded but there are a number of places to eat at. I enjoyed it!"
Amazing views!,"This looks pretty daunting from the bottom but it is a fairly easy climb with lots of resting points, all of which have incredible views! Once at the top, there is a great seating area to take it all in. Beautiful place I would definitely go back and do it all again. Great value for money."
Good for a Climb,"If you are intending to go for the sunrise climb, please bring your own torchlight as lighting is minimal. About 2/3 of the climb comprise of a steep ascend. Not for the weak-hearted or those with circulation problems. It's physically challenging on the heart, not so much on the legs.Personally, a day climb (rather than a dawn climb) is better as you can see the view from the various heights. At the top, there are benches to sit and appreciate the view. Coming down was the easy bit as the stairs are well designed for the descend."
It looks nice,It looks nice when u stay far away to take photos! U need to buy tickets to get in and then keep walking! So I chose not to get in and just take a few photos outside 
What a workout!,"Visited on my self drive with my 60+ old parents, wife and 2 & 4 yo kids. Easy to find on GPS, plenty of parking. Those who don't fancy the hike up can choose to take a scenic path that's still pretty good (wheelchair accessible). We did the suicidal and hiked up baby carrying our kids. Wife and mum thighs are still aching after 3 days lol. It's quite a hike up multiple flight of stairs to get to the top but boy it was worth it! Great views of the crater and the city around, with a nice viewing area to park our tired bums. Mum almost gave up halfway though. Recommended for relatively fit people, think hard if you have old or young in your group."
Magic sunrise and vigorous walk,"Watch the Haenyo lady divers, walk the steep slope and look out as far as you can to the East...sunrise in the wee hours."
Horribly crowded,"I must have chosen a very good day to visit Seongsan Ilchubong. When I arrived, there were practically a few dozens sightseeing buses there, tourists as well as students for school outing. The whole place, paths walking up the hill and down to the seashore, on the hill top, everywhere! was FULL of people walking, talking, taking pictures…Go there as early as you can if you want to enjoy the view in a much relaxed way."
Sunrise and Camping,"The hike id quite steep, but only takes about 25 minutes if you take a few breaks. Entrance is ￦2,000. The path is all wooden and carved rock stairs. It's a great view! We came here right before Chuseok and stayed on the beach across from Seongsan. We wanted to watch the sunrise over the cone, but the sun was behind the cone from where we were. Make sure you hike the mountain or go to the park to watch the sunrise!"
steep hike but amazing views,"Although a very steep hike, this long flight of stairs does include many view points and amazing views at the summit. It was a little cloudy the day we climbed the summit and so did take away from the view a little but nevertheless was still great. I did the climb around March but it was still very windy, make sure if you go during this time you take something to cover you face/ears if possible as the strong winds make your face go numb with the cold. Would highly recommend to anyone who visits Jeju Island."
Easy walk,The weather wasn't the best. It rained on the way up and was very cloudy. Would have been great if the cloud had lifted. Still was an easy walk to the top and a must do. 
Nice hike,"Depending on the weather, it was scorching for me, this is an easy hike for all ages. It takes no longer than an hour to get to the top and back. The views of the crater and surrounding landscape is beautiful. A nice view of U-do island off the coast as well. Well worth a morning hike followed by a boat across to U-do island, where boats go very regularly."
Icon of Jeju,"Breathtaking view. Very breezy at the summit. It takes a bit of exercise, but not too difficult to climb. Well surrounded by cafe, restaurants and shops. Toilets are quite clean."
"Tough climb, but worth it!","This is a tough stair climb up to the top, especially on a hot and humid day in August. It is a gorgeous view all the way up and especially at the top. It is a new 7 Natural Wonders of the World, voted in 2011. I'd been wanting to visit since then and was not disappointed. You won't regret the view."
Short and sweet but a must see,"We took bus 701 from Jeju city... it only took 1hr 30mins when we were told it would take 2hrs which was a pleasant surprise. The walk up is (unsurprisingly) hard because of all the steep and often uneven steps. I would suggest going in the morning or late afternoon when it's not so hot because in the heat it was tough! People say it takes 20 mins which I would say is accurate but of course depends on your fitness levels. It was so worth it though, the views are incredible. They have an amphitheater like viewing platform I guess for those wanting to see sunset/sunrise. And you go down a different way so no clashing with people coming up. It can get quite busy though!"
Must see,I know it is soon tiring waking up at least an hour before the sun is even up and then be driven all the way there. It could take an hour for some as it did for me but MAAAN WAS IT WORTH IT! Loved it even though I had climed the Mt Hallasan yesterday and my legs and feet were killing me I was so happy to see the sun rising from this beautiful location. 
Short and sweet.,What a beautiful walk. The walk up is on one side of the hill and the walk down is on another so there are fantastic views to be enjoyed. It took me a half hour to go up the 180 meters and I am in good shape. Take water and sunscreen. 
Seongsan llchulbong Peak,"Located at the east coast of Jeju island, it is a crater of an inactive volcano lying out to the sea. A short walking trail to the top where you can get a beautiful view of the coastline. Next to the peak, you can watch the actual women divers show. Only two performance per day ( 1:30pm and 3:00pm ). Remember to bring sun glass, hat, sunscreen and water as the areas are wide open space with little cover. If you are thirsty, you can always try the famous local produce (fresh mandarin juice and mandarin ice block)."
Nice landscape but not for children ,"This natural attraction is very nice and worthy to spend a day, if you have young kids think it twice before you go, there is a long stairs up and if the weather is nice, you'll love it.Also visit the other attractions in the site "
Breath-taking views while you are catching your breath!,"Even though my family and I stayed in Breeze Bay Hotel which is within 3 minutes’ drive to the Seongsan Ilchulbong (Sunrise Peak) car park, we couldn’t wake up so early to hike up to the summit to catch the sunrise. Eventually, we were at the base of the Seongsan Ilchulbong at 10am, together with hordes of tourists and locals…and the sunny weather.Getting there and fees: GPS coordinate/code for this UNESCO World Heritage and South Korea National Monument site/attraction located in the east Jeju is 7830959. As the parking lots are limited, I suggest you drive (arrive) there early (before 9am). Parking is free. The entrance fees are 2,000 won for adults and 1,000 won for teenagers and children.The attraction: A non-stop no-rest ascent for a fit person takes about 30 minutes, but with my young children and with stairs-climbing not part of our daily routine, we took about 1 hour to make complete the 182 metres climb to the summit. There are several pointers that you may want to take note:(1) If you can, go on a weekday. We were there on a Wednesday mid-morning and already it was quite crowded, so I cannot imagine what the weekend would bring(2) Wear a pair of good-sole and comfortable walking shoes and bring enough water to hydrate yourself (you could still buy water at only one place during the ascent)(3) On a sunny day, you could bring an umbrella or wear sunglasses or a cap and preferably put on sunscreen lotion(4) Take note that the ascending trail or route is different from the descending trail or route, so do take lots of photos and selfies along the way. (5) Hike at your comfortable pace (although I understand that may not be possible when the tour guide requires you to be back at the bus within a certain timing) and do rest at the benches and the viewpoints or points of interest (e.g. huge rocks) whenever you are out of breath (give you an excuse to take photos and selfies)(6) There is no need to bring a jacket or sweater unless the weather becomes chilly or windy or cold (e.g. winter) or you are hiking in the wee hours of the morning to catch the sunrise. In fact, it was scorching hot when we reached the crater summit at around 11am(7) When you reach the summit, remember to pose with the signage says ‘Top of Seongsan Ilchulbong 180m’We started the climb after the 4 bronze round inscriptions (one of them is ‘New 7 Wonders of Nature’) on the uneven rocky or bumpy uphill sloped path. After a certain distance, this sloped ascending path became one that comprises of proper (stairway) steps. Look for the signage “Ascending Trail” and continue your ascent. Somehow the last stretch is a steep climb on continuous stairway steps and with so many people behind you, you simply cannot stop to rest. But once you reach the top, before you have time to catch your breath, your breath will be immediately taken away by the breath-taking panoramic views! You could see the flora-covered 600-meters diameter crater with 99 jagged rocky spires that resemble a crown, in addition to the Seongsan town (village), Seongsanpo-hang harbour, Cheju Haehyop (Cheju Strait), Mount Hallasan and others. It amazed me when I considered the almost symmetrical tuff cone crater was created by the explosion of an underwater volcano thousands of years ago. Due to the barriers, all visitors cannot walk into the tuff cone crater.Of course, the descent was relatively easier along wider wooden stairways with railings. When near the bottom, there are two directions to take. Going to the left, you could ride a Jeju pony (Jorangmal), which we didn’t go. Going to the right (signage “Women Diver Performance”), you would come to a black basalt rock cliff and also to a place to see the famous female divers (Haenyeo). To the right too, you would come to a lookout point for Udo Island (South Korea’s second largest island)Comparing with the only other tuff cone crater that I have climbed – Diamond Head in Honolulu – I find the Seongsan Ilchulbong more challenging to climb but it offers more breath-taking scenery. So don’t miss Seongsan Ilchulbong on your Jeju itinerary! Start the ascent early to avoid the crowd."
The view,The view after hiking to the top will amaze you. Just choose the perfect day to hike. Don't go in a hot sunny day or bring as much cold water as you can.
Awesome sunrise,Experience one of the best sunrise at Seongsan Ilchulbong. Suggest to stay close by do that you can walk up the hill. Take about 20-30 minutes depending on your fitness level.
Amazing sunrise,We spent the night at a Pension at the base so it was easy to get to to catch the sunrise. From the base we could already see people making their way up. We were prepared to spend at least 40 mins to climb the stairs but surprisingly we got there within 20 mins. I would not say it was a breeze as we (and most people there) were panting and had a good sweat. Regardless of your fitness level just go at your pace with comfortable shoes and attire - the beautiful sunrise against the ocean is definitely worth it (unless it's bad weather)
Whew!,"This was a beautiful climb, but let me tell you, it's a climb. Granted we seemed to go on a particularly hot day at like 1:00 pm so that didn't help.I recommend taking water with you, but if you don't feel like carrying it, there is a store about half way up that you can get water and snacks. There are also lots of souvenir stores and restaurants at the base to stock up on supplies before heading up. I also recommend sunscreen and bug spray.There was a short line to pay about $2.00 for an entry fee. You received a ticket stub with a pretty picture of the volcanic crater on it. The trail is one-way: meaning there is one trail that goes up to the peak and one that returns down. This cuts down on congestion and ensures a scenic route the entire way. There are lots of places to take pictures and rest along the way. The time it takes to complete the trail all depends on your fitness level, but it is advertised as a 50-minute round-trip experience. At the peak, there are numerous places to sit and relax. You can see a beautiful 360-degree view of Jeju and Udo. Other items of interest: Horseback riding is available here and you can see the famous female divers of Jeju."
What a view!,"It was my first time climbing. Being the unfit person I was, I was panting a little when we crossed the halfway mark. It was cold and windy in March, so I was all wrapped up, but with every break I took, I was busy taking my layers off! It's not that hard to climb up, just that I was not prepared for it. It's important to stay hydrated. It's worth the effort - the view is really stunning, even through the ascend. Enjoy!"
Great spot for catching sunrise,"It will take about 30 to 40 minutes to hike up the mountain which involves lots of stairs. View is superb, especially during sunrise because you will be facing east. There are quite a number of shops and restaurants down there, perfect for breakfast after morning hike. Spacious carparks. p/s: I read somewhere that there will be entrance fees (KRW2000-3000). However when we went there, the ticket booth was closed, perhaps because we went there at dawn."
Good climb. Great view,"We were lucky because when we went, there weren't a lot of tourist going up. Otherwise, it will be even more tiring as everyone will have to accommodate each other's pace. A lot of stairs to deal with but when you're at the top, it is worth the effort. We took about 20 mins (I think), stopping occasionally to take pictures of the scenic view down below. If you're tired, don't worry as there are enough benches on the way up to rest to regain your energy, if it comes to that. It is manageable overall.On our way down, we went to the black sand beach. Spent about 40 mins there, soaking in the view from another angle. If you want the full experience, you can take the boat out with the lady divers (Hanyeo) and see them in action. Alternatively, very fresh seafood is available for your palate should you want to try. From the sea, to the chopping board and straight to your plate (raw) and that's how they eat it. We didn't do that. Can't find the courage to do so. Lol. If the heat really got to you, after the climb down, go to one of the coffee places (Angel-in-us or Starbucks) to cool down before you go elsewhere. Be prepared to sweat buckets!!!"
"Great views, Good short hike for the whole family","Like other hikes in Korea there are a lot of stairs. But that also means that there are plenty of places to rest which is great when you're hiking with small children. My 8 year old and 4 year old made it up and back without difficulty. They were hot but we were lucky to have had a breeze the entire time. The views were great from the top and along the way. There are two covered rest areas on the way up and plenty of benches if you get tired. The cost is the same as many other nature sites on Jeju, ₩2000 per adult and ₩1000 per child. There are horse rides for ₩5000 at the trailhead. There is an adjacent beach and divers show but we decided not to go to and opted for food instead. Just outside the entrance there are a number of shops for ice cream, food, and fresh squeezed mandarin juice. The hike took about 60 minutes total going at a slow pace. Without kids one could do it quite a bit faster. Overall it was a great way to spend about half a day."
A 20 minutes climb up,"A climb with lots of stairs and lots of tourists. The place is crowded and with little shade. I recommend to come for either the sunset or if you are like me and cannot wake up in time, do this walk in the evening time, so it's not too sunny. The view is very nice and offer a wide vista of the greenery. After the walk, you can enjoy exploring the adjacent black sand beach."
Marvelous view,"It takes around 30-45 mins to climb up. But after this amount of time, it is worthy to climb because of the marvelous viewOne of the things I hate the most here is that there are so many Chinese. It seems to me that I was in China, not Korea.The toilet at the foot of the mountain was so smelly.You can ask for discounted price if you are below 24."
Sunrise!,"I am not an early morning riser. However, since this place is one of the most recommended place to visit in Jeju, my friends and I decided to wake up super early to watch the sunrise. The stairs to get to the peak were steep, I had to stop to catch my breath a few times before reaching the peak. It was worth it though, the sunrise view was so pretty, and actually one of my best experiences in Jeju."
Its 180m height,"it's really a place that should visit in jeju.even we have to climb for 180M but when u arrived at the peak.the view is amaging, really worth to go there!!!"
Worth the climb - suddenly arrived at the top,"The sun was shining though not really hot this time (last time 9 years ago was rainy). I wasn't sure how far up I wanted to climb but started off with the family anyway. Personally I preferred slopes to stairs. I saw these signs which showed the distance to the peak (caldera): 274m, 180m, etc. I almost decided to turn back because I thought I would be late if I continued to the top when suddenly I reached the top. Turned out that those were distance markers and not altitude markers. The view at the top was really good. The grass in the crater was lush green. No steam here. The walk back down was very manageable, and had some good photo spots. Towards the bottom, the vast patches of perfect green grass were really pretty."
Spectacular views all around,"Depending on your fitness level, conquering the mountain will take you anywhere between 20 to 50 minutes, the latter with room for many rest breaks. The climb is shorter than you think, however, and very very soon after the second pavilion you reach you will find yourself at the top and before a gorgeous volcanic crater. The views are 360 degrees spectacular and the mountain is a must visit if you come to Jeju, even if you're not there for sunrise or sundown."
Divide (beach and crater) and conquer!,"The sporty men in our family bet us they could climb up and get back to the beach in 30 minutes before the grandkids complained! They made it! The view of the mountain from the beach below is spectacular, and the beach has plenty of hermit crabs to keep kids occupied for hours. The men loved their quick scramble to the peak, and their photos of the crater are gorgeous. Note: these 30 and 54 year old men are extremely fit, and reported that others were struggling with the steep ascent."
Very pretty place,One of the scenic places in Jeju. A must go even if you miss the sunset/sunrise. Didn't climb it but I went down to the the Hanyeo area. Tiring climb back up though. You can see Udo Island from here.
Nice view and scenery but quite a hike for those unprepared,"Was lucky to have been here as it was free for the entrance. Usually per entry would cost 2000 won but it was a holiday. The scenery and view is amazing up top. The view of the crater is nice but the view 180 degrees around is way better. You will see the town which you stopped at and the immense coastline around. Would highly recommend if you can catch the sunrise however it is quite a journey away from the Jeju city which means you have to time your travel right. Visiting during normal hours will still give you the breath taking view. Just a catch, you would have to hike. If you are fit enough, it should take you 15 to 20 mins up top. Can be pretty steep so take your time and rest along the way."
"Great views, easy to find, easy to reach the top","I was on my way to another destination when I saw this place. I caught the 700 bus that runs around the outside of Jeju island for a cost of around $2, and wondered why so many people were getting on and off at this stop, so on my way back I got off. It ended up being my highlight of the day.It was a lovely sunny day with a few hundred people climbing up, and with ramps and steps all the way it was easy. I got to the top in about half an hour if not less. The views from the top were probably the best I experienced for my whole trip in Jeju, and that includes the view I saw from top of Mt Hallasan.At only 2000 won entry, it's a must-do when visitng Jeju, and there's lots of restaurants at the bottom."
"Spectacular View after a Short, Steep Climb up Stairway","After a short, 30-minute climb up a fairly steep, crowded stairway, we were treated to a spectacular view, and to a separate down stairway. Well worth the climb!"
Breathtaking view,"Its a photogenic nature scenic to visit and go. Take pictures as many as u can. And hiking up to the peak made u tired, but u will get the breathtaking view there. "
beautiful view,beautiful hill with great fresh air. Just enjoy the nature when there is less tourists.the tourist diver really sucks and waste of time.remove some of the rural tourists and this will be even better.
Worth the Visit even on a Partly Cloudy Morning,"We hiked up Seongsan Ilchulbong to watch the sunrise. It's a 20-40 minute walk to the summit where there is a spectacular view of the dormant volcano, a beautiful view of the sunrise even on a cloudy day and numerous other spectacular views. There is a large platform at the summit so even though there were at 100 others, there was plenty of room. On your way down, you can visit the adjacent lagoon where there are pearl diving demonstrations and enjoy some additional views. There is also a very nice Buddhist Temple near the parking lot at the base of Seongsan Ilchulbong.The walkway has steps going up and there is a separate route going down.Tips: (1) Wear good walking shoes. Some of the walkway is jagged volcanic rock, and the steps could get slippery if wet. (2) Bring a camera.--"
Spectacular View at Sunrise,"My son live and work teaching English in Jeju , I spent 10 days with him in his apartment and this trip to Seogwipo and the hike will always be in my heart. We stayed in nearby hotel and woke up 4am started walking and climbing the steps to see the sunrise on the top and its all worth it .. Indeed Jeju has teh rightful name - the island of the Gods."
Summer holidayyyyy ,"The place is so great. The geopark is one of UNESCO heritage world. We must climb at about 500 stairs to reach the peak. In a good weather, you can go there early in the morning to see the sunrise. The combination of mountain and beach (with the black sand) is so beautiful. You can also see the performance of woman diver there and buy live seafood."
The beautiful crater in the sea,"It was amazing!This is the worth place to go. The entrance fee is very cheap just 2000 won and the transportation arround 3300 won.Then Seongsan Ilchulbong Peak will gives unique view that you will never see in another place. It is very easy to go here, just take a bus from Jeju intercity Terminal or Seogwipo Intercity terminal then stop on Seongsan Ilchulbong Entrance, Just walk for 10 minute from the bus stop to the ticket booth. "
Worth the hike,This place is quite far from the main city so we hired a driver to take us there because you need to start early to be able to make it in time for sunrise. When we got there it was still really dark since it was barely 5. We started hiking up and there were few people along the way but once you got up to the top there's already a bunch of people sitting around waiting for the sunrise. 
Unforgettable Sunrise,"Arriving parking lot around 4ish in the morning. It's dark but u can see other people going to same direction, just follow them. I guess we took around half an hour or less to reach the top. I didn't stop for a while because i'm so afraid I will miss the sunrise. Turns out some people arrived the top earlier than us! That day was a bit cloudy but still we can see the beautiful sunrise. It's really amazing experience! Besides I am quite impressive with their trail, well furnish with stones and woods. Quite interesting when u look down to the town, must go for Jeju trip."
"Nice place, unfortunately too crowded","Really like the walk to the top, nice view, unfortunately it was a bit too crowded for me. Go early on the morning if you want to avoid the crowd"
Amazing View,"It's a really really nice place except for the diver women with the fishes and dead octopus, that's gross and I'm vegan. Anyway, you can pay for a quick boat trip to see the surroundings of this place like caves and also a rock full of birds (Think of Paracas, Peru, i think it's similar). The view at the top is AMAZING, like I said, you can see all Jeju? Seogwipo? I don't know but it's BEAUTIFUL. There are also many food spots and stores plus Starbucks and Dunkin Donuts."
Misty morning climb,"Sunrise peak another UNESCO,drizzling while we climb the peak. Crowded even the weather wasn't good. Descending is nice. "
Nice view!,"Walking up the stairs is tiring but once at the top, you can see the craters which are filled with greenness of plants... View the surroundings from top is superb! Good for nature lovers yet those that do not want to hike the hill...At the seaside below the hill, you can enjoy seafood fresh fr the sea!"
So pretty. Great for non climbers.,It is really great how many things you can see on Jeju for less than $3 a person. We did not climb to the top but went into the park to the left to see the cliffs and get a closer look. You only have to walk a little to see a lot. Ample parking and coffee shops nearby. It was so beautiful despite the crowd. It was rainy and windy. Raincoats are sold in the gift shop. 
Crowded but fun!,"Don't come here expecting a serene nature hike - the crowding on the stairs leading up is chaotic. However, I believe that's half the fun, dodging selfie-sticks and all, so join in and enjoy it! Oh, and get an ice cream in a ridiculously massive J-shaped cone when you're finished :)"
Witness the sunrise ....,Suggest to Come earlier at around 4.30am to witness the sunrise and you will never regret. You may want to take a panorama photo or 360 degree if you have such a device. Highly recommended.
Simply beautiful,"We, a group of friends had visited this place last week. It was awesome! The journey to get there, parking and the walk up and back were all good. There is ample parking space and plenty of eateries that offers various types of snacks and cold drinks.The area is impeccably clean and the walking path was clear and safe. The steps may seem a little steep at certain points, but you will be well rewarded once you reach the top. The crater is a beautiful sight! Not surprising that it's the iconic image of Jeju which appears on Google. You need about an hour or so for the entire visit. "
Nice for a short visit ,"We went up in 20 minutes and down in 15, we are quite fit, all age groups going up and even people in flip flops!) I would recommend you time your visit so that you get to see the women divers (13:30 and 15:00) either before or after your walk. If I went there for just the walk I would have been disappointed, the photos you see are of course ariel views and a walk up doesn't give you that view, having said that the coastal views from above are nice. It was raining when we went but it was still do-able. We took bus 701 (runs every 20 mins 3300 wan per person each way) from seogwipo and back. It stops at Seongsan-ri office, ticket booth is a couple of minutes walk away. "
Worth the walk ,"The walk up the mountain provided beautiful views! The mild spring weather and breeze allowed for an easier ascend for a ""not so in shape"" person. Did not go for sunrise but pretty regardless. Easy to locate parking lot and shops near by to accept your money;). "
Amazing scenery,"It was my second visit, it's as windy here in winter as in autumn. Spend at least 2 hours here. Take the stairs down to the coast, there's a small house/shop there that sells fresh seafood like small octopuses and abalones."
Best place in Jeju,"Must see place in east part of island.Wonderful atmosphere is there. The trail takes about 1 hour.It's possible to reach from west Seogwipo by bus.Choose airport limousine 600,get off in stop ""World cup stadium"".Then find intercity bus terminal-about 50m to the right-there is tourist info also. Then get in a bus 701-journey lasts about 1.5 hour-get off in""Seongsan Ilchulbong park entrance""-and here you are.I added sunrise schedule."
A must place to go in Jeju.,"When you said about Jeju, this Ilchubung will appear in the advertisement and you will know that is Jeju. But for sure, you will not able to snap a photo like in the adver since that only can be done if you take a photo from the helicopter and etc.For family, it is a bit tough if you bring small kids below 10 yrs old since you need to walk to the peak via stair and for adults people also a tiring activity but worth it since you can see the good view of the city and sea around that area. For photography also it will a nice thing to have.They said, the best thing during sunrise to be at the peak, but we are not make it during the sunrise so could not provide any comments on that. Also there is free show of diverwoman at the beach area just that area, they showing the activity of catching octopus with diving and selling the octopus to the audience. Most of the korea people eat it raw with Korean Sauce, i'm yet try the tast.Souvenir shop also available at the entrance of the Ilchubung peak.Thank You."
Breath Taking Scenery,We managed to hike up to the top in 20 mins and complete the round trip within one hour leisurely. It is a simple and easy track with flights of stairs. The view is wonderful when you view from the top down the slope. Remember to get prepared with sun block apparel if it is a sunny day. 
Nice views but extremely crowded,"Hiked up this mountain with a friend. Quite an easy hike and the views of the surrounding area are pretty nice. Crowds of tour groups around this site and bad quality food stalls at the base make this an unpleasant place to hang around. Get in, get up the top and get out."
Breathtaking view,Made it to the top with the strong wind. Amazing view from the top after endless steps that brought us up to 180m above sea level! Definitely gonna repeat the trip!
A thing of beauty,"This Volcanic creation is a thing of beauty! To get there from our hotel it took us approx 45 mins (we stayed at Lotte Hotel in Seo Gwi-po cityplz check out my other comment about this hotel). This island sticks out from the main island so you would have to take a boat ride to get there. Once you're there, I was told you can hike up to the top (see the crater), unfortunately, we got there pretty late so we missed the last boat. People here are super nice but I suggest you either go on a guided tour or bring your English-Korean translator gadget because not many people here speak English!!"
"a must see in jeju ,Korea","all the ways up the top is basically stairs ,the design has quite a lot of resting places along the way ,if you are fast,half an hr can reach the top"
The view of the sunrise is a perfect reason to get up early,"Yes, the walk is steep and if you go for sunrise, you will be starting off in the dark, but it doesn't take long to reach the top (16-30 minutes for reasonably fit people). The most important thing is to watch the forecast beforehand to ensure a lovely sunrise. The views are outstanding. It can get quite crowded at the viewing ""steps"" at the top, so get there early to stake out your perfect viewing spot. The walk down will obviously be in much lighter conditions, affording some incredible views of the coastline and the little town of Seongsan. Early morning or during the day, any time would be a fantastic time take this short - but oh so worth it - hike. There is plenty of accommodation for all budgets in Seongsan at the foot of the mountain and bus 701 or 710 can take you directly there from Jeju City Bus Terminal. In April, 2016, the entrance fee cost 2000 Won for adults."
For Nature Lovers,A place you surely need to visit when in Jeju. It reflects how amazing nature is. There are restaurants nearby that offers very tasty seafood meals. Abalone shells are the best.
The view will amaze you,"Although we have to climb all the way up but looking at the view from the top, really worth it. Cold breeze make our step a bit slow. Unfortunately we don't get a chance to take a sunrise view from the top. "
Climb of a Lifetime,"If you're in good health and can take a steep climb, I would suggest not to miss out on catching the sunrise at Seongsan Ilchulbong. There are other activities available in the area such as horse riding on Jeju's famous horses and plenty of restaurants and coffee shops nearby. "
Beautiful peak,Fantastic scenery with enchanting view. A very attractive place to take families as the foot of the hill so convenient. However do provide more facilities for picnic purpose..
"Beautiful walk along the paths, great sea views","A great way to enjoy the view and burn off a few calories at the same time. It's a lovely coastline with a spectacular panorama of the area, definitely a nice little hike. You can easily spend a couple of hours here. Very enjoyable."
Nice view for nature lovers!,you need to prepare extra energy to climb up the hill. Recommended to go there before dawn to see sunrise. Nice view form the top of the hill. 
"Stunning place, stunning views. Has become really touristy","This is one of my favourite places to visit in Jeju. No matter which angle you are taking photos from, the views are gorgeous. You can hike up Seongsan as well, if you are up for it. Or you could go down nearer the shoreline to catch a glimpse of the women divers. Past that area, and you can make out Udo Island in the distance. It has gotten extremely crowded over the years though, with tons of tour groups making their way here. It still remains a must-see area in Jeju, in my opinion."
Caldera high up - great view far into the island and the sea,A good long hike up but really worth it. The vista is stunning.We had bought 6 very nice Hillabong oranges just next to the restroom in a little shed (really worth it) and found out that we needed to leave the rest of them and all our other food at the counter where they check the tickets. What we didn't know is that the counter closes at exactly 6pm. When we heard the announcement we were only half way down... one person in our group decided to run the rest of the way and then managed to negotiate (in Korean) with the guardian to get the oranges and food back...
"saw the sunrise, magnificent view","great experience, tiring when climbing up, but glad to see the sunrise and feeling the cool sea breeze. magnificent view, must visit"
worth the sweat!,"Bring along a lot of water before climbing. There is few cafe that open very early at the counter ticket area, for you to have anything if you feel hungry before climbing, but just for snacking. The entrance fee is 2k Won, if im not mistake. The view was great along the way from bottom to top. After half-way through, there is a checkpoint with nice scenery of the city and ocean during dawn, which is so beautiful. Better to take picture during that time of your climbing if you climb to see the sunrise, because when you get down, it is another daylight scenery. If you are not fit enough or dont have that much stamina, don't worry, it is still okay for you to climb, you just need a strong will to arrive at the peak and keep on going. As the view from top is worth the sweat!For you to see sunrise, its better for you to be down at the entrance as early as you can, during my time, I already there by 530am, the gate open at 6am as far as I can remember. If you climb slow and steady, it will take you about an hour to climb to the peak. Just keep in mind, if there is a lot of clouds, you might not be able to see the sunrise. So check your weather before you go."
Great exercise!,The view was great from the bottom and top. It's a good upwards hike that makes your heart pumping. The stairs coming down made me had a vertigo. It was worthwhile though.
Superb views, A must visit when you come to Jeju. Great ocean views. Its quite a drive from the city around 2 hours but its worth the experience and super views . Entrance fee : 2000 KW
Great Climb with Kids,"Young kids will struggle up the 1,000 steps but the 5 year old with us made it! A lot of people/tour busses but the crowds diminish somewhat as you climb. Many places to rest along the way up. Great view at the top. "
Beautiful scenery but be prepared to climb alot,"Need more than 2 hrs here to enjoy the scenery and also street food at the entrance. Be prepared to climb alot and travel light so you can enjoy the views. If you are driving, may need to park some place far off as the carpark can be crowded. Advisable to have a meal before hiking up and down. "
One of the 7 New Wonders of the World,"A must do in Jeju. We hired a taxi driver to take us and it was 2000won a person to enter. We wanted to go for sunrise but there was an extra fee to hire them that early. (If you want to rent a car, make sure you have an international license - it's about 1.5hr from Jeju city) The hike really isn't too bad. It is an incline, and yes there are lots of stairs, but it is do-able. There were plenty of elderly hiking up and lots of places to stop. Beautiful view from up top. Entrance also allows you to go down to the beach and see the women divers and eat fresh catch."
Great sight all around,"Seongsan Ilchulbong is the best location on the Eastern part of Jeju Island. It is definitely an awesome place. It might however best be enjoyed not from the top of the volcano itself, but by walking or driving around (or flying?). The reason is that when you get to the top of the volcano, the caldera isn't as impressive as the one on top of Hallasan mountain. I did visit it during the day, and I get that it's more stunning at sunrise. It's still very nice. What's also great to see, if you climb the volcano, is to look back, and look at Udo island or the heart of Jeju island, with the villages and Hallasan in the background. Definitely a must-do in Jeju."
Beautiful views from the top of a small volcanic crater,"The climb is not too bad with stairs going all the way up. The view from the top is amazing and definitely worth the climb. Below there is also a show put on by the women free divers, as well as a short boat tour to see the other side."
Most fascinating scenic views in Jeju,It takes a little effort climbing up the peak but the fascinating view to Jeju from the top worth the climb. Do enjoy the view along the way & suggest to make an early morning trip to enjoy the stunning sunrise view from the top . There is haenyeo show beside the walking path which worth to explore how this great diving skill passing down the generation to women only divers can dive into the sea to pick up abalone & others sea produce without an oxygen tank
Seongsan Ilchulbong Sunrise Peak - Superb!,Seongsan Ilchulbong Peak is a UNESCO World Heritage site. I love it going there. Very peaceful and very greenish place at the bank of the see. I will strongly recommend you to go there. Really an awesome place to visit. Do NOT miss it.
Breath-taking despite the gloomy weather,"It was unfortunate that we were met with poor weather but despite so, the view was still worth the visit. A must-visit not only for the scenery and fresh air, but also for Korean drama fans!"
Be-you-ti-ful!,"Seongsan Ilchulbong - one of the main attraction in Jeju. Suitable for those who love sightseeing. Definitely worth a visit because of the view was extremely stunning. I went here in Feb, weekday..but surprisingly this place still packed with people, mostly local..but who cares..the more the merrier rite? :P"
The view ,"The view is nice. If you just want to see the view, half up just ok. If you want to see the crater then go up and see. Nice view"
"Not just the sunrise, the sunset is amazing from here","We could not come here to enjoy the famous sunrise, but we had the chance to see the sunset from the top. AMAZING! If you come with bus #701, you should get off at the bus stop called ""Entrance to the Seongsan Ilchulbong Peak"". from there, the entrance is only two blocks away. Climbing up to the top is takes around 20 mins. NOTE --> If you would not take your luggage or bag with you to the top, but leave the in the number coded lockers downstairs, don't forget to check the opening hours of the luggage store!!! When we were there it closed at 6 pm, we got there only 4 mins past 6, and despite the place was still open, the lockers could not be opened anymore even with the right codes after 6 pm. We had to call the emergency number shown on the locker side, to unlock it for us and retrieve our bags."
Great view on the top,"After a long way climbing up to the death volcanic, you can enjoyed the paranomic view at the peak of the seongsan. It's worth ."
Panoramic view of the sea and islands,"It was a short range climb, about 20mins (if you walk fast), about 40mins (if you take frequent rest along the way).. It is quite steep and tiring.The view from the top is really superb! The sea is really wonderful."
Stunning place to see sunrise and sunset. ,"This place was one of the highlights in my jeju trip and it did not disappoint me. Seongsan area are small and stroll-able with mostly seafood restaurants. I stayed in a guesthouse that's literally right at the entrance of the peak. So took me fifteen minutes from getting up to reaching the peak. The stairs was not for the fainted heart and Or who has knee problems. If you think the stairs may concern you, come little early and really take your time there are a few platforms you can stip while climbing up. "
Enjoying The Scenery from The Top,"To Enjoy the scenery, atmosphere we should climb up within the path. To climb up it takes about 30-45 minutes if we walk slowly. You can enjoy the Clean Air here. The View will be very nice."
"Great tourist place. However, it is quite crowded.","If you want to hike up to the top, please be prepared to take a couple of hours as it is extremely crowded."
Crowded but climb was pleasant due to well paved paths,"We started our climb at 9am by which time the tour buses had arrived. Eventhough it was crowded it was a safe climbing environment because the paths were well paved with grab railings. The elderly and young could stop at rest points along the way. The view of the crater at the summit, the scenic coastline up and down the paths is worth the climb. Give yourself at least an hour to enjoy this amazing Unesco site. "
Stunning view! Great history behind the site!,My friend and I enjoyed the hike up the stairs to the top and the view of Jejudo was worth the hike up. Took roughly 10-15 minutes to get up. There are rest stops on the way to the top. There are shops on the bottom if you need some energy before or after the walk :)
Great View!,"We took bus 701 to the foot of the hill. We thought we had got off at the wrong stop as it was very quiet at the bus stop. We walked a little uphill and saw that we were on the right track. Admission was W2,000. The stairs made it a very easy climb. One direction up and one direction down. Very scenic along the way and at the peak. Very windy though."
crystal clear,"sea is too clean and air too..if you go there, there is no polluted area atmosphere fits in any situation suitable for all ages..."
The place YOU HAVE TO VISIT,"it was my second time visiting there.The stairs are very steep and narrow, so I don't recommend wearing any shoes that's slippery. Do bring a camera!! the view is amazing just everywhere!and it's a bit windy once you reach the top"
A must place to visit ,"This place is the signature sightseeing here. So every tourists would be here. It's crowd with people. There're many shops, kiosk, snack bar and food shops at the front of the sightseeing. So there are large space for parking. You need to buy ticket to get in there. Once you get ticket, you walk straight on the walk way till you see the junction. There's the highlight signage for photo shooting. And you need to choose either way to go. If you go to the right, you need to walk up to the hill and you will see the good view from there. The way to go up the mountain is fine, not too rough. But not recommend during rainy day.If you go to the left, you will see fisherman Village, sea sand sun and fresh seafood from local people. The highlight is the lady from the village dive deep into sea to get the seafood stuffs."
Nice view even in rains,"We have visited this place, Sunrise mountain during Rains. It was raining heavily. While entering we bought raincoats and started tracking. View was so amazing at that time, you just want to keep looking for hours. Rains + Fog has made this place much beautiful. We have got many amazing pics of this place and will remember the same."
Amazing view,One of the most amazing and picturesque natural beauty in Jeju Island. Definitely worth a visit when you go to Jeju island. 
Breathtaking view,"We really loved it here, we went there on winter time so sadly we couldn't see the sunrise. But we could see the beautiful view of the mountain with some covered by snow. So beautiful! Tip : Use good shoes that are not slippery especially on winter as there were much slippery frozen water."
Nice view,Nice view here but too windy and cold for us who comes from tropical country..but we enjoy out trip here.. We eat at the korean restaurant who serve abalone poridge just the front of entrance..
Breathtaking views,A nice walk to the top with spectacular views. Not too strenuous and well worth it. One of my favourite attractions in Jeju!
Mountain Lovers!,"It's a mountain. A very beautiful mountain. If you visit here, then you MUST climb to the top of this mountain. Tired? Don't be. Because there are STAIRS to the top. All you have to prepare, is a will, drink, hat then just walk to the top. The view is sooooo Amazing!! You'll paid off all of your sweat up there. "
Good for exercise,MUST go!!! Must climb!!! The view is nice. Nice view for photo taking. Do stay up there longer to enjoy the nice view.
Breathtaking view,This is a must visit here in jeju island. The climb is much easier than it looks.Take some beautiful pictures along the way and more at the summit.Enjoy the view and breeze at the top.
Must Do in Jeju,For me this is a must do as it is to me the main attraction for visiting Jeju island.Seongsan Iichulbong is one of the many UNESCO Heritage sites around the world.The name Seongsan Iichulbong also means Sunrise Peak. The view at the top is very scenic and breath taking. It takes about and hour to walk up and back to base. There were many local and foreign tourists climbing up to the top. Many people scrambling around to take photos.
A great place for sunrise,"You just to to climb up the staircase for around 30 minutes and you can enjoy the nice scenery. The first bus from jeju bus terminal is 5:40 a.m, and u will reach there by 6.40a.m. so you can still catch the sunrise during winter."
Cool refreshing place to be!,It's a rather refreshing place!! The rocky trail is a little difficult for my parents who are over 60. Will come back to climb it again!
"Great for a morning workout, if u are lucky, u can catch the sunrise!","Climb was ok, first smooth hill roads, then mainly steps to the top. View wemhile climbing was nice. We did not manage to catch the sunrise due to cloudy skies. However, the view of jeju from pre dawn to dawn while climbing up was worth it. U literally see the city lights up before ur eyes. "
Not during winter or cloudy,"This is a place to view sun rise (according to review), distance about 50km from Jeju-si.If the weather is raining, or cloudy, forget it, this is for the good weather visits."
Scenic Place,Good place to visit. We joined YEHA's East Course tour and this is one of the stops. A 20-25 mins walk up the slope to the tip of the peak. Nice to do this at end Nov where weather is cool. You can get a good view when you reach the top. You can visit Woman Drivers taking their dip at the base. There are many shops at the base where all buses and cars park.
Must Visit. A very scenic places! ,Seongsan Ilchulbong also called as Sunrise Peak! It's located on the Eastern end of Jeju do Island. There is a huge crater at the top of the peak! The place is really wonderful with magnificent view. Strong wind. Cooling. The way up are well prepared and safety. Suitable for children so no worried.  
20 minutes workout to the top!,"Yes I did it! Even though I almost fainted half way, wore skirt and wrong shoes, everything was worth it when you were at the top! It felt like I was climbing stairs of 50 floors building and every steps on the way full with regrets like 'why, why i'm here climbing this!' However, all that thoughts were gone when I was on the top. The view was breathtaking, all my tiredness went away. It was so beautiful and it was worth it!"
Top of Jeju Island,One of my best spot in Jeju. We went in July end and the climate was very very hot. We were sweating like anything and in the mid way my wife said lets go back but i was like we have to go. But when we reached at the top it was so beautiful around. I forgot the stairs and all our exertion was gone. The view is so astonishing and it definitely looks like a world heritage.Tip: Do keep lot of water if visiting in summer.This peak has lot of stairs (not advisable old person or for heart patient).
"Worth the climb, but beware of crowds in the busy season","The climb up to the crater of this old volcanic cone is not for the faint of heart, but it is worth it! At the top you get a 360 degree view of the coast, along with the bragging rights for the climb. Beware, though of the summertime crowds. I climbed on a weekend in November and it still felt a bit on the crowded side. The stairs are in good shape and sturdy, as are the lower, ramped sections."
Must Visit,A very scenic places and you must definitely plan this for your visit in Jeju. The view is so attractive but be prepared for some walking.
Must Visit,"Your visit to Jeju is not complete without visiting seongsang ilchulbong. A very wide area with great views. Try hike up to the peak, the trail is well maintained so it's not realy hard to get to the peak, but I still need few stop to get there."
Beautiful world wonder,We went up at 6am in the morning to see the sunrise. With cold rainy weather the event was less romantic than expected but well worth and good fun for us. We went up with our 3yr old boy. The way up is very well prepared and suitable for children who like walking/climbing a bit. We carried out son partly and party he walked. Well Organised tourist attraction.Entrance fee is only W2000.Have fun!
Jeju Must GO!!,One of natures most beautiful landmarks!! This hill rose from the volcanic craters beneath the sea and cooled down to become a combination of a cliff rock by the sea on one side and a green hill on the other.
Sunrise view? It's Seongsan Ilchulbong!!,"The journey to Seongsan Ilchulbong is very challenging as we need to drive following the traffic which is sometimes 70km/h, 60km/h, 50km/h..camera is everywhere..hahaha..But luckily we arrive at the right time :)The scenery is very beautiful especially when the sun is arising and our picture is like in the drawing."
Worth a Visit,"It was raining with some strong winds when we got there. Nevertheless we decided to buy a poncho and went ahead with the climb which is a manageable 180 m.The climb up is relatively easy even for most elderlies as there are proper stairs along the way.Apart from the crater, you can see the surrounding areas and the sea from the top. The crater itself is covered by vegetation so you might want to tone down any expectation of a spectacular view. We spent about 15 min at the highest point and start our descend after that.Another attraction nearby is the female divers where they have scheduled performances every day if I remember correctly. We didn’t go for that due to the weather. But I’m sure it would be interesting."
breathtaking scenery,It only take a 1 hour to 1 1/2 hour to top of the Mt. but view is awesome. They close aroud 6:00 pm. entrance fee is 2000 won per person.
Best Place to View Sunrise,"First and foremost, you need to find a place to stay nearby the Sunrise peak as you need to wake up early to climb up in time to view the sunrise. It should take around 20-30 minutes to reach the top. It's quite cold and windy up there during autumn time so bring along a wind breaker. Once you are up there, just wait until you see the dark sky suddenly light up, then you will see the most marvelous sunrise you ever seen."
Sunrise Peak in Jeju,"This is my favorite place whenever I go to Jeju. You can walk up to the peak for forty minutes where you can see the East Sea of Jeju. From there, you can leave for Cow Islet on a cruise, another destination in Jeju. This place is famous for beautiful sunrises."
Magnificent ,"the view was great! we climbed our way up to the top and when you looked across, it is just like a endless sea boundary view. the wind was relatively strong but stilll it is worth the walk"
Magnificent view,Breathtaking scenery. Lovely walk up. Many stops to catch your breath and look around the amazing place. Absolutely worth the visit.
Exhilirating Walk,Really loved this. It was a relatively easy climb that only took an hour or so at a relaxed pace. It is uphill so it can take the wind out of you but there are plenty of rest stops. The view from the top is majestic. I totally get why Jeju is a natural wonder! 
Worth for great view!,"According to the tour guide, she told us it will take 25 mins to reach the top. But we took more than that. Never mind just walk slowly and take short break in between. Feeling wonderful when reach the top. The sea view is perfect. Front side u can see the houses. I love the Back side view. "
spectacular sunrise view!,Be sure to witness the sunrise view. Its worth the climb to the top.entrance fee is 2000won. Wear comfortable shoes preferably sneakers 
Beautiful views!,"The hike up was tougher then we expected. The stairs are steep and most of the time there are no railings to hold on to. For someone with asthma like me, might need to take longer than the usual 20mins up. But the view it all worth it, a little achievement for me ;p There's quite a few pit stops along the way, go slow and enjoy every bit of it. Not sure if it's just me, somehow I feel the descending trail might be easier to ascend... "
Nice short hike,This site is one of the most popular places in Jeju so be prepared for the crowds of Chinese tours. The hiking course is all paved and has a lot of steps. The site says it takes around 55 minutes round trip. Of course this is just an approximation. I found the course to be pretty easy and it only took me 15 minutes to reach the top of the crater. At the top there is a large deck like area to sit and take a rest. The walk down has some beautiful spots for pictures overlooking the island. At the base there are a lot of different restaurants but they all offer the same food. Not a lot of options  
Exquisite ... worth getting up before sunrise,"We went there for sunrise, which was a short drive from our hotel. It's green, refreshing and pleasant for the view of its surroundings. The view of the city and ocean from the top is ‪‎breathtaking‬‬‬. It was quite crowded with Koreans and tourists. Take a slow walk to enjoy the surroundings."
The east side in Jeju,This Seongsan Ilchulbong is on the east side in Jeju. It should be the best to visit it when the sun rises. We came here in the afternoon and it was crowded with tourists.
Ilchulbong Peak Jeju,"‪‎Seongsan Ilchulbong Peak‬‬‬ (means Sun rise on a mountain), has been added to ‪UNESCO World Heritage‬‬‬. It rose from under the sea as a result of ‪‎Volcanic Erruption‬‬‬. The top of it looks like a gigantic ‪‎crown‬‬‬. It's green, refreshing and awesome for the view of its surroundings. The view of city and ocean from the top of it is ‪‎breath taking‬‬‬. Such a beautiful sight that one would like to lose himself into it."
20 min to go up to the look out point,"We went there for sunrise. We just took 20 minutes to reach the look out points and waited for the sun rise, but since the route is steep and made up of only stairs, a more relaxed walk should be planned.Turn right to the farthest end after descending from the look out where the outer landscape of this tuff cone can be seen clearly.Mind there are two flights of stairs. One for uphill and one for downhill.There are ""diving women"" shows at 1330 and 1500 if the weather is good.2000 won for adult admission."
Awesome view!,"It's an easy climb to the top, and there are various stops for you to take pictures. The view was spectacular and you can see Jeju island stretching out below you. You can even spot the hazy outline of Mt Halla from there."
Sunrise peak,"Be prepared to walk and climb and climb and climb up steps.Not diffcult but quite a way up.Good walking shoes, warm clothing and water (maybe some small snacks too) needed.There r also an different area where u can check out the Jeju women divers.Also check out the local restaurants around this attractions...They serve very good seafood food / BBQ meat.I had some very good abalone porridge and seafood soup along some BBQ meat. "
Amazing views,"This happened to be our favorite place even though we got up early to see the sunrise but the clouds blocked the sun. It was still beautiful and the surrounding area is gorgeous. There are so many birds and flowers to see. Many photo ops. After climbing you might be tired, but when you descend make sure you go to where the little beach is. It's gorgeous there. "
Highlight of our Visit,"2 days in Jeju, this was probably the highlight of our trip. We didn't for the sunrise/sunset, but came in the middle of the day. The place was packed with tourist, but it didn't take away from the beauty of the place. The is a fairly long climb of a series of stairs to get to the top. But totally worth it. On our way down, we were able to catch the women divers head out, which was a nice treat."
No pain No gain ;),"It is one of the best place in the world where you can watch sunrise. Even you have to wake up early, have a tiring stair climb and difficult to get clear whether even in summer ; if you ever go to Jeju island, here is one of a place where you must go. On the way Good scenery to enjoy also. In return don't miss the chance of fisherwomen's diving coast and have great breakfast with fresh seafood in the "" haenyeo jib "" ."
Sunrise view was breathtaking!!,"This is a must if you have an hour to spend. The crater is so beautiful, and the sunrise was stunning. Steps are steep, but worth the 25 minute walk up."
Wake up and go see the sunrise !,"We woke up at 3am for this and didn't regret it. It was really quite awesome. We drove in the wee hours of the morning for 1.5 hrs to get there, before hiking up for about 40mins to get to the viewing deck where there are seats to see the sunrise. To best enjoy this, be well prepared and equipped for the journey. We slept early at about 9pm the previous night because we knew we had to wake up at 3am. Prepare bread for breakfast on the road because you will need the energy for the hike. Wear proper walking shoes to make it easier to climb up. Remember to check the sunrise timing the night before, set your gps early and accurately if you are driving. If you need help with Korean gps or not sure if you got the right place, always ask your hotel or hostel host to help you set it right the night before. Charge and prep your cameras, go early to get a good spot, because you are going to get some really awesome sights of the sunrise at this spot. Definitely go for this if you are in Jeju. Not to be missed for the world! "
Beautiful place and good scenary,"First and foremost, bring good walking shoes. You will need to hike up the hill to have a good view. There are many stalls at the base of the hill, before you pay to go into the entrance. As this location is near the sea, it is rather windy. A windbreaker may be required depending the time of the year you are travelling.Lots of toilets around, so there's no worry about needing it.There are many tourists as well as locals visit this scenic spot. Bring you camera as well. Note: This location is open depending on weather."
The reason of visiting Jeju,A short climb to the top of the top of the hills for the crater view. Be sure to wear comfortable shoe and small bottles of water as it involve steep stairs. Recommended to go in the morning to avoid tourist congestion and ugly scene (Chinese tourist spitting around like nobody business)
"Amazing sights, beautiful nature",The walk to the crater is definitely worth the visit. Going up is fairly convenient as the stairs are not too steep. You should make it in about 30-40 minutes to the summit (normal speed and provided you skip the platforms from where you have a nice overview).
A must see and worth the climb,"A very long and tiring climb if you are not used to climbing. There's lots of people both locals and tourists climbing along so you will definitely be motivated to continue climbing. Tip: bring sunglasses, pack light, grab a snack and bring a bottle of water, most importantly wear comfortable sports shoes. Just climb slowly and take a break along the way as you need so that you are not overly tired out. If you are thinking of combining this attraction with other nature sites that require ample walking or climbing, do take note that this attraction may already be rather tiring... the view and wind at the top is worth it, in my opinion. You do not see the bird's eye view you see online but nonetheless you see the vast greenery and top down view of the scenery below. "
One of new 7 wonders of Nature,"The weather was extremely good and the scene was nice.Only have 2 hrs to walk this time, will definitely climb up if i have a chance to go again.Recommended to go in the morning, less tourist and more fresh air."
Breathtaking & unforgettable- my favorite part of the trip,"This was the most fascinating and beautiful experience during my two week stay in South Korea. The long, winding path to get to the coastline to see the Women Divers Show is gorgeous from beginning to end. The mist hovering over the black volcanic sand was unlike anything I have ever seen. I never wanted to leave. The hike up to Sunrise Peak was sweaty but worth it. The long, windy path to get the the top of the peak is fairly easy to walk and offers many wonderful views along the way. The fog was too dense to see anything from the very top, but I'm still glad I did it. This was such an amazing part of my trip; one of my most fond travel memories ever."
Great scenery of new 7 wonders of Nature,"Seongsan Ilchulbong(Sunrise Peak) is one of the special places that people visit to see the sunrise as each old year turns to the new. It is listed the world heritage as 7 wonders of nature. It was formed during volcano erupted under the ocean. One thing to keep in mind is that it is not easy to climb as it rises to 182 meters above sea level, with a steep slope. If decide not to go to the top, the base of it scenery is great too."
Good clamber,Well worth climbing up. Lots of selfie sticks in evidence. Music and commentary on the way up a bonus. Legs hurt for a couple of days afterwards - do your stretches!
A million Chinese tourists for a so-so view,"They will be 1 million Chinese tourists there to join you on your hike up the stairs to the peak. We didn't go for the sunrise which is supposed to be beautiful. That said, the views from the peak are so-so. Hallasan offers much better views (but it's far more challenging).This place is worth stopping by if you aren't pressed for time on Jeju. I'd recommend arriving early in the morning before the hordes of Chinese tourists show up."
great experience.,"I am not really good at hiking, but this is doable. In less than an hour, you can reach the top for magnificent views of the coastline. Too bad we missed the sunrise, but this hike is still worthwhile. "
Nice Long Climb but Well Worth It,"it is a long walk up to the top of this peak, but the views are remarkable. Bring water and be prepared to make the long climb. Parking is difficult so go early or take a tour bus."
It's known as Sunrise Peak for a good reason,Not to be missed. The view is out of this world. We had the unfortunate experience of running into fog but it was still well worth the trip.Tip: Check the sunrise time and weather before making the trip. Be flexible with the travel plans so that you can arrange to visit another day in the case of bad weather (rain/fog)
Do not miss the surise!,"The view is quite amazing even after the sunrise, but its worth to compromise your sleep for the sunrise! It takes about 20min to the top and bit steep yet not too much even for young children and senior citizens."
A World Natural Heritage site,"The volcano is an impressive sight from the car-park. Get ready for the steps up 180 metres to the top. Be prepared to climb, climb, climb!As you ascend, the view is the best reward, and from the top you have a commanding panorama.Time it at sunrise or at sunset if you can - we went at sunset: it was remarkable and very moving to see the sun disappear behind the mountains."
"Best attraction of juju, at night","I was there to see the sunset, which was really amazing. The entry was closed but we went to the volcano anyway. I recommend going there after Udo island."
A beautiful thing to do in a morning.,"There is a small fee to enter the area, I think around 2-3000W. Once you are inside the park, you can hang out on the paths, admiring the rolling green fields, or head up some few hundred stairs to the top of the little mountain and look at the crater. The little mountain was formed by a volcanic eruption a long time ago and around the rim of the crater there are 99 'peaks' which they call the crown. That's cool. I think that's cool.After you have taken an inappropriate amount of selfies you can head back down to a small beach area and watch traditional women divers...diving. There is also a small black stoned beach by the women divers which you can walk along and admire the beautiful black stone of the small mountain, which is Seongsan Ilchulbong.We travelled there by public transport and it wasn't difficult at all. "
Great walk and views,Went there as part of a cruise ship itinerary. It is a great walk and views. Avoid if raining or cloudy. The walk to the top of what is known in English as Sunrise Peak is quite strenuous and involves a lot of stairs. There are rest stops along the way. There are no lifts. It can get quite windy so jackets are required. There is a town centre area at the base with restaurants and shops.
Family Hiking Outing,"We thought our little ones and older ones would not be able to make it up the peak, but they did it! The view from the summit is spectacular, a reward for a short but steep hike."
A beautiful crater surrounded by the amazing view of the sea and the land of the eastern Jeju island,"I have heard people said the sunrise from the crater is magnificent. But, I have visited Seongsan Ilchulbong in the afternoon and it was just awesome! Thanks to the wide green field surrounded by the dark blue sea and cover with the bright blue sky! It was so relaxing there hearing the wave sound and feel the wind blowing pass through me. Hiking to the top of the crater would be good too, but you may need at least 2 hours to walk around the area."
Stunning and gorgeous panoramic view,"Sunrise Peak, a nature's masterpiece of volcanic crater that shaped like a fortress. The weather was very cooling and it was a relaxing climb up to the summit with well maintained flight of stairs and lush green lawn. The hiking trail was just plain climbing up steps and was not a difficult one though as you ascended higher, you would have to take a short rest to take a deep breath before scaling up further.The reward at the summit was the strong cooling wind that constantly blushed at my face and the beautiful panoramic view of the enchanting cliffs and the surrounding beaches and lowlands. While we really enjoyed the climb, the misty and cloudy weather reduced the sharpness and clarity of our photographs. I descended and wandered down to the sea beach that was studded with pieces of natural sea pebbles and rocks and the scenery looked photogenic with the towering crown crater looming at the background. It was also a marvelous view standing at the edge of the slope looking down the cliff and seeing the strong waves splashing against the cliff walls. As we look up at the volcanic crater among the beautiful pinkish flowers that grew at the entrance, the sight of this Sunrise Peak was awesome. We took a group photo at the entrance of the attraction with a rock embossed with the words: `Sunrise Peak' in Chinese. Just immersed in the tranquility and serenity of this beautiful place and let those soothing, awesome and stunning sights filled up your eyes and relieved you of all the stresses and anxieties that had wreaked havoc in your body system. With nature, your body will heal and harmonize by itself. If there is an opportunity, I would like to visit to this place again and stay longer."
I am small compare to this nature wonder,"Don't talk, just feel yourself on the walk way to clim to the top. Open your eyes and record the scene to your soul. It will treat your mind, very well. Don't forget your water bottle. Be careful when taking your selfie."
"A crater, a black sand beach and the Haenyeo in one location","This is a beautiful volcanic crater well worth visiting. It doesn’t take too long to reach the top from the entrance (despite the sometimes steep stairs). The views are magnificent as you ascend, from the summit, as well as when you descend. Plus there are various volcanic rock formations that you can appreciate along the way, both ascending and descending (the two paths are different). The crater is full of trees and grass of a very unique shade of green (I’ve seen this shade of green only in the vegetation of other extinct volcanic craters such as the ones in Tanzania). There are platforms to sit on at the summit from where you can appreciate the view. After descending, make sure to visit the cove where you can meet the Haenyeo or the traditional fisher women of Jejudo. The way to the cove is clearly marked with signboards and it’s only a couple of staircases down to the beach. The Haenyeo put up a performance twice a day, which is very touristy but interesting nevertheless. You can buy all kinds of fresh seafood from them and ask them to prepare it for you to eat at the restaurant. But it’s mostly eaten raw / semi-raw with various sauces and the typical side dishes. The sea weed is particularly good, which you get as a side dish. There is unfortunately no English menu. If you don’t want to eat raw seafood, after picking your seafood portion at the entrance, take it to the counter inside the restaurant and ask that it be stir-fried (“pokkum” in Korean). Beware that even when it’s stir-fried, it’ll still be more on the raw side than the fried side. The black sand beach in the cove is also a treat. If you look closely and attentively, you’ll find all sorts of marine life among the rocks, in the pools and on the sides of the mini cliffs facing the beach. "
Astonishingly beautiful views and delicious abalone!,"The hike is very easy to do-there are properly built steps. We went even though it was raining, thankfully the sky cleared up in a bit, and the view of the volcanic crater fringed by the sea was gorgeous! We even saw some wild horses. On climbing down, near the sea, we chose some fresh abalone which were then cooked right then-fresh and succulent. "
Awesome volcanic mountain on Udo Island,You get great views from this volcanic mountain. Udo Island is charming and there are buses that take you around and make stops at natural attractions like the jagged coastline and rocky beaches. It can be crowded though.
Eye opening and soul pleasing!,"Excellent view and atmosphere! A long steep (with stairs) and challenging climb up the inactive volcanic island mountain that earns you good exercise and satisfaction! You can already enjoy the picturesque surroundings at the foot of the mountain with different views and you can buy some souvenir there and also enjoy a short horse ride (not free of course). If you are there on a sunny day, do buy some popsicle or ice-cream to go up.  There are entrance fees for the entrance as well. However, it is well worth it once you reached the top. It is fantastic to be on top looking down to the inactive volcano crater and enjoy the view of the sea that looks like touching the sky. You can literally feel like you are touching the sky too! The best time to go there will be during sunrise! Don't forget to take a selfie with the mountain height indicator board to boast your achievements! Oh, and just right before you reach the top, please take a look at the back downhill at the interesting look of the city below and take a selfie and also take some nice selfie around you.  On the way down, there is the fishing village where the you can enjoy the seafood while watching the women divers catch clamps and oyster. There are some fiexed timing but I have already forgotten the timing.  Seongsan Ilchulbong is indeed a must visit destination everytime you arrive in Jeju!"
Quick hike for a great view,"I wasn't expecting to have to walk up this thing, but I guess that should have been obvious to me. It was a hot and panting walk, but it was not that long. It was a sunny day, which made for great views, but not for a cool walk. I had JUST MISSED the show with the women divers, I guess it is at 1:30 and 3:00 daily. Nice panorama at the top, the view is certainly impressive.One other thing I liked a lot about this is that it is a fairly touristy area, which meant that most restaurants I passed had pictures and/or English on the menu outside and inside the restaurant, making it easier to order food,"
beautiful hike and not too hard,"we wanted to go early to catch the sunrise but we were discouraged to do so as it can often be cloudy in the morning (i.e. no view) Plus I have two teen boys who like to sleep. We decided to do it mid-day, in august. We brought plenty of water and made it up in no time. Lots of steps but well worth it. And we weren't alone :)"
Picturesque views,"A must see when on Jeju Island. The trail to the top is well maintained and well build. Gets a bit steep at some points. If you're going doing the summer, as i did brings som water. It gets very hot and humid."
Gorgeous views!,"We hike around the crater on a very windy day and though the weather wasn't great, the views were beautiful. Hike down the side to see the historic women divers and their fresh catch then go up to the top to enjoy Jeju from above. It's not a serious hike and there are stairs with railings all the way up."
Great Scenery Hiking the Peak,"When we arrived at the Peak, the hiking trail appeared quite intimidating because of the height and length of the trail. However, once we started up the trail, we were presently surprised that the trail was quite easy actually - only a lot of steps on a very well maintained trail. The views on the way up and at the top were fantastic (see photos)! This is a must place to see in Jeju."
UNESCO World Heritage! Nice view on hill top!,Another UNESCO World Heritage you should visit!This place is a peak form from previous volcanic eruption!I was allocated about 1 hour by the driver to went up all the way to the top hill and come down. Feel little bit rush. This place definitely should spend about 2-3 hours to enjoy the natural scenery in this place! 
Beautiful views ,"The walk up was easy but definitely gets you sweating, even on a cool day. The weather was not on our side when we went up and it was cloudy at the top. We still had good views on the way up and down."
Breathtaking view after the hike.,"Worth a visit either for sunrise or sunset. Went there for sunset and it was amazing. Hike isn't very tough as there's proper stairs, railings and trails for ascending and descending."
Excellent hike up a unique mountain,"I know little about So Korea, and had never heard of Jeju before my cruise ship docked there so I was VERY pleasantly surprised by this lovely park. I enjoyed hiking up the steep mountain and admiring the views. Although very popular, and fairly crowded, it was never unpleasantly so. The women divers in a little cove below were kind of interesting, but it was very crowded there. And, because I spent some of my limited time there, I didn't have enough time to make it to the top of the crater and back before my tour bus left so was sorry I'd wasted some of my time there instead of making it all the way to the top. "
must visit for natural beauty,We went here as per the recommendation on Tripadvisor. We wanted to go to Udo island and then come to see the sunset on this peak.since the ferry to Udo was cancelled due to rough sea and strong winds we had to change our plan and come to peak right in the afternoon.Since it was overcast and cloudy weather we could hike easily to the top. the 360 view from top is breathtaking.hiking trails is good. You can see the black sand beach and also see the jeju fishing lady show.
Good View,this place is quite hard to be accessed. the best way to reach this place is rent a car or bike if you have international driver license. you need strong stamina to explore whole and some area need climbed up.
always excellent,not too bad to climb up as it looks. definately top 5 things to do in Jeju.I go there everytime I go to Jeju island.Always nice view and great feeling on the top.
Try to get further away and take picture,It's very crowded on the weekend as usual. I was on my olle trail #1 trekking and passed by this almost at the end point of the trail. The view is so much better from afar than close up. Try walk to the beach side and I can guarantee you the beauty of seongsan is right in front of your lenses. And stairs hiking is awaiting for you there. Be ready for that :)
Excellent hiking trip,"I had a great time in here, trekking up to the top and can see beautiful picturesque of mountain, island, and ocean. A bit tired when you climb up from the bottom but well worth."
The best part of Jeju!,"180m to the top but more then worth it in the end. Taking the hike up the steps was quite a workout, so I highly suggest, prepare to break a sweat. My favorite part was taking pictures on the way down, there are many great picture opportunities. One thing I recommend is to take the extra steps down to the ocean, take your shoes off and enjoy the cool refreshing water. It is well worth it after after walking down."
Be prepared to hike,"Seongsan Ilchulbong is very beautiful, but one thing our tour guide didn't mention was the difficulty of the walk up. You walk up a path and as the terrain gets steeper, the path turns into a bunch of stairs that you have to climb. If you are not physically able, this might be a difficult destination, but if you are able to reach the top the view is worth it.Here you can also see the haenyeos or Jeju women divers and learn a little bit about their history.For those of you who want to be one with nature and enjoy a good hike, I recommend this place."
Nice view after a short climb,Took about 20 minutes to complete the climb to the peak. The view was pretty nice at the top. Really worth the short climb. 
Sunrise with a blink,I totally missed the sunrise at this point despite setting the alarm at 4am. But the trip to the peak in the afternoon was refreshing enough. I feel that it has heighten my spirit to cope with what I always wonder. Hiking up the mountains has been what I love most. But seeing the end is really rewarding. I believe that the sunrise marks it all.
The sunset view is brilliant too!,"We went Seongsan Ilchulbong in the evening, even though it's known as the Sunrise Peak. The hike up was a little tiring for us as we had previously scaled up a few other peaks the same day. There are quite a few resting spots around, so rest assured you can always catch a breather before ascending the next flight of steps.Bring enough water with you as drinks sold along the way can be quite expensive!The view at the peak is surreal. The sun sets rather slowly in Jeju, so you'll have ample time to scale up and take multiple shots of the place.I will definitely visit the peak again. This time, I'll go for the sunrise. :)"
Not Just for the Geologists! It's a Great Park!,For nature lovers. For education. For a good climb. For the general beauty of the grounds and the Fantastic views from above. The views are your reward for making it to the top. Fitness level determines the duration of the climb up the steps.At the base is the Women Diver's attraction. Showtimes are 13:30 and 15:00 hrs. And they serve their catches in their little restaurant.
Hard work but worth the effort,Glad we didn't go for sunrise as would have missed it! Harder climb for a desk girl than expected but very much worth the effort. Beautiful views. 
Beautiful view,"We visited this sunrise pick which is one of the Natural wondes of the world during first week of May. It is easy to climb, with lots of opportunities to take rest if you need. The views during climb are simply superb. While we were climbing we saw amazingly shaped cloud formations. After all the efforts of climbing, the views from the peak are beautiful. We could not see the sunrise, but I am sure it would be worth the early getting up.I will strongly recommend visit to this place."
Nice spot view from the top,We went there and reach to the top at noon time. So it's pretty hot! So I'd like to suggest you to come early in the morning. The view from the top is very nice. The way to go up is not that tough and you will reach to the top sooner than you expect.
An UNESCO Triple Crown place,"It is an archetypal tuff cone formed by hydrovolcanic eruptions upon a shallow seabed about five thousand years ago. Situated on the eastern seaboard of Jeju Island and resembles a gigantic ancient castle, this tuff cone is 182 meters high, has a preserved bowl-like crater. There are two hiking trails to reach the peak , take the white path uphill and the orange path downhill. You just follow the crowd and the signages along the trail. During May and the coming summer, you do not need a jacket or pullover as it will be hot and you will sweat a lot on the climb up. Wear covered sports shoes and a cap / hat. The first part of the hike is the easiest and the least steep. The rest of the path comprises steps of varying steepness. The final stretch gets very steep. Along the hiking trail, there are benches and pavilions to rest. Take a sip of water, rest your aching legs before proceeding . Toilets are available along the way. From the peak, you can see beautiful landscapes of Jeju island and do take a photo with the signage saying you are at Sunrise Peak. It took us 30 minutes to reach the top. The downhill walk was much easier, just follow the wooden stairs meandering its way down. At the bottom, you can go for drinks at the cafetarias."
Enjoy the sunrise and climbing up the peak,"Very enjoyable place to track. The sunrise was memorable. You will like it. A lot of travelers, very popular."
great for hiking,Views. Convenience for hikers. Even bathroom in the middle of hiking trails! 
friendly hiking track,"it is very easy and friendly track to reach the peak, but for me the beautiful things about Seongsan Illchulbong are scenery from everywhere. so, I made a little tour by walking by from beaches till Saepjikoji and to Udo island. Never get missed from sunrise to sunset, everything is beautiful. is not wrong to choose stay near the Hills, Goseong-ri is perfect village to stay.But, if you just a few time to visit is good to stopping by. My wife loves here in spring time, lots of canola and pretty flower in the green green grass.You will found starbucks, convenience market, and lots of food."
This place is definitely worth visiting (:,"A very pretty place with some hiking and climbing but it gets pretty cold with the cold wind blowing as you climb higher.. so, be prepared even if you think March won't be too cold! This place is definitely worth visiting (:For full review: http://wanderer.summeree.com/travel/korea/jeju/seongsan-ilchulbong-sunrise-peak/"
Easy Hike Beautiful View,"This is a good hiking trail for those with young kids. Easy and yet the view is stunning. It is very touristy but you can still get that opportunity to have your photo. The stairs make it easy climbing the peak. We were just in time to view the last sunset of the year and it was amazing. Worth it to spend overnight in the area. We also spent the new year's eve and again a wonderful experience to spend it with the koreans. There was a bonfire, then some fantastic fireworks and at the same time it was snowing. An experience we will never forget. "
Number one attraction in Jeju island,dont be afraid of the distance to the top. just go ahead. it doesnt take too long. i think it was around half hour for people to
Stunning View,An awesome stunning view! This is the most beautiful peak tht ive came across so far :)Will visit again
Stunning nature but very touristy,"Nice nature, very touristy. Terrible female divers ""show"" is arranged there. Stairs up to the crater was well made. Hundreds of chinese tourists taking selfies."
Nice view & easy hike,"a-must-see place in jeju-do.easy hike, must try egg puff w/honey. yummy~great view on top of seongsan."
Great View,"A must-see place when you visit Jeju. It may a bit tiring to climb until the top, but the view is breathtaking. The hiking track also made it easy to climb because they've built a stairs until the peak. Try to visit early in the morning, because around 9 am, the crowd starts to gather, so it may be a little difficult to take a picture without some people intrude in the background. In addition, if the weather forecast is great, try to see the sunrise from the peak. Too bad it's cloudy when we visited, so we didnt try to see the sunrise."
Nice view from the top,"Nice view while walking along the way to the top, view of the sea and mountains, cold wind gets to blow away all worries and agony. Enjoying walk up the mountain, it is a place where you must visit."
Wonderful experience,"It's a must visit. We decided not to go for the sunrise as the weather forecast rain and we went for the normal trekking up the peak at 730am. Thank god we did not went for the sunrise as it was very cloudy but rain was later the day.It took us 30mins to get to the peak and another 30mins to get down. We do stop a few times to gasp for breath as we both are non-routine exerciser. No toilet available on the way up the peak, so just do what you need to do right after the entrance.Suggest to do your trekking as early as possible before the tour group arrives if you can force yourself out from the bed.As soon as we reached the ground, it was flooded with tour group and it will definitely block your view if you want to take photographs at the peak if you enter the same time as them.Tips: it is very windy n chilling at the foot of the peak but by the time you made it to the top, you are sweaty n warm. (I travel in May, around 18degree at that point of time)"
Definitely a must-see place during your trip to Jeju!,"After climbing the stairs for the view of the lush, plant-filled centre of the crater, you should definitely walk along part of the black sand beach that arcs around to the “glass house.” You’ll see some amazing views of Seongsan Ilchubon there, and your pictures won’t be filled with random tourists. There are also bits of sea glass scattered along the shore, shells, and if you walk down the beach far enough, a beautiful, large ledge of lava covered in green moss you can walk on and explore. It was really easy to get to the crater by bus from Jeju-si, and it only took about 75 minutes."
magnificent,if u have time to come here..climb all those stairs on the way is definitely worth to do..the niew from the top is breath taking
A must see!,"A truly beautiful part of the island - very touristy, but I can understand why. Definitely worth the climb for the views. We travelled there from Seogwipo by public bus (about one hour) and it was no problem. Worthwhile to see! "
Beauty of Nature~Must go~,"It's not that high from what I thought that we need to climb. There are many rest place that you can have a rest on the way up to the top. It's really worth it, the scene is so beautiful. At the foot of the mountain on the way climb down, there are lady divers who sells seafoods which can have a try."
Must see,"At east spot of Jeju. Takes about 1.5 hour bus ride from the intercity bus terminal. Free entrance. Although the peak is only 180 metres, it's still challenging to climb because of the steepness. Very beautiful view along the way. The ocean and the mountain are all visible. Highly recommend."
Lovely view,"The climb to the top is relatively easy and there are several lookout points along the way. The view isn't spectacular, but it is pleasant. After your descent, don't miss the haenyo (women divers), who perform daily at 1:30 and 3 pm. After catching fish with minimal equipment, they sell it and serve it right there. "
Must go!,Love the view at the top and the peacefulness feel before the tourist buses arrived.Hate that it gets filled with noisy tourist after mid-morning.
Nature of landscape,"Early at 9.00am we arrived and was chilly, wet and misty. For those having knee and walking problems don't attempt to go up as it is quite steep when coming down. It takes 45mins for those who are fit but give 1hour within your own limit."
Nice view & Seawomen show,"Went there after having lunch nearby.View: spectacular view even before the climb. Nice view at the coast where the Seawomen show is held. Once you reached the summit, you can view the island & the sea but the sky was not clear when we visited.Seawomen Show: they sang a song before entering the sea. Not much to see them in action coz it's not the actual location where they will dive for abalones, octopus etc. We saw from afar there were Seawomen resting on the rocks nearby the Oedolgae rock.The climb: it's a pathway with steps so it's not hard to climb. Along the way there are many stops/benches for the elderly to rest. Just don't rush it if you bring your parents/grandparents along."
"Named sunrise peak, but regardless of whether you are catching the sunrise, it's worth the climb!","Another UNESCO site in Jeju, hence there are always a lot of people there. But the climb is actually not that difficult, as the way is nicely paved with stairs, and there are quite a few resting places along the way. Took us around 1 hour to climb up to the peak and down again, but other than climbing up to the peak you can also go down to the seaside to see the diver's performance! Unfortunately, when we were there the sea was rough, so there was no performance. "
Easy climb,Its a 180-200m mountain which was formed by an extinct volcano.There are too many people on the way up to the mountain so you have to be patient when climbing.
Worth the hike to the Peak,"Seongsan Ilchulbong, also called “Sunrise Peak” is located on the eastern end of Jeju island and is an ideal spot for watching sunrise. Hiking up Seongsan Ilchulbong is quite manageable for us as it takes about 30 minutes to reach the top with stops to take photographs and admire the view. There are proper steps leading to the top and it is very well maintained and well marked with signages but is quite steep at some spots of the trail. There are two hiking trails to reach the peak of the Seongsan Ilchulbong. On the way up to the Seongsan Ilchulbong’s peak, one can enjoy the scenery of the surrounding coastal landscape of Jeju and the unique rocks along the way. On that day when we were there, the place was thronged by bus loads of tourists and going up the peak may be time consuming, if one is not fit. So be prepared to spend at least 1.5 hours here. At the base, there are shops selling dried seaweeds, local delicacies, drinks, ice-cream and local handicrafts. Once you have seen this place, you will know why it is UNESCO’s heritage site - the 7 New Wonders of the World!"
"Amazing view, inside and out","Amazing view of the city as well as of the nature inside the peak.- 20 to 40 min to go up- pack water- pack sport shoesPlenty of rest areas on the way, so you can take your time"
"Worth to visit, prepare to walk steps","This is my 2nd time to visit this peak since 10 years ago, the place had improved with better walking pathway with separated up and down trails. Much easier to walk the steps even though it still test your stamina. Crowded during noon with full of tourists however, the scenery on the peak is still amazing. Very windy and cold. Near coastline, can see the nice cliff formation. Good place to take pictures."
Amazing climb,"The volcano look really scenic when looking from far away. This is also a part of UNESCO world heritage site too. There are about 500 steps to the peak of volcano which is not that tired though because step are well built. The view from the top also worth climbing. The weather is great even it was winter, it is not too cold, about 5c."
20 mins climb up to see sun rise,"It's a beautiful view, worth the climb even though we didn't manage to see sun rise due to the cloudy day but the view is pretty. Have to walk up and be there before 5.30am. Depending on your fitness level, it can take 20-40 mins to climb the peak."
Never regretted,"Brought my baby (14 months old) along , climbed the stairs together, nice view, very good experience, awesome !"
Beautiful view and crisp fresh air!,"It is a great experience. However, during winter/transition from winter/rainy days it is very windy and cold so try to bring along windbreakers/coats.Note: stores at the foot of the crater sell stuff for twice the actual price!"
Breathtaking view after a challenging climb,"People who are not used to climbing will have an extremely hard time in going up the mountaintop, but rest assured that the climb will be worth it.One of the best views I have seen."
Beautiful Scenery,"The Seongsan Ilchulbong is a place of natural beauty, featuring many unique or rare landforms such as the tuff cone which can be witnessed at the peak. We went to this place in April, strong winds made the place a bit chilly.The climb was average difficulty, at the view at the top is not to be missed. The only regret was that it was kind of foggy at the time of my visit, so we could not fully appreciate the tuff cone. Still it was an amazing sight.Overall, recommended, especially for nature lovers."
Beautiful nature scenery,"A beautiful. Attraction must not miss. The 360 degree views at the top is wonderful. Beautiful secure, mountains, scenery cannot express by words."
Breathtaking.,"I'm always fascinated with natural wonders so visiting this place amuses me. For a more meaningful experience, try climbing the peak (only takes less than an hour). The pathway is safe since there are stairs that you can climb to but it gets steeper as it nears the peak so make sure you wear comfortable shoes. Choose a clear day for the climb because when it is foggy (like mine), you can't see the crater once you reach the peak. It's quite windy here (since it's near the sea) so make sure your skin is covered to fight off the cold. Even if you don't attempt the peak, the view is still great and you can take a lot of beautiful photos here.Do not buy here, especially beauty products as they are more expensive. Buy in the downtown area for cheaper prices."
Interesting and scenic,The view is magnificent! The haenyu women were modeerately fun to watch. Parking is atrocious! The walk to see the sights is rather difficult.
Beautiful Seongsan,"I choose to stay near to the peak so it only took us 5 mins to walk here. We didn't managed to see the sunrise as the weather was a great challenge. It was extremely windy and cold in the morning. Thus we came here at noon time. When we reach the foot of the peak, I could see that the whole peak was full of people climbing either up or coming down. The entrance fee is cheap, it cost only 2000won. The scenery was really beautiful, it worth coming here to take a look at the natural beauty."
It's amazing and the best of Jeju do,"It takes 1.5 hours from Jeju Intercity bus station to Seongsan IIchulbong, by bus 701. After 30 mins drive, you can see the blue sky and green sea outside of the windows. The admin fee is 200 0 KR but the great view is worth of it. You can see large grass ground and hike to the top. If there is sunshine, no doubt you can have wonderful pictures and experience even with a phone camera."
Good hike and wonderful view,"Seongsan Ilchulbong/Sunrise Peak (성산일출봉). Seongsan Ilchulbong, as with all natural formations on Jeju, was formed by hydrovolcanic eruptions about 5,000 years ago. Its volcanic cone is 600-meters wide and 90 meters tall, and its crated lined with 99 rocky spires that resemble a crown. In addition to its appearance, or rather, because of its appearance, it was name as one of the 7 wonders of nature in the world in 2011 (UNESCO Natural World Heritage). So needless to say, it would not be a surprise to see busloads of tourists at the carpark planning to make their way up to the peak.There are 2 suggested paths to reach the peak, where the view is said to be magnificent. I can’t remember which path we took, but the trail leading up to the peak was well maintained and quite manageable with proper steps to lead us along our way.However, despite there being steps, they were still steep, but at least the path was one of the most even paths that we had walked that day (e.g. no rocky paths nor muddy roads). The path uphill to Seongsan Ilchulbong comprises steps of varying steepness.For more photos and about my experience, please check out my blog: http://www.travelbytez.com/2015/02/seongsan-ilchulbongsunrise-peak.html"
great but...,"i'm afraid there is too much tourist even during the low season, i need to walk really fast for more tourist are coming and i don't even have time to really stop by and take a good look at the top"
Choose the right month to visit this beautiful mountain peak,"I went to Seongsan Ilchulbong (SunRise Peak) during Mar this year 2015. The weather is cold but bearable around Jeju. However, to climb this mountain is not a great feat for my mum (age 65) but the chilling wind is the one we are defeated.We wanted to visit this peak for sunrise but somehow we are late and lost on our way there. We went to Jongbong Beach and along the coast line it is also very nice to see. We did not catch the sun rise as there are none (due to foggy weather). As we are ascending, the crowd was descending and show enthusiasm although they did not get any view of the sun rise. The climb was nice as there are even wooden/stone steps to the top. Once you reached the top, you will see the beautiful crater which happens million years ago. The view over the edge is equally stunning. Definitely a recommended place to visit when you are in Jeju-Si. The ticket cost 2000KRW each.When you descend, you may see the ""Sea-Woman"" whom they called Haenyeo will perform at 1.30PM and 3PM only. We did not wait for the show as there are many Sea-Woman around the whole Jeju Island."
breathtaking view!,"We went just one hour and a half before closing time (7:30pm). At the counter, we were told that it took about 50-minutes for round trip until the top. It was huge and made my wife hesitated to climb it at first. But by seeing the surrounding scenery, and imagining on how awesome it will be from up there, we climbed the stairs about 40 minutes (also stopped for taking pictures since the scenery was too beautiful). We could see the night view when we reached the top. It was worth it :) the best scenery I have seen in Jeju."
Good landscape views,"Yes it is worth to go here, you need only 50 mins to complete this park. The scenes are very stunning along the coast, the cliff, the fields and the volcano landscape. The ladders to the crater is well constructed but don't expect too much about the view up there! trust me. "
dramatic geographic history,"Ilchubong has a dramatic history of formation. Some parts of the areas had been submerged underwater and lifted up while others sunk underwater over millions of years ago due to earth movements and volcanic activities. Even though the lower part slopes gently and make relatively fairly easy to climb the upper part is slightly steeper. Generally there are so many steps to reach the top,climbing can be pretty challengingfor the less fit. However, the view from the top is rewarding."
Wonderful sunrise!!,"You have to get up early to be on time.Around 20minutes to go to the top of the mountain, so it's not that difficult.But it's really cold at the top, and really many people are waiting for the sunrise there, so if u wanna take a seat, you must reach there early.If the weather allow, u can see the beautiful sunrise.It's really up to your luck whetherr u can watch a beautiful sunrise or not.Anyway it's wothty to go.If u are enjoying yourself in Jeju Island, u must stop by this fabulous Mt."
nice visit,"it was a very cold windy day we visited this place. climbed for about 30 mins to reach to the top to enjoy the scenery which is worth the climb. There are many people there but don't feel crowded at all. When you are in Jeju, make sure you visit this place, really beautiful"
Just Breathtaking,This is one of the reason why I want to visit Jeju because I want to see this beautiful place and I was not disappointed though I was a bit breathless climbing the top but everything was worth the view is beautiful and I would definitely go back to this place and probably spend a day just enjoying this breathtaking place. My one regret is that I did not get to see the sunrise so hopefully next time if I came to Jeju I would try my best to see the sunrise here...
Get ready to climb up the stairs for the stunning views,"Located at the eastern end of Jeju Island. It will be about 1hr - 1.5 hrs drive if you stay at the city centre to this stunning place. Advisable to travel early in the morning if you want to avoid the tourists. I drove from Yeha Guesthouse around 7am and arrived in Seongsan Ilchulbong about 8.10am. The area was still empty with only those coming with their cars and still lots of parking lots. However if you arrived around 10am onward, rest assured the parking space will be a challenge. The entrance fee is KW2000 per adult. If you intend to hike until to the top, please wear proper shoes as the stairs can be pretty challenging and steep on the way down. The hike will take about 50 minutes if you walk slow and steady. Can be shorter if you climb faster. During the winter season, you are lucky if you can watch the sunrise. When we were there, it was cloudy and the sun is rising behind the cloud, but still the view up there is beautiful. If you don't want to climb up to the top, you can still enjoy the beautiful scenery around the area. If the time permits, you can also catch the Jeju Woman Diver (Haenyo) in action on your way down from the Seongsan Ilchulbong performing at two timing 1.30pm and 3.00pm respectively. There is a separate trail that leads down to where the action is. I wasn't able to watch it as we are rushing to go to Udo Island.There are Starbucks & Dunkin Donut for you to stop for a cup of coffee while enjoying the views and few shops that sells souvenirs. However the price may be a bit expensive as compared to Dongmun Market.Return visit : A must...for a sunrise views!"
Very very busy and not that hard,I've not been up a volcano before and the view is worth itIt's really not that high though if you get any exercise... Just 200m of climb... Remember you are climbing a volcano and not a building so it is a little strenuous !Shame you cannot walk around a little more At the top ... And I couldn't see Hallasan on this particular day..
worth the pain,"we took tour to east of Jeju fm our guesthouse, Yeha. We intended to go to Seongsan Ilchulbong that why we were excited to know our time was perfect with Yeha tour. No idea that Seongsan Ilchulbong had sooo many stairs, we took a lot of stops before top. While we took rest, we turned back and saw beautiful view down the hill. Once we got on top, the view was so nice as well. It was worth it every single stair by looking the view from the top.We enjoyed our time to go down, windy and cold. We also enjoyed performance woman diver and saw directly what they collected fresh from the sea."
Beautiful view of Jeju and sea,"I like the view of the nature that surrounds this beautiful sunrise peak. The lush grass and the crashing waves against the cliff. The walkway was well built. What I didnt like was that as we had to start the climb quite early, it was pitch black and I was afraid of the darkness. So be sure to bring a torch and a jacket as it was raining and windy when I went in the morning. "
Not For the Weak Hearted,"TAKE NOTE: If you are not healthy and dont usually do cardio, the step up will be absolute hell for you. The only way you can circumvent the hellish experience is if you wake up extra early and take your own sweet time to traverse to the top.We woke up at 6am after checking sunrise at 7:20am, and was living in a hotel 2 minutes away. As we want to experience the whole sunrise, we rush up the rising path. Big mistake. By the time we're halfway up, I had visions of my 42km route march in 1.5 days during my army stint, and had to take frequent rest stops on the way up.Once you reach the top, you'll see nothing but the sea in front of you and while you're tired, you're also excited to witness the sunrise.Which you COULD... if it was a cloudless morning. The clouds will ruin your day. We didn't get to see anything in the end, as it was so cloudy and drizzling a bit, but after staying for an hour after sunrise, we did get to see a few peeks of sunrays.It only cost 2000 won so well worth the price, but definitely check the weather forecast first. It feels terrible to have almost burst your heart only to see nothing but clouds. I do imagine the sunrise is heavenly if you actually get to see it though."
Worth the pain,"I am really unfit and the hike up to the peak is painful to me. But once i reached the top, all of my pain seem to go away. The view of the sunrise is so beautiful. I know i will take longer time to reach the top so i begin the hike up earlier. I started at 5.30 a.m and reach the top after excruciating 1 hour."
Very cold in winter,The scenery was very beautiful. But it was very windy in winter. Choose your clothing wisely.You will need to hike to reach the top or you can also go to the beach by climbing down the stairs to buy some squid or oyster. They say that you can watch traditional diver at the beach. But it wasnt there when i arrive (I will be very amazed if there is a diver in that chilly winter)
Wow views - relatively easy climb,"This is the climb for the unfit too. It is relatively easy compared to Hallasan or Elephant Mountain in Taipei (not even half as difficult) and the views all the way up and down is amazing. We did the sunrise climb as we stayed overnight at Illchubong Hotel. From the hotel, it is about 20mins walk to the base - we had a car. There are many public buses that come to this spot. If you have 4of you, you can cheaply get a taxi to the spot for the morning climb.At the top, we did not see the amazing postcard view (aerial view?). If you wanted to take the sunrise with the illchubong Seongsan, you actually do not have to climb up the mountain. There is a huge area to view it as you drive up the highway.There are public buses to the entrance/ base of the mountain. There are 2 women divers performance which we missed due to the timing. It's 11 and 1 or 3pm. You can probably go to Udo island and be back for the late performance.Highly recommended to visit."
Awesome view,A quick 30 minute hike up to the crater and you are rewarded with some magnificent views. They were still building what looked like a viewing platform (October 2014) so it was a bit crowded at the top with limited room to move around. But the hike up is relatively easy with a well developed path. Definitely worth the stop.
Brilliant scenery,"500 steps to the summit, take your time to climb those steps if you are not physically fit. The scenery from halfway on is beautiful and the highlight of the climb. Once at the top, we expected something nicer than what we saw of the crater but photographs are actually nicer. Enjoy the climb and scenery awaiting you though."
A little exercise for a majestic view,My review is a little late but it's better late than never. We've visited this place when I was four months pregnant and I was able to hike up to the summit. This place is serene. It's breathtaking to see the wonderful view when you've reach the top. The kids love the lush greens at the hilly part of this place. It's very well-maintained. There are souvenir shops located at the entrance of the park.
"While climbing to the summit, please look back on. ","While climbing to the summit, please look back on. Scenery really beautiful. On the way to the summit three or four beautiful rocks, there are. It will take 1 hour for normal people of in their forties to take a round trip, on foot. There are many stairs. Enjoy the 'Haenyeoeuijip' on the beach, too. "
As great as awarded one of the new 7 wonders of nature,My most favourite place in Jeju with neatly built stairs and hand rails starting from the ground to the uppermost area. My group members are mixture of adults and elderly. All of us could manage to visit the top of this mountain!
Good little hike with a nice view,"I really liked this part of the trip. We hiked up to the top, and I am a five month pregnant lady so you can do it too! The view of the city below is the most interesting view you are going to get from the top of the crater. The top of the crater itself isn't that spectacular. It was very pretty and fun! Also we happened to be there around the same time as the lady divers so we watched that and it was pretty interesting. When we were there in December they were doing shows around 1:30 and 3:30. You should definitely come here. There are also little restaurants and shops at the bottom if you are hungry!"
Our favorite spot on Jeju Island,"We spent over 2 hours here just admiring the view and enjoying a very leisurely walk up and down Seongsan Ilchulbong. We didn't arrive until just before 9am but already it was packed with lots of tourist buses. If you want to miss the crowds then you definitely have to go at the crack of dawn. Having said that, we weren't too bothered by the tour groups as they would come and go in waves pretty quickly due to their limited time at the location. We sometimes had at least 5 minutes all to ourselves at the top to enjoy the view in peace.Wear comfy shoes! "
Nice view of the surrounding,"It was really pretty and there are horses which you can ride at the bottom. Climbing up includes of climbing up many flights of steep stairs which might be difficult for the elderly or the unfit(like me). It takes about 50 mins to go up and down. The view on top was nice but when i was there, there were some construction works on going and they chased us away if we were to stand at the peak to take pictures. Imagine climbing up all the way to the top just to get chased away. Not a gd feeling.At the bottom near to the sea, there is also the performance of the women divers at 1.30pm and 3.30pm. It was interesting to watch even though we were flooded by many china tourist. Be careful when walking on the rocks as it can be very slippery. There was also a small pile of shells that you can choose from and to bring home. You can also buy the seafood caught by the women divers and enjoy them at the cafe just beside."
Crowded & Packed Despite Cold Weather,"Plenty of visitors,an extinct volcanic crater on the eastern tip of Jeju about 182 feet splendid view from the peak,on the lower part is the famous sea woman house present oldest sea woman at the age of 90 plus year old and younger sea woman at the age of 50 years old continue to dive in the sea for living. The House of sea woman sell fresh oysters and abalones."
better from far away than to actually climb,"the peak itself is a great backdrop for photos...it looks a lot cooler from few hundred meters away...you can pay to climb it, but the crater itself doesn't offer anything spectacular..."
Beautiful views!,"Beauitful! I came in early August when it was quite hot and humid. The climb up was a bit strenuous in that weather, but the cool air at the top was our reward. The view from the top is stunning and easily my favorite view from the trip. Too bad when we reached the top, the entire peak was engulfed by a huge cloud and we could not see into the crater. Still, worth the short hike."
Worth the early morning and climb up,"Completely worth the early morning waking up to see the sunrise. It looks completely difference bathed in the early morning light than after the sun has arisen, so check when the sun rises and wake up early!Is it easy to climb up? My wife doesn't work out, and we took about 40 minutes to walk up the stairs, with occasional stops along the way. I do work out, and even I had to pause a little here and there - bring some water, you'll be glad you did. Otherwise, it's not really difficult, just takes a bit of stamina."
"Short walk, don't miss the women diver shows at 130 or 3pm","You can get here from Seogwipo on the 701 bus - costs 3,300 KRW each way and takes about 80 minutes. After the bus drops you off, turn off one of the streets to the right and keep walking until you find the parking lot and entrance way. There's a small exhibition before the ticket office, but there's not much in there, lots of photos and a little signage. There's also a water drinking fountain just outside if you need to fill up.Note there are no garbage bins, so you will need to take all rubbish away with you. Entrance fee is 2000 KRW. All well signposted and lots of steps. It will take about about 20 minutes to walk to the top. There are lots of places to stop and sit and take photos and there are lookouts at the top for photos in all directions. When you get to the top, all you can do it look around and come back down again. You're not able to walk around inside the cone or around the edges. (so yes we took our picnic back down again).When you walk back down, be sure to go to the small cove on the right hand side where you will see a (FREE) exhibition of women divers. This happens at 130pm and 3pm. Five older women divers took to the water, with their full old wetsuits on and 10 minutes later started coming back in with the octupus that they had caught. Only two caught some while we were there and came back out of the water clutching it, straight to the area where they sell the seafood that you can buy and take into the restaurant area to get it cooked for you.It's a pleasant way to spend an hour or so, but its a pain to make a specific trip here from Seogwipo (and longer from Jeju City), so plan something else around it."
Simply beautiful and amazing views for photo-taking!,"It was a chilly walk up the slopes but a must-visit place on your list if u do go to Jeju island.We had many lovely photos taken there, that we brought home and i look at them a lot."
A Must-Visit on Jeju Island,"If you are visiting Jeju Island, this is a place that you cannot miss.It was rather crowded when we were there on weekday late morning. According to our driver, it can get even more crowded in the afternoon.The hike can be done at your own pace, I expected the tuff cone / crater itself at the top to be more spectacular (like those tourism photos and pictures). However, it turned out just okay. Nevertheless, the hike up to the top was very enjoyable and views from the top was very nice. If you like nature, this place is worth a visit."
"Cherry blossoms package with Qodariyah Travel & Tour, Singapore.",This is one of the place i like most in South Korea. Time constraint prevented me from going yo the hill top crater.
Amazing view & good for hiking,"Really worth to win 'New 7 wonders of Nature' as the view there is amazing. From a geographic perspective, its formation letting us know more about the nature.Little hiking is good for our trip! "
Excellent place,"Seongsan Ilchulbong is a mountain, you can climb easily. There are very good 360 degree view. It is a paradise for Photographers. People in all ages can enjoy this place. With in 75 minutes, you can go to the peak of this moutain. In English they say Seongsan Sun rise peak. There are hotels near this mountain. You can go to Udo island from here. There are ferries which go to Udo island and without stopping it goes around Seongsan Ilchulbong. If you go to Jeju island then don't miss Seongsan Ilchulbong."
Must visit Unesco Heritage Site,"Do not miss the chance to climb up to the top (180m) to see the huge crater & Jeju view! it's definitely worth it ..the staircases might seems endless but it wasn't that high actually. it tooks us less than 30mins to reach the top and there are a few stops where you can catch a breath before continue to climb up again. Even my 4 years old nephew make it on top too. Going up and going down is 2 different route. Don't forget to get yourself mineral water at the convenient store before you climb up. you will need it.If you going over to the cliffs for the seaview, check out the Haenyeo performance. The performance hours are 1:30 p.m. and 3 p.m. twice a day during summer but we are out of luck we did not see any at the 3pm slot that day. Seongsan ilchulbong is sunrise peak - famous with sunrise from the cater! The gate is open 1 hour before sunrise for those who wish to watch sunrise from the top."
Wonderful view and fresh air in the morning!,"I really enjoy my visit to this site at Jeju island... Recommended for those who loves to take a short hike and enjoy sunrise... The view of the city from the top of it is also beautiful... One side you can see the sea, other side enjoy the city view... On the afternoon in the right time, you can also met the woman divers who will dive to look for abalone and other sea animals... Love this place, hope can visit again someday... v(^_^)v"
Must see in Jeju,Got to check this out if you're in Jeju. Great views. The hike is easy. Expect lots of people around and bring a jacket. Gets windy at the top.
Ready your tracking shoes,"We didnt expect to climb the peak when we arrive to Ilchulbong but it was worth it.. The view up there is just amazing!! Not really looks like the one that u will find in Google but yeah, it was amazing even for a close view.. They got stairs or seats up there so you can relax and take a nice breath after hiking the peak.. And even a little store before u reach the peak so that u can buy drinks if you are thirsty.."
must go for sunrise,"just climbing up in darkness is an experience by itself. wear good shoes, warm clothes, water and some munchies. take your time coming down and enjoy the scenic beauty."
Splendid View,"Be prepared to climb a long flight of steps to reach the top. Once you are at the top, the view is breathtaking. I love the view and the climbing is worth all the effort. There are a lot of restaurants and shops below and you can catch live performance of women divers are the bottom at certain time."
Loved the hike up! Nice view!,Great place to do some exercising to the top. Enjoyed watching the women divers perform at the bottom of the hill as well. Pretty cool place. Too bad we couldn't head there in the early morning to catch the sunrise; would have been breathtaking...
For the sunrise,the sun came up around 630am when I was there.. start hiking 430am got a good seat (rought 50minutes to reach the top).. it start getting crowded when is near 630am... the top is under contruction to extent the seatings. 
Breathtaking,"The climb to the top is tough, but totally worth it as the view from top is breathtaking. You will continue to enjoy the view from different angles as you descending through the clearly demarcated paths. A huge and beautiful patch of grass awaits you at the bottom of the hill as you recover from the climb (so don't waste too much time below before you even start climbing. There are a lot of drivers of tour bus that rest at the bottom of the hill and will even offer their assistance to take photographs for you. I totally enjoyed this place."
Lovely hike.,"I had a great afternoon there. Loved the hike up. However, I must say that I enjoyed the hike more than the view. The view was nice, but the peak looks more impressive from the photos taken from afar. I recommend it if you love nature and hiking. "
"Nice on the Helicopter photos, mediocre when you climb yourself","It's good to work out your legs, but if the view over the dull crater really is reward enough has everyone decide for himself."
Sunset Peak Also,"this beautiful mountain is located in the east side of island , from centre of jeju to mountain is around more than an hour . entrance ticket is 2 dollar and your journey will start from bottom of mountain , korean made easy stairs which really don't bother u that much . i visited mountain on evening so like sunrise which is famous , sunset can be too . this is a must so go n enjoy it ."
Great view,"A must go place if you are at jeju. Amazing view not only at sunrise, but also for sunset. 4 stars are given instead of 5 because it was too clouded. Otherwise it is prefect."
just enjoy the view,"We were there at around 10 am and there were already many tourists and tourist buses. At the entrance before we climbed to the peak, I found out why it was one of the most popular tourist spots in Jeju. The view was breathtaking. At some spots, we could see Udo. Despite the flocking of tourists (majority were foreigners including us) and the time of the day we reached there, the view was so stunning nevertheless. The flight of stairs was nothing compared to the view we witnessed."
Don't waste your time,"I could not recognise how horrible the place has become since my second visit in 2009. Not only was it very crowded, I was sad to see lots of garbage on the rocky beach below. It was also not possible to enjoy a nice walk by the cliffside for those of us not out to climb the mountain. I left after no more than 15 minutes to the utter surprise of my cab driver.It was a beautiful and serene place and the authorities should take steps to limit the number of visitors and do more to clean up the garbage."
Stunning Sunrise at the Peak,Caught sunrise at the peak after 40 minutes hike. I do not exercise regularly and the mini hike up the endless flights of steps was a little strenuous. Nonetheless the sight of the sunrise was rewarding and worth waking up in the wee hours of the morning and taking an 1 hr odd drive in the dark. I stayed behind a little after the sunrise with most of the crowd gone to enjoy the fresh air and the serenity of the peak while looking out to the horizon. It is one of the most memorable part of my trip to Jeju.
nice view,"A fantastic view of jeju and sea.... it takes about 40 to 45mins to climb up slowly... remember wear a pair of comfortable shoes to climb all the stairssss and bring a bottle of water as you can have rest a point to view some scenary and rest your feet and thirst before continue to climb to the top . You can get a very nice view at the top of the peak.. it quite cold windy as we went in October early morning around 7am seoul time, so do bring a jacket /wind breaker as well."
Choice of going up the peak or watching the woman dinner show (haenyeo) ,Didn't have much time so decided to watch the woman diver show first at the shores of seongsan ilchulbong (otherwise known as Sunrise peak). Shows are 130pm and 3pm. Quite interesting but they didn't seem to collect many sea creatures during the show. So the diving is mainly drive for tourists' sake. Can also buy fresh sea food from the women divers and get the restaurant right there to cook it. Walked up half way after that to grab some photo shots. 
Amazing sight,"We planned for a sunrise view at Ilchulbong Park, however, we couldn't manage to fight the sleep bug. We reached Ilchulbong Park around 9.30am. Stairs climbing is quite a difficult task for me as I do not exercise much. So, I do the climbing slowly, one step at a time and do not bother the people who surpassed me. We could enjoy different views of Jeju Island as we climbed. Me and my hubby were amazed by the view and scenery once we reached the top. All the sweats and pain were paid off when we see the amazing views of Jeju and Udo Island. We wished we were here for the sunrise."
"For the view, it's worth the hike up!","Even though it is only 180m in height, but to climb the stairs (no lifts or cable car) all the way up to the crater takes a strong determination and some stops in between. The view from the top is amazing. You can view the Seongsan town and its connecting roads which are surrounded by sea. It is very windy at the top, so make sure you have a scarf or a beanie with you. Wear comfortable shoes though I managed with sandals and no socks (applicable to early autumn)."
Nice hike,We didn't want to waste a cloudy day so we spent it hiking. Which was a nice little break from all the lazing around beaches we had done. Gorgeous views of Udo and Jeju. 
Uplifting experience ,The place is well kept and there was a lovely souvenir shop on site. There is not much to see in this part of Jeju so climbing up this rock was definitely an uplifting experience. 
Nice sight,"It can be a good spot for the sunrise, if the weather is good. Lots of great local fish restaurants nearby. "
Breathtaking view at the peak.,"It was a nice, warm yet windy weather when I was there. The climb was easy and safe, really a good exercise. Along the way up, there're small gazebos with benches for people to rest and catch their breath. Whoever climbs up are always drenched with sweat but when reached to the peak, the view was really breathtaking. It was worth the climb."
A beautiful start to any day!!!,"After a 1.5-hour drive in the wee hours of a beautiful night, we finally got to the ticket office at 5:50am.... we didn't expect to see this crowd (well, we thought we alone were the crazy ones).... we embarked on the trek saying... not bad!!! After 5 minutes, if was like... pooff!!!! After another 10 minutes, we were exhausted.. after yet another 5 minutes, it was a killer.... anyways, we made it to the peak at 6:18am and imagine our shock... there was a sea of people up there all set with their cameras...At precisely 6:28, it was there... flaming orange and rising at a speed unmatched (in sunrise). Spectacular!!! Fabulous!!!! Breath-taking!!! Start of a new day... a new way... new hopes... everything positive. It was so worth that strenuous climb.. If you are in Jeju, you gotta do this! Yes, the steps are high and tough, but so doable. We saw some people in ballerina shoes, with their fancy skirts and stockings.. keep the dressing for the yatch tours.. for this one, be ready for a mini hike."
Beautiful scenery,"A must go place when visiting Jeju-do. Although it was slightly drizzling on that day, there was still quite alot of local and tourists taking the hike. The climb was a smooth one with well laid pathway. Good exercise and a closer touch with nature.View was awesome and air was fresh, really heavenly and relaxing."
"great spot, so many tour groups","great spot, so many tour groups,30 minutes go up and down the peak. by bus line 701~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~"
Must visit place in Jeju!,"Just to pay 2000 won and tell yourself not to give up, you'll found it's definitely worth the climb up to the peak! You'll never regret when you see the awesome view and the refreshing air! For sure I will come back again in the future to see the morning sunrise!"
Better than expected,"Although it takes about an hour by bus from Seogwipo hiking up this volcanic peak was one of the highlights of our trip to Jeju. The hike only takes about an hour round trip, if you go at 1pm or 3 pm they have a women diver's show. Cost about 2,000 won each and there's many food vendors at the entrance of the park."
Beautiful,"Sunrise Peak is the nickname - I was sadly not able to see the sunrise because the weather, but it was still a beautiful lookout. The hike isn't too bad - I did have to catch my breath a few times because some parts are steep, but it was worth it. The path is lit, so you don't need a flashlight. Get there early because the good seats will be taken!The ferry to Udo Island is also close to here. You can find a path outside the town that leads to the ferry terminal. The path also provides great picture taking for Seongsan."
"if you go Jeju Island, you must visit this place","if you want to go to his place, you must go on the morning to see the sunrise. Seongsan is quite far from Seogwipo, so after you explore Seogwipo city, you can go to the Seongsan for stay. And then you must wake up at 5 am, and go to seongsan ilchubong by taxi. it needs 5-10minutes. Better you ask to the hotel to call the taxi. You need 20-30minutes to go to the top. The view is amazing. Very recommended. For the hotel in this area i recommended jeju lux hotel. you can read my review also."
A must visit!,"This is the highlight of our trip. For only KRW2,000, it's worth every won! A must visit. The hike to the top can be very tiring especially if you are not fit. That said, the air is fresh and invigorating, so take your time and pace yourself and you will reach there eventually. If ahjummas can make it up there, so can you! (what I was telling myself on my way up). When you finally reach the top, you get to see the crater, although I do prefer the view on the way up of the town and the surrounding areas. Even if you don't hike to the top, there is still much to see. If you take the scenic route, you can have a great view of the ocean and the cliffs. Great photo opportunities."
Throngs of people but so much to see,"This place was crazy crowded but it was a Sunday. Still, there was much to see. Unfortunately, the Haenyo weren't doing any demonstrations (I think the water was too rough or something). My wife and I hiked up to the 'peak' and got a nice view both of Jeju, Udo, and also the crater. Pretty cool! The hike was a bit strenuous and it was a little warm that day, so make sure to pack enough water. There were quite a lot of people around too so mind the crowd. Either way, it's worth the visit but probably best to go mid-week if possible. There are numerous great views to appreciate both on the way up and the way down. The path down takes a slightly different route too, which is nice."
Great volcano,"Really nice view when you get on top of the mountain, expect 40 minutes walk up and down. There will be a photo spots on your track."
Good views ,"This place is a must visit when you are in Jeju. That said, expect lots of tourists. Do try to be early, before 10 am, or at odd hours like lunch time, when most tourists are somewhere else. The climb up was not too tough, my 2 boys made the climb up quite easily. The stairs up might be a little tough for older folks. Views are excellent,worth the climb. Do bring enough water and some light snacks for rest and recharge at the top. During the climb up, there are benches to sit and rest. The restaurants in surrounding area at the foot, served mainly seafood. Prices are a little high, we had an abalone porridge and grilled mackeral for 45,000 won. There is a Lotteria and a Starbucks just before the ticket office. If you are on a budget or not into seafood, do bring some sandwiches or kimbap, you will be hungry after the climb. "
Nice 1-hr hike up,This peak offers a good view of the oreums and the sea but it did get very very crowded when we arrived there at about 9am. First time to Jeju? Must visit.
Must go in Jeju,"The hike up to the peak and return takes around 50 mins-1 hour. There are quite some stairs to climb so may take longer if you're travelling with elders. The view from the top is magnificent and the trail of stairs when you look down is also amazing. On your way down, you can watch the ""Sea Women Performance"" where they put on their diving suits and catch clams/seafood from the sea. The show is at 1pm and 3pm and will be cancelled due to rain/poor weather. Definitely #1 attraction in Jeju. In terms of admission fee, there's a booth at the entrance so we bought tickets. But we also see quite a lot of people who went in without paying, maybe its an honour system."
Don't let the climb put you off.,"We arrived shortly before sunset and made our way up the mountain. It didn't take too long at all, and there are plenty of resting areas for those who get tired quicker, or want to take in the views. Once at the top we didn't have to fight for space and we watched the beautiful sky change colours over the quaint little town below. It was gorgeous. A must see if you can."
"Great hike, marvellous view","The Seongsan Ilchulbong Peak has 2 main attractions. The first is obviously the climb to the peak itself. The second is the Woman Divers at the black sand beach at the bottom. We spent about 3 hours here and it was just barely enough. The climb is actually not that bad for the physically fit. The steps are steady and most are stone paved or have wooden stairs. There were quite a few elderly ladies/gents climbing too. Rest areas with benches are plentiful, so there really is no reason why you would not try for the top if you have the time. :-) Two thirds of the way up, you will see a big resting area with a marvelous view of the city below. Once you are up at the peak, you will also be able to see the city view AND into the crater. The climb back down is very safe with well made wooden staircases. Regarding the Woman Diver show at the bottom, I found the show to be a little underwhelming and a bit too touristy. However, it was still an interesting experience to see divers selling fresh seafood off the beach. If you have limited time, I would recommend that you focus on the hike/view, and just spend a couple of minutes to browse through the woman diver area. I think the Seongsan Iichulbong is a must-see in Jeju. "
Sunrise,"We reached there before 6pm to catch the sunrise. As the steps to the top were too daunting for us, we decided to watch the spectacle from the vantage point below the mountain. We did not have to jostle with any crowds as there were few tourists so early. I have never seen such a beautiful red sun rising up from the horizon. A scene not to be missed. "
The view is so nice!,"The view is so nice! It's a place where the sunrise and sunset look stunning. its a must visit place if you come to Jeju. I enjoyed the walk, fresh air and most of all the view. This is one of the world heritage in Jeju Island. Visited September 2014"
amazingly beautiful view!,"Walk up to the peak & you'll never regret...Healing by nature. Can see beautiful view of Jeju.Though a bit tiring to walk up to peak, you'll be amazingly surprised.Will come again soon!"
Aim for time before crowd,"I did this attraction around 3pm. Not only was the sun hitting me directly the whole time, but there was way too many people to do it in the suggested time. The suggested time is of about 50 minutes. It took me twice as much (sometimes I would stop to rest but mainly too many people to move any faster). I recommend doing this in the AM when the sun is hitting the other side of the stairs. Also I heard, from people in my hostal, if you do this in the morning you beat the crowd and you can have better pictures. I definitely think its something to do in the area. The views going up and once at the top are breath taking."
Not after lunch,"We went to Seongsan Ilchubong right after a heavy lunch and it was a mistake.being unfit that we are, we were unable to finish the climb. We didn't know that it was quite a steep climb. However, will return next November and will come better prepared :) hopefully can go all the way to the top. View is gorgeous even midway to the top. "
Top in Jeju,"Tip: if you are not coming for the sunrise like us, come early enough though, we arrived at 8 and it was pretty quiet but got crowded very fast when we left past 10 there were bus loads of Chinese tourists everywhere plus many Korean families. The way up is steep and you'll get a bit tired but the views from the top are fantastic, particularly over the sea since the shore is already getting seriously overdeveloped even in this part of the island which is comparably much less developed than others."
Of course you have to go here.,"Summary: You have to go here if you're on Jeju. But what can I add to the many reviews already here?The signs to the women's diving show are very clear. From the ticket office, just follow the signs down to the beach to the left of the peak. If the only way to make the show is to sacrifice something else on your itinerary, I wouldn't do it. But it was pretty cool if you happen to be there at the right time. You see the divers actually catch live octopus right in front of you.I recommend taking a snack up to the top and enjoying it there. There are plenty of places to sit down at the top and relax before you head back down. Also, definitely take at least one bottle of water if it's a hot day. You might even want two.If you plan to catch a taxi from this site to somewhere else, you'll have to walk just a little ways. We asked a taxi driver who was waiting on another family where we could get a taxi, and he told us where to walk. We had to wait about 10-15 minutes for one to show up that didn't already have people in it, but they always drive by eventually."
Tiring climb but great view,"Visited in on 31 Dec 2013 with my Cousin. There was a carnival going on and a stage was built for the new year count down that night. So there were lots of activities and music going on when we were there. It took us about 30mins to slowly climb up the stairs to reach the peak. The higher we go, the prettier the view was and we stopped along the way go take some selfies. By the time we reach the peak, we had taken off our sweaters and left with only our tshirt on although it's supposed to be winter. It was a good exercise but not advisable for those with knee problems. Would like to visit again in spring or autumn. "
Magnificent views of hills and sea below,"A tiring long walk but well-worth the workout as you get to soak in the beautiful green slops of the peak, and the ocean blue waters below. Lots of photo opportunities, and you also get to see the jet ski in the waters below."
One of World Wonderful Place,"It's a place where the sunrise and sunset look stunning. We should check the best time to catch the sunrise and sunset. It's a vulcano hill and become officially UNESCO world of wonder place, we can hike to the top (of course if you can)...The view is so nice! The wind is so strong here, please don't bring anything that easy to flyaway..."
A short climb but well rewarded on top,"I wanted to do this at sunrise but never woke up. So I went around 11h. Lots of tourists. It's all stairs to the top but not that hard. Takes 20 min in all. Beautiful view and scenery on top. There are some souvenirs and food shops at the bottom (Dunkin Donuts, Starbucks and cie).There is also a souvenir shop at half the moutain with beautiful engraved wood done by a woman there. I bought my most beautiful souvenir to her. She engraved Jeju, the date on it and wrapped it good for me. It's a short must do thing! You will get great pics there."
Its looks like a steep climb from the bottom - but its very much worth the effort,"From the bottom Seongsan Ilchulbong looks daunting, but once you get walking its relatively easy, with many well placed rest spots along the way. The views at each spot are pretty great - you can really appreciate the black sand beaches from there. Take some water with you!The top of the volcano is amazing - covered in a sea of green grass, it looks like it could easily be a set in a Jurassic Park movie. There is something so primal about the feeling up there. And despite the many other hikers you will find up there, its pretty easy to find a spot to sit and appreciate it for a bit!The entrance is 2000 won. Take some water, a camera and some coins for the scopes. Also, it gets really, really gusty up at the top and along the walkway to Ilchulbong beach, so try and avoid any flyway items of clothing. "
Great view,Do try to catch the sunrise. The view is awesome and the tour groups will start coming in around 9am onwards. Please check with your hotel staff the night before for sunrise timing. Do try to reach there at least 45mins before it rise. My friend and i overslept and had to literally run up in order not to miss the sunrise.
Experience Sunrise Peak From Every Perspective...,"Other than Hallasan...the massive shield volcano that created Jeju Island and now sits at its center, Sunrise Peak is perhaps the greatest of the nearly 400 craters, cinder cones or shield volcanoes (""oreums"" in Korean) found around the island. It's a bit of a hike to get to the top, seemingly straight up at times. But the incredible views from every angle will reward your diligence. depending on the season, you can see fields of yellow canola (or ""rape"") flowers; also Udo (Cow Island to the east, Hallasan to the north/northwest and the incredible Pacific all around...vast and hypnotic on a clear day. Nearby, you can check out the Aqua Planet Aquarium and the Women Divers Museum. Be sure to drive along the coast road and enjoy a coffee and dessert at one of the many unique cafes. Although there are now several franchise coffeeshops near Sunrise Peak, the independents offer a more relaxing atmosphere."
Breath taking view!,"Its worth it to climb up there. such a beautiful and breath taking view from the top. its a must visit place if you come to Jeju. entrance fee is just 2000krw per person. we actually drove there from our pension. many parking space. other than climbing the peak, you can also catch a Haenyo Diver Women performance at the bottom of mountain right beside it. its amazing to watch those elderly women holding their breath for several minutes without any oxygen mask! overall its awesome! for those muslims, there's fast food restaurant Lotteria for you to grab your lunch or dinner since they have shrimp burger available. its located on your left when exit the car park area."
refreshing and exhilarating views all around,"Been there during last autumn. This place is also known as Sunrise Peak. To reach the peak, you need to ascend 600 steps. The 1st 400 over steps seems easy but be more careful after that as the steps become steeper and more rugged. Also mind the autumn chilly strong wind which can blow your bags off (personal experience). Get there to the top for the panoramic view of the peak. Also, if you are in time, you can also watch the pearl diver women in action."
Breath taking view!,"Definitely worth the climb up to see the awesome view. I really liked that the route up and down were separate so you wouldnt have climbers coming on the opposite direction. We went in the afternoon after lunch which was rather hot, would definitely have preferred to go in the morning but our schedule didn't permit that. Still, definitely worth the climb. "
Great 130m walk up the mountain with a great view from the top,"Liked: The view, the walk.Disliked: Many tour buses spend time here which means the place was full of (literally) thousands of Chinese tourists. It was really hard to relax and enjoy the tranquility when you are in a constant scrum with many loud tourists yelling at each other in tonal dialects. "
You come to Jeju for this view,"Climbing up the iconic Seongsan Ilchulbong, by all means, is not an easy climbHowever, with the refreshing Jeju breeze, the beautiful landscape, and with a little thirst for excitement, it gets you going!The peak! though as you may predict how it would look like to be in the middle of the crater, the wind was so cool and refreshing and the view of Jeju, while going to the sides, makes the climb all worth it!Just too bad there wont be climbs at night to see glittering Jeju but seeing that it's no easy trek, I think it's understandableI am so thankful for the chance to see the sunrise and Jeju from the top!It was a breathtaking experience to see and not to mention, good exercise too!If you head over to Jeju, never miss this iconic place!To me, this is the overall representation of what Jeju has to offer!A promise of fun, beautiful and laidback adventure :)Another side of a Korean holiday experience"
A great visit!,"I enjoyed the walk, fresh air and most of all the view, it's crowded during the summer but otherwise a lovely place to visit."
Women diver performance,"Beautiful scenery. Can be quite difficult for some people not used to climbing. Don't really need to go up to the top. Even from below, view is great. There's a women divers' performance several times a day. Great chance to see them up and close. "
Mother Nature's beautiful creation,"Was amazed by the sight n vastness of this place even before we get to the top of it! There's stairways to lead you up to the top of it but it's quite a tiring climb for me :)However, the view at the top is worth the effort ., it is stunning !! You will marvel at the wonder Mother Nature has created !! Probably due to the timing we were there (about 11am), But wished there were lesser crowd so that one can embrace the view in quiet n peace."
Divers show!!,"Gorgeous view, didnt have to climb to the top! Try to catch the woman divers show at 130pm..some women divers are friendly too!"
Natural Stairmaster,The scenery is definitely beautiful and you feel achievement and reward once you make it to the top but the journey up is steep. If you are not in shape like me it can take a while but stopping along the way to look down and enjoy the view is nice. 
Hiking is a must!,"Prepare yourself for climbing up to the top of the hill. Stairway is excellent, you just need extra breath, but it is a must. Once you find yourself you are at the top, it is so relieving!!!"
Neat View,"If I would have been staying in the area, I would have given this five stars. However, I had to travel more than 90 minutes to get here, so it wasn't absolutely worth it to me. But, I really enjoyed the view. It's also nice that it doesn't take very long to climb to the top."
Fab sunset,Sunrise Peak. Sunset PeakWe travelled as part of a tour and on arriving were given the usual coach departure time. 1hour in this instance! Not sure of the entrance fee as it was included in our tourNot hanging around we set off immediately for the top with several good rests in between. The pathway is steep in places but in good order with plenty of resting/passing places. Separate paths up and down. Quite a climb but well worth it. Half way up is a little stall/shop for soft drinks and snacks (they have to manhandle everything up!)Once at the top there are plenty of viewing spots. Really worth the climb. We witnessed a superb sunset over the island and took some wonderful photosOn the path down there is a WC.We made the round journey just about in time with 15mins at the peak and a wander around the cliff edge on the way downFrom what I’ve heard the sunset is equally as breathtaking as the sunrise but not as crowded. Sunset was at approx 7.30 and on the way down the path is fairly well lit
Magnificent view,"This is one of the world heritage in Jeju Island. When i visit Jeju, i stayed in a hotel nearby, so i can see the sunrise from the top of seonsan Ilchulbong. To see the beautiful sunrise, i walk from my hotel at 4.30 am. You need to buy an entrance ticket to this place.You need to walk the stair path, uphill, and soon you arrive on top, you'll find so many people already setting up the camera to capture the sunrise. after enjoying the beautiful scene from top, on our way down, my eyes can't stop admiring the beauty scene of Jeju City. Everything is taking your breath away in this place.You also can ride a horse or watch the mermaid show (lady divers). If you want to buy some goods for your family from Jeju (orange, souvenirs, cake, snacks), you have to buy it in Jeju, because you can't find any of these goods in Seoul. If you want to give a second thought on it, your last chance to shop is in the Jeju International airport (price is the same everywhere in Jeju).This is a very highly recommended place to visit in Jeju Island!"
Not to miss this place,"Drive to the place is fantastic, walking up to the mountain takes upto 20 mts minimum. The panoramic view frm the top is mind boggling with blue tiled roof on one side of the mountain"
Simply amazing!,"This place was the first on my list of place-to-go in Jeju. We were quite rushing as we don't want to miss the Haenyeo show (I totally adore them since years ago while watching documentary!). We would love to go for hiking to the peak, but we are pretty much time-constrained. Make sure to wear comfy shoes as there are lots of stairs. Go downstairs (it's really tiring to go upstairs later) to the Haenyeo house for the show and be there early as those ahjumma (auntie) in diver suit will perform their Haenyeo song and dance before going to the sea (this is so much fun!). There is boat service provided if you'd like a tour. You may enjoy fresh raw seafood (abalones, octopus etc.) from their catch, approx. from KRW10000 for a plate. If you love horse-riding, give it a try!The area is surrounded with souvenir shops. Try Hallabong (citrus fruit), one of Jeju specialities! The sight is way too gorgeous to be missed. MUST-GO-PLACE!Haenyeo (women diver) show: 1.30 pm & 3.00 pmAdmission fee for adult: KRW2000Boat ride: KRW10000Horse-riding: approx. KRW5000++Hallabong: KRW2000 each"
Definitely worth the effort & plan for more time,"Time was not at our disposal, else, we would love to spent 2-3 hrs at this UNESCO site, enjoying the hike, the view, the shore, fresh seafood and the women divers show, especially when the weather is good in Spring!The hike is well built with rest points every now and then. It's said to take 25min up, 10min view, 15min down (total 50min). We believe that was timed with FIT people who DON'T stop on the way. Though the trail is not difficult to complete, the guided time is challenging for folks who don't exercise regularly, and in most cases, tourists will be tempted to stop and absorb the beautiful scenery too! 6 of us (middle age) separately took about 40-45 min to reach the top, catching breathers like many others and stop many times for good photos in-between. Once you are at the peak, plan for more time to rest, take in the fresh air and enjoy the 360deg view, nice to bring some drinks up here too. It's a shame most people just quickly take photos and move on. The way down is another route, no need to crash with the climbers, and yes, it took 15min WITHOUT stopping. Again, if you are tired, there are simple resting points on the way down. This is not the end of the visit. Do remember to walk down to the shore for the women divers show (1.30pm & 3.30pm). If it is not the right schedule, at least enjoy the beach or a seafood snack. One fresh abalone cost 10,000won. The gradual stroll down/up to/from the shore is easier and will take 30 min the most (without the snack break). The scenery is beautiful from the shore too. Photographers will be happy shooting away in the entire area."
A Must at Jeju!,"We thought we're going to be at the base only because we brought along our 3 years old son.To our surprise, our son can complete the route going up and down by himself (he refused for me to carry him). The steps were quite easy and it's really worth it.If you miss this, your visit to Jeju-do is incomplete."
breathtaking view~,"Traveler should wear a suitable clothes & shoes for hiking here. Bring also the drinking water. When you reach at the peak of this mountain, take a seat & enjoy the view from the top. "
Very beautiful sunset,"Went during winter. The view at Seongsan Ilchulbong is amazing. The steps are very tiring, but it's definitely worth it! Very beautiful sunset from up there looking down. Next time when I go Jeju again, I'll still make a visit to enjoy the relax and beautiful scenery."
"Lovely hike, value depends on weather!","I have visited Sunrise Peak (Seongsan Ilchulbong) for sunrise hikes on three occasions this year. Each was very different, but all pleasant. Things to consider:- The hike is all steps, but only takes about 20 minutes for a moderately fit person.- The top is always windy. If it's already windy at the base, make sure everything you carry is tied/contained, because it can be very windy at the top.- It costs a small fee to enter when the ticket booth is open. If you get there really early, they might not be open yet!- No bathrooms after you leave the parking lot (and no secluded places), so plan accordingly!- Nothing at the base will be open before a sunrise hike, but you should be able to grab coffee/donuts after!- It's nice to carry up a picnic breakfast and sit at the top to eat and watch the other tourists.- Check the weather before you go if you really want a good view. We had a couple cloudy days that were less spectacular, but still always a refreshing hike, beautiful mountain and cool views over the ocean.We usually pair our trip with a trip out to Udo Island or to some of the other east-coast attractions like Manjangul Caves.There's a lovely motel paired with a seafood restaurant about 10 minutes walk from the entrance to the peak hike. Follow the beach sidewalk almost to the edge of town. Views from the in-room balconies over the beach. Big rooms and nice folks, even if they don't speak any English."
Breathtaking scenery,"I love this place so much. Everyone can easily climb this mountain because they provide stairs which is well built, not too steep and not slippery. Although it made me tired to climb to the top but the scenery up there is very beautiful. I took so many photographs. The combination of land and sea scenery is very good.There is also many souvenir shops and food stall on the rest area with cheap souvenirs which is a good place to buy jeju souvenirs.Must visit."
Beautiful At The Peak,"I've visited Seongsan Ilchulbong 11 years ago and this is my 2nd visit. Why? Because this place is so beautiful. The climb is really worth it. I took about 30 minutes to reach the peak. View of the peak and below are lovely. As the path to the peak involve stairs, be careful as it can get pushy (there are just so many tourist there). Entrance fee is 2,000 won per adult. Parking area is large but you will find yourself searching for an empty lot if you come late."
Beautiful Jeju,"Totally worth the climb! I consider myself to be a couch potato, so that claim was quite tough for me. It took me around 40 minutes, with short breaks in between. But once you get to the top, soak in the crisp fresh air, indulge in the magnificent view, you'll be wanting to do it all over again. Definitely recommend seongsang il chul bong if you are going to Jeju-do. "
Wow!,"We were lucky to catch the sunset while we were there. Amazing view! At this place, you can also watch the women divers show, and also ride a horse. So there are a number of other tourist attraction at the same place. "
Worth the climb,"This site consists of a large network of staircases that you climb to see a crater as well as a beach where the woman divers do a demonstration.The walk up the stairs is very long. It is not impossible and there are many places to take breaks without holding up the line. The spot is very busy so there will be an unbroken line of people going up and down. I would suggest taking water with you. The view from the top is quite nice. Allow 1 hour to do the climb at a leisurely pace.At the beach the woman divers do demonstrations on a set schedule. Check the times when you arrive. They will suit up for the dive, sing a song and then go into the water looking for seafood. When we were there a lady came back with an octopus. It does not take long for them to find something so it is worth it to wait to see the catch.There are bathrooms and snack shops there as well."
Best of JEJU,"This is it, even though its FULL of stairs and exhausting to climb up (with lots of ""take 5"" in between the climb. The view is magnificent and too beautiful to behold.Consider this the best part of JEJU."
i miss here...,"this form part of our family trip (winter korea trip end November - December 2013), which the view so so nice, so do the weather...1 thing must try, which we missed.. go to the bottom near to the side which there are so may fresh seafood available which the foods are so to fresh, straight from the sea!"
Exhausting climb but worth the view :),"We had an hour and 30mins here, part of a tour we took,we were really too exhausted to reach the very top but there is a viewing deck somewhere up there and the views were magnificent. The view of the sunrise peak was also beautiful from the bottom. REally worth the visit!!"
Easy hike well worthwhile!,"I went with my elderly parents. It was nice to share the hiking experience with them. The hiking trail is very well planned and maintained, with railings, paved paths and anti-slip strips on the stairs. This makes it very accessible for a wide age groups. For a 50 minute hike (we took 90 minutes) with lots of rest breaks and photo taking breaks in between, you get to experience the scenic views of a mountain hike."
Worth the Climb!,"The place was filled with cars, buses and people at about 10.30am when we were there but we had no difficulty finding a parking lot. We were too lazy to wake up early to watch the sunrise which should be spectacular. Signs were well posted as to the route to climb up. It was a tiring climb but we were rewarded with spectacular view of the surrounding. After getting down from the peak, we headed towards the shore where Haenyo woman divers sell their catch of the day. To get there, it was another flight of stairs up and down but again it was an experience to be near the shore and watching people eating raw stuff."
Tiring climb but worth it for the spectacular view,"It was a tiring climb to the peak. Good thing there are stairs to lead you to the top. The place can be crowded at time, but glad that there is only one way up and the other way down to guide the human traffic flow. At the peak, you are rewarded with the spectacular paranorma view of the towns nearby and of course the bowl-like crater. Worth to challenge yourself to the climb."
"Must visit, especially on sunny day","Spectacular views from the bottom, the side, the peak and everywhere else. I couldn't put down my camera. After two rainy, cloudy days at Jeju, the morning of our visit to Sunrise Peak we were blessed with blue skies.The ticket booth (2000 won for adults, 1000 for youth) listed the roundtrip time as 50 minutes, but we spent 2+ hours climbing and descending the tuff cone, followed by checking out the 1:30 p.m. Haenyo woman diver performance. (There is a second performance at 3:00 p.m.)The tuff cone at the peak is something else, and the climb itself is not that bad, especially if you take it slow. The descent is arguably just as good, with cooling breezes and more picture opportunities. One Con: It can get fairly crowded. Dozens of tour buses are parked at the base, carrying mainly Chinese tourists. It get can a bit competitive at times waiting out the best picture spots, but luckily they like taking pictures by signs. Overall it's not that bad, though it was funny watching the korean couples' responses to the crowds, with the girl posing for the picture and giving the side eye while the guy patiently crouched several feet away.But hey, it's a UNESCO heritage site and definitely worth a trip!"
Beautiful view,"Worth the climb, the view was fantastic from the peak. But a little bit crowded lots of Chinese tourists. There are nearby restaurants and starbucks too."
Splendid View,"Definitely worth visiting. Although with 50 mins of climb, you will feel all well worth it after reach the peak. The view was just simply amazing. The best spot for photo taking beautiful natural, landscape and with friends. When I was there, was so crowed with people. This place is so popular. A must go. UNESCO sight."
"Great workout, but crowded",Definitely worth visiting for the great views; fairly manageable climb up using well-maintained wooden staircase. But can be quite crowded.
One of my favorite spots of Jeju,"I enjoyed the hike although it was very steep. They now have an ascending and descending trail to help avoid getting overcrowding trail, which can happen with the common bus loads of Chinese tour groups or student groups. The hillside is beautiful and the trail has amazing views. When you get to the top, it seems a little underwhelming but the hike itself gets 5 stars even in April when a lot of vegetation is dry. The hike takes about 30 minutes to get to the top. It cost 2,000 won a person to enter. I also saw that you could ride horses at the base of the mountain."
Naturally amazing!,"So everyone says it would take you an average of 50 mins to do one round. I travelled with 2 elderly folks and it took us almost 120 mins so they wouldn't feel so physically stressed. In a way, walking with them was a great blessing - the multiple stops gave me many opportunities to go trigger happy on my camera and to enjoy the breeze. Do note that even though it gets hot during the climb, it is advisable to bring a windbreaker at least. Leave your bags in the vehicles if possible and go appropriately dressed. The climb is easy - mostly gentle gradients and low and even steps - and there is even a rest point midway for you to purchase mineral water at 1000KRW. It was not crazily exorbitant. There is a toilet midpoint along the ascending trail and one towards the end of the descending trail. If you are planning to see the women divers, check with your guide so you hit at just the right time. They were diving at 1.30pm and 3pm that day and we managed to catch the earlier slot. "
Scenic view,"On the way to the site, we took pictures from afar by the beach.We hiked a bit but mostly sat down and admired the scenic view spread at the foot of Seongsan. Haenyo divers may be found in their area below where they made a performance for the audience. It was cloudy and vey cold but do bring sunblock!"
"Hard climb at 5.45am, panting and cloudy but finally it emerged from the clouds","The ticket office was still not opened, cold and windy and we could not find the signs. We just follow 2 guys, there were more people coming along but not in tourist buses. So going this early is best to avoid the hordes of tourists we saw after we had our sunrise view and breakfast. It is steps all the way but it goes up and up and up and up ... bring your gloves windproof type!The crater is in front of you and then the sea and in the horizon, the egg yolk getting cook and rising up into the sky. Cloudy and initially disappointed but we waited and finally it emerged from behind the clouds and the rays and appearance became much more dramatic!One of the best sunrise I have experienced!"
Nice view,"Went via a taxi tour in Early Feb 2014. Admission for each person: 2000 won.Hordes and hordes of tourists but you can still try to take some nice and pretty pictures while waiting for those tour groups passing by. Divers performance (if I am not wrong) is at 11am and 3pm. We did not went during that time so we did not manage to see it.Without going up to the peak, you can also see a nice view of the ocean and surroundings. There are also several souvenirs and food shops at the foot of the sunrise peak. It is a UNESCO site and it is a must to visit if you are in Jeju! Still awesome despite in winter.Don't forget that there are stairs and stairs up to the peak :P"
