What you see in movies ,"This was a very good experience, It is WAY bigger than I expected. The market branches off many times from the main strip."
Enjoy seafood meal and also walk between the dried and wet market,"Pohang a MUST visit place would be the Jukdo Market,it is the biggest market I have been visit in Korea. The dried market selling all sorts of dried seafood and seaweed, as well as fruits and etc. The wet market is obviously all the famous fishes and snow crabs where you can ordered on spot and have a meal inside their restaurant. Snow crab - They normally sell based on min 2person which cost between KRW 60000-KRW120000 per kg. Depends on which stall you visit, and that exclude that you need to pay for table seating fees at around KRW4000 per person that comes with all the bancan exclude rice. If you are a seafood lover you must definitely not give it a missed to taste it. The crab meat is taste sweet and they actually just cooked with seawater so you can actually taste the freshness. For non seafood lovers, you can also walk outside the seafood market and you will see some BBQ restaurants and pub selling both Korean and western food there."
Great to look around and get cheap seafood!,"If you're new to the city or visiting, it's the best place to go for all things seafood;decent bag of mussels for 5,000won when in season, king crab, raw fish and many other squiggly sea creatures! There's also side dishes, a noodle corner and a lot of fresh produce available - much fresher and cheaper than supermarkets. Also make sure to check out the non-food section. Get yourself some daily hanbok, fabric, hardware etc."
Excellent expeirnece,"Was in Pohang for work. Jukdo Market and Bukbu Beach are not far from each other. Plenty to do in the area. The people are friendly, prices are reasonable, it is a most enjoyable place to visit! Would recommend to anyone traveling around South Korea."
it's a good place to visit.,It is the largest fish market in Pohang. Food's price is reasonable and Merchants are kind. so it's a good place to visit.
Active peoples and many live fishes,For fresh fishs it is the best place to tast. Especially you can buy and eat a dish of sashimi with less than 30 dollar.
The maze.,"The market is a fascinating place. There is a great variety of stuff to be found, and the different sea creatures displayed is very interesting. If you wish to eat seafood, you can pick your creature and then eat it in the restaurant right behind or next to the vendor. If you are the re e at the right time you can see them bring it in from the boat.The place is huge."
"Many variety of products, clean enough","There are so many types of products, e.g. clothes, house utensils, flowers, simple snacks. It is a good place to find many cheap things too, I guess."
Who needs a sea life aquarium when you have Jukdo Market,"Definitely worth a visit if you'd like an R-rated version of Finding Nemo. Asian markets are always a ""treat"" for all your senses. Still wondering why the enormous octopuses couldn't be bothered with escaping/leaping from their small water tanks. Definitely try the crab in one of the many restaurants behind the counters (extremely fresh, tasty and cheap)."
Authentic Korean Experience,"you can eat at restaurants behind the crab market, they will cook the crabs you pick out. You eat sitting on the floor. I was with someone who could speak Korean, so you may need google translate to help, but it was an awesome authentic Korean experience"
An interesting place to see and shop,"Very interesting and colorful yet a bit on the traditional side market that spreads in a several city block area near downtown. You can find anything from knock-offs to low name brands, freshly locally grown produce, household goods, and best of all freshly caught seafood that are still in tanks and giant bowls of water. It's almost like a miniature marine aqua zoo. You can find any local fish from sharks, rays, eels, etc. Also fresh local squid in big aquariums. Even if you buy nothing it's worth a visit if you are in the area. I doesn't stay open late in the evening as it is more of a day market."
A Cacophony of Colour! ,A remarkable place filled to the brim with exotics. There are a huge variety of things on sale - from vegetable seeds to wonder fresh produce. An amazing array of seafood - both fresh and processed. Clothes of all variety many many more things. Well worth a visit. 
Seafood Time,"Since Pohang located nearby the sea, so seafood here are really fresh. I went to eat seafood two times there. First one with my Korean friends and the second one with my Indonesian friends.The first time I visit Jukdo market, we ate kind of sashimi. I forgot the specific name since they spell it in Korean language but it all taste really good and really fresh. I don't have much experience eating uncooked fish but surprisingly I don't have any problem with that. The seller also friendly, they serve the food really fast. Even I could see the process.The second time I went there we bought nakji, which is uncooked octopus. It was challenging to chew moving octopus tentacle. But if you're not sure to try, please don't try it."
Ricardo,"Interpreting and multicolor view.Is a place where you find many local foods,clothes and others.There is an open place area and indoor also.Interesting for spend some time of your day."
Friendly visit ,"This place is pretty cool... sensory overload! From the smells, sights, sounds, food. Wish I had more time to walk through all aisles. If your looking for fresh seafood, veggies, or spices, this is the place."
Amazing market,"This spot has anything food wise. The fresh seafood is out of this world. Live snow crab, octopus, any fish you can imagine and some you can't. Pork, chicken, ducks, beef. Farm fresh vegetables. So much to see. I got hiking pants and shirt for 20,000 won. American sizes run true. You need bed sheets and blankets? Can find that too. Great day trip out. "
Great if I was a seafood enthusiast,"It's a huge market with many hall ways! You can get a little lost. Of course the big sellers here sell all sorts of fish, some I didn't know existed or were edible. The smell did become too much for me at times though.You can buy seasonal fruits, eastern medical remedies, furniture, bedding, flowers, ect... Basically anything. AND no one shouts or harasses you to but there wears! "
Interesting fish market,"It's a full quater of fish shops ,hundreds and hundres most of them show the fish still alive , others died.Really peculiar , a mix between an aquarium and the kitchen of a fish specialized retaurant.I was there in an evening , they were closing the shops and refilling the tanks, it was a nice walk."
If it is found in the sea you’ll find it here,I didn’t buy anything there but I still loved to look at everything. I swear you’ll see things you never saw before and won’t have any idea what they are or how one eats it.
"Best, Freshesh & Cheapest Place for Snow Crabs","Visited Pohang Jukdo Market in the hopes of eating snow crabs. Walk abit in Jukdo Market before coming to towards an end intersection whereby there's lots of restaurant selling snow crabs and other seafoods. Not sure which to go for snow crabs as a few of them seems to pulling and doing hard selling to their crabs. So, decided to walk abit and peek into restaurant to see how many locals are eating in that restaurant. Finally there's one that have a hand full koreans. Woah.... the snow crab is really nice and cheap only, $10,000 won 1 each... its so fresh and nice that i ordered a second one to enjoy it. So, If you love snow crabs like me... do make a trip down to Pohang. Its the only place in South Korea that sell so cheap of snow crabs, no any other places."
They animated me!,I felt I was in the noir film as I walked through thick steam spewing from the pots of boiling octopuses in the early morning. There were stalls with fresh fishes and vociferation around them at the end of Jukdo fish market. Live fishes and squids were squirming in the plastic containers and workwomen were busy cutting them alive. Strong briny smell was on the air. You can also taste stinky whale meats there.The active life there encouraged me to get over the dullness of mine.
Dog soup anyone,First time I saw dog legs and smelt wet dog. It was shocking and very cultural. It was not cleaned up and Westernized in 1999. It is probably the same. Best time to visit is rainy season and have a nice soup.
Gigantic colourful market,"Jukdo market is huge and like nothing you will see in the West. There are whole sections of narrow streets and alleys dedicated to fish, meat, vegetables, clothes, hardware and lots more. Some of the restaurants within the market are good places to try seafood, including the local speciality, mulhwae, which includes raw fish and is very tasty. You will probably need to sit on the floor in the traditional way. Even if you don't need to buy anything, it's well worth a visit to enjoy the spectacle of the market and appreciate its sheer size and the variety of goods on offer. The fish and seafood are very impressive."
Sunday morning visit,If you like markets then this is well worth a visit if at any time you in the areaIts so big you can take half a day just in the fish market part there are such a range of vegetables that is before starting on the clothes section
Dynamic life we can see,I visited my wife. We can see many of fish and see food?. Anyway there is very dynamic and interesting place i think.
the market was crowded,"We came in early morning and the market was crowded. Traders cannot speak English so we had to ask for help from the tour guide. The weather here is cold and the goods are mostly dried fish and stuffs, there are some othe vegetables. We bought some grilled dried fish to eat right there and that was very good with some Korean cooked beans and sauce."
Interesting but where were the patrons?,I visited mid-afternoon: this interesting market was rather quiet.The dried fish (row after row) is something I don't see in Australia.Perhaps it is busy in the morning. Its buildings are historic. Worth a look.
