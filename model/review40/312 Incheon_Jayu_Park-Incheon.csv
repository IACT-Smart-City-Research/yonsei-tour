Nice for a stroll,I walked up the steps from China Town through the old Japanese Concession.Jayu Park is nicely laid out.The paths lead upwards to the Statue of General MacArthur and the observation area overlooking the port.There is an ice cream kiosk to help you cool down!
Awesome ,Awesome place beautiful stunning place. Nice place to visit.Nice to stroll through lovely large park
Worth a visit,"In the park itself you will see a statue of General Douglas MacArthur. When we visited on a Thursday afternoon in winter, the place was fairly empty but there were visitors every now and then. However, the trees were beautiful as the leaves changed colours during winter. This place is worth a visit if you are in the Chinatown area in incheon. Itâ€™s about a 10-15 minute stroll from Chinatown on a uphill climb."
Nothing much too see,"Nothing much inside, good for strolling after meals and taking photos. Can see the locals walking their dogs and elderly playing chess with their friends in the park. "
"Jayu Park, also known as McArthur Park","Beautiful large park honoring General McArthur. Walked from the train station, through Chinatown, to reach this park. There are steep stairs on one side, but accessible with fewer steps on another side of the park."
"up the hill, wear sneakers","jayu means freadom, i would not surprise it was named jayu because the park seems a landmark about korean history, there was a monument up there, and on the way down from the park, there was a mural about korean history. it was a quiet place, and beautiful scenery."
for a short break a good park,"I like the place, actually the park is a historically significant than the views and facilities it offers. However you can reach here easily from China town. Good for a after lunch walk. You can see the Incheon port view. Summer days can be very hot but there are lots of benches and shades available for the rest. "
Beautiful park!,"The flowers, history and many walkways make this a park to definitely be on your list of things to do. Easy to get to."
Great place to walk around!,"Great place to visit while in Incheon! The park was bigger than i thought and contained beautiful architecture as well as information on why they are important. Highly recommend visiting if you need to get away from Seoul for a bit and enjoy a more ""country"" side."
Good quiet park on the hill,"This is a pretty nice park on the hill.It has a great view with just a few people.There are a decent pavilion lookout, the statue of Douglas MacArthur and the structure to memorize ROK-US relationship.By the way, locating on the hill, I think old people with 70+ years old will have some difficulties to climb up."
Pretty Cool Park,"Came here while briefly in Korea. It is a great place to stop by while in the area, but I probably wouldn't take a trip here only for this. Check out some of the surrounding attractions as well. "
Quiet and Relaxing Park,"We took a taxi to this park on a rainy day. We had just visited the Incheon War Memorial and were particularly interested in viewing the statue of Geeral MacArthur. We were glad to have taken the decision to travel by taxi, as the entrance to the park is up a steep slope, and we had heavy backpacks, so wished to avoid the difficult trek. Other options to reach the park, are by train to Incheon Station or by bus. Both options require an uphill walk to the park.The park is beautifully maintained with many trees and flowers, and quite a few sitting areas. There is a small shop nearby where refreshments may be purchased. The statue of General MacArthur provides a good photo op, and there is a small sailor monument to the right of the entrance to the MacArthur Statue, which is a replica of the life sized Lone Sailor monument in San Fransisco at Vista Point. A few minutes walk away on a grey tiled path opposite the MacArthur Statue is the Korean American Centennial monument. This monument represents 100 years of trade between America and Korea. It's centerpiece is two links of a chain, and this is surrounded by five triangular shaped columns pointing to the sky.We had visited Ganghwa Island in Incheon the previous year, which was the site of the 1871 war between Korea and America. it should be noted that the Koreans refused to sign the trade treaty with the Americans until 11 years later in 1882, This monument celebrates 100 years of trade and friendship since the signing of the trade and peace agreement in 1882.There are a few other monuments and decorative structures in the park which may be seen during a walk through. I would recommend strolling downhill after visiting the Park, as the path leads to the Confucious Statue which is the upper entry of China Town. The subway and bus station are a short walk from China Town."
Freedom Park in Incheon Chinatown: A Beautiful and Memorable Park with General McArthur Statue,"Freedom Park adjacent to Incheon Chinatown is an added powerful attraction to this area. The park was especially beautiful with flowers and trees during my visit in late April. In addition to the beautiful landscape and the view of Incheon harbor, the park also has Statue of General McArthur with a metal plate depicting the Incheon Landing which dramatically turned the tide of the battles around during Korean War. The park also has The Korea - U.S.A. Centennial Monument.The harbor and the sea beyond are now peaceful. But you can imagine the dramatic scenes of landing ships and troops wading through the water facing fierce fire power of North Korean defenders!!You can visit this beautiful and memorable park by 1-hour metro ride (Line # 1) from Seoul at nominal metro fare.You can combine this park visit with walking tour of colorful and exotic Incheon Chinatown and delicious Chinese foods at reasonable prices. I would highly recommend visiting Freedom Park along with Incheon Chinatown.[Details on how to get to Incheon Chinatown are shown in my separate posting at TripAdvisor site]"
Lovely place in spring,"I visited on 27th of April and trees were in fool blossom, so it was very pretty, pink color everywhere :)Lots of nice places to sit, nice pathways to walk and mural village is just around the corner."
Nice little park with beautiful spring blossoms,"About an hour away from central Seoul (via subway), this park is ideal for people like me who prefer less crowded places to explore. I have not seen too many overseas foreigners here, mostly local tourists. "
Lovely Stroll,Freedom Park is great for a stroll and well worth doing but there is not enough information depicting why the park was established and any history associated with it. Other than that it's quiet a beautiful spot. 
BEAUTIFUL Park ,This park is soo peaceful and the sculptures are wonderful. The people so friendly the gardens and flower displays are beautiful 
Beautiful Park,Thus us peaceful with lovely gardens Gym area. Lots of historical statues and such lovely friendly people. Steep to climb up all the steps but we'll worth it. China town is amazing with all the lovely shops. 
Incheon Family trip ,"We specifically chose to see the place though a bit far from our hotel near city hall of Incheon. Nonetheless, we were very happy to have seen the unset from the top of this hilly park! Lots of memories from the past where you'll find statue of Gen MacArthur and some post war memorial. Footpaths are well placed that leads to some interesting points where pavilions and seat walls and benches are carefully placed. We went there during the winter and it was very cold indeed but we enjoyed taking photos and selfies together. I'm trying to imagine how beautiful the place would have been if it was autumn where most trees would turn into gold color. It's a good place to hike or jog with its uphill and downhill paths while enjoying the beauty of nature! It was almost dark when we left and had a good memories of this lovely place! The park is near Chinatown and reachable by subway train from Incheon subway station. "
Best park,"Jayu park is located somehow within Liberty park, but it's truly the best part with tons of flowers (on season) and offering a wonderful view over the city and the sea!"
Nice park in Incheon,Super enjoyable park near chinatown. My favorite part is the small plaza with the rose garden! A small canal of water is located on a good part of this place.Just stroll around and relax!
Park on the Hill near Chinatown (Incheon City),Nice and beautiful park near Chinatown Area. You can see the top view of the Incheon harbor and some parts of Wolmido. 
The breathtaking park,"It's located in East Incheon near the China Town. There are many paths for talking a walk or jogging and the Korean - USA centennial Monument, the status of MacArthur. You can see the ocean view, wolmido island & partial of city view from the statue of MacArthur Square. It's a great park that you need to visit in incheon!"
April the best time to view the cherry blossoms bloom,"April the best time to view the cherry blossoms bloom.About 3 hours walk and Incheon Old Town TourAdjacent to Chinatown, fairytale village songwoldong."
Another park with War memorial,"In the end its another park with a war memorial, was a nice trip there and a nice view over the harbour."
Nice view,"Need to climb lots of stairs, but view is worth it. If you are in china town or subway station it is good to visit. But I don't come here especially for this park. "
War memorial,If you are nearby it is worth to visit but I wold not make a journey here to extra to see it. Can also be watched during night.
Best view in the city,The walk up the hill to get to the top may be a little rough if you are out of shape but totally worth it. The walk down is a lot easier :-)
Worth the hike,Interesting place. Am glad I took the time to hike up the hill. Learned a little more about the Korean war. Got some nice photos. Am sure it is beautiful during spring time
This is option of Chinatown,"Incheon's Chinatown is one of the two spots. After you've seen the Chinatown, if you had the free time, go this place.but there is few seeing.  If you are interested in the Korean War.That's O.I that you go this place.You can see the MacArthur statue."
Enoyable prak,Nice park to take a stroll through and get an overview of Incheon's port. The area around MacArthur statue is nicely decorated with flower beds and the war memorial is worth a visit. Most people recommend visiting the park after China Town. I would rather say visit the park and just see Chinatown on the way towards the park
"the park where nature, history, and traditional culture are harmonized","this park is the first western-style modern park in Korea that was developed in 1888. at the conclusion of the Korean War, a statue of General MacArthur was erected there to commemorate the Incheon Landing Operation he led. the park was also renamed 'Jayu Park' at this time. Jayu Park bears a rich testimony to some of the most turbulent decades in the modern history of Korea. currently, various events like competitions and performances are held here. thus, it also serves as a recreation area for residents and tourists."
great place to visit,While on work travel spent the afternoon at the park. Lovely park with plenty to see . Very educational.
Wonderful historic park,"If you're a history buff, loves flowers, or just loves to relax in a park, this is a good place to go to. It has a Gen. MacArthur monument and overlooks the bay. Spring would be the best time to visit since the flowers and trees are in full bloom."
Cultural hill,"If you visit Chinatown, you should visit this place, it is close to it. It is a part that remember the help of freedom between US+Korea, and also is a good walk, and the elderly people join to play 'Baduk'"
"A Pleasant, Informative Surprise","We had a long layover in Incheon Airport; the most accommodating airport apparently in the world! One of the free tours the airport offers is an excursion to Jayu (Freedom) Park. Here is a tribute of appreciation to General McArthur's leadership in freeing South Korea from the North's invasion. Well worth the trip! Once the tour bus returns to the airport, besides entertainment & a parade of the ""royal family"" in traditional clothing, there's even an opportunity to dress in some traditional Korean clothes."
Great View of Incheon's Port & City,"You have a nice view from the top of the hill of Incheon City, port and surrounding areas. It is peaceful and not crowded, not advisable for thrill-seekers."
The view of Incheon Port,You can see the view of Incheon Port from here. There is also General McArthur's statue from Incheon landing history from WWII. This is a nice place to stroll.
Commemoration of Korean War,"This park is located right next to the Chinatown, Incheon. U.S. General MacArthur's statue is among the highlights of the park. The Freedom Park overlook down on the shores of Yellow Sea ( or West Sea known to locals) where General MacArthur led the U.N. forces to landed on the shores of Incheon during the Korean war in 1950's. There are many restaurants nearby and other public attractions, I was told when the weather gets warmer, there's a cultural events and folk art dances and parades are common around the park. There are many transportation options from Seoul to Freedom Park, such as subway and buses, which is the cheaper ways to get there or you can take taxi at much higher fee. "
Pleasurable walk,"Jayu means freedom and this hillside park is a great place for a morning walk. It is indeed pleasurable to walk with the wind blowing, admiring the birds, flowers and trees. There are many large and small sculptures to look out for. The notable large sculpture is the statue of General MacArthur who was honored for leading the US army in the Korean War. The other large monument is for the centenary of Korea-USA relations. The park offers spectacular views of downtown Incheon and its surrounding mountains, the port and the sea."
This is a Place you Should see,"This park has a great view of Incheon harbor, and is nestled right above Chinatown. The monuments to General MacArthur and to the centenary of Korean-American relations make it a particularly touching place for American Visitors. Go at sunset as the best view is to the West. Then walk down the hill to the brown and white colored restaurant for some delicious Chinese-Korean food."
Good place for walking and relaxing,"If you are especially coming here only for seeing the park maybe i dont think i will recommend this place its located in the higest spot in the chinatown area,and from here you can see incheon port too, There are also General MacArthur statue and Korean War statue with the historical background written in korean."
It's Okay,"Depending on where you enter the park, it's more like a hiking trail than a park. If you love walking up mountainous terrain, then this site is for you. I feel like I walked about three miles to see something that was really sub-par."
A good spot for a view over Incheon,"The park is located on a hill in the vicinity of China Town. It's a bit of a walk with steep roads but well worth it if you like a view over the city and port. There is also some memorials of the landing of General McArthur and the treaty between former Korea and U.S in late 19th century. Otherwise it is a quick visit. It's easy to find as well, just follow the brown signs located everywhere. If you bring small kids, be sure to stop by the fairy tail ""village"" too."
Good park,"As a native korean I beleive this park is enjoyable not only for myself, but also for the self of many other including foreigners who will come here. I think there are many areas you can relax and enjoy and you can also take your girlfriend/boyfriend here. This park has remember to the general in war, mcarthur. The garden surrounding is very beautiful. I think also you can better enjoy the park after you visit the china town, there are very many of the elderly people who will come here, if you can speak korean you can chat with them they can tell you a lot. I have found myself talking to them on several occasions, the elderly have many life experience, you always should remember and respect them. This is my thoughts, and on the park, some people will say its not worth visiting but I say you should, if you want to see history and beautiful scenery."
Worth visiting if you're in the area,"I probably wouldn't recommend to make a special trip to this park , but if you incorporate it into a day in and around Dong Incheon then it's definitely worth a walk around. It's up a steep but small hill and there is great view of Incheon's port. There's a memorial to General MacArthur and the Korean War which seems to be popular with the tourists and people who fought in the War. A good Dong-Incheon day would be China Town, Jayu Park, Wolmido and ferry ride from Wolmido to YongJongdo Island."
"Park with a good view, but ...","C1 ( 2013.06.02 ) There was park to see Incheon, but nothing much to see. Forest composition and walkway was well. In the middle of the park there is a statue of MacArthur. Because I visited in weekdays, no tourists, many elderly people in the neighborhood were sitting in a chair. Worth passing, but I will not recommend."
An easy addition after seeing Chinatown...,"This only other reviews of this park have included all of the surrounding attractions...it's only logical to do so, but not exactly the same as reviewing this park. It's up a hill, a nice walk and has a good view of the port side of Incheon. A very important port, both economically and strategically during the Korean war, well known because of MacArthur's landing and turning the tide of the Korean War. A great victory, although some (including myself) would argue that MacArthur had far more faults than most people know and perhaps shouldn't be regarded quiet so highly. There's a very nice garden around his statue and plenty of locals around the hill enjoying the scenery.If you're in the area, most likely for Chinatown, you should definitely walk a bit further and see this park."
Perfect for a run!!,"3,5km flat running track - very highly to recommend!!"
Worth a Day Trip,"Perhaps America's best general is honored in Incheon, South Korea with his own park, statue and plaque. The man was a genius, and if it was not for him, South Korea would be 70 years behind the world, as North Korea is. The view is great, and there are some other things to do there such as: China Town, and Wolmido Park (where one of the Korean War landings took place). That park has many sports courts, hiking with scenic views, and on the ocean is a boardwalk with rides, games, restaurants, and boat tours. Take subway line 1 all the way to Incheon, across the street is China Town and area map, Freedom Park is off to the left. Then, on the same side of the street as the subway station, take bus #2 to Wolmido, and back. Walking is about 20 minutes if you feel like exercising."
