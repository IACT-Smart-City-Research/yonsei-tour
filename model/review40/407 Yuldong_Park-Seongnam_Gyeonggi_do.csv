Great city get away park,"The park is a nice quiet escape in central Seongnam. The circuit path around the small 'lake' make a great romantic stroll or running course (no bikes allowed), and it has a decent cafe on the far side. The bungee jump has been closed down, alas, but the traditional Hanok buildings and various art instillations help make it a good place to relax and take in some greenery and so on."
It's a beautiful park especially in the Autumn.,A huge lake and fountain surrounded by greens. You can take a walk and have a cup of coffee. There are lots of good restaurants near by too. So it's worth to visit.It was especially beautiful when I visited in the Autumn.Colourful leaves and the pond and blue sky made a stunning view.This park will make you feel as if you are not in the city.
Beautiful and must visit in Seongnam,"Lake Fountain, Autumn trees, Ducks and Bungee jumping (wow)...it's all there..Take a walk with your friends or loved ones or play badminton if you wish and if you feel crazy...Bungee jump...How to go there?Take Bundang line subway to station Seohyeon ...take exit 2...you will reach the basement of AK plaza mall...Exit Gate 4 of the mall and you will see a bus stop Right in front of you...take Bus no.17 to Yuldong park...cross the road through an overbridge into the parking of the park...Cheers!"
Rude worker in Bungee Jumping Yuldong Park,"The park is great, i Have nothing To say about it. But if you are going there To do bungee jumping then just look for another park. The reason is ""the Guy working there"" he is so rude To customers ""maybe just To non koreans"", so rude To the point of not letting me do the Bungee just because my poor friend couldn't muster the courage To do it before me. He is really rude and i had a bad Day because of him. Im sharing it so u dont experience what i had experienced."

Nice experience altogether,A nice Park with lot of open place. Lot of locals comes for a day leisure. Got good Rose plantation and water area. Nice experience altogether.
Good park for local one.,"C1 ( 2017.04.07 ) There was bigger with reservoir than I think. Many local people walked and ran around reservoir, and the atmosphere was good. There had several facility including bungee jumping, trail and performance area, etc. There was very good place to enjoy rest with family. The parking area was big, and 2 hours free. Only one demerit was some private tomb was located inside. It was certain that there was good local park."
Overcrowded but nice to take a walk,We went on a Saturday afternoon in Winter on one of the days that the sun was out. The place was overcrowded yet no one bumped into us as we took a walk. I would not say that you should go out of your way to see it. I wouldn't dare do the bungee either as regulations in Korea wrt to these things are a bit lacking.
A stroll in the park.,"A quiet park, good to chat and walk by a lake but I cant really say this is a great place to travel out of your way to visit. Just make sure you stop by if you are dining or staying near by."
Seoul-ace at Yuldong Park,"The only reason we went to the park was to try their 45-48 ft. Bungee Jump!!!!! We paid 25,000 won. It was such an amazing experience!!! Whilst swinging, I saw the beauty of the park. So I got two prizes for the price of one. Beauty and thrill. To get there. Go to Gangbyeon station and from there, go take the exit from a mall. Outside will be a bus stop and take Bus 17. Just tell the driver Yuldong park and he'll (or might) let you know that that is your stop :)."
Very pleasant and beautiful ,Hardly and tourists around and nice local atmosphere. Great for a nice walk or just relax by the big lake. In my view 1-2 hours will suffice to cover most of it. There is a bungee jump tower for a bit of an adrenaline dose and very nice artwork close to the temple. 
Awesome park,Awesome park! Fed the ducks and went to the playground too. Great to visit with kids. Would definitely recommend it to parents. 
Superb bungee jump experience ,"We had a great bungee jump experience. It's very good for beginners. So safety also. They will taken care all safety measures. Must visit for adventure like persons, others can enjoy the park."
heeling if you need,"Yuldong Park is located at northeast side of BoonDang, SeongNam.Around big lake, people walked or took bicycles, or got Bungee-jumping.It is one of the most favorite place to rest with lovers or family.Many restaurants are there..Korean, American, italian, chinese and japanese.I recommand salad pizza of LA BUONA CUCINA!!Reservation needed!!It's just weak point is necessary taking a car...But if you visit BoonDang, you have to go!!"
Yuldong Park a must visit in Seongnam,"This is an amazing park, very nice to walk in a true nature.Just go & spend 2 Hours or so, we walk & then have little rest in the cafe' @ the end of the park.This park has a nice sea view."
Book theme park in South Korea.,Very nice place. People use to visit this place relax there for the entire day. Take a walk around the lake. Bungee jumping is there of 45 meter. But in case of bad weather it will be close. Middle of the lake there is 130 meter high fountain. Park is so clean and you can relax from your all tension. I really love the place. Cute kids will be playing. There is a fee for bungee jumping.
