Good eco park!,Front staffs was helpful and I could borrow wheelchair. The eco park was huge open field and had a dome building with five climate zone where I could see various flora and fauna. For the first time I saw desert fox and they were so cute. I think this place has interesting possibility to grow ripe well with good management and time.
One of the best tourist attraction in Korea,"You can see various animals originally reside in different area - dessert, tropical area and etc. I strongly recommend this place to visit if you are a foreigner staying in Korea for months and don't know where to visit in Korea"
Very good place to children and traveller.. National Eco Park.,"CY ( 2015.12.29 ) I and my wife visited there for walking because I heard there was big place and good place to walking. I didn't expect but there had good place, ""Ecorium"". This Eco park was divided 5 section by climate. There was many tree and animal for exhibition, that was good. There was up to the mark, I think."
Botanical garden meets natural history museum,"I recently spent a wonderful afternoon exploring the entire Ecoplex and left feeling pretty inspired.The biodomes are fantastic, both to look at from a distance and to explore inside. The emphasis is more on flora than fauna which will appeal to those who appreciate not seeing cage after cage of miserable zoo displays. There are a few animals around though - mainly fish and reptiles but a few mammals along the way too. And a few hyperactive penguins in the polar display.Almost all the interp panels are in Korean, though with English taglines. Anyone with a basic grasp of ecology will be able to figure out what is being conveyed, and if not, the gardens are worth a wander anyway. I thoroughly enjoyed the expansive grounds beyond the biodomes -- plenty of interesting plant and birdlife abounds in the wetlands. There's also a cool eco-themed playground for the little ones.Well worth a visit if you are passing through this part of Korea, and incredible value at 5,000 won/adult, (approx US$5) - less for kids."
