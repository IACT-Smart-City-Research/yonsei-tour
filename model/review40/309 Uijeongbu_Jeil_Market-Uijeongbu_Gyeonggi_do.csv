Great outdoor market,"Off Rodeo drive and the green street is blocks and blocks of markets. Fresh fish and meat, dried foods, fruit and veggies, prepared food and plenty of shops. A good amount of it is covered so rain or shine you can visit. Pretty cheap for most things. "
First to be there,Uijeongbu jeil market-First time to be there found very nice toppoki. Boss is very nice and friendly however we have language barrier. 
incredible market experience,"A real market shopper's market, only come here if you have hours to spend or if youknow exactly what you need or want and where to buy it. has anyone ever told you not to shop when hungry? Nevermind that here, there are stalls and stalls of all kinds of Korean comfort foods being cooked up fresh from market open to close. Sample some kimchi or a pancake or some fried chicken. Try the noodle dishes or dried fish or stew chock full of vegetables but try something! Not into food,herbs,spices; there are plenty of household goods and clothing items as well. There is something for anyone at this partially open air market which is the largest remaining market of its kind in the area. Watch out for cars and motorcycles and scooters in the street surrounding the market as these are always tightly packed with foot traffic as well. Try to check out the basement floor as well with more shops for clothing,shoes,purses and all kinds of cellphone covers. No trip to the area is complete without a stop here.Before there were sterile supermarkets this is how the world shopped and it is a far more interactive experience. Language is not the issue some might envision so don't let that stop you either."
"30 Years Ago, Changes","30 years ago I met my wife of 29 years. One of the places we used to go to was this market. Much smaller then. Now it has grown to be a very large market show casing just about anything you may want from a market. Fish, Chicken, Pork, Beef, Shell fish of all kinds abound, Crafts, clothing, pots, pans knives and oh so much more. If you head thru the market towards the west side you will find modern shopping district with anything from McDonald's to conventional Korean. Something for everyone to enjoy."
