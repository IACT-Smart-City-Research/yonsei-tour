Didn’t expect to be that big ,"Entrance fee 5,000 won and free for senior and disable as this place is not wheelchair friendly. Thank God my aunt could walk a little so those part that cannot be pushed on wheels.... she had to walk slowly.."
Great! Never knew a stone could be so interesting!,"Half science, half art. A museum dedicated to the formation of the igneous rocks in the area, tectonic plate movements, volcanic eruptions, formation of lava tubes, and various methods of making craters. Extremely interesting!Then rock art. Lots of interesting rocks from around the island, arranged in a way that makes them just so fascinating.Budget a couple of hours here for a leisurely walk through these sections. Add a couple more hours to see the historical village section (which we didn’t go into as we had seen these elsewhere already)."
amazing! ,"This place exceeded my expectations, it is definitely a highlight of Jeju, it is perfectly organized to be a journey itself. We spent around 3 hours walking around ( it has 3 different routes well explained in the map) and simply feeling the nature was already healing. The entrance is 6.000 Korean won per person. They have drinking fountains and toilets inside. You can reach it by bus!"
Amazing Park & Museum,"Jeju Stone Park exceeded our expectations. So much space and everything well laid out. The museum was particularly interesting with some absolutely amazing pieces of lava, and microscopes set-up, which my 9-year old Daughter loved. They also had an interesting photography exhibition (temporary). If you are a geologist and/or simply interested in volcanoes and rocks, then you will probably spend all day here. Appreciated the water machines everywhere but the restaurant was closed (just in case you are hungry). We all enjoyed it immensely. Children less than 12 are free and adults are KRW 5000 (very reasonable). "
"Unique, truly unique.","Keep in mind, the founder, Paek Uncheol, is quoted ""“Visiting the park is intended to be a journey through the mythology of the island, entering through the ear of Seolmundae*, progressing through the body and exiting at the feet. It represents the journey of life and death.” Taking a journey that ends in death, even if it is a metaphoric (mythical, mystical, mind-boggling) death, may not appeal to everyone, but it could be transformative if you're open to it. Allow for hours of contemplating stones, thousands, tens of thousands, of stones, natural, carved, authentic, replicas - millstones, mortars, volcanic bombs, boundary markers, 2000 ceramic jars, fossilized tree roots - locals thought its creator, who collected these stones for forty years, had gone mad. Three courses to follow, each taking one to two hours. *Seolmundae Halmang, the grandmother of Jeju Island."
Special,We spent over 3 hours in the park and exhibition building.Gives you a perfect view on the history and evolution of mother earth. We really enjoyed and learned a lot.
History Geography and culture of Jeju all in one,Jeju stone park was not part of the regular sightseeing itineraries and do we opted for a customized private tour to visit Jeju stone park. Requires atleast 3 to 4 hours if you want to walk along the trails to cover entire area. A visit inside the museum to understand the volcanic activities and formations will help in understanding the nature of the island better. Good to go with a local guide. Interesting statues and rock formations 
"Requires time, nice at good weather","The park is a unique in the sense that it is dedicated to stones in Jeju culture. Lots of statues, pavilion with the history of volcanic activity, some traditional houses, old sculptures, big and small. Large space, a lot of walking."
Great Spot for Photos,"Jeju Stone Park is interesting. There are lots of great spots for photos and there are also lots of stone exhibits which infuses some aspects of history, culture and art."
Silently spectacular ,"This attraction would be hard to describe. A huge park with magnificent exhibits of boulders and rocks. The park was so silent but the exhibits made their statements loud and clear. An enjoyable afternoon just to immerse in the natural beauty of something as common as rocks, pebbles and such. Who would have imagined that such an outdoor exhibit could offer so much. There’s even a mothers’ nursing room within the park itself. "
One oа the must do!,"I traveled in early December and sea side wasn't a priority, and then I found this park. The monuments you are going to see at all kinds of markets of Jeju all come from this park. If you want to have some quiet time wandering in forest and looking at these cute monuments - stone park is a must do!"
Story of stone by mythology,I have ever seen best museum .. design of museum is really has deep sense of existence .. stone’s story and Jeju story are melted in the same pot.. enviromental style is exiciting.. authum’s color bring good sense.. I exactly advice..
Must visit ,"Massive ground. A full walk about will take 2hrs easily. Even though all the stones look similar after an hr, it's a very effective way to understand the folklores of Jeju. Cheap entrance fee of only 2K won.Some places near the museum are still under renovation when we were there. "
Very nice outdoor park,Nice stone formation and park. It maybe very hot during summer time. But worth a visit. I went there via public bus and you can also visit ecoland just across the street
Nice historical place,Definitely you need to visit this Stone Park so you could understand how Jeju people develop. Very nice place to visit.
Loved it!!!,"It was such a pain to get to but I loved the Stone Park. The main reason was to see the Dol hareubangs - the stone sculptures which represent Jeju. There was information about the mythology surrounding the formation of Jeju which was at times mind-boggling and contradictory. There are different routes around the park and there is an indoor exhibition which features the volcanic rocks and Jeju's origins as a volcanic island. I preferred the outdoor sections where the use of stone in Jeju was highlighted - used in things such as tombs/ shrines, walls, icons of spiritual beliefs etc. The largest sculptures are near the exit and the Dol hareubangs were awesome. They all had slightly different expressions and quirks which was cool. There are plans to expand the museum grounds and I would defo like to go back again in future. It was quite quiet when we were there and we only saw a few people except for a group on a guided tour at the end. Such a shame there are not more visitors but good for those who made the effort. Recommended visit in Jeju!"
nice for photos,"we took some interesting shots. cool place to spend some time outdoors, it's not too big and easy to walk around. definitely worth going there!! in fact, we thought this was pretty much the most interesting thing in Jeju"
Hidden Gem!,"Built on a reclaimed land-fill site, this vast area of pathways, statues, displays, museums and traditional villages is very worth a visit if on Jeju. From the impressive stone structures and flat basalt 'floor' at the entrance of the park, I was blown away by the vast array of statues that are displayed, explained and on show in this area. There is ample car parking that is only a short walk form the entry way. A small fee is required and then you are free to wander the area that included a massive and spectacular 2 store (below ground) museum that outlines the geographic development of Jeju along with many interactive displays, a short film with subtitles, examples and galleries of 'stone art'. A gift shop of course, provided a range of traditional and specific items and there are amenities spread throughout the part. Water features, a traditional village, an art gallery and a vast array of stone sculpture will give you hours of things to view and read as you wander through the park In my humble opinion, not to be missed!!!"
"Interesting place, worth a guided tour","You can easily spend 2 or 3 hours walking around the stones and getting to know the past lifestyle of the island population as well as the geological history of Jeju. Volcanic rocks are exposed as real art pieces in a museum, allowing you to have a different look at them and admire the work of nature."
Nice outdoor walk among K-menhirs,This is an unexpected indoor/outdoor museum. To be visited on sunny day. This museum depicts the stone culture of Jeju island with lots of interesting structures. It is entertaining for the kids.
Amazing! Must see,This is an amazing collection of natural and men made stones in Jeju. In addition it has an outstanding water instillation and an indoor unique museum. Truly worth the visit 
"Very different, interesting, and peaceful","We were coming from Hamdeok Beach to the Jeongbang water falls and happened to directly pass by this place on the highway and I remembered it was one of the top places to visit in Jeju so we decided to pull over and enter. We're very glad we did. We spent about an hour there but you could easily spend more time. It was awesome to see all the man made stone statues and their significance or their meaning, one of the main ones being the mother who had 500 sons. The museums were pretty cool as well and you could learn a ton of geography. The setting was very picturesque with Mt. Halla in the background and the surroundings looking like you were sort of in a savanah. We took some awesome photographs and learned a lot of information. I think if you're able to rent a car and drive there it's a must see in Jeju."
If you plan to take bus...,"I am not able to visit this park because of the bus. We went to the airport by bus in order to take the 131 bus for the park. To confirm this info from our hotel receptionist, we asked the airport tourist info counter. Correct, and we were directed to gate 1 and begun to wait for the bus. We missed the 1240 so we decided to wait for the 1340. The bus didn't come until 1400 and we went to double check with the info counter. Then we were told that 1340 is for the number 132, which is grouped together with 131. 132 doesn't head for Jeju stone park and we were told to wait for the 1530 bus. Isn't it amazing our bus waiting experience? I am sharing this as a gentle reminder for all. Plan your bus schedule properly especially for venues outside the city. Cheers"
Worth a look but still a work in progress,"From Segiowipo (Jangung rotary) the park can be reached in a little over an hour on the 231 bus which will drop you at the front of the park. Fare 1200krw. Park admission is 5000krw. I spent 2.5 hrs here doing course 1 and 2. I think you might enjoy it more if you were an artist but I liked it all the same. The stone museum, which is the first stop on course 1 tells you all about how lava rocks are formed, their different types and would be a geologists dream. After that you'll walk around the park and see the different stone sculptures, most of which are natural, some manmade. There are also a couple of replica traditional jeju houses and local pottery too. The Obaek gallery has some driftwood on display along with 1 hall of art but it is mostly empty. I thought there would be more info on the local traditions and how they lived but the park is still a work in progress. Its not due for completion until 2020. Rug up because it seems to be colder here than other areas of the island and you will be outside most of your visit. Recommend you go on a sunny day as this area gets very heavy fog too."
at least 3 hours to go through everything,"this is a very interesting park, they have at least 3 sections; a museum, 2 parks and smaller exhibits. If you like stones and interested in how they are formed and how they look like and appreciate by the people of the past and present, do visit. some stones have interesting tales like: Goddess and her 500 Sons. The whole park is pretty big, it can take up to more than 3 hours if you go through all the writings and descriptions. do go after a meal."
Jeju Stone Park - Jeju Snow Park!,"We agreed that visiting the Jeju Stone Park in the snow was one of the most enjoyable experiences we have had in Korea. The stones, sculptures, houses and other artefacts, as well as the lovely walks are beautiful in the snow. It also meant only a few people were visiting, so it was very peaceful and serene. The museum was excellent, very educational, and we really appreciated how the different lava types were displayed as sculptures. They are beautiful, nature’s art!"
A world class cultural park - something different,"It is a museum as well as an ecological park related to stone culture in the lives of Jeju people. It is huge and you are required to walk a lot. It is about 40-45 minutes drive either from Jeju Airport or Seogwipo area. You need 1-2 hours to go around the complex and the museum. Opening hours: 0900-1800 hrs. Closed on first Monday of the month unless it is a holiday. Entry fee: KRW 5,000. It should be a MUST in your itinerary of Jeju Island."
Ready to be stoned?,"The Park is quite a distance away from other major sights but it is different in that the star attraction are those ""grandfather stone sculptures"".Be prepared for lots of walking on easy trails. There are small pebbles everywhere so do watch the kids and carefully navigate those wheelchairs and baby strollers.The underground museum near next to the water reservoir/water sculpture is definitely for those interested in geology. It is a good place to take a break and use the restrooms as there is another set of lavatories near the car park."
A place worth visiting,"The park is big and have many to see, especially for people who don't know the culture of Jeju. It would be also good for family but since it requires lots of walks I wouldn't recommend elder people who can't walk for a long time. The weather of the day we went wasn't quite good, but the drizzle and fog made that place more mysterious which is quite special because we saw different type of scenery from those pictures you can find from the Internet."
Would have been better on a bright sunny day,"We were staying in the Seogwipo area (near the International Convention Center), so it took us about an hour by bus to get to the Stone Park. It was interesting, with some unususal lava formations, but the drizzling rain didn't help in enjoying the scenery. The ""museum"" is OK, but nothing spectacular. When you (if) select a sunny day!"
Great place for photograph ,"One may think that stones and rocks are boring, but not at Jeju Stone Park!It is fascinating to learn about how Jeju is geologically formed and see these amazing sculptures. "
A surprisingly beautiful park,"We travelled using the Jeju City tour bus and stopped here after visiting Jeomul Natural Recreation forest . There were other stops but we did not get down to visit the other places due to time constraints. Initially, we planned to only visit for an hour but the park was surprising large and interesting and we ended up spending over 2 hours here. It was time well spent. We saw lots of stone statues and products in all shapes and sizes. The displays of rocks and rock formations were scattered all over an extensive outdoor park as well as an indoor museum. You need to wear comfortable shoes, wear a hat and apply sun block. Toilets were clean and strategically located around the park and clean drinking water was available in many places. You only need to pay a small entrance fee and it was well worth it. There was even an air-conditioned resting hut with hot/cold water and seats just outside the entrance. In our opinion, we think this is the most interesting stop on the public tour bus circuit. Highly recommended."
A connection with nature,"My husband and I went to the Jeju Stone Park to see the guardian statues (Jeju stone heads) but found the park to be so much more than that. It's a large park (and they are still enlarging it) with an emphasis on nature. The museum and historic buildings are interesting but walking around the grounds was the high point. Rocks in their natural shapes are placed throughout the grounds and if you are quiet and observant, the connection to nature just seeps to your being. We found the place strangely intriguing, calming, and uplifting."
Jeju Stone park with a different taste,"Hi all!, we visited this place on 1 July, 2017. It is indeed a good place. when you are almost fatigued with seeing big big places such as Seopjikoji, Seongsan sunrise peak, you can visit this place while returning to Jeju si. the entrance is really amazing. Lots of tall and large stones will welcome you. We took lots of pictures there. There are different carvings of stones of different types. There is a gallray of stone-made sculptures. We also noticed a nice water reservior type of thing. Really nice place."
Nice walk around,"Nice walk around to see different carvings of stones which we took lots of picture with. Not spectacular, but nice to see. There is a small entrance fee."
Grandpa Stone,"An outdoor gallery of stone sculptures. You can find a lot of Jeju stone icon, as they call it ""Grandpa Stone"". The park is very large, and not many visitors. An interesting place worth visiting ."
Fun for the whole family,"My six (6) year old son's imagination could really run wild here. We had a blast, plan for a 1/2 day. Chicken place across the street for the hungry."
All about stone,Not worth the entrance fee and time spent at the park. Unless you really have no other attraction sites to visit.
"Cold, but awesome","We're her during the off season. This was a great Museum for a cold day- on the inside. The outside was beautiful and would have been great to explore on a warmer day. Loved the lifestyle displays of ancient Korean life (kitchen, agriculture)."
Interesting,"The park covers a vast area. One has to decide how far you wish to explore and watch your time. A map is given at the ticket counter and we did not expect it to be so big. We went according to the numbered stops. The view was spectacular for some parts of the park that we spent so much time on taking pictures. We tried to move quicker however, in the end, we did not even complete Course 1 (there are 3 different routes). It was enjoyable for some walk & laughter. There are scripts on stones to tell you about the legendary story of this stone park. You may decide, whether you want to keep walking and cover the whole park (I am not sure whether this is even possible in a day) or would you just want to have a feel of this peaceful and beautiful park."
Fantastic place to visit,"I got the bus here from Jungmun - a couple of hours in total but it was worth it. Really good value, lots to look at, peaceful place to walk around, beautifully done and looked after. There weren't many other people there so it felt as if I had the place to myself. I had lunch in the restaurant and that was also good. Make sure you take your camera. Hugely recommended."
Jeju Stone Park,We also went to Jeju Stone Park. Easy to find and approach with car. Parking places are available but during peak season the earliy bird .....Entrance fee with 5000 Won for adult and 2000 Won for child. It is a nice walking area with a lot of big and small stones. Dont forget your camera to bring. Inside there is also a huge museum with history of vulcano eruptions and of course with history of Jeju. Mainly in Korean but it it is definetly worth to visit. It is a very nice place and we would come back again.
Loved it,"This was a very relaxing walk, not strenuous and a good place to take lots of pictures. I enjoyed it immensely. "
Special site,"Juju is a volcanic island. From pre-history it's peoples worked the stone. The park concentrates, in a beautiful setting, works from all periods.Free entrance for senior citizens (over 64)"
It's basically a grave yard!,The initial part was fine. There are 3 routes within the park. Route 1 was ok. Route 2 was getting creepier as one approached further into the route. What they didn't tell you is that this is a graveyard from the ancient times and we were walking around the graves. 
Impressive Park,Visited the Park based on TA reviews. Extremely well done with extensive museums and stone displays. Allow at least 3-4 hours for the visit. Enormous work has gone into the development of the Park. Should be in the Top 5 attractions in Jeju outside the beaches.
Replica is the name of the game,"So, one might think that this is a great place to see artifacts or historic pieces, but as far as we saw, everything was a replica. To include the replica lava tube entrances. Sigh. They couldn't even be bothered to completely thatch a straw hut- they had concrete roofs with thatch done at the top and edges. They do have quite the array of carefully placed rocks and replica stone statues, but seeing as how none of it was real (the whole thing was built on the site of a landfill) there are more real things to go do on Jeju. The price is cheap. Spend it looking at the columnar basalt on the beach. At least that is real."
huge park,beautiful park with small huts with various traditional items in. Stone grandfathers are the best bit. Lovely receptionist called us a taxi after our visit.
A must see in Jeju,Nice park and a great way to know about the history of the island.amazing grand sight of the rock formations.Rocks & stones everywhere. Beautiful landscape. There are nice traditional houses in the park.
A pleasant surprise,We didnt expect much from this park but was taken in by the amazing grand sight of the rock formations. There is also an interesting folk tale behind these formations. The scenery was beautiful and there was many small trails to explore within the park.
Beautiful park,"Rocks & stones everywhere. Beautiful landscape. There are nice traditional houses in the park. No need to go to the museum which is quite far in. Just explore the area near the entrance, see the traditional house, go straight to the exit area. Lots aboriginal statues near the exit. Statues are like those found on Easter Island."
Surprisingly amazing,You might think a stone park is boring. But it turns out not quite right a statement. Not too many people visit it. You can enjoy 3 different routes. Very calm area with increadible examples of what the nature can present. 
Rock and rock,"I find it as an average, nothing special ... better to walk around outside the stone park,the surrounding is quite nice with traditional hall nice traditional look toilet (no hot water, water is icey cold) I came last month (early May)"
A must in Jeju!,A must visit in Jeju. Nice park and a great way to know about the history of the island. I joined a tour to visit this place as it is more convenient to travel privately than the public transport.
Too many great stones,"Definitely a lot of stones on this island! Discovered and are displayed and arranged beautifully. Thanks to Korean holiday week, our visit was free of charge."
"Quiet stone exhibition, all about stones!","This is a big area in the outskirts of Jeju city, need to car to get there. There are many stone formations around the park and there is story of an old grandmother who had 500 kids and was finally cooked in the porridge and the kids ate her as they didnt know. There is a nice stone museum that explains how rock formation on Jeju is formed and all about volcanic activities and some weird looking rocks. Educational place for kids!"
A unique mystical place,"This is a strange wonderful mystical place. A work of art on a grand scale, a hommage to the volcanic, mineral nature of this island, and also to its ancient gods. "
Statues galore,Great place to visit on Jeju. We loved the path 2 at the village part. But actually all of it was amazing. 
Jeju Stone Park,A great place to learn about history and culture of Jeju. Stone museum is a must-see for those who are interested in geology. Views of the Sky Pond reflecting nearby mountain are fascinating. There is a small traditional village. You can borrow an audio guide at the ticket office for free.
Stone Park,"It is definitely a park full of stones, but it is actually quite interesting. There is also a museum in the park which is worth checking out. It shows some of the history of the island and the different types of volcanic rocks that can be found on the island. If you aren't interested in parks or rocks this probably isn't a place you would enjoy, but my husband and I really enjoyed it. Naturally shaped rock sculptures, carved rock sculptures, stacked rock sculptures, etc."
Just Another Roadside Attraction,"Jeju has a park or a museum for just about everything. And so it is with Jeju Stone Park. It does have some interesting rocks.You know, some people think that Halla san is the volcano on Jeju. But, really the whole island is a volcano. If the volcano erupts again you will not have to worry too much about the lava flowing from Halla san because lava will be flowing from every little mountain on the island, which a lot of them are closer to where you live than Halla san. So, just about anywhere on Jeju you can find interesting rocks.especially along the coast. Even though it would be a nice walk around the park, you can just look out your window to see interesting rocks you don't necessarily have to go to the Stone Park. But, if you don't have anything to do and want to spend the day outside and see part of Jeju along the way, Jeju Stone Park might be a good way to spent the day."
Interesting rocks,it is a good place that you can learn about their history of Jeju. Jeju is formed into beautiful islands because of many rocks around it. 
Excellent park for stone lovers !,"We went to the park by a convenient bus form jejy city. If you are a scientific or a stone-lover, this is the place to go !!If this is not the case (as it was for me), I would also recomment the park as you have a few impressive stones !"
Educational trip in a stone garden,The museum is excellent. you get to understand how Jeju island is formed and the geothermal activities.The ground itself is hugh. It takes about 1-2 hours stroll.It is cold and windy in Dec.
Very beautiful and educational place,"Most of the park is outdoors, and we went when it was raining, so that wasn't that good. But the place is beautiful, with trees and stones lined up. There's also a museum about volcanoes as well as statues of historical figures. Very nice place although it is only accessible by car and very difficult to get a cab."
A must-go place to understand Jeju,"This is the place you must visit if you want to understand why stones especially volcano rocks are so important to the people of Jeju. This place provides all the history about Jeju Culture as well as nice scenery for photo-shoot. The place is well-kept and huge. But, the trail is nice to walk with lovely autumn weather. Admission is only krw5000. Take bus 720 from intercity bus terminal."
The place you can see things which is Jeju-style,"Jeju stone park was rated A by Korea Ministry of Culture and Tourism, in recognition that this park is excellent in term of its specialization in the theme of stone, differentiation from other facilities, and characteristics relating to mythology and the life of the people in the region.Get the map at the entrance and follow guided park course. Don't miss out the Jeju stone museum to know how the formation of Jeju Island. After a short nice walk from the entrance,the museum is just located in the basement of a building opposite the Sky Pond. Follow the map to look for Jeju traditional village with thatched roof houses. Before at the end of course, drop by the unique Gallery in the park which you may find artworks of domestic and foreign artists.It is indeed best travel Korea during Autum because even though it was sunny day, but the breeze was so cooling and the air was very refreshing. It is a museum as well as an ecological park. It is a very remarkable cultural park which sublimating nature in art ,really very fantastic."
Fascinating park., We got a local bus to this park. When we went there it was quite windy so take a sweater.The park is very large with lots of stones to see. There is no cafe so take water or food. It is really worth the visit.
interesting,i went here in heavy rain. not much to see. but im having good time here with my friends. there are a lot of stones sculpture here. and also theres a museum regarding jeju.the museum tell us about types of stone. and the jeju itself formed by the volcanic activity happened before this.
Nice place to learn and take picture,There are lot of naturally formed stones from volcano eruption. There is also a museum where they teach and share about volcano eruption and a nice place to take pictures with the stones where they have arranged it nicely. 
Interesting,"Plenty to see here including traditional houses, a museum and plenty of... stones. Nothing special but a nice place to enjoy a walk."
Enjoyed our walk around this place,Initially we weren't sure what to expect here but it is a very pleasant park but you will need around 1.5 hours to complete the whole circuit. Worth a look.
Great lava stone display,A must see really - seems a bit underrated. Almost no people when i went. Take a gorgeous stroll through the park to see different lava stones. Get educated about the geological activity. See some traditional houses.
Excellent natural lava stone exhibit,"This is the best stone exhibit on Jeju island. And the best part of that is the museum itself. There are many, many very interesting stones shapes, all collected from Jeju (I think). If you like geology, there's a great explanation of lava types, stone formations, lava tubes, etc. Also there is a nice drift-wood display with very unusual, artistic shapes. Outside, there are many carved stone artifacts used by Jeju islanders from ages past. The Obaek Jang-Goon Gallery has a nice drift-wood display in the basement. Park is big, but except for the museums, just a walk-through is enough. I spent 2 hours in the museums -- the best part!"
Nice on a cloudy day,We've been here on a cloudy day which gave a nice touch.It's a pretty wal trough the park and they show as well some old korean buildings.It's more nature than the eco park next to it...
One of the best place,"Beautiful scene to be seen. Very natural. 20,000 stones of different verities. Natural as traditional village houses in India. Toilet facilities are everywhere. Very clean. Dogs and cats are not allowed.Water fountain is there. very good place for peace, health and meditation.Thanks."
So quiet and peaceful,This is a pretty big park that has a little bit of everything from history folklore and stones. I had to convince my friends to check it out and only won when i told them it was like 15 minutes from where we were staying. However they both were quiet happy with the decision since it was empty and just a lovely walk through nature with some great smells. Even the trash cans are made out od stone pits. I thought we would only go for like 30 minutes but ended up being there for an hour and a half. Other bonus is that for the month of may there is no entrance fee!
Surprisingly good for a place dedicated to stones,"I quite enjoyed this place. It takes a while to walk around so don't go if you are in a hurry. If you take your time there is plenty to see, ancient tombs, traditional housing/tools, stone statues, giant stone towers, etc. The museum was also good and I learnt a bit about volcanic rock formation that I hadn't seen before."
Amazing,It's been several years since we have been but I can't stop talking about this place. Definitely worth the stop weather it's for half the day or half an hour a walk around this place will not disappoint the outdoor enthusiast or even the person who likes a causal stroll around a park. There are many different things to check out. All around an amazing site.
D not miss this if you go to Jeju,"Spectacular. Jeju is known for it's coastline, but Jeju Stone Park in the interior is an absolute must-see.Words can not do it justice. Just see it."
big stone,rockbig stonevery good art jobthere are artficila lake made by bronzewow~
Must Visit This Place!,"I loved this seemingly unassuming place that I would have never really thought of visiting. It was one of the most interesting and beautiful places I visited in Jejudo Island. It is definitely a ""must do"", as they say in Disney World! We would have loved to spend more time there. It's not just a park with a bunch of rocks so don't miss out! It's like a natural museum/art gallery of indigenous Jejudo volcanic rocks with a splash of the island's history. Highly recommended to spend a minimum of 3-4 hours here!!"
Does what it says on the tin,"My rating for this may be a bit harsh as I really don't know what I expected of this. It is quite literally dedicated to stones/rocks. The museum is quite a stark architectural building reminiscent of cold war Russia, flat and straight lines and all concrete. Having said that there are some really informative exhibits on the tectonic shifts and volcanoes and this general area of geology so if I had an interest I would have scored more highly.It was an experience and I was glad I did it but it's not for all."
We like this place,"This place is huge!If you like nature, do visit Jeju Stone Park. The English audio guide was excellent. The exhibits were really interesting. There were indoor and outdoor exhibits. Do be selective if you have limited time. One could easily spend up to half a day at this place.As we were a bit short on time, we browsed through the indoor museum rather quickly and still managed to pick up some interesting information.The outdoor areas were really nice and comfortable. When we were there, the weather was cool and nice and we really had a good time walking around admiring the stones. It is a park that combines nature and art. We like it a lot."
Don't miss.,"Stone park is a must see one. It has big outdoor. There are a lot of big stone shapes. This park is good for natural lovers, people in all ages, Photographers and videographer. Near this place, miniature park and Eco land are there. All these 3 places can be seen in one day. So book a taxi for these 3 places. My Taxi driver charged me 90,000 KRW for 11 AM to 6 PM. Bus doesn't come frequently to these places."
no need to do all 3 routes of you are interested only in the grandfather stones,just do the first route and get out unless you want to endless tombstones. dont miss the sky pond though.
Jeju stone park,This is an amazing place. The museum is absolutely first rate. All the exhibits have explanations in perfect English. There are lots of interactive displays. If you are interested in the geology of Jeju you should come here first and expect to spend several hours. Outdoors there are 3 courses (walks) with exhibits of life in old Jeju. The exhibits are well done and English signs are excellent. This place is huge and amazingly you will have it almost to yourself. It has an entry fee of about $5. That is the bargain of the century! Don't skip any of it. It could easily take a full day if you are intellectually and esthetically inclined. It was the best thing I did on the island. I spent only about 4 hours. I would suggest you bring food and water with you. I had a few apples and tangerines. 
Beautiful & Interesting Place,"This museum is interesting if you have the keen interest in geology & history of jeju volcanic past. The entire park is very well maintained and its advisable to bring an umbrella if you're those who can't really take the sunlight.For couples who would just want to take a quiet stroll, this place is strongly recommended as crowds here are lesser as compare to other tourist attraction in jeju."
Great museum and very well put together park,"You want to know about volcanoes? This is the place. The museum is interactive and informative. And not to mention it houses some of the most beautiful natural volcanic sculptures around. There are three courses to follow in order to see what the park has to offer - taking things at a leisurely pace, this can easily take 3 hours to complete. It is well worth it though - with the some of the paths in course two taking on an enchanted forest appeal. The entrance is 5000 won, and you can get to the park on the Jeju City Tour Bus. The stops are just outside the park. A good poncho will serve better during rainy weather than an umbrella here, as there are parts of the course with low lying foliage (and the wind can be a little ferocious at times too)."
Really beautiful place + interesting museum,"The museum is quite interesting if you're interested in geology. It's nice to get a decent scientific understanding of how and why the other things you'll likely be seeing on Jeju (Hallasan, Seongsan Ilchulbong, etc.) are the way they are. If geology bores the heck out of you, then skip the museum, but don't skip the park altogether. It's really quite a beautiful place to walk around, especially if you're in the mood for something somewhat quiet and relaxing. Major crowds can make some of the the other sites on Jeju quite the opposite of that, so it's nice to find a place that's legitimately peaceful."
GREAT place to spend the day,What a GREAT place to spend the day. Entry was $5 and I did not expect much. We intended to spend 30 minutes here but ended up spending most of the day. Take a picnic and bottle of wine and enjoy the serenity of the park. For a full video review of this place check out my YouTube clip https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlgzW0VCQHw
"Enormous park, poorly maintained though","Admission fee: 5000 won each.Went during Feb 14 which is winter. It was snowing where we were there and everything was covered with snow!The whole park is really huge! If you want to walk slowly and understand everything, it might take 2 hours or so. Most of the signboards are covered with icing and snow and we couldnt read it at all to understand.Of the whole time that we were there, we see no one at all until the end, we saw 1 person. A place to go if you want to relax and have a nice walk or if you are really interested in history and stones.."
Enormous park - beautiful!,"After reading the reviews i was a bit reluctant about visiting the park but i am glad i did. I only wish i had more time to see everything, like all the small trails leading to the folk villages at the far back. This is not just for people who are history buffs, this park can be enjoyed by anyone who appreciates nature and quiet, peaceful walks. It is a windy area so be prepared if visiting in cool seasons. For only ~$5 this is a nice park to spend a few hours if you want to slow it down and be in nature."
Not my thing,"The grounds are HUGE! It felt like a nature forest walk, a geography and history field trip all rolled into one.I don't know if it's windy there all the time, but when we were there, it was freezing when the wind blew when we were in the shade.We had a tour guide who explained the various rock features and how/why people carved the stones for use in the past. But honestly, I was bored after awhile. This place had rocks/stones galore. Considering that there are so many other things to see/do in Jeju, I would give this place a miss."
Not really enjoying,"Too big n all along on yr own,Some exhibits are not well maintained. Video inside seems not working. Unless you like stone, u may consider to skip and try others"
Only if you're interested in history,"If you are interested in the history and culture of Jeju island, and of Korea, then I would recommend spending an hour or two at this park. If you aren't, or are expecting something more exciting, skip it. For me, who lives in Korea and is already familiar with much of Korean history, I wish I had gone elsewhere. True to previous reviews, it was beautiful, but so is most of Jeju, and there are many other places more beautiful than the park itself. Overall: if you don't care about the history behind the park, it's 2 hours of looking at rocks."
Historical creature,Gimme a good information about korean people in the past. The wind were killing me! It would be better if you come not in the weather transition.
Beautiful surroundings,"My boyfriend and I just visited the Jeju Stone Park last weekend. The park is huge with lots to see! Plan to spend a couple hours here. The history and legends are so interesting and the sights are really gorgeous around the park. We took a taxi from Hamdeok Beach but were able to catch the bus very easily back to Jeju City for only 1,000 won. The only thing I'd suggest is making sure to eat before you get here or bringing food! They have a restaurant but it's closed and looks like it will be for a while. Other than that, really great park!"
Amazing- Like being in the movie Prometheus:),"Beautiful, haunting, natural. An absolute must if you're based in Jeju city (can be accessed via the city tour bus) and is amazing value for money (just 1,500 won). A definite must."
Beautiful!!,Great place to see and explore.... Highly recommend. Beautiful place with many great outdoor sights to see. Also an indoor museum of rocks but not as interesting as outside.
Beautiful Park,"Beautiful ""Stone Grandpa"" displays in multiple setting. A nice walk around the park and also learn about the local culture and history."
