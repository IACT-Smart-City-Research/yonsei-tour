a bit of a scrambling,"I wanted to run to the top in the early morning, but several sections required the use of hands as the path seemed to go over big rock slabs. Going down required some caution as well, but luckily the rocks were dry. The view from the top with the sun rising was fabulous as was the panorama of Seoul. The round trip from the entrance of Seoul National University took me a bit less than two hours. (Since I do not read Korean, there may have been another and easier path.)"
great hike!,"my friend and I started climbing the mountain at about 3pm starting at sadang, and ended 7.15pm at gwachon city hall. we are both relatively fit (though I do badly going down rocks) but we found ourselves trying to beat the night! super awesome hike though. the trip up was relatively easy with loads of stairs, though note that the actual elevation would be more than 600m given that we would have to traverse a few small hills before getting to the peak from sadang. going down towards gwachon had less of such small hills, but the trails were not well marked and there were very few stairs, so do have your online maps with the trails ready (I used maps.me) in case you get off course (we did a few times). I would recommend bringing some light snacks and a hiking stick along -- they certainly helped me with keeping my balance scrambling down those rocks and gave me the much needed energy boost when my legs got wobbly.highly recommended hike, in all. the route is very scenic even though the peak itself is not very interesting. :p"
Great hike and stream for splashing,We thoroughly enjoyed our hike at Gwanaksan. We parked at Seoul National University and had an easy walk to the trail entrance. We kept to the path along the stream and stopped a few times for a dip and to cool off. Beautiful location and so easy to drive and park here. Our only complaint was you had to make an online reservation for the ropes course and our phone doesn’t have Hangul which seemed to be the problem with getting a reservation. No matter course guides were there waiting for participants and the office had a few people with nothing to do but make reservations. Too bad the Internet was the only way - modern technology didn’t work in our favor to add the ropes course to top off an already fun day.
Birds eye view of the city,"We were lucky to climb the mountain on a perfect day. Started at 9 am. It was clear and 20 c. It is a steep climb though a temperate broadleaved forest. So you are out of the sun. But very steep, straight up the mountain with lots of boulders. Have good shoes, take your time and bring water. We took about 1,5 hours to reach top and hour down. By the it was about 25 c and convective clouds were forming. Going down can be hard on knees. Most locales my age had walking sticks. Really impressed with the amount of people in 50s and 60s doing the climb. It is a great opportunity to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city. Today our view was perfect. I recommend going in morning on mild days. On hot, humid summer day the hike could be quite strenuous."
A Hike and More,"I and my friend went on hiking to Gwanaksan and it was the best thing I did in Seoul. It was very exhausting YES but it was so fun too. Sharing stories with fellow hikers on the way. It was a good exercise and so many older people go there on regular basis. I would too if I live there. Up there you can see a portion of the City, if not all. Very wonderful, cover-photoable shots in the top. "
Great alternative to Bukhansan,"This is a great alternative to Bukhansan, which although great, is a bit out of the way if you are in the center of Seoul and short on time. I recommend starting at Sadang because the views from that trail are spectacular."
Late start,"And not sure what to expect. The walk from the station to the entrance was tough enough. The seasoned old folks were warning us that it could be too difficult, looking at how inexperience we were. But we made it to the TOP! Not all easy and some slippery slope .... it all worth it. For the view and the sense of achievement! "
Excellent Hike in Seoul,"Mt. Gwanak, or Gwanaksan, is an excellent hiking option for anyone in Seoul who wants to get away, but not have to travel too far. Completely accessible by metro, this mountain is not the tallest, but it offers great views from the summit and has a temple that is dramatically set on the edge of a cliff - very picturesque! Like many hiking trails in Korea, there are a ton of stairs to climb, but there are also rocky parts that add some variety to the hike. I would say this is an intermediate hike. Not easy, but definitely not too hard technically. There are restrooms along the trail, but no toilet paper, so bring your own. Also bring plenty of water and a nice snack to enjoy.There are other trails that begin from different starting points. Here are detailed instructions on how to get to this particular trailhead that leads to the temple on the cliff. I found these directions online and followed them successfully on my solo hike, so the instructions are tried and true. Hope you find this helpful! Enjoy!-Take subway line #4 to Gwacheon Station.-At the station, head for Exit #2 and take escalator up.-At top of escalator, just walk straight out.-You’ll see the mountain above the trees across the street.-Continue on sidewalk until you see a sign that says Library Junction. Cross the street here.-After crossing the street, turn RIGHT and continue walking.-Soon, you will see a brown sign that points LEFT toward Gwanaksan which is 1km away (the sign also mentions other destinations).-Follow that road until you reach an intersection with a sign pointing RIGHT for Gwanaksan, cross the street and continue walking (there’s a convenience store on the corner).-Continue walking (passing a school on your right) until you reach a T-intersection with big mirrors for cars to see around the corner.-You’ll see another brown sign pointing LEFT for Gwanaksan.-Continue walking. You’ll pass a parking lot on your right but that trail is for a smaller summit.-Soon, you’ll see a small food stand and a bathroom on your right.-There’s a stream coming off the mountain with a bunch of tents on the left bank.-Cross the bridge and continue up the small road past the food vendors.-You should see the trailhead."
Trail ,"I was staying at SNU faculty house and decided to walk a morning. I found the entrance to a trail at Nakseogaede Park and pleasantly discovered that it was part of an amazing trail ring of more than 150 km surrounding Greater Seoul. I, obviously, only followed a tiny portion of it, and didn't even make it to the top of the mountain. But it was a great experience. Sometimes a challenge, pleasant in general, you get great views of Seoul from many parts of it."
hidden gem for hiking,"beutiful mountain with various entertainment. if you don't want to go peak just want some fresh air from green, it has perfect side road full of flowers. if you are healthy enough to enjoy bit tough hiking you can see Yeonjuam, a Buddhist temple on cliff. you can enter the mountain through Seoul national university, the top ranked one in SK. it has soeuldae-ipgu nearby, you can get entertained with cheap gourmets and stuff. "
Awesome and Easy Hike in Seoul,I went there as part of my exchange in Seoul National University. It has a great view and many many old Koreans climb it everyday. It is steep sometimes but my friends and I who are not great Hikers managed to do it quite easily!
A great hike south of Seoul,"If ever you tire of the hustle and bustle of Seoul, head to this 600+m mountain for a nice hike. Starting from Sadang station, follow the crowd of colorfully-garbed hikers. If you choose to walk along the mountain ridge, you'll be scrambling up. Steep in certain sections but you'll be rewarded by great views. See a temple perched on the side of a cliff. "
Awesome Mountain,"Perfect view, nice length and Not many people on week days! Especially we liked the leaves with a Lot of colors during Fall time. Make sure you bring a Lot of Food and Drinks on the Top of the Mountain! "
On the must-do list for trekking enthusiasts,"Gwanaksan is one of the tallest mountains in Seoul, second only to Bukhansan, but Bukhansan is farther away from the city and you won’t get such a great view. Gwanaksan is not such a long trip to go up, especially if you take local buses such as 5011 or 5013 which take you to the mountain-side of the SNU campus and allows you to skip the not-so-interesting part of the track in the valley. If you have limited time or want to spare some energy do take this “shortcut”. The climb itself is not very hard for 90% of the way. However, once you reach the beginning of the crest to reach the peak, it can be a bit scary as you’ll have fairly steep precipices on both sides of the way. If you’re traveling with people who suffer from vertigo or with children / elderly people, I would recommend that they be careful about going to the very peak. That being said, the view is very good even if you don’t reach the very top. If you do get to the actual peak, the view will truly be stunning. There are many mountains to get a view of the part of the city North of the Han river (Namsan, Naksan, Inwangsan, Bukhaksan, Bukhansan…), but to get a nice view of the southern part, Gwanaksan is your go-to mountain. You’ll see everything from Mokdong, Yeouido, Gangnam, Lotte World Tower… Compared to the other mountains south of the river (Daemosan, Guryongsan, Namhansanseong, Gureumsan…) Gwanaksan is without a doubt the most gratifying and offers the best panorama."
Great craggy mountain,"About 630meters, with some great views of the city, and lots of climby rocks, Gwanksan is one of the best hiking mountains in Seoul. It can get busy on the weekends, so try to get there during the week. Also, don't be afraid to adventure of the main trail as there are many great and uncrowded secondary trails (that is, if you feel comfortable finding your bearings in the forest). Lots of great restaurants in Naekseongdae or even Anyang for an after hike meal."
Nice hike to the top,"This is a great, strenuous hike to the top of the mountain. 3000+ feet elevation gain in 2.5 miles. From the top you can see the southern part of the city and surrounding mountains. At the top there is the Wongaksa Temple and Yeonjuam Hermitage, the latter is hanging off the edge of a steep cliff. Well worth the visit and a photo. Take the subway to Gwacheon. Take exit 7 and continue straight along the tree lined path (NW). Turn left at the Gwanaksan road and the path up the mountain will be on the right. There are a couple paths up adjacent valleys that are mostly stairs (paths 1 and 2) which you get to by heading up to the end of the road but I ended up on a more rugged goat path that was fun. Cross the stream at the dam (left/ south), there is a small round sign that says Gwanaksan mountain path. It is a narrow trail that travels along the top of the ridge and requires a little bit of route-finding. As long as you are going up, you are on the right path. "
