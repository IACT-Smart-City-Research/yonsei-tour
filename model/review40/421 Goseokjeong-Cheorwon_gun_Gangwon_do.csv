Good view in Hantan River,"CY ( 2016.01.23 ) I and my son visited there on the way Hantan River spa. There had good view and atmosphere, but in winter there was bleak, I think. And the pavilion was need to improve to classical style, because pavilion's banister was mady by stainless. So there was tasteless. If you visited there, I recommended to visit in warm time."
Just a view,"Nice view of Hantan river and place to get some information on tour of DMZ. Walk down the stairs to take a better view of river- which is more like a stream. Just next to 고석정, there are okay restaurants which sells original stew of north Korean style and fish dumblings."
