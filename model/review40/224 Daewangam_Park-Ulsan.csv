Excellent view of rocks and ocean ,Excellent place for a walk by the sea on rocks and trails by pine trees. Lovely blue ocean and layers of rock formations by the waves. 
Breathtaking Coastal Attractions and Free Entry! ,"This is definitely one of the most beautiful nature attractions in South Korea. Walk along the enchanting forest path, passed by the lighthouse to the magnificent coastal wonder that has a beautiful legend. After the walk, why not treat yourself with some fresh sashimi caught by the Haenyeo of Ulsan! "
Absolutely stunning!!,"This was one of my favorite spots in Korea! The place was very pretty, not too crowded, the air was fresh and comforting. I enjoyed the trails and simply walking around, smelling the rich smell of nature and appreciating the very pretty natural views. Highly recommend!"
very beautiful natural tourist attraction,This is an iconic park of ulsan Is a very beautiful natural tourist attraction You can spend time to relax especially on vacation during summer.
Best place to get in touch with nature,Had a chance to visit this amazing place and the views were so breath taking! Went in summer but the sea breeze was really cooling!! Great place for photos too!Watch the video on my Instagram @xuantravelogue
zaman ,"hello,today ,sunday .i am with my friends lunch in shalimar restaurant..very good service & best food,very testy..excellent food,,"
Beautiful,"Beautiful sea side rock, small hiking, cafe and they even have outdoor fitness equipment. Morning or afternoon time will be perfect to visit this place."
Short stop over,We passed by this area after our business tour for a short walk and sight seeing. I really recommend that you don't miss this park. From dragon statue playground to rocky cliff is about 10-15min walk. There are restaurants nearby. A breathtaking view on the cliff. Diving not allowed. We didn't see anyone swimming too. Rocky area.
A beautiful place for a walk,"Such a beautiful area to walk about, it would take 3-4hours to walk around it all, little outcrops with bridges and walk ways absolutley stunning. "
Great place,take a bus no.104 is easiest because the bus stop at Daewangam entrance. Walk along the beach and take a photo with a nice view. You can try fresh seafood too
good place,"best nature lover spot , simple elegant well maintained, quite, peaceful , natural beauty, well kept "
best nature park,"very clean , green and natural park in ulsan .really liked the concept.people here are very friendly "
Must see location.Many impressive walks.,"This is a must see location.There are many walks along the water,the cliffs and in the nearby forests.You can spend many hours walkinh around.Free car parking.Great spot for kids.Lots of bird life."
Stunning!,"Wjile getting here via the city bus system proved to have its challenges, it was totally worth the effort. Lovely walking trails, lighthouse, beautiful craggy shore line...nice bridge system to get to island, serene pine trees. Restaurants at entrance looked nice but I did not have time for them, some climbing structures for the children looked fun. Gotta say there was a wonderful English-speaking information booth attendant (went to school in Tennessee--I didn't catch her name) who went above and beyond the call of duty!"
Healing,"Love this place.Allowed me to have a sense of healing looking out all around. The view of blue sea, rock structures, sea gulls, waves, pebbles...The sounds of waves crashing, the boats and ships passing, the birds...Story tells of the King and Queen being a dragon as they passed on. This place is the queen, guarding the East Sea.To get here is quite easy but can be time consuming if you intend to use the public transport other than taxi... KTX to Ulsan.. Bus 1703 just outside to Ulsan Express Bus Terminal.. At the same bus stop you alight, take bus 124.. Alight at Humansia Apartment (about 31 stops).. Turn left at the bus stop and just walk ahead. The main carpark and entrance is on the left after walking up a roundabout.If you take the Express Bus, you got to turn left outside the terminal and walk ahead, turing left following the road which will bring you past the entrance of Lotte Mall. Bus 124 is there."
Beautiful Area,"Great place to release some stress and enjoy a beautiful walk. Even though there were a good amount of visitors, the place was actually quiet. Nice photo opportunities and the dining area was fairly good as well."
Lovely park,Awesome place for a walk. Lots of ppl tho.. during weekend (my experience) there is sea food marked with super fresh catches. Lovely park for walk with beautiful coast to see
BEAUTIFUL,"My wife does not really like going to new places in Korea, because they are all the same. However, this one is very different. The rocks were so pretty."
Great seashore and cliff view ,The park has great view to cliff and small bays. It has a small fish market and observatory. There is a lighthouse nearby. One of the greatest attractions in Ulsan
"Daewangam Park, with its lush hundred-year-old pine forest","Daewangam Park, which is one of the 12 Sights of Ulsan, has a pine forest with over 15,000 trees that are about 100 years old and creates a magnificent landscape. You can smell the rich aroma of pine trees while walking along the well-established trail in the forest. Along the coastal walkway from the park to Seuldo Island, you can enjoy the beautiful views created by the wide and blue East Sea and oddly formed rocks. If you cross an iron bridge that has been made into a pillar of stone, you can stand your feet on the Daewangam."
Scenic Woods and Coastline,"Our tour group stopped at this park during our trip from Busan to Gyeongju. It was a scenic 1-km walk through a forested area to the coastline to walk among the wind and ocean-carved rocks. The large rocks are connected by foot-bridges. You can also see female divers collecting shellfish. There are signs in both Korean and English. There are toilets, restaurants, and shops by the parking lot. There is also a children’s playground.There is not much shade walking around the rocks and a hat, sunglasses, and sunscreen are recommended. The trail slopes downhill from the parking lot to the coastline and it’s an uphill walk back to the parking lot from the coastline."
Fantastic location with a history,One of the top most visited spots in Ulsan. Perfect for photo-ops. The park and its history of dragons are interesting. Its located by the shore and pine forests. The pine trees are mysterious and adds charm to its history. The bridge by the rocky cliffs is an adventurous climb. The park and the cliffs gets very windy and cold. There are cafes and restaurants at the entrance to cater to your hunger.
Breath taking sceneries,"Went there in the afternoon , couldn't stop taking picture , amazing view every where until the last rock, it was windy so the bridge crossing was really funny for me because of the wind, recommand you sunglasses so your eyes don't get watery and no hat or cap and prepare to take a lot of pictures and selfies , there is a lot of spots to capture great sceneries, and i think you can not escape the crowed, it combine mountain sea forest in one area , highly recommand if you visit Ulsan , and there is plenty of coffee shops on the entrance"
IT WAS BREATHTAKINGLY AWESOME!,It was one of the destination in our wish list during Korea's trip. I will never forget the experience. We took sweet 3 hours to reach the bridge. Totally satisfied with the view!
Daewangam park visit,I visited the park today. It is a very nice place to visit. Had a light house also inside the park. Views are mesmerizing. Rocky trails are well secured with handrails. Highly recommended for all.
Very nice visit,Daewangam park is an oasis in the industrial city of Ulsan. Great for an afternoon or a Sunday walk. Best attraction in Ulsan. Highly recommended.
Scenic beauty.,Really nice place.Would strongly recommend visiting it.Though you require around 3hrs to roam around the park.Loved the scenic beauty!!!
Excellent Walks!,Loving trails to take a walk along the ocean for an hour and can go to Seuldo if you take a walk more.
Great place to walk,"Had a free day and ventured to this park annd was pleasantly surprised. After avoiding the entrance touristy area, I walked through a lovely tree park area to coastal marked routesFabulous coastal views and amazing walks"
Beautiful,"What a place and spot for pictures. Beautiful nature, just around the beach. It makes Ulsan worth a vist."
"Nice Views, Pleasant Walk","This park is worth visiting. I spent about two hours, but you could easily spend more time, particularly if you want to eat at one of the restaurants arrayed near the entrance.There are some nice ocean views from the rugged rocky outcrop at the end of the park. There are also two lighthouses side-by-side. One was built during the period of Japanese rule, while the other is a taller, more recent replacement. The ocean scene served as a reminder of the importance of shipping to Ulsan, as the distant view was a virtual parking lot of large ships.There are benches in various places for resting, at least one play area for kids that I saw, lots of trees, and a number of trails that I didn't take. If you have half a day open in your schedule, this would be a good place to go. Thanks to the concierge at my hotel for suggesting it."
Free and full of picturesque spots,"This is a wonderful park in the Dong-gu area of Ulsan. You walk along a 1-km trail. You'll pass pine trees, cherry blossoms, and magnolias. One you get there, you'll see Ulgi Lighthouse. But the best part is when you walk down from the lighthouse to Daewangam Island, which is a rock island connected to an iron bridge. You can get great shots of the bridge and ocean. This place is popular to the locals and understandably so!"
Stunning views,I spent a lot of time walking in this park while I was visiting my husband as he was working in South Korea. The Trailways are very well-maintained and there are bathroom stops along the way. I enjoyed the outdoor exercise equipment and hold so the interpretation boards that are found along the trails
Beautiful place,This is a good place to visit both for a workout (running) or for a walk. The best time to visit is during sunrise or sunset. 
Walk in the park ,"It's a lovely park amidst the city. With lots of coffee shops and children play area at the entrance and a good trail for jogging, cycling or walking thereafter. The trails ends at a spectacular sea view. "
coastal breeze.,"Excellent coastal walk,if you start from the fishing port where the fish market is, you pass a couple of old houses, directly behind the modern gallery,where a local tends his ornate garden, whilst playing Korean classical music,it is a throwback in time..beautiful...the leisurely walk winds and bends and the views are really enjoyable,this is a lovely walk being so close to the HHI shipyard, and a great way to unwind...it takes one all the way to Ulsan beach where a cold beer and lunch can be enjoyed."
beautiful walk through pines to the rock with the bridge,This is an easy trek for almost anyone able to walk. Even a wheelchair can navigate except to the rock in the ocean. 
Beautiful park nestled in Ulsan,"It was a short walk to the rocks bt the sea where you get to see pine trees, people fishing, cats roaming the rocks and seniors exercising. After braving the cold winds blowing your hair all about, walk out to the cafes near the road for a hot cuppa. If you're still up for more adventure, walk down the steps behind the cafes to go to the beach"
It is one of the must place in Ulsan city,really enjoyed this place. Luckily it was sunny day and weather was pleasant. But if you in Ulsan city and planning to have one or two place to visit - include this place.It can be good picnic for family. Romantic place for couples.
Worth a visit if in Ulsan,"A good quick walk with a beautiful scenery, and worth taking the A trail (it has better views and less people than the main road). It isn't physically challenging or time consuming at all"
A must visit in Ulsan,"This should be on your ""Must visit places"" in Ulsan!Breathtaking sea view, captivating rock formations, refreshing ambiance, and above all, there is no entrance fee! It's all for free!"
Must visit ,"If you're within an hour or two, you have to come see this park. The rock formations are so unique and beautiful. Such a natural gem! Highly recommend. It's a stunning place. "
Good park and location,Must visit of you are at Ulsan. One of the few places to visit at Ulsan after all. The park is good and natural beauty appeals to any visitor. Recommended for any body on a visit to Ulsan
Favorite Park to hike around and relax in Ulsan!,"We love going to this park because of the cool breeze and nice shade in the summer. In the winter the wind can be a bit much sometimes, but overall still recommended for the oceanside scenery.We have ben told the fresh fish and other sea creatures sold by the little old ladies near the main rock area is delicious, but we have not tried it ourselves yet."
Worth a visit ,A well developed easy walking park with beautiful pine forests and rocky coast line. Some beautiful photo locations here. A must do if you are in Ulsan
Beautiful park,"It's a nice park for a mornining stroll. When you finally reach the waters and cross the bridge, the veiw is mesmerising."
Too much trash,"There was litter everywhere I went in this park. The east side beaches were particularly trashed. We started on the east side and walked west, so things did become less depressing, but it's hard to really enjoy the beauty when there are fried chicken boxes, cigarette packets and butts and coffee cups all over the place. "
A beauty spot of Ulsan,This is a great place to unwind and enjoy a stroll around. The best part is the crossing of the bridge to the island by foot.
Beautiful place to wind down,"Nicely created park on coast, around the underwater shrine and old lighthouse. A beacon of rest in an (eco)-industrial city!"
"Great place for family, friends or even couples on a date!",Great place for trekking or leisurely walk with the family. 1km walk to the seashore was very refreshing. It's quite windy at the seashore so be sure to bring something warm! 
Must visit while in Ulsan ,"Nice park, good sea views, great for hanging out with friends or family, many restaurants and cafes available and a convenient parking lot. Very quite in weekdays and lil busy on weekends. "
"Picturesque, relaxing, just beautiful place!","Full recommend! There are some cafes and shops at the entrance of the park, amazing walking trails as well. Beautiful pictures guaranteed, just amazing experience overall! Loved it!"
"Great to relax, great for Kids","I know this park near Ilsan Beach in Ulsan since many years. It always was a point to rest in busy Ulsan and to let kids play.You have now the option to walk up the stairs (as usual) or drive up to the restaurants near the main playground. This is new.Some years back there have been mobile booths selling this and that, they are all gone. When climbing up the stairs they appear to the right side. Here you find different restaurants to stay for a while before sending the kids back to play.On the playgrouund there is a giant dragon where the kids can to this and that. For the families there is the outlook by the old lighthouse. A renovated bridge (with light at night guides you out to the panhandle. In summer this is as an aircondicioned place with a nice fresh breeze.For runners there is a walkway all around the peninsula somewhat hilly.This place is great just to relax, do sports or let kids having fun."
Daewangam Park,"One of the best place to visit in Ulsan, south korea. Need to walk for 20 mins from the local bus stop to go to this park. Next to the park is Ilsan beach which is also wonderful. Clean place. "
Worth it to visit,"The park is close to our apartment. Even we go there twice, still can't cover the whole park. The garden is extensive and there are many interesting spots. There is a big dragon slide at the playground but not much else 'tools' for kids to play with. Next to the garden there is a lot of pine trees. People like to relax there and picnic too.Then there would be a long path to walk to the end of the rock of the sea. You really need for healthy leg and umbrella too. Just bring it and you will be safe. Before you reach the rock you will be able to see the Ulgi Lighthouses. Just spend your time there to appreciate your journey."
Excellent place for Kids and Youngsters,A must see place for people travelling to Ulsan. I walked from ulsan Beach to the park.There number of cafes on the park.
"Relaxing, windy","The area is big enough for spending the afternoon, paths are well kept and safe to walk, in any weather. "
Enjoyed the view so much,"I took a city tour bus to tour around the city. It cost 10,000 won (if you travel via ktx, I think they have discount on the city tour bus ticket). The Daewangam Park is very refreshing, with a lot of pine tree, and it's definitely a great place for jogging too. It took me about 1 hour to walk around the park. In fact Ulsan is a very beautiful city and I definitely travel Ulsan again. (Will definitely rent a car next time to see the nature side of Ulsan)"
"Lovely park area, Ulsan style",Lovely natural place to walk around and have a picnic. Lots of places to buy food and coffee too. The bridges to the rocky outcrops have recently been refurbished and this is a lovely spot with views all around. Local fish can be bought here. The children's playground is popular. Well worth a visit to escape the hubub of the city.
"Excellent place for walking, jogging and to see sea","This place is located at the end of DongGu area in Ulsan, nearly connected by Ilsan beach. Can be reached by bus, taxi (expensive). Offers great view of the sea and has a rocky beach adjacent to it. Their is a walking trail along the hill surrounding the park and a centre area offering coffee and other eatables. Ideal place for pet lovers and those with family and kids. Their is a big play area for kids and at the very end of the bridge their are locals offering fresh seafood to eat and relish sitting by the sea."
Park near my Apartment,"A nice place to visit and get some fresh air, view the lighthouse and sample local freshly caught sea food washed down with some local beer. Good parking and easy walking."
"Awesome, excellent-the best place and the must see park in ulsan","I visited this plave last Sunday and was quite impressed. The location of the beach at walking distance form the park is an additional benefit. If you are nature lover then this park is for you. At the entrance of the park are a few cafeteria and restaurants.If you have never visited a lighthouse , then do visit this park.The rocky cliffs and beautiful sea beyond make a spectacular scene. The park is open even during night time.The park offers track for cyclist and joggers.The Indian restaurant Namaskar is walking distance from the park."
A good change from the ship yard!,It is a peaceful place to walk around and enjoy the sound of the sea. I was visiting Ulsan for business and spent most of my days in the ship yard - it is a nice place to escape to and nearby (I was staying in the Hyundai Hotel). There are quite a few steps up but you can also drive there if you are not too mobile.
Wonderful,"Take a romantic walk through the park with your love one, or bring the whole family. The scenery is fantastic and you get a lot of fresh air."
Daewangam (the Great King's Rock) Park.,You can walk to the Daewangam located at the seaside which is very beautiful to see waves running high and breaking. It is very good to pass a day with family members or lovers. 
A great Sunrise spot in Dong-gu Ulsan,"With the improvements made to the area, Daewangam Park is getting better and better. While it can get particularly busy on nice days, the forest and area are best visited during the early mornings around or before sunrise. That is when there are less people and the sunrise viewed from the daewangam rocks is amazing. "
A park that has everything!,"It has everything! Coffee shops and restaurants, a lot of kilometers of hiking and bicycling trails, a lot of green, outdoor gyms, panoramic view of the ocean and of Dong Gu (Hyundai Shipyard, Ilsan Beach, etc.), impressing sea-side rocks, light-houses, an amazing Buddish Temple and many more!...A perfect place to relax or exercise after work and during weekends, if you are staying in Ulsan!"
Awesome!!,Awesome place!!! Next time your in ulsan you need to visit. It's beautiful and a quit place to walk!!
Deawonam (Great Kin's Rock?),I've been here a few times. It's a nice place to visit and go for a short relaxing walk or even a longer walk if you decide to walk throughout the entire area.. There are a lot of rock formations to see and climb on as well. It's a good place to take photos and view out onto the ocean as well as the Hyundai Heavy industries plant off in the distance. It might be good to bring some walking shoes. You could probably get away with wearing sandals though.
Stroll in the park by the sea.,"Beautiful piece of land, beside the beach of Ilsan. Like a small forest on the top of a hill, with places of cliff side, overlooking the sea. Even has a stage and audience area, right beside a cliff edge!Good for lunch time walk, or a picnic, or just a place to relax.Many surprises including a temple."
An Oasis indeed.........,"This park is in the middle of town, and yet it's very peaceful and beautiful.I remember when this area was only a fishing village a few years back and now it's a park for all ages to enjoy. I walk there about twice a week and work out on the outside gym facing the ocean, it can't get better than that."
an oasis in the middle of one of the most industrial cities in Asia,"the park is quite big, with walking trails, cliffs on the ocean, striking views of the sea between a pungent pine forest, small discreet playgrounds for kids, an old lighthouse , and well, I visit every weekend and still have not discovered it all!"
Near my home,This place complete my journey in Ulsan. i came here twice and i love it so much even it was so cold when i visit this place.
Nice Park,"This is a very nice park right down the street from my apartment in Dong-Gu, Ulsan. I spent a whole day there for my first journey, and have been back several times since. The park can get very busy on the weekends, but there are some areas of peace and quiet. At the entrance there are several cafes and shops or places to stop and grab a beer."
Amazing place to visit.,We spent a lovely day here. The scenery was beautiful and views amazing. It is most definitely well worth a visit.
Rough sea and clouds of cherry blossom,"Actually there are two parks Daewangam and Ulgi park ,waves broken on cliffs and rocky coast,white-pink clouds of cherry trees blossom,green pine trees,old Ulgi lighthouse,that what you may see there,and I believe you will enjoj these pictures,as we did."
Get away,"I needed space, needed nature. This was the place. Great for photos. Great place to take a hike. There is snack shops too and games. "
Breathtaking,"Just an amazing,gorgeous and well appointed park in the city. Ocean view, huge boulders to climb on, nice path to follow. You will forget you are in the city. Relaxing place!"
Beautiful,A really easy walk and the view is great! The water is so blue and it's so relaxing here. I could spend hours here watching people fish or dive for whatever they were diving for. 
Daewangam park for a Nice walk.,"A Nice place to be, read the stort about the dragen and why there are no seagras there. We had a Nice afternoon with fog and Sun. Nice place to take picturs"
Daewangam Park done from the air.,Fantastic formations that look great captured from an aerial camera.Check some out on RobsSkyviewz youtube channel.or below links.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxOluzHsW74http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZDf_lIVgTo
Sexy park hanging over the beach.,"Many trees, and little walkways grooved out, up on the cliff tops overlooking the sea. At the end of the furthest end from the beach you come to a walk on bridge connecting small sections of islands together.Nice option for an afternoon stroll. In the middle of the park, on top of the view of the sea, lies a stage where sometimes dances or Zumba sessions are performed!! "
Breathtaking view in Korea,"This is my favorite place in Korea for my seven years of stay in that country.The rock formation is really breathtaking and it is on the middle of the sea. You can access the rocks via man-made bridge and stairs.Since I discovered this place, I always brought personal visitors there and it never failed to amazed them.The place though is not accessible by public transport and it is advised to go there by car. If you will go there by bus, it may involve considerable walking or just ask the taxi to take you there.Once in the place, you have to walk quite some distance but along the way is quite serene. Toilets are very accessible.If you are still up for walking, try the path on provided on the side of the mountain that leads to the beach.Best to go there during spring where the cherry blossoms starts.You have to remember that this is in Ulsan, a city outside of Busan so you need to arrange your transportation. Please also remember that there is a second Daewangam in Kyungju. The one I describe here in Ulsan is way better than in Kyungju."
beautiful,We visited this location on our trip to Korea this summer. We enjoyed watching the divers bring up sea creatures. Very beautiful place to stop if you have a few spare hours to kill.
Nice walk,"It's a nice little park. The main attraction are the rocks, which are cool looking and have an interesting back story. If it's a windy day be ready to get splashed. Other then the rocks there's not much to see, but it's still a nice place for a walk. "
Nice place to take a stroll along the ocean,I was here as part of a tour group. This was unfortunate because it would have been nice to have been here on my own with time to explore all of the trails. As it was we had 1 hour in the park and we did trail A. It was very scenic and not too difficult. I did veer off the path a few times to enjoy the nature a bit more. Given the time you could spend half a day here enjoying the views and the tranquility of the pine trees.
"Lovely trees, rocks well provided with walkways","This place is a very pleasant walk from where I am staying in Ulsan. It takes about 30 minutes to walk briskly around the whole peninsular but that would be missing the point. There are many good viewing pints well connected by excellent wooden steps and walkways that lead you around the lighthouse and through the trees. There is a recently added children's playground which looks out of place but this can only been seen from the city side the rest is beautiful.Along the Northern side you will find women divers selling there fresh catches of live fish, shells and octopi. Further North you may come across a small car park where a man may be playing jazz on his saxophone!I felt like swimming but there was a fair amount of plastic and probably fishing line as there are fishermen everywhere. All in all a great place for a slow stroll and you can easily spend two hours enjoying this place and then nearby is the beach where there are many restaurants."
typhoon,"I remember this well as there was a typhoon on its way, so i didn't really see it at its best but you could tell it had much to offer! great views breath taking in fact!"
Nice ocean view,"A middle size park with pine trees forest a lighthouse and large rocks with ocean front, that creates a popular point for many to go fishing. I wish they had playground for my children; instead there are some outdoor multi stretching machines"
