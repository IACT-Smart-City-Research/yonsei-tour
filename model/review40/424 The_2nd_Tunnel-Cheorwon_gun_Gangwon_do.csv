Very Interesting History and No Photos/Videos Allowed Inside the Tunnel,"Me and my friends went there last Winter together with other foreigners thru an agency (Adventure Korea). It is not easy to enter the area (DMZ), I guess we passed thru one or two checkpoints (gate). The easiest way, I guess, is to book thru a known agency. On the area, we are not allowed to take picture at the right side where the South Korean army are located. But free to take picture at the left side or in front of the tunnel entrance. Inside, they restrict visitors from taking photos or videos. Some portions are restricted or closed. The tunnel has low ceiling which is slightly uncomfortable for tall person. That's why they provide a helmet at the entrance to protect your head. Inside, the floor is slightly wet but not slippery. Also, it is well lit and not scary. It is also safe for kids. The place is nice and interesting. I would recommend to visit the small museum outside the tunnel. Also, they have small shop where we were able to buy an authentic North Korean paper bill for souvenir."
Nice visit at the DMZ area,The JSA was closed on all of the days we were in Korea so I looked around for opinions on whether to go on the 3rd Tunnel tour without the JSA or find something else. I read about the Cheorwon DMZ area and thought it seemed interesting. Our visit was on a Monday and there were very few other people visiting for a tour. It was a nice experience and definitely was not a touristy area at all so we were able to just take in the history and stories that our guide told us.
Experience a secret tunnel dug by North Koreans,"This site is within the restricted zone, so you can only visit as part of the tours that leave from the tourist office at the Iron Triangle Memorial Hall (on weekends, or take your own car on weekdays). There is not a great deal to see but the interest lies in the experience of walking down into a tunnel which was stealthily dug by North Koreans. You are handed a safety helmet by a solider, as you walk into the tunnel. It is not particularly small (nothing like the Chu Chi tunnels in Vietnam) but there are some places where rocks jut out, so you could bang your head. You walk about 500m into the tunnel and then turn around to come back (it was rather damp and slippery so wear good shoes). Not sure what the furtherest point represents as the tour was in Korean only. There's not that much to see inside, they do point out some spots that had landmines . You are allowed to take photos at the entrance (even with the guards), but not inside the tunnel. There is also a small museum of wartime artifacts and a shop selling simple north korean goods and even army rations!"
Nice place to visit,You need to book ahead if you want to visit here. On weekends you are not allowed to take your own car so need to use scheduled tour bus. We got there on week days in winter. Met groups of eagles . Red crowned crane. And other animals like wild hog and roe deer probably only place you will find so many bunch in one place. It is just nice to drive around since there is no fraffic at all.The cave itself has nothing much to see but still is interesting and in summer it is cool place to visit. Tall ones should definately watch out for your forhead
