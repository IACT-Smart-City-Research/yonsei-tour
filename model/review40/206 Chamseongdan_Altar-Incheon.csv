Great views,Nice little hike that takes about three hours to complete. I went in fall and the colors are really nice. The trail I took was a bit steep so probably not the best for small kids. 
Very nice place to enjoy and understand ancient legend of Korea. ,Very nice place to enjoy and understand ancient legend of Korea. It is the origin of Korea. Also there many dolmans. Those are UNESCO cultural heritage. 1 and half hours from Seoul to the west. Also you can enjoy fish - Baendaeinge. 
Ancient Altar of Dangun,"Supposedly this ancient altar is where the legendary Dangun (Founder of the first Korean Kingdom) offered sacrifices to the gods roughly 4,000 years ago. We can be fairly positive most of this is myth, however the altar is indeed ancient. Dangun whether legend or half-myth is revered in Korean histories throughout the dynasties. To see the altar, you must hike to the top of Manisan Mountain on Ganghwa Island. The hike takes 1-2 hours. The mountain is not very high, but there are some very steep portions. The view is fantastic and the ancient altar is fascinating. While this attraction is not famous today for outside visitors, reading some accounts from Westerners visiting Korea in the 19th century is suprising in the knowlege of this site. Seemingly, the Altar of Dangun was far more famous about 125 years ago. If you enjoy hiking and history this is a great place to visit."
