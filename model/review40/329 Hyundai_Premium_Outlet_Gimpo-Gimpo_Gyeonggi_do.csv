Too expensive for Dubai shoppers,"Even with the tax refund the outlet is way too expensive for a shopper from Dubai!!! It way out of the reach of the city! It is closer to the Incheon airport and if you have a transit, you may consider visiting but I would not agree with shopping there! Will have to cab it there and get a return cab to the closest metro if you live in Seoul!"
Nice mall accessible from the airport,"This small mall based around the Lotte department store is a good place to kill a few hours before or after a flight at Gimpo airport. It’s attached to the underground walkway between the domestic and international terminals that connects to the subway. Nice selection of restaurants including decent Mexican, Indian and Chinese."
Very big Premium Outlet ,"Its the second time we were here. I find tgat that its a very big Premium Outlet complex, lots of walking to do. There's East, West and Tower blocks. Able to find many branded goods here. However, there's too little choice when it comes to dining. This complex and all their food outlets znd restaurants close very early, at 8.30pm. Tough time looking for place to have dinner after all the shopping. Hardly see any taxis around, too."
High quality outlet,"In this unforgettable trip, we have been to Hyundai premium outlet and lotte department store of Gimpo airport. Unexpectedly, I love HPOG so much. There are many famous brands and traditional Korean foods that you can choose. By the way, one of famous Taiwanese beverage shop as well. For instance, I bought Nike shoes around $ 60, which is really cheap compare to Taiwan’s outlet. Spend too much money- please be careful. Enjoy and have fun 比起金浦機場的樂天百貨，我覺得我會選擇在現代暢貨中心花上整天的時間，不管是男生女生都會逛的非常開心。 大推"
Huge outlet reasonable prices,"The outlet is huge composed OF about 4 to 5 connecting buildings. All known usual brands are present. The prices are varied according to present sale/promo for The day. Food stalls and restaurants are open. However, in my opinion, American outlet are still a little bit cheaper. All in all a good place to shop if you are in The area."
Bad GUCCI service ,"Terribly disappointed with GUCCI service ,the lady with her title MANAGER is a disgrace , poor English and poor service , she got irritated and angry when we asked her some information about the bag , she obviously didn't understand what we are asking and just keep dismissing us with YOU CAN REPAIR THE BAG AT GUCCI SINGAPORE . well I can do without a bag in my life but let's see if she can do without a job with this kinda of service attitude if she remain to be like that forever ‍♀️"
Nice premium outlet at Gimpo !,"Outlet with premium international and Korean brand inside, with 3 levels and few gates. Few cafes and free wifi also....across the street there are H & M store, Uniqlo and some other stores. Tax refund applies for ₩ 30.000 minimal expenses. Nice place for shopping. "
Excellent premium brand outlet,"Marvelous shopping outlet for famous international brands outlet I've ever visited.Name it....you can find almost all famous international brands there, say Ferragamo, Tory Burch, Jimmy Choo, Burberry, Prada, Miu Miu, Tod's, Channel, Balenciaga....and many more. If you can do camping.....just kidding, do so, as 1 day not enough for you to check in each and every shop"
Great shopping center,"It's a new shopping area, so everything you see there are brand new. However, you walk outside to get inside individual retail chain stores. On weekdays there a few people, so it doesn't feel like a place for shopping. Also, I remember there wasn't a place to eat nearby (no restaurant). Overall, Hyundai Premium Outlet Gimpo is just an average shopping outlet center, for now."
Nice shopping place,"Don't see much review for this. Anyway, explored it. Pretty big and nice to walk around. The usual international Stores are there - tods, Ferragamo, Tory burch, Burberry, ck, etc.Quite easy to get there from Seoul. A quick subway to Gaehwa station before changing to a taxi or bus (number 16). I took the bus as there wasn't any taxi in sight. About 25 mins to reach there (last stop).There is even a kids club there where you can leave by themselves to play with supervision. Cost only 10000 won for 2 hours. Very clean and safe environment. Best of both worlds."
Very large place!,Hyundai premium outlet in Gimpo was newly opened in 2015. It was a very large place with a lot of shops located. The area was very spacious and clean. The place was comfortable to shop in and there was greeneries being planted around the area.
