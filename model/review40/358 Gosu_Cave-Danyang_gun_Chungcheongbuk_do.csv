Beautiful,This cave is huge takes about 45 mins to walk through. Metal walkway well designed stay on your left. Pretty amazing natural formations. Be careful not to bump your head. 11000 won entry high price but worth it in my opinion.
"Easy tour of a cave, not for the extreme explorers","GOOD POINTS:1. This is for the not-so extreme explorers. The cave has a single entrance-to-exit route. The walk-thru is on metal pathways with safety railings. They have lights, signs and descriptions at each stop.2. The well-designed route and facility is good for groups of children and old people. I can also recommend this for the solo traveller who wants to explore the place alone.3. It’s perfect for a summer trip because the cave is cold inside. Prepare for the Winter though, you might freeze inside. ☃️POINTS TO CONSIDER:1. Wear the right shoes. It can get slippery inside but wearing gum-sole or rubber shoes will solve that problem. Also, you’ll save money by not renting shoes that they offer at the market entrance.2. It can get crowded at certain times of the day. So make way for others when taking pictures or else you’d cause an unnecessary traffic jam.3. This is not for the extreme cave explorers or spelunkers. No crawling, swimming or being covered with mud."
Amazing ,"So interesting. Visited with husband, 5 year old and 2 year old. Wish we’d put 2 year old on sling as a few wriggly moments on slippy steps whilst being carried. Might have been difficult getting through some of the tight spaces however with toddler on back. The barriers aren’t great at times for small children as the gaps between bars acting as a barrier over high drops can be as wide as a child. Amazing rock formations though and well maintained. Staff great. "
"Nice cave, easy access","I visited here while staying with friends. I took the bus from their place. Ok made sure to have it written in Korean, as the buses only have Korean writing. Luckily someone made sure I got on the right bus. The bar area had touristy shipping and other things. The cave is up and down and narrow in some places. They give you gloves at the entrance for security. It's cool but not cold. Took maybe a little under an hour. The return bus stop is at the end of the parking lot towards town. "
A wandering turned worthy!,"Hai all!We, a group of 10 people, went to this cave during winter time (February) in Korea. We didn't have much expectations as we thought this would be an exhausting 940 m walk. But honestly, the walk was worthwhile! Even it's a cave, they've maintained it well. You'll also pass through an informative and playful exhibition center before entering the cave. - Cost of ticket for an adult is 11,000.- They has given proper stairs and guidelines throughout the walk. - Temperature inside the cave is adjusted accordingly.- Those ups, curls and downs never make you feel tired. - The path is exclusively constructed for one person to walk at a time. Sometimes you need to shrink your body to adjust yourself through some tiny pathways. (That gave us an adventurous feel too!). - You'll never feel bored during the exploration as there are various varieties of limestone structures that looks like gorgeous sculptures and make you feel for nature's unending wonders.Go without any expectation. You'll create memories. Happy Caving!"
Overpriced for us,We walked over Oksun Bridge from town and reached the cave in 15 minutes but were put off by the entrance fee which was rather high. Having been in many caves before we decided to give this one a miss and we strolled through the car park which was lined with restaurants and souvenir stalls.
Exceeded expectations ,"We’ve done the cave thing a number of times but we had some time to kill on our last day in town. It is a bit overpriced for a cave at 11000 won a person, but what they have done to make the cave accessible is pretty impressive. You trek back about a kilometre and at one point are up about 5 stories high inside the cave. Cool experience. They’ve made it very safe with walk ways and railings, but it is narrow in spots and requires a lot of ducking. Worth checking out if you have time. It is just over the bridge by the bus station. About a 10 min walk. There are restaurants, shops, and bathrooms by the cave. "
A huge cave bringing lots of visitors,"This is the best and the biggest cave in Danyang-gun. Lots of visitors come to see.- The entrance was 11,000 won which is high for a cave. But, it is not expensive for the experience.- There are free lockers at the entrance.- There's not a risky area and a helmet is not necessary. The only tough part is a spiral steps downwards.- Many kinds of stalactites. Good chance to learn."
Great afternoon visit,"We went on a little side trip to this cave from our camping trip with friends and brought my 6 year old son along. Be warned, you need to be in decent physical condition and not be too big to go through. Im 5'7 and about 190 lbs so there were a few places that were a snug fit through the walkways. Its about 2 kilometers up and down stairs and along narrow platforms. My son was fine but said he was really tired at the end. My bad knee ached but it was Ok and worth the visit. The drive in from Woraksan National Park was beautiful. If you cannot walk and go 2 kilometers without sitting, this is not a good idea."
"Well organized cave walk, go deep!","A ticket gets you grippy gloves and a point in the right direction. Aluminum stairs and platforms wind you in up and down a deep cave, many set spots lit for effect, with Hangul-only descriptions. A little damp, be prepared for some dirt, but very interesting."
Gosu cave,"Pictures of Gosu cave /Kosu Cave . This place was such an Interesting cave. There is a visitor center with a mini museum. It has a fun interactive game, and specimens from the cave. There are snacks available at a vendor outside and decent bathrooms behind the center. It just had a renovation 3/2016. The town is cute and has lots to do for tourists. I wish we had stayed a few days in Danyang. The cave is NOT handicap accessible. Bring a coat, and good walking shoes. They provide gloves but bring your own if you have large hands bc the rails are ice cold. The cave has a few very narrow areas. In one part you will climb a five story spiral staircase. It might bother you if you are clostraphobic and get behind a big tour group. Bring Won . The venders have cute stuff. Parking is limited so carpool if you can. "
Beautiful and not artificial Cave,"CYC ( 2017.03.01 ) My family visited this attraction on our way to another place. I didn't expect this cave, but there was more attractive than I think. There was beautiful and not artificial different with another cave. The cave has been well preserved and had beautiful cave view. When we went deep into the cave, the air condition was not good to me. And because the passage was too narrow, if congested, it was not comfortable."
Easy to visit,"The eleven dollar admission is a bit steep, but the steel walkway that that guides visitors for the two kilometer walk inside the cave system was pretty impressive and probably where lot of the admission money went. The cave system naturally insulated heat and it was actually about ten degrees warmer inside the cave (outside was around 0 degree). The walkways were extremely narrow and there were lot of spots where you have to watch your head. Luckily, this was low season and the walkways weren’t clogged with tourists. Visiting during busy season would not be good for people with claustrophobia. Everyone has to walk through a small museum with information about the cave system and there are explanations in English every 100 meters or so."
"Not the most exciting one, but a fun walk","The walk is pretty long, but all the species mentioned to ""live there"" propably lived there in the time before the metal walkways and railings. After visiting a few caves before this one, wasn't too exciting here. The price 11kW feels a bit too much"
"Family fun, beautiful mountains, friendly people","Today we enjoyed the cooler weather and clean air (81) and headed East to the Mountains of Chungcheong county Korea. With our flaky Korean GPS, an ancient map, Google Earth on our phone, and a little bit of guesswork, we found it. The english GPS goes a little crazy at I55 and I40, so stop at a rest stop and pick up a map. The beautiful mountains, and quaint Korean villages led us to the town of Danyang. A winding river and surrounding green mountains welcomed us with para gliders and waterfalls. We drove over the bridge and arrived at Gosu cave surrounded by a Korean mountain village, snack shops and friendly trinket vendors. I bought two stone planters and we all enjoyed some popsicles. The cave cost around 35,000 won for a family of 4 and they took American Express credit cards. The cave had many formations over 5 stories tall. There was a spiral staircase that followed several formations down. This cave was not for the clostraphobic as you really feel that you are inside a giant crack in the mountain. Most of it involved climbing slippery stairs, ducking, and squeezing around columns of limestone. We enjoyed the privilege of being so close to the formations. My kids really liked it. It was as close as you can get to spelunking without getting dirty. I got a little out of breath at one point. There were safety people at 3 stops within the cave in case someone is in over their head. The attached museum was just updated july 2016 to include microscopes, formations with descriptions, cave animals, Fossils, and an interactive kids computer art screen. After leaving the cave, we found an english brochure that noted many other exciting things to do in Danyang. There are 3 other caves, multiple waterfalls, a buddist shrine, camping sites, hand gliding, an aquarium, ATV rentals, horseback riding, water rafting and canoeing. It was late in the day so we grabbed some soy sauce and garlic fried chicken at Kyochon chicken. We couldn't have asked for a better view. We could see the waterfall and watch the gliders off the mountaintop land at the riverbed. All good things must come to an end. So now it's time to say hello to the sunset and goodby to these majestic mountains on our drive home to Pyeongtaek . I can't wait to come back to this area. "
Amazing walk in underground,"We went yearly at the morning to avoid the crowd. It was pleasant empty, so some parts you can't see other tourists, it's well-lit and maintained, there are descriptions of formations in English, so you can see shape of turtle, dragon, etc.It takes more than hour return trip (1,5 km each way) if you take pictures and read signs. Take extended tour to upper part, it is worthy!"
Closed until July 2016!!!!,Fairly easy to locate but sadly is closed until the end of July 2016. :-( ..... Better luck next time I guess. The good news is there iare pelnty of other sights to see in this beautiful area
Maze of stairs,"What made this cave special was the maze of paths, spiral. zig-zag, and multi-level staircases. All very well constructed. Only a couple parts where you had to squeeze through, so not too claustrophobic. Lots of people and a narrow path so once you're in, there is no turning back. Outside the cave, lots of touristy shops and some food."
Beautiful Cave - interesting tour,"We had three children with us and the ""tour"" was really just a group of people who were pushed together through the cave. At one point we were on our hands and knees crawling (I had to take my day pack off), then we had to climb up a spiral staircase. I had to carry my 3-year old son because he was slipping on the steps. It is an enormous cave and definitely worth the look!"
An amazing place to visit,"I was wowed by my walk through this limestone cave! We visited the cave as part of a USO tour. It was the highlight of the many things we experienced in and around Danyang that day. I thought that Mammoth Cave, Luray Caverns, and other caves in the States were impressive until I visited this incredible cave. The Koreans have made the cave very accessible and easy enough to walk through, as long as you're OK with lots of steps. The natural formations in the cave were incredible and I was in awe of the height and breadth of the chambers there. If you're in Korea for even a week, go walk this cave. You will love it."
Educational cave,"If you learn the earth science, you can confirm that textbook is correct. When I explaned how this cave was made, I felt I was a good father. Cave was little cold in enterance. So yon need a jumper."
Fun cave visit!,"The cave in itself may not be so much different from other caves I've visited (although quite beautiful), the walking part of this visit was the most fun part. This cave has extremely narrow and steep alleys, sometimes forcing visitors to creep and crawl on their knees."
Very beautiful with stalagmites and stalactites. ,"Very beautiful with stalagmites and stalactites. It is limestone cave. It has many beautiful scene indide but you have to go ups and downs, many stairs. You will realse the miracle of the nature. "
Nice place,The visit was good and there are some beautiful stalagmites & stalactites. The walkway is well done and easy to go thru.
Beautiful but Busy Gosu (Kosu) Cave,"Gosu Cave is a relatively expansive cave system, over 5,500 feet of trails if you take both the A and B tours. There are numerous beautiful formations in the cave and the 8000 won price of admission is certainly worth it. The entire self-guided tour is on constructed trails so it is quite accessible. Admittedly, there are some narrow portions and there are some low portions but two of the people in our group were over 6 feet tall (and one had a baby strapped to his chest) and we had no issues. There were only two detractors. First, the cave was relatively busy (even on a weekday, I can't imagine a weekend visit) and there are few places that are wide enough to pass so one slow person keeps everyone moving at a snail's pace. Over a mile walking at a snail's pace becomes a very long time! Second, all of the main formations have no photo signs on them - when you visited primarily to take pictures that is slightly frustrating. Ironically, the vast majority of the Koreans were blatantly ignoring the no photo signs so I didn't feel too bad about ignoring them as well. All things considered, I would definitely recommend a visit to the Gosu Cave if you are in the Danyang area."
Great wet cave,"We walked here from town, it is a very quick walk after the bridge. You will see several stalls on your left as you approach the turn off to the cave. We did the A+B route and it was great 8000 pp. Some parts are narrow but all very doable. The cave is still very much forming, and it drips constantly from the ceiling. The temperature is cool but you don't need a jacket. Great sight if you are passing by the area."
Gosu Caves,"This cave is quite an unique experience for city dwellers, it felt like an adventure meandering through the narrow passages and squatting through certain parts of the low ceiling. The entrance to the cave is after a certain flight of steps, it was very cooling during the entire journey at a constant 15 degree celsius. If you are worried about the cold, you don't really have to as all the climbing and squatting will result in your sweating and heating up. I would say worth a visit if you are in the area. However, would not build an itinery around the cave, it would be more of a since we are here might as well look at it."
Beautiful cave,"We have been in many caves so far but were really impressed by the Gosu cave. It is sometimes narrow but often high rooms with huge stalactite and stalagmite. There are many stairs and steps, perhaps difficult for older people and children. You can choose between A and A+B course. We took the A course, that means you way back is outside of the cave. The A+B course brings you back to the starting point inside the cave, the way back is partly the same way."
Very interesting but not flashy,"Liked the natural look of the cave, without the flashy lights and neon that other Korean caves have. Quite close in the cave so not for the claustrophobic."
Nice cave - worth a visit if you are nearby,"The cave is big, not huge. The formations are nice, but not very vell lit or enhanced. The structure for the walkway seem fairly big in comparison. Some of the passages are low, but a friend of mine who is 202 cm long and weights over 120 kg walked through it all. The walk is however quite a lot up and down on stairs and the temperature was 12 C (outside about 5 C), so don't be overly warmly dressed or you'll end up sweating a lot (like we did)."
Cavern Worth Exploring,"Though suprisingly not well-known, Korea has many excellent caves. Most of these caves are found in Gangwon-do and Cheungcheongbuk-do. Danyang, Samcheok, Taebaek, Yeongwol, and Pyeonchang are all cities that are nearby unique caves.Gosu cave is easily visited from Danyang. Gosu is not huge, but the formations are spectacular. I enjoyed an hour of two of taking in the beautiful stalagmites found here. Besides the caves, Danyang itself is an attractive small city with plenty of activities to keep yourself occupied."
