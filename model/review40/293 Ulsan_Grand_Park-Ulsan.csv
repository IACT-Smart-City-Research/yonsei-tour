Nice park ,Nice huge park with lots of activities and flower lightings at night. Lots of buses for transport. Well connected

Great place for an afternoon outing with the family.,"Large expansive park in the middle of Ulsan. You can walk, rent a bike or lounge around. Gardens, playgrounds - even a outdoor military aviation mini-museum and monument."
Amazing park,"Our visit was on a very warm day so lots of water and sunscreen needed. The park is huge - the largest urban park in South Korea nearly 4 square kilometres in area. There is a rose garden, small zoo, walking trails very well used by locals, a water play area. Bicycle hire is available at a reasonable rate.Allow a few hours for a good look around and maybe take a picnic lunch."

Lots of different roses and flowers to see. "
Very relaxing place,It's a huge park with many facilities. There are cafetaria and several automatic drink vending machine too. Very nice to spent the day to relaxing here.
Awesome place,Had been to this place. Its beautiful and huge park. Should hire a bicycle to go around as distance to walk wil b 5 kms from one end to other. Very well maintained. Love u South Korea... ♥️ 
Rose Festival,If you want to visit Ulsan Grand park then I recommend you to visit it during Rose Festival. Normally start from the End of May and Continues to the 1st and 2nd week of June. Another time to visit Grand park in on New Year Eve. It's worth to note that Grand Really Looks Grand on New Year Eve. HAHA
Active family weekend,"The place to visit at any season with good landscape and option of activities such as tracking, kid's playground or sport activity. The interested and attractive flower garden and butterfly space."
Perfect for kids,"This place is full on weekends and a perfect gateaway for children and families.Their is lake, fountain, windmill etc."
A busy park for the whole family!,"Ulsan Grand Park is the place for the family and you can tell simply by going there on the weekends. Dues to the fact that it is located near a densely populated area of Ulsan, it is teaming with families on the weekends. Also because of the fact there is something for pretty much everyone, it is usually quite busy. However, if you plan to go out for a peaceful walk, weekday mornings are your best bet. Typically, weekend afternoons and holidays like Children's Day (May 5th) are times that you really just need to avoid. This is the one place where families love to take their kids and let them blow off a bit of steam. Other than that, it is a great place for a hike or a bike in the mornings or an evening stroll. There are also many other attractions including the zoo, swimming pool, butterfly exhibit and war memorial. Not to mention there is also a Popeye's Chicken there."
"Peaceful, Relaxing & A Must See!","We come here every year when in Ulsan. It's like taking a short trip away from the city into the country. They have beautiful lakes, fountains, small waterfall, a windmill, and the Ulsan Grand Bell along with a beautiful eat memorial. You can rent bikes their for short money per hr. They have an exercise area, bike paths and pleny of benches if you just want to relax and listen to the sounds of nature. This is a Must try when in Ulsan. Weekends can be a little busy and crowded. Enjoy!"
"wonderful on weekdays, Do not go during weekend","I go to the Ulsan Grand Park on weekdays with my 5 year old son.It's so quiet and the playground is amazing and it's all yours :)but during the weekend, it's full of people. If you want to have relax weekend, don't go there"
Nice for a day out,Nice park in the middle of Ulsan. Takes about 2 hours to walk around and you can hire bikes to cycle if you wish. Few coffee shops near the park and sometimes they light up some of the features at night with fairy lights.
Ulsan Grand Park,Nice clean and green open space in Ulsan complete with restaurants swimming pool and butterfly house. It can get busy at weekends so if going there at this time go early.
Nice plays to spend a day,The park is quite nice and really huge. In order to explore the whole park you would need many hours. It is possible to rent a bike in order to get around faster. Many nice places for a picnic. 
big area to get some sweat on winter seassons,"on my trip to south korea, i was going to ulsan to do some field trip. and im stay on the central city of Ulsan and get free time after study class. i spend my time to gettin some landmark of the Ulsan city. the front desk officer was ask me to go to Ulsan Grand Park by bus. and finally i found the landmark of Ulsan city, on this grand park we can jogging, cycling or playin with our child on playground park. i found the wind mill in here, its great to capture it on the front gate. wind mill located on side of park water lake. and it will be goin new year party 2016 on here. after im goin arround i found the great monuments of ulsan city with wall of heroes.. thats was feel great nation patriotics. i suggest before u go inside the grandpark on the winter seassons, u most stop on cafe to get some hot drink. because its cold."
Big but unmemorable,"If you're in Ulsan with nothing to do, this park is a great way to pass a day. But, well, if your time is short or you're thinking of making a trip to Ulsan just to see it, don't bother -- it's just a giant park. "
Relaxing and tranquil ,"One of my favourite spots in Ulsan. Loads or paved or off-road walking routes with bike hire, swimming pool, rose garden, butterfly house and zoo all thrown in. Large complex. Beautiful. "
Very calm and harmonic place packed up with screaming kids.,Great place that we visit with the family every time we travel from Geoje to Ulsan. Very calm and harmonic place although packed up with screaming kids.
Beautiful park,"nice park,with a lot of possibilities!Take your own food and enjoy in the grass!U can even take outFood!the kids loved it!Everything is possible in Korea,if u have the language!Splash pad forSummer time;)"
A huge park with plenty of facilities for all ages,"This is a huge park with lots to do for both young and old, and has many entrances. It is so big that there is a little open air bus which you can hop on and off, together with a facility to hire bikes. The first thing you notice is how clean it all is. There is noooo litter whatsoever, anywhere. I dropped a magazine the other week and didn't realize. When I retraced my steps, the magazine had already been put in the bin. It also houses a War Memorial to the fallen of the Korean War, and aeroplanes and tanks, a beautiful Pagoda, a Windmill, waterfalls and fountains, vending machines and cafes.There are quiet areas with plenty of space to sit on the grass and relax, as well as covered areas to sit and have a picnic (as the Koreans avoid the sun at all costs).For children, they have a huge area with a bouncy area which looks lime a snowy mountain, which covers a big area. A little village, with roads and traffic lights they ride around in little cars, a petting zoo and a swimming pool arena, which you can swim for free at certain times of the week. I am told but not certain that this is during the week after 12 noon and all weekend, but you would need to check on ulsanonline to confirm this, a website I have found invaluable since living here for all things that Ulsanites may need. There is lots of paid for parking and you can easily spend all day here, as we have on many a weekend. A must destination if living in Ulsan especially if you have children."
Family Day at Ulsan Grand Park,"We have been visiting this Park for close on three years now and every time we go the kids really enjoy it. There are three main entrances to this massive park area but we usually have been going to the entrance closest to the big bouncy trampolines and butterfly enclosure.It is a bit further to travel though.The park is ideal for walking, sports and push bike riding, which you can hire if required or just having a quiet picnic. For those not so athletic there is a shuttle bus service which can move you around.Use this link to my YouTube channel to get RobsSkyviewz from above and around this great park.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aivlQhado8YGet there early is best, pay as you go parking and plenty of refreshments available.Trampoline opens at 12.00 in the winter, other wise 10.00 am.Enjoy."
Excellent,The park is very nice with the electric train and a lot of play garden for children. Parking is toll and there are some shop inside for food and beverage. Is possible to have some excursions on the mountain or at the zoo. 
Enjoy and relax,The Grand Park is excellent for a Sunday picnic. Take your bike out for a spin and stop at the Grand park for a coffee or just look at the people here. In the end of the park there is a buttefly park as well.
Beautiful Park,We stopped by here for just a few minutes. It was a weekday so there weren't a lot of people and the atmosphere was very relaxing. I wish we had some more time to explore but we were impressed by what we did see. The park appeared to be well constructed and well taken care off. There also seemed to be several attractions in the park and in nearby areas to keep one busy for quite a while.
A nice park in the heart of Ulsan,"This was always a weekend favorite while in SOuth Korea. Basketball, festivals, walking, picnic, gym. Enjoy this beautiful park!"
Beautiful park with something for everyone,Grand park is great for a walk. There are bikes to rent and even is less known about war memorial tucked into a corner near the middle of the park. The flowers and trees are beautiful in the spring and summer months. It is great for picnics and many areas for children of all ages to play. 
Nice place to spend an afternoon,"It quite a nice and large park. Not a huge amount of things to do, but still nice. We rented a bike which was fun, but make sure you check the bike well because some of them are ready to fall apart. We also went into the butterfly conservatory, the building was cool but we didn't see any butterflies at all. Maybe it was the time of year. Not sure. Overall, if the weather is nice and you're bored in Ulsan, check out the park."
Beautiful!,"Ulsan Grand Park is an amazing park right near the heart of the city. You can rent a bike for about 6000 won and enjoy it from start to finish. There are tons of play areas for kids, a memorial and beautiful gardens. It is really huge though, so make sure you set aside some time to see it all. I really love this park and think its a great way to spend the day with your family or partner. Have a picnic, let the kids play or enjoy a tandem bike ride. As the title says: beautiful!"
"wow, what a nice place to go for a walk","what a great park, you got to go see it, rent a bike or just stroll down the paths, it is centrally located so you can take a bus or just drive and plenty of parking (about 1000 KWON or a dollar), remember, up the hill is the Ulsan Museum. "
Great for family outing.,"Large park near the city centre. Lovely countryside, lakes and small attractions for children. Very busy at weekends, but not really a problem as park is so big. Nice place for a walk around, a picnic, or just to hang out for the day."
Excellent place for a day long outing,"Visited Ulsan Grand Park and it is an awesome place. Maintained very well. Well thought thru in terms of its design and features. One of the interesting aspect which I liked is a walkway near the lake which is planned to touch all the 32 areas in the feet, similar to foot reflexology. "
Nice place to spend a day,"It's a very large park, good for running, biking and what not. You can even rent a bike from the park. There are also a lot of thinks for kids to do."
Great Park for walking and cycling,"This is a great park for walking or cycling through. You can hire bikes at the main entrance quite cheaply. One and a half hours is probably enough to give you time for stops and breaks. There is a little bit of a climb halfway round but nothing too strenuous. There is a picturesque lake with a windmill, several childrens' play areas and even a mini orad system for child cyclists to learn their highway code. All in all, a great place to spend a few hours surrounded by nature."
Where everyone goes at the weekend.,"We took a bike ride here, as we live on the other side of the river, and wished to miss the traffic jam.Quite a large area, easily found on the map, but not so until you actually come near to it.As soon as we came near to one of the entrances, it seemed like most of Ulsan had decided to come here to. Lots of food sale wagons and such on the outside, before walking/riding through the entrance to a mass of leisurely activities for families, or just a stroll through the park.Lovely to see so many families enjoying their weekend together, and others just coming to be away from the traffic and noise of the city."
My First Visit,"I have just moved to Ulsan, S. Korea and was taken to this gem of a park on my first day here. It is a 10 minute walk from my apartment and it's a place my dog and I will be spending a lot of time. There are plenty of attractions within the park and plenty of wide open spaces to stroll or sit by a fountain. There are several ""waterfall"" areas that were dry so I don't know if their water level is determined by rainfall or if water was shut off to the areas for the winter. Trees are beginning to blossom and on Saturday there were many, many, families out walking and riding bikes. I believe the park could accommodate the city's population and still not feel crowded. Perfect for a stroll or a run...but I'm a stroller!Bike rental is available...I believe about $10 US for the day."
Very large and misterious,I've been in this park 3 times already it is very large has lot of different playgrounds and it is soo large that I have never been able to know it all. All maps and websites I've found are in korean there are pictures of a large swimming pool pet zoo hopefully someday I will be lucky enought to take my kids out of one this playgrounds to get to learn it all. There is an internal bus service
Many things to do here!,I visited this park many times in 2011-2012. There are a ton of activities and events held here. You can rent bikes and there is also a community pool. The flower garden was amazing last spring. Check it out if they do it again this year. Childrens day is also a great time to bring out the little ones. The park is great for picnics in the summer time Also check out the lights during the Christmas holiday season.
