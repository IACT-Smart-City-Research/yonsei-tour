Interesting Story behind the place itself,"This place is located on top of a hill and is one of the places where the King Taejo celebrated his victory against Japanese invaders.It needs a short walk from Jeonju Village.It's on the way for (Jaman Mural Village).I went there in august, in a really hot day, and was very pleasant take a little rest under the pavillion.From here where you can look down the Hanok village, but I think it's not the best view on the Village."
Worth climbing the stairs! ,Situated on the hill accessible via Hanok village. Beautiful views over Hanok village. Serene surroundings with the tall trees. Worth climbing the hill. 
Nice shrine area & views over hanok village ,"It's an easy walk from the main entrance to the hanok village up the main round & see a slope to the right, follow this & the wooden stair case to the open area with Omokdae shrine pavilion. Follow the wooden stairs & walk ways from the area to find great views over the hanok village roof tops. Take the bridge over the road to the other side for the Imokdae area"
High place of Jeonju Hanok Village,"Try to reach Omokdae and feel relax in the gazebo, by hiking a little while and get a full landscape of Jeonju."
Hilltop sites,"These two locations are next to one another on a hill top close to the centre of Jeonju. The walk up is a short, fairly steep climb, not too difficult. Good vies of the Hanok village can be had on the climb. Worth a short detour to see the views."
Nice short walk above Jeonju hanok village,"We walked uphill from Jeonju hanok village to visit Omokdae and Imokdae. The pavilions are both beautiful, but we were expecting better views after reading the reviews. There wasn't any view of the hanok village from either of the pavilions, instead there's a partial view from the path up the hill to Omokdae. Nice to visit if you have lots of time, but certainly not a must-see."
Beautiful during autumn,"It is situated on a little hill that overlooks the Hanok Village...A historical site where first Joseon King celebrated his victory over the Japanese...During fall, beautiful leaves compliment the two site very well...lots of beautiful photos can be taken here."
Pit-stop for your Jaman Mural Village tour,"Built in memory for Yi Seong-gye, the first King of the Joseon Dynasty. Between the Jaman Mural village and Hanok Village, this is a good go-between linking the 2.Omokdae features a pavillion and is elevated across the Mural village, offering good views and a good stop to rest."
View of Jeonju Hanok,You can step on a small hill ^^ to see the view of Jeonju hanok. You can spend the time for ralaxing at here.
In memory of a historical event.,"Not far from the Hanok Village on top of a small hill is the sight known as Omokdae, it is here that Yi Seong-gye, who would become the first King of the Joseon Dynasty (1392-1897), stayed after a victorious win against Japanese pirates at Hwangsan. A stunning open-sided pavilion monument was erected in 1900 to remember the event. The sight is free to visit. From the Hanok Village there is a small climb up a hill then a set of stairs to arrive at the pavilion. On the day of our visit we were the only foreigners there when several young Korean school children out on a day excursion came over to us keen to practice their English with us. We have a fond memory of this experience.From the top of this hill there are glimpses over the rooftops of neighbouring Hanok villages through the scattered trees."
Good view,It is at the backside of jeonju hanook village. There are many way to go up when you arrive it is open air ground. Good spot to see all the hanook village area from the top. Especially when it snow. Great to drop by.
Colourful pavilion ,"Located across the road from the mural village, this pavilion has a large seating deck below a colourful ornately decorated roof. Thanks for the vote if you found this review helpful."
The scenery is more impressive than the monuments,"There isn't too much to see at both sites, and both require a hike to get to. However they offer views of the city that are quite splendid."
Nice views on the short walk up,"Located on top of a small hill, it is nice to take in the view of the Hanok village from above. Come this way and make your way along further to view the mural village."
Peaceful feel with 15 mins slow climb,"Conquer a long flights of stairs to reached this place. There is no shortcut to it.Climb with an elderly, so we do it really slowly like for a 15 mins climb.It's the peaceful feel that we can get reaching here.Stayed for around 30 mins at this area, drinking tea and admiring the beauty of Jeonju."
beautiful view of Hanok Village,"to get up there you need to climb some stairs, but the view up there is worth it! i heard it is even better at night, shame i didn't have the time!"
Magnificent view after a short climb,"Omokdae and Imokdae are located within a stone's throw away from the Hanok village. Just a short climb of stairs will get you to Omokdae first, which offers a stunning view of Jeonju's hanok village. We also stumbled by a 100-year old cafe at the foot of Omokdae! Very impressed with the history of the city here. "
Get ready with your hiking shoes...,"This attraction involves lots of walking, hiking and climbing up and going down stairs...if you're up to the challenge, there's a good site of the Hanok Village from here..."
A bit of walking needed,Do wear shoes that are not slippery as if it rain some areas are a bit hard to walk . Some stairs needed to be climbed here 
Nice view over Jeonju Hanok Village,"A little hike up and away from the Jeonju Hanok Village, you will be rewarded with the nice view over the traditional house dotted downhill. "
nice view of the village,"its worth a walk.. if you reach it via the trails its a little bit like sentosa trails. but you can see nive views of jeonju as you walk up. just when you feel abit stretched you will have arrive at the top n there's is their korea pavilion for you to sit n relax among this secluded clearing... you need to remove your shoes though.while catching your breath sitting down, you can start to imagine scholars, poets having literary conversation or pondering thoughts. its kinda of amazing how this place can easily transport you back in time. "
Nice stroll ,A short walk leads you to the top of the hill with nice views of the village. It doesn't take long and is fairly easy. Night time allows for some pretty views! Seemed very safe even at night!
An Interesting Story Behind These Attractions,"We visited Omokdae and Imokdae recently and learned the story behind these two structures. It was interesting to see how each of these came to be. They help reflect a part of the very interesting history of Korea. Next to these attractions are signage that explains, in English, why these structures exist. Take a few minutes while you're in Jeonju Hanok Village to visit these sights."
Murals village ,U can see murals when u walking there.many cute drawings in the street.So u must walk by 이목대
The hills were VERY steep,We went hiking around the area and the climbing was straight up. We got some good views and the exercise was good. It was difficult (without reading Korean) to follow the maps (and a bit frustrating).
Hanok Village look from the peak~,"You have to walk some stairs up to the Omokdae but once you reach the peak, all the hard work is worth-ed it. You can watch the whole hanok village from here which is really pretty. Imokdae is the other side from Omokdae, Just ask around if you can't find it. People here are really friendly."
Awesome Jeonju Hanok Village View from Omokdae,"We hiked up Omokdae and from the hill you can view the awesome sight of Jeonju Hanok Village below. Definitely worth it. At Omokdae there is a really nice pavilion. Take a rest and enjoy the scenery there.As for Imokdae, it was rather lackluster. Forgettable. Can be skipped."
City Hiking with Culture,"In easy reach of the Hanok Village, these monuments from the Joseon Dynasty involve a bit of hiking, but are free and worth the effort! Two more reasons to visit Jeonju! Spring and fall are the best times!"
