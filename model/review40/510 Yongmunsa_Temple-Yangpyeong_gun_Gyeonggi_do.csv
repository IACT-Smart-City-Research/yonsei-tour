"Pretty commercialized. But, still beautiful.","This is a temple in Yongmunsan Mountain. Unlike other temples, this is very commercialized like a tourist site. But, the trail to the temple is really peaceful and it has an amazing ginkgo tree. Good for a day trip from Seoul especially during fall foliage season.- This temple is accessible through Yongmunsan Tourist Site. So, visitors have to buy tickets(2,500 won). The front gate is about 15 min walk from ticket office and the main temple is 30~40 min walk from the front gate.- The way to the main temple area is a chance to feel the nature and quite peaceful.- When we visited in early November, the fall foliage was in the middle of season. Really beautiful with yellow and red colors.- Main temple area is not that small nor that extensive. It doesn't take much time to look around. But, the old ginkgo tree which is more famous than the temple is must-see.- Not many hills nor stairs. Beloved by many seniors and entrance is free for them.- There were very few foreign visitors."
Small Temple,"We paid the parking and entrance fees then walked up 2km to the temple. But when we were there, most of the temple buildings were locked so we could not get it. It was not worth to pay full fees for seeing the famous ginko tree and seeing the temple exterior. Maybe the temple stay and hiking there are good. But there are many more wonderful buddhist temples and mountains in/out Seoul free of charge."
"Nice walk, quiet woodland.","Can be accessed easily in a day trip from Seoul, train then bus, although the bus stop is a short walk from the train station. The bus stops a short walk from the temple, you could follow the road but we took a nicer route through the wood. Walking through the wood there are lots of little things to stumble upon, such as view points and stones, there were also almost no other people. You approach the temple from above give a nice discovery feeling. Not as impressive a walk or a temple as some located closer to Seoul but a good option if you want a day away from the city. There are some eateries around the bus stop and a nice tea house by the temple."

Pretty Area,"Its a little bit of a walk from the parking lot to the temple. Along the way the scenery is real pretty. There is a stream flowing along the path & makes for some nice photos. It's a typical Korean/Asian temple, very colorful. "
"Cosy temple with fresh air, beautiful mountain view.","C1 ( 2013.3.29 )This Yongmunsa Temple was located in Yongmun mountain's tourist resort complex. In entrance of this complex, there was a many Korean traditional food store. this food were very delicious. Yongmunsa Temple was apart from complex entrance about 1 KM. The road to temple was very beautiful with a shallow stream sound. The temple's mood was very calm and good. The temple's building and scenery of mountain was harmonious. I didn'nt know why I feel at peace whenever I visited temple in mountain. There was gingko standing during thousand year. If you want to heal heart, I recommand any temple in Korea mountain."
