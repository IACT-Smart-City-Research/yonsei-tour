Southern Gate,"Paldalmun Gate is the southern gate to Suwon's Hwaseong Fortress. It is not connected to the rest of the fort but is located on an Island in the road. An impressive gateway, surrounded by modern buildings."
Just a gate surrounded by modern buildings,"Paldalmun isn't connected to the fortress, but is rather an isolated gate surrounded by modern buildings. It might make for a nice photo, but I wouldn't recommend going out of your way to visit it. Rather, go to the fortress through some of the other gates."
Nice contrast between old and modern,"My favourite of the gates of Suwon, because of the contrast between the old gate and the busy road and the market in the streets next to it."
Southern gate of Suwon Hwaseong Fortress,"Locating in downtown, this has been isolated by roads after the long period of time.It's good to take a look and learn architecture. But, access is not allowed.- It feels very similar to Namdaemun(Sungnyemun) Gate of Seoul.- Paldalmun isn't the main gate. Janganmun in north is. Because the king visited from the north.- From this, you can go to Hanggung-dong Street or Nammun Market(market complex)."
Paldalmun,This is one of the most amazing places to see in Suwon. It is on unesco world heritage list and also you can enjoy shopping in the bazaar around there.
Good for hiking too,"You can get a nice view of wall during night time, and have a walk from the gate and just follow the wall...you'll see more natural attractions. Very pretty when it snows...recommended for night hiking."
The main gate of the city walls - a great starting point,"We came here right from the Suwon train station using a taxi we found just outside. It was only around 15 minutes away and just outside the gate are good coffee shops you can warm up in. Around the gates are good walking grounds that you can wander about with nice seating just outside the city walls. Above the gate, is where you can start your journey to see all the city walls."
Good starting point for a walk around Suwon city wall,"We walked the length of Suwon city wall, starting and ending at Paldalmun. It's a great starting point because it's such an obvious landmark, and there's a taxi stand right next to the gate so it's easy to get back to the train station afterwards.The gate is huge & impressive, really beautiful. It's in the middle of a busy roundabout so it's hard to get a good photo. There's no pedestrian crossing to get to the wall in the centre of the roundabout, so there's no easy way to get up close to it."
Cannot walk through it,"The newly restored Paldalmun Gate, the southern gate of the Hwaseong Fortress is one of the symbols of the city and takes up the center of a roundabout in the middle of a busy area of the city. Unfortunately, you cannot walk through the gate as the center area is not pedestrian accessible. Near the gate is a traditional market and the Paldalsa Temple which are worth a quick look around."
In the middle of the houses,"Impressive as it is so close to the houses but you can just look around (quite close to the walls, not easy to take a picture of the whole gate)"
Bus stop marker for Hwaseong Fortress Wall,"Honestly, this structure was my marker where to get on/off the bus to/from Suwon Station. Other than that, it looks the same gate as those that can be found in Seoul."
In the middle of a busy roundabout,Our guest house was just a few minutes walk from Paldalmun Gate which is in the middle of a busy roundabout. It is better viewed from the north side as there is more to see. It is the only gate that is separated from the wall because it was reconstructed in the busy part of the city. By the gate are the names of all the people involved in its construction.
South gate,"Having traveled down from Seoul on the metro we walked from the train station in the direction of the Hwaseong Fortress (thirty minutes), the first glimpse that we were in the vicinity of the fortress was arriving at the impressive Paldalmun Gate (South Gate). The gate is located in the middle of a very small round-about not easily accessed, not that we needed to anyway. Construction of the gate began in 1794 and is listed as a National Treasure, #402."
Impressive,This is the southern gate to the fort complex and is quite impressive due to it's size.Very well preserved.
Pladalmun and Traditional Market,Nice historical place with cultural value. Nice palce to try traditional food in traditional market about 100 meter. chicken street and foodtruck
Impressive traditional architecture,This gate stands in the middle of very busy traffic with a result that we could only see it from the outside but it is very impressive and a sharp contrast to the modernity of the city in general.
One of Main Gate that is near Traditional Korean Market for over 200 years!!!,"You will meet Paldalmun Gate as the first gate when you come from Suwon Station. It's one of the main gate of Suwon Hwaseong Fortress which located near the Traditional Korean Market for over 200 years!!! This market is ""Paldalmun Market"". It's a very big market that have hundreds of shops which include food, fruits, vegetables, fresh products, Hanbok, cloths, accessories, etc. Enjoy shopping !"
One of the great sections of the fortress,The Paldalmun Gate is one of the more spectacular sections of the Hwaseong Fortress in Suwon. Check it out on a rare day of blue skies.
Unable to enter through the gate,A beautiful entrance to the city but closed to tourists. The steps that lead up to the wall on the right offers a great view of the gate and its imposing presence. Rightfully designated as a World Heritage site
good market,This is a nice palce with nice traditional market. you can taste traditional food too. nice place to hangout
Epic 18th century Joseon dynasty fortress beautifully built and documented construction historical heritage.,"If you have a chance to read the story behind the construction of Hwaseong fortress and Haengung by King Jeongjo and his heartfelt love to his father and mother, you will appreciate this UNESCO World Heritage."
Grand start to exploring Suwon,Catch bus 11 13 36 or 39 from the train station and alight here and this dominating structure. High walled and colourful roof top. Sadly unable to enter but still great to admire from afar. Visitors centre located on the west side.Thanks for the vote if you found this review helpful.
Good Picture stop!,This is one of the several stops along the Suwon fortress. When I am there the left side of Paldalmun is under renovation. That does affect the pictures you take but can easily been overcome.
Right Thing Wrong Place,"Having something like this on a traffic island is not ideal and crossing a road in South Korea is never easy ,but good for photos."
I could enjoy the market area next to this gate.,This gate is on the big traffic road and I could just see at distance. It's beautiful but the good thing is to have a fun at huge traditional market area. There're lots of food stores and shops selling cheap clothes.
Gate,This is one of the main gates leading to the fortress. Have so much history in it. Nice spot for pictures
weekend visit,Must see on your tour of Suwon. It is part of the Fortress. Bring your walking shoes. Plan for a full day trip.
The Big gate,"The Paldal-mun (Paldal Gate) is the largest gate for the Suwon fortress. If you are meeting someone in Suwon, this is the largest most recognizable landmark in town. It is also the best day hike for people who like historical landmarks. Take an English-speaking guide or bring a guidebook for every step of the fortress. You won't regret this visit."
History and shopping,"The Paldalmun gate sits in the midst of a vibrant and bustling market. Visitors can examine Joseon dynasty architecture, take photos of what is one of the more attractive of the fortress gates of Suwon, and view the surroundings from the walls.And then descend and explore the market area. Bargains of all kinds rub shoulders with fashion items, and there are the food shops and street vendors.A great two or three hour excursion."
Local market ,"It is local market where you can find all the household items at reasonable prices. Shoes, Purses, Clothes are available with very cheap price.. Donuts are very famous here and can be try."
I recommend a stroll along the wall,There are nice views from the top of the wall and the Gate is beautiful. It was a nice walk from the fort.
Good place for marketing,"One of the entry gates of the fortress in Suwon, its main attraction is the market. Paldalmun market is a really good place to buy all sorts of goods of really good quality at much affordable prices. You can buy all sorts of things from souveneirs to eatables to clothes, shoes, bags, cosmetics etc.Also, the gate is lit with lights in the evening offering a picturesque view of the gate."
Integration of old and new Suwon city,"This is a good place to start your Hwaseong Fortress tour if you want to walk the entire loop. If you want to walk about half the loop, start on the opposite side and finish your walk here as there is a taxi queue nearby."
Nice...but,"This is a nice start to the walk on the wall as the markets are right by...But, the gate itself is integrated into the round about so photos aren't very impressive (unless you want cars in them)More of a sight to see but not really appreciate."
A Treasure to look at ,This area is been revamped from the old suburb it use to be..It is very heritage now with a lot of things to see with some great veiws.
"A weekend eve getaway in Suwon, South Korea.","Keeping short...at this place...one can trek along the wall, surrounded a by market....u can find groceries, clothing & accessories, souvenirs, small electronics, mobiles and food (cooked & to-be-cooked) in abundance."
Nice shopping place walkable from suwon,Nice shopping place near suwon city. Good place to buy small things for home. Jackets shirts ladies dress purses watches etc.
Recently renovated...,"Beautiful photo op. Not much else to see, but there is a good traditional market nearby as well as Hwasong Fortress."
Good Traditional Korean Market,The Paldalmun Gate is one of the gate for suwon palace. It is surrounded by many traditional korean shops. This place is crowded and you got to get some of the cheap stuff. Good value for money stuff.
A big gate and the place to start out from to see the rest of the Fortress.,"The ""Paldalmun Gate"" is the southern gate of the historic Suwon Hwaseong Fortress, designated National Treasure No. 402. A crescent shaped 'ongseong' (defensive secondary wall to prevent the main gate from being broken down with logs) is built on the outside of the door. On the right wall of the gate is a nameplate which contains the names of the people involved in the construction of the gate. The Paldalmun Gate is unique in that it is separated from the rest of the gates, and located in the middle of the busy city... A bit odd as it is basically in the middle of a roundabout on a main road next to a line of bus stops! For this reason I have only given it an Average rating although it is worth a quick visit. The rest of the Suwon Fortress though is very impress and I suggest from this gate head West, buy a ticket (KW1000) and walk the fortress walls all the way round to the Hwahongmun Watergate in the North. This will take about 1.5 hours."
Impressive,"The gate is impressive, although congested with traffic, so not perfect. Lots of shopping around the gate, especially street vendors."
Roundabout,It's almost impossible to appreciate it properly. The gate works like a roundabout in an area with lots of traffic. It's in the middle of the road. You have to take a look from the sidewalk. There is no other way.
Great place to shop for gifts & souvenirs in Suwon,"This place was recommended by the staff at Ibis Hotel when we asked for a shopping destination similar to Nam Dae Mun in Seoul. It's a market of sorts with many shops selling foodstuff, gifts, souvenirs, clothes, shoes, etc. basically a smaller version of Nam Dae Mun.If it's branded stuff, the head for The Galleria, but for a local flavour and lower prices, this is the place to go."
