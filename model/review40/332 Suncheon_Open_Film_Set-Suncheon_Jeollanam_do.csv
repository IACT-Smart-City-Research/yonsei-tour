Not that much to see,It looks like people just come here to take pictures and maybe rent one of the costumes available. Not of much interest
Houses on top of hill,The view of the houses on top of the hill is the highlight of this place. Otherwise give it a miss.Not worth to come here specially 
 Fun spot for a photoshoot,"Suncheon Open Film Set is where a number of Korean dramas and films were shot and has become Suncheon’s most famous tourist attraction. While not even comparable to say Universal Studios set, it is one of the bigger film sets in the country. There are basically three areas in the set: 1980’s Seoul suburb which has a movie theater as it’s centerpiece, 1940’s-1950’s Korea that served as a backdrop for the Japanese Occupation era and Korea immediately after the Korean War, and a hillside slum which is probably the most popular photo spot. Visitors can rent led high school uniforms to enhance their photo shoots. Lot of the buildings have not been maintained well, but most will still serve its purpose as a photo backdrop. Unless joining the groups of couples and high school girls doing photo shoots, it won’t take long to look around."
Live to be a kung fu hero,"An amazing place, which brings your favourite Korean films back to life! Fun, activities and photo opportunities for everyone!"
Small Town Surprise,"It's not somewhere I would spend more than a couple of hours, but it was really nice to see something so close by and something so interesting. You can walk around and see whatever you like, the brave can dress up in outfits for photos. "
Explore this filming set with Korean school uniform!,I enjoyed wearing the old school uniform to walk around this area. It is more fun when you come here with a group of friends because there are many spots to take photos. I saw many Koreans rent the school uniform and they seemed to have a lot of fun too! Highly recommended if you want a special experience in Korea.
A great drama set location in Suncheon,"This is a shooting location for so many famous korea TV drama and movies. Visiting this place, you can image how Korea was in the 60s, 70s, 80s centuries. Here is so beautiful with the vintage background. You can rent 70s 80s student uniforms, 2,500W for 50 mins then walk around and take photos. There's also one disco room with retro music. And I had so much fun there with my friendsThere are some food store here with 80s style. Its really great.Admission fee: 3,000W if you go there alone and 2,500W for 1 person if you come with group more than 20 people. Parking fees: 250W~1,500W (depends on what kind of vehicle)"
We enjoyed our time here!! ,"Here you can enjoy the 60s, 70s and 80s era of Korea this open film set had more than 250building and still used until now. Here you can rent korean old school uniform while exploring the village as cheap as 2500krw for 50 min must visit place when you come to suncheon "
Best thing: old uniform experiences,"This place can bring you to the 1970s Korea. The price of renting the uniform is only 2800 won for 50 minutes, which is really worthy to try"
School time again ˆˆ,"Lots of K-dramas and movies are filmed here like East of Eden, Baking Kim- Kim Tak-ku, Running Man). It consits of three villages each representing a different era from the 1950s to the 1970s. It has approximately 200 houses and is the largest film set in Korea. You can also rent school uniforms and take so many interesting pictures with friends here.You have to pay 2500원 for 50mins uniform rental ~1000원 for accessories like cap and scarf~"
A Travel in time~♡,"One of the things I was the most excited about my trip to Suncheon was being able to wear old school uniforms and be on a big set where programs like the ones I looooove (running man) have been filmed!!!! this place is great for taking picts that will remain in your memories.. and if you are into kdramas, kmovies or variety programs! You gotta come and see it with your eyes! Also is good to have a close look at the korean culture back in the 50's~70's.!!!! Definitely a MUST experience you have to do while in suncheon! Btw... Just 2,500₩ (2$) for the uniform (50min use) and if you want to add some accessories (like a hat) just 1,000₩ each!!!! (Less than 1$)"
Interesting experience - Live in the 60s,An interesting place to visit in Suncheon. You can rent the uniforms at 2500 won for 50 minutes and accessories (caps and scarfs) at 1000 won. I recommend this place for you to take many nostalgic pictures. It’s one of the filming locations for Song Joong Ki’s and Park Bo Young‘s drama - A werewolf boy.
A new kind of thrill,"Korea promotes their culture a lot so most people just know about the hanbok experiences, but in suncheon, you can wear the old school uniforms and experience korea in the 60/70s. Must do: rent uniformsIt's just $2.5 to rent the uniform for 50mins and an extra $1 for accessories like caps and scarfs. More than enough to explore all the old houses and disco recreations hehe. Must try: the street food made with the old recipes. "
Not so interesting if you are not into Korean Movies,"Due to the fact, that we are not at all into korean film/movie it was not so interesting for us. But still some „how it might have looked like“ sceneries available"
Loved it to see seniors becoming young,"This is a drama set implementing Suncheon of 1960s and Seoul of 1970s.It's really fun to experience old times and watching reactions of old visitors.- There are slum town on the hill, photo studio, movie theater, pubs, carpenter's shop, comics shop, etc.- School costume rental as the first visit is recommended.- Slum town is to climb up risky a bit. Seniors over 70s need to be careful.- Entrance is just 3,000 won. Seniors with 65+ are free. Other attractions aren't inclusive. But, watching around without them is okay.- Dancing seniors in the disco house are fun.- Took bus #77 to reach from Suncheon Station. And 15~20 min walk after getting off the bus. There were frequent signs and it's easy to find direction."
Pretty but not very well maintained,"The place is great for photo ops, it really replicates Korea from the 70s and 80s. It’s the perfect place to visit for movie buffs as the sets are the same ones used in many korean movies! You can even rent old school uniforms to have your own photoshoot, as what many locals did. However, there’s nothing much apart from that and the place was not really well maintained. If you’re going there just for photos, you will love it! "
Good for photo,This is the placethat they used to shooting the movies and drama even right now still somehow. The admission fee is just a few and you can rent the student dress in old time for take photo around also. 
Best for k-drama fans,"It was slightly smaller than we thought. Not being k-drama fans, the place was as good as another old film set. The area needs some cleaning up as the prop houses are dusty and unkempt. However, you'll still have nice photos with the film sets as background."
Nice afternoon.,"It is very close to the bus stop, close to city center and Eco Grad Hotel! It's a nice afternoon to play around, walk, and take pictures. I'd make sure to go there when visiting this city, Suncheon! "
Get your cameras ready,"A great place for pics. The old buildings, shanty shacks and views are very profile pic worthy. A great place to spend 2 hours casually strolling about"
Interesting place to visit,"My family visited here coming back from Suncheon Bay. Must visit if you're a K-Drama fan. If you'd like to see how Korea was between 60' and 70' this is the places to visit. It was used to film K-Drama East of Eden and King of Baking, Kim Tak Goo and many others. "
amazing!,"if you watched a lot of old movies or series, you'll appreciate this place. bring tripod and extra battery to capture those shots!very helpful and honest staff, i was able to get back my phone. Thanks."
"Interesting setting, very cool and for little money...","If you like K-drama, or you ever wanted to walk a television and movie set, then this place is interesting to pass like 1 - 2 hours at. This lot features a great diversity of 'areas' spanning from 14th century looking villages, to late 19th century and then 20th century village and city scenes. Amazing craftsmanship, a veritable mini walk though time. I really got a kick out of this unexpected stopover when down in Suncheon."
A must-see for film fans,"The other half is a HUGE Korean cinema fan, so we visited Suncheon especially to see this, stopping off on our way from Yeosu to Jeonju. It's an easy bus ride from the main train station and then a short walk to the set. Entry is inexpensive, it was very quiet when we visited (April 2014) and there's a café on site selling snacks. This is a group of permanent sets of mid-20th century Korea including a hillside shanty town and village.You're free to wander around and in and out of some of the buildings: the shanty town is on a steep hill but definitely worth the climb, even if it's hot. It's been used as a backdrop for lots of TV and films including Wolf Boy and Gangnam Blue. If you like Korean cinema it's a lot of fun but if it's historical drama sets you are after, you'll be disappointed."
All in Korean Drama Experience ^^,"On top of the many reasons why people travel to South Korea is to visit the drama set / film location of their favorite Korean series or movies. Unfortunately, one may really have to travel to so many places, as a result, so much money will have to be spent and too much precious travel time (as in commute/transportation) it will consume for they are situated in different location. In Suncheon Drama Film set, the quote “two birds in one stone” applies. Actually, more than two birds. It is home to many of Korea’s popular series or movies. Running Man, East of Eden, Sunny, Baker King/King of Baking, Gangnam Blues or Gangnam 1970 to name a few.This is actually a major flashback to old Korea during the 1950’s up to the 1990’s. To complete your flashback, the studio lets you rent clothes (school, military uniforms and stuff). Perfect for your photo op and completes your Korean movie experience. You are now a Hallyu Star. Enjoy!"
Interesting place that retains a bit of the old world charm.,"Came here as part of a group on the Suncheon City Tour and it was interesting as it had remnants of the 60s, 70s and 80s. Many famous films were filmed here and it's a nice place to take photographs, especially for a photo shoot. It wasn't really crowded, and that was a good thing as you don't want people to photobomb your photographs right? There were old houses, a cinema and even a bus-stop that you can snap to your heart's delight."
A bit small,"A bit small compared to what I expected. If you have watched the dramas or movies filmed there, you may find it more interesting."
