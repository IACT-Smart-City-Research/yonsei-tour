Just wow,"I took this cruise because my friends urged me to and I do not regret it.First off, as someone afraid of birds, I had a hard time going on the upper deck because of the seagulls but they only approach people trying to feed them so rest assured. I'm torn because on Saturdays, there is the 5pm ride where you can see the beautiful sunset and there is the 6:30/7pm ride with fireworks (times vary by season).On the lower deck, there are multiple performances. Dancing, singing....I'm gushing too much but it was just so much fun "
Great sea gull feeding experience,"The ferry terminal is very Yeongjong seaside rail bike park. Buy some prawn crackers at the pier convenient store as the birds favorite treats as advised by our tour guide. About half an hour to Incheon. The birds are smart and aggressive. Need some skill to hold the prawn crackers to keep fingers bitten by sea gulls. Anyway, super fun!!!!"
