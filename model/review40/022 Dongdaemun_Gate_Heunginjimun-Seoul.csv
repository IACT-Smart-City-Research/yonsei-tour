Great architectural treasure,"Amazing building, really worth the visit and spending some time to soak it all in!Super easy to access via the subway system and conveniently located, this is a must visit!"
Landmark in central Seoul,"This is one of 8 gates. You could not enter when I was there, only a photo from outside.Its name means great east gate.You can access it from either subway 1 or 4."
Impressive - combine with a visit to the City Wall Museum,"Walk past Dongdaeumun Design Centre, and keep walking straight - the Heunginjimun Gate will suddenly appear in view. It's an impressive structure - a two tiered building on a solid stone base in which there is a tunnel which housed the gate. This is the East Gate of Seoul, one of four main gates in the old Seoul City Wall. The Gate was first built by King Taejo during his fifth year of reign (1398). It was renovated in 1453, and the current structure is the one rebuilt in 1869.What is particularly impressive is the half circle outer wall enclosure (the Ongseong). This was a powerful defensive device because visitors who entered were surrounded. It also protects the gate against a battering ram.You can view it from all around, but there is no entry.To best view it, you need to cross the road up to the Heunginjimun Gate Park which is where the City Wall now starts, and view it on eye level.Information about the gate is sparse, even though the small information placard states it is Korea's National Treasure number 1. To find out more and to see the Jaspyan statues up close, visit the Seoul City Wall Museum which is about 100 metres up in the Heunginjimun Gate Park. It's free to visit, has scale models and a lot of fascinating information about the gate and the Seoul City Wall.See my photos."
Great Eastern Gate,"I came across this massive gate, one of the four major entrances to Seoul centuries ago, while walking to the nearby Dongdaemun Design Center. An imposing structure, this is the only city gate with a small wall that was constructed to give the Joseon Dynasty fortress additional protection against invaders. Though originally built in 1398, the gate has undergone many restorations, and it appeared to me that one must have occurred quite recently, based on its current excellent condition.Located in an extremely busy traffic area, this Eastern gate can be difficult to reach on foot. Though I managed to do so, the entrance was blocked off and the effort to get there hardly seemed worthwhile. I ended up ascending a small hill across the street by the Seoul City Wall. This provided a superb vantage point for the gate and the surrounding neighborhood. My visit occurred during the afternoon. Later, when I walked by at night, the gate had been beautifully illuminated and I had an even better appreciation of the structure. Dongdaemun Gate is about a 5-minute walk from the Dongdaemun Subway stop (Lines 1 and 4). Take Exit 1 or 6 - 10."
"Lovely picture op, but you can't get close.","One thing I hate about Seoul is how bloody difficult it can be to cross the street. You can't really get close to the gate because of how the gates are set up, so don't feel bad if none of your pics turn out right. After some shopping at the nearby namdaemun market, you can come here for some shots. There's several of these bad boys around Seoul, so go catch em all."
"Interesting gate, can't get close","Interesting gate, but not as accessible or explained as well as the Sungnyemun Gate. Good for some photos and as a point to start a longer walk to explore the Seoul City Wall, which commences just North of the Dongdaemun Gate and climbs up to Naksan Park."
Imposing gate in Dongdaemun,"Also known as Heunginjimun Gate, it is the largest gate in Seoul. A unique feature is the half-circle shaped wall to protect the gate. In fact, it is the only gate among Seoul’s eight gates to have this wall. For a good photo shoot, suggest you cross the road and climb uphill for about 5 to 10 mins in Dongdaemun Seonggwak Park. I visited during the late afternoon. I suppose evening is a better time to appreciate the buildings with the lighting."
Lovely . . .,"Though reconstructed several times throughout its 700 year history it is a magnificent monument to the Joseon Dynasty. Though inspiring from street level, it is even more impressive from the lounge or roomss facing from the JW Marriott Dongdaemun Square."
Great looking gate,"Looking at the pictures, I should have gone at night. But even during the day the gate looks very impressive."
Heunginjimun Gate (Dongdaemun Gate) - One of the 8 Majestic Gates of Seoul,"Heunginjimun, literally ""Gate of Rising Benevolence"" or Dongdaemun, is one of The Eight Gates of Seoul in the Fortress Wall of Seoul, a prominent landmark in central Seoul. The Korean name ""Dongdaemun"" means ""Great East Gate,"" and it was so named because it was the major eastern gate in the wall that surrounded Seoul during the Joseon Dynasty. The structure was first built by King Taejo during his fifth year of reign (1398). It was renovated in 1453, and the current structure is the one rebuilt in 1869."
stands out like a gem at night from a distance,"The gate is across from the JW Marriott hotel, within walking distance of the Dongdaemun metro. It's best to view it in the evening as the lights make it shine like a jewel from a distance. We went in the evening the gate was closed. Not sure if it opens during the day, doesn't look like it though."
Most spectacular at night,"Seoul has many ancient historic gates scattered around the city, but the Dongdaemun gate is one of the most impressive. Certainly it is very well located just across the road from our hotel providing us with magnificent views especially from the rooftop of the hotel.The gate is also very close to so many of the shopping malls and clothing accessory markets and even close to the Cheonggyecheon stream that runs through the city. It is also just a few minutes walk from the Dongdaemun Design Plaza (DDP). Really well worth visiting this site in the evening time."
A must stop,Great place to take a picture and admire the architecture. It is just across the street from the metro and near department stores and close to the clothing market.
Simple yet magnificent gate,We were lucky to see changing of guards ceremony when we happen to be passing by the area. The uniforms of the guards were exactly what we saw in the Korean telenovelas.
"It looks grand, both in the day and night","This structure is currently in the middle of a busy road junction, and a short walk from the metro station. It looks grand, both in the day and night, and is well worth a detour if you are in the Dongdaemun neighbourhood. "
Neat!,"Got to check out Dongdaemun gate during the day. The area is good to explore. At night, it is lit up nicely."
Beautiful at night,"We did not have chance to visit during the day so popped by in the evening to wander around the outside. It was beautifully lit up and looked magnificent. It is a little tricky to get over to, due to its location in the middle of a busy road, but was worth being patient for. Impressive!"
Magnificent City gate located in Dongdaemun.,"Dongdaemun is a wonderful area in Seoul to explore, one special feature of the area is Heunginjimun Gate or East Gate. This version of the gate was built in 1869, the original was built in 1396 and was the main gate of four of the Seoul City Wall (Hanyangdoseong), it is listed as the National Treasure No.1. We walked passed the gate after our visit to the Dongdaemun History and Culture Park on our way to the Seoul City Wall Museum. Highly recommend."
Another National Treasure No. 1,"The gate is the only one in Seoul which has a semi circular wall at the back and the image has been on quite a few guidebooks etc. It's a shame you can't walk through it and can only admire it from outside. If you climb a short distance up along the city walls across the road, you can have quite a nice view of the gate and the design plaza nearby. "
Nice historical site in heart of city,"Its good historical site, very clean surrounding and informational details added advantage to know the place better.You can also visit near by underground market with affordable prices. There is one art museum also to visit nearby. Uploading photos."
A picturesque monument!,"However, apart from being an important monument, the Dongdaemun Gate is also an integral part of today's city. It is lively and vibrant in the context of the modern City and bustles with life."
Beautiful building opposite Marriott,Looks lovely in the evening opposite to Marriott hotel. The square is pretty busy and well lit. Love walking around the area with places to shop and eat.
Old gate to east of central Seoul,Historic gate. Close to markets. Seems to be fenced off. Part of the old wall is here. Can walk along the wall
Worth passing by,This seems strange set on the middle of a road intersectionGiven all the other similar structures in the city you could give it a miss but if you are nearby it is worth a look and a piccy or two
Ancient architecture among modern buildings ,"This is Dongdaemun gate, you will see it as you walk out from the station in Dongdaemun area . The gate stands out among the modern building , it's historical architecture was well preserved. "
Another iconic gate,"Right across the street from the JW Marriott, this gate is worth seeing but nothing else to commend it in the area."
East gate of Seoul,This wall the capital throughout Joseon Dynasty. You can walk around the outside and view the wall. There is a brief history of this wall posted outside. Across the street is the City of wall and Museum. There are street vendors that sells good and food near by. Plenty of malls too.
East Gate of Seoul City Wall,One of the two largest gates in Seoul. It has a stone archway in the retaining wall linked to the city wall and a wooden pavillion was constructed on it. The metro station is very close by.
Nice place,"Very nice place to visit, also some outlet malls are there and street shopping market, the metro station is very close."
Nice to see the citywall,Heunginjinmun is nice to see dont miss the citywall if you stand infront like in the Picture its to the right side cross the road and get upp on wall soo nice view of the city. and near by undergruond shoppingmall.
관광,"서울에는 동서남북으로 대문이 있다 동대문 서대문 남대문 북대문 그동안 군사적인 이유 등으로 개방이 되지 않았던 북대문 조만간 일반에 공개되고그 모습을 드러낼 준비를 하고 있다. 사대문중에 남대문과 동대문은 큰 재래시장이다 먹을거리 입을거리 관광 지로서 꼭가볼곳중 하나인 동대문시장In Seoul, there is a gate to the north, south, east, and west. Dongdaemun, Seodaemun, Namdaemun, and North Gate. The North Gate, which had not been opened for military reasons, is now open to the public and ready to be revealed. Namdaemun and Dongdaemun are big traditional markets among the four major monuments. I recomend Dongdaemun No 1 best Market "
Historical ,Nice Historical site of the old kingdom. There is a huge shopping area featuring 24hrs wholesale nearby. Tons of resturants and cafe nearby.
A beautiful old building,This gate is beautiful. Not much more to say actually. It is well preserved and looks good. But surrounded by modern buildings. Well worth passing by and take some pics of it.
Okay..,"You need to go underground to get here and there's nothing much other than the huge gate. But it's near Dongdaemun Market, Seoul Station and the newly opened Seoul Overpass. So swing by these places after a visit to this gate. "
One of the Eight gates of Seoul,"Very impressive at night all lit up. This is only one of the 8 gates of the city. Out of all the gates I've seen this and the Namdaemun are the most impressive. 10 minutes from the metro station. Head towards Doota, the Big Owl!Be careful crossing the road here as its busy."
Striking contrast to its modern surroundings,"The Dongdaemun Gate stands majestically in striking contrast to its modern surroundings, namely the Dongdaemun shopping district, the busy road intersection and the Dongdaemun Design Plaza. Not as grand as the Gwanghwamun Gate (in front of Gyeongbokgung Palace), but still worth a camera click before you proceed for your shopping in the Dongdaemun malls. For a perfect vantage point of the gate, walk up the hill along the Seoul City Wall."
鬧市中的寧靜 A peaceful and quiet place in the crowd.,"Well, u know Dongdaemun is a crowded place, esp the Dongdaemun cultural and history park. Just walk a little bit towards the Dongdaemun, you can have a bit of hiking along the blocks and have a sit ard the green and floral lawn. Takes within half an hour to go up all the way. You can find a cozy coffee shop to take a break, and enjoy a piece of quite near the local residential area on the slope. Highly recommended to visit if you're looking for a relaxing and slightly sporty trip."
And absolute beautiful experience,I really love this place and I think all people that visit Seoul should come here at least once. It is full of history and for people to be able to understand Seoul and Korea is this really an important place. 
Wonderful but under construction,It's one of gate of ancient Seoul and also wonderful and especially at night. But it's under construction and I could see one side of it. I think this gate is the start point to trip to the center of seoul or walk through the route of ancient Seoul fortress wall.
Impressive historical building,Found the building after coming out from the train station. It is difficult to miss it. The gate is under renovation and you can only take photos from the outside.
Interesting ,This is not something you are required to do if time is limited however it is a nice walk around the area and you can see the ongoing construction where modern architecture meets the ancient. 
Great to see some history of Seoul,It's pretty easy to get here. It's just across the road from Dongdaemun market. Great to see the history of Seoul. Can be a bit touristy. Worth a visit.
Landmark Structure of Dongdaemun,"The structure looks grand and imposing, although it is still undergoing renovations at my last visit in early April 2017. Suggest to take a short walk along the old city walls at night. From here, you can get a nice view of the gate plus all the modern buildings surrounding the gate. A structure of historical significance. There is a museum in the vicinity as well (2 min walk away from the gate), although I did not get to visit it as it was closed at night."
Landmark,"National treasure~ this gate is one of the eight gates surrounding Seoul City Wall. The fortress walls around the gate were destroyed long ago, bu the gate remains the same as it was in Joseon period. It is definitely one of the top tourist attraction spot. There are many shopping places near the gate too!"
One of four gates,One of four gates in seoul. The biggest gate n very beautiful at night . Located at centre of seoul.
"The ""biggest"" of the six gates","With a big stone base underneath, this two-storied gate (direction-wise, it's the East Gate) is the ""biggest"" of Seoul's six gates of which I got to three with Sungnyemun (the South Gate, a big gate also with two stories and just slightly smaller than this one, near Seoul Station) and the Southeast Gate (a ""considerably smaller"" gate just about a 10-minute walk south from this gate) being the other two besides this one; didn't get to the three in the north (the North Gate, the Northeast Gate & the Northwest Gate), but I'm quite sure those are just small ones nothing on the scale of this one & Sungnyemun (the South Gate). The Gate is only to view from outside (cannot go inside the archway through the stone base or go up on the stairs to above), but just its ""imposing structure"" definitely makes it ""stand out"" in the area which is fairly wide-open (the Gate is not clustered around by buildings, and actually just across the street from it on one side is a grassy high ground with a stretch of the city wall over it and a beautiful small church on the other side of that wall - a ""pretty serene"" scene really in the middle of the city). And shortly after 8 pm, it's an ""illuminated view"" of the Gate that you'll see (the lower story turns ""golden"").Coming by subway, Dongdaemun Station (on Lines 1 & 4) is the nearest one, but what I would actually like to suggest (for ""a lot more fun"") is to get off at Dongdaemun History & Culture Park Station (on Lines 2, 4 & 5) where you'll be at a ""very lively"" area with big department stores (such as Lotte & Doota), the interesting-shaped Dongdaemun Design Plaza with the History & Culture Park on the other side and a lovely night market with mobile kiosks spread out here & there on the sidewalk along one side of the big Jangchungdan-ro street along which just about a 10-minute walk north (be sure to walk through that lovely night market) will bring you to the popular Cheonggyecheon Stream (below the ground level but also great to just look at from above) and just across that stream (so just on the north side of the stream) is this magnificent gate."
One of the main Gates to old Seoul City,"Currently being renovated, but the sign on the outside says it will be completed in April 2017. Good views of the gate when walking from the City wall."
Hidden treasures!,"When the taxi pulled on the curbside, I didn't see any outside vendors and excitement so I asked the taxi driver to take be back to Nandaemun. Little did I know, the vendors were in this building called Doota. But then I also heard it was a little more high-end which I didn't want. Maybe the next time I go back to Korea, I'll take a look in the Doota building and see what they have."
Dongdaemun gate,Amazing view in the middle of the city. Beautiful at night. Great for some pictures. Lots of places to eat around
Breathtaking gate ,Witnessing the history of Seoul in the middle of the bustling square is priceless.The gate's design is brilliant and the marks of history and war are overwhelming.The challenge is to take a photo with no traffic.
witnessing the history of Seoul/Korea!,"Touted as Korean National Treasure #1 동대문 - 흥인지문 is 1 of the 8 gates protecting ancient Seoul City Wall, what we see now is the Gate w/o the fortress Walls (collapsed or damaged). Also known as the East Gate (Heunginjimon) the gate has a semi-circular protective wall (to protect the gate!). The gatehouse is a two-story building and the gate features a hipped roof.There is no access allowed beneath the gate arch nor to the arch roof or gatehouse so people can just feels the lower wall and admire the magnificence from a further distance. One can get a photo of the dragon mosaic on the arch roof. Bullet marks from the Korean war are visible on the lower section of the gate if you view them at close range.The gate is quite in the center of the very busy intersection. It’s magnificent structure grace Seoul's skyline amid the modern bldg. surrounding it. It is just within 8 mins from our Hotel at Dongdaemun so we walked past it day & night for a good 4-days. To get an independent photo without traffic or people is always a challenge!. Here we share some day & night photos shot. It is close to nearby Dongdaemun design Plaza, dongdaemun market and dongdaemun history & culture museum, ontop of food shops cafes. Really great location!We especially love the night charm it exhaulted. Not to be missed… The architecture of this itself is worth seeing."
Beautiful at night,We chanced upon the Dongdaemun Gate on the way to the night markets and Design Museum. It's beautifully lighted at night. It was drizzling and a bit cold that's why we didn't have time to go up close and check the facade.It's a must see in the area especially at night.
Looking good gate,"Dongdaemun means east gate that is one of main four gates in seoul. People used to pass this gate to go to the capital in Chosun Period. It's close to tour the dongdaemun design Plaza, dongdaemun market and dongdaemun history & culture museum from the dongdaemun gate."
A well taken care of monument in the middle of the city,"A perfect place to take some pictures if you're having a morning city walk after a sumptuous breakfast, or during a free-and-easy period away from the tour. The gate is surrounded by convenient and food shops, a market and a very busy main street during weekdays so take care when you cross the road. There are places for kids to run around behind the building, and some chairs to rest your weary feat and admire the old palace-like gate."
Take a break in-between your hectic shopping here ,"Historical and inspirational gate, best of all, it sits in the middle of Seoul's hyper shopping heaven area. Take a break, take a look at the historical gate, especially at night has its own charm."
Unique gate design in the middle of a busy intersection,"This gate is also known as the East Gate (Heunginjimon). It may be easily reached by taking subway Line 1 to Dongdaemun, and exit # 6. The rear of the gate is visible as soon as you are out of the subway. It is at a busy traffic intersection and pictures of the rear of the gate and the surrounding semi-circular protective wall can be easily taken.The gate was originally built in 1398,and rebuilt in 1869.This is the only gate of the Seoul Fortress with a semi-circular protective wall (ongseong). Bullet marks from the korean war are visible on the lower section of the gate.Access is not allowed beneath the gate arch, as there is a security gate that prevents access. If not too crowded, it is possible to get a photo of the dragon mosaic on the arch roof. There is no access to the gatehouse.To get a good picture of the front of the gate, it will be necessary to cross the road directly in front of the gate and take the photo from there.Admission is free, and viewing time is 15 minutes. This was our second stop on our day trip to view all of the Seoul Fortress gates."
"a beautiful gate, sitting in the middle of a busy district.","you cant go in, but you can take some really nice pics. i recommend a video shot because it is cool to see the contrast between old and new coming together nicely. it is quite old, and lovely. "
Sits proudly in the middle of traffic chaos,"The oldest of the city gates with beautifully exposed city walls has been preserved with the 21st century road system built around it.Stands out loud and proud, adds lots of class to the area."
A reminder of the historical past,"It is great to see this old gate lit up at night but at the same time, I definitely would prefer a old seoul rather than the new one. Surrounded by the modern buildings that grace Seoul's skyline, this is a nice break along with Dongdaemum history and culture park."
Massive old gate in the middle of Seoul,This is a massive gate that was built in 1398 by King TejeoIts best viewed at night due to the lighting its walking distance from Myeongdong Best for history lovers
Old Korea surrounded by modern Korea,"The gate is on the corner of a very busy intersection. Getting a decent photo without traffic is a challenge, nevertheless the architecture of this magnificent building is worth seeing. Of particular interest to me was the defensive crescent wall, no present in most other gates in the city."
Historical gate that is easy to reach,This gate will make a quick visit but a good photo opportunity. The area offers cheap and tasty restaurants and it is a good starting point for the excellent Seoul city wall hike. Come at night and day if possible to get different views. 
Beautiful gate at night..,"Enormous gate where you can also see some of the preserved eastern wall in the nearby park. The gate is closed so you can't go through it (unlike Namdaemun Gate). In the evening, the lights will show a beautiful view of the gate."
"Gate of Rising Benevolence ""Great East Gate""","Known as Heunginjimun Gate, the ""Gate of Rising Benevolence"" is commonly known as Dongdaemun. It is one of 8 gates of Seoul, ""Dongdaemun"" means ""Great East Gate,"" it was named Dongdaemun because it was the major eastern gate in the wall that surrounded Seoul during the Joseon Dynasty."
Eateries 9/F Hyundai City Outlets Dongdaemun,"Reasonably priced. The two restaurants offering hotpots(1'30"") and buffets(1'40"") are flexible for those who opt for less spicy food. Outback there serves Korean style dishes, interesting!"
Gates in a Walled City,"Seoul has a number of such architecturally significant Gates - a necessity, being a walled city. They are all a bit different, but worth seeing. You can also see sections of the wall that surrounded Seoul.We found this one - the East Gate - after an evening walk along Cheonggyecheon Stream.We also found the South Gate - near the Namdaemun market, but regrettably, I didn't get to see any of the others."
Gate of Rising Benevolence," The Eight Gates of Seoul in the Fortress Wall of Seoul in central Seoul, South Korea. The Korean name ""Dongdaemun"" means ""Great East Gate,"" and it was so named because it was the major eastern gate in the wall that surrounded Seoul during the Joseon Dynasty. A combination of History, Heritage and Culture."
Seoul history,Passing by Dongdaemun Gate every day when I was in Seoul. Seoul was a walled city long long time ago and there are pieces of historical evidence passed down to the present day.
Great!,I decided to drop by since I was around the street. It's nice to snap some pics but it's usually filled with locals and tourists.
First thing we have seen in Seoul,The gate is located in a busy junction near Dongdaemun metro station and Dongdaemun Market. Walk up to the hilly park nearby and enjoy the view at night.
awesome,you have two options to get here: by the traing or you can just walk from myeong dong. I would suggest to challenge yourself to walk so you can appreciate the scenery: Cheonggyecheon Stream & Cheonggye Plaza to be specific.
Night view is great.,During the day the view of the great gate isn't so great but at night with the lights it's something great to be seen but it's not worth separate trip to see it. 
See it day or night.,This great historical Gate is surrounded by a large shopping area. It is very graceful in shape and its form and large in size. It is built in the style of the famous Joseon period and designated as National Treasure of Korea No 1. at least a brief visit to the gate area seems to be included in every trip to Korea. At night it is illuminated.
Dongdaemun Gate,"Heunginjimun, one of the eight gates in Seoul. This is only a walking distance from the dongdaemun subway."
Just a structure!,We didn’t actually look for the gate but while wandering in Dongdaemun we came across and that was the last picture for that night we took. good for fotos. After that we headed our hotel taking a taxi.Area around is very safe for tourist!
Make it part of the circuit,If you want to walk and see the Seoul Fortress and Wall - and their gates need to be planned out in advance if you are here for only a short holiday. This gate is impressive and most impressive when you make it part of an adventure walking the wall. The wall is long and massive. So it will take some days. This gate is cool because it sits in the middle of chaos and close to modern Seoul. 
Just gate itself.,"It was a part of great wall, but most of them were torn down in the past. And this gate was burned few years ago, so it is not authentic version. You don't need to drop by this place at all. Just take a shot while you are passing by."
Beautiful but the area is very busy,"The gate itself is beautiful and if you get a chance to walk along the walls up the hill you can really appreciate the scenery and get some great pics of the old/new with the gate vs city motif. At the same time, this gate is right in the heart of a busy intersection so it's harder to spend much time in front of the gate itself. Tip: there's a subway stop right here so it's easy access"
"Difficult to appreciate, but area interesting. ",Getting close to this gate is easy but you never get a really good look to put it in perspective. It is in the middle of a very busy traffic intersection. Very interesting alleys and markets around this area. Very easy to get to also. The Cheonggyecheon stream walk is excellent showcasing how well the Sth Koreans utilise public space. 
A great piece of architecture,nothing to see here. unless you have a good tour guide. Lots of history and one of the few structures to survive the Korean war in this part of Seoul.
On of the grand gates to the city,"The gate is very impressive. The size of the lower stones, the bullet marks from the Korean war, and the two dragon mosaic on the ceiling within the gate, are all worth seeing. To get a picture of the dragon mosaic, place you tablet or phone on the stone floor and position it so you see the two dragons. Then place yourself in the picture by looking down at your phone in a corner of the image. The size and grandeur of the gate is impressive. Unfortunately, today its hemmed in by busing city streets. Nevertheless, well worth a visit. It's also close to the Dongdaemun market."
tourist attraction,Stunting architecture with great history and huge local shopping district. Cheap and trendy clothing stalls/shops everywhere.
Cool to see,"Not so much an attraction as it is a site you'll come across when coming to Dongdaemun. The actual structure is quite impressive, while Dongdaemun is only good to check out for a short period of time..."
Most memorable cultural experience - seeing the real people of Seoul,"One of the most memorable experiences in Seoul. The people are so genuine, nice, hard working, many elderly and prices were dirt cheap. Definitely lower end open market shopping but got my super nice bright green hard case luggage set from the funniest elderly man that really made our night! Clothing here though not department store type, was the same as what was found in other open markets yet much cheaper. Pants for $9 US, long knit tops for $11 US, got a great knock off DKNY long sweatshirt dress for $20 US. The people here were so nice and obviously barely making ends meat that we didn't try to bargain, yet they kept showering us with free gifts. "
East gate at night,On the corner of a heavy traffic area..4AM visit was more peaceful for a short outside walk to decompress after 14 flight from USA. Park is nice
Nice view of an ancient city gate.,"The gate and nearby city wall are well preserved and worth a look when you visit Dongdaemun. The city was at one time surrounded by a wall of stone blocks, which was quite high from the outside."
you can buy the clothes and shoes reasonably,"You can buy many apparel by negotiating with store clerks by Korean language.if you can talk freely, here become more awesome place. it's so reasonable but cheap a little.that's why 4 star. teenagers and young people can enjoy uppermost."
Open all Day all Night,"This is the place to shop after 10PM till morning!! All shops are open all night long. Make sure you bargain on the price, as first price can Usually be negotiated for 20-30% less.I do not like Korean street food, but if you do, there are plenty of shops for eating.If a shopkeeper is sleep, do not wake him/her up to ask for a price!!"
it is still a place to be,Amazing in its history and architecture I haven't been there in 5 years but it still has a unique charm and character . When you first see it and drive by you wonder about its history and marvel about what it took to rebuild after the war. Now it is smog and vehicle emissions that seem to take its toll. Still it remains as a testament to its past and to it and the city's future.
Little gem! ,"I really loved the place, and surprisinfly present. At first I thought I was in another country because of all the expats walking around. But its truly nice. The food was very affordable and delicious!"
A spot to take picture,"The gate is still under partial renovation, but it is a historic gate . When I visited there, it was long holidays and no shoppers around , I did get some pretty photos of it."
"Good Place for Shopping Clothes,Kids Toys,Bags etc.","Best place to visit to buy Kids Toys, T-shirts, Jackets, Bags etc, in almost cheaper price.Night Shopping also very good for good and best prices clothes."
Historical Gate,"Like the Namdaemun, this is another historical gate in the middle of an intersection. Apart from a few pictures to say ""I've been to Dongdaemun, and have seen the gate"", there's really nothing much else to see or experience.Of course, as a shopping and eating destination, Dongdaemun ranks quite highly in Seoul, and that I cannot disagree. The Migliore and APM Mall are two malls with good bargains on clothes, bags and shoes, while Doota is a bit more upmarket. Stay till past 9pm to see the street shops up in their full glory, for even more shopping madness."
"An ornamental gate, but that's it.","The gate is located in the middle of a busy road.It was being partially renovated during our visit in July 2014.The gate itself, while rather big, sort of fails to impress during the day.It is only after dark, when it is dramatically lit, that it seems half decent.A 5-minute visit is all you need."
Interesting bit of History in a Market area,"Quite similar to Namdaemun (southern gate of Seoul), this gate is a nice piece of Korean traditional architecture. It was used as a checkpoint when the city walls were still existent but today it is just a memorial. I went hunting for it after I left the market to see what it was."
Don't waste time. Take a picture and go.,"Right in the middle of the road is this Dongdaemun Gate. Nothing to see when you go close, so simply take a picture from far and walk off. That's it."
Twin of Namdaemun gate,"Quite similar to Namdaemun (southern gate of Seoul), this gate is a nice piece of Korean traditional architecture. It was used as a checkpoint in the past when the city walls were still existent but nowadays it looks like a memorial. Nice for taking a few photos, when visiting the Dongdaemun market."
Korean Icon,This gate shows the beautiful ancient Korean architecture and It is great that the restoration work has It still standing.
Only for Shopping,"If you like shopping, it is the best place, but for sightseeing, I do not recommend"
Really nice place,I visited there at night and it's really a nice place. It is lightening very good and not too much traffic at night so I could take pictures as much as I wonted
Under Construction,"If you plan on visiting Seoul and taking awesome pictures of the 'gates' that surround the city, I recommend you forgo visiting this one until construction and remodeling efforts are finished. The local are has lots to offer for entertainment, I am sure once construction is complete this will be an awesome gate to visit."
"Beautiful, a must see historic site",A beautiful piece of history in Seoul. On the edge of Namdaemun market which is a must-see authentic market. We enjoyed hearing about the history of the gate from our tour guide.
Worth seeing if you like Korean history on Seoul,"This gate is also known as Heunginjimun is one of the 8 gates of old Seoul - its actually quite beautiful sitting there all alone in the middle of the road no longer important as it used to be!There are a lot of shops around the place so it would be good to add this in when exploring other areas, if you walk further up you will find some parts of the old Seoul wall and you can take a walk along the wall and get beautiful views of the city from the top"
Gate of Rising Benevolence,"More correctly known as Heunginjimun - the 'Eastern Gate' dates was originally established in the 14th Century. The current structure is said to have been built in 1869. Unlike Sungnyemun (near Namdaemun Markets) you could not walk through the gate, only admire its beauty from across the road. The more interesting attraction is the Dongdaemun Markets and Shopping Complex just adjacent to the gate."
A piece of history surrounded by a sea of shopping and eateries,Located in the Dongdaemun shopping area and near the Dongdaemun station. The gate is literally on an island surrounded by busy roads with the shopping and eateries nearby (for which Dongdaemun is well known). The gate is well preserved with interesting facts on signboards around the gate. Worth a stopover if you're shopping in the area. 
Great for a photo,"In its surrounding areas, there is great shopping and restaurants, even street food. Here at the Gate, we could only appreciate the massive gate, and took photos, however, there aren't anything to do so afterwards."
Another shopping area in Seoul ...,"This is another shopping area in Seoul, dominated with fashion shops and stalls. Both along the streets and in the surrounding malls. Huge range of clothes (and prices) to be found there, if shopping excites you."
Shopping at the Great Eastern Gate,"If you are here for the gate, you will be disappointed. Take time to browse the many many buildings housing small stalls and stores. There are both the modern and traditional shopping malls for all .. except the men, who like me decide to sit comfortably inside a coffee outlet, waiting for his wife to drop from an overdose of shopping."
An Interesting Market,"The last time we visited Dondaemun was some 15 years ago.This shopping area is known for mainly shoes,clothing &fashion mainly for the young or young at heartThe best shopping center is ""Doota"" where a wide range of fashionableclothes for the young are available. They have a wide range of accessoriestoo.One tip is to make your spectacles at the 6th floor of ""Doota"", they area bargain & they can be completed between 20 - 30 minutes !On the 7th floor is food court..where husbands can sit down whilst waiting fortheir spouses to finish their shopping !"
Dongdaemun,"this was not the shopping experience i was looking for. buildings surrounding the suway terminal were mostly textiles, bulk buttons, lace...ribbon. Something for a craft person maybe...not really stuff a tourist would want. there was a small amount of this type of thing avail on the large corners but all in all I would not spend the day here unless you happen to have a crafty person with you.Better shopping in namdaemun for the inexpensive clothes, knick nacs, etc.Now the dooda building has a ton of high end name brand stuff in it...but why would you come here for that...not what its all about here is it?"
