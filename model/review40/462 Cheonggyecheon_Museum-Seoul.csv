Definitely worth the visit,"Tells the story of the history of the Cheonggyecheon ""stream"" which is an iconic landmark in Seoul. With old maps and many old photos it traces its history from the 15th century to the present day. How it had been covered up and subsequently uncovered. Don't miss the portion of the original wooden stilt housing just across the road.Free to enter and easily reached by Metro and then a short walk."
A great museum to show the changes of the Cheonggyechong,"If you are interested in urban history or urban development, this museum is absolutely a great place to learn about how Cheonggyechong changed in the past decade. It includes the historical meaning of the river, as well as the social issues happened due to the economic boom after WWII and the detail of restoration of the river. Personally, I love this museum a lot as I can learn a lot about this amazing renewal project in Korea. Although Korean is still the main language in the museum, some important places would also have Japanese, English or Chinese explanation."
Fascinating Museum all about the Chenogyecheon River Restoration,"This is totally off the beaten track but is a medium sized museum overseen by the Seoul History Museum but which focuses solely on the Cheonggyecheon River--its role in Seoul's history and the amazing story of its restoration to become the center piece of Seoul's ""greening."" The Museum is set up beautifully with you starting at the top of the Museum and working your way through history to the present at the bottom. That is suppose to represent the flow of the stream downhill. Great photos of Seoul in the past and all is in English for easy understanding. I visited the main Seoul History Museum also--and found this one to be much easier to understand and much more interesting. Few tourists make it here but was worth my time! Would recommend over the main History Museum. Its free too!"
Great photo journey back in time. ,The Cheongyecheon Museum is a wonderful look at the important role the Cheongyecheon area played in Seoul's development. It also offers insight into the political environment that influenced the redevelopment of Cheonggyecheon. The pictures from the 1880's were fantastic. All of the displays translated to English. Outside of the Museum is a mockup of a shanty town that is a great back drop for memorable pictures. The Museum is free and on a hot day is a nice cool excursion. 
Excellent museum (for this subject),"The museum isn't near the ""headwaters"" of the stream where most people go, but it's worth visiting if you have time. Or sign up for the #2 option in the City of Seoul's free walking tours and visit then (that's what we did). There is also a replicated shanty town example at this site. The section of stream in this area is more rustic and also worth walking along for the different perspective it provides."
Know more about the past,There is the main building of the Cheonggyecheon Museum with a lot of display and educational videos shown and opposite of the museum are the old houses of Cheonggyecheon.
A hidden Gem,"Seems like no one knows about this place. My friend and I wandered around for approximately two hours and saw only one other person.This fantastic free museum is dedicated to the re establishment of the Cheonggyecheon Stream that runs east to west through the heart of Seoul. The stream had been covered/filled in during the late sixties and an elevated expressway put over it. More than the story of the stream, this museum tells the story of Seoul and how the stream and the people of this city, their fortunes and misfortunes are linked. It talked about life before and after Japanese colonialism. The hardship of WWII very brief elation following liberation then the terrible years of the Korean War. The resulting mass waves of refugees and crushing poverty that lead to shanty towns lining the Cheonggyecheon. The museum goes on to look at the dismantling of these settlements. The forced re homing of communities to ""moon villages"" on the out skirts of Seoul. Of riots and civil unrest.This museum is so much more than a mere look at a marvel of engineering... Which is what the resurrection of the stream is. It was the best insight into the recent history of Seoul and Korea that I've found here during my stay. A look at all this country has achieved in seventy very short years.It's a little out of the way (being at the non glittery end of the Cheonggyecheon). But so worth the effort of finding it.and a half "
