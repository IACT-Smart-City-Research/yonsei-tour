Jongno jade shopping,Shopping for jade in the Jongno district is ok but I couldn’t find much jade stores but heaps of jewellery. Make sure you have good bargaining skills as some of the merchants can be tough.Can’t wait to be back there in December.
"A rare and vast area of jewellery, watch and goldsmith","There is approximately 4-5 kilometres of street grouping with sales centre of jewellery, gold, and pearl, which comes in thousands of hundreds of stores to make up the area so peculiar and special. It stretches from jonhmiao to Insadong with these shops to link 2 pieces of area. But the shops and products were not attractive nor the design of jewellery are good enough to retain customers. There are very low customer traffic, and makes the vast shop area look ugly and not lively."
Great selection and service?,"Kisha is a great shop for custom jewelry, and also has good selection of gold, diamonds and pearl items. Very nice service and helpful. Great experience and value."
