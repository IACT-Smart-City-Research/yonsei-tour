Tongdosa Temple,"Well worth the effort to get here, yes it is a bit out of the way, but when you see this beautiful temple you will forget about the journey, great hiking trails all around, fantastic areas for picnics so make a day of it, don't forget your camera, though you should not take photos inside the temple."
Beautiful temple complex,"We have been to Tongdosa temple today. It was quite an adventure to get there (metro to Busan bus terminal), 20 minutes in a nice bus and 1,5km beautiful walk. It was all worth it! We have tried in advance to arrange a temple stay. Unfortunately my mails to the website are still unanswered. On Tripadvisor the latest Review was outdated, so I thought that something was wrong with this site. Now we have seen it, it feels bad that the temple stay could not been arranged. Happy we did the half day trip! Good to combine with Beomeo-sa temple. "
"1400 Years old, serene, lovely in all seasons","I'm an English teacher nearby, as an assignment I had my students write on, ""a beautiful place in Yangsan"", all except one stuent chose Tongdosa. One of the students titled their paper something like, ""the four colors of Tongdosa"" explaining why Tongdosa is beautiful in all four season. It's an absolute jewel. Every time I visit I feel peaceful and relaxed. There are enough tourists, that you don't feel like your intruding in a sanctuary, but it doesn't feel crowded. There is English signage everywhere explaining the stories and meanings of different shrines. It was originally established during Korea's first regnant queen, Seondeok of Silla. One of the hermitages is dedicated to housing artifacts of the Buddha, including a bone of the Buddha, brought from Tang China by the Temple's founder Jajangyulsa.It is not only a historic place, but a living place. Once when I went, a local artist had installed multiple statues of ""The Little Prince"", with signage saying that the Little Prince reminds us of our childhood, and we can try to look at Tongdosa through the eyes of the little prince.There is a great museum, a spacious picnic area, and hiking trails above.If you're in Busan it's a bit of a nuisance to get there, but it's an absolute treasure."
Serene temple in beautiful countryside,"Even in the pouring rain, the temple and the landscape made an impression. A rather simpler temple than the ones we had seen in Japan, it conveyed a sense of peace and calm, nevertheless. Surrounded by bamboo and pine tree forests, the temple and the scenery represent the beauty of Korea, as put by our Korean friend. We were lucky enough to be taken there by our friend, as the temple is some way out of Busan. "
A beautiful and serene Temple near Busan,"Tongdosa is beautiful. It is a way out of Busan, but well worth the visit. There are no statues of Buddha, but there is a special picture. The Temple houses relics and is a major Buddhist place of worship."
MAJOR TEMPLE IN BUSAN,Tongdosa is one of the 3 major Temples in Korea Because the Real Shrines of BUDDHA are Preserved there.
Tongdosa - a fine temple near Busan,"Tongdosa can be reached by a 30 mins bus ride (from the Nopo metro / train station at the northern outskirt of Busan) plus 30 mins very pleasant stroll from the bus stop. It isn't mentioned by most tourist information brochures / sheets / maps although it is one of the 3 jewels of temple in Korea. It represents the Buddha because it houses the Buddha's sariras. The other two are Haeinsa near Daegu that represents the dharma because it houses the 80,000 wooden blocks of Tripitaka Koreana; and Songgwangsa near Gwangju that represents the Sanga because it's trained many famous monks. We are lucky to be able to see all 3 of them. Tongdosa is my second favourite after Haeinsa.After getting off from the bus station, it's less than 10 mins walk to reach the entrance gate (where we need to pay a small entrance fee like most other temples). Beyond the gate is a long walkway called ""dancing wind & cold pines"" path by a river, surrounded by many tall pine trees and decorated with stoned lamp posts. We reached the temple ground after a wonderful 20 mins stroll. Many timber buildings inside the temple ground are quite raw in design but offer a very harmonious and peaceful feeling. The small museum houses many buddha paintings which is gem. Behind the hall at the back of the temple ground is where the Buddha's sariras preserved. It is a restricted area but if people are interested they can have a glimpse through. We really enjoy the natural, unpretentious, harmonious and peaceful atmosphere of Tondosa."
The place you can spend some time!!!,"More than 1,000 years old, the temple contains the history of Buddhism. Plenty of monks, buildings, statutes, springs and scent of nature you can enjoy. Interested? I recommend it is the place you should visit if you want to know Korea. The location, close to Busan, the 2nd city in Korea."
Drive-in temple park!,"It's a really big and interesting temple complex, but the most interesting is that you can get into the park with your car and you can drive through the whole park, from one temple to the other. The nature inside the park is, at least, as beautiful as the temple buildings!"
History and sights all in one place Stunning!!!!,"To get here you can walk, drive, taxi or take a bus (then a 20 minuite walk approx).The temple is set in some fantastic landscape with forest, rivers and paths. Really is a tranquil place. I am not religious but even I admit I was impressed with this place. What gets me is that entrance is free, something other nations should offer. Facility are very good, food, drinks and shops. great place to spend the day and maybe take a packed lunch. Pleased I was able to see this."
Absolutely fab,Absolutely stunning.Hiking up the Yeongnam Alps to visit the largest zen Buddhist monastic complex in South Korea and the Buddha relics are preserved in several of the stupas. Reminded me of Ragjir/Vultures peak which I visited on my pilgrimage in India last year!!!We also wandered deep into the mountain forest following the foot tracks to the top and a couple of very friendly Korean monks invited us in for tea.  Don't leave Busan without seeing this! 
Absolutely stunning,"To get to the temple you need to do a little walking or have a car. No buses go to the actual temple.it was about a 20 minute walk from the entrance (which cost 3000 won to enter, or I was just stupid and paid and didn't need to.) there are many areas and temples to see and well worth any time it took to get there. There are actual relics from a Buddha there which makes it unique. It was a little crowded but not bad at all, and most things are in Korean and English."
Yangsan Tongdosan Temple,"Located in southern part of Mt. Chiseosan, Tongdosa Temple is famous for not having any Buddhist statues in the temple. This is because the real shrines of the Buddha are preserved here. The name 'Tongdosa' was named after the belief that mankind can be saved through Buddhism. After Monk Ja-Jang brought the shrines of Buddha from Dang China, Tongdosa Temple was built during Queen Sun-Deok's reign (646). Tongdosa Temple is said to have survived numerous wars and invasions, its Beopdeung (temple candle) has never gone out, for 1,300 years. Inside, there are 35 buildings and Pagoda's, and 14 small temples in its vicinity. The main building is designated as National Treasure No.290. The temple is similar to a museum because of the numerous relics inside. There are 19 local treasures and 794 local cultural properties inside the temple. In place of the Buddha statue, the Geumgang Stairs behind of the main building preserves the shrines of the Buddha. Mt. Chiseosan, has a beautiful view from the temple. The several hundred year-old pine trees lined up from the entrance to Ilju Gate, the small drum (used when praying in front of a Buddha figure) and bell, the sunset, the pond and the rocks and waterfalls behind the temple are grouped and called the 'Eight Famous Sceneries of Tongdosa Temple.'"
Important Temple in Korean history,"The temple is famous for relics from Buddha, apparently the diamond shaped square which is not accessible as of today, holds a very small pieve of Buddha. Post his death. Its a key temple. Liked the fact that it seems to hold many monks and its also quite accessible, lots of open doors and pagodas etc. Worth a visit"
Temples of Korea,"One of the finest temples in the area. Excellent scenery and easy access with good parking. At the time of going, vehicular entramce was 5,000 korean won. Access to the mountains and good walks. Excellent architecture and open access to the buddhist temple and village."
Unexpected gift,"The temple complex is large and has Budda relics, The setting is stunning and we were fortunate to be there for the end of day show of drums and gongs performed by the monks. Best temple experience of my visit. it is also the largest temple complex in Korea. Well worth the visit. The buildings have been restored and brilliant colors. The """"Guardians"" are huge and the best examples I saw at any other temple I visited."
Breathtaking,"The Tongdosa temple is one of the most beautiful temples we have ever visited (and we have been all over the world). The history is astounding, since it was the only, or one of the only, temples that survived the Japanese invasion. Most other temples were unfortunately burnt down by the Japanese. The conservation effort that has gone into this temple is amazing since they have kept the tranquility and the spiritual essence of the place intact. We went in March and it was raining torrentially, but still, the experience was not hampered by the rain. More rain also mean less tourists, which was great. We had the whole temple all for ourselves and took some astonishing pictures. It was just us and the monks and nuns.Cost and time: We took the taxi from Haeuadae Beach and it took us a little under an hour. We agreed for the taxi driver to wait for us for 2 or 3 hours at the temple and then to drive us back, and it cost 140,000 won. Totally worth it."
Interesting walking tour,Learned more about the history and culture and basis of Buddhism in South Korea. To observe the way the monks lived and worked was an interesting insight into their lives.
Great temple with beautiful surroundings.,"This temple is one of Korea's three jewel temples. Easy enough to get to (close to Sinpyeong or Tongdosa bus terminal), once through the main gate ($2-3 entrance fee) enjoy about a 1.5 km walk along a beautiful path next to a small river that leads to the temple. Beautiful bridges, mountains, walking paths, and hiking trails surround the area. Unlike most other temples in Korea, Tongdosa has not been touched up recently so has distinct ancient quality to it. Be sure to check out the hermitages behind the main temple such as Jajangam Hermitage with its legends of the Golden Frogs. Tongdosa has a lot of small buildings, hermitages, and surroundings to explore, so is definitely among my favorite temples in Korea."
Relaxing place,"I lived right next to Tongdosa for a year. It's a very nice place to go for a quiet walk. It is rated as one of Korea's three gem temples and has the bonus of being one of the few temples not buried deep within a forest, for those of you that are looking for a relaxing stroll through a classic Korean temple without the extensive hike, Tongdosa is the place."
One of S. Korea's three Buddhist jewels,"This temple is easy to get to - just a subway (line 2) ride to the suburbs of Busan and a couple of rather short bus rides. It's the largest temple complex in S. Korea and has a nice museum (opened a little over 10 years ago) affixed to it. Assuming you're not driving, the walk up to the temple from its first front gate is gorgeous as well, and you can see boulders engraved with ancient names and sayings. Lots of visitors on non-religious/tourist visits spend time bathing, playing, and swimming in the river below the temple. It needs a bit more upkeep in some places, but I like it better than the UNESCO-designated Bulguksa. Also, it's surprising that Yangsan City would have so little public transportation going to this major tourist attraction."
Tongdosa Temple - Sacred and Interesting,"I went to Tongdosa Temple on a day trip. It is loaded with Korean History and landmarks. You have to walk a bit to see the good structures and statues, but if you are up for it, you could spend a day there and have a great time. I suggest bringing a snack."
