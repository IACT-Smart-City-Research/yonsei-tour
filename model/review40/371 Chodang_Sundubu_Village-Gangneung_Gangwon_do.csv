Tofu experience ,"Great place to visit for some traditional tofu restaurants. The tofu here is different as in other places because saltwater is used which makes the tofu soft. I really liked it. I ate at 농촉순두부 restaurant and had some tofu ice cream at 초당110. Give it a try, a good overall experience!"
"Lovely fresh tofu comparable to the best in Japan and Ipoh, Malaysia","After reading so much about sundubu (fresh tofu) as a specialty in Gangneung on the east coast of Korea, we decided to give it a try after walking the searoad or badabuchaegil.We headed to Chodang village and chose a restaurant without a queue and ordered the non spicy set. On taking the first mouthful of the sundubu, we were delighted to find the taste to be familiar as it is similar to the best of Japanese and Ipoh tofu.It was a simple set with few side dishes for which we paid 18,000 won for both of us. We then adjourned to a cafe across the road. The lovely pine trees around the cafe contributed to its nice laid back feel. This area is well served by cabs and was only a 5,000 won ride to the Gangneung station."
"Minimal English, need to point!","Short street lined with tofu shops. Some specialized in seafood, so check out store front pictures. Felt welcomed even though English was basically ""hot"" or ""no hot"". CC accepted. Also had a popular tofu ice cream. Daytime hours are best."
"Soft, milky, delicious tofu","Chodang Sundubu Village is a place where they serve soft, milky and delicious tofu. There are many restaurants to choose from but I was told that this one is the oldest and the most popular. You can tell they are popular with the long lines outside."
A street full of fish and tofu dishes,"This street is famous for popular dishes with Tofu and fish. You can order soup or thick curry with rice. It’s quit spicy but still worth trying because of speciality of the area. Recommended. Cost around 30,000 for 2 persons. "
Busy on Weekends!,"Our Airbnb was basically inside of the Tofu Village, which was great for us. We found the hours confusing -- not easy to get dinner on a weeknight as most places seemed to have closed around lunchtime, while Saturday was crawling with people. If you can figure out how to avoid the crowds but get to the shops when they're open, it's well worth it. The food is excellent and its a neat cultural experience. We ate at two different restaurants. The first time we ordered the JungShik (dinner set) and the second we just ordered a jiggae (soup) to share. Both times we really enjoyed our meal. "
Nice tofu!! Great for vegetarian.,Freshly made soft tofu which I loved and this is great for vegetarians. Price was reasonable at $8-10 per dish.
The Place to be if you LOVE Tofu,"Menus are in English. Although our waitress didn't speak English, she kindly got the host who was able to help us and recommend things. We got the Tofu set which same with tofu soup, two fish dishes cooked different ways, a nice, large piece of tofu, and a bunch of sides, all for 28,000 won (more than enough for two people).The restaurant was busy, but spacious and the food was delicious. I am not a huge fan of tofu, but its a must if you find yourself on this side of Korea.We had a great experience here and could not recommend it enough."
Wonderful Tofu,"Sundubu means fresh tofu in Korea. The best place to try their special version of tofu here in Gangneung. Since it locates near the sea, the best ingredient to make the tofu is sea water instead of usually plaster.The ""Chodang"" tofu tastes just wonderful, though it looks different than those normal tofu.Must try if you have the chance to visit Gangneung."
The good surprise of the trip,"I'm clearly not a tofu fan but since it's Gangneug specialty we wanted to try it. We asked the taxi driver to bring us to a famous sundubu place and he brougth us there (check the picture). When you enter, you notice a lot of korean celebrities pictures and broadcasting channels signs, I guess it was a famous place. Apparently they use sea water which makes it really tasty.The sundubu tasted amazing (Jambong Sundubu and Cho Sundubu) and the side dishes were amazing. One of the greatest surprise we had in Gangneung. The village is close to the beach so I would recommend to catch a taxi and to ask him to bring you to ""sundubu maheul"" or ask for ""sundubu matchib""."
