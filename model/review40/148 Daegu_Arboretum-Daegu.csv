Awesome mum festival ,"The mum festival was between second & third week & weekend of November. The color is very bright, pretty & beautiful. Each of item's design is fabulous. Also, you can enjoy walking on the paths & seeing the changed color leaves. There are a couple of classic & historic houses & a pond. "
"Relaxing, peaceful and beautiful","I went to the Arboretum on a summer day, it was hot but when I arrived it was raining. It would be beautiful in Autumn and Spring I think. It was wonderful to see in the rain when it was so lush and green. I spent about two hours wandering around. If you like nature but aren't up for a hike, this is a great place to go to just relax and enjoy fresh air, peace and quiet. It is wheelchair and pram accessible with parking facilities, paved pathways and plenty of wheelchair accessible bathrooms. I used the non-accessible bathrooms and they were clean and well maintained."
Spring Cherry Blossoms,"Since the cherry blossoms only last about a week, we headed to the Daegu Arboretum to appease our visual receptors. With the additions of Tulips, Poppies, and other assorted early-blooming varieties of garden visuals, we were pleasantly surprised. There are beautiful water features throughout, and the parks' pinnacle is a traditional Korean Garden. Plenty of Asian-customary raised picnic ""decks"", so bring a lunch if visiting with a group of friends or family - since we're just a couple, we were able to view most of the park in under 2 hours. "
Nice place to walk around but nothing special.,You can spend a couple of hours wandering around the place to fill in time.There are various flower beds that need attention.Some glass houses that are just ok.I woudn't recommend going out of you way unless you wanted to fill in time.Free to enter.
Chrysanthemum Festival,"I happened to be here in early November while the Chrysanthemum Festival was taking place and it was absolutely beautiful! There were many sculptures made from Chrysanthemum flowers, so I highly recommend going there when they are in bloom. It was also fall, so the beautiful orange, yellow, and red leaves were everywhere. It was absolutely breathtaking. "
It’s very pleasant experience ,It’s been wonderful experience to be here Very friendly people Food is good Enjoyed a lot Hotels in Downtown are good 
Very nice place with great autumn colors,I visited the place in the beginning of the autumn. The leaves started to change colors already. It was a great time to visit this place. The park offers many paths to visit many different places with lots of different vegetation. There are also few greenhouses where one can see tropical or desert vegetation. There is no entrance fee and the place is great for families.
lovely in Spring and Autumn,It's reclaimed land and definitely an underrated beauty of a destination. You can take out of town guests there before or after going to Biseulsan for Korean traditional food. It's free but parking can be a beast during peak foliage beauty times.recommended to drive there.
Daegu Arboretum is the first of its kind in South Korea,"Its the first landfill project in the country to be reconstructed as an eco-friendly park. The park is almost a square mile and includes more than 1,000 varieties of trees, wild flowers, cacti, medicinal herbs, bonsai, ponds, fountains and groves of bamboo and fruit trees. There are several trails and grassy areas for picnics from which to enjoy the seasonal changes in the park.Spend a day at the Daegu Arboretum. It's a reclaimed LANDFILL that until recently stored more than 4.1 million tons of garbage. It had been abandoned for 10 years prior to construction. Now the roots of thousands of native trees is working to effectively compost the waste and return this once unusable space into a place where locals can learn about how they can help protect the environment, enjoy a picnic or a cup of coffee as they stroll for one end of the park to the other."
Lovely on an Autumn's Day,"I went to the Daegu Arboretum for their annual Fall chrysanthemum festival. It was busy with people, but the flower exhibitions were spectacular! The arboretum itself has lots of lovely paths to stroll around. Nearby there are lots of cafes and resturants. A great day out in you are in Daegu."
Only place in Daegu where to get the hottest Jalapeños,"Nice place to walk around. What's bothering a bit is the music blaring from hidden loudspeakers, because you know Ajeossis on the mountain also bring their speakers everywhere and nature alone is too creepy for Asians."
Beautiful and well-maintained!,"We visited the Daegu Arboretum in Autumn and the leaves were just beginning to change colour. It was absolutely beautiful! Apart from the well-maintained garden, there were also a number of picnic areas for those of you wishing linger in the beauty of the arboretum and have a bite to eat! "
Beautiful in Autumn,"Very well maintained, picturesque arboretum. We visited in Autumn and the leaves had just started changing color - beautiful."
Perfectly nice place to spend an afternoon.,"I was taken here by some Korean friends and we ended up having a nice little walk / hike through some very pretty trees and flowers. It's pretty much what you'd expect from an arboretum, but the place is very well maintained and welcoming. There is plenty of parking and also a bus stop right outside the entrance. I've been meaning to make it back here when I've got the time."
Amazing space,"This beautiful arboretum was built on an old landfill site. It is a magnificent of space. There are many different gardens, including a traditional Korean garden. I visited during the chrysanthemum festival. It was spectacular."
A nice big arboretum,"Lots of plants, trees and flowers. No admission fee and lovely to drop by when the weather is good. Lots of moms come here with their young children as well. Besides this it is not that special. :)"
Daegu Arboretum Spring Break 2016,Beautiful place to visit. Eat before you go or bring food. Plenty of spots to sit down and rest. Probably best to visit in May when all the flowers are in bloom. 
Nature walks,"- In winter not much to see Only few small greenhouse : tropical , rare flower , bongsai and cactus greenhouse - dint have stores to buy the seed of plants - Far to get a taxi"
Great spot!,Excellent arboretum. Many things to see. They take a lot of time and care to make sure this spot can be enjoyed throughout the year. It is large and you can easily spend a few hours walking around. It also has some indoor greenhouses to tour.
Extensive Place to Visit,"First, getting there without a car is difficult since it is a mile from the nearest train station. There is a bus from the train station so best to take that. You will need to save your energy to tour the place. "
Daegu Arboretum,You'll need a few hours to see the entire place. Start early as it closes at 6 p.m. my favourite time was around 5 p.m. when the sun starts setting and the light all around is golden. The hills around look wonderful too.There are very well laid out gardens and some areas that are park like. I heard birds singing in the trees too. Visit the hot houses as well to see the many tropical blooms and fruit trees. The scents tingle the senses.
Beautiful Flowers and Trees,This is a wonderful place for an amateur botanist or nature lover. There are so many different kinds of plants and trees along pretty paths. The is a greenhouse devoted to cacti and lovely ponds throughout the area.
Very nice,Beautiful flowers and plants. There is a cactus greenhouse that is very interesting. Nice trails to walk around on. Some nice fountains and ponds. A very relaxing day. There are some special events there at different times throughout the year. 
Great natural space!,"I visited five years ago and wanted to return because it was such a beautiful, peaceful place. This time it was filled with the energy of hundreds of very small children, which was also nice. While some areas seem less maintained, others were even more spectacular. To reach the arboretum I took exit 3 from Daegok station and followed the signs, easier then the last time when there were no signs and I had a rough map. There is a small lunch spot in the park and I had odeng, crepe like food on sticks soaked in broth. It was very good. There is a nice boardwalk that follows the left edge of the park and rather than return through the park, I exited at gate #3 and took the trail up to a ridge. I went left and left again and eventually reached gate #2 that led back into the arboretum. I should have taken it or at least taken a left in a fork further along the trail. I try to have a mini adventure everyday and finding my way back to the metro after landing far from the arboretum or Daegok station fulfilled my goal. I would have liked to explore the trails more thoroughly, but while there were many signs and trail markers, there was no information in English. If you appreciate nature I can not imagine that you would not enjoy spending time at the arboretum. The flowers and plants in the greenhouses are spectacular as are the trees and plants covering the grounds. It is nice to see groups of locals picnicking and enjoying the park. I recommend exploring the trails behind as well, just stay found."
"Arboretum, but also the trails behind it","The arboretum itself is a bit underwhelming, though it is somewhat reminiscent of the Stellenbosch gardens in South Africa. What's really excellent is the network of trails behind the arboretum that wind through the mountains and give excellent views of the city and the mountains around it. "
Excellent example of urban trash turned to treasure,"The arboretum was built on a landfill of trash during the build up of Daegu. The arboretum now is one of the best places in Daegu to escape the cement and see nature and its beauty. All the various gardens, flowers, plants and nature is a great reason to come to the arboretum, oh wait. no, even better it is free!"
Green all around you,"It is indeed a nice place to visit while staying in Daegu. So many varieties of plants all around you, Also you can see different types of cactus plants there which I loved the most. Whenever you go there it will certainly comfort your eyes. The entry of this place is free. Nice place to visit with your family."
Comfortable and Free,"I took my visiting family to the Arboretum and was greatly impressed by the pure amount of things to see.....it's an arboretum so you don't expect rides....we went the third day of Chuseok and there were lots of people, but it was still calm and peaceful and packed with cool exhibits.....my family particularly enjoyed the tropical fruit plant exhibition. I would definitely go again."
Pleasant green space - whatever the season.,My son and his family live nearby. We have often visited the Arboretum and know it in all (4!) seasons. This is a low key but pleasant place to visit and have a stroll. Most people don't seem to walk far so if you keep going it gets much quieter. Lots of byways to explore. Be sure to visit the bonsai house as well as the hot house. To me it is most beautiful in mid-autumn when the maples are turning. As a keen English gardener I now know where many of the staples of my English garden originated.
Never-Ending Plant-Life,"This arboretum has a little of most plants: cactus gardens, roses, bonsais, flowering trees, etc. It is a nice place to have a picnic, walk & get coffee or go jogging."
beautiful in spring,"perfect for a picnic or late afternoon stroll. the gardens are very well kept, the ablution facilities are always clean. its great to get away from the hussle of the city and relax for a while in this beautiful garden"
Come if you live here,"If you live in Daegu, it's worth coming to visit for an afternoon. It's not worth traveling to if you are in town on vacation though. It gets really crowded on sunny weekends. Most people don't go much farther than about halfway through the park, so if you keep walking back, it'll mostly be deserted. Besides the cactus house, there's nothing all that interesting to see. But it is nice to be surrounded by nature in the big city.I don't know what, if any, bus goes here, but if you don't have a car, take line #1 (red line) to Daegok or Jincheon and catch a cab.No beer allowed."
Best place to escape the city,Daegu's best kept secret! Free entrance! Little difficult to get there by subway. Easiest to get to by driving or cab. Great story of how a dump turned into an urban park.
"Nature, photography and picnics.","Good range of plants. They have a ""cactus desert"" which looks neat. There are quite a few things to see. The have great spots for photography. One spot looks like a little fairy tale garden. It's an excellent place for a weekend picnic. "
Not worth the trip,This can hardly be called an arboretum. It's completely underwhelming. This is not what a Westerner would think of a botanical garden. This is more like a park.
Nice for picnic,"It takes about 50 minutes by car from Gyeongsan to Daegu Arboretum, or take subway from Sawol Station and transfer into Line 1 and take off at Daegok Station. If you decide to take a walk, then it will be around 20 minutes to get into Daegu Arboretum.This place is a large botanical garden, with many spot to do a picnic. A good place for family, couple even group of friends to hang out here on weekend, enjoying sun and meals. Aside from many land to open up your picnic mat, Daegu Arboretum has plenty plants and glass house to be seen. The landscape is flat, so it will suit for any age, and also easy to bring your baby stroller."
