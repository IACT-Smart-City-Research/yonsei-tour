Walk a little further on a friday!!!,"At first finding a safe way to get on the bridge seemed impossible but as always the lovely residents if Seoul aided us. The experience was awesome. We arrived onto the bridge shortly before sunset, the plan was to watch all the bridges light up. It didn't quite work out that way. Going back to the bridge. The views from here are stunning. It's crazy to think you have cars driving at full speed on one side then the stunning view of the Han river on the other. We walked across the entire bridge to yeouido hangang park. It was perfect timing because friday evening they have a night market that's open with amazing food options and lots of music festivals. Young talent appear and play near the riverside. It's just magical. The sign may have seen better days but the park speaks for itself."
Mapo,"Been through this bridge several times. In the middle of Yongsan and Mapo districts, offer a nice view of Seoul"
