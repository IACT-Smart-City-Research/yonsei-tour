Impressive. ,"Nice wood construction and differing building shapes from the normal temples around here. Particularly the octagon pavilion. The laying figures are also not seen often in Korea (more reminiscent of S. E. Asia). Highly recommend hiking Manroesan (trails connect to here, that summit is >600m, maybe 1.5h away on foot, tallest in the county). "
