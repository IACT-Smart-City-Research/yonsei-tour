Teasty,"Went and spot on my way to the capital, Great area to go, and plenty of places toy can choose, same for the prices"
Too pricey these days,Not as popular as it once was and far too pricey. Baekhyeon-dong Cafe Street 10 mins away by car provides a better alternative and more atmosphere. 
Fancy and expensive,"Trendy café street looking like luxurious blvd. of Gangnam-gu.If money isn't your concern and you're staying nearby, good to spend time here."
"Many places to eat, shop and chat with friends and family ","Many places to eat, shop and chat with friends and family. You can enjoy a number of different types of food from virtually all the world such as from India, Thai, Japan, China, Italy, Spain, and US."
Not worth going out of your way,"Maybe it used to be better, but these days it is just a short street with the odd cafe and western restaurant. We ended up eating in burger king and walked along the stream/river to Sunae station area to grab a coffee. Perhaps I was expecting too much or looking in the wrong place, but I much preferred Sunae for food and coffee options."
Jeongja,4.5/5 would be the perfect rating. I gave it 5 because is beautiful should i say. Lot of coffee places and cozy restaurants. Some boutiques for shopping as well. Outside Seoul so there isn't much noise around. I saw this as a hidden gem to be honest. Would probably go back.
Nothing to write home about,Filled with many Japanese Izakaya restaurants and other expensive eateries. I would rather visit Jukjeon Cafe street. I would not recommend a visit to this street.
It is nice place to hang out but expensive,"This area is safe and has many cozy places to drink some coffee and teas. But the price is a little more expensive than other coffee shops. But it is worth to go to date with your bf or gf.아기자기하고 예쁜 카페, 음식점, 와인바가 있어서 좋아요. 조금 비싼 게 흠이지만 여친 혹은 남친이랑 데이트하기엔 강추인 곳입니다. 주차는 길가에 해야해서 주말엔 차 안가져가는게 좋은 것도 단점이에요 ㅠㅠ"
Just a gathering of large franchise cafes.,"The title explains it all, since this is trip advisor i score it very low as there is literally nothing to do in this area for tourists, no local culture and horrible parking. Worst of all expensive for very average food or dining experience, if you are looking for an ""experience"" omit this attraction from your list."
Street of Cafe and restaueant in Seongnam,There are many mixed fusion style of restaueant and cafe. It fun to look around but they are quite pricy.
Quiet Place Away From Crowded Seoul,"Personally, I find it's a great place worth the visit. Abit far away from Seoul City thou but this place is filled with cosy cafes/restaurant surrounded by residential area. If you are someone who enjoy quiet moment, this is the right place to visit."
Just A Street,Nothing special. It used be to more decorative but now many stores lost they distinct atmosphere and mood.
Meh...,"Eaten in about a dozen different restaurants and cafés in Pangyo Café Street over the last 3 years. More for convenience and as an invited guest than by choice. Lots of the places do an acceptable job of the dishes they serve but mostly it's overpriced and underwhelming gastronomically. i.e.: B-Grade ""brunch"" places serving reheated canned baked-beans, miracle whip topped pancakes any muddy water that serves as 'coffee'. A few French/ Italian and Thai~Vietnamese places try hard to make you think your in a cosmopolitan culinary corner....but again, the focus is too much on appearance, decor and being ""hip"" (chopping boards and mason jars etc in place of decent, functional crockery). Definitely not terrible - you could do worse, and the surrounds are pretty good: plenty of open verandahs and people watching opportunities (car enthusiasts can watch 20 something year old spoiled brats rev the Porsche/ Audi/ BMW/ Maserati/ Mini Cooper etc mummy and daddy bought them)."
Decent place to get food and take a walk,"A quiet neighborhood shopping center. Not many people are here so it is quiet. There are decent restaurants in the area that are never busy,"
Cafe Street,Cafe Street in Jeongja has many wonderful restaurants to choose from. It's really not a place to do anything but eat so go there hungry! It's a nice area to walk in and explore a bit as well.
Reminds me of home,This area reminds me of my neighborhood back home in the Srates..not so crowded and buildings are fairly new with great modern feel. Lots of restaurants and coffee shops to try. Theres also a nice small river across the main road to walk around. Close to main bus stops and subway stations...i dont recommend driving as parking is quite expensive.
Cosy place to hang out,"Had been to this place on a very chilly eveningLoved the cute coffee shops, cosy environment and variety of restaurants offering delicious food"
"Atmosphere, Yummy Food, and Boutiques","Atmosphere, Yummy Food, and Boutiques great place to spend and afternoon or evening. Has a variety of food types and is fairly easy to order. Safe and fun environment. "
