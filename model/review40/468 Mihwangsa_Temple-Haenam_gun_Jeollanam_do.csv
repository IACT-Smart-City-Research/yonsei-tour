Great Temple Stay Destination ,"My wife and I spent one night here on temple stay. It’s a great experience. One participates in the typical rituals of the monastery, including prayers and meals. There’s also a tea ceremony with a monk. We were lucky enough to be there for the first snow of the year, which happened to be super heavy. The monks put me to work (working meditation) sweeping and shoveling snow. It’s a really beautiful place. As the photos and other reviews make clear. There’s also a hike to the top of the mountain (one can see Jindo and Wando from there, I guess). But I was advised not to because of the snow. The food is excellent. It’s all vegan. A lot of different flavors. I think they served us a local curry type, that they specialize in. There is English support there (thanks Chajae!), so those who don’t speak Korean need not shy away. "
Nice landscape,"It's time to be silent and watch this temple for a certain amount of time without doing anything. In doing so, we can feel this temple more deeply. Then we can realize there is no temple and even there is no me. That's when we are getting out of ourselves in our boundary."
"Serenity, Compassion and Kindness","I completed 7 nights and 8 days silent meditation called ""Chamsaramui Hyanggi"", roughly translated into English as ""Scent of your True Being"". Mihwangsa Temple is one of the most beautiful and serene places I have ever been to. The staff are very kind and gentle, the head monk was very wise and one can see that he's enlightened, the food was delicious and healthy. The meditation sessions were strenuous; however, one is taught how to properly eat a meal and conduct a tea ceremony as well. It's a must for a person/family if you are interested in a Korean Buddhist Temple stay."
"Eat, pray, and fall in love with yourself","It was one of those trips that I needed to get away from the real world and be with myself and listen to my body and my mind. I heard of the temple from Mom and she said it's close to southern most tip of Korea an it will be very beautiful.Getting to this place is not the easiest, however it was worth every second of the bus ride. Local cab driver was very nice.We got there and staff helped us to the rooms and it was very nice. (You will be sleeping on the floor on top of a thick cotton ""mattress""- it's actually super comfortable). Remember you are at a temple not at Ritz. You are also given a temple clothes to wear for the duration of the stay and it was nice to wake up each morning and not think about what you needed to wear.First evening we had a dinner that was super delicious, joined a prayer that was so calming, and had a tea ceremony with the monks. The evening ended with full moon stroll to wrap up the day. It was a good way to settle in.Next day, we were woken up by ""mok-tak,"" a wooden gong before the sun was up. We took silent stroll and joined another AM prayer. Our group got to hit the bell that was in the courtyard. Watching the sun come up was amazing.I can go on about the experience- we got there in may right before Buddah's birthday celebration and it was GREAT! Made lanterns to decorate the place!Overall,I didn't want to leave, it was so nice to just be and not worry about anything but to just be with the nature. I felt like my soul was healed from the city life and the rat race.I would go back in a heart beat and next time stay a little longer. Food was amazing and the hospitality really made you feel the love they teach about.P.s I also went to 4-5 other temples on this trip and it felt more like a business and they have lost the true teachings of Buddhism. But this old gem was true to the teachings and everyone there was amazing!"
Temple Stay at Mihwangsa,"Our family of 2 adults and 3 teenagers stayed at this amazing temple in October. Just getting to the temple was a wonderful adventure. Learning to bow properly, having meals together and taking tea with the head monk were some highlights. We also hiked up to the top of the mountain-not easy but we were rewarded by the beautiful view. Even the views from the temple complex were spectacular. We were shown to our sleeping quarters-historical and private and given simple, comfortable clothing to wear for our stay. Peaceful and interesting experience that we will never forget. Can't wait to return!"
Beautiful and peaceful,"I visited Mihwangsa temple for the day and had a temple lunch at the shop there.This is a beautiful temple. Very very peaceful.When we arrived we met a lady who was waiting for some guests for a temple stay and she gave us a small tour of the temple.The lunch at the shop was delicious: rice wrapped in lotus leaf, a soup and salad and vegetables from the garden. We only stayed a couple of hours but I would consider returning to this temple for a temple stay. Such a relaxing place surrounded by beautiful mountains."
Absolutely perfect,"I did a templestay here and I loved it. The location is beautiful and peaceful, the people are incredibly nice and there is no pressure to go to all the rituals (and also lots of free time to relax). I was also lucky to be able to go there during the Gwaebul ceremony, which happens every year.My entire trip around Korea, including my templestay at Mihwangsa, is described here: http://ttlgawift.weebly.com/around-korea-in-15-days.html ."
"The perfect retreat, vacation, experience","I just finished my temple stay at Mihwangsa. I must say it's one of the best experiences I've had while traveling. You are free to explore as much as you want. You can learn about meditation, Buddhism and also be in contact with nature. The temple is beautiful plus very well located. The sunset is one of the best I've seen anywhere. Also, Jajae, (who is in charge of the temple stay,) is the nicest, warm hearted person that you will meet. I really recommend this temple stay for anyone, anytime and no matter from where you are."
