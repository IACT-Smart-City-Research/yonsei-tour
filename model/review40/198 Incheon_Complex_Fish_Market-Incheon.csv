Wonderful experience: very friendly people,"The Incheon Fish Market is a great place to visit if, like me, you have at least 6 hours of layover. It is about 45 minutes drive from Incheon International Airport (meter-taxi will charge about USD 30 each way), and you will need at least an hour and a half to visit this absolutely gorgeous and well organized fish market complex, buy some fresh seafood at a stall and have it cooke at one of the restaurants within the complex. Few vendors speak English. make sure you agree on the price as seafood in South Korea can get extremely expensive. Well worth a visit."
A bit smelly,"We did hundred of pictures, big choice of fish and fish products. Smell is very strong, be prepared for it."
Never seen a place like this before,For a seafood market was surprised at the cleanliness of the stalls and surrounds. It has so many stalls selling various products both fresh and smoked and various other methods I've not seen before. A wonderful display to look at as you wander around the place. Was interested in the cooking and eating on the spot but didn't sample as I was unsure of the product
Real unique experience,"We had only one night at Incheon and the hotel staff suggested to go down to the fish market for a walk and some dinner!What a treat! This is the real deal! All live fresh fish , hundreds of stalls of it and many places where they just cook it for you to order ...from the water to the table ...simply unique!Not to be missed if you like seafood!"
fresh fish but beware of cleanliness,If you are looking for a place to be for fresh fish go here .open every day . There are many different types of fish and crustaceans to choose from . But I think if you want to eat there just be aware that our clean standards are much higher than what you will see there. I bought fried shrimp and squid from a stall and later watched them drop a couple of pieces on the ground and put them on a tray so that they could be sold later . Imagine all the water and dirt. All in all if you want to see a fish market and you have time drop by.
Huge complex for seafood,"This is a huge complex with hundreds of stalls selling all sorts of seafood, fresh and dried.The place is very clean for a seafood market as there are workers working tirelessly clearing and cleaning the walkway.We were amazed with the varieties of local seafood from octopus, stingrays, shell fishes, monk fish, flatheads to giant groupers. Fish can be purchased, cut and eaten on the spot.Interesting place to visit."
