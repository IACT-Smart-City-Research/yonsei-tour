You had me at free,"The museum had several parts closed down for renovation. I was led to believe they had some western art, which peaked my interest. I caught the last day of the Eternal Narcissist exhibit by Chun Kyung-ja, and was grateful for the exposure to someone I wasn't familiar with and to learn about her. Even though my expectations weren't met, I was not disappointed in the least. The grounds are lovely and the price was right!"
Great Place,"Amazing place to visit, very impressive. Great collection of arts and crafts which are laid down for us to admire. A must see!"
Finished my tour in 30 minutes ,"I wanted to check out a new place that I hadn't been to in Seoul. I found this place online and thought I would check it out. Positives: It's a short bus ride from Seoul National University Station and the admission is only W3,000. Also, the view from outside the museum was more interesting than what was inside it.Negatives: There was an exhibition of Kim Jong Yun art. There were some paintings, three-dimensional abstract rock sculptures, and regular sculptures of people. The only thing I liked were the sculptures of the people and I couldn't take pictures of them.It also took me a very short time to look through it. I was done in less than 30 minutes. "
