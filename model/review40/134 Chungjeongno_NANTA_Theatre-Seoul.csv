Must See,Its a very good show. Its very different from broad way shows of USA. Any tourist can understand it. Language is not a problem .Amazing performance by the artists.. The whole story is explained with orchestra by using kitchen utensils.The artists involve the audience also which makes it unique.
Very interesting ,You dont need to know korean to go there and the theatre is comfy and most the people that work there speak decent english to direct you. 
Fantastic! Not to be missed!,The highlight of my kids' holiday. They laughed from beginning till end. We appreciate the booster seats provided for kids. Row F where we sat was not elevated. The row behind onwards would be better.
