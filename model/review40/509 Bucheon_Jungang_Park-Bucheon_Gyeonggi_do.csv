Fantastic picnic spot,"I went there on a Sunday late afternoon post lunch.in the month of May.I saw many families having an outing / picnic enjoying some music, snacks and Soju ,beer and makeoli . Some kind of village festival was being celebrated and there was a stage for some entertainment programmes."
