Good park beside Namhansanseong Fortress,"C ( 19.09.05 ) I visited this park after lunch for walk. I went there by back gate, it was hard to walk because the road is inclined steeply. But there's atmosphere and air was very good. Around back gate, there was gate ball and badminton arena, and well-managed. There had good mood, but inclined steeply. So I recommend to go there by front gate."
Good park to take stroll,This is a great park for a nice stroll and view of Pangyo/Hwangsong city. You can also see some Korean old culture and houses in the park. I would say this is a hidden gem of the area.
