Beautiful Historical site,"Tucked away in Naju, we found this place with a tour group. We went at night after dinner, so it was dark, but all lit up. It was quite beautiful. It used to be the governor's mansion. Not much to see, but interesting to historical buffs and artists. The paint-work is amazing. The old town drum and pavilion nearby are also beautiful. Definitely worth it if you're nearby and like the historical Korean architecture and artistry."
