Overall a satisfying experience ,"We stayed here for 5 nites this time for our annual ski trip. 2.5hours drive from Incheon airport. We picked the Green Condo as we wanted the whole family of 4 to stay together. We would have to book two rooms if we chose the hotel. The ski resort is huge. With hotel, condo, villa and youth hostel. We picked the room of 99m2 which had one room with two beds and another room with tatami. With a small kitchen we were able to cook some simple breakfast. No room service, not much toiletries for condo. 5 mins walk to the ski rentals/lift ticket office. Good mix of slopes of different levels. Snow honestly not very good this year cos not cold and no new snow. Quite icy. Nite ski was good as no queue for lifts. English speaking ski / snowboard coaches available and friendly. Waterpark, bowling, spa n sauna, arcade avail. The waterpark is only good for very small kids. Don’t waste money if your kids are older. Can go to the sauna to enjoy hot-spring which is much cheaper. Bowling is good value of money. Restaurants ok. More choices if you walk out of the resort. 5-10 mins walk. Facilities overall i would say excellent in terms of convenience and variety but cleanliness and service level average. Would be good if staff can speak a bit more english. "
Excellent Olympic Size Ski Resort,"Top of the class ski resort where the Winter Olympic was held here recently. Ski track is very spacious, offering breathtaking view. Should spend the whole day here, at least."
Great place in Asia for kids to learn skiing,"We (European family with 6 and 4 yo) spent 1 week in PyeongChang over Christmas 2018 and had a fabulous holiday. Phoenix was for us logistically easier than Japan (Flew into Seoul Incheon and pre-booked a shuttle service to PyeongChang which took 2,5 hours). The kids took skilessons at the Foreigner Skischool and the resort provides ample beginner slopes, great fun!! My husband and I enjoyed the advanced slopes and were OK with the fact that the resort has only few slopes for us. Each kid went with their own instructor as level was uncomparable and there were not enough non-Korean kids to form a class. Compared to a week skiclass in Europe for kids, it is pricy as many Koreans take lessons by the hour and the price is calculated by just summing up hourly rates. Their development in 1 week was tremendous however and most importantly they had a lot of fun. We took lunch at the food court: choice of 6 dishes, affordable and more than enough, it is quick but has little atmosphere. We enjoyed the americano coffee at the NY coffee and hotdog truck at the foot of the slopes. There is no such thing as a village bus service. You have to walk or take a taxi if your accomodation is not right at the foot of the mountain where the few restaurants and bars are. Not ideal when you have little kids as a bit isolated to our appartment in the morning and evenings, however the price difference between our appartment in Story residence and the hotels at the foot of the mountain was a factor 1:4. All in all, great week of ski ☀️"
Well Maintained Ski Resort,"Phoenix Park is very well kept. The snow is mostly artificial but the grounds crew does a great job maintaining it. It can get icy. To me, the best thing is night boarding. 2200-0400. It helps saves time in your busy weekend schedule, but of course, it gets really cold at night. If you're looking for stuff to do or restaurants to go eat out at, good luck, because you're not going to find anything. The ski resort is basically located in the middle of nowhere. During my first years living in Korea I had a season pass but now would rather go to High1 Resort because it snows there often and has a bit more to offer outside the resort. Phoenix Park is small, but that means you get a lot of runs in. It can be crowded but the lift lines move quickly. Panorama Slope is my favorite."
Good and clean resort,It was my first time at a ski resort in Korea. Apparently there were many choices available but we were brought to this one by our tour guide. The hotel was just located below the ski resort and it was easy for us. The rental of the ski shoes was also done within the compound. Overall a nice experience and great views at the top!
Went during the 2018 PyeongChang Olympic time frame,The Phoenix Snow Park is surrounded by good places to ski and it now joins the Pantheon of Ski Resort venues that have hosted an Olympics.
Ski in Korea. Tips for 1st timer.,"1) Fly to Seoul.2) Head to Seoul Station. Take KTX to Pyeongchang or rent a car. The road can be slippery after snowfall. Take 4wd if you plan to drive around Pyeongchang.3) Best to stay in the ski resort to maximise time on the slope. We stay at the nearby AirBnB.4) There are 3 ski resorts around Pyeongchang. We recommend Phoenix due to trainer availability. *Don’t pay for the ski park entry yet, It’s for the lift. You probably not ready for Beginner slope on the 1st day. * Take 2 hours class. It’s worth it even if this is just 1 off - bucket list thing. The class make the next 2-4 hours on the slope more enjoyable.5) Schedule a class before arrival or in our case we just walk in and book 2 hours afternoon class for 5 people. If you don’t speak Korean, you have to book private class with 1 trainer.6) Come early, take gondola to the mountain top. Have some hot chocolate, throw some snowballs before the class.7) Allow 1 hour for prep to pick up ski set - ski, shoes and poles. Helmet & goggles are optional but they keeps your head warm. * The shoes are uncomfortable. The ski set are heavy.8) Today class is about how to slow down (without falling down too much ).There you go. That’s pyeongchang 1 day. Scheduled it to happen "
Phoenix Park Skiing and Hiking,"I'm a skier, but did not ski this trip. I went for the Olympics and saw two events at Phoenix Park (also known as Bokwang Snow Park) a ski resort in South Korea. It is located in the township of Bongpyeong-myeon, in the county of Pyeongchang. Note: Pyeongchang is a county, not a city. The area was all decked out for the Olympics, but the mountain still looked inviting with a variety of ski slopes to entice beginners to upper intermediates. New hotel construction in the area will offer ""front door"" service to chairlifts. Other accommodations in the area are readily available and numerous ski rental places. Note: Koreans seem to all rent skis, not own. By KTX train, the nearest station is Pyeongchang with easy taxi service to hotels and the resort. The resort also has a bowling alley, ""food court"", spa, billard parlor and although closed in the winter, there is a big water park. The winter visit was great, but I'd also enjoy seeing the area in a different season."
Great experience ,We visited this place in early March 2018 Most of the events for the ski had ended. We had great enjoyment as we were the only visitors there at this time. 
Olympic experience,"We went to watch the Ski half pipe and of all the events we watched this was definitely one of our favourites. I am not sure whether the Olympic facilities will remain after the Olympics,, but I sincerely hope they do to provide young Koreans with the inspiration to follow in the footsteps of their successful athletes. "
snowboarding extraganza,"My friends and I, plus my 2 boys, enjoyed the slopes of Phoenix Snow Park very much. I like the way things are organised, with 3 different timings for the ski pass so that we can plan our schedule. It's my 5th ski trip and it was the 1st time that I got to snowboard at night, and I really relished the experience of having fresh snow and enjoying the quiet slopes at night. "
Had my first experience in skiing,"The Park has a long slop for beginner. I am pleased to have my first ski experience here. However the snow is not so ""powder-like' on the first day. The snow is more ""powder-like'' on the second and third day which I believe it was made by the machines instead.The park provides 3 sessions for skiers: morning, afternoon and night. As I am not a morning person, I chose the combination of afternoon and night, the lift pass is only slightly higher than the other options.The bus schedules from Seoul are clearly stated in their website and you can make the reservation online.The ski rental and the price for the lift pass is much cheaper than the price list provided in their website. There are some people (reseller) near the ticketing and would love to help you to buy the lift pass in a cheaper price. The ski world also provides ski cloth and ski equipment for rental. However the instructor for foreigners is amazing expensive (240,000W for 1:1, 2hrs). If you will spend a few days for skiing, just go to a ski rental shop outside and bargain a better price. You can hire a instructor in the rental shop outside also, despite I doubt they have a licence or are certificated, the instructor is enough for me who is a beginner. The lesson fee is 100,000 for 1:1, 2hrs."
Nice slope for beginners,We had ski instructor for training (1.5hrs) followed by going up via ski lift and ski down the slope.The slope is gentle and suitable for beginner.Would loved to back again.
Slopes mostly closed,"Lots of construction going on for the upcoming Winter Olympics 2018. Most slopes are closed for them to construct stands and stages. Rentals are still on and the ski lifts leading to Mont Blanc is in operation. Panorama slope is a beauty but it gets really crowded especially weekends. For dinner eats, you might want to head down to the White Cabin Hotel across the road where there the a little joint on the left."
Ski Resort,Pyeongchang olympic 2018 venue. Fanstatic view and total relaxing resort with ski and spa too. Quite easy accesd from seoul with only 3 hours bus ride to the resort. 
"No need to rise from the Ashes, Phoenix is where it's at....","Another great weekend on the slopes at Phoenix, got into a Kpop concert, and had a spa day... This time I did the night skiing and we literally were on the slopes till 1am and they were still running the lifts, after we left. If you are thinking about skiing in Korea I would highly recommend staying at Phoenix, it's the closest thing they have to ski in/ski out, its a small moutain but more than ample for 90% of skiers/boarders, and they have some stuff to keep you entertained. Also there is a great bar ""Heineken Lounge,"" guess what they serve...."
nice ski resort,It was our first time to visit a ski resort and we enjoyed our experience there. We didnt avail of their ski lessons bec my kids just wants to play with the snow and still we had a great time. The place is huge. It is also where the Winter Olympics will be held on 2018. They have a gondola ride but take note that it's only open until 4pm. They also have tubing experience for kids. We love the ski sled. There are a lot of restaurants or food stalls.The place is quiet far if you will be coming from Seoul.
Ski ,"An excellent place to have fun, with your friends, family, also solo. Very organized and cheap, you're not gonna regret it ..."
Ski lessons,"Well, lets start with my low points: we ended up getting a private tutor from off park for my 5 and 3 year old boys. We got to go down the slopes about 3 times during their 2 hr lesson and then extended another 2 hrs. She did great! When we asked about lessons from their award winning ski school, we were told that they had to be 11...ELEVEN to do group lessons. Even though our kids speak Korean... The only way they'd even take the 5 year old was 1:3 or smaller. How much was it? 234,000 for 1:1, 274,000 for 1:2 and didn't quite get to the numbers for 1:3. We paid about $200 for the private person. Their lifts slow down WAY too much at the tops. You almost can't get momentum to get off. I'm not a great skier but I am a decent one. They had only like 7 menu choices for sit down food during the high season! They need a ""magic carpet"" to get over to the ski school are and small beginner run. It's too far to walk with kids and uphill so skiing isn't an option. They need a money exchange in the mail building. Good things: they have plenty of beginner and intermediate runs! They had decently sized lockers. Plenty of seating. Good equipment and great ski patrol! Friendly staff. "
"Limited ski runs and facilities, food very poor ","Our first visit to this world and Olympic ski and board freestyle resort, our visit is 5 days before the World Cup event, ski runs were well kept and sign posted well, very little intermediate and high level slopes, good for beginners. Very few places to eat and the food in Food Palace is poor, locals ate else where, no apre ski at all. The people who work here are good natured and friendly but not the skiing experience we were expecting."
"Wonderful ski slopes, great for beginners / intermediates","We have been to Alpensia and Vivaldi Park before and Phoenix Park provided the most variety of beginners slopes. We registered the kids for lessons with the ""Foreigner Ski School"", one of the highlights of the trip. The contact in charge, Isaac Choi, spoke perfect English and provided helpful guidances on all fronts. The coaches also spoke good English; we were lucky to be given a lady from Russia, Lisa, was very hilarious and she took really good care of the kids. Full day lessons for two kids costed around KRW440,000, which was similar to other ski resorts. Great lunch options, hot dogs on one of the portable trucks in the middle of the ski resort next to the gondola station was extremely yummy. ""Sparrow"" was a good warm up for everyone. Other easy green slopes include ""Dodo"" and ""Penguin"". After which, you can try the ""Panorama"" and ""Kiwi"", to step up the challenge. For more advanced skiers, ""Valley"" would be a good run. Gondola takes a long time to go up so I preferred taking the different chairlifts at different points. Unfortunately the accommodation around the resort was full so we had to stay further out and drive. Suggest to book rooms and the hotel you want early. Paris Baguette was a good place for breakfast and Domino Pizza always good after a long day of skiing. We also tried the Blue Canyon Water Park (Indoor) which the kids loved, especially sitting in the outdoor hot pools (38 degrees +) with snow falling down on your face."
Great Ski resort for Beginners,"Four days of great skiing with my family. Resort is huge with Green slopes a plenty (6) for beginners. Kids loved the Green Panaroma course with good length of 2.4 km. The Blue courses feel slightly easier than other resorts so, this is a good place to build confidence. It can get rather crowded over the weekend, do plan on starting the day early and break for meals off-regular hours to avoid the jam. There is also night skiing, an experience we are planning to try on our next visit. Remember to return the Ski passes as they will refund the deposit for issuing the pass in cash.Food was rather expensive in the hotel and Ski House. So we visited the row of shops directly across the road from the Ski House and found ourselves a nice Korean restaurant serving great Ginseng chicken and slightly up the road a good BBQ place. Much better food and attractive prices.Our room at the Condominium was comfortable for 4. Heated floors so, a neat feature to have after a day in the snow. Kitchenette and tableware available, handy to rustle up ramen and hot beverages. It is walking distance to the Ski House but, not enjoyable if you have forgotten some stuff in the room after gearing up. Only nuisance was Front counter staff being rather sullen and not all are conversant with English.Overall a great place for beginner to intermediate skiers. We will return!"
bad front counter experience ,"though hotel room had a nice view of ski slope , but hotel front counter staff 's service was bad and replied my questions with black face and they were not able to speak basic english . "
First Time Going to a Ski Resort,"Overall, I would say that this an Good Resort. It's a huge place, has a hotel, restaurant, a mini market, a mini(?) mall with a complete rental ski equipment, and of course the ski area. I have nothing to complain with it, it has all of the tourist ever need. But, I do have some few things that I've noticed in the hotel during my visit there. First of all the hotel room is big and comfortable but the TV is still CRT for God's Sake. The Hotel's Restaurant is big and comfy with a super duper large variety of foods and drinks but the taste was okay, not bad but certainly not the best food I've ever had in Hotel. The Ski Area is nice and big, the ski rental equipment too, there is even a person always standby wearing ""Ask me any question"" sort of sign for noobs like me who is first time going to Korea for ski. We also received a greenish band that says something like ""I am a noob"". So yeah, this ski resort is really noob friendly for first timers, so I have nothing to complain about the ski area. I was lucky I go to Korea using a tour (not doing backpack on my own). I even got a free ski lesson from my tour guide Kim from The World Tourist Tour. It's really recommended and worth the experience"
Positive experience on my first time skiing,"Clean and scenic park, on this particular day with some native snow and some supplemental artificial snow. We arrived just before 9 and had about 2 hours before the crowds arrived. Lots of open slopes, well run lifts. My more experienced friends tell me the advanced slopes are not quite as aggressive as those in the Rockies. Lots of rentals available, including coats, if you just want to try the park for a day."
Stunning View from the restaurant and room,"Stay here only for a night as a part of the short trip visiting South Korea. We travel with infant of age one year and two months so did not get to experience much of the ski activities, such a pity.However, during breakfast we could see the lovely view from the restaurant, good breakfast available also.The bed anyhow is very dated, not comfortable. The toilet is not so clean in a part that is difficult to get to. The cleaning seems to be not so neat.Did not plan to return of such quality. However, it is just too short trip to judge.Ps. in the rush hour in the morning, waited for elevator for way tooooooooo long as it is always packed and full."
"Good resort, even for non-skiiers","We stayed just outside Phoenix Park (in Sweet Coop House) and visited Phoenix Park over 2 days. For one day, one of my group went skiing. The rest of us spent time at the resort. This note outlines what you can do at Phoenix Park other than skiing.The resort (mainly) consists of three areas: the skiing building / slopes; the main Phoenix Park hotel, and Center Plaza. In all three, there are food options.In the ski area, there is a Food Parade which serves (mostly Korean food). Above that there is a Lotteria burger outlet. There are also smaller food shops outdoor, and a few cafes. There is also a KFC stand (not restaurant) in the ski center. Downstairs, there is a convenience store, where if you really want, you can buy cup noodles and use the hot water dispenser. There are also microwaves there, in case you want ""tv dinners.""In the hotel there are many restaurants. But (as at Dec 2016), the most important aspect of the hotel is a counter which had the sign ""Foreigner 30% discount tickets available here"". If you don't have a Korean passport, take advantage of this to rent ski equipment / gear and pay for the ski lift etc. In the center plaza there are a few shops, video game arcade, convenience store, bowling alley, and many restaurants. The best would be the Paris Baguette bakery. There is also a full KFC restaurant there, along with many other Korean / local restaurants. Just outside Center Plaza is the aforementioned Water Theme Park.Just outside Phoenix Park (i.e. walk past the large car park, exit the compound) there are many shops (mostly ski equipment rentals, some restaurants, one supermarket etc.).So if some of you are going to Phoenix Park accompanying skiers but not actually skiing, it isn't really a terrible place to be stuck at. Prices of the restaurants are slightly more expensive than in Seoul but KFC and Paris baguette appear to be the same price as Seoul. This last section is about how to get to Phoenix Park on a budget.There are many ways to get to Phoenix Park, from Seoul or Incheon Airport by luxury coach, for example. These systems can be found on the Phoenix Park website, or also mentioned by other reviewers previously. They cost a lot more than what I will be describing next.We did our background work, and found that the cheapest way to get to Phoenix Park from Seoul was by inter-city bus. Get to Dong Seoul Bus Terminus and buy a ticket to Jangpyeong Interchange. This could be scary as within Dong Seoul, you will see THREE different ways of spelling Jangpyeong (using roman characters). Best to be familiar with the Korean characters of Jangpyeong, prepare it on a sheet of paper or your mobile phone and show it to the ticket counter. Buses run many times across the day and night from Dong Seoul to Jangpyeong, costing (as at Dec 2016) around 11,600 won or something like that, one way. You will get a ticket which specifies your seat number and bus departure time. Go find the bus bay and load up your own luggage. Then you are on your way to Jangpyeong. Jangpyeong was the first stop after leaving Dong Seoul, around 2 hours away. Hopefully you would have previously found the Phoenix Park shuttle bus timetable online, and know what time is the next pickup from Jangpyeong. 5 mins before the pickup, exit the terminus and cross the road. There ought to be a queue (even in -6 degrees centigrade temperature). And the shuttle will come (roughly) on time. The shuttle will have Phoenix Park written all over it. Hence, the grand total cost to get from Dong Seoul to Sweet Coop should be exactly the price of that bus ticket. I am sorry, I have no idea what a taxi from Jangpyeong interchange to Phoenix Park will cost.The return leg should be the same. Wait for the Phoenix Park shuttle in the bus parking lot area according to their timetable, get to Jangpyeong interchange and buy your ticket back to Dong Seoul (or wherever else you want to go e.g. Sokcho).For those coming from Incheon airport, if on a budget, take the ALL-STOP train to Seoul, transfer to the local Seoul subway to get to Gangbyeon station (green line), follow the exit signs saying ""Dong Seoul"" and cross the road. You will be at the bus terminus for around 5,000 won (one way from Incheon).Some other reviewers here have already mentioned the water theme park. We didn't go in, so I shall skip that. Phoenix Park was fun for the skier. Phoenix Park was not too bad for us non-skiers. Given that there are so many other ski areas in Pyeongchang, maybe we might not come back to Phoenix and try out the others. But for first timers, Phoenix Park is fine."
Ski Resort,Resort will host the 2018 Winter Olympic Games. Very nice ski resort. The Slopes are fantastic and we have great weather. Highly Recommend for all.
Nice ski resort with indoor water theme park,"This resort is wonderful with nice ski slope and the indoor water theme park. The water theme park is wonderful place for kids, the water is warm and has a few slides. Kids enjoy the simulated wave pool. Adults enjoy soaking in the various spa available. They have ginseng, aloe and other pools. As for the ski resort, it's just situated next to the hotel. Overall we had time at the both area. "
Nice Ski Resort,"We stayed at Elf Pension for 3 days and went to Phoenix Park for our Ski.We asked the hotel help us to book a taxi for full day and the cost is only USD80, the taxi driver even drove us to nearby town to have local sashimi restaurant.The only problem we encounter is the taxi uncle can't speak English at all.We have to ask the front desk in Phoenix hotel help us to communicate with the uncle.Overall, good experience."
Ski trip,"It was my first time going to Ski. The place is amazing, deserving of the 2018 Winter Olympics. Had a blast"
It was good enough for the first winter experience,"Not lacks... We just enjoy the winter and play as much as we want and not thinking about what was lacking there . For me, it was perfect . "
An eyeopening experience,"We never been to any ski resort and took a cab from Elf Pension to have a look. There is no admission charge unless you want to rent their ski or use their facilities.We just wonder around the ground level and take photos. There are many ski equipment lying around unattended at the corners which I think some members of the public have left it there while they are resting. We ""borrow"" them to take photos and put it back after that.During our 3 hours there, we saw 3 incidents where ski-ers were injured and was ferried by ski ambulance to their own medical room. Think one lady was seriously injured and was sent to the hospital by ambulance. Thus I would advise those who doesn't have any ski experience to take up lesson and not to go to the high slope. Although we didn't ski, we enjoy ourselves there."
Best resort (in Korea),"This review may be bias because we just had a snowdump yesterday and I've not yet been skiing in Japan. As with all tourism in Korea it's best to go with low expectations if you want to be pleasantly surprised. Saying that, I want to put a realistic viewpoint on a lot of the negative feedback I read before visiting.Transport: difficult to arrange buses from Seoul without being here already. Luckily our accomodation gave us all the info in English. Bus ticket office in Gimpo airport was very helpful. Bus from Seoul airports cannot be pre-booked, but was booked solid when we landed. Some of our party had to wait from 0930 until 1530 in the Lotte shopping mall for 4 seats on a bus. The bus took 3hrs then dropped us at a highway service station, we then got a 30min taxi to our accomodation. On our return, we are booking a shuttle bus for 8 of us, more expensive but simpler.Speaking to a Korean skier, it is possible to fly to an airport only 1hr from the resort instead.Accomodation: lots of European resort style high rise hotels in the resort, including a youth hostel beside the main gondola. As you would expect these are expensive, so we booked a cheaper chalet 5mins down the road. The ski rental business next door did a great service shuttling us to the resort whenever we wanted. The accomodation was typical: looks luxurious but flimsy and poorly designed when you actually use it (for example stairs are very difficult to negotiate). Widespread fluent English is a problem, but we were lucky with our chalet owner.Skiing: best artifical snow I've ever been on! They did a great job covering the mountain. 22 trails, 8 lifts. Not as busy as I had been warned, although slope or queue etiquette is lacking. NO off-piste. Lots of ski racers but no freestyle, LOTS of freestyle snowboarders in the jumps park and half pipe though and a big pro slopestyle course being built. I was told that freestyle skiing does not exist in Phoenix. Lift passes are very affordable and weekend hours are great. You buy day passes or in 4hr blocks: 0830-1230; 1230-1630; 1630-2130; and 2130-0430 at weekends!Food: plenty of snack shacks outside the base building and a Korean / Japanese food hall inside. Fast food burger and chicken inside. CU (7/11) store inside with microwaves for hot snacks. Away from the resort we tried a Korean BBQ but service was VERY poor and anti-foreigner, we felt less than welcome there, but this was an improvement on other restaurants which simply turned us away.Other activities: well serviced resort with a sledging zone, bowling alley and water park / traditional sauna only 5mins walk from the slopes. Limited apres-ski bars but we found a Heineken bar with good beer, good snacks and lots of bar games.English speaking: not widespread, but if you keep sentences simple we managed to understand our hosts very well and found them very friendly, funny and accomodating. It's not yet an Olympic resort, but they are trying and they are getting there.In summary, Phoenix Park resort is the most western place I have visited in Korea. Skiing was a mix of NZ size ski resort with European quality artificial snow and an odd unique ski etiquette. We had a great time skiing, swimming, relaxing, eating, drinking and partying. Exactly what you want from a ski holiday."
Great Slopes for all levels.,"The slopes are great ranging from beginners, medium and advance levels. There is quite a big jump between the levels, so make sure you know what your in for. One thing i would suggest is that they sign post routes a little more clearly. The location of the accomodation is very close ( about 5 minutes) and has all you basic needs, a fridge, wifi, bath/shower and a TV. For sleeping on, there is only the korean style floor matts which are quiet thin, but there are also thick blankets and pillow you can use to layer to make it more comfortable.Food wise, there is very little available other than junk food restuarants and coffee shops, many of which are closed early and leaving you only with the local 7/11 if you arrive back late from the slopes. There is also a swim park within the park which has both indoor and outdoor pools and fragrant spas."
boarding in Pheonix Park,"We stayed in the Royal Suite with 10 people in the Blue Condo in Phoenix Park. Dont get me wrong, i had a great time there but the hotel was a little tired and there were no bars and was really hard to get something to eat after 830pm. there was free wifi in the rooms, which was a bonus. Yongpyong is half an hour away, i would suggest going there. TIPSOndol rooms means a thin mattress and thin pillow, which was fine but if you havent been camping before or have a sore body from being out on the snow, you might feel a bit uncomfy."
Still lots more to be done in preparation for 2018 Winter Olympic,"This place will be hosting the next Winter Olympic and I thought it's worthwhile to include this into my itinerary before everything become expensive.a) Accesibility/transportIf you are making way into Phoenix Ski Park from Seoul, there is no problem as there are various mode of transport :1. You can either take a bus to JangPyeong terminal and hop into the shuttle bus provided by the ski park. Shuttle buses are not regular so please plan your arrival time accordingly. The shuttle bus arrived very punctual on time and you must be there early and they dont wait for passenger even the bus is only quarter/half loaded. Once you arrived at JangPyeong terminal, cross the road and wait by the side. There are few restaurant around the area. This is slightly tricky as no sign etc to guide you. Do ask the local if you are unsure but i found this difficult as barely anyone can speak english.2. Make a reservation on Phoenix Ski park website for shuttle bus from Seoul. This method is not tested so I cannot verify any details. I also found limited information on their website so I go for option 1.3. The hassle free way is to take a cab to the ski park. This is the most expensive way. It takes around 2 hours or so to reach by taxi.b) FacilitiesYou can rent equipment and clothing from the park. So you can choose to travel light and get the equipment there. This park is the largest in Pyeongchang and it has the best slopes in the entire South Korea.Gondola service ends at 4 pm so don't bother to go up if you arrived past 3 pm. No one informed us on the closing hours and we wasted the ticket money for a very short ride.c) Food and beveragesWhat amazes me is South Korea seems to be promoting unhealthy eating culture. All convenient stores sell ramen cup (instant noodle) and fast food. Imagine you had a great workout at the ski park and indulge in a bowl of sinful ramen. There is a food court but its super crowded and expensive. You will not be able to find bread or healthy snacks there. Pack your own food if you want healthy eating.Coffee and drinking water are widely available so no issue.c) AccomodationThe closer the hotel to the ski park, the more expensive its gonna cost you. Be prepared to spend on this. You can choose to stay a little further but again with the transport fee, this will add up to your cost. Taxi fare is twice more expensive compared to Seoul due to the location. I stayed 2km away from the ski park and the taxi cost me 13,000 won per way.d) ServiceFirstly, you will strike a lottery if you can find any English speaking staff to assist you. Everybody including taxi driver, they speak nothing except korean. The staff at the information counter speaks limited english and most of the time, messages are wrongly interpreted. Signage are all in korean except for some public information like 'exit and rental counter'. Foreigners will need to put extra effort to get their way around.The entire complex is wet all the time and no cleaner/staff to constantly manage the condition. No taxi station is seen within the park vicinity. It's best that you get the number of the taxi driver that dropped you off at the ski park for return pick up. You can get the information counter to assist with the calling.The park is super crowded so ski at your own risk.There are lots more to improve before they unveil the 2018 winter olympic. "
A lot of variety with slopes,"This is a great park to visit if you are ever in South Korea. They offer several beginner, intermediate, and advanced slopes. It's well organized and there's a lot of options for food. The prices are also extremely reasonable. With the Winter Olympics here in 2018, you can see why this is such a great park."
Skiing at Phoenix Park and Staying at Elf Pension,"There are three beginner courses: Level 1 Dodo; Level 2 Penguin; Level 3 Sparrow and two beginner-intermediate: Hawk 1 and Hawk 2. I like skiing at Phoenix Park as Sparrow is almost 1km, and Hawks are exciting for my kids. This was our 2nd time of skiing.The bad thing is that it is very crowded on weekends and holidays. Another thing is that there is not enough snow in December in Seoul due to the global warming!"
Probably still the best winter resort in Korea,"Great selection of ski tracks from beginner to advanced level. Good artificial snow quality which can be produced when the temperature of the air is as high as +3 °C given the very low humidity of the area, Snowmaking is used to supplement natural snow which is lacking most the winter season in Korea."
Limited skiing - compared to places like Japan and NZ,Little snow so only 2 lifts open. Mountains not that tall and limited runs (if they were open).Limited English speakers in resort so takes some time to organize lift tickets and all the rest to go skiing - wasted half day on this.Floors very slippy at end of day.Limited food choices and English instructors only on night ski times.This was as start of season so things may get better.Did not see medical facilities. I had accident and had to go to seoul for treatment
Adequately furnished but Fraught with admin nightmares ,"First was the arrangement for booking of shuttle services was met with constant delays and unanswered calls. They also do not have English speaking staff which complicates things. The ski world was okay, but administration also has room for improvement but not as much a disaster as the hotelier/condo staff. The condo was well furnished but the place seems old. It is not travelled friendly so Make sure you come with a tour group or ask a Korean friend to book for you or you will be constantly worried like my family was the days before. "
Among the longest runs ever,"Like all ski resorts in Korea... this one is equally top notch in its slopes and services. One of the longest runs we have experienced and certainly does not feel crowded even though it was one of the busiest times of the year. The slopes are pretty wide and well shared between boarders and skiers, though there is a strong predominance of boarders. Can't wait to see how they will develop it further for the Winter Olympics coming up. Will be back soon...."
Great view but limited activities,"We went here during the autumn season and had a good view of the surrounding area. Other than a small sheep ranch that allows tourist to feed the animals, there is nothing much to do other than enjoying the view. The cable car ride was a short one but enjoyable since there was no line to queue because we had visited during the off peak season for this place. We were told by our guide that this spot is a hit during winter."
Good but not the best...,"Phoenix Park is set to be one of the ski resorts to be used in the 2018 Winter Olympics in South Korea. The facilities are great and the slopes are perfect for beginners, making the overall experience a good one. Accommodation ranges from dorm style rooms to condos to suit any travelers needs. Rentals are available at the resort or at the many shops around the area. The only is con is that there aren't as many runs as other parks in Korea and they're not as long either. I preferred High 1 but if you're unable to get across the country, Phoenix Park is still a great alternative."
Nice ski resort,"It is one of the best ski resort I think, but I prefer Yongpyong to it.Although the slopes here are not as high as Yongpyong, its location are very nice and best for beginners. Scenery of the park are very beautiful as well. "
Ridiculous food serving at their food place,"Nice place to ski with great slope for beginner. I'm really enjoy skiing here. When lunch time approaching, we heading to the food court named Food Place. We order beef stew and chicken teriyaki fried rice KRW10,000 each. The food is lousy, I only see a tiny piece of beef in the soup stew!. The chicken teriyaki fried rice also only got very tiny piece of chicken in the rice!. KRW10,000 if I convert to ringgit malaysia is about RM33.00. This is really out of mind hahaha!!. This place I only find 1 person who can speak very little English, seems like this place only welcome local tourist (korean). Very difficult to communicate and we just do our own things and ski on our own risk. "
Nice ski place,"For a first timer, the place is good. There are shops that sell skiing stuff and big eatery place. There are different skiing package for different audience and you can even ski at night. Good beginner's slope to start with. And it is connect to the Water Park so it is very convenient. "
good for skiing and snowboarding but not recommend to stay this resort,"The park is far away from Seoul about 2~2.5 hours normally. but lots of cars are used to moving like ants on the high way at peak season. By the way, I brought my snowboarding clothes in person and rented boarding equipment. I could rent it with cheaper price than usual by social commerce. All in all the ski courses and other facilities are ok but the resort rooms are older than other surrounding resorts. Plus, I don't understand why I have to clean the resort room up before I check out."
Ski Park,"The park is open practically 24 hours when I was there, with approximately a 2-hour cleaning session every few hours or so I believe. It's our first time skiing and we all had fun! And when we got tired, we just walk around to people-watch or head back to our hotel room where we had a great view of the ski slopes. There are food options around too and a convenience store. The skiing experience is definitely one of the highlights of our trip."
excellent ski resort for beginners and professionals,my wife and 6 year old daughter enjoyed so much our half day skiing at this resort. There is a separate area for beginners and also for professional skiers so we did not worry about getting hit or hitting someone during practice. We settled in a gentle slope wherein our daughter was able to learn in just 1 try!
During winter air con are not on need to open window,"It stuffy during winter as most of the hotel do not on the air con, you need to open your window to let some fresh air blow into the room.Pretty cold ensure you have enough winter wear during winter season."
Have Fun!!!,"We were here by December 2014. The journey from Seoul to here is about 2 hours. We joint a ski trip which recommended by our guesthouse owner. A lot of people here, from beginner to professionals. The space is very big so we don't feel packed at all. The restaurant here served very tasty chicken chop. I prefer this ski park more than yongpeong ski resort which I visited 2 years ago. Hope can stayed a nite in this resort in the future. My kids were very happy and enjoyed."
Stay away from society.,"Hotel accommodation has two choices for you. Sleeping on beds like you usually do or try the Korean traditional way sleeping on the floor with bed sheet laid out. Very good experience when you are in Korea. The location is a bit secluded from everything but there is a convenient store just opposite the hotel and bowling and pool. Nearing the winter season, the area is pretty cooling and temperature drops to pretty low. Overall a very nice place to stay for experience."
Here's something not often mentioned,"If you're coming to this ski resort to ski, or if your tour agency decides to put you here for the night, then there's something important you need to know. They turn off all air conditions after 9pm during Spring, Autumn and Winter. My Tour Agent forgot to mention that to us that the window has to be open, and he didn't explain how until i called and scream from the rude shock of waking up in the heat, when my window is cooler and probably more comfortable to rest on.The beds, if you get beds and not futons, are pretty much the same, hard like the floor. This hotel was rated ""5 stars"" prolly in the 70s or 80s so.... don't expect too much in the designs unless you're a hipster design wannabe, then in that case its super #trendy #retro As a fan of the Korean Drama, Hotel King, i came here with 10% of its expectations. I was forced to take all my expectations back."
Fun!,"I visited to ski twice this past season, in late November and then again in early March. Both times, I came with Adventure Korea. The snow was much better in November, of course, but still, I don't think the snowfall was so good this year. Only the ski resort area had considerable snow. I've only skiied in Northern California before this, and this seemed like a very small ski resort to me. Most slopes were either too easy or too difficult for me, and the only slope that was just right was quite short. But hey, this is South Korea not Tahoe. It's been too long since I last skied, so I had a blast! Plus, it's pretty cool that the 2018 Winter Olympics will be in this area. Aside from the skiing/snowboarding, the facilities are good. Several restaurants (including Starbucks), convenience stores nearby, good bathrooms, lockers for skis/snowboard, and hostel/condominiums. There's even an arcade, a waterpark, and karaoke rooms."
Great Ski Park,"Another great ski park in the PyeongChang area. There are plenty of ski hire shops near by as well as within the resort itself. The beginner slope was probably a little more steep than the beginner slope at YongPyong, however both parks are a good 30-40 minute drive from each other."
So much fun!,"I went to visit a friend who lives in Seoul over the new year and he took me here for two days to go snowboarding. It was awesome! We avoided the weekend crowds and went during the week. It was still quite busy but apparently there are far more people on the weekends. It was my first time snowboarding but by the end of the day, I was cruising down a selection of slopes that are geared for both novice and intermediate skiers and snowboarders. There are loads of places to eat, grab a coffee (or beer!), and just chill and watch the pros! Gear was easily rented from one of the nearby ski shops - they even gave me a free beanie and scarf which I could keep after. Friendly, helpful people all around and a great place to visit!"
"Good variety of slopes, fun atmosphere","It was only my second time ever skiing, but Phoenix Park was a lot of fun! My wife and I visited along with 4 of our friends. We stayed just 400m away in White Cabin, please check them out as their accomodations and services were excellent. We skiied from midnight until 3:30am on Friday and then from 2pm-10pm on Saturday. On Friday night it was a bit chilly but the snow quality was pretty good and the slopes weren't too busy at all. There were almost no lines at all. We all pretty much started on the green (beginner slopes) in which they had a couple options open running during this late-night session. Many of the other slopes were closed during this time but it was ok. On Saturday, it was a bit of a warm and sunny day and it was quite busy. There were lots of people, but surprisingly we didn't seem to ever wait more than 5-10minin a line for a lift or the gondola. From 4:30pm-6:30pm all slopes were closed for cleaning/maintenence where they groomed all the slopes. There's plenty of good food to choose from, and it's all at a very reasonable price (not too inflated at all). We got back out at 6:30pm and all the slopes were still open, and the condition was AWESOME! Nice smooth trails with great powder made it a blast. We ended up going down all the slopes (except moguls and extreme park) and they were all quite exciting. It gets busy down near the bottom but there are plenty of lifts in the middle so you can buzz back up to the top quickly. I'd recommend Phoenix Park for sure. It's not the biggest park in South Korea, but it's easily accessable from hwy 50, just 5 minutes off the exit. And on top of it all, it was cool to see where some events in the 2018 Olympics will be held."
Great for some mid-week skiing!,"I had fun! Got a W48,000 internet deal for skiing and rentals, stayed with a friend, and enjoyed the day with few others at the resort. There are few advanced runs, so this place caters to a lot of novice and intermediate skiers. After 2:00 it got a lot more crowded, especially at the bottom. Still, there are some nice independent businesses, independent family-run hotels and min-baks (if you don't have friends to stay with^^)."
If you have never skied on a real mountain before...then it's good,"Spending the Christmas holidays to visit the in-laws in Seoul, so we decided to have a look at what Korea has to offer for the 2018 Winter Olympics. As far as skiing/snowboarding is concerned....I was expecting much more. If you are an average or good skier, if you have skied in the Alps before, you will be disappointed. Very small resort with a bunch of short slopes in a OK managed resort. Not your white, nature escape!I have been to Chinese ski slopes before around Beijing...which is something even more depressing, but we thought that Korea could offer more than this.Nonetheless, the installations are pretty good and the lines at the ski lifts are not too long. The loudspeaker and ski patrol on the slopes are weird, though.So, I would not recommend Pyeongchang (Phoenix or any other resort in the country) as a destination. It is also rather pricey. Living in Switzerland with amazing mountains and relatively pricey ski passes, I was surprised both by the price of ski passes AND accommodation in the area."
Best stay,We stay here Phoenix Ski Resort 2D1N during 111213 (Dec13) winter time. Nice place & comfort. Kids enjoy ski and made snowman. 
Family-friendly + Ski Fun,"Skiers and snowboarders will find sufficient variety of difficulty of runs in the resort. Even non-skiers are entertained by the sleigh slope, bowling alleys and indoor waterpark. The convenient store is a bit small for cooking fans but choices of Korean restaurants plus Starbucks and PizzaBox have assured our culinary friends satisfied. Our trip was ended with a shopping spree in the Yeoji outlets which are about 1-hour away from the ski resort. No complaint from value-for-money perspective. If snow quality is the ultimate concern, I would suggest Jan instead of Dec. "
"Decent skipark, 24/7 skiing even at night","Phoenixskipark is a nice trip for a couple of days or maybe a long weekend. Wouldn't recommend any experienced skiers to go there longer. I have been skiing for most of life and had seen all the pistes within a couple of hours. Not so strange with only one hill and 16 pistes. All pistes are however well maintained and offer some excited due to increased steepness at some spots. All pistes are wide, guarded by safetynets and there was barely any waiting time at the cablecarts. Be aware of the lack of maintenance on the 'group' rental equipment. If this had been better I would have definitely have given a 5 star recommendation. Do rent your equipment around one the many local shops that are available. Those can rent you all the other stuff (clothes, goggles, helmets e.o.) for a small surcharge as well. I almost forget to mention that it is possible to ski during the evening and night. So you can really make the most of your time there by skiing around the clock."
Have fun in the water with children,"Summer is very hot and muggy in Korea except Gang-won province. Then I went there with family trip in the middle of summer. I stayed 2 nights and 3 days at Phoenix Park Resort - for enjoying with water [theme park; Blue canyon] and accommodation. To be candid with you, accommodation was so-so but theme park was perfect place to play with children. The water park includes several kinds of pools and rides. When I entered the theme park, they requested safe vast for not only children but also adult. Personally I hated to wear safety vast but it’s really good for children in the safety point of view,If you are planning to travel in Gang-won province this hot summer, Pyeongchang is the right place to visit and relax with family.p.s. you can reach Odeasan, Dakwanryung, or other attractions within hour by car."
You get what you pay for,"We stayed here during the off peak non winter season. You see more cars than visitors. The breakfast room looks impressive. Due to the handful number of guests, the hotel does not serve buffet style breakfast but set menu. Room: basic, clean and comfortable. There is only one power point and no Internet LAN point. However, there is a free wifi. The shower point holder was damaged and make bathing a challenge. No toothbrush was provided."
Oh Phoenix,"Variable snow quality and patchy snowfall.Not varied enough terrain for a prolonged visit, but being a long drive from Seoul, you have to at least stay 2 days."
Night Skiing,"We went night skiiing at Phoenix Park. Thought it was strange how they shut everything down for the two hours in between daytime skiing and night skiing. We couldn't rent skiis or buy lift tickets until 6pm, which cut a bit into our ski time. The slopes were really nice and fun to ski. "
Skiing,"Get ready for a blast. This place is a snow boarders paradise. Great trails, but be ready to be swamped by boarders."
A great place to ski!,"Try taking cable car up the Mont Blanc and you'll be able to have a great view of the ski resort. Though there were many guests during holiday season, it was spacious enough for everyone to ski. I'll definitely be back for more skiing fun! "
Phoenix Park: Nothing special but an excellent ski center,"Phoenix Park seems to be one of the most popular ski resorts in South Korea. It is located in PyeongChang county, Gangwon-do province. By the way, PyeongChang County has been repeatedly pushing its candidacy for one of the next Winter Olympics. You need less than 2 hours by bus from Seoul to Phoenix Park (the road distance is approximately 180 km). If you do not mind traveling by bus, there are several bus lines starting from Seoul to Phoenix Park and vice-versa, and I found the 'Good Bus' as a reliable and non-expensive operator (16,000 won per 1-way ride ticket). If unsure related to the bus lines, just ask your hotel receptionists.Besides several ski slopes that range from those for beginners to those for advanced skiers and semi-professionals, Phoenix Park is also equipped with 'Blue Canyon', which is a family-oriented swimming & fun summer sub-resort with both indoor and outdoor zones, as well as the 'Center Plaza' house with a nearby indoor pool. There are also internationally recognized, excellent golf facilities available. (While swimming is possible during the winter months in the Center Plaza's pool, the nearby golf terrains are closed, as expected.) Tickets for the Center Plaza pool are sold per day and I was not sure if repetitive going outside and inside was allowed with the same ticket. To be honest, I was looking for just an ordinary swimming pool that, as a hotel guest, I could use for some half an hour in the evenings - before going to bed, but it looked like that the swimming pool in Center Plaza was intended to serve as 'one size fits all'. I mean, you pay the full price ticket regardless you want to spend one hour or six hours there.For those of you who are ski or snowboarding fans, Phoenix Park is a right place for you. It is very well equipped with various winter sport facilities, including ski & boots rentals, as well as related services. You can perform winter sports both during the days and during the nights, though the tickets for night skiing are more expensive. Hotels in Phoenix Park are located just 1-3 minute walk from the nearest ski slopes, so you will not need any additional transportation to and from your hotel room. There is also an excellent restaurant called 'cafeteria', which is near the slopes too. It will satisfy your hunger at any time because it is open almost the whole day. The cafeteria offers traditional Korean cooked meals, based on rice and vegetables, including well-known Kimchi in different flavors, as well as some western-style meals. You can also order fast food in several outlets, etcetera. Besides the cafeteria, which was cheap and mostly crowded by young people this February, there were a couple of fashionable restaurants for those with deeper wallets. Finally, there are a couple of shops offering various snacks, drinks and accessories.If somebody expects to find an extraordinary fun in Phoenix Park, or some interesting cultural activity, or some sightseeing of historical value, there is not much of that – if any. Actually, you are on your own. For example, I tried to get some information about how to reach some Buddhist temples or shrines in the local area within the same Gangwon-do province, but to be near to Phoenix Park. It appeared that during the winter seasons the only way to go to the nearest site of that kind is to order a single-direction (and rather expensive) taxi to the area of your interest and hope to find similar way to go back, after your visit. That means the first cab would not wait an hour or so for you to visit the site, so you should negotiate your ride back well in advance, with another cab or so. Although I proposed them as a solution, they seemed not to think about eventual organizing local half-day tours for the hotel guests, by mini-vans or so. (Maybe they have something like that during summer season, I do not know.) Therefore, during the wintertime you will not learn much about Korean history, art and culture while in Phoenix Park. The only thing you will learn about is the Korean cuisine, which I really liked. My suggestion for you is to try them all, by starting your meal with a cup of green tea and finish your lunch or dinner with a big 'green tea latte to-go', or something similar. If possible, try to avoid 'hamburgers' and other western-like fast food and drinks, as well as the black coffee.As a passionate walker and a non-ski person (I was there for business reasons), I would like if Phoenix Park offered some cultivated pedestrian areas. I mean, it would be nice to have an option of easy walks, while it snows outside, but not to get into danger by colliding with the skiers so easily. In fact, it looked to me that they constructed everything there to satisfy only those performing winter sports. In addition, it would be also nice if they could add some, say, theatrical events in the evenings or some musical performance for … well, a little bit older guests (but not a discothèque for teenagers or so). Besides the 'main' hotel in Phoenix Park, called simply The Hotel, which is an 11-floor building, there are three separate condominiums, the 'orange', the 'green' and the 'blue' (the 'blue' one is an approximately 25-floor tall 'skyscraper'). All four sleeping buildings are interconnected in between by underground corridors, and are linked to the 'Center Plaza' facility. The Center Plaza building also includes bowling tracks, kids & moms playing ground, coffee shop and winter sport clothing store. As a guest of The Hotel, I found it in a real need of renovation: its rooms' walls screamed for repainting while some furniture needed fixing or replacement; the refrigerators in the rooms were noisy, etc. (Eg. the refrigerators/bars in my rooms tended to switch on/off loudly during the nights.) Although the hotel's staff was young and responsive, their level of speaking English might be increased. In fact, it was obvious they did not have much experience with non-Korean guests. [By the way, it is a remark, if not a warning for both Phoenix Park and PyeongChang county officials, as well as for other Gangwon-do province authorities – should they really want to accommodate one of the next Winter Olympics.]In addition to The Hotel group, there are some other hotels and/or hostels in the local area of Phoenix Park, some of which looked to me as being reserved for some special club-members only. Moreover, the other hotels are not so close to the ski slopes as The Hotel and its condominiums, but are not too far away either (some 10-15 minute walk max). Because of the low level in tourist information, related to the accommodation in Phoenix Park, I can say nothing about price tags and quality of service in the nearby hotels and hostels. However, some people I discussed with on the venue claimed that The Hotel was too expensive for its QoS.On a central plateau in front of The Hotel, a large TV screen displays video clips as well as outdoor temperatures and time. Korean pop music plays during the ski hours and it stops only during servicing hours and late in the nights."
