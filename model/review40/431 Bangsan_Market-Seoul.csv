Interesting specialty market,"There are lots of packing stuffs in this market.Almost no place to eat unlike other typical traditional markets.It's not a place for tourists. But, just visit and take a look if you are interested."
Baking Market Seoul,"Great place to find everything you need for baking. Cake Boxes, decorator tips pans and more. Take some time to really shop as prices vary and some shops only sell in quantities of 100 or more."
Baking and packaging stores,Market was across the street from the Gwangjang market and so we venture there after having exploring the food market. Bangsan market has got shops selling bakeware and packaging materials. I checked out a few bakeware shops and thought the prices were quite resonable Bought a few Russian piping tips for 1000won each. 
More to packaging,More to baking packaging rather than baking ingredients.. there's many small shops hidden along the street.. ingredients not alot.. not too bad to take a stroll there
go to place for a different vibe,"Easily reachable by walking along the Cheonggyecheon stream and across from Gwangjang Market, Bangsan is Seoulâ€™s best market for baking products and paraphernalia, packaging and boxes. Not often visited by tourists but worth a side trip from Gwangjang. It's fascinating to see how and where local coffee shops and cafes get all of their accoutrements."
Bagger's and baker's delight.,"Korea seems to specialize in keeping like with like. Not for them the idea that shops selling paint should be next to shops selling clothes, instead they have markets, like Bangsan, specializing in one thing. In the case of Bangsan, that thing is packaging.But there is a hidden part of Bangsan - the alleyways where special baking supply shops have sprung up over the years. Here you will find a plethora of pans, pots, scales, mixers, cutters, boards, pastry bags, nozzles, and any other possible thing that a baker might need. There is even a shop that offers lessons in cake decorating and sugar craft. If you are after any such things, pay this a visit.And of course, if you do enjoy making baked goodies, you can drop in to any of the shops selling bags and boxes, and buy something that will make your gifts look professional. Even just wandering around the shops and looking at the wares on sale is an experience.And, of course, you are close to the Cheonggyecheon stream, a sight worth visiting in and of itself."
