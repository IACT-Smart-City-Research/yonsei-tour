Multi-story movie theater,"If you are feeling like a movie, this is a nice, clean multi-story movie theater in the midst of Seoul. Most movies are in English with subtitles so whether you are Korean or not you will enjoy the experience."
Watched a movie,Don't be intimidated by the process of buying tickets. I used an english website to check the timing of the movie and proceeded to buy the tickets. 10000won / ticket. Cinema looks old. Luckily the cashier knows english well enough to let us know which floor and which theater to go to. Pro Tip: Movie starts on the dot. don't be late or you'll get a few tsks coming your way.
