Travel lovers are not recommended,Tourists who are mostly elderly or do not frequent travel make up the majority.So overall the price is expensive.There are many street vendors selling bad food that are difficult to see in tourist complexes.It is inconvenient for them to walk around the lake.주로 연로하거나 자주 여행을 다니지 않는 관광객들이 주를 이룸.그래서 전반적으로 가격이 비쌈.관광단지에는 보기 힘든 불량식품을 파는 노점상들이 많음. 이들로 인해 호수가 주변을 걷기가 불편함.
Your typical lake resort area,"I believe Bomun Lake is natural, but the areas surrounding the lake are filled with your usual resort attractions, theme park, shopping, etc. This is probably a destination resort area for your Korean family during the summer. I went there in early November and the place is quite empty at that time. I could imagine the place is absolutely crowded in the summer due to the number of resort hotels and theme park attractions in the area. The duck boats and other attractions were closed/not operational at the time I went though.The area around the lake is quite beautiful though, with plenty of walking trails surrounding the lake. I also saw many people walking their dogs on the trails/walkways as well. The lake itself seemed to be quite clean. The place is worth a brief look and would be ideal as a resort vacation in the summer. However, it is probably not worth much of a visit by the foreign traveler as it is a place you can probably see at home or your typical resort in your home country."
The view from the bus ...,"We didn't stay here. But glad of that.This must be a lovely place to visit when the weather is good and you need a respite from urban life. But our view of the area, from bus #10 heading to Bulguksa Temple, convinced us that this was really not the right place for us to stay and we're glad we stayed in Gyeongju.As we wandered around Gyeongju at night and stumbled across a fantastic festival, saw the illuminated burial mounds and enjoyed the town's nightlife, we commented to each other that we would have missed all of this if we'd stayed 'at the lake'. If a lake, resort holiday is your attraction to Gyeongju, then this complex must be the right place to meet your needs. If you're here to see some of the history of the area and experience Gyeongju then staying in town would be a better choice. I guess you could mix the two but that wasn't our reason to be there. Just sayin'."
Beautiful place and beautiful music,I enjoyed Gyeongju international music festival at Bomun lake outdoor theater during 4th to 7th August. The pathway is good for walking around the lake.
"Silly, Schlocky, And Really Fun",This is a resort area with a capital R. There are all sorts of entertainment activities and countless eateries in a really beautiful location. Great for all ages and groups with many hotels at a wide range of price points. The duck boat rentals and little electric cars for the kiddies are corny but very fun.
Don't go out of your way for this...,"but if you're staying in the neighborhood, and the weather is nice, treat yourself to a stroll around the lake."
"Great for couples, families or friends!","Visited in the spring, there were a lot of people picnicking and kids, also cute dogs running around, nothing too noisy though. Atmosphere is nice, my friend and I had earlier bought a big box of strawberries and sat on one of the many benches around, enjoying the great weather there that day. There is a bridge connecting to the theme park as well. "
Bomun Lake in Kyungju,"This lake is very big. It will take more than one hour to walh around it. There are lots of hotels, resaurants, or cafes. Yon can paddle boats or walk or jog around the lake. There iare an amusement park, Millenium Park, or golf courses near the lake."
"Skip it, there are lots of other much nicer places to visit in Gyeongju","If you want to have a fake Traditional Korean experience and pay inflated prices, then Bomun is for you. The surrounding park is lovely year-round, but all the restaurants and fake hanok-style buildings drape the ugly commercialism of Korea onto things that could otherwise be enjoyable."
Tacky Swan boats!,"The trail around the lake is the best thing in this area. The second thing is probably the outdoor theater which unfortunately we didn't get to enjoy. Information on the performances was not readily available. Well, the hotel concierge was not aware of it even though we saw a poster in Korean showing the schedule of shows. Last and the worst part of the lake was the swan boat -- an eyesore! Tacky boats!"
"Bomun Lake, Good Attraction and Leisure Place","Bomun Lake scenic places can provide tourists and family a very good attraction and scenic view there. We enjoyed the nice cherry blossom and scenic views in the festival, and we took a lot of nice pictures. You must visit the surrounding and coastal area around the Bomun Lake, including the leisure and tourist complex."
Just a place to take a rest,"So many hotels, lodges, motels in here. Here are the place to sleep for travellers. That's all. Clean and comfortable, but expensive."
A Romantic Get Away,"Here is a great place for couples, families, or firends to go and have a great time. Whether walking on the boardwalk, ro taking a paddle boat on the water, or pedaling a bike for two or four. This place has it all. Pack up some Kimbap, cold green tea, fresh fruit, and a blanket to sit on and you have a low expense retreat on the Lake."
Its ok if you just want to go around a man made lake in a Swan Boat..,"The pathway around the lake is great anytime of the year.. I do however suggest to choose a time that its not packed with tourists like cherry blossom season and summer.. I am a big fan of that area in the fall when the mosquitoes are gone and you can walk around the lake, grab a take out coffee and just chill and relax.. The sunsets are really a good time for couples to sit and just enjoy the beauty of the area.. Just pick and choose a time to go..There are places to rent a bike or scooter or ATV.. There is Gyeongju World and the area is building up a little more with the addition of Starbuck's coffee, now two locations in the Bomun area.."
Good place for a walk or cycle.,"As a tourist area, it's Ok but does have a nice walkway / cycle path around the lake that makes for some scenic exercise."
Loved the waterpark and amusements - great fun day out!!,We Accidentslly stopped outside Clifoenia beach on our way from the temple nearby and totally unplanned went in! It cost 140000w for my husband son and I and we had a great afternoon and evening out! The waterpark was fun best wave pool and lazy crazy river ever! Stage entertainment all the time and rides looked great but to scary for my quite brave 7 year old! Took abit to figure out that you need to get a wrist band for 30000 w and use that to pay for everything inside and you must have life jacket which costs 4000 for the day! A bit annoying but heh ho Food was fine and good value hotdogs etc We had a few hours of fun then went to amusement place next door - your initial ticket gets you 5 rides! What a great park - no queues and amazing thrill rides! Way better than lotte world in Seoul - was amazed!! What a top day out! No one spoke English so the ticketing is confusing but once you get your head around it what a fab place Enjoy
it's worth a visit,"This seems to be a place for Koreans to have their resort holidays. You can take a cruise on those ducklings. It's worth a visit - the place is different from the heritage sites in Gyeongju - although it cannot be compared with other lakes like Luzern in Switzerland or Xi Hu in China, if you see what I mean!"
Re: Nice lake,Its advise to go there at the morning time or evening time. Rent a bicycle and have a scenic view around the area. 
A nice place to take a break,I bicycled to Silla Millenium Park from downtown Gyeongju and stopped here to have coffee and rest briefly. The resort included Gyeonju World which is close to Silla Millenium Park and can be visited together although there are separate admission tickets. There is also a museum.
