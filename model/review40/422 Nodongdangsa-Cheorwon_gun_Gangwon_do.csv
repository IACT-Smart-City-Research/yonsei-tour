"Quick Trip, Interesting Ruins, Creepy Wall Stains and Bullet Holes","Came here as part of our DMZ trip. We booked an agency, Adventure Korea, to visit the DMZ and this is one of our quick trip. You cannot enter the ruins because it is closed to public, with barricade. But we were able to have a walk around the ruins and see the interiors. Many died in this place and the tour guide said that we can see the blood stains on the wall, but I could not distinguish the blood and the dirt. Anyway, you can see the inside walls full of stains, vandals and bullet holes. The place is just simple. Nothing much to find. There is a mini shop near the place where you can eat or rest."
Just a quick stop,Before you get into DMZ. This place is famous for shooting Korea's legendary idol group Seo Taeji's music video 20 years ago. There are still bullet traces from Korean war and other than that- nothing but ruin.
Historic place,"One of Norths' office building before South got the Cheorwongun, Gangwon province.Peoples' party which is a only one party on North governed this district before the Korean war, and they slaughtered many people who are inoccent, just because they are not communist.This place is a historic place and many Riders who love cycling, stop by here.If you love road bike, then try!This is an awesome place to stop by."
War Ruins,"This building is a ruin of the former ""labour party"" building in Old Cheorwon. It was in Old Cheorwon which was pretty much razed during the Korean war. It is just outside the civilian restricted zone (very close to the checkpoint) so you can visit without going on the tour. We saw it as part of the Iron Triangle Battlefield tour. The bus just slowed as we passed by but there is not much to see really. It is just interesting to imagine how things used to be."
A really dramatic war ruin,"This is a ruin of the former Korean (North) Workers Party Headquarters, during the Korean war many people were tortured here and it's preserved as a monument. I walked here which took about 30-45 minutes from Baengmagoji railway station. There is a daily direct train from Seoul or there are numerous commuter trains which come from Dongducheon which connects with Seoul metro line 1.This site is also a common feature on tours of the area, a tour connects with the daily DMZ train and starts from the station. This also includes some sites inside the DMZ."
