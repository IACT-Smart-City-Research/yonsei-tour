Ilsan Beach,"The beach is always busy July through August, the local council have sent a lot of money on the area and the surrounding areas. Well worth the visit"
Just another beach.,You can access this beach while walking around Daewangam Park.Just follow the cliff walk.The walk around the cliffs is worth the efgort.
Ilsan Beach,"A very popular beach and the park next to the beach has had a lot of work done to it in past years, well worth a walk through this park"
GREAT ALL YEAR ROUND,"We enjoyed this beach area in December, but the open sewer going into the ocean was quite aweful. Wonder why they have this?"
"Ilsan Beach, a cozy beach in Ulsan","The beach normally opens from mid-July till late August. So, the best time for you to visit the place is summer. There are facilities for children so that many people come in family unit. Also, adults can enjoy various water sleighs such as banana boat. You may also rent swimming floats and beach umbrella. During the season, there are life guards and lifesaving equipment in order to prevent you from unexpected danger. Along the beach, you can see some coconut trees which you cannot see often in Korea. Also, there are many foreigners which make you feel as if you’re in different country. You’ll be wondering what to eat since there are various restaurants waiting for you to come in. Mostly, they sell fresh sea food such as raw fish and grilled shellfish, but there are others too. Since they are placed along the coastline, you can enjoy the ocean view while you’re enjoying your meal.Even if it’s not a summer season, I strongly recommend you to visit. The place is peaceful and quiet to enjoy a walk on the beach."
Happening place in Dong-gu/Bangeojin locality,"Ilsan beach is situated near the Daewangam park area. It has a lot of choices for korean food, fine dining and drinks. Pretty quiet in the day and perfect for evening stroll, people watch. There is a raw fish center at the end of the beach for those who like fresh seafood. Almost all buses plying to Kkotbawi will pass through Ilsan beach. Good for people to relax with food, drinks and if lucky..teenagers performing a karaoke by the shore."
Nice Beach,"Much less crowded that Haendae in Busan. Many foreigners use this beach since the Hyundai Ship yard is nearby so the beach has an international feel. Lots of restaurants, coffee shops, bars and hotels within easy walking distance make this a great place for a mini getaway."
Ilsan Beach in Ulsan,"The Ilsan beach is located in a bay between Hyundai vessel shipyard and Hyundai Heavy Industry yard.Clean water, plenty aera for people from the western hemisphere - locals are fully dressed and using 7m belt from water (+ a lot of tent). Behind that plenty space. Sun heading is against the sea and then hitting your back shoulders if you want to look out over the sea. Warm sand, 33C air temp at my visit, water may around 25.Ca 13000won for a taxi one way from downtown Ulsan."
So beautiful,"Yes, we had the perfect day: Blue sky but the view was amazing and people there were nice. There is no subways so you have to take the bus and that can be a little weird. Watched Brazil soccer game in the bus because it is a long ride."
Awesome,Definitely one of the most beautiful places in Ulsan district. Perferct jogging and walking pathways
Great for a relaxing walk anytime,"Ilsan Beach is a great place for a relaxing walk anytime. It's not a large area, but it's just enough to get in a good walk with no chance of getting lost. It's located right off the rocky coast and provides plenty of scenery. There are also plenty of restaurants, cafes, and bars nearby. "
Quiet beach for a good stroll and coffee,"It's right next to Daewangam Park linked big a flight of stairs. It's pretty quiet compared to Daewangam Park as the place is rather empty. You can have a good stroll and stop for coffee. If you are hungry, there are also lots of restaurants around.We took a stroll and walked towards to Homeplus in the city to do some shopping."
Nice beach close to the city center,"Not crowded as we are in December, the beach is lovely, away enough from the many industrial sites but close to the city center. There is a fish market where you can eat all the way at the bottom of the beach with an old fisherman village adjacent, very flavorful.."
Walk by the beach,Conveniently located in the city. You may visit the Ilsan beach.No entrance fee.Recommended activity: drinking coffee while strolling in the beach :)
Nice Beach and Hiking Area,"Really enjoyed myself there. The beach is beautiful, however did not get in the water because of a lot of seaweeds. The hiking area is breathing taking. Lots of good coffee shops and fun activities "
Best best on the East coast,This beach is the best by far. I have travelled to numerous beaches up and down from Ulsan and non beat this. A wide sandy bay with lots of restaurant and bars. Good for the Children to play safe. Walk up the steps to Daewargam park.
Most popular beach in Ulsan,"I like this beach because of the sand and some gravel near the water, shallow waters and the park nearby. On a weekend you easily can spend a day here with just reading, sleeping, volleyball or other games.There are plenty of cafes along the coast offering very tasty food for good price, no need to bring your own.The beach can be accessed by bus from downtown pretty quick, hard to find a parking."
Constantly Improving with New Shops and cafes,"Ilsan has seen a huge change over the past few years. What used to be an aging beach is now becoming a trendy area surrounded by decent restaurants, cafes and pubs. The road surrounding the beach has also been greatly improved giving a cleaner look to the area. Overall, it is a great place to go out and spend the day with food and shopping close by. "
Nice Walking and Hiking Area,"This area is quite out of the way from the central Ulsan areas Samsan and Seongnam. If you're interested in a beautiful beach, you can take an intercity bus to Haeundae Beach in Busan in the same amount of time it would take you to travel to Ilsan Beach by local bus. However, this is a lovely area for hiking and walking around. There are quite a few restaurants and bars in the area if you're into that sort of thing."
Best Beach to visit in Winter,"Beaches are usually visited in Summer but Ilsan beach is best to visit in Winter. There are no place for beaching, the sand near beach is hard and pebbles are every where. I would recommend this beach who love site seeing."
Great beach at the western side,Very good for relaxing and calm view. we had group photos by the beach. it's good for mementos! Its located at the bay and leads to open water to Japan!
"Ilsan Beach, next to Daewangam Park","This beach is white sand beach located at the end of Dong Gu, offering a marina and nice eating places restaurants all around it. Swimming is prohibited in winter and allowed in summers. The beach also hosts the marina and yachts are parked in one corner. Great place to enjoy water with kids and pets alongwith family.Its at walking distance from Home plus store in Dong Gu area."
