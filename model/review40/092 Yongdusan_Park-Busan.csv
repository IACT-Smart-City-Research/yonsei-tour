Great park and views ,Great park with great views of Busan including the Busan tower which is great to see a birds eye view 
city tower,Park with Tower come with friend looking for red leaves tree on October. its near from BIFF and Nampo shopping Area.
Nice Small Park,"Very nice park which overlooks the city and harbor. Similar to Namsan Tower in Seoul except not as high up, not as crowded and not as overrun by schoolchildren. There is a convenience store (sells beer!) a snack bar, a Twosome coffee, a gift shop and a duty-free shop (bought a BTS passport cover there!). Several benches, picnic tables and bench swings. Also a small Buddhist Temple, trinket vendors and hanbok rental. However it is not overy commercialized. Park is free but there is a charge to go up in the tower. Don't do towers, ladders, etc myself so I didn't check the cost. Go down the escalator on the other side and land on a busy shopping street a la Myeongdong. (There is also a Daiso on that street.). Grab a beer at the towerside convenience store and watch the sunset."
Good to seat after walk in BIFF,This park is same location of Busan Tower. It is accessible from BIFF with escalator leading you to the park and tower. Relaxing to seat around after a long and tiring walk around BIFF. 
Let down,We didn’t really expect what this park had to offer. It was a duty free shopping center with the Busan tower. Wasn’t worth our time to go up there. 
convenient,Just behind our hotel and we passed by on our way to Busan Tower. Not very big but quite good for a calm stroll
Great view from Busan Tower worth seeing,Busan Tower is definitely a place to visit! The view is stunning and the small gift shop is surprisingly entertaining. Easy walking distance to Gukje and Jagalchi market as well as Busan Modern History Museum. 
Good Views ,Yongdusan Park is a must! From the great views from the tower to the working clock made with flowers. There are a few small stores to float in and out as you make your way to the top of the tower. 
Boring park ,Visited the park while in the area. The attractive photo booth at the entrance drew us in but there is not much to do when we tmr each the top of the escalator. The view from the park was good for taking the Busan city skyline. 
Lovely park,"This park is located right at the bottom of the busan tower. It is a lovely park with nice screening views and nice banches to sit on and relaxe. There is cute little souvenir shops at the bottom of the parc, near the stairs to the metro. "
Worth a visit,"We spent just under an hour here which was sufficient time to listen to a guide explaining some of the statues and monuments to us and to explore on our own. It was not the traditional park that we were expecting but more of a setting for the statues and monuments. It had been described to us as ‘an urban oasis set high atop a mountain in the heart of downtown Busan’ and there were certainly good views of the city and the sea from up here. There was an interesting floral clock but overall not quite as much ‘park’ as we’d expected. Nevertheless,worth a visit."
Light show,"Nice walk up but if you are lazy then you can use the escalator. If you are even lazier, then take a bus.In April there was a light show at night which was amazing. I was one of the only person watching it, yes, great! More for me.Also did full workout at one of Busan’s outdoor gym."
Small but the flowers were good,This isn’t a very big park and there are a lot of concrete walk ways but the statues are imposing and the view over the city is good. There is an interesting temple that also functions as a soup kitchen. 
Monument park next to Busan Tower. ,Came across this monumental park while we were exploring Busan Tower. Small but the panoramic view of the city and the bay beyond is an awesome place for a sunset pix. The main centre of attraction is the statue of a 16th century navy warrior named Yi Sun Sin. You can reach this place by going up the escalator from the shopping street along BIFF. 
City views at sunset,"We came to Yongdusan park to watch the sunset over the city. It was beautiful but the view was nothing special. Would have been much better from the tower, but when we saw how many tour buses were parked in the carpark, we knew the tower must be crowded and decided not to go up."
Just ok,There is an escalator that will take you up to the park but beware that you must walk steps all the way back down. Also save your money and don't pay to go up the Busan Tower. Go to the rooftop of the nearby Lotte department store and go to the rooftop Skywalk for some amazing views that won't cost you anything.
Good view of the city,"We were taken by the shuttle bus from the cruise port to Busan Station. There are many shops across from the station but we took a subway train on the orange line to Nampo station where there is the Gwangbok-ro Shopping Street. There is a long escalator off the street that leads to Yongdusan Park where Busan Tower is located. There were activities in the park and the Busan Duty-free shop is located there. Unfortunately, we had to walk down to the shopping street as the escalator is one way. There is a Lotte department store nearby with an observation deck for a view of the city."
Nice to hike to the top,There were two ways to reach to Busan tower which was on top of Yongdusan Park: one via the escalators from Nampo station; another one via stairs from main streets which were close to Gukje Market. It was really nice to hike to the top to have a great view to Busan bay and its neighborhoods.
Average scenery ,There was nothing much here. The view was ok. Perhaps u have to climb a little higher to see more Those with elderly folks might have some trouble climbing up and down the many steps. 
Relaxing ,Lots of problem up there just hanging out. Not a very big park but it’s a nice place to take a break from the craziness of the markets and shopping streets 
Little bit disappointed ,"Silence in the middle of the crowded city... Probably it might be Yours expectations... Unfortunately You are wrong. Or maybe I was unlucky. When I was there, was some preparations to the festival, noisy like hell. And why there is duty free SHOP? Somebody could explain me?? From one side, You are reading that is beautiful place and history related to this place and on the other hand duty free shop. For me sorry is not matching. "
Good views,"This place has great views of the city, some Buddhist temples, and some quiet walking trails in the middle of downtown."
Park with Busan Tower,"Yongdusan Park sits atop a hill overlooking the ocean and it is a place that you will need to pass through in order to reach Busan Tower. You can reach this place via an escalator at Gwangbok-dong Cultural and Fashion street.There's nothing much here except a view of the surrounding area and amenities that you would normally expect to find in a park. Benches, shelters, flowers, tress and artworks. Most people pass through this place to get to Busan Tower, me suspects, so if you're planning to visit this place, might as well drop by Busan Tower too.Can include the park and Busan Tower together in your itinerary when you're visiting the Jagalchi and Nampo area."
Great place to start a second time visit,"What a great place to start our second visit to Busan in six years, Yongdusan Park helped to set the mood for what Busan has to offer. There are many great features/ buildings in the park to observe, the main modern iconic building is the Busan Tower, for our family group our interests were to see the beautiful temple, flower clock, gorgeous military statue of Chungmoogong Admiral Yi Sun-Shin (1545-1598) and the views. Yongdusan Park is accessed via a boardwalk and staircases from the street behind or by an escalator from the shops below."
Tower lit up at night ,We stayed not too far from the park so saw bits of it on a few occasions when we used the escalator to get up the hill. The tower was lit up one night when we passed so that was cool. We didn't go up the tower as there is an observatory at the Lotte department store nearby which had quite good views and was free. 
Good park on the hill,"This is a park in the center of Nampo Area. It's good to have a break.- The area is where marine headquarters used to be located in the past.- Locating on a hill, it has a fine view looking down the port and downtown.- There's an escalator to reach. But, I approached from the other side and there wasn't.- There's the tower with an observatory. But, it was not accessible when we visited.- Many street cats. Good place to spend time with them."
Major Attraction,"If in Busan , this is a must. Busan Tower easily dominates the scene with fabulous view of the city & the sea. The park , not so big , but commands vantage view, Flower beds , trees & shrubs make a pleasant outing."
Average view,"Came here in the late evening around 8-9 plus. Did not go up the busan tower. Just stayed around the park. Did not feel that the view was great or anything. There is a big Two-some cafe, 3 levels if I am not wrong. Did not get a drink but might do so nxt time."
Busan Tower,"At Yongdusan Park, there's a place for sight seeing. The tickets cost $8 per person, don't go there when it's foggy b/c you can't see anything and you'll be wasting your money "
Nothing really special ,The Busan tower is a landmark but otherwise the park itself is nothing really special. Easy to access though as there are escalators on the way up (but not down).
So So,"There are elevators to climb the hill from Guangpuk road. It took me 20 minutes to walk from Hotel Foret premier I stayed to the entrance for Busan Tower. To my surprise the price board only showed the price for entry with 3 types of meals so I thought to give up going up as I had just eaten a heavy dinner.The prices were all over 10,000W. I thought twice and asked them if entry only ticket is available and they replied yes and told me 8000w. I still do not understand why they did not show the price 8000w on the price board. The view from the top was so so."
Nice park in the city,I usually stayed at the Last Hotel next to the park. The park is situated in a convenient location right next to Gwangbokro and has some large cherry blossom trees that flower in late March/ early April. Access to the park is really simple; take Exit 7 of Nampo metro station and then turn left. Keep walking until you see on your right an escalator which goes up to the park. There are some restaurant off Gwangbokro if you are hungry.
"A nice park on a hill, with monuments and Busan Tower","Easy access by escalator from 'fashion street', Nampo metro station. A lot of statues and monuments. Cultural shows in open air. Nice view from the tower."
"Nice park, ok Tower ",The park is simple but quite nice. We paid to go up the tower but the windows were dirty and some had a weird mesh like structure on them so this made taking pictures very frustrating.If I am paying for this then the least they could do is provide clean windows and windows which you can actually look through. 
Yoe really have to check this out!!,"This is the 3rd highest peak of entire korea. And whay’s nice with our tour with Steve Kim is that they have complete access to the observatory. They will really deive u up to the peak! U dont need to walk that far and that long! Trust me, driving to the top is better. The view is breathtaking!!! Take this tour as a package with the city tour. The bonus was that, we came during spring time. So cherry blossoms were everywhere the entire ride all the way the top! This was the last stop of our tour. When you come to busan, you need to take the tour because the places you’ll be going are really far from each other and the buses stop at the bottom only. So you have to walk all the way to the top which is approximately a 2 hour hike up. "
Great way to visit all over Busan from the top,"This was my last stop before departing Busan. On a nice spring day, the park provides a great place to take photos and sit around to relax. I visited the Busan tower, which costs 8000 won for the entrance fee but well worth it because you get a really breathtaking view of the entire city and got a chance to see place I didn't have time to visit like Geomcheon Village and get a panoramic view of the whole city. Be aware however, that the steps up to the park and tower are quite steep. I got lost a bit on teh way there and took the wrong entrance up through the back so had to climb through many levels of steep stairs. It was a good exhausting exercise but not suitable for the elderly. Overall it is worth spending 1-2 hours here as one of the highlights to visit."
Yongdusan Temple - Temple in the hills,"The area was in hill but the temple was in beach. You must walked from the entrance to temple (if you went by bus). Taxi or car can enter to parking lot. If you walked on April, you can see the cherry blossom along the road. So beautiful.This Buddhism temple. "
"Peaceful mind, tranquil park, refreshing air and beautiful cherry blossom","From Busan subway station to Nampo station, we took the exit 7, turn left and that is the Gwangbok-ro street. We then continued to walk straight to arrive at the escalator to go up to Yongdusan Park. We saw many locals were doing exercise and relaxing in the park. When we were there, we were lucky to see the cherry blossoms. The air was fresh, together with the tranquil and peaceful surrounding, we truly enjoyed our short stay here."
Free sightseeing in Busan,"Stopping in port in South Korea, there are quite a few attractions to see. When you come out of the port, you need to go through Busan Station (exit 7). There is an information desk inside the station if you are unsure. The station itself has cafes and restaurants. When you come out of the station, you can cross over the road and you will find China Town, ideally if you want to go here, the shops open around lunch time. You can walk to Yongdusan Park, it takes approx 20 minutes and you will see sign posts for the Busan Tower and Lotte. We took some parallel roads which are quite steep and you can see the top of the Tower. There are many paths to the Tower. When you reach the top, you have some great views and pictures. You can pay extra to go up the tower if you wish. There is also a temple, a flower clock along with some additional points of interest. You can then take the escalator and stairs down which takes you to Fashion Street, you may need to go through the underground station. This will then lead you to the Lotte department store (Gwangbok branch). Here you have the chance to shop and buy any souvenirs. However the must see at the Lotte department store is the waterfall feature on the ground floor. Once you see this, get the lift to the top of the department store (11th floor) to get to the sky garden observatory deck. Here you will have some fantastic photo opportunities and excellent views across Busan as opposed to going inside the tower. I would say need need a minimum of 45 minutes to really appreciate the views here. there is also a cafe on the top, you will also be able to see your cruise ship from the sea view. Now if you go back to reverse route i.e. walking towards Busan Tower, you can see sign post for the 40 steps culture and theme street, here you will find random sculptures where you can take great photos. This will lead you back through China Town and parallel towards the Busan Station. To round up my trip, South Korea are famous for their Chile and Cane syrup fried Chicken. There is a small shop just before you head back into the Station, no seating in the shop, they have 3 sizes, a small will be enough to try. Overall these elements i.e.the park, the department store and 40 steps will take you between 3-5 hours depending on how much time you spend at each attraction and all of this is free."
Tower is a Must!,"Very nice park. It’s not crowded at all. I assume it is much better in spring or autumn. Tower has an amazing 360 degree city view. For tower popcorn and drink deal is very good. Total you pay 19500W for 2 tickets to top, large popcorn whic was delicious and 2 large drinks. ( 1 ticket to top is 8000W)"
One of few observation spots in Busan,"We walked here from BIFF square, there were a few routes to get up the hill, we went up the 'drive' way however there was another route close to Lotte mall where there were escalators going up to the base of the observation tower.Unfortunately our visit was cut short as the tower was closed due to remedial works, so we couldn't go up to the top. The notice was not available anywhere online, it was just a banner at the front entrance and a worker at the front door notifying visitors."
Got nice view,It is a few minutes walk from BIFF village. Still you can enjoy the view without getting Busan Tower. You gt a nice view from Twosome place while sipping your coffee. Overlooking Gamcheon Cultural Village. Nice to walk around the park. Ideal to visit in the morning or at night (the park opens until 10pm)
Must do in Busan,"The steps go up and up or you can take the escalators to the top. Once there enjoy the beautiful gardens, temples, tower and take in the views. It is really worth a visit and lots to see and do. If in need there is also free wifi here too."
Worth seeing if your in the area,A very small park but an interesting one as you have to take the escalators up. There is a statue and an observation tower at the top.
Along the way ,Get in touch with nature here and enjoy a view of the Busan Tower! There are convenience store and cafe up there too
Beautifull place,Yongdusan Park is a beautifull place. It offers excelelnt views of the city. Very good for jogging and sporting activities. Highly recommended.
Easily accessible and windy area,"The Busan tower is within the park. You will see a lot of young people here, talking and taking photos. There are love locks here fixed to the surrounding fences and on the roof of the rest areas."
Cool place to chill,"Great view over Busan (especially Nampo) without so many people, especially after 8pm.You can even have a drink or a snack at one of the café or convenience store."
Busan Tower,"Busan tower, 120m, can view 360 degree busan area. Can be access from Nampo by stairs. There will be Busan Duty Free opening soon."
Peaceful and relaxing,A lovely place to visit on hot day.Very Japanese in style with plenty of places to rest in the shade.Can use escalator to go up to but have to walk out.
Its a tower so I have to go up,"Everywhere I go I hunt out the high tower experience for the area. This one doesn't have alot of the ""we are biggest at this that or the other"" stuff at the start, but does try and take that naff photo of you on a green screen and super impose you with a tower backdrop. All for 10000. It was only 8000won for the ticket (unless you end up buying the combo tickets which they will try and push onto you). Good views from the top and a team of cleaners removing the sticky hand prints. we were there on a Saturday and there was no real queue and we were up in just a few minutes."
A great walk with beautiful scenery,"The step up to Yongdusan Park (용두산 공원) was indeed very tiring but a worthwhile one. A popular mountains in Busan, the area is filled with beautiful scenery. Busan Tower (부산타워) standing at 118-meter high is located at the top. The deck of Busan Tower (부산타워) features panoramic view of the area. Definitely one of the popular tourist place to visit when one is visiting Busan (부산)."
A park surrounding Busan Tower,"Yongdusan Park is a park with Busan Tower in it. It is reachable from Nampodong Street, where more young people visit for shopping and hanging out. You can either take the stairs or escalator up the hill. I visited there around sunset time, there was nothing particularly special, just a regular park with mosquitoes..."
Nothing special,There's a tower where you can have a 360 degree view of Busan and a park with some trails but that is about it. Not much one can do there.
Much to See but Much to Do About Nothing,"YongDuSan Park sounds like such a nice park to visit and tour around. They have numerous attractions here like the Busan Tower, the many colorful pavilions, flower clock, and so much more. But many of the tour sites were under reconstruction and/or closed off for remodeling so much was missed during my visit.Although this isn't anyone's fault because it's to maintain the park, my visit was indeed cut short. But once everything opens up again, I'm sure this park will have much more crowds and increase in tourism because there is indeed much to do here.I will be back, Busan!"
The view of Busan city,"I went to here twice, in the night and in the morning. So I can see busan city in the night and in the day. In here, there are so many heart by the busan tower 's side. "
Busan Tower is re-opened.,"Busan Tower has been reopened in July 2017. It isnt a very tall tower in comparison to other towers but you will still get a nice birds-eye view of the city. Getting there is simple as long as you do not miss the escalator which brings you up the hill, as such, keep an eye open for the escalator which is accessible on the right if you are approaching from Lotte Mall. If you are just wanting to visit the tower and not its surrounding park, maybe you will just spend about 1/2 hour in the tower and maybe another 1/2 hour at the cafe beside the tower. It is still time well spent."
Busy Hiking,A short trip on the metro to this hiking location. Nothing too special but nice to get away into nature.
Busan Tower,The main draw card here is the tower which was closed the day we visited. There is a statue and a shrine in park which is on a gradient so not that easy to walk around.Thanks for the vote if you found this review helpful.
Busan all you can see,You can enjoy the ful view of Busan city along with the most amazing and busy street of busanNampo-Dong
Beautiful View of the city,"The Hill is easily accessible by escalator or walking up by stair. The view is nice there and Busan Tower also located on the short hill.Unfortunately, the tower was under maintenance when I was visiting Busan so I didn't get up the tower."
decent place,just a decent park. nothing extraordinary.there's some ahjussi hangin out while playing something like korean traditional chessit is ok just for a quick visit
Closed for renovation ,Title says it all. It was mostly closed off because of rennovation. So maybe check back when they are done. The Lotte mall nearby however has a good food court and great observation deck
Nothing special,This park does not have much going for it. It is mainly a coach park with a few monuments etc to look at and a souvenir shop. We went as part of a city tour. I wouldn't go there again. Nothing special.
Nice place to relax,Park is beautifu place in middle of the city. Unfortunately observation tower is closed for renovation.
Nothing much to see,"There wasn't much to see at the park. I would say only go there because it's along the way while shopping in the nampo dong area. There many old people just relaxing and exercising there. It is a nice place to sit and rest in spring time though, away from the crowded streets. "
Nice Park for both local residents and tourists,"We have visited this centrally located Park via the escalators from Gwangbok Road uphill. Tourists could also come to the Park by coaches direct. Inside the Park, there were statues, bell tower, flower planters, rest rooms, small timber houses and an Observation Tower which should be opened for public but with an admission charge. Nonetheless during our visit there, the white tower was closed and the surrounding slopes were under construction. So we just strolled around the Park, took some photos and have a nice view over the harbor from height. A nice and convenient place to visit by tourists."
Nice park with cherry blossoms,"The Yongdusan Park is centrally located in Busan and can be accessed via an escalator from Gwangbok Road (Gwangbok-ro). One could take Exit 7 of the Nampo metro station and then turn left; keep walking straight for about 5 minutes and the escalator is on the right. The park is not very big but has quite a number of cherry blossom trees, flowering in late March/ early April. It has a tower (with access fee) for viewing the Busan surrounds."
Just ok for me,"Went up at night per tour guide recommendation. But comparing to Hong Kong night scene from up at Victoria Peak, Busan city at night looks like a plain Jane.Obviously it is an unfair comparison. Still worth a little visit when in Busan since it is really close to the shopping streets and fish markets.There are escalators to assist going up only. Coming down there are staircases or streets that lead to the city below."
Nice small park with great views,"This is quite a small park adjacent to the Busan tower. There are escalators taking you up to it (which I only discovered on my way down), otherwise there are lots of steps to climb. The park itself is quite small but has some nice trees and plenty of benches. I went around 9:30am on a Saturday morning in April and there were quite a lot of people in the park - chatting with friends, reading newspapers etc - but it was still serene. The views over Busan were good. There are various things to see as you go up/down the escalators - an outdoor gym, water feature, statues and a few shops."
Fantastic views of the city and the port!,It is a beautiful place with lots of sights. I climbed the tower for sunset time and watched the brilliant city.
View of Busan,The place is on top of the hill. It is facing the harbour which provides a good view of the harbour. You can take the elevator to the top of the viewing to enjoy the city view.Below the hill is walking street. You can enjoy the good view and follow with shopping.
Nice little park on a hill,"From BIFF square, walked eastwards toward lotte mall and found the escalator that bring you up the hill. The park is not big but the tower and Souvenirs shops and tour buses were a sure sign of tourist attractions. Did not find anything inreresting and left after a few minutes. "
Simple but nice,"Around BIFF, simple place, very nice view of the city. Beautiful garden. Nice place to hag around and visit."
Nice little park with cherry blossom trees,Very accessible from the shopping street and take the escalator up. Not a big park and there were a couple of cherry blossom trees in full bloom when we were there. You can also have a nice view of Busan although we did not go up to Busan Tower.
Night sensation,I was coming to this place when windy and cold weather. It is very quite and there are only several traveler. Most of place was closed so you just only have in front of this. you have to climb about 228 stairs before you reach this or another option with escalator
Been here today morning.14/3/2017,"Near to Apple guesthouse..Easy to get the direction from we stayed..Near to Namdong Fish dried market, Jagalchi Market, BIFF Square, Lotte Department Store."
View from the top,The Busan Tower offers a stunning view especially at night. We were there in January so the weather is so cool we enjoyed walking around the area.Ticket is at 5000 won and 3000 for children.There were lots of people (mostly tourists) but it is being controlled by the staff. There is a sky lounge where you can have coffee and don't forget to check out the souvenir shop before you leave.
Good,Yongdusan Park is a must visit place in Busan... here you can see Busan city from top.. must visit!! 
Tons of poke stops and great views but horrible steps,"So there are some great views up here. I didn't go into the tower (we went to the top of lotte mall and it's pretty similar from other reviews I read - and free). There is a bell tower at the top as well. The area was full of people playing Pokémon go. Lots of poke stops. Now the way up to the top of the hill (the park is on top) is steep. You can either take a series of escalators to the top or stairs. There is no escalator on the way down. If you have small children, a collapsible umbrella stroller would be good here but a baby carrier would be better. "
Busan tower is close,"The main reason why Yongdusan Park did not catch my heart is because Busan tower was closed the day I went so all I see is the park with no view. The park itself is below average. The scenery is not that beautiful. I guess if I have a chance to go up the tower, the view would be much more wonderful."
Arguably the best view of Busan,"Situated right in the middle of the Nampodong shopping district is the Yongdusan Park (Mt. Yongdu Park). Do not worry about the way up as there're escalators all the way to the top. Do not worry about the way down too, as it is easier than it seems! (I probably took less than 10mins to reach the bottom)You will chance upon the statue of Buddha halfway to the top, and a huge bell in a pavilion of sorts and the Busan Tower itself.Take time to enjoy the view of Busan from the top. I didn't go up the Busan Tower, but still had a great view of the city.The park isn't very big and I'd say spending 30 to 45mins here is more than sufficient. Nevertheless, its a good place to chill out if you've spent hours shopping ""downstairs"" at the shopping district.If you're unsure of how to get to Yongdusan Park, you just need to ask. There're also helpful people in red ""Information-jackets"" walking around. It's relatively easy to get here once you're in Nampodong."
Nice little park in the middle of busan,Nice and well maintained park in the middle of busan close to the shopping district. Worth visiting and spending about 1 hour.
Meh...,"Easily accessible with escalators that take you up, and apparently a local favorite. The view is not that great from the park, though. We didn't bother going up, but perhaps better from the tower? Timing and weather are definitely important. We arrived just past sundown. I am sure there are better scenic spots in Bunsan! "
Splendid views from Busan Tower,A 'must see' for tourists. Provides an excellent panorama of much of the city. Go just before sunset to enjoy both the day and night view. 
Landmark of Busan,"Busan Tower, a landmark of Busan. Unique synonymous , located in the park just to Yongdusan Park and attractions of the famous city of Busan. Busan Tower, and is open scenic view of the city of Busan below."
Lovely!,One of the best spot I've been to in Busan. This one should definitely be on top of your list as you can see whole Busan way up high from its obeservatory deck.
A park with a view over the city,"To reach the park you go up a series of escalators to a courtyard at the top. It is nicely presented and has assorted statues and topiary. The main attraction is Busan tower, which costs ￦5000 and offers fantastic views of all of Busan. If you can go during the sunset it's really spectacular."
The view,"To get to Yongdusan Park, you gotta be prepared for slopes and steps. Wear comfy shoes and you are set.. The views on top of this park is worth it I promise.. They have an observertory on top of the park but we didn't head up coz there's an entrance fee. For those who are interested, you can bring your own 'love lock' and lock it on the railing near the top.. "
Mixed of historical and modernisation,"the park is on top and the shopping street is below. After you see the historical side of Busan, you can see modern Busan right after travelling down the escalator"
good vibes,a lovely park on top of a busy shopping district! best view and a relaxing mood to capture good vibes
Not much to do here...,"I took the multi leveled escalator from Nampodong up into Yongdusan Park. Note, the escalator only goes up into the park. If you want to go back the same way, you will need to walk down the stairs, so beware of the physical requirements of doing this!I didn't spend too much time at the park. As I recall, there was not much of note to see in the park. Busan Tower is at the center of the park and its main attraction. However, it didn't look very interesting. If you want a good view of Busan, I would rather go to the roof in the Lotte Department Store for a free and probably better view of Busan."
"View of Busan - Culture Village, Sea, Beach and City","I walked from BIFF to Yongdusan Park and I took the looooong elevator to arrive the place. There are a few statues that you can find here. If you have some times while wandering around Jagalchi-BIFF, you will surely appreciate the view that it gives. However, if you are tight on schedule or have better place to go, this is a place that you can skip. Take some times appreciating the view of human-made structures and nature in one picture as you can see clearly the tall buildings in Busan, the culture village, the harbour with ships, the seas and trees as well as the big blue sky."
Good view of Busan,Take the escalator up to view Busan. Didn't go up the observatory but it should give a clear view of Busan. There is a souvenir shop too. 
"Good view of Busan, be sure to take the escalator up",Take the escalator up from the shopping street. Park gives a good view of Busan. If you want you can go up Busan Tower for a better view (5000KRW per adult).
Disappointing,"I was expecting to spend about 1-2 hrs here but was done in half an hr (including time spent shopping at the souvenir shop). There's nothing much to see to be honest - just a couple of statues, a large bell and a clock tower. We didn't go up the Busan tower as we've gone to a similar tower in Japan which has a better view. The place is flooded with tour buses and groups of mainly tourists from mainland china. Most of them are there just to snap some tourist shots and then they move off. Not a place that I'd recommend traveling specifically to."
Take The Escalator,"A long escalator takes you up the mountain (large hill) to the parkOnce there you will see a flower clock, shrines, love locks fixed to the surrounding fences, love seats and a statue of a general.We were there on dusk and saw the lights of the city gradually come on.A 120m tower gives an excellent view of the city. At the base of it there are touristy shops including one selling love locks."
Good place to visit in Busan,"The best time to see Yongdusan Park is perhaps in springtime, ie late March/ early April when cherry blossoms flourish. It has a tower (with an entrance fee) where one could have good views of Busan city. The park is not very big but is conveniently located in the city area, near Nampo-dong. In the nearby streets, one could find a variety of Korean food including ginseng chicken soup. One could readily walk from Nampo station, BIFF square or Jagachi fish market."
A park,"We didn't find anything special in there, it's just like all the observatory-tower-parks in other cities. It's a nice place to relax when it gets dark and see the view over busan"
Relaxing place with views of Busan,"The park is clean and has a relaxing atmosphere. I felt it was just alright, not much activity there, but it offers great views of Busan! Probably if I had enough time to go up the tower, the views would have been even nicer! The escalator was in the midst of maintainence when I was there in Aug."
Pawalg,"It is really interesting place to come and must visit, really near the place where can see all over Busan town. This park is very clean."
Busan Tower,You'll never missed the tallest tower in Busan!Of which you can see the whole of Busan from this tower.Attached with Yongdusan Park which is good for fresh air walk for couples or families.
Great views,Located in the heart of the city on Yongdusan Mountain if gives a panoramic view of the sea and downtown Busan from the observatory on Busan Tower.Look for the escalator in Gwangbok-dong fashion street which will take you up the hill.
A must see park for Busan trademark: Busan Tower,"Walking distance from Nampo station. On your way you can shop at the small shops for clothes, food and cafes. The escalator led us to the Busan park. Taking a stroll around the park and take beautiful pictures. The love locks park was not big but its one of the love lock parks you will see in Busan."
See the City of Busan,"This park is where the Busan Tower is. It is near the BIFF Square. There is a big bell in the park. To go up the tower, you need to pay KRW 5000 or around $5. Up there they have a small sky cafe. From high you can see the Busan CIty all around, you can see the Gwangandaegyo Bridge and other things."
Do NOT miss this nice city park overviewing the city -,"This mountainous park is one of the 'green spots' in the center of Busan. It can be reached by bus, cable care or on foot, for those who are in excellent physical condition and have spare time in town. Best time to visit is around dusk as you can have a fantastic city view at day AND night."
Nice hanging place,"We went here late in the afternoon cause we want to see the night view fr Busan Tower. We accidentally took the farthest route and end up walking uphill to the tower. The view was breathtaking, we sit back and relax. Quite empty but on our way back, we could see local ppl gathered and watched old songs played on a big projector screen. Then only we goes down by the escalator that led us to Gwangbok-ro."
Nice night view,"Went at night, couldn't see much at the park as it was dark. It would be good for a day time activity. The city scenery is worth going up the observatory tower. "
Short hike compared to Seoul Tower,"Busan Tower on Yongusan is not as tall as the Seoul Tower, but you could actually catch nicer view as you could also get the mountain and sea port view from up there, I myself prefer the view here. As my stay is pretty much next to Yongdusan, I am going up the hill daily. And from my stay up to yongdusan is about 5 mins short hike up the staircase. For those coming from the metro, go towards Gwongbok Road fashion street, and you will find the entry from there, there is even an escalator going up, buy you have to climb down later. There is a road for vehicles leading up Yongdusan from the back, near the 40 steps. And yes its CHUSEOK perfect. Afterwards coming down from yongdusan, you can always goto have Ice Cream or Ice Coffee in Gwangbok ro to Gukje Market to BIFF ..."
If you have time ...,"I went to Busan in the period of cherry blossom, so when I went up there were few blooming cherry trees. That's a good place for morning exercise. "
Best Sky View,"Be prepared for a long walk up from Nampo Subway ,get the escalator to go up and take the stairs to come down.There is some underground shopping too.The View looks awesome from the Skytower.The access to Skytower is KRW 5000."
Not sure if it's worth a trip,We went there with guided tour so the tour bus drove us to the top. It would be a strenuous hike otherwise. It was a rainy day so not much to do/see either. Overall it's an underwhelming place. 
Good view of the city,Is a nice park with a tower. You can go to the top of the tower for 5 thousand won and you can great good view of the city. 
Beauty of Nature,"Basically is an island with sea of green. Good for hiking / walk around the island. Very peaceful and good environment with fresh air. Alternatively, you can hop on to the Danburi train that will bring you to each attractive place among the island."
Quite a Climb,"It was quite a climb to get to the park, but well worth the peace and tranquility there. We bought tickets for the tower approximately 4000 won(£2-£3). Great views from the top as its not too high up to make everything so miniscule you cant see it properly. As you walk around everything is signed so you know what you are looking at. There is the obligatory gift shop and small snack shop. There is also a place to buy hearts and locks to tie to the fence with your message on, all legal as well. When we there the escalators were having maintenance done, so you might need to walk up and down"
Good for some time away from the crowd within the city.,"We took a cab to the north gate, walked up the hill in this park to the tower, pavilion, flower clock and bell tower. Its still a worthwhile park to get away from the crowd in the city despite the presence of many Chinese tourists and some Falungang protestors.The flower clock is disappontingly small though.The escalators from this park to Nampodong was under repairs when we were here."
Nice view of Busan from the top but quite a steep climb,"A good place to visit to get nice views of Busan. Not much of a park but nice place to just sit and chill and enjoy the view. There is a tower that you can visit for a fee. The small park has a bell pavilion, a statue of an admiral and a flower clock. The escalator is towards the middle of town side while the back of the park leads towards Gukje and Fashion Street area."
Lovely location,"To get away from the rush of busy and sometimes hectic Busan simply take a taxi to this wonderful park. It is kept immaculate. Really a place to relax and clear your head. Plus you get sights of Busan to be remembered. The park entrance is free, however there is a fee to climb on the top of the tower. Worth trying."
Nice Park,"The stairs to the park is too steep but escalator is functional on my day of visit. We reach there late evening around 4 or 5 so we didn't went up the Busan Tower. The park is well kept and very nice for evening walk / exercising. After sightseeing, you need to walk down the stairs. You can continue with your shopping spree. I saw some beauty shop e.g., Etude House; boutique etc.We went to Etude House and Lotte World for shopping."
Nice respite from the hustle and bustle of shopping in BIFF Square!,"After hours and hours wandering around BIFF Square and Gwangbokro Fashion and Culture Street in search of the entrance to the park, my boyfriend and I finally stumbled upon it sandwiched between two buildings. The escalators weren't working at the time, so it was up the stairs we went! It was quite a trek, but the views at the top were stunning. As for the park itself, there isn't much to take in. Busan tower is located within the center of the park and it was a little underwhelming in person. We didn't bother taking the trip up to the top of the tower. I wouldn't recommend going out of your way to visit this place unless you want to get some good views of the city."
Nice park,"It is a marvel how such a park can be nestled so near to the bustling shopping district at BIFF. This is my second visit, this time round we went to the park from a different entrance as we explored the 40 steps culture street. From the other entrance you would have to climb steps to get up to the park. Not as comfortable via escalator from the BIFF area. Nevertheless it is quite interesting as we realized that surrounding the park, you can sit midway along the slopes to enjoy the park. When you reached the top, there is the tower which we didn't went up. It is a nice place to have a birds ye view of the area. A quiet park to enjoy a few hours of peace."
Average,"The park is too steep for ols folk. Our tourguide van were parked at the foothill and my mum gave up half way walking up the hill. When reached, we saw busses were parked up the hill. Then we realized only certain vehicles are allowed to go up hill. So if travelling with elderly, try ask permission at guard house to drop them at hill top first to skip the climb."
Happening place during festivals ,"I visited Yongdusan park on 22 May 2016, which coincided with the 12th Busan international dance festival. Really hype festive mood! Strongly recommended to visit in late Spring period. "
Best landscape on Busan,"Not sure why this is called a park, rather a nice square on the top of the hill. The main sight here is the Busan Tower. The ticket to the viewing platform is not cheap but worth it! Stunning view on the city and port of Busan!"
View the City Landscape from Busan Tower in YongDuSan Park,"One can view the city landscape of Busan from Busan Tower in YongDuSan Park, both in the day and at night."
Would not call this a park,"In another country you would probably not call this a park. Nothing much to see here, but nice to get the view from the tower."
walk at the Park,it is in the middle of downtown of Busan. To go to the Park you need to climb up using escalators and stairs. Yes stairs! there are parts when going to the park that you need to use stairs :) On top you will see the stunning city view of Busan.
High place but not so much,Just a park on top of the hills. Nothing much to see but u can enjoy the side of a busan city from there. Try to look for the escalator to go up there. From BIFF square.
Easy walk but nothing much to see,"The highlight of the park is the flower clock and the tower. There's a duty free store and some local stalls selling local products. There are local photographer around to take pictures. Other than that, you just need 5 minutes to walk around and said you have been here. "
nice park,"Probably the nicest park in Busan, right at the foot of the Busan Tower. A nice place to have a stroll after you went up the tower. Also a short walk from the port."
Relaxing place to spend some time,We walked through the Yongdusan Park to get to the Busan tower. Because it is on an elevated position we had to get the elevator up there from the street level. Easy to do and fun. It was lovely to see the locals just relaxing and meditating. The pagoda was lovely to look at.Not a huge park but nonetheless nice to spend sometime. Great views and would be amazing to watch the sunset from there. 
Peaceful beautiful park,"Lovely for a walk and to take in the views of Busan. Can have better views if you go up the Busan Tower but we did not. Peaceful and lovely grounds, worth a visit."
Great views of the city in a peaceful setting,I visited just before dusk and most of the tourists and locals had already left for the day.The views are great (even better if you go up the tower) and it is peaceful and away from the hubbub down below in the city. Interesting to read the history behind the park as the use of this area has changed over the years.
Nice park with excellent view for Busan,"The park is easy accessible by metro and with escalator leading to the park entrance. It's free of charge if you are only touring around the park. The park is situated at high location of Busan, you may have a broad view of this city. It is recommended to visit the Busan Tower, the entrance fee is reasonable. In the tower, you have 360 degree to view the city of Busan. I visited the tower in the afternoon which able to see clearly the city. If you want to stay longer, you can buy a cup of coffee at the cafe corner and waiting for the evening view. Though I have not stayed until evening, I think the night view should be in different with the day view. I will revisit the tower in evening if I come to Busan again."
"went at night, did not go up the tower","nothing much to see at night, tower didn't look very appealing. the elevator up the park seems a bit under maintained."
My second visit with fun,"I have been there twice and this has been the first time during the daytime. My visit lasted slightly over an hour and so I decided not to go up the Busan Tower as the cloudy weather after some showers would make views much less attractive. I managed to take quite good shots of cherry trees with the multiple background behind. One uniquely white cherry tree was in full blossoms right behind the flower clock while other pink cherry trees has started to have blossoms withering. There were a few Korean photographers who were selling their service and though very few people turned their customers, to avoid including them in your photos was often a challenge. Since the main buildings (Busan Tower, the pagoda-like tower, the flower clock, the bell under a shelter and the general statue) are quite far apart, including any 3 of them into one single good shot was even a greater challenge for those with camera but without more than 90 minutes like me. There were not too much to do if you are not local Koreans who are more keen on Korean history, but if you like how to enjoy the views from this high level, the cherry trees, the church tower slightly off the slope, the fresh air and the several tabby cats you might have the luck to bump into spending 2 to 3 hours on a sunny day will be a very good idea."
"Short climb, good view",Nice place to rest after shopping or to enjoy the view. Even here the fences can't escape the love locks.
Relaxation Park for Elderly People,"Popular place to see a lot of elderly people spend their time at the park playing their favourite "" chess games"" ( traditional Korean chess games) Another step below -the art stall were also there for artistic gallery & gifts . The Busan Tower loved by the tourist stands magnificent tall at 120M in the park and overseas the Busan city below the observation deck."
Stunning city view of Busan,Worth to spend some quiet time to relax with greenery with stunning city view of Busan. It could be good to do picnic by packing some street snack there 
Good views ,Wonderful stop for some good views. Easy walk down to fantastic shopping and street food. Definitely take the time to hang out and get coffee over the city. 
Pleasant walk,"Get off from the Nampo exit 1, go into the immediate right and walk along till you reach the gwangbok road, turn left and you shall see there is an escalator to your right, it's the easiest way to reach the yongdusan park, or the busan tower. It's a small park but do get up to the busan tower where you will see the panoramic view of the city. Shame the buildings blocked off to the view of the gwangan bridge. "
The View From the Top of the Tower,We climbed the stairs and took the escalators and finally reached the Tower. It was a quick elevator ride to the top for the best views of Busan. I had no idea this city was so big. We took lots of pictures but they just don't show the beauty of this city.
A park that's worth your time,"An easy accessible popular park, it is in the middle of downtown, right on top of Mt. Yongdusan “dragon’s head” mountain. We followed the road sign (painted on top of the manhole cover) and climbed up the nice shaded steps to the park. At the park we enjoyed the great views of the port and the older part of the city. We took a few photos of the Statue of the Great Admiral Yi Sun-shin, the Bell of the Citizens, the flower clock and the pavilion and the 118 meter high tower. It was a refreshing stroll and we went up to the tower as well. If you don’t want to climb steps to go up to the park, there is a one way escalator to help you. But going down, you have to use stairs.The escalator is at the shopping street in Gwangbok-ro Happy Travelling!"
Nice view,You can see the Busan port view when you go up to the Busan tower. Nice place to take photos around here.
"Great place, and good for phots","We went here during lunar new yearPretty place and a lot of photo opportunitiesBe aware of the men trying to take photos of you for a fee, bring a tripod instead..."
Spectacular views from Busan Tower,"This is a must-visit place for tourists visiting Busan. The tower is accessible via high-speed elevators. On a clear day, you get to enjoy spectacular views of Busan city and the port from the observation deck while having some drinks and snacks at the cafe."
Beautiful at sunset,"We visited Yongdusan at dusk in winter. Admiral Yi Sun-Shin was stoically standing guard defending the city from the 'sea pirates'. Alright for a short visit, easily accessible by escalator , suitable for elderly and very young by pram to reach. Just off the busy shopping area of Gwangbokro culture and fashion street. "
Just another park with a nice view,"Just an ordinary park at the top of a hill, you get some good views but the stairs and broken escalators made the walk a bit more difficult than it needed to be. If you want a better view of the sea view I'd recommend walking down to jalachi instead of up this hill. But might just have been a bit underwhelming after visiting namsan in Seoul "
Happy New Year Eve,"We go there for Happy New Year Eve. It is a good experience to celebrate their culture. It is really very beautiful. When 12 midnight strike, the balloon start to release and strike the bell. Later firework come. Great experience."
A look to main Busan ,It was nice. A bit old with only local tourists. I loved the view and I had an idea about busan map. Out side view was much better xD Check my instagram superstylish for more photos of seoul and busan ♡ 
A Nice Stroll And Up The Tower,"The area of the park I was in was nice. There was an uphill path, semi-forested, and there was a market going on at the time too. I also, took a trip up to Busan tower for $5. It's a great view of the city! There a gift shop, a museum/gallery, and a square where one can buy these little hearts and locks to post on the railings surrounding the tower too. At the top of the tower, there is a cafe to buy coffee, ice cream, etc. "
It's the Tower not the 'Girl' with the Black Jacket,"Our Mariner of the Seas excursion meant we came here by coach and not as others by walking.Our interest therefore was dominated by the impressive Tower and its surrounds. Great place for photos; locals picknicking on the ground, the love-locks attached to the railings, the tower itself and the nearby buildings. Best of all take your photo with the Girl in the Black Jacket as a memento of your visit. No matter your age she will keep smiling.A fun visit with some good memories."
Nice park to chill out,This park is situated on a hill right in the city centre. It is accessible from Gwangbok fashion street via escalator or by stairs from Jungang area (near Bank of Korea & Gukje Market). Lots of shady trees & seating areas where you can chill out in between shopping. There is also Busan tower on this hill & a souvenir shop.
Close To Everywhere - Nice View,"It is just located next to the main tourist site and you can go there in the morning or evening via the stairs or escalators. You can also see Busan Tower there and go to the observatory terrace at a small cost to take a full view of the city. In a corner, you can also find love locks hanging (similar to the one in France)."
Huge and beautiful park,"It's pretty hard to find at the beginning although we followed the guidance from Google maps since no sign on entrance, maybe we were too focus on busan tower because that was the main attraction we were looking for. But inside not only got Busan tower but also citizen's bell, love chain lock on side. It's good for jogging around as well, can kill some fat. Next to it is the fashion street but we did a bit of detour since the sign was not well established so we have to walked through long step to go down to the Gwangbok dong fashion street "
Great views,"This park was located right behind our hotel (Tower Hill)and is accessible by stairs or escalator.The Busan tower is here and you pay 5,000 won to be able to view Busan from the top of the tower.The view is amazing and we got some great photos. The escalator access is from Gwangbok-dong fashion street. Closest subway stations are Jungang station exit 1 or Nampo station exit 7."
Nice to visit once,"This park is located very near our hotel (Elysee hotel), just turn right and walk straight and you will see a long flight of stairs. Walk all the way up and there is the Yongdusan park. The nearest station to this park is Nampo station. Take exit 1 and walk for 10 mins to get to this park.It's a very quiet park with free admission. There are Busan tower, exhibition hall, souvenir shop and many more.. However if you want to go up to the tower, you will have to pay. We didn't go up and explore the Busan tower because we are rushing somewhere else.From the park itself, you will be able to have a nice view of the sea. I noticed that there are some photographers out there, but I think you will need to pay for the photos of you taken by them.There are also love locks where lovers can hang their love locks on the fence. Yongdusan park is one of the famous mountains in Busan. It is nice to visit once, explore a little and take some pictures. Don't miss it if you are just nearby the park. Enjoy the nice scenery and seaview."
Wonderful views from Busan Tower,"Get your camera out and head up the tower for 360 degree views of Busan. Definitely worth a visit, it's not fancy decor but the is a cafe up there! It's open at night too. "
Just for a walk,"Is nice if you want walk a bit, there are often shows of typical dance, a Buddhist temple near there and a souvenir shop. Is not the top but this city doesn't offer so much"
Busan landmark,"The park is old korean style. If you go to the tower you can see all the view of Busan in 360 degree. The outlook can also see the beautiful view ,like a pictures. The park is very peaceful for chatting."
Not a must visit,"Boring and little disappointed unless you have lots of time to spare. Good for morning walk/jog, fresh n cool weather in oct morning. Would be better if there were cafes"
Quiet Garden,"This place only 10 minutes from our hotel. We visited this park on late afternoon, so we couldn't exploit this place. Our first impression on this park is a feeling of calm and not crowded. unfortunately we don't explore the Yongdusan tower, we just take a picture and move to other place. Hope someday we can revisit this park."
Pretty good night view,"Busan Tower is just in the middle of the park. Getting up needs 5000 won. Before going up the tower there is a convenience store with some tables and chairs. Pretty good place to chill out. Lovers can hang their love locks on the fences too. The night view of busan is very nice. The bridges, the port and surrounding city view is gorgeous. There is a cafe up there selling beverages and snacks. I went back again the next morning, there are some old citizens doing morning exercises over the park. The park is very nice, well kept with statues and bells around. Overall a pretty good place to visit."
Decent,"The park is pretty decent. It has many entrances; one of them being a trail with tall trees. It looks quite beautiful. It gets a little crowded during weekends, but most weekdays are fine. A lot of retired koreans go up there around noonish. In this park you can go up to the tower. It is not as tall as Seoul's, but it is worth a visit as you can see a lot of the areas around. "
Yongdusan Park in Pusan,"This park is in the center of the busiest commercial area of Nampo, Pusan. This is located at the hilltop of Mount Yongdu. There, you can see around the city center of Pusan and the seaport of Pusan. There is a tower which you can go up."
Busan Tower View,Within the park is the Busan Tower from which you have wonder views of the city. It is worth going up on a clear day and get a 360 degree view. This is one of the special sites of the city.
Decent ,Paid 5000 won entree fee for the tower. Spend good 0.5~1hr on top of this for 360view of the area. Decent place here and lower the expectations and you will be just fine.
Yongdusan Park,This site has the escalator for senior citizen to walk up and enjoy the grandview of the Busan habour however need a long walk down.
A very nice park for people watching,"Yongdusan is in the centre of Nampo, and its a lovely place to have a stroll and to people watch. Also, you can go up Busan Tower (I didnt, so cant comment on that). You can reach the park by escalators from the shopping area down below it. In the afternoon, a lot of older gentleman play Go in the park, and I enjoyed watching them (I have to admit that I had to google to find out about the game and the rules, and Im still not very confident about them :-))."
busan 360 view,"there is near by nampo dong area, fees is 5000won for going up to the top of busan tower, there have a sky coffee shop on top of tower, u can see 360 degree of busan view.... so nice, so beautiful"
Busan's most beautiful park & most spectacular view,"Getting to Busan Tower is a real uphill climb, but the trek is worth it, as is the fee for the trip up to the observation deck. Yongdusan Park is a beautiful little refuge in the midst of the city, with trees gently swaying in the breeze and interesting little memorials along the pathway that leads to the base of the tower. There are nice views of the city even from the park, but the view from the top of Busan Tower is absolutely spectacular; as with so much else, morning or else early evening just before sunset make for the best pictures. There's a nice little gift shop in the tower as well, with relatively reasonably priced souvenirs, some of which rise about the merely kitchy and a few of which are actually quite nice. Afterwards, stroll down to Jagalchi market and take in the waterfront. If the very Korean seafood there is a little too Korean for you, you can always go to the food court of the nearby Lotte Mall for tamer fare."
Busan Tower & Yongdusan Park,"A little gem found in Busan. The park is beautiful and you can go to the top of the Busan Tower for only 5000 Won per adult. Went up during the day, but have heard the night views from the tower are also worth seeing! The tower closes at 10pm. Located in the middle of an amazing downtown/shopping district. "
A must-go spot for traveller.,A must-go spot for traveller if you wanna view the beautiful city and harbour of Busan. The park is on a hill that's not too high.
Magnificent view of Busan,"The place very accessible from Nampodong, probably 10 to 15 minute walk away. Busan tower offers a full panoramic view of the city. Snacks and souvenirs are available on the top platform of the tower.A must see in Busan."
"Great Views of Busan, A Nice Retreat in the City","A great little park in the middle of the city, offering up great views of Busan. Although the tower here is much smaller than Namsam in Seoul, I actually think it has a better view. Definitely worth the admission fee to go to the top (personally I like the daytime view better than at night) and enjoy a little ice cream or drink from the tiny store that they have in the observatory. The park itself is a nice little retreat from the hussle and bussle of Gwangbok-ro itself. Best way to get here is from the escalators that take you directly from Gwangbok-ro up to the top of the park (or you can do the hike yourself), but unfortunately the escalators are only one-way, so you’ll have to come back down on your own."
"Easily located, escalator up","Park is nice, great place to take a few photos with the Yi Sun Sin Admiral statue and stroll around. But waste of money to go up the tower. Not much to see and visibility not that great too. We didn't mind going up since we didn't need to climb the steps.I recommend the Yongdusan Park but not the Busan Tower there. "
"Busan Tower is the heart, but many little things surround it.","Walking up to Busan Tower we encountered many of the traditional Busan artifacts. You have a chance to take photographs of the Citizen's Bell, or watch a performance of traditional Korean music put on by the locals in the pavilion.Busan Tower is the main attraction going up 120m from the ground in an elevator. 5,000 won ticket got me the Tower but is you buy the bundle ticket they have a few other galleries that can be worth seeing."
Wonderful panoramic view of the city from the tower,"Yongdusan park is in city centre, heart of the shopping centre, the famous fish market nearby, Biff square a walking distance. Place is bustling with live and lights but star attraction is Busan tower for a wonderful view of the city."
Best view in Korea,After being to Seoul Tower twice this place was a shocker. The park around Busan Tower is very beautiful and the view from the top of the tower of the City and port is way better than the view from Seoul Tower. It is much smaller and more cramped but it is cheaper that Seoul Tower. If you think the view from Seoul Tower was good you definitely need to visit this place. Definitely plan on visiting again. 
Romancing in the park,"As in Seoul, where there is a tower, there will be plenty of young couples who locked their everlasting love for each other by signing off on the lock and hooking it on the fence. The place is a great place for dating at night. The tower is not as tall as N Seoul Tower and the place is not too crowded and touristy.There is only a cafe where you can have a cup of coffee and some snacks. Overall, the landscape of the park is beautiful with plants and trees well trim. There is a kiddies pavilion and a bell pavilion. There are many statues in the park. From here one can see Busan at night, especially the brightly lighted up Lotte Mall. Enjoy the night scene and the fresh air in the quiet park."
The Town Tower,"The park is quite nice and has nice trees but the view from the top of the tower is very good, and reminded me of the views from the 101 building in Taipei. Not as good as that but still not bad."
Must-go if you like panorama,"Compared to N Tower in Seoul, the Busan Tower inside Yongdusan Park is way better. Perhaps the one in Seoul is too tall, or that Busan has better views - the latter has a harbour, Gamcheon houses in addition to modern buildings, hills and so forth. If you like views from a high point, this park is something not to be missed. The park is free and the tower needs a fee."
Nice View from Busan Tower,"Yongdusan Park features a beautiful garden, the Busan Tower, and some statues, notably a statue of a dragon at the base of Busan Tower. Also, you can find 'love locks' locked y couples at the railings. The observatory at the Busan Tower is not to be missed, nice view from up there. You'll be able to see some of the famous lighted bridge from there."
Busan tower,"If you utilise the escalators this tower is far quicker and easier to reach than the one in seoul.It is a pretty tower surrounded by gorgeous gardens, particularly when the cherry blossoms are blooming. Gorgeous panoramic views over the whole of busan can be seen from the top. Directions:From nampo station take exit 7, go along gwangbok ro street 350m until you reach the yongdusan escalators on the right. "
Grate view,"Good place to have nice look at Busan. You come you, see you, go away happier.Take alot of pictures"
Easily accessible park for a good view of Busan,"The escalator leading to the park is in between rows of shops. The tourist information centre is about 5 mins walk away. It gives a good view of Busan city. If you are visiting nearby attractions such as Jalgalchi market and BIFF, you can visit this park easily."
So Koreanlikke tower.,very cozy and beautiful tower. different from seoul tower. very korean traditional. And you can see all of Busan city. you will like it.
"Great view, worth visiting",Easy to reach from Nampo-dong or from Busan main station. There are even escalators to help you reach the summit. The view over the bay of Busan and the surrounding islands and mountains is well worth the visit.
An oasis away from city life,"I stayed at Elysee Motel which is just a slope down from Yongdusan Park. Didn't take the stairs as the walk up looked quite steep. Instead, I used the escalator from the main shopping street to go up. Very tranquil place and great for an early morning walk. If you stop halfway up the escalator you will enter an exercise area for elderlies. Great way to start your morning!"
Relaxing break from food and shopping,"This park is in the midst of some very busy markets, shopping malls and restaurants in the Jagalchi area of Busan so it is very convenient to get to. There are a few ways to go up if you want to walk or you can take the escalator up at the main entrance and walk down. There is a temple and exercise area midway and at the top is a tower, lots of statues and a temple building with the usual Korean architecture. There are great views of the city and water and if you are a jogger, this would be an excellent jogging route. Paths are lined with trees and the pace is very leisurely, no crowd. It is an amazing retreat right in the midst of all the eating and shopping down the hill. If you are in this area, this is a must for a visit."
Only went once for NYE 2015. Had a blast!,"Definitely worth checking out during the NYE celebrations. The ringing of the bell is cool. Everyone in the park received a balloon which we all released at midnight, which was a cool sight. Added bonus to our visit: we were interviewed by radio station to talk about new year's celebrations in Busan. Couldn't tell you much more about the park, but it looked like a nice place to visit during the day."
A Great Way to See a Lot,"I came here the day before leaving the country to come home after a long work trip. The walk up to the tower was a little steep but pleasant. The tickets are reasonably priced for what you get to see.The elevator and observation deck were a little crowded, but nothing too bad. There is still ample room to see the whole city on a grand scale. If for no other reason, it's worth the price of admission just to get that aspect of everything. I certainly recommend it."
"Crowded, Commercialized, but still Unbeatable Views","This place is pretty much a solidified tourist attraction for foreigners and Koreans alike. However it has priceless views of the city and is a must on a clear bright day. Don't waste to much time there just get in, get to the top, and get those pictures."
"Great Views, Beautiful Park","I decided to hike up the side (skipping the escalator) and was very pleased with the scenery that accompanied the short trek. The top of the park offers a beautiful panoramic view of the city, and the tower is a great photo-op. Is it touristy? Hell yeah. But if you're a tourist in Busan, it's worth a gander!"
clear busan view from busan tower,"with clear sky and good weather... got very nice view from the top of busan tower... yongdusan park itself is very well maintained, clean and beautiful"
Easily accessible ,"From the shopping street at Nampodong, there is a secret passage with a strings of escalator lining up one after the other. Once you finish taking the last one, you are at yongdusan park. "
An easy walk from the main town,An easy walk from the main town and worth a look. Busan is quite a clean and pretty city but not what I would rate as a top tourist destination. There is no entrance fee unless you want to go into the Museum.
Beautiful in autumn,"our motel was in the vicinity, and it so happened the trees that line the road to the park were in their golden autumn glory, and the breeze help lay a thick carpet of golden leaves on the winding path...the sight was simply postcard perfect...besides it is just an escalator ride up from the fashion street in Nampo, and you get to have a birds eye view of busan city at the top of the hill, a good view in the day as well as night. Definitely worth a visit if you are in Nampo."
Aim to get here for sunset!,"There's an escalator up (but stairs down) from the nice Gwangbokro Street (the one with the brass statues on it) to get you up to the park, thankfully - look for the covered escalator/stairs.The park / plaza area is quite pretty in itself with some photo ops - a nice little traditional bell building, and a couple of statues.The main attraction though is the Busan Tower. It's a bit dated, but there's a modern escalator to whizz you up and back down again, and it's really cheap (just a few quid). Some good views, especially at night, from the top. There's even a little refreshment bar at the top, and a souvenir shop back at the bottom (which the elevator operator helpfully guides you straight into on the way out... ""exit through the gift shop"" and all that) which is actually quite good, especially as I'd been struggling to find souvenirs elsewhere.Worth a quick visit for sure."
Absolutely worth the 4 dollars to go up the Tower on a clear day,The Yongdusan park is easy to find and easy to get to being central to the main city . surrounded by some great shopping areas that are packed on the weekend . the Park is relatively small but worth the walk around with the highlight being the tower. At 4000 wan or approx $4 it is worth the money the view is great on a clear day and gives a good view of the city and the harbour . Once you have done that walk down the path behind the tower through the forrest that takes you to some narrow streets filled with small shops and bustling with locals .
night view in the tower,we went to the tower and saw the night scenery of Busan. To be honest it's not very pretty but the entrance free is quite budget so if you have time you can go to this spot
Yongdusan park busan tower,"Wanna see great view of busan city during night time? This is the place for you. In Yongdusan park, there's busan tower. The tower is around 120m high. So you can see the great busan city lighting up...hmm the fee to go up was somewhere around 4000 won.The park is free by the way.How to go thereGo to nampo-dong station take exit no 1. The park is on your right side. You will see buildings on your right. The park is behind the buildings. There is an escalator that goes up all the way to the park. (see map that i attached)"
Very nice place to have a surround view of Busan. ,"Very nice place to have a surround view of Busan. There is Besan Tour 120 meters high. It is on the mountain peak. Thus it has a good scene, even though the tour is not so high. You can see harboe scenery. "
Busan tower,"There is the busan tower. It's just 4USD per person. You can see the busan city and great view of sea, the young do bridge. It's not all of the busan though, good to see :-)"
Its great to spend time here,The environment is clean and comfortable. the toilet is kinda small and crowded during weekends. Best to visit on weekdays
So conveniently located,"We literarily chanced upon the park. We were shopping in the BIFF shopping area, as we walked, we found this escalator that leads up to a temple. As we were marveling about the fact of finding a temple in a busy shopping district, we found more escalators leading uphill. Out of curiosity, we just went up and up. By the time we are at the top, we realized we are in Yongdusan Park!Found the place to be a nice respite from the bustling of the shopping area. You get a bird's eye view of Busan. To get up to the top of the tower, you have to pay a fee. We are quite happy with the view without having to go up to the top. A nice place to spend a a slow 1 to 2 hours while getting some shots."
"lots to see, not much to do.","The park itself is just that, trees, walkways, some flower and bench to sit on. It has public toilet and some souvenir shop. There's also an art gallery on the way to the tower. Within the park is Busan tower. The tower itself about 180m high with 4000KRW entry fee, gives 360 view of the city. There's a cafe bar at the lower deck too incase you want to spend a few hours up there having coffee. Going up the park by foot from street level is easy, there's escalator to help the steep climb. If they break down, you might think about climbing the stairs as the effort might not be that worth it later on. If you are with a tour bus, the busses will park at the foot of the tower. "
Nothing much...,"We went to Yongdusan Park as we have some extra time on our hand. I would say that the park was nothing spectacular. It looks like a pretty normal park. Maybe it will look better in Autumn when the leaves change color.As for the Busan Tower, again it didn't really wow me. The tower is old and really needs a facelift. Once you go up, you will get a good view of Busan. Not spectacular, but good. For the entry price, it will be better to go to other spots if Busan that can also offer you similar if not better view of the city."
Excellent views of Busan,"The only con is that my dslr picked up the imperfections in the window.... Other than that, this park is awesome and easy to reach from Nampo station. There are a series of escalators that lead you to the tower too, unlike the steep hills of Seoul tower (nam san)"
Easy way up!,"Easy access to this park as there are elevators on your way up (but not during your way down, tiring!) You will get amazing view of Busan city from top and if you need more spectacular view, just proceed with Busan tower observation deck nearby. Nice fresh air up there, away from bustling city of Busan, but nothing much could be done there."
An old park that needs facelift,"There are other places in Busan that offer you panoramic view of the city, e.g. Lotte Dept Store, you don't have to come to the Busan Tower just for that especially when the weather is bad. In essence, Yongdusan Park offers nothing more than a panoramic view of the city. Nothing special. Take the escalator from Gwangbok Road up the hill. However, you will have to walk the 130 steps down the hill after that. The escalator isn't both direction."
Great views and peace,"We decided to take a bus and travel on the other side of the island to see this park. It was a nice and warm day, and we decided to buy within-park-train tickets and also walk in the park. We really enjoyed walking at peace outside of the city traffic and noise."
Nice view of the city,You can have a nice view of the city without having to go up the Busan Tower (which is located in the park). There is not much to do here except relax and chill-out. The series of escalators on the way to and from the park makes for easy access.
Great during the Buddha's birthday month,"At this time of the year there are many paper lamps in the shape of Korean figures, dancers, fighters as well as tigers and dragons in the park. Worth seeing at afternoon-early evening- it is really beautiful. In addition there were many booths with games such as wristlet making, cooking making, etc for kids and adults who likes to release their inner child... loved it"
Nice scene to have a look,"I like the views from the outside even though i could not make it till the higher spot , cause is a cloudy and rainy day. I guess i cannot have any nice night scene so i just walk around the park. If is a sunny dy , i bet you can see the Gam Cheon Cultural Village,is behind the tower up the hill only. Spot it!"
Overrated... wouldn't go again,"It's a small park at the base of the park with mostly bus loads of tourists. There's really nothing much to do or see here unless your intention is to put a love padlock on the fences. The park itself is kinda rowdy. But then again, many places can be a downer after you've visited Taejongdae Park!"
Location and Views,Its where Busan Tower is. Its near BIFF and Jagalchi. The park is picturesque and relaxing. Go after a busy day shopping.
Good views of the City and beyond on a clear day!,"This is Busan most popular and famous park, attracting tourists and locals alike. We spent about 30 minutes here as part of a land tour of Busan. The park is 10 minutes walk away from Exit 1 of Nampodong Station. You cannot miss the 385 feet tower that soars into the blue sky offering great views around the city. A gigantic bell also greats you as you come up the drive way. Prominent here in the well-manicured grounds are the flower clock and the statue of Admiral Lee Sun-shin, a war hero, who fought the invading Japanese fleet in the late 16th century and according to our tour guide is a most respected person in South Korea. There’s also a statue of a huge dragon to the right of the entrance to the souvenir shop that sells Korean traditional handicrafts like masks, key chains, wallets, pottery, dolls, pearl fans and more. At the top is an observatory where on a clear day, the entire city of Busan can be seen. Moreover, there are several rest areas as well as a musical instrument museum and a cultural relic exhibit hall in the vicinity of Busan Tower. The Chinese meaning of this place is "" Dragon head mountain"". If you’re looking for Ginseng, the shop has it. Sampling of the ginseng is complimentary.The views can be marvelous on a clear day.Address 35-26, Yongdusan-gil, Jung-gu, Busan부산광역시 중구 용두산길 35-26 (광복동2가)Type / ProductsSouvenir Shops / Korean arts & craftsInquiries• 1330 tt call center: +82-51-1330 (English, Korean, Japanese, Chinese)• For more info:+82-51-245-1066 (Korean)Homepagehttp://www.busantower.org (Korean only)Most credit cards are accepted."
Worth a trip,"This area is also part of the Busan tower area and also can be easily walked to the PIFF or BIFF area. Lots of outdoor clothes shops around.Since taxi is so cheap in Busan, we decided to catch a taxi from Busan station- cost $2-$3 US "
Great view,A best place at night to view Busan night scenery. Yongdusan Park is one of the must go place for every Korea couple. Many love locks and love message have been placed along the fences. 
See it from Busan Tower,"This park is near the Nampo-dong area of Busan, South Korea. Its key feature is the tower, with a fast elevator to the top and two levels of observation. You can see over the mountains. It is surrounded by a very well done park, walking trails, parking, tour bus parking, other attractions and vendors with food and such."
Marvellous view of the port city of Busan,"On top of the Busan tower you get to see the city, its sea port and the surrounding mountainous terrain in its entirety. The tower must have been there for quite some time, it looks old. Local tour buses drove all the way up to the base of the tower which is the Yongdusan park. If you plan to go in the morning, you better be early before the 40 footer tour buses swamp the area with sea of local tourist. Luckily we arrived before the crowd, manage to buy the tickets for the elevator lift to the top of the tower viewing platform which is 109m high above the park.To get to the park you take a subway train to Nampo station Exit 7, coming out of the stair, you will see the Lotte department store on your right, on your left is the Gwangbok dong street, to your left walk 20m is the escalators to the park, doesn't matter if you can't find the escalator, point your sight at the tower and walk towards it, a little climb wouldn't hurt. According to the Chinese meaning of this place "" Dragon head mountain "" this must be a feng shui good location, so go locked yourself and your love one at the park railing with a padlock and remember to write some everlasting phrases on it. In the midst of hustle and bustle, this is one charming park for all to relax and enjoy."
If you're in the area,Worth going to this park if you're in the area. You'll probably catch some sort of cultural performance on the weekends. Go on a day when the sky's clear and ride to the top of Busan Tower. It's a nice view.
Worth visiting,We watched the firework here during the new year. It's very crowded but the views are amazing. I would definitely recommend it. 
God Views,"Paid only 4,000 won to go up the 120m tower. Excellent view from the top. It opens at 9AM. The art gallery is really small but it is free. Has a nice garden. You can take the escalator up from Gwongbodong shopping street."
"Great place to relax, enjoy the fresh air and get a great view","The park is on a hill, walking distance from Nampo dong subway station. Beautiful and spacious park. There are escalators going up but coming down is either the stairs or go round the hill. The park is free but at the peak there is the Busan Tower. Going up the tower the view of the city is fantastic. But I think the night view would be better. "
Cultural events held there,"I was shopping at Gwongbok-ro on Sunday morning and accidentally noticed the sheltered escalator that goes up to Yongdusan. There are actually a few flight escalators before reaching the park. There are some traditional dance performance at the park. Dancers dressed up in colourful traditional clothes, very nice. Not sure if they held it there on every Sunday, quite a large crowd of local audience.I didn't go up to Busan tower as it seems very crowded. Below the tower, you can see ""Lover Locks"", some with note of messages attached to it. This type of locks are common in Japan and Korea..I even saw them at Gyeongju Station too."
Great view,"I would not come here all the way just to go up the tower, but if you are nearby, I would say it's worth a visit especially if the skies are clear!After lunch at Jagalchi market, our tour guide led us through Gwangbok-dong Culture & Fashion Street before arriving at Busan Tower. It was a nice, leisurely walk.The tower looks old (not very big), but it is well-maintained (looks like it just had a fresh coat of paint). The observation deck area isn't huge. However, the views of Busan were great from there!Before you take the lift up the tower (or on your way out), take a few minutes to look at the photos of Busan attractions at the lift lobby."
Busan Tower location at Yongdusan Park,"Busan Tower is located in Yongdusan park. First getting there. Take the main subway line, that is line 1 to Nampo station. Go out exit 7. Do not take any other exit like some brochures might tell you. You will be walking away from the escalators and then forced to climb a steep hill. Once outside, you will be at the beginning of a beautiful brick and stone walking street. It is called Gwangbok-ro. Walk about 300 meters and on your right you will see a covered escalator. Take this to the top and you will be in Yongdusan park. There is a short flight of stairs at the very top. It is a sprawling landscaped area with benches for relaxing and then a short walk up to Busan Tower. As with any City Tower, the views of Busan are spectacular, the mountains to the north and the harbor to the south, Cost for observation deck was 4,000 won. There is a big souvenir shop on the first floor selling a nice selection of Korean handicrafts. Prices were reasonable. Love the masks and dolls. There is also a musical instrument museum which was closed when we were there. Additional charge for entrance. I visited during the day, but I imagine the view with lights at night would be just as beautiful. The escalator that brought you up is only one way, so you must walk down, but half way down is a coffee shop and Korean restaurant and a Buddhist temple. A worthwhile and recommended visit when in Busan."
"Busan Tower, Yongdusan Park","The Tower is 120 meter high with an observation deck. a ticket to go up cost 4000w and it is not expensive compared to many other towers in other countries. When you look out from the observation deck the view and scenery is beautiful. The best time recommended is about 5 pm you can view Busan at day light and sit around an hour + until 6.30pm when it get dark you can view Busan in night scenery, You will view it in day and night scenery.Places near Busan Tower are within walking distance - Gukie Market, Jagalchi market, BIFF square, Gwangbokro Shopping street. In Korea cosmetics products are worth buying value for money."
tower is worth it,The views from the observation deck show a lot of Busan. Great overview. The city at night is lit up .
Enjoy the city views,Easily accessible fro subway and 4 flights of escalators to reach the park. Free entry. Cost 4000 Wons to go up the Busan Tower to enjoy panorama views of the city. Cool!
Excellent detour right in city center,"The Park is right in the heart of Nampo-dong. A series of escalators take you from the street level right up the hill slope to the base of the observatory tower. The park at the hill top offers a good city view and plenty of benches for a quiet rest. It was interesting to read the short love notes with the locks placed around the base of the observatory tower, supposedly to seal the couple's love. Such interesting romantic notions and creative idea. This is definitely worth a detour from a day's shopping at Nampo-dong."
Lovely,"I visited the park twice. The first time was at night and it is at night that you can see the surrounding areas lit up. Also, you can see the changing light (of different colours) of Namhang Bridge. The cool wind made me just want to sit, relax and enjoy the quiet night. During the day, you will be able to see the surrounding areas very clearly and have a nice walk in the park, covered with trees. Also, I paid a visit to the Art Gallery, which opens from 10 am. Nothing much was displayed but arts are always nice, at least in my opinion. The entrance to the gallery is free!I don't mind going there again ;)"
Quiet,Nice quiet night view of Busan city and Busan Tower. Not very crowded and a nice stroll up hill. Those who are lazy can take the long escalators. 
You should visit the Busan Tower,The Busan tower is a must on your to-do list. It is located 5 minutes from the international market in a nice park. There is a great panoramic view of Busan from the observatory floor at the top.
Fantastic find!,This is a must do for sightseeing in Busan. It's a beautiful little park and the observatory tower is amazing. It's very affordable to get in the observatory. The deck before the observatory is a cute place for couples to have a sit and watch the city. We stumbled upon Yongdusan accidentally in the middle of a shopping area...what an adventure! 
nice little romantic park,"after walking uphil from our hotel, we found this nice little park with lovey dovey feelings as there's a lot of love symbol around. not really a korean drama viewer, am not really familiar with the exact meaning of those love symbols/statues, but overal ambience is really nice. lots of photo opportunities."
"If you're coming here, you must go UP the Busan Tower for the View!","This is a park where there is a building tower that you can take an elevator to go up to the top to see a panoramic view of the entire city. Pretty high (but not high enough that I got uncomfortable. Don’t like heights too much. ) If you are going to this place, you must go up the tower to see the view!If I’m not mistaken it’s around 4000 W (or $4USD). Some interesting places in the park. Not that much, however.Near it is a bridge with a lot of padlocks of sweethearts. It’s similar to some other European bridges. The padlocks are attached to the bridge to show or wish for unbreakable love. Keys are then thrown. (At least that’s what they do in Europe.) However, I’ve never seen a bridge like this in Europe. This is jam packed with padlocks!"
바둑 Baduk and 장기 Janggi Played Here,"The elders play these two games around the benches at the top of the hill and seem to be very competitive, but friendly, when playing. Baduk is the same as the game ""Go"" and Janggi is ""Korean Chess"". The statues of Admiral Yi and the dragon are impressive. There are also several areas for sweethearts to congregate and the views of the city are nice. Take the escalator up and walk one of the paths down to truly appreciate the area."
Best views over Busan,"This park is located centrally and is an easy walk within town. From the back (brown street signs indicate direction), follow the wandering paths up through the trees to the top. From the front (city center), take the escalator to the top. Although there is a tower with a fee (about $4 US) to an observation area, the regular platform at the top of the park gives great views and lots of photo opportunities. Be aware that the escalator only goes up, so the descent involves a long stretch of stairs that may be a challenge for mobility impaired visitors. Of course, a taxi also is an alternative. The park appears safe.The park features a huge ceremonial bell in a gazebo; unfortunately, it is not possible to swing the timber and ring the bell. Great place to take a photo. The week we visited for the second time, they were preparing for a festival, featuring lighted larger-than-life figures of people from an earlier time.Tip #1: Up the stairs from the gift shop by the tower, there are very clean, free rest rooms - better than those just out in the park.Tip #2: For navigation, note the large statue of a historical figure: his nose points at the entrance to the escalator going down."
Must-see park,"This park is situated just off the main shopping street . A lovely oasis with walks , interesting statues and temple. Celebrations were under way for Buddhas birthday with music and many lanterns put up for the 17th may. Panoramic views of Busan. There are areas in the park with outdoor exercise equipment ."
"Scenic view, worth a visit.","This was our first stop in Busan as part of our cruise. The place is very well maintained, clean and gives a wonderful view of Busan! The main attraction here is the Lotte Tower, but we didn't have the luxury of time to check the view from the top. There were a lot of good photo opprtunities though. I loved the heart shaped metal bar where people can leave locked love messages."
Worth going up the tower,"The main feature of the park is the Lotte Tower, from which you can get a good view over the city. The cost was fairly modest (worth it for the lift!) and the view was great. It is also worth going onto the roof of the Lotte Department Store, which has a model of the tower on it and you can view it and the real tower in one go.There is also an interesting little ship museum in the park - an eclectic but decent collection of ship models."
"Worth the 4,000 won for Panorama","Believe me, the view is fantastic on a clear day! I have been to many panorama, this is certainly a good one. The glass wall is quite clean, so you will get good clean pictures of the Busan cityscape."
Made you want to embrace Busan,"Not packed, and with a very visited feel, I have to admit I loved visiting Busan Tower. Nestled on top of a slope, with romantic lights and wonderful golden view, it showed how wide and beautiful the area is. They also sold the dedication tiles like seoul tower. If you have an hour to spare, do drop by, head to the observation deck while drinking coffee or eating ice cream. Write a note to yourself or with your loved one. It did not even have the crowded feel and the rush. It would even seem nice to read a short book up there ;)"
Lovely views.,Took the elevators up from Fashion St. on our way from Jagalchi Fish Market to Lotte Dept Store.It is a nice enough place to spend a short time and good views on a clear day.The Tourist Center had a good selection of souvenirs which was useful as S Korean souvenirs are not that easy to find in Busan.
Good overlooking view at the city center,"It is located at the famous fashion belt of the city heart, at the top of the small hill. The Pusan Tower , Tourist Shopping Center, Museum, Bell Tower, Cafe and observatory deck and exercise field can be found. That is a long escallators connected by few sections together. Only several minutes walk from the Nampo Metro and the underground shopping street. Nice to take a break after hours shopping."
Scenic slope,Had a good jog...along this scenic path. There is a small temple with a bell and gong at the top. you also get a good view of the city from the top.
Mediocre,"I am sure that there are other places that offers better sights and scenery. The place was quite boring. A few statues here and there and also it houses the Busan Tower. Personally i feel that it is a tourist trap. I would rather spend time going to the broadwalk by the sea, or the Namsan Tower in Seoul"
