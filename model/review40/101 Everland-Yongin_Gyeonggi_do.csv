So much fun,"It was my first time there, me and my friends had a really good time, we enjoyed the rides even when we have to wait for more that 1 or 2 hours, but it was worth it, and the the parade show was amazing too, colorfull and really nice, the gardens are just beautiful, i like it too because if you are in Seoul to get to Everland just have to take non stop bus in Gangnam Station."
Much better than expected,"So many beautiful parks inside to explore. One day is not enough. Really huge.. amazing. I especially love the rose garden and Amsterdam theme food street. Better to line up for the popular rides later afternoon so lines are shorter. The shuttle bus we booked thru Klook pick up is early at 630pm, not enough time to explore all. Tip: the zoo closes at 6pm, best to plan your route"
Everland,Went there with friends and their young family. The teens enjoyed the rides once they passed the 1 to 2 hours wait. As the season was into late October-early Novenber I find the blooms in the gardens have all wilted already.
One of the best,"It was our first time to this theme park even though we have been to Seoul 2 other times. To be honest, we enjoy it very much! Once of the best theme park we have visited! It has few different sections. The one we enjoyed most is Zootopia!"
Safari zoo is the most interesting! Up close and personal indeed ....,A theme park worth visiting. Need to allocate one whole day. Best and cheaper to take public transport. If not remember to book shuttle return services. Good to go during autumn as whether is cooling and waiting time is short. Don’t need Q passes (save $$) 
Forever young!,"If you plan to visit this place,make sure to prepare to walk, walk and walk! Get a chance to see the well taken cared of lion, zebra, tiger, panda, giraffe, flamingo and many others. It's a theme park and a zoo in one beautiful place. You must allot 1 day to enjoy all the activities in the park."
Theme park is forever fascinating for children,"Younger outdoor theme park and safari compared to the 20-year old indoor Lotte World. Nevertheless, it is still very fascinating for young children. Located at a huge valley with several sections: young children section at the entrance level, cable car downslope with more thrilling games and safari at the end. Because it is outdoor, better go on warm sunny days. Weekday mornings can avoid long lines."
"Great park, great view, great time","Having visited few international theme park such the universal and Disneyland, I did not harbor any expectation on the visit to this renowned theme park both local and abroad; I was impressed. For the price paid, you get more, much more, very much the worth and value, when compared to the big shots out there. The park is vast and wide, the landscape are wonderful, photogenic in many possible angle and many possible perspectives. While certain park either only suitable for kids , or too extreme for young child, everland has activities and rides that are just nice for all age group, from toddler to elderly. "
Better reach early and prepared for long waits,"There are actually some clue to visit Everland.It is suitable for family and also youngster who love challenging games.Let me share my experiences..We reached Everland at 950am but the queue outside the main entrance is super long and we actually worry that the queue after seeing that.I advise all of you to purchase tickets online first whereby online purchased is cheaper and you can actually skip the long queue.Then, if you are able to reach before 10am, first place you should visit is animal or lost valley first because they are alot of parents bring babies and family and their main aim is to visit animal.So first station we were actually queue for about 1 hour only. After that, we went to Panda which is no queue needed, then we went to kids zone to relax awhile first. Then we went to the Z Line which is the most popular ride in Everland and we managed to queue only 45mins. So please dont listen to others which taking 1-2 hours for all rides. That is not true. But please make it on weekdays.So overall is good, really worth to try it and have fun!"
Too long wait times,"Everland is a dated version of Disneyland. We went on a Wednesday and it sure is packed even on a weekday. Most of our day was spent lining up for rides/attractions. If you don't have the patience to line up an average of one hour per ride/attraction, skip this theme park. Not a lot of restaurants inside the park. Good thing you can bring your own food.Tip: Purchase your tickets online so you can skip lining up at the ticket booths under the scorching heat of the sun. Get a Q-Pass (express pass) if you can."
Beautiful,"This place is huge! It really cater to the different age group. The queues for the rides are pretty long. But glad there is a big garden for people who doesnt take rides. When we were there, the theme was Halloween and it was nicely done up. Heard there the winter theme is even better. "
Everland Family Trip,We went to Everland middle of December 2018 (3 adults and 2 kids).. We enjoyed the safari the most. Animals were interactive. 
better to vosot during the week days. expect extreme waiting in most rides and entrances on weekend.,"almost all Korean citizens use various discounts such as certain credit cards brand usage, online social commerce stores such as Coupang, Tmon, etc."
Overcrowded,"South Korea doesn't offer that many single day activities for tourists and even for locals, so the pressure on this theme park is beyond imaginable.I went there on a working day but believe me or not, still very much overcrowded. At one point the waiting time for the T Express roller coaster went over 3 hours! Apart from that other rides are ok, nothing special. Don't expect to enjoy all the rides because of the long queue. You can check out 4-5 rides max. It is really exhausting to stand in a line for so long time to experience a sub-par ride. So plan accordingly."
too many people,too much hype on this themepark. not so much to see and so crowded. i didn't even get to ride on any rides. some of the rides were closed due to maintenance. we wasted our day on going here. nothings special. won't go back to this place anymore.
Trash theme park with false advertising,"We came all the way from Jeonju to go to Everland and I couldn’t have been more disappointed. My main issue is none of the rides we came to see for the Halloween event were open. Horror maze, horror safari and various other rides were all ‘sold out’. We found this out when we arrived at the park - what?There is nowhere on the website or booking where it mentions you need to buy these rides in advance. I think it’s a complete cop out to spend so much money on a theme park where all the best rides are reserved and you have to pay extra to get onto them. We were told “everything for today” was solid out BEFORE today. That was never communicated and it’s a total joke to call the park Halloween themed if you can’t do anything Halloween related. We couldn’t find anywhere in the park to buy such tickets. Not that it matters because apparently we never had a chance of ever getting in there. There is only about five other rides which all had waits of over 2 hours so it’s really a completely pointless park. 99% of the park is taken up by crap restaurants. Awful use of space. Zoo portion was kind of disgusting with the small areas for the animals who all looked depressed and miserable.Literally the worst theme park I’ve ever been to."
Overrated ,"The parc look nice and the wooden rollercoaster is really fun. However, I felt bad for the animals in the “safari”. The space for each of them is extremely small, the elephants looked kind of depressed facing the wall . The cheetah for exemple didn’t have the space to run at all. The waiting lines are quite long and the fast pass is working only on one attraction in the parc. They aren’t that many nice attractions for adults. It’s also crazy that some of them are not free!I guess it’s nice to go if you live there in Korea, otherwise if you’re visiting for a short time, I wouldn’t really recommend you to go.."
Best of Korea,This our 2nd time to visit this place. Everything is just perfect except for the weather. We will go back again next week.
Knock it off ,"Yes, Everland is considered the knockoff version of Disney, but I never thought that. It has its own charm and I love how they decorate. The park is clean, it has moving sidewalks!!! I recommend making this an ALL day event and see the Animal Kingdom first! "
Must come if you like amusement park ,I went during the discount period so the ticket was 28.000 won. The park is so big with a variety of attractions that are suitable for every ages. Going there during a rainy day but the park is still so lively 
Great time. Worth the visit,We decided to do this on a Monday hoping the queues would not be to long however we were wrong. Most rides we were waiting 30-60 mins to ride. So my recommendation is if you can spend all day from 10-10 do it. Once inside the park food and drinks are reasonably priced. We were very surprised to find out if you have a certain debit card from a South Korean bank you can get up to 40% off your gate admission. Everything was clearly marked and fairly easy to find. Only thing that was weird was the rides all opened at different times as well closed at different times. So we arrived at 10:30 only to find out there was like 3 or 4 rides open and more opening between noon-3. 
Everland on chuseok with 2 kids,"We went on 1st day of chuseok. Surprisingly the park is crowded with their locals (instead of foreigners). We managed to conquer all the areas for kids at ease within 8hrs (including the Zootopia, most rides at the magicland and the Halloween themed park/garden at European world). There's a 50% offer for foreigners staying in Korea. (*the coupon usually avail few days nearer to chuseok. And although we r not staying in Korea and can't produce the residency ID, we try our luck to approach the staff at grp ticket office, they are very kind to oblige us with the offer). We also enjoyed the parade at 430pm. We compared the safari world at everland Vs that at Bali safari, we find that everland safari world is slightly better cos there's brown bear and more tigers and lions. But they're rather similar. Hence if u hv been to Bali safari, u may want to skip this to save u at least 50mins queuing time. We queued around 15-30mins each for rest of the rides at magic land. We din try any of the thrilling rides as they're not suitable for family with young kids but I saw the queue was quite long. Do pay attention to the weather. Their weather forecast fluctuate a lot the days before we went even until the morning we were on our way. Yet, it's not accurate. It predicts to rain all the way to 6pm but luckily, we took the chance and turns out it din rain until 7pm (complete reverse of the forecast). We din take the direct shuttle or subway+bus option as we can't confirm if traffic will be bad from seoul-yongin or gangnam-yongin during chuseok. Our hotel staff also can't confirm. We took subway all the way from sungshin women Univ to everland, transfer like 5-6 lines and took us like 2.5-3hrs (not recommended if u travel with strollers). But it's totally worth the trip. My whole family enjoyed everland very much and we took lots of nice instalgrammable photos. :)"
Everland Theme Park,"Everland is similar to Disneyland. Huge and beautiful, lots of rides for kids and adults, nice landscaping and decorations. You need whole day to enjoy it most. Parade and fireworks are around 8pm."
Beautiful place,"I visited Everland twice, once during winter and another during spring. Both times were very mesmerizing to me! Even if you are not a fan of rides or roller coasters, there are other attractions such as the zoo where you can take the bus tour to see bears and tigers and many food stalls. But I do think the snacks sold at food stalls are different depending on the season as I was unable to find this corn snack during December period. The T-Express was very fun and sitting on the gondola at the end of everything was relaxing. Did not stay for fireworks as I heard from a tour guide that it is not worth it."
Great day out,Visited everland with wife and 2 teenages had a great day the T express is a must go on ride the pandas were great to see along with the chimps and orangutans would recommend a visit if your in souel.
Cool Safari Park,"The main highlight of the visit is the safari ride, the animals inside are quite impressive. T-Express looks really exciting but i did not get to ride. Overall the staff was friendly and with energy. One cons is many restaurants are closed during our visit"
Beautiful place,"The park is full of fun and worth a visit, prepare your camera and prepare to bring back tons of photos"
Great Panda House and rides,"Definitely not Disneyland or Universal Studios level but also worth the visit. The rides are fun, especially the tall wooden roller coaster. It’s even better than some of the other roller coasters I’ve tried kn the bigger theme parks. The panda house is really quite amazing, you get to see them up close unlike in other panda enclosures.The landscaping and gardens around the park are really quite nice and good for photos as well. All in all highly recommended. "
Full Day Entertainment,"This is about 90 minutes driving from Seoul in a very beautiful area. It consists of three parts Amusement Park, Water Park and Zoo. Do not miss the Safari Tour its included in the ticket. Very nice games in open air, therefor, make sure to check the weather before you go. The have the steepest wooden ride in the world. Nice places to take pictures all around the park. There are express buses from Seoul for about $12. If you visit Seoul do not miss this place."
Everland Theme Park,It would take DAYS to see everything here! It is like Disneyworld. The animals are a must see and so is the T-Express! Best ride of my life! Great arcade games with helpful attendants. Awesome hamburgers and beer for days! Go here and you will not be disappointed. :)
The ride of my life!,"If you are into fun fun thrill adventure, you must try their T-Express. It will definitely scare the hell of out you. HahahaAnd don't forget to witness their Bomb Bomb Man performance. Super enjoy.Many rides to choose from."
"Everland Resort, Seoul","Go to Everland for an adrenaline charged fun full day. There are five themed zones – Global Fair, Zootopia, European Adventure, Magic Land, and American Adventure. It's a magical place for both adults and children. Go early though, as the queues for rides are long. Don't miss the T Express if you love roller coasters as it's the 10th fastest and 2nd highest wooden roller coaster in the world. The Mystery Mansion and the VR rides are cool. I love the Lost Valley and Safari World. If you like to get wet, enjoy the summer water fun. And if you like Parades and Floats, stay till night and experience the delightful fantastic parade lighted up with thousands of colorful lights. My favourite place in Seoul for sure, so don't miss it."
everland theme park,"It was quite a disappointed visit. I was there with my son few days ago. All the rides are limited to heights and weights. Weight cannot be more than 100kg and height cannot be more than 153cm. The only rides we enjoyed was safari only, but safari the guide only speaks in Korean, foreigners like us don't really understand what they are talking about. The food was good. For those who wanted to visit Everland, should go there to Q for tickets as early as possible as it opens at 10am and if possible buy ticket via KLOOK or TRAZY. Everland is quite far from Seoul city. When booking tickets online, try to book bus transfer at the same time. Travel on your own to Everland is hassle"
Fun for all,"This is one place you should not miss If you are on a kids holiday. If I were a kid I can easily spend a week here exploring the entire park slowly and taking the rides I like over and over again. Trust me if you can look beyond what adults want and just give kids a good time, this place is all you need.The park is well organised so walking from area to area is easy. Plenty of toilets and also baby help areas make this park very kid friendly. Summer time heat can be scorching so bring a hat and water bottles."
Great rides and excellent service,"While I think most of the adult rides are considered common these days, the T Express and Thunder Falls stood out for me. Thrilling and physically tolerable for an average thrill-seeker like me.The staff e.g. the ride attendants and cleaners were friendly. They made us feel welcomed. "
huge and a bit confusing,"This theme park is so huge and many people visit it even on weekdays. Invest on a Qpass. The waiting time was longer for famous rides.The place was a bit old though, many stalls have been closed. Fortunately you can bring food from outside.Getting from place to place was hard though, even with a map. We spent more time with the animal attractions, and some conditions of the animals were saddening. Some animals did not look happy and others lived in really small compartments. The rides were fun though, the crew were really hyper.The fireworks were the best i've ever seen - compared to Japan & Hong Kong's disneyland fireworks."
An awesome theme park for kids ,"Various rides available. Some not suitable for those with weak heart. Kids would really love the petting zoo rides, Panda house, and roller coasters. A day filled with just scary laughters...."
Fun,Everland has MANY rides and zoo. There is interactions with animals and overall have many activities for kids. It is a good place for families.
Could be great,"We went Everland April 1, 2019. We were staying at seguemdaeum jongno-gu. We missed the bus to which will only cost us kw85,000 for 9 people for two way, so we decided to just renr a car which is doubled of the regular bus fare.But it was a great help though. The place is big, a lot of wonderful scenery. A lot of activities but one thing that disappoint me is that it has a disadvantage for foreigners who can’t understand their language.Hope they could have translators or workers that can entertain different nationalities."
A day picnic,This is a children/adult theme park. A good place to spend a day. Tickets not very expensive as per international standard and offers a good place to visit and spend a day. Has many kids activities to keep them busy. Also offers a ZOO inside
Nice Theme Park and Zoo experience,"We really set aside 1 day for Everland, we got a promo which included bus transfer and tickets, which we printed out and it was scanned at the gate and we entered. This was on a Monday, to try to make sure there aren't going to be big crowds. We arrived 10am, and we sort of had a plan, go to the top rated rides first before it gets too crowded. The problem is, we got bogged down when we went through some of the exhibits like the Pandas, small animals, Seals and Sealions, etc. that when we got to the first ride (Lost Valley) there was a queue already, it was worth it though, then we went to Safari land and there was already 30 minutes waiting time according to a lady at the entrance we still went through and it only took maybe 25 minutes and it was again worth it. By the time we came out, the park was already full and the average waiting time was 20minutes or so. The next on the kid's list was the T express, they were quite strict with the height requirement so the youngest couldn't go, those that didn't want to go went to look for Lunch. We ended up at the Burger place, which only offered I think 3 kinds of burgers, and the chicken wings were spicy (for those who can't take hot food). Those that took the T Express found a Korean restaurant which actually offered food that wasn't spicy, and they loved it. It was unfortunate that we were not able to watch most of the shows, as most of the family wanted to do the rides. There were quite a few rides that were closed that day though, which was a bummer. The Raptor ride looked like you had to pay for it, but I'm unsure. All the shows are in Korean anyway even the 4D ride, but we still enjoyed it, as the action is still fun and interesting. The Parades are also quite nice, the kids even complimented it by saying that the dances are better than some of the Disney parades, because it seems like it was choreographed so that kids can dance along. This is high praise from my kids who are advanced ballet dancers.My only negative feedback is that the park is not flat, meaning there are some very steep areas, my Mom was in a wheelchair because of her age, and I really had a work out pushing her around, They did have ""walkalors"" in some areas though. Overall it is a fun place, however we went on a regular Monday morning and the crowd was still big, and lines was still a bit bad, so I can't imagine how bad it would be during weekends and summer holidays."
Disneyland Korean Style!,"Everland has been around since 1976 but it is fantastic the way they have kept the place maintained well. All the rides are functioning, the zoo attractions seem new. You just can't imagine the place is already more than 40 years old. In contrast, HK Disneyland has only been around since 2005. One of the best attractions for me was walking through the flower garden. It's nice to see them all in full bloom. The place is very relaxing to stroll around. To maximize your stay, I suggest arriving at 10am when they open and stay until 10pm when they close. There is two parades, one in the afternoon and one at 945pm just before the fireworks display. The parade of light in the evening is more fun though. The place is relatively clean and well kept. I do recommend getting a stroller for 5000 Won(1000 deposit) if you are travelling with very small children. (my daughter was 2yrs old) You will thank me for this, believe me. Your small child will not have the energy to remain awake for 12 hours straight. If you do visit in summer, you may consider bringing umbrellas since the summer rains can just come without warning. Overall, it's a good once-in-a-lifetime experience, or you could just go back again to experience more of the park. We definitely all had fun despite being there for 12 hours. Look out for group discounts to maximize your visit and also so there will be a chartered bus to take you to and from the theme park."
Trip to Everland,Safari World and Raptor Ranger were very interesting attractions. Kids really enjoyed the T-Express. You may choose to bring food and drinks if kids are too picky but you can also buy from the park as prices are also very affordable. Not a fan of the popcorn but the soft ice cream was delighful.
Roller coasters are fun,Only took 2 rides: the T-express and the other roller coaster. Both were really fun ride. The T-express was probably the longest roller coaster ride I’ve had so far and definitely the highest droooooop too! The other one (Rolling X-Train) was also fun with it’s two 360 degree loops and three (or was it 4?) continuous bounces that’s going to keep you off of your seat. Best of all is that the lines seems shorter than Disney’s.
fun day with the family!,"the park was huge!! there is most definitely something for everyone in the family. the park is massive and very prettily decorated. staff and park attendants were friendly and energetic. queues for rides were generally okay and the t-express while longer than the rest, was a really fun ride! overall, it was a great way to spend a day with the family!"
"Lines, lines, and more lines","We went to enjoy some rides at Everland with our friends and their 11 year old daughter. We were able to ride only 4 rides from 10 am until 4:30 pm. The lines were ridiculous! We read reviews before we left mentioning long lines, which is why we arrived early. Clearly, that didn't matter. I will admit that paying that price for only 4 rides was NOT worth it!"
Must go Safari World,"I booked the shuttle bus package including entrance ticket & express pass for Safari World, very worth it. The bus picked me up from Myeong Dong directly to Everland, took only 40 mins - u can save time instead of taking the subway.You have to take the Everland shuttle bus when u arrive at the bus terminal. It's fast and convenient although there's long queue. The Everland shuttle bus is very frequent and there are lots of them - don't worry.Avoid weekend - I went on Saturday, very very crowded, all the rides have to queue very long. I had express pass for Safari World, so i didn't need to queue for this one.Safari World - good experience to take the safari bus and had close interactions with the animals (tiger, lions, bears)Restaurants - need to queue a bit but it's all under control.Overall it's a good experience, the theme park is quite big and you will need to spend full day here."
Good for non-thrill seekers as well,"Came here by booking with Klook on a day tour and we have only got a 5 hours to spend here which is kind of short.On a weekday here, it was still crowded that we got to Q for at least a good 20 mins for those non-thrilling rides... The Q for the T-express ride was at least 2 hours on the app. Can't imagine the Q on the weekends and holidays. Everland is great in a way that it allows those that are not a fans of thrilling rides to enjoy the theme park as well. Such as the Lost valley, Safari tour and the area with lots of flower to enjoy. Did not manage to ride the carousel and the tub ride with water splashing.Got a quick bite @ KFC too which is quite expensive as compared to Singapore.Tips: To download the Everland app which shows the queuing time at each attractions. There is also the express pass that one can use which I'm not sure how much that costs. As part of the tour package, we only got one of the express pass."
T-Express & Rolling X-Train (Must go these rides),"Overall the theme park is pretty good. The 2 roller coasters that every thrill seekers must go on are T-Express and Rolling X-Train. The lines can be quite long for these rides, up to 2 hours per ride, but they’re worth it. If you come to this park in Spring, it would be better to prioritize these rides before lunch time. Most likely it will rain in the afternoon. For admission tickets to the park it would be better to get them from the internet/mobile app to avoid long lines at the ticket counter. As for the kids, there’s zootopia in the park that they can enjoy. My kids love the cute animals, but I was told the place can get a bit smelly. "
Fun at Everland...,Spring at Everland captivates my heart...filled with cherry blossoms and tulips! Aahhh! Heaven! The themepark is sooo big that you really have to spend the whole day in it.
Wonderful Theme Park,"we went to everland on last Jan 2019 as my kids loved the theme park. Although the wheather are super cool, they enjoyed the rides Happily. It had garden with many spots for taking picture. Our trip was ended with beautiful firework."
best theme park ever,"Must visit place, the roller coaster is amazing and worth it to try it even always full of queues, I like the atmosphere very cheerful and coloful"
T Express,"Came here for 2nd time last March. Love fhe Tulips festival. And also I came here this time to try their famous T-Express, and it was superb !! ( last easter 2016, I came with my 5yo twinboys, so there's no time to try the T-Express.Other rides are regular just like other themeparks."
Beautiful and complete entertaining park,"It is a big park. the tulips flower are so beautiful... But it is not so comfort for older visitor. When we cam it is so over crowded, we can't enjoy anything :(( only the tulips garden"
A fun place for people of all ages (minus boring moments due to long queues),"Our family went as part of a group tour and visited Everland on a Thursday. It has really great rides and attractions such as roller coasters, different rides for all ages and even a safari. I rated this the lowest in all the places we visited because of the following:- Too crowded, as early as the entrance we could already see droves of people in front of the park even on a Thursday.- Long queues, because there were too many people in the park. It obviously results in long lines in most of the rides and attractions in the park. - Inconsiderate staff, my son was not allowed in one of the roller coaster rides because he was fat. But upon looking at the other people they allowed it was obvious that they base it on looks and not objective or have factual basis for not allowing him. I would understand if he did not pass their standards for safety. But that is totally not the case. Even with the crowd if you are persistent and patient you can enjoy the park. You just have to devote a whole day at this place. A few hours will not cut it IMHO because we only had 3 hours since we are part of a tour.."
First time to go and play at Everland,"This is the first time that Me and friends go to amusement park together and I think some ride is waiting for a long time to play, it's waste the time to play other ride because it is a big theme park everyone will expect to play every ride and I hard to go cause this theme park is far away from city. And also some staff or some restaurant cannot speak English well it hard to communicate."
Too Crowded!,"I am writing this review while driving back from Everland. I think it’s not worth spending the time and money because it’s overcrowded. Expect to wait for a roller coaster ride for about 2.5 hours or even more on a workday which could be exhausting. Especially if you add the annoying teenagers who are waiting in the line with you. And the whole park is full of noisy teens ...If you don’t mind visiting two to tree attractions (max) in one day, then the park is worth paying a visit. Another thing is, if you want to skip lines, you can’t. The thing is you can’t even buy the q-pass in the park because you have to reserve it at least a day in front.The information how to get there and around is a bit hard to find.If you still want decide to come and you are a foreigner you can get a discount at certain times (check at their webpage and ask for it where the group tickets are sold). "
Loved the roller coasters! And book the shuttle bus!,"We decided last minute to visit Everland and got our tickets through kkday website at a discount with the QR code which enabled quick entry. We struggled to book a shuttle which I would highly recommend! And after many emails, we eventually called the shuttle company at 7am and was advised to go to the bus stop and purchase a ticket which we did and successfully got our return shuttle tickets for 12k won each. Everland was much fun! It is huge and like all amusement parks, lines were long, especially for the roller coasters where we waited 1.5hours+. Great day out in Seoul and the light show at the end of the night was a great way to wrap up the day along with the shuttle back to Seoul saving us a 2 hour trip if we were to go public transport. Ohhh and how could I forget to mention the pandas! And tigers! Great for a family day out."
Spring outing for a weekday ,"I followed a friend’s advice, visiting the park on a weekday and buying the Q-pass so i could ride the T-express roller coaster without waiting in the queue. I am glad that i did, because even on a Thursday the wait in line was over 80 minutes long for those without the Q-pass. The animal shows were hosted in Korean language so keep that in mind if you’re taking non-Korean speaking guests. The park is not at the level of a Disneyland park or Six Flags park but its very popular, a good place to do some leisurely walking and the T-Express is a blast. Give it a go - on a weekday and with the Q-pass!"
"Sunday visit on Easter weekend holiday, BAD CHOICE","I think we came at the wrong time to Everland, place was nice but man was it overcrowded as the whole of Korea must have come on top of the overseas Tourists. We lined up with the hordes for the park to open up and then as soon as it did, everyone ran like crazy, 1st place we went was Zootopia as everyone else was running to it, Big mistake, it took us nearly 1 hour and 45 mins of lining up to get on the tour bus thinking we made it and can relax and see animals, what a waste of time, the tour bus around the animals was around 5 mins long where you dont even get to interact with animals like the giraffe where the tour guide feed them a leaf and thats it. After that its a long walk and everywhere is long long lines to enjoy a few mins only.If you like standing in long lines than Everland is a place you will enjoy lol"
Beautiful Theme park,"The good theme park for tourist, not only children but also adults. Lost of food store there. I like most T Express and tulip flower garden.Recommend for all ages"
a good theme park,this is a good theme park in Korea. Our best experiences here are the safari ride where you have a closing counter with a lot of tigers lions and bears. We saw also a beautiful tulips garden which is very good for picture taking and our kids rode their roller coaster which they said was a great experience. There are a lot of restaurants inside the park and different souvenirs shops.
Really Fun Theme Park,"I loved this theme park, the rides were great especially the T-express despite the queue being really long. It was family friendly with the safari and all which was pretty cool. The place is huge and very popular among locals and tourists. Definitely, a place to go when visiting Korea"
Overated,"From reading the reviews we decided to go to Everland especially to try the T-Express. We thought it was just our luck that the ride and many others were closed but found out from fellow visitors that this often happens. Despite the place not being crowded, the closure of many rides caused queues on the ones opened. My kids only managed to get on 2 proper rides. Overall I did not think it was worth the money."
Cool Theme Park ,"Loved this park . There was a time when they would rule the family concept attractions until the ones by Disney and Universal came along in Asia . But that doesn’t deter management, they persisted and in fact it is one of the well attended theme parks in the world. We tried the safari and the lost valley . It was entertaining, mostly for the kids. We visited the Tulip Park , which opens only during spring . My spouse enjoyed it thoroughly. Later we all realised that we are pressed with time. Just a reminder , their roller coaster is one mean ride. Go try it. Place is well maintained, very huge and ran by nice people. Very popular with locals , and I can understand why . Look at some of the photos . "
Huge park with fun rides,"Went there mainly for my kids due to their love of amusement parks. Wasn't expecting too much though, but I was pleasantly surprised. The park is huge. Was expecting something like Universal Studios Singapore size, but it was as big as Dreamland in Gold Coast. Make sure ur legs are strong as you will be walking quite a distance. A tip though, is that they have cable car rides there and you can save some time and energy by knowing the links so that you can rest your tired legs. This way you can get to the end of the park by using the cable cars instead of walking the whole distance, as the area is quite hilly.The wooden roller coaster is a must and you will need to go there first as the queue will get longer throughout the day. Early morning it was 20 mins with by lunch it was almost an hours wait. And all this during a non school holiday weekday!For those with dietary constraints i.e Halal food...none sold there, but what we did was bring food of our own, which is allowed and we just ate our packed food.The lockers are a must and they are quite cheap compared to other places, so stuff your large bags there and enjoy ur walk there.There were some maintenance works during our time there on some rides but fortunately not the ""good rides"".Overall though, not bad, not bad at all."
Entertaining,"Good for family, friends, children and child alike. Better to go here in shuttle service coz when you commute its so hassle that a lot of transfer and coz you a lot. I got a chance to see panda in 3rd time.. lucky that I witness their tulips festival so cute flowers."
Good place to play ,"The theme park is very big and it has many interesting attractions not found in other theme Parks around the world. There were many food outlets ranging from western, Korean and Chinese food. Staffs were friendly and the atmosphere there was pleasant."
Thrilling theme park,"Everland is similar to Hong Kong’s Ocean Park. There are both animals and rides in Everland. Some of the animals that are in Everland include Giant Pandas, a Red Panda, Golden Tamarins, Lions, Tigers, Grizzly Bears etc. I recommend going on the bus ride where you can get real up close to a variety of animals. There are rides which cater to both children and thrill-seekers. Overall, Everland is an amazing place to spend a day at. The park is roughly one hour away from Seoul’s city center, but there are a variety of ways to go there."
Local Fun Day,"Everland is similar to Disneyland, though it really has a local vibe. There are many rides, both for kids and the more thrilling ones for grownups. We went on a Tuesday and it is not too crowded. Go during the weekdays with lesser crowd. Shorter queues for rides. There are many youngsters and I was surprised to see most of them are Korean young couples.Most of the staff operating the rides are youngsters and I am mighty impressed by some of them. There was a ride called Peter Pan. Basically riders sit in small boats which go round and round, clockwise or anticlockwise and of varying speeds. The young lady operating it was singing and dancing every time the ride starts till ends.There was a light and fireworks display at 8.30pm. I understand there is usually a parade but unfortunately, there isnt one on the day my family went there. The show was great.I had a lousy experience at the end of the day. After the show which ended about 9pm, we were walking thru the place to the exit and we passed by a gift shop. As we saw there are still shoppers, we went in hoping to buy some sourvenirs. I was trying to buy an Everland T-shirt. I asked a salesperson and she pointed me to a section. I went there and saw some T-shirts. Beside the rows of T-shirt wwas a cashier and there were 4-5 staff standing behind the counter. I took about 3-5 minutes and took a T-shirt to the counter. The staff looked at me and said counter closed. I asked if I could pay at the other counters and he said no. Does it make any sense to allow customers to browse the items when the shop does not allow any purchases? I would appreciate the shop staff to tell me when i walk in and not make me lose time and also giving me the moment of joy of getting what i wanted and then throw me to hell with a ""no"".It may be the weather, but some stalls and rides were not opened. I hope it is not business as usual for Everland.Besides the last part, my family with 2 boys(14 and 8 yrs old) enjoyed ourselves very much. "
Everland theme park day visit ,"Visited everland park with my wife and kid. Was an amazing fun filled day for the family. I booked via indiway which included a drop and pick up facility, which was very convenient. The theme park is massive and you can easily spend the entire day there. Visited on a weekday so the park was not very full and could do all the rides easily. The rides and shows caters to both kids and adults and the entire park is very kid friendly. Would highly recommend a trip to everland theme park during a Seoul visit. "
Good hangout for couples,"Everland is like the Disneyland of Korea, except that it focuses on Koreans only. We didn't really mind, because we could just rely on our maps and get lost. The reason why I say so is because their commentaries and announcements over the PA system (even the shuttle buses) were made in Korean language only. For a big theme-park that caters to tourists, they should really consider adding English to the system. We visited the park in Winter, and tried the Snow Buster plus 7 other kiddy rides. The T Express was operating that day, though we didn't dare to give it a go. You can see that there are lesser visitors, which is a good thing. Food options can be a little limited ~ you get KFC, burgers, churros, popcorns, and that's just about it.For 8 rides in total, lunch, and lots of walking, we spent 7 hours there."
"Everland is fun, yummy food and great spot to relax and chill!!!","I love Everland!! I came here with my friends, and we all had a blast! The rides are nice and amazing. The roller coasters are not bad, not too scary for me, but not bad either. I like to think of myself as a thrill seeker, and I have been to more scary rides in my country; but the rides in Everland are a thrill in its own rights!!! The theme park is designed with beautiful themes, and decorations in every corners. If you want to have a thrill day, go see Everland!"
T Express...where your soul tries to escape your body,"Literally gave me neck and body ache after riding...never again ride...a must try for thrill seekers. Make sure you don't have cardiovascular, skeletal or muscular problems... my neck won't know where to go for awhile I was teary eyed...especially when you are in front seat. It was a blast! Expect the unexpected..."
Enjoyable rides,Worth going but maybe in summer time due to a number of rides being closed because of winter season.
"Not very big, but fine to spend 7-8 hours there ",大年初一擔心很多商場和餐廳不營業，所以一早訂了愛寶樂園的門票和shuttle去體驗一下寒流籠罩下的everland。乐園距離市區約四十五分鐘車程。坐shuttle抵達停車場後，還需要再轉乘園區的shuttle到園區門口。一下車便感受到羽絨和两條褲子仍無法有效地抵擋刺骨寒風。於是我們一進園區就躲到souvenir的shop去warm up...後來才發現門口的這家店應該是最大最齊全的souvenir shop了。我們與小朋友們玩了幾個簡單的機動遊戲就搭纜車到山上，結果發現了“冬季限定”——滑雪場。小朋友們按捺不住內心的激動，立即要求玩這個項目了入口處分為110cm以下及120cm以上的場地，120cm那邊更高一些，要搭乘扶手電梯上去才能滑下來，玩家得有足夠的耐性才行。之後我們再去了動物園，猩猩和猴子超搞笑，十分了解游客的心思，無論玻璃或隔離帶都無法阻礙它們與游客互動嬉戲。十點開園，在KFC吃了午餐，玩了些機動遊戲，又買了些souvenirs，6點出園回酒店，時間剛好。
Good Theme Park,"A good theme park for everybody, it was like a Disneyland. I found out it is the largest theme park in south korea. We visited during winter, some rides are closed. Lots of food stalls and souvenir shops too. We were not able to go to some areas since it was huge (maybe two days in everland is okey). It was cold but don't worry because there are lots of heater lamps available in some areas where you can stay for a few minutes. Everland has fireworks display but we never witness it because according to locals only in weekends (we go there on weekday, sigh). I recommend it for all ages."
Extreme and perfect,Nothing much to say just perfectttttttt All the activities and ride and anything that they provide very satisfying I LOVE IT SO MUCH!!!!
Nice place in summer,We visited this theme park once during Winter it was too cold we could not enjoy the rides due too the weather some rides were closed.Last year I had the chance to visit here again in Summer and it was fun.All rides were open and we were having fun.Ticket price is reasonable for a big park like this.If you plan to visit by public transportation you can take the metro from anywhere in Seoul. But there's no dedicated station for this park. You have to get off at the last station and continue by bus provided by the park (free of charge)
Fun! Fun! Fun!,"We and our friends decided to meet one more time and go to Everland - South Korea's largest theme park! So we took train going to Gangnam, looked for a bus going to Everland Theme Park, Gyeonggi Province. Took another bus going to the entrance of the theme park all around 2 hours. The transportation fee for all of these costs about 6,000 won (Php 300), one way, per person. Entrance fee to Everland Theme Park is 45,000 won (Php 2,250) per person. However, since it’s winter, rides and attractions are closing early so you need to know what attractions you would like to prioritize. But I suggest you go to Safari World and Amazon Express plus the Panda World. I was here for the Christmas festival and the display of lights were superb! There were lots of kdrama scenes also shot in this area. We didn’t get to go to the Caribbean Cruise since we wanted to go home before 8pm. The park closes at 9pm and we were afraid that people will flock the bus stations going home."
Awesome Experience,"Our trip to Everland was one for the books! We had an amazing time. There are many restaurants to choose from. Lots of entertainment for the children and the young at heart. It is a great place to visit when in Korea. Never miss this out! For the oldies, need not to worry as they provide wheelchairs. There are enough spots also where you can rest and just sight seeing. November is the perfect month to visit. "
Awesome place to visit,I had a great time spending the whole day here. Lots of amazing rides and fun too. It was light raining when I arrived there and the main attraction are closed to the public but I was lucky when the rain has stop and they open the gates for the roller coaster. I had a great time here. Will visit again in the near future
Fantastic,"Everland is by far the only Korean theme park that I've been to. We purchased discounted tickets from Klook.Since it was New Year's Eve when we visited, there was quite a huge crowd of people. I was able to see pandas for the first time here!!!! They also have a lot of food stalls and restaurants inside the park."
FUN!,We spend the whole day at the theme park which full of FUN! Will for sure visit the theme park again if we are travelling to Seoul.
Just big with no excitements - But good for families with children,"DISCLAIMER: I live in Yongin area. So may be underrated because of many visiting.Not fun. Not many thrilful rides. T-Express is almost only one that excites me. But if you're family, it's good. There're plenty of rides for children. There's a big parade(with Samsung's money that parade is wonderful). Only flaw for family visitors is no specific theme. "
Xmas in Everland!,"Visited this family theme park with high expectations and was not disappointed. From the beautiful gardens, to the colorful Xmas decorations to the many animals attractions. Everland was able to cater to multi generations and different age groups. Do note that certain rides will require a longer queue time than others.Food and restaurants are functional and slightly pricey. Expect to spend around 4-5 hours here "
Must Try The T-Express!,"Everland is another theme park in South Korea that you can add to your itinerary if you’re seeking some fun and thrills. A two-three hours drive away from Seoul, you should definitely plan for a whole day out here and set out early in the morning. Although signages are in a mixture of Korean and English, verbals instructions are typically in Korean. Housing South Korea’s first wooden roller-coaster, the T-Express; you should include this in your bucket list because it happens to also be one of the world’s steepest and fastest roller-coasters. The T-express is also inevitably the most thrilling ride at Everland theme park (if you can conquer your fear of riding this, you can easily conquer the rest of the other attractions).There’s also attractions that are children-friendly; including a safari with animals like tigers, lions, grizzly bears, otters, and etc! It’s like a mini zoo on its own and if you take up the VIP experience (which is pretty pricey), you get the opportunity to be upclose and personal with some of these animals.Food and beverage there are reasonably priced and there are a couple of options available. However, we also noticed that not all food outlets are open. As for souvenirs and merchandise, some of it are pretty expensive (in my opinion).The street parade that takes places in the evening though isn’t really my cup of tea but do stay on for the spectacular fireworks show because that is really worth waiting for."
Great outdoor theme park,"Bought the admission tickets through Klook and bus tickets through kkday. The bus picked us up at Seoul Station and dropped us at the coach area after 45 min ride. Transfer to the main entrance via a free shuttle bus.It was winter during our weekday visit and since Xmas is around the corner, the park was filled with the festive atmosphere. Christmas trees, carols, santa.... The queue was reasonable at most of the rides except for the more thrilling ones. We particularly enjoyed the safari world where you toured the opened zoo in a bus....At the winter area, you could also enjoy snow sledding.... Price for the food was reasonably priced and tasty. An enjoyable day for all. Better than Lotte World in our opinion."
Fun for family from young to elder!!!,"This theme park is the most exciting and biggest theme park Id experience in my life. My children enjoyed to the max! Everland has theme park ride ranging from kids to adult! Everland is big with its own Zoo in it (White tiger, black bears, lions, giraffe, wild goats...and many more) The facilities in the theme park is greatly allocated from eateries to restroom to lounge. You will never feel tired and bored at all!! My family loves it and definitely will be back for more!"
magical,"loved the atmosphere and the vibes, just that its pretty far from Seoul! didn't manage to ride the T-express though, because the weather was horrible."
Full day at the park!,"I went here on 1st Jan 19 which was freezing winter and also a public holiday. The park was not crowded and I did most of the rides I wanted within 5-15mins. The more popular ones were at most 20mins. The place is huge and despite not going on “every ride”, it still took me a full day; not forgetting some areas were closed due to winter. I got here via shuttle bus and reached about 1030am. Most of the attractions and restaurants do not operate till about 11-1130. I had my brunch there and the price was decent, ranging between 9,000 to 14,000 for straight forward Korean meal. You might want to consider having or packing breakfast. The park has a “zoo and safari” plus “theme park”. The zoo and safari itself is worth the price of the ticket. You can take a safari bus - included in the ticket - and it takes you around to see the tigers, lions and bears. At the zoo section, you can even feed monkeys by buying food from the designated vending machine. However, it’s not a full zoo thus the variety of animals is limited. The theme park area features a few roller coasters, high-tech VR rides, standard merry go round, fun fair type rides and big gardens that caters to everyone of different ages. For winter, there’s a Snow Buster where you can speed down the snow slope. Loved that!Getting there I settled for shuttle service. (There is public bus option and via train - both requires about an hour or more and were also too much a hassle for me). Easiest way to reserve the shuttle is to ask the hotel to help you call the agent. Tell them you like to go to Everland and everything’s done! No online mess. They might even help you get same day shuttle. Please note that you should reserve your seats. Shuttle is operated by what I assume is the authorized agent. From Seoul city area, the timing to pick up are between 9-940am depending on the area. The alternatives are Klook or directly via the Everland website which provides a link to the agent with all the details. I believe they might eventually still route back to that same agent. To-and-back trip is 12,000 per pax. You will pay cash upon boarding the bus. They will give you a “ticket” and you need it for your return trip. Where you dropped off, is where you will be ride back. Tickets Avoid buying at the door which is much more expensive. If you booked the shuttle, you can get the discounted ticket from the bus conductor. You can also buy online even right outside the park and that will still save you a sum. "
Big theme park,"This place is very big. Bring your own drink. Many snacks stalls there. And gift shops sell cute things that you cant resist. This place suits for family. For bonus, you can take lots of pics too. Not many visitor in winter."
Nice adventure park for families ,"This park is a combination of adventure, zoo and ski/snow playground, their collection in the zoo include a big tiger, pandas, penguins and sea lions."
Highlight: T-Express,Recommended to ride the T-Express first. Sick ride *2 thumbs up* but unfortunately our picture wasn't taken due to problem with system. Zootopia definitely worth visiting too! We went on a weekday so less crowded and more opportunities to take pics without photobombers. Booked online on Trazy for round trip + Everland tickets for cheap (got free KRW5000/pax coupon for booking between Oct-Dec and no minimum spend required to use the coupon).
A Korean version of Disneyland ,"Came here on a winter weekday, thus generally crowd was relatively lighter. In general, it was an all-rounded theme park that appeals to most ages. A wide range of F&B available too that should appeals to most palates. Toilet facilities are aplenty and the equipment are generally well maintained.It is a theme park that we would have enjoyed better if we actually knew some Korean since all of the attractions like the haunted house or 4D experience has the company conversation in Korean (despite the subtitles). But it did not dampen our enjoyment much. We came with young kids so rides like the T-express was given a miss (anyway the wait was more than 1 hour longl). Zootopia was engaging enough for the kids especially the two Safari rides. Short of perhaps criticising the way animals are treated (feeding the animals from the safari vehicles so that the animals come up close to the vehicles), it was still an enjoyable ride for kids and adults alike. Rem if you want to get the Q-pass, u cannot get them at the entrance. U will have to plan ahead and decide which rides u want to Q-pass it to bypass the queue. "
Everland Theme Park/Zoo,"My first visit here in Nov18. Booked my admission tickets+ coach return transfers from Klook.Coach includes pick up at Myeongdong early morning and return at either 630pm or 830pm back.We missed the morning coach thus took public trains to Everland. Journey is very Long took near to 3 hours by trains, conclusion best take the coach which takes only around an hour drive. Theme park is huge which includes a portion which seems like a zoo. Managed to get up-close and personal to animals when you take the Safari buses inside. Tour guides are entertaining in the tour. There are many rides here too for the thrill seekers. Multiple restaurants are around the area for you to grab your meals. Prices of food is reasonable, not highly marked up like other theme Parks.Beautiful Christmas decorations and feels very festive. Goes very well when the weather is very cold too.Theme park is very far off Seoul, place is not super crowded filled with both tourists & locals. Seen many students too as there’s school campus nearby. Would be ideal for families too, as kids would love the idea of seeing animals here.Would recommend to visit for a day trip of fun. "
Better than Lotte World,"We opined that this is better than Lotte World. Just that Everland is entirely outdoor. We went on a cold day, and it was freezing. However, arriving at 10am, many rides were not started as yet. Some only start at 11am or 1pm. We ended up wondering around without taking rides for quite a while, only realising later on that we should have headed to Zootopia for the morning. Several of the tours in Zootopia are magnificent, up close and personal with the animals.The night parade at 6:30pm was good too. And the fireworks and light show at 7:30pm was definitely worth the wait in freezing cold weather. "
 Cold day out but no crowds,"We went on a weekday in November. It’s a bit of a trek from Seoul but worth it if you can start a little earlier and ok to stay after dark. We found that there weren’t many lines and even when there were, queues moved fast.Managed to go on all the roller coasters which was quite fun but not as extreme as those you May find in Japan. Also lots to do for less daring people and children.There’s also quite a range of shops too which may appeal to some. Prices aren’t cheap. For tourists, bring your passport and download the app to get a discount on your ticket. "
Everland Full Day Trip,"We have spent a wonderful day at Everland, enjoyed the rides, shows, beautiful Christmas decorations and lastly the fantastic fireworks!"
More than a theme park,"A large theme park indeed. We made our trip to Everland easier by pre-purchasing ticket and transportation online (Klook). We tried to avoid peak periods but I doubt if there is an off-peak period. There are paper maps available at the entrance,I suggest you grab one. Be aware as well of the day's programme being flashed on the TV screens."
Excellent theme park!,"Everland is a theme park for all ages, young and old. One of the highlights was the intimidating T-Express, with its trademark 77 degree drop. I could remember my friends and I regretting instantly once the ride had started, but once it ended we had to agree it was one of the best rides we had ever taken! Absolutely thrilling!"
It is different to Everland.,This place is really looks like Jeju ilands so i love it . really this place is Love museum i advise to other people please visit ones a time in this place it is near to the Hongik University.
Theme park that's orginally Korean.,"A theme park by the Samsung company, Everland is truly a magical place for both locals and foreigners.I love how Korean this theme park is. The characters used in all - over the theme park is of Korean origin. I really love Zootopia. It features an amphibian vehicle that allows visitors to see animals. We were the last group to take this tour during our visit. It was even fun because the darkness of the night adds some mysterious ambiance to the trip. The tour guide also is so passionate and enthusiastic. Though she spoke Korean all throughout, we were able to join in through her enthusiasm. We passed by the ""Zombie zone"" and it really brought chills to our spines. I love how the theme park came alive at night. It gave me a lot of mixed feelings and emotions which made me happy, excited, amazed and scared at the same time. But would I love to go back? Definitely!"
"Excitement, entertainment - its all there!","One of the best themeparks, there is everything here. From extreme for the young, to the less heart-throbbing but still entertaining for the elderly. Must go to the Safari where guests will be driven into coaches entering into areas where lions, tigers, bears, hyenas roams freely. The huge grizzly bears are a sight to watch as they are trained to beg for biscuits by the coach drivers.A good tip is to bag seats close to the driver so that you get better views."
"Zootopia, not to be missed if you have young children. ","We enjoyed Zootopia section as there is a mini zoo (and animals are at extremely close proximity) which is much better than any other zoo. There are some fun and educational rides (all explanation in Korean). There are quite a lot attractions for young children as well, we had fun. Just to advice.... We were there end of autumn and beginning of winter, it was extremely cold and need to have more layer of clothes. Food is good (there is a noodle shop at the entrance area). "
Fun themepark ,"We spend one whole days for our Nov trip. tips provided online is accurate. Rush to T-express when u step in. Else prepare for the long q even during weekdays [you can either pay for the Qpass to skip Q Or maybe try around 8pm weekday] personally felt that Rolling-X Train is more fun! For young kids, I felt most of the ride is a bit rundown and old. Was disappointed that most show is not in English. Get the ticket Q from the machine outside the theatre before you can enter.Tried the pork curry don and kids meal at one of the restaurant. It's was yummy! Impressive! Disappointed to see that the food alley is under renovation.Fireworks display was impressive with Xmas theme. Parade was fun to watch."
One of the best themeparks for teenagers,T-express was one of the most thrilling rides I have ever been on! It was an almost perpendicular drop from a great height. The rush of adrenaline during the ride was really enjoyable. There are many other children-friendly activities too! It is definitely a must-go attraction in Korea!
Great Theme Park for All Ages,"This is a great theme park with activities suitable for all ages. For the thrill seeker, there are plenty of exhilarating rides. As I came here with infant, we spent most of the time at Zootopia where there are many animals from different continents around the world. There is also a safari which my daughter enjoyed it a lot! Definitely a great place to spend a day for fun!"
Best amusement park for me,"When I was young, maybe 5-7 years old, I went Everland very often. At that time, my height was too small to ride dangerous ride like a roller coaster or haunted house. However, now I can try all kind of ride. I like Everland because in there we can try many kinds of thing. For instence, we can try a safari, zoo and other rides. The best thing in Everland is that is halloween, rose festival or other things. Everland try to do many kinds of festival. Therefore, we can enjoy many party or festival in here. Next thing that I like is T-express. T-express is one of the roller coaster. It was made by wood and the highest height of this ride is 56m. Before I can't use it because the day before that I went, it was rainning. So, if I can, I want to try it !!"
Nice,"We visited last October 27, 2018 (Saturday) through a travel agency. We did not really enjoy it because of limited time from 3:00pm to 7:00pm. Most of the tour packages included Everland in their itinerary so you can imagine the crowd and long lines. T-express was closed because of inclement weather, it was really cold that time. It's nice to go back here when there are less crowd and tourists."
A Disney like theme Park.,"The place is a Disney copy in Seoul. The Park has a panda exhibit, mini zoo, roller coaster and other rides. The same and not changing is The crowd. IT was a thursday but The crowd and lines for The rides were from The shortest OF 30 minutes to 2 hours. A good place to roam around were not for The crowd."
Had so much fun!,We really enjoyed our visit! We liked everything including parking lot. They serve their own shuttle bus from the parking lot. Food and souvenir was expensive.
Totally worth the trip,"We stayed in Seoul and booked a one day trip to Everland. We bought our tickets (including Q pass for some of the animal attractions) beforehand, so had to figure out where to claim Q passes - this has to be done before going in through the turnstiles. Everland is huge - we focused mostly on the animal safaris (you get to sit in a bus that takes you very close to the animals) and the kids locations but it is definitely a place that has something for all ages. "
Thrilling,Everland may be a bit far from seoul but it is still rather easy to get to and very worth it. It is probably the most thrilling theme park in south korea so I definitely recommend it for the adrenaline junkies. Went on a weekday and the queue was ok. 
Theme Park for everyone,I saw fun and some challenging rides for people who like adventure. For us we enjoy the scenery from flower garden till safari area.
Kids heaven,"Likes their twin stroller ..Can rent it here can't recall how much they charge. If you are coming from thousand miles away from this place, do reserve for a full day here, the place is big enough to spend us whole day..."
"T-Express,the ride you must try","i go there on april. the theme park open at 10am, their place so crowded even though we go there early morning. i bought the ticket online. i line up for 1 hours 30min to ride t-express but worth it. t-express just take 3min for ride .  there have restaurant inside the theme park,for muslim you can eat at lotteria restaurant. to go there i take shutter bus from Gangnam Station."
The best way to play,"This place is really big.. And if you want to play all I recommend you to come on weekdays not weekend and start planning your trip before you come (choose which one you want). The T-Express is really recommended for the one who love adrenaline but for the one who has heart disease please don’t take this roller coaster. And for tourist with passport, there are some discount if you bring your passports with you when you buy the ticket."
So much fun!,"Whether you go with kids, friends or as a couple, this is so much fun! Went during Halloween as well as in the spring - so much fun both times. "
Fun family outing,"We had great time visiting Everland. It is a very picturesque park. Everything felt like it was meant for a photo op. We booked through klook, which included park admission and shuttle RT for two adults. Our 9 month old was free. This came out to 104000 won. Everything was very orderly and stroller friendly. The park was clean and they had wonderful baby facilities throughout the park. Would def recommend to families with young kids. We were able to go on many of the rides with baby on lap. We loved Zootopia. Warning though, this park is built on a very hilly terrain, be ready for some steep hikes. They do however have the rope way rides that you can use to help transport you around the park."
Underwhelming experience,"Not impressed. I visited Everland in a Thursday and I was not impressed by the park or it's attractions. For adults, only 2 attractions are thrilling enough: the rollercoaster and the double spin. Signage in the park is very poor so I lost quite some time wandering around. Wait times are significant (at least 1h) and they don't have Single Ride lanes as other parks. It's also very inefficient that the rides don't run full (even in the cable car, which is for 6 people, I was alone since they didn't put other people with me). This is nice if you value personal space but I would rather ride with someone and wait 30 min than ride with an empty seat and wait 60. "
Very crowded on monday,"I booked the bus on klook and went there on a Monday, because i thought that Monday would have less people, however i was sorely mistaken because the lines averaged 40 minutes for the big rides especially t express which took a full hour to board.However the rides are fun and if you happen to go do not miss booking the q pass for free on klook and get as soon as you enter for the t express mainly, the q pass gets sold quickly so be sure to come early."
One of the best fun park in Seoul,"Just 50 minutes away from Myeong-dong district, We booked this tour on Sunday and we departure at 9am and arrive Everland around 9.50am. Overall this park is a place for family who have child and middle age not over 40 yrs. T-Express is awesome we wait around 30mins and enjoy 3 mins on train. Food at park they have all international restaurant like Italian Rest, KFC, Burger and etc. "
Great place to have fun!,Went here in 2014 he he sorry!It was summer in 2014 when I visited here. Not too crowded because it was on a weekdays eventhough school holiday in Seoul if im not mistaken.My and my friend use our passport at the ticket booth to get special price for traveler/foreigner. We tried pretty much all the attractions! And my most favorite one is the wooden roller coaster. It was probably the scariest roller coaster I have ever tried. LOL. The adrenaline rush was like no other because it was sooo high and the woods make it more scarier! Me and my friend rode the roller coaster twice!!
S.Korea’s version of Disney Land,"This theme park was the equivalent to Disney land with some more to offer. Aside from the rides, it boast a safari and a zoo (Pandas, Polar Bears, etc...) Regular scheduled shows are being held. It also has beautiful gardens. cost of food inside is quite expensive. The place is huge. Dont forget to grab a map on the gate to navigate your way to the places you want to go. Make sure to wear comfy footwear. will definitely come back again to this place because 1 day was not enough."
Magical :),From rides to zoos this place has it all for you to spend the whole day! Yes the whole day! So many things are in here :) and the place looks magical :)
One day is not enough! ,"Went on a Tuesday and the crowd is manageable. Each ride queue ranges from 10 to 30 mins. Brought 2 young children age 6 and 4 and they have great fun. We went to Zootopia, went to Lost Valley and was a bus ride to see giraffes, rhinoceros, zebras and many more up close. Then went to Safari World to see lions, tigers, bears up close too. It was a really nice experience. Do not skip Magic land when you have young children, this is a must go with tons of rides that your kids will enjoy. Take note some of rides have height restriction but mainly allowed so long adult accompanied. Thunder falls is a must!! My young kids begged for it and played twice!! If you worried of getting wet, you can put on raincoat which we did. Some of the rides were closed but it does not disappoint us. One day is definitely not enough, the park is simply so huge which we will definitely need to pay a visit again.Tips: come shuttle bus tickets from KLOOK or Trazy, they pick up and drop off at popular places like Myeongdong, Dongdaemun, Hongdae. "
Great and Fun place,"This a great and fun place to visit.The variety of attractions are amazing. Theme park rides, theme park attractions, flower gardens, animal shelters...Getting there on your own is easy. You can choose to take the train. There is a line located at the bottom of the train map. You got to figure out the transfers to get there.Alternatively, there are:Bus 5002 from Gangnam Station Exit 10, 300m away.Bus 5700 from Jamsil Station Exit 6, bus stop in the middle of road.At Everland Station for both train and bus, you can proceed to the Everland Shuttle Bus station located just beside the Bus Terminal."
Beautiful place for fun!,"A group of friends and I went to Everland last summer and had an amazing time! It happened to be a special occasion and they had the very best fireworks/lights show that we had ever seen! The park is clean and well kept with flowers etc, very beautiful. The food is good, the staff is friendly, the rides are fun! The wooden one is a true thrill :-O"
Tulips at Everland,"I went to Everland in late march 2018 and even after many months now, i still have fresh memory of the place. Such a beautiful place to unwind. We spent from morning till atter 8pm and enjoyed the place. I particularly like the tulips garden which has just open in march. Also lots of beautiful daffodils. It is such an amazing sight. Those who like roller coaster ride, you would definitely be thrilled by the numerous ride. There is even a prayer room for muslim which is sizeable and convenient."
Good day out and workout,The park is hugeee with a lot of hills to manouver. We went on 1st May which is a holiday for private sectors but we can also see a lot of school children/ teenagers in uniform. Our experience was quite tiring due to massive queue on almost every ride. I.e. 1 hour queue foe 3 minutes ride. 
Summer,"Its a very nice place to visit. Trains are easy to follow to get there just make sure to leave early and allot a whole day for it. During our trip, lines were not that long. :)"
Our Winter Family Holiday 2012,"It was December 2012 & it was our first trip to Seoul with our 1 yr old girl via Singapore Airline which took 7 hrs flight.Since winter was so cold with 1 yr old child we just entered the up entrance without visited the animal area.There was a baby services which easy for us to change diaper,have warm water and to rest."
Everland South Korea,"A great theme park to spend the day, lovely shows, rides, and beautiful flowers...Love the zoo section where you get really close encounter with the animals.."
Fun filled park worth a visit,What a great place to spend the day. From rides to shows to gardens and animals (start at Panda World) The staff were great and very helpful to foreign visitors who dont speak Korean (thank you!!) Food was good and the Night time parade is worth staying for. Lines were fast for all the rides most I waited was 30min for the popular roller coaster. Really loved my day here
"Forget Lotte World, Everland is the place to be!","Everyone who visits Seoul usually goes to the Lotte World Theme Park because of it’s location and accessibility but trust me, Everland is so so much better.Consisting of 5 huge zones, Everland hits all the marks in terms of a theme park from insta-worthy beautiful landscapes to exhilarating rollercoasters and rides and even their own zoo and safari to boast!! I have never seen that much excitement parked into one place!! Best to start the day early in the morning from the Zootopia side (because the zoo section closes earlier while some rides area open till 10pm) and make your way through the park. Fun and excitement for the whole family of all ages. Definitely a must-visit! "
Recomended,"Everland is great!! I have some fun time with my gf and family.. Luckily it was drizzling a little and soon the rain stopped. The rides was fun and scary, lots of things to do, lots of cafe to chill and relax, lots of shops to see and the safari world is just awesome, Animals roaming around the area while we sit on the bus, what I love most is the bears which can do tricks. However sadly some rides are closed. Overall is nice.."
Giant Pandas,Came to specifically see the 2 giant pandas and it was definitely worth the trip from inner Seoul to see them. The pandas are in an air conditioned enclosure and you can easily spend quite a bit of time just watching them lounge about and learn about their habits. Skipping the line is available but wasn't actually needed since we arrived when the park opened. 
Everland which is wonderful,"Dear TripAdvisor readers and Everland Staff,I would like to give high appreciation to Everland staff for able to find my kid's samsung mobile phone in the theme park.My kid lost his phone during enjoying playing one of the theme, he forgot where last time has his phone in which theme.Then I report to lost and found.At first, it is hard to communicate in Korean language, luckily there is a staff Mr. HONG fat guy who is nice, helpful even with limited english vocab. He understood what I said.He asked my hotel and phone number and did immediate action inform all staffs there to search for the samsung mobile phone.During our way back to Hotel, the everland staff called to infom me the the samsung mobile phone has found and helped me to send to Nine Tree Premiere Hotel Myeongdong II where I stayed.Finally, on our arrival at hotel at night time around 10pm I can get back the mobile phone in same good condition when my kid lost his phone.Thank you Mr. HONG, all staffs at Everland, courier, and Nine Tre Premiere Hotel Myeong Dong II Hotel receptionist Miss EMILY for all excellent effort you disd for us.It is nice to find out that Seoul, South Korea is safe country with polite and helpful people with gratitude.Thank you very much for this unforgetable experience to be rememberred.That EVERLAND WHICH IS WONDERFUL.NICE AND WARM WELCOME ALSO POLITE KOREAN IN SERVICING TOURIST FROM OVERSEAS ESPECIALLY TO ME and My Family.Sincerely yours,Kamin Kasim"
A Beautiful Amusement Park with a Great Safari,"This amusement park is best for young children and tweens. There are some adult rides but very few. Most of the attractions are geared towards young children.There are two great Safari rides which are worth experiencing and a small zoo.There are two main roller coasters and some indoor rides. A few adult rides- but some were closed when I was there this July.There is a fabulous live show, and a parade followed by an awesome fireworks display, but most of it is in Korean and if you don’t understand Korean you can’t follow it.What’s missing from the park are more cool-down solutions. There are very few water rides, not enough drink vendors and during the 2018 Heat Wave, I was there- desperate to find places to sit and relax. A water park or more water rides would be nice."
The best amusement park in Korea,As you can see this park is owned by Samsung tycoon. So the maintenance is very good and well served. Must see if you have a kid. 
Fun day out!,"This is Korea’s version of Disney. Plenty of rides, activities, shows and fireworks to keep the family busy. Even though we were there in the summer, it was not too hot (cooler than Seoul) and lines were not too long. The parade in the evening is spectacular and you must stay for the fireworks at 9.30pm. The wooden rollercoaster is the highlight for thrill seekers...but I chickened out. Kids have bumper cars, playroom, 4D show, ghost shooting, animal safaris, nerf water gun zone - which was perfect for summer."
Best in South Korea,Must visit place in South Korea. I highly recommend this place . Great for family with children. 
MUST Visit,very beautiful theme park with a huge number of different rides for children and adults. recommended to buy fast-lane to skip some long lines. best time to go is early morning once its open to be able to visit the whole park. its far from the city center around 2 hours driving max.
Awesome amusement park,"We were a group of adult friends with one teen and went there on May 30, 2018. Instead of taking the train there we booked with a tour -- KLOOK. The bus picked us up from Myeongdong Station and returned quite late after 10:00 PM because we opted to stay in Everland from the opening time of 10:00 AM to the closing time of 10:00 PM to see the laser/fireworks show. The place did not not disappoint us. We had already been to USJ and the American big amusement parks, e.g. Disneyland, Magic Mountain, Disneyworld, Universal Studios (L.A.). So, this park has big thrilling rides plus small one for the kids. Plus Everland has rides into a zoo enclosure also. Coming from the experience of the cost of USJ and the American parks, Everland is considerably cheaper -- even the food and drinks. Everland is totally worth it for kids and adults of all ages. Beware that there is a lot of walking in stairs and steep slopes so Everland might be a challenge for people with wheelchairs. Also, the lines were very long for the big roller coasters so it might be good to buy a fast pass. We were there the whole day so we ended up doing a lot of the smaller rides and only one of the big rides. There was no prohibition on bringing food so some of us brought water bottles and snacks in our backpacks."
Good family time theme park,"Everland doesn't have the Disney characters throughout the park, but it delivers an excellent day with roller coasters (for adults and for kids), log run, Viking ship, and plenty to do. As a dad, I hosted a small group of preteens, and they enjoyed the day very much. Night time parade was a highlight. "
Fun Fun FUN,"The park is an hour away from Seoul , it is cheaper to buy a combo tickets for the Caribbean bay and Everland . Great rides and the roller coaster is a must ride .My kids had a great fun filled day ."
Many of the attractions were closed,"One week before Korean summerholidaysMany attractions(I would estimate half of them) were closed...but the entrance price was the sameFood is a catastrophe: Fat and sugar nothing else, countless amount of snack booth...all with the same three fat snd sugar snacksIf you have children up to 10 years old, if you bring your own food and if yourself never intended to use the roller coaster then you might consider to spend half a day there...and don‘t forget your ear plugs otherwise the constantly too loud background „sounds“ drive you nuts"
"If you are a thrill seeker, this is not for you ","We came in July on a Friday and it was not really packed. We read online the best time to come is a weekday. There are some thrill rides but it's really not that many and the worst part is that some of the thrill rides were closed.If you want to get a fast pass, please do it before you come to everland. You canmot buy it here. There is this thing called lenny chance which is like a fast pass. Every 30mins gets you one EP. To use it you need to accumulate the EP to ride some rides on the fast queue. You need to download the app called everland Other than that, the park seems theme-less there is no feels like Universal studios or Disneyland. Additionally some VR rides you need to pay for it which is really stupid. When we went, T express the big roller coaster was closed. We only found out when we got here. So it was super disappointing and we really felt a bit cheated. So use the app to check if the rides you wanna sit are open. We went in summer so it's super hot bring lots of water!!! "
It would have been a blast if it wasn't for the weather,"The place looked magical and every theme park crazed adult like myself would have imagine. The rollercoaster rides were the main highlight and the very reason for my visit as tickets are not cheap. However, due to strong winds in the middle of November made it too dangerous for visitors to ride. That dampen my mood. But there were other rides that made it bearable. Therefore take it from me, don't go during early winter when the winds are purportedly strong. The staff were friendly, the food was surprisingly good and the crowds were far less so lines were short. "
the best outdoor theme park in south korea,"I really like everland ... it is quite far from seoul. preferably during the visit is not when winter because the game is mostly outdoor, so you will be very cold especially when the game queue .. the game rides very much there even mini zoo. many souvenir shop in this place so do not worry to buy.everland area is very wide and the decor is very nice especially at christmas. you must visit this place if you go to korea^^"
Awesome,I went there and having so much fun. the must is the T-Expresss . it's like roller coaster but on the wooden rails which is they were claim that the most safety . Well done !!!
Go visit everland,I suggest you to visit Everland when you are in Korea with your lover. It is an amusement park but it has quite big zoo there too. Try T-express which is roller coaster made of woods. You will see your bf or gf screaming out to the air.
"Recommend (zoo) , safari","Theme park is just fine but zoo is very impressive I highly recommend Safari tour , i won't spoil you what you'll see but you'll be very excitedThe animals are also look happy and healthy "
Very Hot in Summer,Playing here all day long was an interesting experience. But it is too hot during summer time. The best time tobe here maybe spring or even autumn.
Funnnn,"Although it was pretty ""far"" from Seoul itself, it was pretty easy to get there as I had booked a tour which had transportation included. The theme park was pretty big and easy to navigate through and the rides were all really fun! There were some rides which had a vcr before the actual ride and to my surprise, there were English subtitles for them which helped out a lot and made everything more fun!"
Nice place with lots of tulips,"Really amazed me with the theme park n zoo.... love the tulips garden. Had fun to see the funny bears during the short trip to the zoo n we had ride the tram. But this Everland quite had not a subtitle in English during the attraction. So we as foreigners really felt clueless and totally did not know what the meaning was. But the bottomline is, we really wanna come back there again bringing our children. Thanks Everland"
Amazing Theme Park in Korea,"This place not in Seoul, We must using Bus from GangNam to go to this place. One of the big outdoor theme park in Korea. Don't forget to try Roller Coaster in Everland because this is the best when came to Everland. But, we came when summer so very very hot in Everland."
Recommend for kids (Zoo),"Couldnt switch the dates for tickets bought DIRECTLY from the Lotte World website despite the rain. Bought express tickets (Q-passes) for 5 attractions only to find out 2 were CLOSED. Majority of attractions closed due to the rain. Couldn't even switch the Qpasses for other attractions. Only salvaging point were the unique experience in the zoo part and the photo spots. Even most of the food stalls are closed due to the rain. Furthermore, extremely inconvenient and difficult to get to Everland. Horrible experience. "
Beautiful Gardens. Largest Theme Park in Korea,"We visited Everland on a Sunday. It is a perfect place for childrens, teens and adults. My advise is to go there early and be prepared for long queues. We missed the zootopia due to limited time and a lot of people that day. The rose garden is so beautiful and amazing and the roller coaster ride (T express) is an unforgettable experience, it so amazing and so fun!! There are cable cars but still be prepared to walk and wear your comfortable shoes. Overall, I really enjoyed our visit and it is worth it. Would love to come back again."
Long queue for most rides,"Everland is South Korea's largest theme park. Located at the Everland Resort in Yongin, a city in Gyeonggi-do. We had 4 hours only in our tour package. The park is true fun with many places to explore and enjoy. The gardens are beautiful especially in the European segment. However, the only drawback was the long queue for most rides. I could not wait for the safari at the ZooTopia. I have read in the brochure that you can book to skip the waiting line by reserving online; this is a good idea for holidaymakers who are visiting for a few hours. You will surely need a full day to enjoy this park with your family. This review is without photos because I was so consumed with enjoying the park, than taking photos. No photos."
Very Family Friendly,"We are family of eight, with the oldest at 68 and youngest at 11-month old. But we all enjoyed the day at Everland. First, I would definitely recommend booking transport to and from Everland since it takes about an hour on the road both ways and you would definitely appreciate not having to worry about how to get back after a tiring day of fun.The park is very big and even though we didn't purchase any fast pass, the queues move very quickly, except the safari ride. But the queue for the safari ride was definitely worth it. It was fun to come so close to the animals. Everyone, including the young kids (4 and 2 years old) could go on all the rides, with adult supervision. So everyone had fun. The park is also very pretty so a great place for those who love taking photos. We stayed for the night show and fireworks. Quite impressive. A good place to bring the whole family."
"Great fun for the kids, beautiful gardens","Travelled with husband and children (aged 20, 9 and 9 months) My children had loads of fun at the rides. I think the biggest thrill for them was the huge wooden coaster that even had my husband wondering about his life decisions ;)The gardens were truly beautiful! Each spot was more instagram worthy than the other. The rose garden was in full bloom at the time of our visit and I can definitely say it is something a lot of gardening enthusiasts would definitely enjoy.The lines for the zoos including the Panda enclosure are not at all bad. Safari was also awesome with the bears coming right up to the bus and standing upright. There's definitely something for everybody.Roads and walkways are well paved though there are some areas which can be a bit steep. Strollers would have no problems. Stroller parking at most attractions available. Would recommend comfortable shoes."
Looks Are Definitely Deceiving,"My honest first impression upon entering the theme park was, ""This is a poor man's Disneyland"", down to the imitation Mickey & Minnie Mouse. Boy was I going to be proven wrong.They have an excellent array of rides that cater to both children and adults. Even the children rides offered a significant thrill. I can't say much (or anything for that matter) about the rides for adults because I didn't take any (yes, I'm chicken like that).The queues were long because it was a holiday in Seoul but the wait times were not that long. What I found really entertaining while queuing was watching the ride attendants dance and sing with the music while their rides were on-going. I'm not sure if this is done for all the rides but do look out for it, they're really good.Stay for the parade and the fireworks display. They are well worth it. But be sure to take note of the time for both and location/route to get good ""seats"".Food selection is pricey (as is the whole of Seoul) and not that great.Also, do your homework about the rides to ensure that the ones you want to ride on are open.If you miss the animal attractions, you are not missing much (not to be confused with the safari rides).Overall, definitely well worth spending a whole day at."
EVERLAND,"Everland is a theme park located in South Korea. I went there this monday and I spend there all day it was really fun. There are lots of attractions like: roller coasters, carousels, gardens, animals and some snacks and restaurants. Mostly I liked “Lost Valley”. It was like safari. The giraffe was getting inside the boat-car. There was also awesome roller coaster called “Thunder fall” and it was water roller coaster. I recomend to go there early in the morning and first go to place called Zootopia were are attractions like: panda world, friendy monkeys, seals and even polar bear! Then you should go on some roller coaster because later there will be queue..."
Very big park,"We came with a group tour (Ktourstory) which we booked on Indiway website so it was about 1hr by bus. It was on a weekday so all rides was about 10-20 mins wait only which was okay. There are many rides on Magic Land for my 4yo which my teens also took. The park is very huge that they have gondola and cable car rides to take us from point to point. We love the Rose garden for pictures. For Muslims, there is no halal meals but you can bring in food in your bag. They didnt check :) Just make sure to clean up after! Their baby room is so so complete and efficient. Clean, comes with microwave and hot/cold water. Brushes for washings and there are many around the park. "
Lots of fun,A huge theme park with many activities for all ages. The rollercoaster on a large wooden structure is a must! It was not too crowdy on a weekday. We were disappointed by food offered. All they offer is fast food.
Fun filled day,"We’re lucky that the park was not crowded. We’re able to take the good rides twice. The park is big so you have to plan your route, otherwise you’ll be walking a lot up and down the hilly tracks. The rides are a little dated but still thrilling.They have a nicely renovated place for Muslim to pray. However, if you have a special diet restrictions, you’ll probably need to pack your food in advance. There are many restaurants and snack stalls, but they sell much of the same."
Beautifully maintained ,"We enjoyed Zootopia the most. This is where you can take the two most interesting rides called Safari World and Lost Valley. If you only have time for one then definitely go for Safari World. Be prepared to queue for at least 30min, we went on a weekday fyi. Worth the queue though. You will see lions and bears really up close. From one “land” to another, there are chairlifts and cable cars as transportation. Still, be prepared to walk and walk a lot. Good thing is there are plenty of seats around and restaurants to rest your feet. Toilets could be harder to find at times. Lots of shops selling Everland merchandise. At the time we visited, at the European Land, there was an extremely beautiful and huge rose garden. Be sure to walk around there. "
Beautiful Park,"We went on a Monday morning, and the weather forecast was rain. So there was actually fewer people on that day, but turned out it did not rain and we had cool and cloudy weather the entire day. The kids managed to take their favourite rides several times (thrice on Thunder Falls and five times on bumper cars), and waited only 15mins for Lost Valley and Amazon Express. We went to Seoul Land on our previous trip, and I would say Seoul Land is equally fun, except it is smaller and the zoo is a separate attraction in Seoul Grand Park. The fireworks at Everland was fantastic, and we stayed till 9.30pm for it. It was worth the wait. We booked out tickets through Klook and the return bus trip was very convenient -- the operator Ktourstory was pretty good in the communications, and the guides could speak english and mandarin. Overall we enjoyed our Everland trip tremendously."
Amazing experience in everland Korea!!!!,"It's a complete happy and satisfying day in Everland, Korea. My family really enjoyed a lot for this wonderful theme park. We really like the view, the rides and the great fantastic place everland can offer!!"
Huge and interesting place to visit ,"I would have to say, if you only have time for one ride, go for the T express. It’s probably the best wooden roller coaster in Asia currently. Queue can be a long wait thou, so it will be helpful to use the app to book a Ticket. Amazing rides that can accommodates small children and kids. Don’t miss the safari world and also the lost world. Amazing sights and they do have many animals in that small area. Safari world has walking and dancing bears which shouldn’t be missed. They have many tigers and lions as well. The lost world has an amazing vehicle which can go on water and land, bringing you to see many animals. Food wise, there are many cafes and variety of food. Don’t miss the fireworks at night too! "
Very nice theme oark,The place was huge and I think will definitely take at least one day to finish. Many different areas with different themes. Personally love the animals zone the most where I got very close to the animals inside a bus! Memorable. And the bears were so cute! Thumbs up!
Day trip to everland ,"Get ready to spend a day there for the amazing rides and landscape. We booked the tickets online on their official website as no other sites offered their Qpass for sale. Qpass is access ticket to their rides without queuing or waiting for admission time at all. Of course it cost quite abit but i think it is worth getting, so you don’t spend hours queuing for popular rides. Do take note of height restrictions if you are getting the Qpass for your kids too. You can download a copy of their map on their website too. In it, it would tell u the height restrictions for their rides on the legends. We went on a Monday, so there is not much crowd. Some rides are not opened until noon, such as sky cruise, ski chair lifts, T express. I bought 3 Qpasses for safari world, lost valley and panda world. Please do not buy qpass for panda world as I personally feel that it is not worth it. If there’s no queue, go ahead and visit the panda exhibits. If there is a long queue, i will recommend you to skip it. It is not a adventure ride, but a showcase of 2 pandas only. I did not buy a qpass for amazon express cos it states for over 110cm but it turns out that my daughter is eligible to ride even though she is not 110cm. Accompanied by guardian is fine apparently. The staff are really wonderful! To make your wait entertaining, they actually perform dances and raps with the music! Nowhere have I experienced such entertainment before while waiting in line. If you like to have an adrenaline rush, pls take the T express! It is the most thrilling ride i have ever had, probably also the longest roller coaster ride! The drop is omost 90degrees, such that I actually lifted off my seat! And the drops are never ending. Must try for the dare devils. Definitely not for the faint hearted! Not suitable for young kids even though they are over 130cm, i think it can be really scary. Oh yes, another ride Thunder falls is also one of the rides that you should go on! Kids over 100cm are eligible if accompanied by guardian. Can be quite scary, saw young kids crying when the ride ended. Pls prep your child for it, the ride is like a water raft coaster ride, drops once reversed, and once forward facing! Bound to get wet, pls wear dryfit or a windbreaker! Same for amazon express, you will get wet riding it, do wear waterproof clothes. Magic land and aesop village is the place for young children! Endless rides such as roller coasters and vikings are suitable for kids over 100cm, accompanied by guardian or 110cm to go alone. My family, especially my 5 yr old enjoyed everland! Tip from my local guide is to go to zootopia first before proceeding to the rest of the areas and i followed her tip. Think reason being the zoo is quite the highlight for the park and people basically flock there to see the animals as well as take the rides. U can easily book shuttle buses online or via klook or kkday. Everland has their everland taxi, but it is really expensive. Shuttle bus is more economical. Take a shuttle bus to everland public bus park and transfer to their everland shuttle juz diagonally across. You would see people flocking there so you definitely won’t get lost. Just follow the masses. The return is the same, take the shuttle from where they dropped you outside everland. Their shuttle runs every 5-10mins. Overall I find everland is a place to spend a wonderful time with your kids or loved ones! The staff at everland are really polite and warm as compared to other theme parks tat i have been to. I think its their korean culture. Really enjoyed my day with my family at Everland! "
A good day out!,"Everland is a fun theme park that is very family orientated with characters and a 'zoo' area. There are only 2 bigger rollercoasters so not one for thrill seekers! We enjoyed wandering around the different areas and going on the 'safari' rides to see the animals up close. I would recommend downloading the everland app (it is in English) to accumulte EP to get fast pass tickets for these safari rides. Food inside is very reasonably priced and there are lots of stands to get cold drinks, coffee and snacks. You are allowed to bring your own food. Toilets are pretty clean.We went on a Sunday and it was actually quite quiet, we queued only an hour for the T-express (the main big rollercoaster). We took the bus from the main street by Gangnam Subway station - it was easy, cheap, and quick (less than an hour). But the bus was very full and some people had to stand up.Overall, I would recommend this as a fun, and not too expensive day out!"
This review comes with a disclaimer,"Ok first things first? i am not a big fan of Theme Parks so take that with a grain of salt. That said? its easy to commute going here, however, this place is way crowded. its also way big, so im sure people will find enough things to do despite having so many people around. i don't speak korean but i would still highly recommend going through the 2 rides that drives you around to see animals. the one with the bear was particularly fun. i may not understand what the guy was saying? but it was still funny nonetheless."
Family oriented theme park,"Family oriented theme park - rides less than brilliant for the most part but a large and generally interesting environment particularly for families with smaller kids especially those looking for photo ops. Not quite on a par with the top theme parks, and lots of stuff in Korean only. Crowded yes, even on a weekday, but lines are tolerable except for the hottest rides. There is a zoo of some sort which is unusual, and there are plenty of interesting animals. Food prices are generally reasonable particularly at the Korean eateries so it is not truly necessary to bring food in (they do not seem to check anyway when I was there). We found the combo ticket for ticket and shuttle a good deal (easy to book using the Trazy website), and all in all a pretty reasonable full day outing at a reasonable price."
Good Fun,"We spent a day here with our young children! There are rides for all age group and their map clearly state the height requirement for the various rides. There is also a mini zoo and a safari concept ride here too. Lots of things to play and see, ranging from animal shows to rides! But the walk around the park can be taxing for the elderly but luckily some parts (uphill) have travelator."
 Book Q pass before you go!,"A big theme park with many attractions. The vast majority being family orientated. There are only 2 proper rollercoasters, however the big wooden one is one of the best I’ve ever been on. It’s worth going just for that. The queue was 2 hours but we paid £14 each extra to jump it which was well worth it. The only ride you could do this for (and we got a video of us on the ride)The queues were long for everything, between 30 mins to an hour. We really wanted a q pass which means you can jump all of them but found out this has to be bought before you go. Also a lot of things either opened up in the afternoon or not at all. No idea why they don’t open everything in the morning. Overall worth a trip if you’ve got a free day. "
All in one park..,"Our tour company scheduled a Sunday to visit the park. Big mistake Too crowded and we had only 6 hours !!Interesting and beautiful theme park. Famous & largest in South Korea. Different to Disney world and Universal studios. It was the tulip season and the whole park was decorated with different colours of tulips.We met real pandas at the panda world. Along the way we saw polar bear, tigers, penguins, sea lions, different kind of birds. 1.5 hours in the queue to enter safari world. Ride is only 15 min. Saw animals such as bears, tigers , lions etc.Missed out lost valley and many rides due to long queues.T express roller coaster look amazing. Sadly not enough time to try.Interesting music garden and Aesop's house. There are restaurants all around the park. So you won't be hungry or thirsty and reasonable charges .Parking is free for visitors. Must visit place in South Korea. Make sure to be there early and to avoid weekends. Since there is lot of walking, recommend to wear comfy shoes"
A MUST GO ATTRACTION IN KOREA,"If you are a theme park kind of guy then Everland is the good for you. Well it is not that extream, they do have the t-express the largest wooden coster and several other extream rides but what you get when visiting this park is its uniqness in term of feel. You'll feel like dreaming in here. Relax. Well dont go on weekend though. This park lanscape change according to season and the best view can be capture during april (Tulips) and May (Roses), the park just ever so beautiful these time of year. Everland is so big, if you decide to play almost everything like i did. It took me 2 visits @ 2 days to finish the whole park. From opening to closing.In the evening, the parade and firework is a must see attraction in the park. Starts at 6pm. Getting there is easy, you can take shuttle bus, normal bus, or easiest by subway stop at everland station. For muslim, there are several food that you can eat. The burger shop, madagascar restaurant... They do sell all these fish cakes in the stall all over the park. There is also a mussola marked as Surau in the center of the park. Basically its muslim friendly park. If you are traveling with your kids (small to teen), everland is something you should never miss. "
Superb!,"Superb, better than Disneyland Paris for the money, highly recomnended. Book with transportation, as it is a long way from Seoul by public transport."
T express is amazing! ,"It’s no Disney land but it was fairly decent. They don’t have a great deal of ‘big rides’ but honestly the T express is one of the best rollercoasters I have ever been on, it was mental!! A lot of things were closed when we went which was annoying. Really wasn’t impressed with them having a polar bear there either, it looked really miserable! The moonlight magic parade was lovely. It’s definitely not an amazing theme park but it was a fun day out. "
Do a little research prior: Entertaining Amusement Park,"Spring time visit. A lot larger than Lotte World in Seoul. Everland was built in the mountainous forest basin of Yongin and larger than other parks found in Asia. The park is style and system is similar to other amusement parks in the US. There are a variety of roller coasters and kid-friendly rides. Plenty of parking, with a shuttle bus taking visitors to and from the park entrance.Food, snacks, drinks, and merchandise costs are not outrageous like Disney Parks. I had trouble using my US based credit cards, so I had to use American Express or Korean won. Most popular rides on the Saturday I went were roughly 1 hour waits. Worth the trip!"
Great rides,"What Everland lacks in recognizeable intellectual property, they make it up with the variety of attractions - from extreme rides like the T-Express (a wooden rollercoaster), the diabolical Rock Spin to more sedate ones like the Safari Express (featuring real animals) to unexpectedly hilarious ones like the Rotating House. The park is very big - we went there on a Sunday, the parking lot was packed and overflowing but inside, we did not feel crowded. The lines were faster than Tokyo DisneySea or Universal Studios Japan. A worthwhile day trip outside Seoul."
Well-Worth our pay. ,"My family went there (145cm, 130cm, and a 2yr old.) One of the best thrill roller-coaster ride I ever had - T-Express, travelling 200kph, 77 degree drop. Line was about an hour for this ride. Minimum height required is 130cm. You should do this first when you go in. I specified the height because of the height requirements for the thrill rides. Other thrill rides we enjoyed are Thunderfalls (you'll get wet), rolling x-train, Columbus Adventure. Other spinning thrill rides we didn't do like hurricane, let's twist, double rock spin. Other things to enjoy are safari world bus ride (tigers and lions, giraffe are a close encounter, the bears even do walking tricks.), Lost Valley amphebious vehicle ride, panda, which we missed because it was already closed late afternoon. Cable car ride and sky way are awesome experiences. Kids enjoyed the going around the Magic Cookie House obstacle course.What we didn't like about this park is the schedule of the ride opening... Several rides opens at 1pm and other section closes early like 4pm, specially the other dining carts. Some lines took 30mins while others took 60mins. But it's relatively short when i compare it to 90 to 120mins of waiting time.Overall, we're very happy with our visit."
Korean Disneyland ,"This park is literally the dream of every kid and adult that wants to have fun any sunny day. The attractions are amazing and around certain events during the year, special events and decorations are displayed: we went a month or so before Halloween and there was even a zombie parade. Looking forward to go again! "
Attractive animals,"Combo zoo and amusement park, must spend whole day here. You can watch giant panda relaxing while having bamboo stick for a snack, slam dunk-ing bear, amd others. The animals look happy and healthy. At the amusement park, you can ride the longest roller coaster track in south east asia. For muslim visitor, you can find praying room / surau near cable car station+4d cinema. "
Worth-it 👍,I love this place. I love their rides. The theme park is really big. One day isn’t enough to tour this place since they have a long queue for their rides. They have a lot of “Instagramable” areas in the park. I love their shows at night; the fireworks and LED show. I’ll definitely comeback here when I’ll visit to Korea again. 
Had a great time in Everland despite bad weather ,"Overall, we had a great time at Everland.. Reached the entrance around noon, sadly it was a rainy day, some rides/attractions were closed..We took these rides in following sequence: -1. European Adventure (Rotating House)2. American Adventure (Robot VR) - Paid facility (5,000 won per pax)3. All available rides/attractions in Zootopia (Safari World, Amazon Express, Lost Valley)4. European Adventure (T-Express)Tips that may be helpful for you: (1) Be sure to check the weather report to decide which day to go to, because some rides will be closed due to bad weather..(2) Check the operation time for your desired rides/attractions & work your way around it - Zootopia will be closed at 6pm while some rides like T-Express still operates after 6pm.. "
Just ok,"It's a bad timing when we came, the weather is so hot the suddenly it rains. It's huge outdoor park and not much food here. To be honest, we enjoyed Lotte world more than here, just my opinion"
Amazing themepark for young kids!,Love the spring weather to play in Everland. Try to avoid weekend as the queue is pretty long. Not much can play in a day. Must visit the safari zoo.
Wasted days,"A really poor theme park compared to others I've visited such as Alton Towers (UK).The lines were crazy, not just the big rides like T-Express but pretty much everything had a wait of well over an hour. And when you finally got on a ride, they really were not that impressive.Our whole group felt it was a wasted day off that could have been spent doing something much better."
Only impressive attraction was the safari,"Getting to Everland by bus was relatively easy. There were lots of existing instructions provided on where to get on the bus, but no one mentioned there were MANY bus stops at the place mentioned! The 5002 bus stop is located on an island of a very wide 2-way main road. We walked about 200 meters before deciding it’s too far from where we should be, so headed back and I noticed that there were many buses stopping for passengers in the middle of the road where there’s an island with a few bus stops. Fortunately we got on the next bus after wondering the streets a bit. Once you get off at Everland (it’ll be on the small monitor at the front of the bus, and almost the entire bus was emptied), there’re signs providing the directions to the free shuttle to the park. A 7-11 and washroom is also available should you need one. Unfortunately, once in it was sort of downhill from there. Many attractions were closed for some reasons...isn’t the price the same for Low and high season? So wouldn’all t the attractions be opened? Granted there maybe a small handful closed for maintenance or unscheduled works but you can see an entire cluster is closed...The only saving grace, and worth the queue is the safari. You get really up close with the animals albeit not many different species. I do recommend you to sit on the left side of the bus (behind the driver) as he will feed the brown bears for tricks and the bears have to come really close to get the treatsFood wise, we were surprised that they are very reasonably priced. You can get a decent meal under USD20. We did not stay for the fireworks so left the same way we cameDo note that 5002 can be very crowded so may have to stand all the way, however the ride is no more than 30-40 mins"
Always Have Your Phone Ready for Lenny’s Chance,"Visited the park on a relatively crowded Friday and still had a blast. The park doesn’t offer much offerings for thrill-junkie like me but T Express in itself is worth the trip alone. Biggest takeaway, however, is to have your phone always be ready to reserve ride times for those with long lines on your phone. Each 30 minutes of your visit grants you one point for you to do so. The earlier you come, the more points you get."
Amusement park with a Zoo,"I enjoyed the lost valley and the safari rides, the zootopia is a must visit! A great place for family with kids and kids at heart. I also enjoyed the fantasy, magical parade. There was a tulip festival during my visit which is lovely! A must visit if you enjoyed themed-park or zoo(s)! "
Ok theme psrk,"Everland was somewhat fun for my younger daughter. She’s almost 6 but not yet 110 cm tall so she wasn’t allowed on a lot of rides.We enjoyed the zoo and some kiddie rides such as the mini rollercoaster for toddlers, tea pot, sand play area, and pony ride. We also like the gondola ride even though it’s very short. The food at the park was mediocre. There’s a mini mart right before you enter the park. You can purchase snacks and drinks there. There’s also an outdoor discount gift store before you enter the park. Cute headbands were about 5000 won. In the park gift shops the headbands are 8000-10000 won. The outdoor gift shop was not open in the morning when we arrived at the park so we bought stuff in the gift shops in Everland. We were in Everland about 12 years ago and some of the rides have not changed. We went on a Monday and many attractions were not open. I’m not sure why.We had a good time but this is a very small amusement park compared to Disneyland. "
"A hoot and a half, but don't plan a trip to Korea around it","This is the largest amusement park in Korea. There are a variety of rides for everyone to enjoy but if you're a thrill seeker there may not be as many as you'd hoped. T-Express is still the most exciting rollercoaster in the park.As fun and nice as it is, this amusement park is more for people living in Korea. Don't plan a trip around it. It is no Disney or Universal."
Easily became my sons' favorite theme park,"My family visited Everland during winter of 2016. It was the delight of our lives. The place is tourist friendly and the attractions are well-kept, thought-of, and executed. Among the attractions we really liked are: - the T-Express - Claimed to be the steepest ride in the world, only one of my sons had the courage to take this ride on a cold winter night. He said he at the very top when you are falling fast, you don't know if you are shouting out of fear or because of the pain of the cold wind. :P- Safari World - This wild Safari is truly enjoyable, seeing the animals at very close distance.- Lost Safari - Same as the wild Safari but with the added enjoyment of riding an amphibian vehicleThere's so many other nice attractions offered and a lot of new ones too. We plan to go back and visit this place again."
Good theme park,"I purchased our ticket thru Klook. Cheaper than buying on site. Just scan the QR codes at the gate and you’re good to go. I didn’t purchase the ticket for shuttle bus cause I thought the theme park is very near from subway and bus station. I was wrong, for those with children I suggest you book a private shuttle bus going there from Seoul, it saves you a hassle, it’s a bit expensive but it’s all worth it specially if you want to spend until night. That’s a bit of my regret when going there, we used to DIY for all of our tours, because I want to know the options on how to: just Incase there is no available taxis or worst we’ve been left by a bus. Anyway for those who still wants DIY, you can ride a subway directly to joendae/Yongin station it’s pretty easy to navigate, just download seoul subway, but this has lots of transfer. Quite challenging but you’ll like it because you will learn how to use subway and it saves you a lot. Subway is running form 5:30am - 12am. But It’s 1.7KM crosswalk from Yongin station to main entrance of theme park. 1.5KM crosswalk from bus station. You can easily see spot the road direction crossing the roundabouts. there’s a big sign also on the main road where the park is located. You just need to enter the premises but the main entrance is far that’s why you need to walk kilometers long. (That’s explain) we went there during tulips festival, the park is surrounded of tulips everywhere, there’s a big tree on the entrance that’s decorated of different kinds of flowers and colors. So adorable. There is Zootopia for kids and thrilling rides for teenagers and adults. The park is big enough to tour for one day. Lots of restaurants here and there. it’s in suburb area, bring a coat because it’s cold there. We tried the T-express and it’s freakin insane! It’s like your soul left you but worth the thrill! I’ll come back again in autumn. We’re glad we came. "
Not as good as people say,"You have to queue for almost everything (20-80mins) and there’s nothing special. And not all of the attractions are free, you have to pay for some of them! One thing I found very cruel is in the zoo park, the animals are not treated well, the space for them is way too small. Don’t go to Everland, save the money for Disneyland! "
Korea's Disney,"If you want to visit Everland, definitely allocate ample time of at least half a day to explore the many sections and attractions it has to offer. Queue times can be slightly long, especially on the T-Express, but it's a thriller you wouldn't want to miss if you dig rollercoasters. The tulips are also a big draw for people, while in spring there are plenty cherry blossoms blooming in and around Everland."
JFK JROTC Visit ,"Our Everland experience was not dampened by the cold and rain. In fact, there were many people braving the 46 degrees Fahrenheit and rain. Customer service was excellent. The park rides and features catered to all ages! Although I didn’t ride anything, I was amazed with the beautiful flowers and plants that aligned the park. There were shops and restaurants that kept me busy! The variety of eating establishments kept everyone happy! Despite the cold, our cadets rode ALL rides! They made the most of their day at the park! "
Super worth to visit the Safari,"It’s a nice theme park to visit - different than disneyland or universal studio. It has a super big safari which is worth to visit! Love it so much. I felt that the entrance fee is super worth it. If you can only have 1 day to visit a theme park, between Lotte World and Everland, this is definitely a much better choice! (: during Christmas, the place is well-decorated! The parade is awesome too just that the place was almost dead during winter (it was too cold! -14 to walk around outside haha)"
everland- the most popular theme park in asia.,"everland provides unique theme park experience + safari + flower festival. --> fun packed for all ages - thrilling rides for teens and adults. animal performance/safari for all ages and families. the FAMOUS parade of professional acrobats and dancers from all over the world. Flower festival. tulip festival. light show. and moreonly problem is how to get there. technically can get there by train but takes 3 hr each way from seoul.and the ticket is a bit pricey( although compared to disneyland, it is much cheaper. but i got a discount ticket."
Relive your childhood,It was bitterly cold and snowing that day but it was still so much fun. There were practically no lines for anything. The park has many themed zones and well landscaped gardens making for great pictures. It even had a safari themed ride that you could see many animals up close. You can easily spend the entire day here and not feel bored. Tulips were beautiful when we were there in late march.
So much fun!,"It will take you more than a day to fully enjoy all the attractions here. A first-timer, I didn't bother getting a two-day pass and instantly regretted it. My SO and I loved Panda World and the Safari tour. We were able to catch the ""seasonal"" attraction they had, a haunted house powered by VR as I recall, since we went there after Halloween."
Everland Adventure,"Our family enjoyed our visit to Everland, especially our picture taking with a lot of different colors of tulips..we watched animal show..had some rides.due to limited time to saty there we were not able to explore more..but there are some establishments that are close..i think you should spend the whole day when visiting the Everland to be able to explore the whole place and enjoy the rides."
Its a must to visit,Everybody can enjoy here. They have great rides and safari. We went here in mid-month of March so we able to catch the Tulip festival. This place is pretty big so you need spend here for 1 day. Too bad when we went here was raining so roller coaster was not available. The staff here is approachable even they don't speak much in English. Transportation is very easy as well no worries to get lost.
Good for all ages :D,"I love this place. This place fits everyone from my 6 year old niece to 68 years old gran. Okay maybe not my gran... it's pretty big and you have to walk around a lot. Still they have wide variety of rides for all ages and they will make you happy! Use express line system thingy for T-express, it's usually very crowded but worth it. This ride's pretty long! They also have really nice zoo... and pretty much everything else. Food inside is a bit expensive, including snacks. Bring a water bottle!Also they have TONS of discount options, check their websites or better, your Korean friend :D"
Great experience in everland,"If you want to find a different feel of roller coaster, you should try T-Express..an old wood roller coaster with great and different experience of roller coaster that i ever try before. take almost 1 hour from Seoul by shuttle bus from Gangnam Station. Really enjoy here.. "
"Many rides closed on Monday, 12 March 2018","Pros:- No queues whatsoever. - Animals were simply lovely! The safari ride was exciting, and it was a novel experience seeing them up close. - VR rides were awesome! Even the 2 paid ones were so worth it. :D- Staff are very entertaining. Those manning the rides will start dancing and rapping. Cons:- Many shops and rides are closed. (I think ~35% closure would be a fair estimate) - Quite a lot of animals weren’t available for viewing, as it’s too cold for them. - If you can’t understand korean, then be prepared to smile and nod and pretend you do! :P Many staff don’t know English, so you’ll have to do some guesswork. Staff are generally very friendly though! "
Go to Zoo,straight ahead to the zoo adventure and take Burger store for lunch. The zoo adventure is the best on the everland. Promise 
Spend almost the whole day here ,"Came here part of the tour itinerary, came here by bus .Theme park was filled with people, have fun here . Good for family , couples and friends . "
Enjoyed,Want to visit again. Many things left to do. Many visitors during the time of visit. Easy to get there.
"Good theme park, but a lot of attractions are close","I going to park in winter, not good for me.A lot of attractions are close, I am not sure why. Food stall and snacks are everywhere, but most of them are closed."
Beautiful and awful,"Flower in garden so beautiful, a lot of the flower, food and variety of global architectural styles from all ages and localities."
Fun for all ages,"Theme park loaded with all age fun from adventure, carnival, zoo and food. Friendly staffs, good transport and free parking. Some attractions are closed due to maintenance and seasonal shutdown which is disappointing. Try be there early as possible to enjoy all and expect long wait for popular rides."
theme park for your all family member,"you can find everything you are looking for in theme park. High speed roller coaster, beautiful garden, merchandise shop, even zoo. it's huge park. however, you dont need to worry, as they provide cable car and escalator. snacks are everywhere, but most of them are closed. it was low period i guess, so i can play more than 7 activity."
One Unforgettable Day at Everland,"A lot advised against going to Everland during winter, and still, we decided to book Klook vouchers that included roundtrip transpo, along with the admission tickets. We wanted the convenience of getting there without the train transfers/walking, and have the option to stay until the very last hour without worrying about the commute back. That decision turned out to be one of the best ones we made during our trip as we ended up having a very memorable day at Everland. Despite the -13-deg temp (and the blowing winds that came with it), we really had fun, and was able to go around the entire place, and enjoy the rides that we wanted to try. We, especially, love our time spent sledding solo and together. We both went back more than once on the solo sled rides, and would have come back for another round on the family course (for sledding) if it weren’t for the long line and an even longer wait time (out in the cold). We survived - and thoroughly enjoyed - Everland during winter. I highly recommend including it in your itinerary."
Unforgettable!,"It was one of the most unforgettable experiences I had when I visited SK! It's the one-stop shop for all your entertainment needs. Aside from the rides, there's a zoo, gardens and other types of amusement and entertainment. THE T-EXPRESS IS A MUST TRY!"
Wonderful experience but a lot of attractions are closed,"Visited early December, with temperature of about -4, the lights were spectacular and we took a lot of nice photos. Not much attractions are open, even food stalls but we enjoyed nonetheless, especially with the Safari experience. Should probably try visiting during Spring or summer to make the most of the experience. "
Great time spend here! ,"Great theme park! Great fireworks and great show!I think they need to add more information in their maps, like time the attraction open and close, the show time, which one for baby or children or teenanger, so tourist like us not feel disappointed, because so many attraction that we like to play but showed or closed already!!!Thank you! "
It’s absolutely not your winter wonderland,"It’s my second time here but unfortunately i visited this park back in Dec few years ago and this year I visited in January, both in winter. Since it’s the coldest month of the year, i concluded that this is worse than my previous visit last time. Once again i said that this is not the best park in the winter. All the attractions in zootopia area are closed except the Panda, food stall and food hall are all closed. Almost all attractions in european adventure are closed especially the famous T Express which make me disappointed once more. But i understand maybe it’s outdoor, maybe it’s too cold, maybe it’s too foggy or dusty but I don’t get it why the mystery mansion, Robot VR or any other indoor attractions are also closed. Most the food area are closed and it made us hard to find just a proper place to have meal. Once we found the food hall there’re only less than 10 people in hundreds of empty chairs and tables. The Holland Village, the garden, all are closed. So we managed just to play the rolling x train and any other kid’s attraction (Fyi: I am a thrill seeker). As I remember the attraction that open is no more than 10 attractions. There’s no parade or closing event or any beautiful thing you imagined theme park gave to you, they also closed early in 7pm. The plus thing the everland have is the kids get to play snow sled but prepare your own clothing if you bring kids. And the other plus thing is no queue and the park is very quiet in Winter, no long line no crowded area and you can enjoy taking pictures with no one disturb you.So my conslusion as 2-times-visitor in the winter: do not waste your time, 2 hours from seoul to get here and another 2 hours to go back to seoul just to see this dissapointing park in the winter. Visit another time of the year."
Had a GREAT time,"Easy way to find shuttle bus.My family enjoyed our Everland Full Day trip.Luckily, I was able to download a 35% discount coupon from Baynaru.We had a great experienced, very smooth travel from seoul to everland.Specially T-express was really thrilling and fun in Everland!"
It was fun,I really liked it. Overall experience was fun. Rides are pretty extreme. Extremely cold during the winter season. My favorite part was the safari/zoo. We managed to get a good seat to see performances of animals. Enjoyed it. Will revisit.
A must for Theme park and thrill ride lover,"Some of the animals were closed during the cold season, but the rest of the rides still active. I can't say much, because Everland is really a must go theme park if you have the time, especially during Nov, probably because crowd is not as much, so less queue for more fun. Favourite ride got to be T- Express, but is really high so got for the weak heart i guess."
Everland plus bus ride,"We were able to book a discounted ticket and bus to and from Myeongdong and Everland. We bought it Funtastickorea.com website. It was very easy and convenient taking the bus than taking the subway. We enjoyed the cable rides at Everland and seeing the animals like bears, panda, lion and so many more. We stayed until the closing for the fireworks show. The whole place was great since it was autumn when we were there. Did I say we had it at a discounted price? Try it and Enjoy!"
Good Enough ,"Just wanna try what South Korea’s themed park has to offer. It was okay. We didn’t try any of the rides though. We just walked and explored the different parts of the park for a good 4-5 hours. We hired a taxi (from Myeongdong) to take us there and waited for us. Good thing we agreed because after the small parade, we felt like we wanted to just go back and rest at our hotel. "
I love it i had to go there everytime i visit Seoul!,"I like it when i first came during spring in year 2014 - however, the queue is quite long back then. But this time, it was during winter (5th Dec) and i love it! - Less Q and less people - LOL. Im not a roller coaster person so i was okay with some of their roller coasters closed due to temperature drop. Hehehe.. But my friend made me ride this round thingy that swings like hell! eventho my knees are weak, its quite an interesting experience tho - it felt like i left out all my organs in the air as it swings~ The weather was excellent at that time (sunny with -4 degrees of coldness) and turns out we had tons of excellent pictures!"
Beyond Expectation,"Went during spring and there are lots of flower on display, each are picture perfect! Our experience is totally fun! Rides are extreme, the zoo (yes, there's one inside!) is amazing with enclosed ride"
Something for everyone ,"This themepark has something for all ages -- 3 to 74 y.o. -- to make a wonderful memory. Everland is parts Disneyland, Ocean Park/Gardens By the Bay and Legoland. Lots of souvenir stores with rides ranging from sit down cable car to 360-degree Double Rock Spin. Entertainment also spans from close encounter with animals (butterfly to penguin to tiger) to VR.Its size needs a full day to experience the best of the best, even if queue time was less than 5 minutes when we visited on Christmas day. We skipped the safari and sea lion show and stayed longer than expected at the Panda World (must meet Lesser Panda) and butterfly area (flower hats and on branches allow butterflies to land on your hand/body).Need to lower expectations on parade quality and food options, but over all, it's hard to resist not to take many, many pictures to capture the great place."
Lovely But Can Be Improved,"Everland is pretty huge. We visited on the first week of December, and while there were some tour buses in sight, the place remained pretty spacious. On the upside, it made for short wait in almost all rides. The downside is that a handful of rides didn't open until later that day. We didn't get to try many of the rides due to the almost-2-hrs wait at T-Express, but it was worth it. The ride lasted longer than most roller coasters, and the numerous waves on the trail at 104 kph made it exhilarating. The pandas are adorable, but I felt bad for the golden monkey family left in the open and huddled tightly due to the cold. While the Safari World was fun and the driver was entertaining, I wish they didn't train the black and grizzly bears. Some things to keep in mind when planning your Everland trip:-Attractions have different closing times, and they're not specified on the map. -Check with Information or the official website for the parade times.-If you miss your scheduled bus or want to commute using the train, travel will take approximately 2hrs (if you're staying around Hongdae or nearby areas). You can search for Seoul MRT to check for routes.-If you do take the train, avoid Line 2 if you have a baby/stroller/senior. This express line is jam-packed and hellish. At least that was our experience the morning we took it to Everland. -Global ATMs are available near the entrance. Better get your moolah there before exploring the theme park."
South Korea's largest theme park,"We visited during Halloween in October and traveled here via train from Myeongdong. Train travel takes approx. 1hr and requires a transfer to the Everland bus (free and quite regular) from the station to the park entrance. The bus driver will announce which bus stop he will depart back to the train station when alighting so keep in mind if traveling back to the train station via Everland bus. We bought our tickets from Klook at a great price and we had to pick up our tickets from a kiosk. Arriving around 10:30am, there was already a huge line at the turnstiles. As a standard for all major theme parks, we anticipated big queues for all popular rides so we came with a hit list of the rides we wanted to ride to prevent time wasting. As it is a big park, it is also worth noting that the park is on a hilly terrain, meaning there will be a time when there's going to be uphill/downhill walking. With so many rides, we were able to hit 60-70% of the rides without getting the ""fast-passes"" (as most fast-passes were finished or had too long a queue). The staff were friendly and spoke English. Dialogues or commentaries in rides were in s.korean but the plot/intention were easily understood. Popular rides had queue times averaging from 0.5-2hr; we visited on a Tuesday.Restaurants were plentiful, each with set menus (international flavors and prices) displayed outside. There were also snack stalls all around the park from churros, turkey's legs, ice cream to drinks. Everland also had their own parade that runs through the main section of the park. Parade times were available on the park guide map. Although overall not as good as international theme parks like Universal Studios or Disneyland, it does deliver it most aspects from adult-kid rides, better than average quality and variety of rides, overall atmosphere and park entrance price."
"Everland Resort, the Disneyland of South Korea!","We went there on 1 December 2017, bought the tickets online through Klook & got a great offer. The place was superb. There was not much of queuing involved since it's Friday & coming to Winter season. We had lots of fun there....we almost have the place to ourselves. Went there on our own by train & shuttle bus, very easy to go there. Take note of the 1 hour journey to the place though. Be prepared to get there as early as possible to avoid traffics & crowds. Love this place so much....spent there the whole day. Get reading with a comfortable walking shoes..."
Very Nice Place to Be very friendly Staff,"Went there in Dec(Winter), some rides was close as it was winter. Not very crowded as I think it was too cold. There is a shuttle bus from where u are to Everland, you just need to book and know where to board the bus. Even it is cold. It is still fun with the short queue."
My first Winter everland,"At first, I was quite reluctant to go due the cold weather. We arrived at 11 ish noon time, so it was almost lunch time. i skipped taking any heavy meal n save it later after our ride. Too afraid that I might puke! Lol Our first mission was to ride the fourth tallest rollercoaster in the world!T-express. Lucky we bought our Q-pass earlier via online and skip the long Q (approx 60-80mins of waiting). We got out first front row and the rest was a history. I did my very first ride ! Im the happiest human alive ! We managed to see the christmas parade as well. The place was clean and the staffs were very helpful and friendly. Not as crowded as we thought . Prolly it was on weekday. We didnt get to explore the rest of the adventure, but it was all worth it!

Good place to spend the day with the family,"Everland theme park is located about an hour's bus journey from Seoul. We pre-booked our package (bus + entry tickets) here in Singapore. The local agent picked us up promptly at 9.50am outside of Honggik station and proceeded to the other pick-up locations for the others. We arrived at Everland shortly before 11am, and after a short briefing, it was onwards to the fun!Unfortunately, due to it being winter, the park's signature ride, the T-Express was closed. The other thrill rides are ok, but I was really looking forward to getting my adrenaline boost. The place is big, so moving from one zone to another takes time. We were there during the weekday, so the crowds were not as humongous. Waiting times at the various attractions were reasonable. Not many options for food, its either burgers or KFC.Our package allowed us to stay until late, so the night parade and fireworks was really worth the price. The floats were all lit by fairy lights and looked amazing. The fireworks show was awesome. However, as most of the park's visitors have to get back to our respective buses by 8pm (which is when the park closes), it was a mad dash to the sky cruise cable car station once the fireworks ended. The entrance of the cable car is next to the bumper car, but even if you can't find it, just follow the crowd because everyone is getting out.Being out in the country and in December, the place is COLD COLD COLD. As I mentioned in other posts, it's not the body that gets the cold but the hands, feet and face. Bring along heat packs for your hand and feet."
Website Updated on Wednesdays,"We had planned to visit on a Thursday, but was disappointed to see (from Everland website program highlights) that the christmas parades and fireworks do not operate on Thursdays, Fridays... (while it was available on Mondays, Tuesdays...). The Everland representative (Facebook messenger) did not know why and advised me to call their enquiry line. I did, and discovered that their website are only updated on Wednesdays. Hence the programs for Thursday was not available yet. So misleading!As we knew that some rides are closed when the weather is too cold (or when it rains), we monitored the weather forecast and chose to visit on a weekday with sunny mild winter temperatures. Great choice! Most rides were open, and being a weekday, there was hardly any queue.The panda musical was extremely boring (unless you are a young child who can understand korean language). The Christmas parades weren’t too bad, though I preferred the ones at HK Disneyland.I absolutely loved Safari World! If you sit behind the driver, you can see him feeding the bears. They even “danced” for him. So cute!For the Lost Valley, try to sit on the right hand side as this is where the ranger feeds the giraffes.As night falls, temperatures also dropped and we were freezing in the cold, waiting for the night parade and fireworks. Luckily we brought some heat packs. Fireworks were amazing. Don’t miss it.On exit, we discovered there was no taxi stand... and I really didn’t fancy a long bus ride back to Seoul. A local told me to book a cab using KaoKao Taxi. Very easy to use. The trip back to Seoul cost us less than 50,000 won, much cheaper than if we had prebooked private transportation with tour agencies.Great day out. Highly recommended."
Everland on a weekend,"If you're a tourist, do not go on a weekend. We didn't realized until we couldn't ride anything because of the long queues! I wish we knew!"
Nice escape from the big city,"Nevertheless, you'll still meet the crowds... especially on weekends. Being the largest amusement park in the country it attracts many visitors. It's especially nice in spring, when the cherry trees blossom(usually in April) and autumn, when the make trees show their red leaves(usually best in October).The park offers a lot of different fun rides and shows. On weekends prepare to queue or be at the venue ahead of time. I'm not so fond of the zoo part or the safari area, as these animals seem not to have enough/ appropriate space. However I'm a big fan of the Dutch village at the bottom of the hill, add it serves German beer fresh from the tap. A bit pricier, but clearly worth it for me. As Korea does not feature many areas/ restaurants/ bars with outdoor seating like a German style beergarden, this is my little escape. Kids are entertained and parents can enjoy their time, too. "
so much fun,wanna visit again. Should try T-Express. must try! The workers were really nice and spoke enough English to communicate
Not worth going in Dec.,"With the entrance ticket, at the gantry, they will pass a day pass for use at every station. The day pass needs to be shown for entry to each rides or activities. However not recommended for Dec as the weather is not good for T Express to operate and now the roller coaster is down for renovation. Many of the stations are closed when I went there. Though it is winter now, the Alpine stations are not opened. It is not worth the money since many of the other rides are not functioning. Oh, they do have the day parade and it was the highlight for the day for the kids."
Huge theme park with rides for every kid ,"We went in winter, so there were no or very short queues. There are also many food options and shows. It would have been better if there were English descriptions at the entrance to each ride. We had to keep referring to the map guide which was time consuming.Also some attractions like Panda World close earlier that the park itself. This wasn’t made clear at the entry or anywhere at all."
Long queue for any game ,"We came here as it is part of the program arranged by the tour agent. We arrived Everland about 11am++ till 6pm on Saturday.Maybe, we picked the wrong day, it was weekend!. Just so many people every where you go, be it queuing up for games or food. Queued for 2hrs 10mins for the roller coaster ride. Any game you pick, you are bound to queue for at least 50mins. Those popular ones are much longer like the roller coaster ride. Even the cable chair queue was almost an hour. You can choose to walk and it was just less than 15mins walk.If you are coming on your own, highly recommended that you come early and spend one whole day here if you want to play more rides. After all, the entrance fees are not cheap, so should maximize the ticket usage :)"
Holloween ,"Went on Holloween and everything was Holloween themed. We spent a good amout of time just hanging out at the panda enclosure and rode the T express. Wasted time on a VR booth that was pretty lame. But overall it was good, i mean its not your famous brandname amusement parks, but it wasnt a cheap copycat also.As we were about to go home, we chanced upon the Holloween streetparty parade. It would have been great if there were some sort of english mixed in so that foreign tourists can also relate, but it was nice and pretty so it was ok."
Weekday trip was awesome,"We went to Everland on a Tuesday in late November with grandmom and three young kids. It was an amazing day and we highly recommend it. A lot of the rides and snack booths were closed for the winter but there were no lines and we could practically walk right on to every open attraction. There was a good mix of little kid rides, big kid/adult rides, and safari/zoo attractions. We wouldn’t say it’s equivalent to Disney (but it’s been a longtime since we’ve been to Disney and have never taken our kids so memories may be distorted). It’s more like a Six Flags with a zoo and safari but definitely took an entire day (10am - 6:30pm) even only half open.Be ready to walk around A LOT. They had a few ski lifts to get around the park and some moving walkways but my fitbit said we still logged nine miles. Also be ready to wait in line if you’re going in a busier time of year. As we walked up to the rides, we could see how long the lines probably get and it looked like the lines could be brutal.Since we were visiting from the US, I was originally against doing something we could easily do at home, but we had a great time and we learned that Grandmom really likes roller coasters. "
Half a day suffice,Bought a day pass from Klook. Half a day is sufficient. Lots of walking up slopes hence not suitable if u have old folks in your entourage. 
Amazing amusement park!,Adults and kids will enjoy this place. The place is huge to explore and the map is in the entrance. Must be a whole day activity.
"Amazing, huge park, but really overcrowded!!","It's maybe the most spectacular Amusement Park of S. Korea, very big with a huge variety of attractions.It's not so easily accessible from Seoul, as far as it's outside of the city, but, if you spend more than four days in Seoul, it worth a visit!However it is really overcrowded!!In order to enjoy your time there and to avoid wasting the most of your time, waiting on long queues, try to avoid -if possible- weekends and holidays! If not, you will maybe spend all of your time waiting on the queue and you will miss a lot of attractions!"
For All Ages,"I visited the park early December so the weather was chilly and nice in the morning, which made my stay there less tiring. There were a wide variety of rides, something for folks of different ages. Try to plan ahead to cover majority of the park as it was huge. We had poor planning and hence were not able to see all. If you have limited time, do make sure to see the zoo/safari (if it's open), ride the T Express (wood coaster), see the center of the park (the big tree), see the hologram concert, see the parade (in December I think it becomes the Christmas Light Parade which is even better), and see the Fireworks."
Theme park goal again,"The place is nice and considering the season I was there so I kinda like walking around with the chilly weather. Crowded with lots of people. You can't stop to start compare it Disney or universal studios if you have been there then you can tell the difference. But to me, it lacks something to reach my expectations but not bad to disappoint or even considering the thought of disappointment."
ride on rides,"It is the best amusement park in South Korea. Various events such as Halloween at October and water gun play at summer are prepared. Fireworks and parades at night are also great. We can enjoy fun and fun rides, and you can meet many different animals. There are also many delicious Jelly ans snacks. You can't get tired of playing all day long. If you want to make a memory with family or friend or lover, come to Everland."
Lots of activities for kids and family. Excellent Amusement park..and there are Pandas!!!,"Everland is an excellent amusement park with lots of activities to do for the kids and families. It's one of the 10 amusement parks in the world that has Pandas. There's a Safari ride, lost world (with many animals), thrilling rides like T-express (similar to Spiderman in Six Flags) and many more. There's discount for foreigners if you buy tickets through their website and show your passport. Excellent place for a full day activity with family all year round although Spring, Summer, Autumn are the best times to go."
A great day out with the family.,"Korea’s Everland is a fun way to spend a day. The park is large, in a beautiful natural setting, and has a variety of attractions. It can be crowded so plan to go right when they open and mid week if possible. Bring good walking shoes because you will do a lot of walking. You can also bring your own snacks and lunch into Korea’s amusement parks if you want to picnic. "
Come here only if you've not been to Disney,We went here on a Sunday and the lines were ridiculous! Some rides we had to wait for 40 minutes or so. The safari ride didn't have as much animals as advertised. We enjoyed the gardens though. Food inside is horrible. Come here only if you've not been to Disney or you'll just be disappointed. The parade were too short too.
Safari ride is good,Visited everland in early winter. Some of the rides were not available. The park is huge and at night was cold. We went on some kids roller coaster rides a couple of times since there was no queue. Hooray! The safari bus was really good. Close to animals and the speaking guide got the giraffe popping its head into the bus for some food! We got on the huge pirate ship at the high point of the park. The view from this is equally awesome
The lines are just ridiculous,"Overall, I’m not sure if I would go again if I had the chance. We had to wait for about an hour for everything, and at three they closed the T-express (the headliner coaster) for the day. The rides are good and fun, but you won’t get to enjoy much of them. "
Need to visit here again !,"All of us need to spend more than 5 hours here ! Oreo Churros is the best here ! The queue for T-Express train is so LONG! even when you have express ticket. Ohman.. I still have lots to cover here :( The queue is just so..... ohman.. Nevertheless, I will review again when I come here again ! :D"
Fun theme park but unable to cover much within a day with young kids!,"This is a very big theme park and there were 3 adults with 2 young kids; 4 year old girl and 6 year old boy.We started with visiting the Zoo/Safari area and we were only half done before going to catch the 2.30pm Carnival Parade which was catchy and awesome. There are many slopes and quite tiring to go from one area to another. By the time we complete the Safari, it was late afternoon and we headed for Four Seasons Garden which has really gorgeous flowers on display. Both kids had fun there although the train going around the Garden was closed when we wanna catch it at 5pm. By the time it was 6pm and we wanna do other rides, most were closed. Quite dampening of our spirits and coupled with the chilly wind, we eventually left at 8pm, not even catching the 830pm parade. As the journey to Everland is about 1.5 hours, will strongly recommend for families to set off early. For us, we reached about 12.30pm which was a little late. Otherwise, I believe if you can start from 10.30am and till 8.30pm for Parade and 9.30pm for fireworks, the day would be a lot more amazing. Although we enjoy Everland, I will not bring my kids again until they are older (maybe at least 8 year old) when they can walk more without feeling too tired. "
Lovely Park in Seoul,"This place is a perfect combination between children and Parent ""want"", there's beautiful View, Great playground, "
Never grow up at Everland! ,"This theme park has something for everyone: rides, shows, animals, food and shopping. The prices were reasonable; if there were lines, the were not too bad; and the food was good as theme parks go. During Halloween, Everland takes on a Halloween theme for those who like chills and thrills. Overall, it is a great way to spend the day!"
"Too much time queuing, not enough rides","The shortest queue was 60 minutes, and this wasn't even for a big ride. Looking at over 2 hours to queue for T express. There isn't enough rides in the place, they have so many food stalls (all with the same food) and not enough rides to reduce the queuing times. There's a few more things for children here, but not enough if you're coming as a group of adults. Not worth the trip from Seoul IMO. Got it half price though, so they sometimes run events where foreigners get 50% off, it's worth checking their website. There's also a lot or attractions that you have to pay an extra 5k to use. Didn't manage to get to zootopia unfortunately, but heard there was a 2 hour queue for that also."
Nice time spending outside Seoul,"Has a lot of attraction, mostly suitable for kids age 10 or aboveWe were on Halloween , so it was zombie styled, not appropriate for small childrenTips :1. we were on Autumn holidays, so tickets were half price2. better come by bus from Seoul, much faster than subways3. Park has lower and upper level, when going back up , use Cable Cars!4. If you are big family take with you walki talki"
Fun,Korea's version of Disney with a safari park where you're on a bus and the animals come right up to you to feed and/or pet!
Beautiful Place,"We purchase our tickets online which is cheaper for foreigner but dont forget to bring your passport as they need it as a proof.The place is too big and the staff are very helpful. We spend half of the day here. For muslim, do bring your own food/snacks as im not sure if the food sold is ok for you. Not to worry of praying area as they provide a small prayer room inside.There's also a big and clean nursing room. Everything you need for your kid is there. Awesome. I think the nursing room is so impressive that i kept remembering it instead of the big amusement place with colourful flowers :)"
Consistant Quality and Great Coaster,"This park probably has my favorite wooden roller coaster in the world ""T Express"". I would also recommend their animal exhibits for being unique, exciting, and high quality. It was especially fun to see the pandas and go on an African safari. The entertainment stage production Le Bao's Adventure was also good quality. Unfortunately the halloween program ""blood city"" was not family friendly and this meant there was little you could do to avoid it. You can take the metro to get to Everland from Seoul, but it is a long journey."
A little crowded ,"I went to Everland on 27 sept, I reached there at noon and it’s crowded with school trip students. Need to queue for 2hours to ride a T-xpress. "
An okay amusement park,"It takes some time to get there, and then you get to deal with lines for everything. It can be a fun day if you get there when they aren't so busy."
Less crowd than expected ,Went during midweek and there are not so much people than I expected to be. Most rides take no longer than 25 minutes queue I am pleasantly surprised. Permissible foods are available for Muslim as well as conducive space to perform prayer.
Too crowded during Public Holiday,We went to Everland on our 3rd day at Seoul (2/10/17). We took bus tour from Myeongdong. Depart from Myeongdong around 1050hrs & reached Everland approximately after 1 hour.It was too crowded during our visit due to Public Holiday at South Korea. Only had chance to ride 2 games due to long que & visit Panda World.If you plan to visit Everland during public holiday ensure to get the Q-Pass to avoid the long que.
"Not a big deal, but you can have some fun","It's a normal amusement park, but one of the main in Korea. The waiting time for main attractions is considerable, be prepared. They have an interesting zoo there, but the animals look very stressed and sad (what is kind of common in Korean zoos). There are not enough space for them, especially for the big ones. I saw one red and two giant pandas there but, again, they were very sad (and isolated one from another) - if going there only for the pandas, better to save a bit more money and visit them in China.The price of food was the expected for an amusement park and its quality was good"
So much Fun,"Great theme park with rides catering to adults and kids, variety of restaurants and there was also a zoo. T-express rollercoaster was awesome . Everland is a must do :)"
Best theme park in South Korea,Totally loved it!!! Not enough time to explore all the attractions!! Having super duper great time there! Halloween night was so cool!
Question,Will the park be open this weekend 29-01? If so will it be crowded cause of the holiday or will it be empty?
"Magical Place, it has everything!","Everland has everything! Buying an all day pass allowed us to go on most of the attractions. The place has a Zoo, Safari's, Roller coasters and Shows! The Coasters although low in quantity were all worth it, and some of the best i've been on, especially the T Express! Went on all of the Safari Attractions and this was a cool experience to see too! Since i went during mid September, Everland was halloween themed, and had one of the scariest horror mazes i have ever been in! Also try to get the later 9:30pm buses and shuttle packages as you do not want to miss the fireworks show! It was well made and spectacular, as well as the lightshows and parades in the area!"
Large and cool,"Everland is South Korea's largest theme park. Located at the Everland Resort in Yongin,This theme park is huge ,clean,multiple types parks and zoo. It was a nice day and we enjoy alot . There are many spot you should try like Thunder Falls,Amazon Express,Safari World and Lost Valley.It is fun and we will come again"
Funny ,"Large, clean, multiple types of fun i.e zoo, animal show, water show, telefrique, cinema, safari, cafe, bars, garden, pool....ect.Lovely shows for kids. "
too crowded,"by the time we arrive, there is so many people and we dont have a chance to try not even one thing to play (i think its a school holiday). so sad but i think the place is awesome. they even have a mini zoo! how great is that?"
Horror Maze attraction was so much fun,"Really enjoyed going through the Horror Maze. It was a lot of fun. It costs extra to go in, but it is worth it. You go in as a group of 4-6 people, single file. If you want to be frightened, be at the back of your group. If you don't want to be frightened, be somewhere in the middle."
Large but Less,"Everland Theme Park located out of the Seoul, as we stayed around City Hall so we booked shuttle service at City Hall Station Exit No. 5 and it took an hour to the park.The park is too large but there is less attracted activities for adult. Most of them are restaurants and souvinier shops. Few game station if compare with Universal.Zoo area seem bored as the display not much attractive even there are some rare animal show.As the everland no famous cartoon charecter, so we not enjoy much we expect such Disneyland.We tried Horror Maze at the bloddy city before we back. This was the most excited and creatively booth however we have to pay extra 5000 KRW at the entrance.If you are travelling with kid, the everland may recommended."
Must visit,"Think Disneyland this place is beautiful but definitely catered for kids. The parade was awesome!! Beautifully Christmas decorated. The only downside is that is build somewhat downhill very comfortable going down, but if you are pushing strollers going up hill it takes a lot!!! But definitely will come back plenty of food carts. "
The best amusement park in South Korea.,"I can not say I've been to a lot of amusement parks but certainly I've been to every well-known amusement parks in South Korea and I assure you it is best of them all. To give you little background of the amusement park, it was built in the middle of nowhere where CJ Food Corps used to fed hogs back when it was still part of Samsung Group. Well, now it is fairly well-developed area and easy to access from any cities within Korea so you won't have much trouble getting there. But still the park itself is surrounded by undevelopable high mountains' mother nature although fresh air, safari, 4 seasons garden are as close as you can get to her within the park. The park is full of attractions and multi-themed. It is really huge park covering 15 hectares of lands (I know its too darn huge) that they even have internally operated chairlift and train. It is impossible to ride every attraction in the park in one day so I advise you to stick to the attractions that really attract you. Spectrum of attractions that you can choose from is also wide. From kiddie rides to adventurous, extreme. And every attractions have their own concept which suits to the theme it belongs so you won't get bored just roaming around if you are not so good with the rides. And of course, for the entrance, it is quite generous considering or even not considering the quality of the park. For free pass (ride all you can), It is around 50 USD for walk-in, 46 USD for reservation via official homepage however If you are a subscriber of any of their over 100 partner credit cards, you will get 50% discount for. And you are every likely to have one of those credit cards if you are a Korean or at least lived in Korea for few years."
Our Seoul Jeju Winter Vacation 2012,It was our first family vacation back on Dec 2012 & its winter ☃️We went with our 12 mths old daughter that time & everland is a must go!It has baby services that i like especially for changing diapers & hot water but we do not manage to see the animal downstair.I like the shops available too.
First Impression,"I can't share much because i was on a school trip so i had limited time in there. I only rode about 3 rides. The very first Ride i rode was the epic roller coaster which falls nearly 90 degree downwards. I'm not a fan of roller coaster and have fear of height thus i didn't enjoy much.T Express(Roller Coaster): The scariest one I've been and i'm never going back because i have fear of height. Since Everland is located near the mountain, when reaching the peak of the coaster you literally can see the whole view of Everland. Because of the mountainous scenery surrounding Everland, you will as though you are on top of the mountain. When dropping, you can even see the bottom of the track and it feels like it's dropping at a 90 degree angle. Even though i'm not a fan of it, i encourage people to try this out.Other rides: Most rides include the pirate ship and some turning machines flying. Although it is not as high and heavy as the T express, you could still feel the weight in your heart.Environment: I went there during March so it's end winter to start of spring. I recommend to go during summer because you might feel chilly when riding on the rides since it's still cold, the wind generated from the rides will be freezing. Since it was the start of spring, there were many real live flowers and flower pots. I believe it is a romantic environment for couples. The gift shops are affordable, i recommend you to buy some souvenirs back. Food wise is also affordable unlike other attractions I've been. Overall: I think it's suitable for family,teens and children. There are a lot of rides and shows suitable for everyone. However the place is really huge that you need some sort of cable car to travel up and down the mountain. The place is also very step. Thus it's not really suitable for seniors. If you have kids do bring a stroller in case they are tired. I think you really need to spend the whole day there because i went there in noon till 6pm only to get about 3 rides. The queue is also quiet long during the weekday. I suggest an express ticket if you are going there once."
Had a blast here...highly recommend!,"We are Americans but are not strangers to Asia. We went for one day, on a Tuesday. Two adults and our 8-year-old daughter. Bought tickets online cheaper for foreign travelers. The weather was surprisingly good, not oppressive humidity for being August in Korea. It sprinkled a couple of times and there was some heavier rain as the park was closing but this did not detract from our day. We arrived around 11 or 12, it was not busy but we did have to park in a far away lot though there is a shuttle bus to the entrance which was nice. We rarely waited more than 20 minutes for any ride and in most cases less than that. Even the massive T Express roller coaster was not a long wait which we couldn't believe because it was an awesome ride! We did big rides and small. Ran out of time to see some of the animal exhibits. We did the safari ride on the bus and the water, both were really nice. On every ride, the operators are really into it, making it more fun. We don't speak or understand Korean but didn't need to, even where there were no subtitles or English signs (which are appreciated but not expected), it is easy to figure out where to go and what to do. Everyone was very nice, never a problem ordering food, getting on rides, etc. They have English maps which is nice. That said, we did a lot in one day but not everything as this park is so large, I think you need two days to do it all and that is without the standard long wait on busy days. We stayed for the fireworks at 21:30. They were nice and tied in with a musical presentation on a large screen. Did a little shopping after that and then back to the shuttle for the brief ride to the parking lot. Even the traffic getting out was light. I would highly recommend this on a weekday for anyone wanting to enjoy some rides or to see some wild animals. "
Daytour with firework display as Finale!,"We went for a daytour, it was a bit late afternoon but then we enjoyed a lot. I mostly like the four season garden as they have the different types of tulips. As the finale, the parade of the stars and the firework display!"
Best Outdoor Theme Park in Korea,"The attractions are great. They have a complete set of rides from water attractions, roller coasters, the classic merry go round, ghost houses, cable cars, and more. The signature ride is the T Express. One of the biggest wooden roller coasters in the world. To enjoy this ride you should line up and wait approximately until 2 hours because this ride is like everyone-have-to-go ride. One of the weaknesses of this place, it takes a long time to line up and enjoy popular rides. You spend almost half of the day just to ride T Express for barery 5 minutes! Other popular rides take in average 30 minutes waiting time. It goes worse on weekends. If you really want to enjoy especially T Express make sure to spare enough time to queue up. Everland is a perfect place to enjoy some adventures but also child-friendly since they also provide zoo, parks, and exhibitions for young visitors. Foods are okay;a little bit expensive but I think it's common because it's tourist attraction. They have korean street foods like tteokbokki, fish cake, and dakganjeong, korean restauraunts with full course meals, ready-to-go burger restaurants, coffee shops, even italian restaurants, they offer wide selections of what do you want to eat. Souvenir shops are everywhere, you can find them in every ride. They sell things represent the attractions like zoo, panda house or something like that. I especially love the sculptures and arts they place near the main gate and along the streets. They are beautiful and artsy. Line cafe and souvenir shop available here. Near the main gate you can find 8 seconds fashion outlets, Monami stationary shop, and even cosmetics outlet Etude House! "
A must visit tourist attraction!,"I love the four seasons garden, it is unique! I love the flowers and the nice decors. a must visit for tourist visiting Seoul. a nice and huge theme park."
Largest park in Seoul & Must Visit Place,"Approximately 2 hours from central. Everland park is the largest park in Seoul. Very big park with ZOO, Amusement Park, Kids Park, Flowers Garden & Nice food court. You can visit this place by changing few trains and while returning you can take bus from outside everland park. Its a big park so better to start from morning. Long queue in some rides. buying tickets online is the cheapest way. Dont miss this spot."
Great but Cold!!,"I was there on March...the weather was quite cold even in daylight...it was not only cold but windy..it was quite a disappointment when they closed the T-Express due to windy...yeah what can I say it's nature...overall the staffs were friendly...but I hope there are more multi-language...since every stop have their story..so if you are a foreigner with a need of subtitles like me, it quite a downward...overall love the dances...and foods too even tough it was quite expensive..might be going there again..opss forgot to mention..the day i went there, the line up was so little..so you might get re-played after a ride right away...*lucky me* trying up the viking like 4 to 5 times...feel sorry for my partner...oh they also sell the Express Pass...but for certain attraction only."
Best place ever,"Everland is in Young-in, it's not far from Seoul. Everland is very huge, a lot of things to do and there are many rides. It's good place to play with friends. The best part was when we pay with MasterCard, they give us 35% discount One-day pass. Therefore I played with friends whole day."
Best for kids,The most thing i remember about everland actually its grilled corn. Really the best corn i ever had. And the T-something roller coaster which i couldn't attend eventhough already on the line with friends because i still want to live for next year..
"Yippy more rounds, everyone?","Visiting on a Monday in June was one of the best decisions our tour made. Although it is unfortunate we visited in a time that T-Express was under maintenance. My parents and I visited Everland as part of our Dynamic Korea tour by Apple from Malaysia. It was Day 6.Everland was busy at the entrance but relatively empty once you walk beyond the array of souvenir shops that entice the eager shopper. Popular rides like the Water Raft and Bus Safari ride have long queues. However for the American area rides such as the Viking, you could more or less ride it non-stop without requiring a queue. Compared to other global theme parks. Eg. Disneyland, Gold Coast etc., Everland lacks splendour or familiar titular characters. Instead it has other variations of typical theme park rides. From the spinning cups, roller coasters, bumper cars. I rather enjoyed the lack of activity and crowd in Everland because it made it a lot easier to experience almost everything without getting stuck or bogged down by unnecessarily long queues. The toilets as per the rest of Korea, was clean. And water fountains are readily available to refill bottles throughout the theme park. A big headsdown for Everland though was their map. It was difficult to read, and equally as impossible to find out when times for particular shows were. So we gave up on seeing any shows."
Great park,"Everland is quite far from city centre..maybe needs 1.5 hours if you go by bus or metro,cause you must wait and change..so i chose everland bus package,it really minimize your time.we waited at the seoul station and just sit till the end..it took 1 hour.We went on Thursday,and it was not crowded..only 5-10 minutes waiting,also for T express..so we could play many attractions there.I love the beautiful park there,so many flowers,roses...and also the wild animal park,you could see bear's attraction"
A must see if you're in Korea!,"If you have time you must try to find a way to go to Everland. This Park is beautiful with all the different flowers scattered throughout the Park and the wait times for the rides were all within the 5-20 minute range. We spent 3 consecutive days here, from Monday-Wednesday and the wait times were pretty much all the same. The only issue with going on the weekdays is that some restaurants and shows tend to close during the week so plan your days accordingly. We pretty much walked every inch of the park and enjoyed most of the rides such as Safari World, Amazon Express, Lost Valley, Bumper Cars, Rolling X-Train and The Columbus Adventure. Their biggest and fastest coaster, The T Express we did not try since my 6 year old was not tall enough to get on. There are plenty of restaurants and small canteens to either eat or to grab some ice cream or some local treat like the Peanut Butter Squid. Also every night at 8:30pm they have a really nice Moonlight Parade to where they shut off all the lights in the Park along the parade route. Most of the employees in the Park knew some English and there were enough English signs and an English Park brochure to get by, not a problem. If you need a stroller you could rent one and if you need cash they have ATM's and even a money changer in the Park. To save money they have an Evermart right outside the Park before you enter, you could load up there with some bottles of water and other drinks and they also sell some food to that you could warm up and eat for later. They have some designated picnic areas in the Park for doing so. If you like beer like I do they have different areas selling different beers such as in the Holland area they have a lot of European beers there. If you have the time I would try to do at least 2 days here."
VISIT EVERLAND NOW!,"Touring Korea wouldnt be complete without dropping by to Korea's one of the largest theme park, EVERLAND! Everything about this theme park is cute, and i can personally say you cannot try all of their rides because you will be overwhelmed already by a lot of sceneries that you forgot your should try the rides too. hahaha.If you want to experience the Kim Bok Joo feels when she dated his hoot hoot swimmer boyfriend, then you should go here and try cute headbands and couple shirts. My Friend and I were talking that we think this is a cute dating spot for couples. A lot of cute couple accesories, romantic spots, photobooths,green lushes etc. makes us want to bring our own boyfriend here. haha! (Unluckily, we both dont have one, so we just satisfy ourselves watching other couples XD haha!)Since we went here during summer time, we were amazed that Everland provided a big fan that blows an air with ice cold water (I dont know what that thing calls :D), but it is a great help for those people that is not used to heat! There's also a fountain where children plays, you could also take a bath here.We were not able to complete the rides because the rides are too many, you wouldnt know what to ride first. But, we tried the safari wherein we saw different kind of animals like lion, tiger, giraffe, bears, and a lot more!!!! We think everland is a 3 in one place. (Rides, sceneries, and a zoo!). My personal favorite in Everland is the garden with a lot of different types of flowers. This is a perfect picturesque spot, and you could imagine yourselves walking down the aisle, with lots of petals on your ground, beside the man of your dreams. haha. *just kidding*. Theres a big dancing fountain, i think, and a palace, and a lot more! Restaurants are around but expect high prices for this and please, do not ever ever forget to bring a jag of water. hahah! My friend and i brought one, and it saved our life. Cause if you still do not know, bottled water is so pricey in Korea. Haha!All in all, everyone should try to visit Everland. You should wait for their parade every 8 pm and see the sparkling lights they offer to their tourist."
Fun day at everland!,"Beautiful amusement park that has lots of attractions for all different ages, also beautiful gardens and zoo part.Had lots of fun! Very recommended and its easy to get to from seoul with the bus and then free shuttle straight to the park!"
Excellent family theme park,"We spent the whole day in this excellent theme park. The T Express ride is epic! All the other rides were good and waiting time is from 5 to 20 minutes on a Monday so it was really good for us. Food at the Alpine resort was very good, thd garlic butter chicken was tasty and soft. The bbq combo was a good choice for us. Staff spoke English and was very enthusiastic, polite and professional. Our 10 year old had a blast and so did we!"
not as happy a place as before,"i returned with new friends this time for the fireworks at one of the restaurants. previously they said no reservation allowed so we would go early to get a spot. this time, every restaurant we went to said by reservation only. and staff are not as friendly as before. If this is so.. then state on the website. but not even a phone number. maybe the park's not really for tourists because last year i came with other friends in march and june - i took one vip program, the 2 korean girl guides helped us ask the restaurant for reservations in the afternoon.. told us they do not do it. and then suddenly it is only possible if we buy 2 sets for dinner. i thought this time we could do the same but guess not. so come on.. make up your mind on the rules. no interest in coming back"
Amusement Day,We had an amazing time at Everland! We enjoyed the festivities and rides. The customer service was great and it was an enjoyable experience. 
Two thumbs up!,"One day is definitely not enough for a theme park-lover. We definitely did not regret choosing Everland over Lotte World, even though it's located quite a distance away from Seoul. My suggestion is to list down the attractions in the order of importance, giving their proximity from each other a consideration. Visit the park on a weekday, instead of weekend, if possible.What makes this park unique is the Zootopia area where visitors can go for safari-like tour on amphibian vehicles (Lost Valley) and bus (Safari World). This is definitely a highlight for children. There are also small Petting Zoo. Other than that, the park boasts a large rose garden which is really stunning. The rest of the areas house the regular theme park favourites like roller coasters, fun houses, carousel, etc. There is even a phone app to tell the approximate queueing time for each ride.The park is clean, with clear signs. Facilities like restaurant, snack stalls and toilets are clean, well-maintained and can be found easily in all areas. Food prices are like any other theme parks in the world, on the high side, but taste-wise, they were surprisingly good.All in all, great ambience. I personally loved the pretty flowers dotting the whole park."
Amazing ... must visit when in Seoul,"Make it a part of your itinerary , though our tour guide's advice is make sure you go during the spring - summer and make it a weekday to skip the crowds . Theres so much to enjoy and see . From the thrilling rides to the beautiful rose garden and the different animals in the zoo , this theme park is simply amazing . Make sure to get yourselves aside from the entrance ticket , get the meal coupons too , food is good just make wise choices ..."
1 day is not enough for theme park lover,"yes you can get much here. thrill attractions, cute and photoshot, souvenir store.very crowded in holiday, long q in most attraction. but its worth.large area. upper and lower. explore them all"
A lot better than any Disney,"Don't expect Disney, but experience something new, something different. Get out of your cliches. Strongly recommended for Kids. huge Park, super friendly designed. My Son loved this place."
Amazing Rides!!!! Terrible Safari :(,"The rides variety is very good and the rides are very fun especially t express. Not so visitor friendly as most of the things are in Korean. Food stalls are reasonable and the tickets are reasonably priced if you get them from a third party site. The safari was great, however, I believe that the animals were underfed as they were too skinny and the bears were trained for entertainment of the visitors as the drivers made the bears perform for food. I believe that they should treat the animals much better. "
Good value as it is a theme park cum zoo,"It is indeed a unique concept to have the zoo within the theme park. There are a couple of ways to tour the zoo, via bus, private tour, boat and walking. The nice surprise was the pair of panda for me. But I really don't like the state of the animals in Everland. For example, we saw very skinny tiger and bear. The polar bear enclosure is also not airconditioned... hence, we felt that we are contributing to animal abuse in a way by supporting and visiting Everland. Hope that Everland can continue the good concept by treating its animal well. The panda enclosure was a very impressive one. The rides in the park was very fun for teenagers as there are exciting rides like T-express, rollercoaster and twister etc. Only thing is that many of the instructions were only in Korean, so we didn't know how to get fast pass to save time. I don't mind the main spoken language in Korean, but it would be great to have instructions on English. Hope Everland can look into it. If you take time to enjoy Everland, a day would be too rush. Crowd today was managable, as it is not the weekend, but still we wait closed to 1.5hr for the T-express. Generally, I like the rides as Everland give good duration for rides which makes the queueing worth it. Another suggestion would be for Everland to give single rider a chance if there is empty seat for rides... that would speed up the queue. Overall, rides is efficiently and well managed. Funny and entertaining staff manning certain rides too. However, the staff at restaurant and kiosks are not so nice and friendly. "
Must go when you visit Seoul,The themepark is huge. You can spend the full day inside the park as it consist of zoo and flower garden as well. 
Best day ever!,"This is a place for kids and young at heart. I personally believe that this amusement park is better than Disneyland. It just so happened that Disney characters are famous mainstream. So this park has the usual rides catering to children and to extreme thrill-seekers like me. So what’s special about this park is that it has gardens and zoos. I love how the park is filled with beautiful plants and flowers. The ticket is definitely not cheap so in order to make use of it, come here as early as possible for you to be able to try at least all the rides and see the zoos and gardens. Also, just spend the whole day here and wait at night (MWF) for the beautiful parade and fireworks display."
Great Park ... but Glampers watch out !,"My wife, my (now) 5 year old son, brother in law and myself go to Everland as a family every year. The park itself is very nice, well kept, fun and entertaining. This year we decided to stay overnight and saw they had a ""GLAMPING"" option. We read through the related page on the Everland website and decided to book. While we were at it, we booked a VIP bbq dinner. The picture shows a proper chef, at a small bbq and we wondered if we would have a personal chef for a little while to take care of the cooking. The bbq wasn't cheap so we thought it might be a possibility.Small suitcase in the lockers, we headed off to have our fun around the park. Come early evening we make our way to the designated 'meeting area' expecting to be met and shown off the park to the Glamping site. The meeting area turned out to be the actual Glamping site itself (so IN the park ... we should have realised right there and then something was amiss). We 'check in' at the glamping site reception area and we are told we have misunderstood, this area is for DAY USE only, NO SLEEPING on the site. It seems they have a not understood what glamping is. Their webpage even compares their Glamping as an alternative to other local hotels. We realise that we have about an hour before the park closes and our $$$ (Won) and that we will have to do the 3 hour trip back home. We decide to still have the VIP bbq before we go, it's late, we are exhausted and very Hungry. Our 5 year old is crying (and he doesn't usually cry). We are brought what can only be described as a hodgepodge of saussages and other meats in a military style tin platter, a couple of beers, a couple of cokes and 2 or 3 pot noodles. Plastic utensils and disposable plastic plates.We spent about an hour on the phone to a manager and finally got a refund for the non-existant Glamping. They never admitted doing anything wrong or that the advertising was misleading and ended up saying they were doing us a huge favour. (Yeah, right). Never again NEverLand !"
A perfect date spot or place to spend with your family,"I've been to Everland twice and loved both times. If you're into rides like I am, you'll love Everland. Even though I went on a Thursday, the place was still pretty packed. Expect long lines for their popular attractions. Im not into the parades or fireworks but they have them every night around 9pm(?)."
"Visited May 4, 2017",A helpful hint: We made a mistake by going there during a holiday and it was super crowded. Traffic was really bad getting there so we missed the 1st Fantastic Wing bird show that we wanted to see. The 2nd show was canceled because they couldn't get people off of the lawn who were standing in line waiting for another venue.Be sure to be selective on the dates you choose to go to Everland; especially on special holidays.
Theme park for young and old,"I visited Everland as it was part of the travel tour. I spent about 3 hours in there and basic on what I have observe, the theme park are for young and old. There are high thrill ride of roller coaster, to garden views, kids ride, water show, zoo bus tour and shopping area!"
Great themepark,"It was fun and bright experience for us, T express is a must do attraction, fireworks and light carnival was great to watch. Great feeling to play in this themepark, Food inside the restaurant are delicious and at reasonable price. If you take the shuttle bus, check the timetable accordingly esspecially for the last available bus at night."
Fantastic!,It's a very enjoyable place! The trees and flowers are just wonderful! The rides and the themed attractions can just make anyone happy! Definitely worth the travel!
At Everland,Oh! It was fantastic and great scenic views! It made our so wonderful and enjoyable. I would love to recommend it for a family tour with children .
Great place for kids!,Worth a visit! Very enjoyable! Love the lost valley and amazon express! Spent half day with just animals. Didn't have time to try other attractions.
Beautiful Flowers In Everland ,"We took subway to Gangnam station, take bus 5002 ( about 45 mins ) then change to Everland Shuttle Bus then we finally reach destination. It was a long journey to go Everland by public transport. Glad that we took the effort to goEverland. The flowers in May was so beautiful. We went during the holiday season. So it was very crowded and long queue everywhere. It'sa nice place for taking pictures. Worth going !!"
Took me by surprise ,This place was unexpectedly fun to visit although it was very very far from Seoul(took me 3.5 hours to reach by train). The rides looked amazing. I didn't ride many as I went there on my last day in Korea (which was a mistake) so I was in a huge rush to ride and take pictures here and there. I didn't wait in any lines as I was there in the morning of a weekday. I will definitely come here again. 
absolutely ridiculous waiting time,i specifically decided to come here on Monday expecting great time with my family without long queues. what i saw impressed me - everyone you go there is 30-90 minutes waiting - that is horrible! it is total waste of time. at least they inform about it and you can decide yourself but some counters didn't work so we stayed. overall park is nice place but they have to change charge system - why would i pay 50$ to end up visiting 1-2 things??? looking at the size of parking lots - HUGE - i think on weekends that place is TERRIBLE! now add summer heat and you get something to avoid visiting!!! best memory - 2 pandas that unlike those in HK were playing and eating in front of us.
Full of rides,Oh i love this theme park. The ambiance is so good. Very one with the nature. And it really has an extreme rides. Wandering around is so good. Cool view also. ❤️
Rides and fun,It was raining when we visited here. So we just chose indoor activities. I love the Zooland coz i enjoyed seeing the tigers lion and the bears.
Better than Lotte!,"Maybe cos it's winter and outdoor, there were not as many people as Lotte World. Getting there took some time as it is a tad far from the city. The park is big too and we were able to do more rides here especially the T express which I read online that it could be closed. Too bad the tix we bought online did not offer option of going early morning to return after fireworks and we had to leave at 6pm, could have taken a couple more rides as people get lesser towards evening. Worth beating the cold to go!"
A Different Theme Park Experience,"This is a different theme park if you often Disney or Universal Studios. The Korean touch is there and its a mix of different theme in one. There are Animals, Thrill Rides, Characters and even gardens. Choices of foods are extensive and the whole park is not that big which is a plus since you wont be too tired after spending one day."
Very crowded place,Alot of things to do here. Just that too crowded. I got my tickets at FUNKO with transport. Recommend you to take the Q-Pass as well. 
Gorgeous Park,"The thing that jumps out to you immediately with Everland is the wonderful landscaping. With the exception of the America themed area, the horticulture and general appearance is fantastic. The ride collection is not quite as interesting to me. T Express is truly a top roller coaster, but there is a big drop off in ride quality after that. The safari rides are quality, the shoot 'em up dark ride is decent, and the flume ride is fun. After that, nothing jumps out as being very great. Note that the park operates on a bizarre Fastpass system that has two distributions in the day. For example, T Express had distribution times at 10 then 3. The park could definitely use a few more rides, but the landscaping makes up a little for the lack of top shelf rides."
Extreme,"We arrived by Subway... the amusement is huge and the Q is very long for each ride... my b we choose the wrong day.. we went on friday and there are so many korean teenagers and babies.. may be its school holidays in korea... we started the Q for T-Express at 12:20 the Q is insanely Long and tiring... i almost gv up on queuing... once we ride Texpress, it very extreme and fast... other rider is crying its heart out.. we went out from texpress at2:30pm... just for one ride... its better to checked the korean public holiday and its worthed to buy Qpass to skip the line.. I didn't manage to buy Q pass because i just bring enuf money to eat.. i left my wallet at the hotel... pity me.."
Everland never end,"The theme park is huge, it'll take 2 days to try all the rides. We came on a weekday so the park is not so crowded, even for the most popular rides like T-express & amazon express, we only need to queue for 30minutes. The T-express is too fast for me, I feel dizzy & headache after this ride. Amazon express is fun, but you'll get wet due to the water splashes. I like the safari tour, especially the floating bus, and you can feed the giraffes. Foods serves in theme park is not really good, recommends to bring some street food, cheaper & better"
Spent whole day there,"overall the park is full of joy and fun. I did pay extra to try the VR experience, it costs 5,000 won each and u can experience for about 3 - 4 min However, the restaurants there opens at 1130hrs, so you better have breakfast first before you get there."
Very nice theme park!,I was very impressed with Everland. They had a wide variety of attractions and the entrance fee was very reasonable. Highly recommend!
a place for everyone,"I am not a theme-park type of person. I prefer shoping or city strolling than spending all day long in a theme park. But my friend insisted going here so voila, there I am. It was raining from all the way in the morning and afternoon. I thought that rain would ruin everything but turned out I was super wrong. Yes it's so cooooldd and you have to wear coat and umbrella, but there was something romantic in walking under the rain enjoying the cherry blossom, foliage, cute houses and flowers and taking pictures in the tulip garden. We had amazing time, let me list some of those for you : 1. we tried VR adventure in a huge simulation machine and it was soooocool, a MUST try. 2. we got into a bus in safari world and took a look at super handsome lion tiger and walking-in-two-foot bears, unforgettable3. we we tried the crazy T express that almost made me faint x_x4. Luckily the rain didnot last and we still got to watch the fireworks which was amzing and I felt like it is new year again :D I think Everland is suitable for everyone, from toddler to grands, women, men, girls, boys, you can do evertything here, even in the rain."
Good theme park for a day of fun,"Everland is indeed a well run theme park... but we were pleasantly surprised it also has a nice zoo... with great exhibits including pandas, giraffes and tigers!"
Fantastic!,"Visited during the Tulip Festival in early Spring (Apr) with Trazy Tour.Worth spending the whole day and can skip the musical play (more for kids).The Safari ride is recommended, try sitting at the left side nearer the driver as you would get to see standing bears coming close to the bus.The park has a higher altitude and lower altitude section and some areas are only opened in certain season (eg. winter ski).Most rides are found on the higher segment near to the entrance.The beautiful flower parks, ferris wheel, train rides are found at lower segment.Make sure not to miss the evening time when the lights are illuminated, you get to see another beautiful aspect of the theme park."
wet day but overall still fun,"recommended to check the weather before booking.. it was a wet day but turned out to be great..plus for a wet day is that pretty much every line was short! waiting time avg 10 mins.. go to the safari rides during rainy day though a walk away.. when the sun came out, most rides were up again.. overall kids and grand parents enjoyed"
Wonderland visit,"This is place for young and old. The kids can enjoy the safari with their parents, the young can enjoy the rollercoaster and the very senior can relax in the garden. It is place for everyone.This Everland is divided into 5 theme - Global fair, American adventure, Magic land, European adventure and Zoo topia.The panda is attracting alot of people as well as the safari which is so close to the animals. There are many games for the young - T Express, Thunder Falls, Rolling X-Train, Columbus Adventure, Safari World, etc.Always take your time to enjoy whole facilities the whole day."
Good park ,"Good amusement park in Seoul for all ages... Don't miss the safari -- lots of animals that most don't get to see up close everyday (giraffes, bears, rhino). The tulip festival was breathtaking and the T express roller coaster was a thrill as well. "
Great Theme Park Carbon Copy of Disneyland,"Though not as popular as Disneyland, Everland boast its own set of characters that will make both kids and adults alike enjoy the park. The size of the park is as big as Disneyland HK and the features are amazing. Fun shows and rides will make your visit lasting and memorable. Good thing I didnt listen to the 14 stupid people who rated this location poor. My daughter who is 5 years old had a great time eventhough she didnt know the characters at all. A must visit when in Seoul."
Awesome! Nice choice for family trip,We had purchase Q-pass for 4 facilities. Very worth it because can skip the long queue. Zoo-topia area very suitable for family and very nice!! Will come again 
Must visit theme park.,Everland theme park is a must park visit if you are in Korea.Even thought it is about 1hour drive from Seoul but it is worth the long journey.The theme park itself is very big.The park is categorised into 6 parks I would suggest that you reach the theme park as early as possible.My family and me spent 10 hours there but we didn't get to enjoy all the rides.We were there from 10am till 8pm.For those with younger children do not miss the safari park.For the thrill seekers there's this giant roller coaster that worth trying.We really enjoyed ourselves.
Make sure you go when the weather is good ,"Park has wide range of activities for different age group (animal show, roller coaster rides and VR) and be prepared to queue. We went on a day that is rainy and we didn't managed to cover most of the park. Some rides will be closed if the weather is wet and some are replaced with VR (ferries wheel). There's 3 different types of cable car rides within the park too but the two seater is closed due to rain. Overall park is friendly to all age groups (extremists/ adventurous to kids friendly)"
nice themepark for family,"we went there on the afternoon.. in very cold winter day.. so not realy enjoy the attraction...many attractions.. but limited time.. so only try a few..me.. Exploring the souvenir shop near the gate, taking a free cable car, my kids trying roller coaster,..nice place for your family.. especially when you came in nice weather...A MUST VISIT!!"
Happiness for kids and family...,"Everland is the must visit for kids and family in Korea. If you have visited Disneyland in Hong Kong, Universal Studio in Singapore, Everland is nice amusement park same level with others. We have to spend 1 whole day for this place due to long queue."
Enjoyable experience ,"Take train to gangnam station, take exit 10, go straight until giordano and zebra crossing, take bus 5002 and you will reach bus terminal. You need to take free shuttle bus to everland there, around 10-15min to reach everland."
Wonderful Everland,A great place for family. My sons really enjoyed the roller coaster and the cable car. We're having fun and enjoyed the parade of magical and moonlight shows. It was so amazing!I love the fireworks.... 
The most ominous rollercoaster I have ever seen!,"This is a great place to visit, especially if you are travelling with teens. We went during just before Halloween and there were some amazing attractions. I don't do rollercoasters, but my kids loved T-express!"
Family with young children.,"Finally im here..tis is more for adult.For children best is lotte world.Weather sunny but cold n more cooler at night..kids enjoy e rides n we didnt manage to complete all rides s reached ard noon..e journey is far..nevertherless, we had great family time here.."
Exhilirating,This is one of the best amusement parks I've been to. Make sure to arrive early to get a chance of the best rides without the line. Tickets can be purchased on the gate of the park or at your accommodation at discounted price. You can opt for a bus from gangnam or go subway all the way (which I find more interesting). Some of the rides operate at different times so make sure to check each of the rides once you arrive. It can get pretty cold during early spring so be sure to bundle up. Also put on your best walking shoes a it is an uphill and downhill walk.
Korean Disneyland,"Not enough time..that is what I've told my friends. Reached Everland ,you have to experience the Safari land first. The animal were well taken care and you enjoy seeing the bear reacting to the drivers feeding them. Take a ride on their roller coaster ...it is out of this world. Make sure enter early in the morning..because in noon it will be packed with visitors."
Fun for all family members ,It was fun for all family members. Every thing make me happy specially the small buildings. The food was nice too.
"everland, ever joy!","the biggest theme park that i ever go. one day will never be enough to cover everything. make sure you enter it early in the morning, or you will miss out many things. and try to go in weekdays rather than weekend. less people in weekday, less waiting time for every ride. don't forget to try that wooden rollercoster, you will experienced how your heart stop beating for a moment! good place for adrenaline junkie"
A winter wonderland,"Everland is like a winter wonderland. I can't describe the overwhelming feeling when I saw most of the trees and plants covered in snow. The snow slide was extremely fun for all ages. It's just that we can't take pictures or video during the slide. In the evening, when everything was lighted, it's like you're into a different place again. I want to go back here."
A unexpectedly pleasant experience,"Despite the hour long transportation from the middle of Seoul, it was all worth it. I visited during December and it was a great experience. The rides are enjoyable, but what I enjoyed most of all was the atmosphere. Very romantic at night with all the garden lights, not to mention the exquisite safari. Suits people of every age, as well as families and couples. One day was not enough!"
Check which rides are open,"We visited Everland in winter (February).At the time, the wooden roller coaster was open but we opted not to ride it but it definitely seems to be the highlight in this amusement park. We visited on a Friday and crowd was tolerable. But there is quite a significant wait on the ""teenager"" rides. We stayed until the ""illumination"" but it was nothing to shout about. Highlight of the trip for me was the safari and seal show. Food was affordable and relatively good (we had the jajangmyun from the chinese restaurant, hot bars and flavored ice from the food stands as well as churros). There is also a panda show and pandas in this amusement park.It's South Korea's answer to Disney (with the shows and everything) with a mix of Ocean Park (HongKong) thrown in there (what with the Pandas and animals, cable car rides to go to the other zones) but lacked Disney's magic and Ocean Park's variety. Worth going to if you have adventurous friends/have a full free day in Seoul."
Love it!,"A theme park for every ages. Safari is worth a visit. You will find pandas here too. The park is very huge and you won’t be able to finish every attraction. A lot of walking and there are many slopes. Adventurous ride, kiddies games and family ride, there are many variety that suits different ages and preference. The parade was so attractive and the decoration are awesome. Light shows and fireworks are very good. There are many small dance show throughout the day too. It was a long ride from Seoul, takes about 2 hrs on metro and a few transfers. . I love this park so much!"
Can't wait to go back!,One day pass is not enough! We started early - as soon as they opened - until 6PM. I guess we have to get at least a 3-day pass next time. :)
Theme Park in winter,"Visited Everland for a day in winter with family and friends. It was cold but a good day out. Some of the rides such as the large roller coaster were closed but the highlights were the pandas, the smaller roller coaster and the sledging. The lights in the evening was also nice. Best to take the bus from Gangnam Station ( about 40 minutes)"
Huge Theme Park,Coming to Everland in winter is a disadvantage since many rides are closed during this time such as T-express. But there are upside for coming in winter is that the line is shirt. We never have to wait more than 10 mins to enjoy the rides. Also snow buster is only available in winter. Safari world is A-Must because you will see the cutest and most adorable bears in the world.
everland,to the everland train ..it was quite easy but it took several hours of riding from seoul ..the place big but kids will enjoy it more than adults ...spend half a day walking around ..
Fun For All Ages!,"Everland is an exceptional theme park that has something for everyone, including (but not limited to) a zoo, water park, roller coasters, myriad restaurants, live entertainment, and a massive rose garden. I try to go at least twice a year (it's open year-round), and I've never been disappointed. It is simply impossible to do everything Everland has to offer in one day. So if you decide to go, you may want to check into one of the many hotels located in the area. That, or you can easily travel using Korea's monorail, aptly named 'Everline'."
Huge. Afternoon to Night experience. Different.,"We went on 16 December 2016 on Friday. Touched down at Incheon, check in in Dongdaemun history & culture park area, got a return bus trip from 12.30pm to 9.30pm from Funko that picked us near our place.So it's an afternoon to evening session at Everland.The place is huge!If you are going for this late session then my advice is when you reach there, read the map and plan quickly where you want to head to. This is because, you will reach there around 2.30pm.... and the day gets dark very soon. By 6.30pm, most of the games, are closed already. Remember, every game, there are queues. So you won't get to play much.However, there are night show mainly with lights and fireworks. Very nice show. So it's a totally different experience at night. Since it's winter, and it's night, it was super cold at -4deg. We were freezing, but worry not, there are some indoor places like shops and restaurant that are still open and heater located at random places along the pavement.In terms of food, there are no halal certified restaurant but there are shops selling churros and non-meat pancake, corn, ice-cream etc. I love their churros, hot crispy and big. Hot coffee are everywhere.There is a musollah (prayer room) with heater. Warm and cozy inside.If you are going with children and/or planning to take all the rides/games, go early!There are lockers near the entrance/exit for you to put your bags."
The snow sledding was so much fun!,"Unfortunately, attending in winter did have some downsides - some of the rollercoasters were closed; but it definitely had some perks including no lines and snow sledding. We also really enjoyed the safari. The food was delicious (something that cannot often be said about theme parks). Overall, a great day activity. NOTE: the website had some great discount coupons for foreigners as well as detailed information on where to catch the bus to get there."
Honeymoon @ Everland,"Simply magical.It is a very huge outdoor theme park. You might get lost in the theme park.We watched 2 indoor shows but we felt that it was a waste of time. No meaning and ""wow"" effect. Shows are in Korean language.The tour in a vehicle to view the endangered animals (tigers, lions, giraffes, bears, hippo, zebras, etc etc etc) is ""wow"". Must try! It was fascinating. They are so close to you. The bear is very cute - performed by turning rounds when fed. You may also pre-book small vehicle to feed the tigers and lions.We went on a weekday and it was winter so there isn't many people. Despite that, we did not play any games in the theme park but just to take beautiful photos."
Good fun,"If Lotte World doesn't make anymore sense then you may like to come an outdoor adventure fun place! I didn't take train or bus, but Taxi! It's ok not too expensive but with more flexible time.In fact it was a cold day, visitors please remember to bring enough clothes, masks, gloves.....etc to keep you and your kids warm. If not, there are many restaurants, get a cup of hot drink may help. "
Full of fun...,"A great place for family. My sons really enjoyed the roller coaster, the best they said. Little kids also were having fun and enjoyed the parade of magical shows and fantasy world. It was so amazing!"
Halloween In The Everland,I love to visit theme park whenever travel around the world. Surprisingly to line up for each rides is very fast compare to Disneyland in Japan & Hong Kong. We bought tickets online from KKday. We took train to Gangnam station and ride on a free shuttle. A great place to hangouts with family & friends. We love it very much!
one whole day,"make sure to spare a whole day in your itinerary if you're planning to go to everland. the long lines will take forever thus, you'll only be able to enjoy a few rides. also as much as possible, avoid weekends as the volume of people is doubled. if you're going on a weekend, aside from other tourists, patrons will also include the locals. if you want to experience T-express, then brace yourself, because the line is a blockbuster.if you're not adventurous, you can still enjoy everland. make sure to stroll until the very ends. you wouldn't want to miss anything."
Main point: roller coaster,"I spent the whole day here and It's just not enough to explore all. Lots of attraction that you can ride. If you can't take scary ride, don't worry there are still attractions that you will enjoy.My favorite : Panda !!The best attraction: Wooden roller coasterWorst part: located in a mountain so you need to go hike and it's tiring"
Enjoy this place with your family,"This is a large theme park in South Korea, The owner of Samsung had built it for his son and then it become open for publicNot only Theme park, it also had a zoo"
Better visit in spring,My daughter liked it here. Too bad we came in winter so it was really cold and windy. A lot of animals in the zootopia area weren't there due to the cold weather. But the animals will always be there on spring time. The area of everland is big. The food at the restaurants are just ok. We will definitely coming back in spring
Attractions for all level,"I've been to this theme park twice...first time was raining and i cant enjoy the ride much2nd time was sunny and great weather..we really enjoy the T-Express ride...i believe it was the most extreme roller coaster that i've ride because the track made from wood..so you can hear the cracking sound during the ride...For muslims, this theme park provide a small prayer room but you need to take turn between ladies and men since its a sharing prayer room.It's a huge theme park and come as early ad possible so that you can try as much as u can"
Thrilling,"Must try T-express, the main attraction here. Better buy vip pass for this game or you'll be queuing up for more than an hour to get a ride. Bought ticket from Funkorea website, hassle free. Really exciting theme park..."
Outdoor theme park,"Hmm i dont know because the weather or not but many attractions are closed, very disappointed, but this theme park very large"
The Korea's Disneyland of its kind!!,"It was a day trip to and from using the Evercab promotion from their website. I was so surprised that it looked like Disneyland and of course they have their very own design and characters that you will love them all!! It was a huge park that is good for all ages and get fun with! Of course, don't compare Everland with Disneyland because both unique in their own way!. I got the Qpass and trust me, worth the value for two tickets with transportatuon in C-series. Mr. Kim was super nice and had helped me to claim the tickets. You need to stay in touch with good people. You will enjoy to the fullest and our first time to a theme park on Winter time. You can't trust your eyes with that huge crowd local people e joying their annual pass and lots of games and shows for you! The type of food and snacks were at every corner taht you won't feel hungry any single bit of time. I have played the faster T Express was super awesome! Don't miss out the Rolling X-Train too. Get yourself ready without carrying your little gadgets as you will be asked to put aside. Just enjoy the speedy rides!! There goes the Snow Buster sleighing from 220m down to the bottom after a massive long queue. Well, worth the queue. It was like a click and you ssshhhhhhhh down just like that!! No worries, children under 120cm need to be accompanied by a guardian or parents. Just have fun playing, watching, shopping and don't forget the Zootopia, Magic in the sky, Panda and many more. Some we missed it but still, the garden of Winter was amazing decorated with windmill and some beers for you to hand around with friends and families. A dedicated children area was fun and exciting too! I went for the ice-cream and cotton candy~haha!There have a wide range of things for you to choose from. I believe in other season, you could find different amusement experience all together!!"
The best Amusement,Everland is the best amusement park in South Korea. T express is a must. Other rides are exciting and thrilling as well.
Good day at the amusement park!,"Everland is a theme park, good for family, animal lovers, adrenalin junkies alike. They have the kiddie rides, the exhilarating rides and a good mini zoo. The two safari rides were good, the mini zoo was amazing, especially so for kids. Even though i went in winter, the animals were still active. The rides cant be compared to disney or universal, even slightly dated, but everland does not market itself to be a disney or universal. The only similarity is that you can spend a whole day at both without feeling too tired.Good place for the whole family. Do cater a day if you are going there."
Would come here again,"Everland lived up to my expectations. It has a couple of animal safaris as well as several rides which i highly recommend. Since i went during winter there weren't many people and not much queue. Prepare a poncho as it might rain. Try to stay till nightfall to see the beautiful light display, during Christmas the decorations are more spectacular."
Nice theme park with mini zoo as well..,"You can find anything here in this theme park..mini zoo, arcade games, rides etc. Those who wants to have adrenalin rush they can find some of the rides here as well. Beautiful place to take pictures with their buildings and beautiful lights.."
A big big amusement park!,Everland actually allows you to enjoy the whole day without feeling tired and bored. T-Express is the highlight and do visit the Safari World and the rides!
Magical,"I wouldn't compare this to Disneyland because they are obviously very different theme parks, but this one really made me feel like an excited kid again, even though I'm an adult. Really liked their animal 'exhibit', where you get to sit in a tram and move through the animals - much better than seeing them being locked up in a small space. Their shops also offer a wide variety of souvenirs, everything from candy to cosmetics!"
Wonderful Little Knock Off of Disney,"While this doesn't hold a candle to Disney, it's a wonderful place to see and definitely worth a visit if you're in Seoul, especially during the Christmas season. The lights are beautiful and they have many nice shows including fireworks, parade of lights, and some great light shows times to the music. I wasn't particularly impressed with any of the rides though. They even have a Ferris wheel that doesn't even move. They just give you VR glasses and you pretend you're moving?!? Food leaves a lot to be desired also. "
Everland Seoul,"You can do this without a tour operator. Buy the tickets online at discounted price of abt USD33. Taxi costed me KRW50,000 from Itaewon which was okay since there were 4 of us. Ride took 50 mins by taxi otherwise about 2hrs by train. we enjoyed close encounter with the animals as much as the rides hahaha A must-go attraction when in Seoul. Overall Rating : 4.5⭐️ for variety, Q-time & generous space No halal food for Muslims tho Mussolah avail. So u have to pack your own food. They won't check your bags unlike other theme parks. "
Enjoyable Rides,Enjoy the T-express. Korea's steep wooden roller coaster! Try out their Sky Cruise ride or the Roller coaster. It is definitely a good place to visit for kids and kids at heart
amazing theme park!,"Everland is a Korean own theme park. there a lot of ride which is very interesting (even to adults!) To go here, take a subway to Gangnam (Line 2) Exit #10. Take city bus (bus no 5002) to Everland. To go to the city bus stop, take Exit #10 from Gangnam station. Walk straight until you reach end of the block & there’s a zebra crossing. Continue walking down another block and cross another zebra crossing. The bus stop will be in front of a clothing shop, WHO.A.U (shop will be on your left).Once you reach Everland parking area, take a shuttle bus into Everland Resort. The Shuttle bus is provided free."
Great wholesome park!!,"This is a great and wholesome park for the whole family. You have exciting rides like roller coaster with loops or great heights and drops; ski lifts, cable cars, safari rides where you see many animals... brown bears, lions, tigers, giraffes. There are also mild rides suitable for younger children.Now, during winter, they have sledding on two hills. One intermediate and one children's one for the time being. The largest one will open later. Do not forget to visit Korea Pride, where you get to enjoy interactive activities to learn about Korea history, see the sights (VR) and costumes of different dynasty. Can give the rotating house a miss. Nothing amazing. Korean is the main language used here, though there are English signages. It's a pity that there are no English speaking safari buses as there is plenty of commentary about the animals that got the locals to oooh and aaah but we do not understand at all. There is a parade at 2plus pm. Great winter parade!!! "
Amazing Theme Park,"EVERLAND is South Korea's largest theme park. It was a bit far. Took the subway to Gangnam, then a bus which was almost one and half hours. At the payment booth, they asked what country do I came from and they gave me a 5% discount. It was a very long, boring queue to “Lost Valley.” We boarded an open-air amphibious vehicle where we get up close with elephants, giraffes, zebras and flamingos. During October, the giant garden was decorated with pumpkins and skeletons, along with many guests taking advantage of the various goofy and spooky photo opportunities, scary face paintingThey also have an area for restaurants. Ate at KFC, ordered 2 pieces hot and crispy chicken, fries and medium-sized drinks"
Everland,"It's better to pay and take a shutter bus (40 mins) at 8.30am to reach there. Train journey take around 3hr. Shutter bus leave ard 5pm, park close ard 8 or 9pm. There is still rides available at night so if u want to enjoy the night view, u can take the train back to Seoul city. Interesting amusing park like Disneyland. This is Korea local disneyland. Famous for the wooden roller coaster. "
Interesting park and worth the visit ,"It's a massive park. Avoid weekends. With our offer tickets from klook, all rides were free and not much queue on weekdays. Stay for the moonlight parade at 7pm. Plan the journey in advance as it is far from Seoul city center. "
I love the safari zoo!!,"A place to visit for families with small children. Its like entering disneyland! You can visit the mini safari world, fun world, and others to name a few. Do check website everland for details."
Fun,"This theme park is similar to Disneyland or Universal Studio (depends on which one you compare it to). Be there early if you wish to spend more time in the park as many attractions close at 1700. Upon arrival, get a pamphlet and mark what you wanna see/ ride. You may not be able to cover all shows/ rides. For instance, half way playing at the 'Magic Land', we had to walk for 10 mins to watch the panda shows. Then, another 10 mins back to where we had left half way. Go on a weekday and good luck! There are parades at different hours, we watched one at 4pm. The fireworks started at 8pm+ and many visitors made their way home after that. We stayed to snap photos and took some rides again (the cable car, and some other rides). I suggest you to eat at odd hours to avoid big crowds, either late lunch or early dinner. At about 8.00pm some food had sold out! and restaurants/ shops start preparing to close at about 8.30pm. We started making our way home when the park was closing at about 9pm."
theme park,Theme park for teens. Inside there are safari park- a mini zoo and some gifts shops. A few rides and 4d theatre.
Romantic Fantasy,"Winter is always a great season to feel romantic. Everland offers you a romantic and peaceful environment to unwind from all the stresses once you walk in. As usual, you need a strong pair of legs to take you too all Everland has to offer and a strong tummy and heart to take on the rollercoaster. For those who seek adventure, this is right up your alley. To the hopeless romantic, fret not for winter has that magic touch waiting to be discovered. If you are hungry, look no further. Just find, the menu you fancy. Finally, you do need a full day for the resort, at the very least. Cheers and enjoy!!!!"
One of the good amusement parks in Asia,"We went there with relatively modest expectations and were positively surprised in the end.It is definitely one of the best parks I visited so far in Asia. It is a big park with a lot of rides.We went there during a cold autumn weekday and it was relatively empty, so we did not had to wait for rides a lot. The wooden roller coaster is one of the best and highest ones in the world. Besides this they have many other fun rides. They also have a zoo safari part, which a lot of families liked it seems. I am generally not a fan of these type of zoos, so I will not add this to my review.They have many restaurants with decent food. When we were there they build up this huge Christmas area with endless amounts of lights, which was very nice and impressive at night.We took the public bus to the park, which was pretty easy and cheap."
theme park like disneyland,"going to this theme park requires quite an effort, from bus, subway and bus again.this theme park has a complete set of play ground, zoo, shops, food and some attraction.like many other theme park it requires a lot of walk inside. but dont worry you can rest in the resting area or have some food from the food / drink stall. it has some special christmas decorations and some parade"
Fantastic time to visit,"Highlight of my recent Seoul trip, at least according to son and nephew. The cons: many of the attractions within were closed either due to renovations or low-season. The pros: low season means few visitors and we actually did not have to queue long for even the T-Express roller-coaster, which was helluva ride. The VR room was fantastic too. Overall, love the fact that I went off-season because we did not waste our time queueing."
The place! Wow amazing park,"So much fun! Little kids love it and adults feel like children again. Huge park! So much fun. For 60,000 you have an amazing time feeling like a little Disney in Korea"
The first trip for me with friends,"It was the first time I go travel with my friends, we chose to go Seoul because we like shopping XD. We had five days trip and we went Everland the second day. I remember that because we went in Summer, so I bought t-shirts and shorts, but because Korea is in temperate zone, the weather isn't too hot and even a little cold, it made me had to buy so new clothes for warm. Although it was happy for me to have a trip with friends, there had something made us having some arguments.Anyway, Everland is the most interest theme park I had gone, I think. The wood roller coaster I love so so much! I play that for three times, but there had so many people so I wasted a lot of time for waiting. If there had a chance for me to travel, I would choose Seoul because I really like it so much."
Wonderful experience,This place is a must visit in South Korea.It is surrounded by beautiful mountains and attractions are never ending .T Express Roller ride is one time life experience.Children will love Animal Safari.
The best amusement park in Korea,"Very good place to spend a time with your family or your friends for one day. There's many attractions for any wants, and the zoo section is really enjoyable for children. Unfortunately, the Caribbean Bay was not opened yet at the time, only for summer months, even if the weather was already warm.However, the park is often crowed, especially during holidays, so be prepared to wait for possibly some hours to do the main attractions.I highly recommend it !"
Autumn tour of South Korea,"Everland was part of the tour package. We were only given 4 hours and it wasn't enough time as queues for some rides takes as long as 1 hour or more even on a week day. Can't imagine what is like on a weekend or public holiday. This place need at least two day to cover all the attractions. Great place for the family but as usual, food is rather pricey as with most theme parks."
amazing and fantastic,"This is amazing and fantastic place. This amusement park is most famous park in Korea as Disney land in USA. You come here, you are satisfy."
Huge theme park for everyone!,"During our time in South Korea, we had to make a choice between going for Lotte World or Everland, due to our limited time schedule. We decided to go for Everland for a few reasons which will be explained later below.There are many ways to get to Everland, the most common and preferred would be by bus 5002 from Gangnam Station in Seoul towards Everland in Yongin. This will usually take 90 minutes under normal traffic conditions. In our case however, being the railfan we are, we choose to take the Seoul Metro and Korail railway train combination. There is a Everline line that is built specifically for the Everland theme park. Of course this means that in the process, we needed to transfer lines a few times and took closer to 2 hours overall. There are yet other ways to get to Everland, but it will not be mentioned here as the list is rather exhaustive.As for the theme park itself, to say that it is big is an understatement. It is so huge that an entire day has to be set aside just for Everland itself. We had initially wanted to visit the Korean Folk Village nearby for half a day first then go to Everland in the second half of the day but we realized there would not be enough time. Be prepared to do a lot of walking and make sure to take the map, which has both English and Korean versions to make sure that you do not get lost easily.Everland has one key difference that stands out from Lotte World, and it is that it has something for everyone, whereas most of the rides and attractions at Lotte World are designed for children. The rides at Lotte World are also a little older compared to Everland, which is always being constantly updated. There are the usual hair-raising rides like the roller-coasters and pirate ship rides for those brave ones with strong hearts, but there is also an animal zoo-like section where you can see South Korea's giant pandas, which were loaned from China, and go on a duck tour and see the various animals safari style. There is even a Disneyland inspired kind of street parade in the afternoon, where performers dance and entertain around in their moving floats. The one thing we liked about Everland was the huge amount of flowers in the theme park itself that will please everyone no matter the age.There are plenty of choices for food, and the prices at their restaurants are surprisingly reasonable. This is definitely a must go when going to South Korea for the first time. You can actually save some time and money on the entrance ticket by either printing coupons online or use the Seoul Pass app, which can save as much as 33% off!"
Beautiful place,"Visited last October 14, 2016Loved all areas of the place. Rides are fun and extreme but prepare for waiting in long lines during peak season. Loved all areas in the theme park as all of theme were picture perfect spots.Will come back to try other rides. "
DIE DIE HAVE TO GO,"It's a theme park which allows all age groups to visit and enjoy! It consists of many ride; (exciting to the kids ones), garden, zoo (safari, lost valley). so it's worth it even if you don't dare to take the rides.You might want to consider buy the Q-Pass for the T-Express as the queue can be quite long (130 mins for the time when I was there)The walk to each ride can take quite a while, but there's chairlift, cable car, travelator to help you with it."
a definite place to go,"definitely worth the entrance fee! Must try the T-express, 70 degree drop is no joke, but queue for 2 hours is too much. Others such as amazon express, safari, 4 season garden, etc are very exciting and well decorated also!Dont miss the parade starting around 8.30-9pm"
Would Have Been Perfect (if it were not for some worrisome exhibits it had),"One day isn't enough to explore the entirety of Everland. At first glance, you'd think that it's just a Disneyland wannabe but it's way more than that! Even without world famous characters and franchises featured in its rides and attractions, Everland surprisingly can hold its own as an amusement park worthy of recognition. It has rides for amusement park goers of all ages: fun and colorful rides for children, musical productions that boast of talent, and exhilarating rides for thrill seekers. A huge chunk of Everland is also dedicated to its animal attractions. Notable attractions include its Panda observatory and its version of a safari ride that rivals the one in Singapore's Night Safari. However, the orangutan and polar bear exhibits were quite ALARMING for me. The orangutan is restricted to a steel tower where it's forced to do tricks. It doesn't seem to have adequate space to roam around; thus is subjected to an entire day posing for its audiences under the scorching heat of the sun. The polar bear exhibit wasn't even in a frozen area. The uneasiness of the animal was evident as it kept rolling its body in the water to cool itself in such a warm and dry environment. If Singapore was able to recreate the appropriate environment essential to its flora attractions in the Flower Dome; the same should be done for the animals here."
Good varieties of things for all ages,We knew there were going to be queues but if I knew better I would've booked out the main rollercoaster/thrill rides as the queues were all at least 90mins/2hrs long. You would probably need about 5 hrs to walk around to all the park as there is also a zoo inside. There's beautiful flowers and great range of rides for all ages. We took a bus to get here and back and honestly from roughly 11 - 6pm you couldn't cover all of what you wanted. Highlights were the Halloween themed attractions throughout the park. Horror Maze was great but you had to pay for that. Loved the Halloween decorations throughout the venue
Theme park,"If you like, try wooden roller coaster called t express and the horror maze. Lots of food stalls, restaurants and cafes, also toilets."
Good Mixed of Activities,"This place requires a full day to be able to enjoy. Was there on a Sunday and the place was packed. There's full of rides, shows, birds, animals, safari, food, shops, etc. But don't expect a full zoo or safari as it just compliments this theme park. So u enjoy a little of everything. I missed the century garden as I was told it was very good for photography, maybe next time."
Large play ground,You need more 1 day to walking around everland. Soooo huge amusement. And dont forget to seeing giant panda. The location near exit escalator (to main gate)
"90s setting, not worth the time","i have high hopes for everland, but was so disappointed after that. luckily we took a shuttle bus to reach the place (abt 1hr journey). not worth to spend the time to travel all the way here. the rides are old and run down, it is like a 90s theme park. uncomparable with tokyo disneyland or usj at all! i think that is why the ticket is so much cheaper! my recommendation is to skip this and do something else in seoul. "
Not enough...,"A 5-hour-visit is not enough to try all the rides. If you are just aiming for a walk, it is enough o explore the whole theme park. To try the main attractions, you have to queue and the waiting time might be more than 2 hours. Anyway, I did enjoy my time here. There are also shows starting at 12.30 pm onwards. Since I visited Everland in mid October, the Halloween decos are everywhere. No halal restaurants here so to Muslims, you mighy need to pack your own meal. There's also surau here."
One of best amusement park in Korea,"It is good to go there. Many people go there with their family, couple or friends. They have many ride equipment. The T-express is one of famous rides in there."
"Not worth it, stay in seoul! ","Not worth the time or money. Stay and enjoy amazing Seoul instead. Everland is ok, the attractions are mostly for parents with little kids. Its also very old and not worth the travel.Please go somewhere else don't waste your time like I did. "
Must visit!,"If you love flowers, animals and awesome rides this place is a must visit! It's also awesome for any ages as they have something no matter how old you are. And! You have to try the fastest wood roller coaster in Asia which is found here. Also don't forget to pay the Pandas a visit. It's a really cool place. "
Best Asia Theme Park Ever!,"I would say this is Best theme park in Asia. This Park is beautiful, big & come with lots of attraction & restaurant. Very nice place to spend for a day even for someone like me who are not a fan of extremes games.Must visit their safari rides (although they only speak in korean but you will still enjoy the tour) & do not miss Everland night parade & Fireworks. Four seasons garden is stunning beautiful in day or night.I will come back again if I visit Korea again!"
Best zoo and amusement park ever!!!,I've been to many zoos but this is the absolute best! There are so many varieties of animals and not just one or two but ten to twenty of each species. We saw pandas white tigers rare monkeys just to name a few. The animals roam about and many walk right up to the tram. Also there is a giant roller coaster rapids ride and many other thrilling rides plus a variety of variety of restaurants. The grounds are clean and gorgeous. Can't wait to return
Best Theme Park in Korea,"This is the best theme park in Korea.Everland is a very huge complex, 90 minutes from Seoul and have a lot green scenery inside.They have lot of attractions for any kind of ages, from kids to teenager to adult.Personally I like Amazon Express, Lost Valley, Pororo 3D Adventure, Space Tour, Racing Coaster, Dragon Coaster, Rotating House and Mystery Tour.But the highlight of this theme park should be T-Express (the wooden roller coaster, top speed : 104 km/h) and Lost Valley (animal kingdom safari).And also don't miss light parade, around 9 pm.The downside of the this park is lack of character that everybody knows. That lower down the spirit a little bit, especially for kids. And they also lack a good craft theme building / construction. Direction to this attraction : go to Gangnam station (exit no 10), walk 300 m and take bus 5002 (in front of Who.A.U store) for about 90 minutes, and take a free shuttle bus to Everland.Instagram : @adjimantoro"
Visit during off-peak season!,"I've visited there around end of July this year, and since it was off-peak season, there isn't any long lines! Even the T-express (wooden roller coaster which is a really popular ride), we only have to wait 10 minutes. Highly recommend travellers to visit during off-peak season so you can enjoy more games and stuff!"
Just a normal theme park,"Since i'm not a fan of theme park and extreme games such as roller coaster so i'm not really going to this place for the second time again. Went there on May and a lot of people also went there because it was a national holiday in Korea, so i need to queued for a long time and it's almost hard to see the ground from the cable car because there were so many many people.You can find many line's characters and take a photos there. Also they have some kind of carnival or parade."
Highlight of my trip,"Took me quite a while to decide to either go Everland or Lotte World. Initially I wanted to go both but itinerary and vitamin M does not permit haha. After much research, Everland it is as Lotte World seems to be more for kids. And what can i say, no regrets at all! Everland is huge so one full day is necessary. I had such a good time here! The must visits here are the Zootopia area - hope on the 2 animal sighting rides! one of them is a bus and another is a bus-boat! The thrill is amazing. Another ride that has to be taken is Amazon Express and yes this is a water ride. After some research, i realise this ride will really get u wet! So i brought my own poncho not wanting to pay for expensive poncho at the amusement park! But Hey! the ride has changed. They have a body wrap on the seat which covers u from neck to toe! haha so off go the poncho! thats really considerate of the ride. However, you will still get slightly wet but thats the fun right! Ok, i leave a full paragraph for the highlight ride of Everland. And thats T-Express. Heard it packs one of the highest vertical drop and boy it sure does! I have sat many rollercoaster and this has to be the best of them all. With a real deep drop which makes you feel like flying off your seat, coupled with at least close to 10 other smaller plunges! usually rollercoaster only has 2-4 plunges but this is nearly 10!! the excitement is neverending! A point to note : not for the faint hearted as it is quite intense i assure you.. Nonetheless, the bad thing about everland is its too crowded. most of my rides i had to queue close to an hour, so much time wasteddd...zzzzz... another problem is everland is not easily accessible, i urge you to book a day tour which provides bus to transport you! but theres one drawdown of this as most day tour in fact all of them, fetches you back around 6+, which means one have to skip the everland fireworks at 8-830pm.. This was my biggest dilemma but upon researching how to go everland on my own, i gave up the fireworks ahahaha.. Too much work my friend..Other point to know, as everland is HUGE, lots of walking is for sure.. Theres an area call the magic land, though the rides are for kids, the place is really insanely gorgeous, like its animated off a fairy tale.. must visit just to take pics!Hope this helps.."
Good theme park with diversified attractions,"Korean Disneyland Park with good theme parks. As it was raining, we have not experienced the wooden roller coaster (closed). We have enjoyed the safari ride, with close encounters with tigers, lions, bears, giraffes..."
Fun Times,Lots of fun rides. The wooden roller coaster is the main draw. There are pretty gardens as well if you're tired of walking. The decorations/ themes of some of the rides look rather outdated but the rides still seem fun and well-maintained. 
Good themepark,"Good themepark in a pretty location surrounded by trees and nice gardens. We took the train from Suwon city hall and it took about 40mins. I think it will always be busy, we were there on a Wednesday during school term but it was still busy. We didn't get any QPasses as we couldn't work it out. If you are there early in the morning it might be worth trying to work out how they work. They release another lot for the T-express but you need to line up at a special window at 2pm. The Horror Maze (extra charge, just for Halloween) was incredibly scary and is highly recommended. We got a small discount for showing our flight details but others talked about more, again try to figure it out before you arrive."
Fun First Day,"Everland has lots of massively, long rides and scary attractions.I recommend you to go there because it is a great way to spend the day. We enjoyed the shops and restaurants as well."
T Express is a must try/dont go during holiday,"We went there during cheusok day? I tthink itss the korean holiday. There are lots of people so the lines are pretty long. I wish we scheduled our trip some other time. But anyway, it was really great. I love the rides there because they are more challenging and can be enjoyed by the youth. My top favorites are the T express which i lined up for 3hours and the safari tour where we lined up for 2.5hrs. Super wild but definitely worth it! I also enjoyed the parade though its still incomparable to disneyland/disneysea. "
Everland - a themepark for both kids and adults,"Everland is a place whereby its suitable for both kids and adults (always remember to check their website for discounts as I got 50% off my ticket) - there is also a FREE shuttle bus to Everland. Everland is an outdoor themepark and hence, I recommend you check the weather first before going. Notable rides are their Safari rides whereby you can get a personal tour whereby tigers can jump on your jeep (or opt in for the bus tour). For the adventurous aka YOLO people, try T-express ride - the 1st wooden, 4th steepest , 9th fastest, 4th tallest, and 6th longest wooden coaster :) The queue might be long at times but the ride is something to be remembered. Stay for their night fireworks 9PM if you can."
Hugh Theme Park,"It took us 2 hours+ from Myeongdong to Everland Theme Park by train. Please be early to set off in the morning. It opens from 9:30-10pm. The fireworks starts at 9:30pm in the evening. Seoul Subway/train services close around mid-night (I.e 12:00), so please estimate your train return schedule before you decide whether should stay for the fireworks & the evening lighting cars parade. "
So amazing,"This park has so many adventure game, changes follow 4 seasons in the year. So great with the families have teenages or children..."
Wonderful ,"For Foreigners, show the ticket office your international flight ticket or boarding pass, and get 30% discount. It is much interesting for parents with their kids. A lot of things for kids. I like the rollercoaster at the european adventurer park, and Panda. Ever Land is very big park and you can't cover all of it. Caribbean Bay (Water Park) located Next to Ever land. "
Worst customer service experience ever at Everland,During the Korean chuseok holiday everland offers cheap entrance for foreigners. However they may not have let all the staff know that they would be welcoming foreigners. Especially the staff at the safari were barking orders in Korean to obvious foreigners who could speak Korean. They kept going even when told that no one could understand. Miss Kim especially needs to be taken for a few days of customer service training. Don't expect good customer service just because they invited you to visit during the holiday for a cheaper price. 
Nice place to be in,We are a large family spend a whole day in everland. The kids enjoyed the games. The food is real good. We also enjoyed the shows. There are different games for all type of ages. Don't ever miss it if you are in Seoul. 
Great for kids!,"We were a group of about 50 people (mostly kids) who spent a whole day at the park. I ventured onto a couple rides, but wasn't really interested in most. The kids in our group loved the roller coaster the best. Unfortunately many of the rides were closed. There was a parade during the day that was different to any I've seen before - they had big hoses and would spray people! That was fun. All the gift shops I visited seemed to be geared toward very young children. Many of the food stalls were also closed. Our group of 50ish stayed at the resort overnight. No one slept well. Thin mattresses on a floor are not at all comfortable for adults. Not so bad for kids - but less than pleasant for adults. I was one of two lucky adults who had a bed - a regular sized mattress on the floor. (I had knee surgery and can't get onto the floor), but even that was hard enough and somewhat comfortable."
Wonderful place!,"I prefer Everland than Hongkong Disneyland mainly because Everland is bigger and have more interesting activities apart from the fun rides. The main highlight is Zootopia and the Hologram theatre. In Zootopia itself, there is safari ride, feeding animals etc. Really fun and affordable. Great for solo travellers too as you can choose where to go and what to do at your own timing! Advisable to arrange shuttle bus to your accomodation as the location is far. At the end of the day, you will be exhausted so it is best to arrange your own transport back to your accomodation than having to travel via public transport. However, you will have to leave earlier around 6pm. "
amazing at reasonable cost,we and my childrend fully enjoyed the trip starting from around 2pm till 9pm which was quite enough as no much crowd during weekday. T Express ride was one of the best I have seen. there are also few other rides for adults and so many for children. the moonlight parade was very nice and fireworks was outstanding and worth waiting till end of the day to see it or come in the afternoon as we did. I highly recommend it.
One of the huge theme park ~,Oh this theme park is huge that you will have to sit on the cable car and travel to diff parts no doubt walking is fine. If you really wanna play and q for all the rides and sightseeing i guess needs 2 days. It even have a zoo in the park with the Pandas. The entertainment show was nice but well in korean so we dont really understand ~
The Best theme park in Korea!,"If you only planned one day to visit the theme park during your trip in Korea, you should go to Everland. It is a park suitable for family travel with kids, couple travel or even friendship travel. Because it is big enough to supply different level of activity to fit different age groups of the visitor. You could visit the zoo area with different kinds of animals, you could play the big wooden roller coaster, you could even just have a walk with many beautiful flowers around the garden, as i went there with my wife on March."
Fun big theme park with zoo in it! ,"Fun theme park that's bigger than it looks. Part of it is a zoo! Really enjoyed the zoo safari rides. Half day visit is not enough. Long queues for popular rides. Note: It's built in a hill area and in the middle of the park is a (slight) hill, so you either have to walk down from entrance to the rest of the park or up to entrance when you want to leave, or take the ski lift which usually have a queue so need to make extra time especially when you're leaving. "
Best theme park in Korea!,"Everland is such a wonderful place! It's even in comparison to disney! They have a lot of amazing rides! The food inside are relatively cheap, they also have a transport service to bring you from the bus stop to the inner entrance of the park, you need to take a bus going to the park from gangnam station for about 40 to 50 minutes."
Everland on winter,"Everland is one of the biggest outdoor theme park in South Korea and home to the very famous wooden rollercoaster the--T-Express. Since it is outdoor, in can be very cold during the winter season and few of the attractions are close, probably because of the weather itself. But, all in all Everland is a must visit place in South Korea! :)"
Fun day out!,"Spent 1 whole day at Everland and I absolutely enjoyed the safari tour and the T-express ride the best! The talented bears that knew how to do tricks really made the tour such an entertaining one. This is definitely a place for everyone, young and old!"
Best Theme Park,I love this place with about 50 dollar u can go here. Love the weather. Must go to this place if u go to korea
Fun and exciting,"Suitable for family with young children, the most exciting mobile game is T-express. Its a lot of fun and night parade. When you go to Everland by public transport, you can go to Gangnam station then take a red bus 5002 around 50min. Friend remind if you back to down town like Myeong-dong, please make sure you can back before 11:30pm to take metro because it will closed at 12:00 mid night, 15min before, passanger can't enter to the metro."
awesome day out,"was on a tour with work group, did not know what to expect, well the roller coaster was one of the fastest and thrilling i have been on, differently a place to bring kids as well, many shows to entertain and rides including a zoo, well worth the trip"
fun,good place to find different kind of activities. there are roller coasters and water shows in summer and tours in the Safari and animal shows
Joy,This place is amazing and you will spend a fun time there but just choose a good day to go don't ever go in weekend or Thursday try to go in a weekdays to avoid the long waiting time and check the weather try not to go in a hot summer days. Don't miss the T express. There is a safari there as well.
Fabulous and amazing!!!,"Guys if you are near to seoul you have to visit Everland .. Amazing place and you will have fun on this place for all ages .. Don't miss to ride "" T Express "" .. It's the best game over there and it's worth to wait for it.. About the tickets, you don't have to spent more money on "" Q pass"" ticket because the maximum time we have waiting for one game is 50 minutes so the regular ticket will be OK for you if you visit the park early.. Have fun !!"
Fun!,"Good place to have fun, seeing animals such as penguins and polar bear, experience the T-express and water splash show during summer to reduce the heat! "
One of the BEST places to visit in Korea,Everland is one of the BEST places to visit in Korea. Its an amzing park with lots of scary rides and adventures.
""" wonderful everland ""","Indeed a wonderful place for everyone, colorful flower gardens, awesome rides, and a lot more to see in this place highly recommended for the whole family and the ticket is very affordable as well;)"
fantastic summer splash,Everland's summer splash :Never seen before.. it's worthed... European area :- the beautiful garden - Delicious chicken roasted at garden terace restaurant
Great park,"We enjoyed all the rides we could. Went during the week and longest lines were 20 min wait. We were disappointed the Ferris wheel and a few other rides were closed. The staff was friendly, food was good and the park was clean. "
Awful and cruel!,There were a few decent rides (the T express roller coaster was pretty good) but otherwise the attraction themselves were pretty average. The thing that upset me most was the zoo within the park. So unbelievably cruel! There was a baby orangutan alone in basically a shop window. Ridiculous amounts of animals crammed into small spaces. It was disturbing to say the least. Don't go if you're not a fan of animal cruelty....
Great time here in everland,We all enjoyed the big park.. everland staff they are so kind and there smile always. We came here Thursday it wasn't busy and you can ride any game often.. 
Fun & Exciting,"You r never too old for amusement park ^^ i enjoyed everything here even it's raining (sad for 5 seconds). Among a few rides i enjoyed T-Express, koea 1st wooden coaster, the 4th wooden coaster with prefabricated track, the 1st ride of its type in Asia. Sound fun rite!!! Not reckon for too young kids & seniors. By the way, there is a big line store here too (if u r a fan). "
Come away from Everland happily ‘Ever’ after,"My family and I spent a wonderful sunny day at this large amusement theme park, which caters to the young, the young at heart and the old.Getting there and admission: We book the Everland package through Funko Fantastic at discounted 42,000 won which includes shuttle bus to and fro Everland and Myeongdong (pickup 9:30am and 6:30pm) and entrance ticket. Because the pickup is 6:30pm, we had to miss the parade and the fireworks. To see both, then you either rent a car or stay in a nearby accommodation. The Attraction: I recommend going there on a weekday, like we did, since there isn’t much of a crowd. I also recommend going on a day where there's no rain since most of the rides are in the openYou should give yourself about 8 hours, which allows you to complete all the rides. Moreover, the waiting time for the rides will be shorter. We waited for as short as 10 minutes for most rides while the longest is 30 minutes for the hugely popular T-express roller coaster.Speaking of roller coaster rides, I have ridden all 3 – Racing Coaster, Rolling X-Train and T-Express. The T-Express – structure built on wood and has the steepest falling degree of 77 degrees in the world – wins hands down in terms of thrill and excitement. And we got stiff neck after the ride because of the sheer force of the “wind” and inertia that pushes your head backwards! The X-Train with two 360 degrees rotation and a corkscrew is only about 1 minute long, which is kind of anti-climax for me. The wet rides are just as fun – the rafting adventured Thunder Falls and the Amazon Express. It would be good to bring your own poncho or buy one for the Thunder Falls, unless you want to get wet as part of the fun. For the Amazon Express, each vessel (round “boat”) has the covering to cover your body. Like we did, you could take the cable car (Sky Cruise) and the chair lift (Sky Way) to get from one place (Adventure) to another faster. As for food, there are several restaurants and stalls in the park, so you could never go hungry. I recommend to ride the roller coasters first before having a heavy meal.If you have young kids less than 10 years old, not to worry because there is a “zoo” section in Everland (polar bear, lion etc) plus rides for kids. If you enjoy flowers, there’s also a display of seasonal flowers in red, yellow, indigo, pink, orange in front of the Oriental Restaurant.So it’s been an enjoyable day out for my family and I, and we left Everland with fond memories of the rides and how efficient and how well it is run and maintained – we did not experience any technical breakdown in all the rides."
Visti with a baby,"We arrived at the Everland around 5pm. We went down to animal place via cable car. There are two kinds of bus tour for Safari(zoo). One for the herbivore and the other for the carnivore. We also took Amazon Express, little boat tour going through rapid stream. It was fun to get wet a little bit."
Must-visit theme park!,"Make sure you check the weather forecast beforehand. A rainy day will cause many outdoor rides to be closed. Try to avoid weekends as well. Be prepared for a lot of walking, give it one day to finish most of the sights. The T-express roller coaster is not to be missed! The food is surprisinfly good. There is a parade show every hour. Catch the panda and the Liger zoo. Bring a decent camera for the gardens. Bring an extra set of clothes for when you get uncomfortably sweaty. Enjoy!"
A Must Go Theme Park in Korea!,"Very unique and fun theme park with the combination of zoo and rides and more!!! We really enjoyed all the rides and shows! Strongly recommended to go during weekdays as the queue was not so long! As for a family with kids and old folk, it would be better to take a cab as the travelling could be quite tedious and time-consuming. Check out the online promo where you can save more instead of buying on the spot!"
A reminder of Childhood,"This is a fantastic Korean amusement park built by the Samsung Cooperation. There is a combination of Safari and flower gardens and shopping areas and a wide variety of outdoors and indoors roller coasters and other types of activities - suitable for all types of ages from 4+. A wonderful place. However, it's easy for people to get lost because the area was so large and the signs so confusing!"
Great roller coaster,"The park is fairly large with a great variety of things to do. For me the roller coaster, T express, was the highlight and visiting the pandas. The safari world was a also interesting and you can get some great photos. The bus trip was a bit long but cheap. It was enjoyable as a couple but families will have more to do."
Having so much fun here!,"Everland located outside Seoul. It took me 6 transits of subway(aroung 2 hours) to get to the Jeondae Everline station. But it was worth it. I love the view. Everland is surrounded by trees, hills, green is everywhere :) It was Tuesday and there were many students. Maybe they're on their school trip. My first ride was Rolling X-Train, took me 40 minutes of queueing. Quite entertaining. But the best attraction here is T-Express. That high wooden roller coaster. The queue was very long, took me almost an hour to wait in line but it was worth it. I wanna ride it again if i come here again. I had jajangmyeon at chinese restaurant inside everland, and it's delicious. There were free mineral water too. Snacks and ice cream stands are everywhere too. So don't worry about hungry stomach. Everland also has such a big and beautiful flower garden. In spring, they exhibit roses. There were a lot of photo spots in which you could take many beautiful pictures for hours. For the ticket, it is cheaper if you buy it online. I bought it for only 36000won at funtastickorea.Ah, you can also see real panda here. They are very cute :)"
DoD,Awesome! Didn't wait in line for the rides too long. The longest I waited was about 20min. The wooden rollercoaster was the best!
Better for younger families,"The wooden roller coaster, which is the star attraction, was awesome! The other rides would probably not be very exciting for older children/adults as they were mostly those you see at every park or more suitable for the little ones. Everland is very picturesque, with lots of fairytale themed structures and set as it is in the mountains. The facilities are excellent, with easy access to food, toilets, rest areas, etc. And the gift shops were a lot of fun, with a great selection of products, all very reasonably priced and very attractive."
Enjoyable trip to Everland,"The theme park is beautiful, especially the flower garden. There are rides for young children and adult. Staff are friendly and professional. They dance and sing to the music played. We managed to cover most of the places with our 8 year old girl in a day. (10am to 6pm)I would like to visit again in autumn."
Everland Theme Park,"I visited Everland Theme Park on the first day of my stay in Seoul. I rode the Gangnam Bus # 5002 to Everland , took a taxicab from the hotel to go to the Bus stop. When I arrived at the Everland Theme Park, it was raining very hard & it was very windy as well . I was surprised to see so many people are still going to the park inspite of the wet & windy weather condition. After about 40 min., the rain stopped. I was able to go around the park to take photos. There were nice gardens full of lovely flowers of many different colors & variety. There was a huge , very tall decorated tree few yards away from the Park entrance. And by the front inside the park entrance, there was a decor in a round area surrounded with flowers that said 40th Anniversary. There were plastic made huge butterfly decorations in many different colors , hanging on poles, that lined the sidewalks. Very colorful.There were artistic bldgs scattered all around the park. Because of the wet weather condition I did not stay long, that's why I only rated it 4 stars. May be if it was a beautiful sun shiny day it would have been better. Well, I happen to be there when Spring showers is common, I never thought it would rain that day."
A fun day out,"I have to admit this wasn't the best amusement park in the world but it was pretty good for a family day out. There were two big top rollercoasters, T-express and rolling x-train which unfornately I wasn't able to go on because there was a 90 min wait. So I would highly recommend to get the Q-pass or go to the park as early as possible. The two big rollercoasters are pretty much right at the very end of the park, so it's a bit of a walk to get to it. Zootopia was great... it took us half the morning to go round, it was a really big area and so much to see and do. At the entrance of the Lost Valley is a lounge, where they offered free drinks like hot chocolate, coffee, tea and other refreshments, which totally surprised us. Plantopia was beautiful, the flowers designs were spectacular. There something here for everyone and is brilliant for families with young children.To get to Everland - We took the Seoul subway line 2 to Gangnam Station, took exit 10 and walked straight to get to the first bus stop (directly in front of WHOAU shop), when we arrived there was already a queue and there was an old man helping everyone to get the right bus, he was really good... the bus number for Everland is 5002 and fare was 2,100 won, it does have a few stops on the way to Everland and it took about 40 minutes. Once arrived, there's a free shuttle bus that takes everyone from the bus stop to the park entrance."
Best place ever,"Fun and very spacious. Check out their website for deals. For us, there's a shuttle and entry package for 47kwon (adult). Waited at myeongdong exit 2 for the bus and then it's straight to everland. Return is at 6:30pm and drop off at myeongdong (just in time for dinner). Our favourite is the Super Flume ride - exciting yet will not let you spill your heart out! Overall it's much better than Lotte world (except for the aircon)."
CHURROS @ AMERICAN ADVENTURE,"We were lucky that the weather did not trick us and stayed bright through out, thus we were able to enjoy heartily. The zoo was amazing, I've never been so close to a giraffe like its face was right in front of me chewing its snacks (grass)! Other animals encounter were also cool, with the bus moving among the kings of animals while we maintained in a bus. The wooden roller coaster was also incredible even though the queue was too much(queued 1hr 40mins) but was still faster than what we were told. Its a pity we didn't have the time to enjoy the rides in American Adventure, but we were so so so glad we tasted the churros there! Having tasted some churros around Singapore, this is one of the best i've ever tasted! So if you ever get to American Adventure, please please queue for them! Its right in front of one of the scariest ride in A.A theme (the one that roll & roll haha) The main reason we did not manage to play is because we were rushing to get a spot to watch the fireworks. There were also performances to watch, which gave no excuse for my dying phone to rest well in my bag. For those who are travelling on low budget, rest assured that there will be shuttle bus out of Everland even after watching the fireworks, and from there you will have to change to public bus to the train station."
Not that fantastic...,"Heard so much about the place, was somehow disappointed when visited...We booked via website for Everland, they offered discounted tickets including 2-way transport, priced at 45000 won, quite a good deal...We met at Hongyik station, exit 4, at 9am for the bus pickup, the bus pick few more people along the way... We reached Everland around 1030 am... If you take via train, it will probably take 2 hours, if starts from Hongyik University station...The space is big, a lot of walking between rides... Most of the rides were rather old and no much queue needed... One of the crowd favorites was he T-Express, didn't try, but those who tried felt it was a great experience... Other than T-Express, the rat of the rides were rather gentle and mild...I will not strongly recommend the place, unless you really have time in Korea to spend a day in an amusement park or wanting to have an experience of T-Express..."
LOVED IT!,"This theme park doesn't only offer rides but also has a zoo in it! Some rides are a little bit more extreme than others but there are also choices for the children. If you're on the adventurous side, make sure to try T Express!! The queue is quite long, but it's very much worth the wait!"
More for the kids than the adults,We went during the Halloween and they have great makeup artists for zombiefied look for a fee. Place is huge and interesting. Be aware of the korean kids who jump queues and all. Make sure to check the weather forecast before going. It wasn't fun if it rains.
Great for a day,"A fun theme park. Highlights are the safari and top roller coaster. Many of the rides are a little childish but overall, the park is very entertaining. The food is generally not good. There is a fast pass available which can save you hours of waiting on line."
Amazing ,"This place is a beautiful amusement park, different attractions for different ages and likes, be prepared to walk a lot and patience for big lines. It is very important if you want to skip this big lines is to buy the Q-Pass (more expensive but worthy).One day visit is not enough!"
Interesting & fun,"Just like any other theme parks, but one that stands out is the safari. Cable car, roller coaster, water ride & shows are among a few that will attract all. Place is very clean, food outlets easily available & staffs are friendly. To cover all, U will need to spend a day in the park."
Such a great place!!!,"My wife, daughters and I had such a great time at Everland. It is spotlessly clean, well run and massive ... it's so big that even though there are a lot of people, you never really get the sense that the place is overly crowded. There are many 'worlds' to visit and one activity that I want to highlight is the private safari where you get to go on a specially-reinforced 4WD vehicle to feed raw chicken meat to lions, tigers and bears using tongs! These animals' massive jaws are literally 20cm from your face!!!"
It's a fun outing,"We didn't decide to go Everland till we arrived here in Seoul. Partly it was the influence of our friends who came a few days earlier than us. We enjoyed our time there. The attractions were well maintained. Of particular note, we enjoyed the Safari World and the animal performances. We missed the initial part of the Birds in Flight but it was amazing when we caught the end part. If you love animals, Zootopia will take up a huge part of your time there. The parade was interesting with a dazzling display of lights, colour and costumes. We did however miss the fireworks which was a real bummer. The reason we missed it was it was placed too near the closing time. Hence we were concerned we will not make the trip back to Seoul in time. Food and drinks were reasonably priced. There was not much of a hike up which is highly commendable. The real downside is our perceived lack of good public transportation. We changed 2 lines to reach the bus stop. The bus was so full we had to stand and the last leg of the journey up was very nauseating as the driver of the bus sped and swerved the corners of the hill as we journeyed up. Hence for our return journey, we took the subway back which maybe much longer but I am sure less nauseating. It would be great to have a proper decent public transport like an proper express Bus which doesn't need to be prebooked. "
Great family place,"Great place to go with your family, not super friendly for tall people or larger people but still enough to do."
fun and good scenery,this amusement park has many rides but i think it is very good too for photosesion because they change the decoration every season.
Fun! ,"This theme park features the T-express, touted as a must visit in Seoul. The park had varying rides and attractions for different taste and was clean. Staff were friendly and very helpful and added to the magical atmosphere of the place. It is some distance from Seoul but the rides were worth the visit. "
Going to see the Pandas,"Very nice day trip, the zoo is worth seeing especially the pandas and the monkeys. A lot of street food to be had except a little on the pricey side. If you have ever been to Disney you probably wont find this that all exciting. Always packed and the lines are long, usually a 20+ minute wait."
Great day out for the family,"Visited during Spring ( May '16) , flowers aplenty.Couldn't complete all the attractions though spent a full day here.T-Express not for the faint hearted, exhilirating ride!Panda enclosure is their latest attraction ( got to climb up a fairly steep hill ).Overall great day out for the family."
Open Concept Zoo,"Like the open concept zoo where the bears, tigers, lions, giraffes roam freely. Enjoy seeing these animals coming so near to our bus, especially the giraffes where they put their heads into the bus for food, giving us a chance to get real up close to them."
Everland Theme Park,"Going here during winter is a bit hard due to the cold weather but it is a great theme park. They have a lot of rides, a zoo, shops and restaurants. They also offer discounts for foreigners and can be found in their website. The discount depends on the season as far as I know. But still, it is a place to visit when in South Korea. Don't miss this one!"
Food issue,Can we bring in our own food in everland? Last time i went to HK disneyland we have to throw away our food. Cause its hard for us muslim eat w/o halal food.
Fun and beautiful Everland,"Best time to visit this theme park is during spring, the air was so good, not too hot and cold, the flowers were blooming beautifully. The queue for attraction was very long, took the wrong time to visit on weekend, there were many students and local people. Took minimum half hour for less attractive one (4D cinema) and even 1 hour to 2 hours for famous one (safari, T express). Should really spend 1 day to explore Everland and definitely on weekdays."
Nice but average at times,"Everland offers many themes that change during the year making it possible to experience multiple feelings about the park. It's very spacious and offers great amusement for families with children. However as with most theme parks expect to wait for rides and get souvenir shops at each exit often having noting to do with the ride.There is a good variety of food and stalls around the park and many shops on exit including fashion shops for some reason. (I felt this very unnecessary)I don't think this is exactly the place for amusement park seekers as many rides offer average thrills that could be obtained from the local fair.For couples you can enjoy a ride or 2 eat a nice meal and take photos in the gardens. For families you can enjoy many rides focused around children's entertainment and let them explore the small village inside the park like their own theme park.For adults...If your looking for big thrills you will be disappointed. But if you enjoy a bit of variety and some time out of your day it's worth visiting. The fireworks at night are spectacular and the day and night parades are amazing (unless they are celebrating some anniversary or event, then they scrap the incredible parade for a mediocre tribute one...serious disappointment when this happens)All in all, it's a great park for children and suits the theme of korean photo culture."
Magical,"The rides were amazing and the place was so beautiful in the evening. Even if it was snowing lightly, we were able to enjoy our time here."
"Highlights for toddlers - Lost Valley, Thomas, Taiyo, many kiddie rides and beautiful tulip garden in spring","I had not heard of this themepark until I was in Seoul. Having been to Disneyland in both Hong Kong and Tokyo, I dare to say Everland is much better for its attractions, food and shorter queues.I went with a very demanding 3 year old who was not tall enough for many rides but there was so kiddie attractions to fill up the day. The highlight was of course Lost Valley safari. We had an awesome time looking at the animal enclosures while queuing for the safari ride and we saw giraffes, zebras, goats, cheetahs and elephants in the 10 minute ride over land and water. The highlight was watching the giraffes get fed by the ranger from the windows of the safari bus!We enjoyed the Thomas the train rides, Taiyo bus experience and the many kiddie car / aeroplane rides clustered at the top of the hill.We also saw the tail-end of spring blossoms and the tulip exhibition was really colourful and beautiful.Will be back."
Fun,"If one want to try out something difference from Disneyland, well this is the place. You can spend the whole day enjoying yourself, but avoid going during weekend, public holidays or the country school break. A weekday will be best as lesser crowd."
Dream trip,"Everland is like a disneyland, you have to spend the whole day there and enjoy all the rides. We were able to avail a discount just bring your boarding pass. It seems like you are in another place, very nice and relaxing"
Rekindling being kid at heart,"Everland is a juxtaposition of nature and modernity. It's really overwhelming to come there during springtime, for there are a lot (A LOT) of tulips and other flowers and plants that really are a sight to behold! It's a place that you will NEVER forget forEVER! Though I got scared of the roller coaster ride (I know, pooper, right?), I enjoyed most of the activities like having encounters with animals in both the bus and the amphibious vehicle rides! This theme park is both friendly for the kids and kids at heart. Tip: If you're living in guesthouses (but not all) like that of Kimchee Sinchon Guesthouse, you can avail the ticket at 37,000 KRW, and you don't need to be in the long queue just for you to get the ticket!Of course, don't imitate me by not trying the roller coaster ride! Enjoy that heart-skipping ride!"
Oh dear.......,"If you believe in parallel universes then Everland exists in one. If you are expecting a Disneyland, Warner Bros Movie World, SeaWorld or similar experience, then Everland is not for you. If you are a conservationist or have naturalistic tendencies, then Everland land is not for you. If you want many thrills, chills and adrenaline pumping rides then Everland is not for you. If you're into K-Pop, Gangnam, or are under 12yrs, then Everland is for you. Word-to-the-wise for those around six feet tall, beware very short leg length on rides......some rides will involve some painful origami positions and some won't even let you get in. After waiting an hour to get on the most popular ride......you may not fit! Oh, and if your wanting to buy a soft toy of one (or both) of the Everland mascots that feature prominently on advertising material, programs and in the Grand Parade, forget it....Everland doesn't sell them. Buy a cute Panda instead."
Unexpected amazing experience at this amusement park,"When I arrived there in the morning, we were disappointed cos most of the rides were closed due to the weather. To kill time, we took many pics (since this place is magically wonderful) & ride indoor activities. We were happily surprised when we rode Lost Valley & went to zoo section. There were many exotic animals like polar bear, penguin, etc...perfect to take your little loved ones to introduce them to varied animals. All of the rides operated again in the evening. Since that time was celebration week of 40th Anniversary of Everland, we got another big surprise! at 8 pm, we watched wonderful light parade and a bunch of dancers wearing light costumes. To top it off, we watched an amazing fireworks show at 9 pm. I never saw that kind of fireworks live, so we were very lucky :) If I go to Seoul again, I def will go to Everland again!"
Enjoyed our visit,Had a great time. Its probably better to go on a weekday. The lines were very long. Each ride had at least a 1 hour wait time. The animal exhibits were amazing!
Allocate full day tour for this,"initially I didn’t thing the park is so big but after I got there I couldn’t imagine how many things we can do inside. Start from zoo, parade, performance etc. it will be great time if you bring kids since it looked variation stuffs well exist!"
A great themepark but watch out for the weather!,"Everland is a huge themepark. However, it is very important to note the rides in this themepark are extremely weather sensitive. I was there on a windy but sunny day, and they closed pretty much ALL the exciting rides. That's right. All roller coasters were closed. One of the wet rides was closed. Ferris wheel was closed. Close to 60% of their rides were closed. Even though it was a sunny day! I could understand closing the roller coaster rides, but some of the rides, such as a tiny kids mini coaster ride was closed! Pretty much all the outdoor rides were closed. So gentle rides,such as the carousel had a 50min waiting line! It was just disappointing. I checked their website and found that they will close outdoor rides if there is rain, strong winds, low temperatures. At the end of the day, i'll say visit Everland on a day when it is sunny, and not windy. It's your best bet to get on any rides."
Fun,pros: the amusement park was too big. zoo + park + amusement park all in one. the rides were good. price was good. prepare for long walk. it could be tiring but still fun. cons: i don't recommend it for older people and those who couldn't do long walk. you need to ride bus to get there. it was a long ride. all day activity.
Had a blast,Best part was the wooden rollercoaster. Probably the fuunest ride I have got to ride. Get there early and go straight there the lines get long as the day goes on.
A day wasted at Everland,"We went for the T-Express, but it's was closed due to weather condition and it's not operated even till the time we left at 6.30pm, it wasn't raining and it was a sunny day, we couldn't understand why it's closed as they only use korean in the park. This wasn't only happened to T-express, we realized that other roller coaster ride wasn't operating as well. We feel like we bought a $30 entrance ticket to shop and eat in the park, really disappointed."
"Long travel, long queues.....","Everland is like the Disneyland of Korea.... I was disappointed not to be able to explore the place fully... The lines for its attractions were really long. Each attraction took us an hour for just waiting... So I find it not worth the price and time... What I enjoyed most is the picture taking, the flowers and view were really nice.. The most worth the long wait is the T-express.. It's said to be the steepest roller coaster, not sure how true but it's worth the wait. Not all rides that was indicated thrill ride is thrilling. I found some of them corny....The parade is so-so... So overall rating is just OK"
Enjoy the Ride,"Travelling to Korea twice, this amusement park gave me best impact. The rides are more exciting than the ones from Disney Land or Universal Studios, but rides like the T-Express (roller coaster) can take 90-120 minutes. The amusement park also has shops, food stalls, and very shows at night. Coming to this amusement park, reminded few childhood memories of mine in Disney Land. But if I had to choose between Disney Land and Everland, I would definetally choose Everland. I would recommend this place to teenagers, but not to adults that can get tired very easily. Because it is a very big place and there are many people, so you will have to wait for a very long time to play the rides. Also, its best to go for the whole day or at least more than 3 hours if you want to play more than 3 rides."
AWESOME!! RECOMMENDED,"This is one of the must place to visit in South Korea. Coming from Singapore and already been to Universak Studios Singapore, I think everland is rather much more exciting then Universal Studios Singapore. Please try out their T Express Roller coaster. Despite the long que, IT IS WORTH IT! The entire park is huge, if you are lazy to get from one place to the other, there are cable cars in the park itself. However it was crowded as usual with locals. Bad thing about this park is thst everything is in Korean. So you have no idea what the hell the park rangers are talking about. Apart from that, I would suggest if you book your tickets online. You can get tickets from the counter itself through the counter for foreigners but its so sad that Koreans don't follow instructions well as almost everyone in the que was all Koreans. Its a bit hard to talk to the staff as they do not really understand English well so you probably need some patience or google translator to help you. "
#1,"If you ever travelled to Korea, this is one of the theme park you MUST visit! And also, you MUST try T-Express. But only if you are a thrill-seeker. If you are not, try not to because it's scary! Overall, I had so much fun here. Bad point is, crowded due to Children's Day holiday. "
Too Congested,Took us 34 Stations by train and Bus to reach Everland!They have Free shuttle buses to bring all guest to the entrance of Ever Land.The shuttle bus driver is very reckless...the bus was congested with students/kids and tourists and all of us would literally put their weight on one another at every sharp turn.poor kids they are crushed by the adults weight.all attractions are congested about 1.5 hours wait.many 3D or 4D shows just nonsense and all in korean.. tourist cant understand a wordall shows in korean language...cant understand and enjoy the story.
Awesome Park!,We were lucky as we manage to see the Tulip Festival in Everland. Really great experience and it seems like we don't have enough time as we have so many things to do here. A must try is the T-Express which could be like 1 hour waiting time.
Less popular yet awesome,"Seoul is not really typically known for its amusement/theme parks, since we have Disney in Tokyo and Hong Kong, and Universal Studios in Kyoto and Singapore. But South Korea's Everland is an excellent find for amusement park lovers.It's vast enough that one needs a whole day to cover all of it. It may be as expanse as Hong Kong Disneyland or Universal Studios Sentosa, and has attractions and rides that will cater to all ages.Price is quite steep, but they have promos for foreign tourists, so it's advisable to have your passport and a copy of your boarding pass with you when purchasing the tickets.They boast the arguably steepest roller coaster, which looking at it, slopes nearly vertical. Too bad the weather was not cooperative and most of the fun rides were closed down.What fascinated me most was the safari park inside. You ride an amphibious safari truck and go into a mini reserve where they house several wild animals, including 3 big cats (lion, tiger, cheetah), as well as other wild animals in what looks to be their natural habitat. They also have a field of multi-colored tulips which is eye candy.Food is not hard to come by, as each section would have food courts, and food stands are everywhere.I'd definitely come back..maybe in the summer..to really experience the rides."
T-Express (Highlights),"I've been to quite a few amusement parks whenever i travel. Everland is like everywhere else. Lively, colourful, huge, and fun. When we went there, there was a celebration, a 40th anniversary of something (we don't understand the language, so we were clueless), but just in time and good for us, the admission fee is 40,000₩ each, and that include ALL rides.HIGHLIGHTS:1. T-Express: waiting time 90min for ~3min ride. But it was well worth it. Exhilarating!2. Four season Garden: Tulips every colour, everywhere. The arches around the garden were beautiful as well. There's a lot of picture taking spots.3. Panda world: this is my first time seeing a panda, so I was excited. But if you have seen one before, and that is not your thing, you can skip it. Zootopia held many other animals.To travel there from Dongdaemun took us around 2hours30min train rides/transfer. To go there: Your last station would be Jeondae-Everland station (Line Everline), Exit the station to the public bus parking lot. There's a bus stop there infront of the 7-eleven, where a shuttle bus will take you up to Everland for free. You will not miss it. don't worry. Tips: download Korean Subway app, this help me a lot to plan my trip there."
Awesome Experience,"I went to south korea on a business trip and got a chance to visit everland during one weekend. It was awesome. There are so many rides and things to do in there that it is impossible to cover everything in everland in one single day. Safari and lost valley are the highlights of my trip. No one visiting everland should miss that. Couldn't get a chance to get a ride on tex express, which is world's 5th scariest tide or so I am told. It was closed for winter. However there are other rides to scare you enough :D"
Awesome place for children,"Theme park is always a hit with children. We were there with our two toddlers on a weekday. Surprising, it was packed with people. The park is huge with plenty of activities for the young and those adventure seeker. The park itself has a zoo section, a petting zoo , a panda observatory( but it's still not open when we are there ) , Camel and pony riding etc. As similar with other theme Parks around the world, you can easily find restaurant and food kiosk all over the park. They also have a tulips festival which is in bloom now. Plenty of photos opportunity. The highlight of our trip to everland though was the private safari car ride which enable us up close and personal with the feeding of the Tigers, lions and the Bears!! Strongly recommend to go for it if you have extra cash to splurge. It is an eye opener experience with the mentioned animals surrounding your car waiting for your feed. Whoa! My two toddler boys enjoyed it thouroughly. And plus point, you do not have to queue for the safari bus ride ( as this is a popular ride, usual wait time is at least an hour or more ) Do approach the information counter prior to entering the park for pricings and timings too. We will definitely be back for the safari ride again. "
"Lively place, but gets too crowded during holiday season","The place is huge, clean, and has lots of entertainment. The crews are professional and friendly. We were going to watch fireworks at night, but it was cancelled due to snowfall. The snowfall on Everland is beautiful though, just like living the fairy tail for a moment. We had a wonderful experience. "
Awesome amusement park!,"I went with a group of people twice. We got our tickets from an Air Force base so the tickets were cheap and well worth it. The lines weren't too long either time I went and I've been to many amusement parks in the US. Around October they do an amazing haunted house thing that was actually kind of scary. We did the safari tour thing where the bus turns into a boat for a part of the trip, it was fun. I highly recommend this attraction for adults or people with children!"
A good place for children,"Theme parks are and always will be a favorite place for the children. Everland is I think the biggest theme park in Seoul. What I like about this theme park is that the queue is not as long as compared to other countries that we have visited. But the ""intensity"" of the ride is not as strong as that of the other countries as well. As compared to other countries, the rides here are tamer. Also, their 3D movies and most of the staff, do not speak English. As this is a tourist attraction, they should teach their staff how to speak english and translate their 3D and other movies, into english. If not, at least have an english subtitle so that non koreans will be able to understand.The theme park are well organized and very clean. Lots of parking space for cars and buses. Also, their food stalls are repetitive, not much choices to choose from."
Ok but...,"Was kind of two sided.. Zoo is always so sad place, mostly. Ofc there is few good things at zoo's.Too much hills for manual wheelchair user ;). And that bus company failed us badly. We called as requested day earlier but when at pick up point at morning, there was a marathon ongoing, called there, no pickup there, go this and this station. Hah, 10 minutes time to pickup with one change. Got there and called again, ""Solly, uu aal late"". No s**t Sherlock. Avoid daesung tour.Went next day by subway :)"
The best theme park ever,"I think everland is the best theme park in the world. Large, have many theme, famous with t express roller coasters which is made by wood. Really enjoyed.. "
Cool place =),"In spring it`s greatest time to visit this place. I loved attractions =) Especially wood rollercoaster =) And rotating... am... I don`t know exacltly what`s the name of that attraction (something like rock&roll). It`s great. Even just to come and walk there, very nice place =) You better to come in the morning at weekdays (less people)."
5 start theme park,Almost similar compare to Lotte World and Disneyland. Love the character. Love the parade. Try not to go in winter. Was a bit dissapointed due to the closure of the super rollercoaster due to winter
Nice amusement parc,Many games roller coasters coffee shops and beautiful zooNice gardens at that time they were celebrating 40 anniversary 
Great theme park for all family member,"I think this park has got all family aspects covered adequately. From thrill seeker roller coaster, easy riding cable car, shows, amazing flower gardens. This will suit all age family members, from children to seniors. There are also so many stores, restaurants and confectioners inside the park."
Awesome theme park!,"A little harder to get here compared to lotteworld. Go early and on weekdays if you want to avoid the crowds. When i came in, The fastest ride was only a 10mins queue and the longest was a 1 hour queue - not bad considering some theme park queues could go up to 3 hours! The T Express is one of the best known wooden roller coasters and the queue is well worth it. Went twice! Some other rides are kiddish and can be skipped (eg, spooky fun house - nothing much). Meals are expensive but surprisingly good. Lots of gift shops. I only left when the park was closing at around 6pm - you really got so much to do that you stay the whole day!"
Rollercoaster time!,Hey rollercoaster addicts! This theme park has several challenging rollercoasters which will boost the adrenaline. The theme park was also located in huge area with beautifully designed landscape
The Pride of Seoul,The theme park that defies all ages...one of the happiest place on earth! I would surely be back again❤️
Fun even in the cold,I went to Everland when I visited Korea back in February. We went on Valentine's Day which happened to be the coldest day of the 18 days I was in Korea. Many of the rides were closed due to the weather (understandable) and the rides that were open did not have long lines. We had fun but would have had more fun if we went on a warmer day. I recommend taking the family there if you ever visit. 
Amazing!!,"Very well organized, good map to visit.One day is enough for a lot of attraction.The foos is ok, we ate at the Holland village, but they also have snacks everywhere. Too bad they dont have a breakfast place, our hostel didnt have on either.The rides are intense and interesting."
Springbreak,"There is an Aunt Annie near Rose Garden, a KFC across from Rolling X-ray train. The have lockers, discount tix at Q Hotel."
Not so great ,Too much of waiting time for rides. Many are just look and feel. Only few we can feel nice.It's like just a family visit kind of thing.
Nice,"HiGood for kids and youth. We spent full one day at theme park. We didn't do the zoo part, I loved the kids area. "
Great family getaway for a full day,"This place is not only for kids and rides but also for all family members with natures. Too many things to offer. It could be a bit uncomfortable place during Winter season just because it is all about outdoor activities. However, through the year it shows flower festival and even water park right next door. Just give it a try, this will definitely give you a delightful time :)"
Enjoyable visit,"When you're travelling with kids, the highlight of their trip will always be an amusement park. Everland did not disappoint. We went 3rd week of March on a Tuesday and it was a pleasant visit. No long lines; the longest wait was probably 5 min. The kids enjoyed the safari. It was small but very clean and well laid out. There were A LOT of animals and the bears doing tricks were cute. The animals looked well taken care of. The rides were a good mix of thrill rides and the requisite rides for younger kids."
Not what I expected,"Everland is a must visit place if you are visiting Korea....I suggest that you should sleep in one of the hotels in Everland (if fully booked) than try the hotel closer to Everland (there are plenty of hotel closer to everland) .....you can take the bus shuttle that goes to everland every few minutes.....our child love this place...we stayed here from morning until they close at night. It is so big that you cannot finish all the rides in one day. We spent one day here and rides only the one that we feel is not too scary for our child (he's very young) ... but there are so many rides that our child enjoys....and the scary one I enjoyed with hubby....there are so many food stall,restaurants and many rest rooms ......! There are also plenty shops inside you can buy souvenirs....at night there are parades and fireworks...."
Everland is so much better than Lotte World,"Everland was one of the highlights of our Korea Trip. We were initially thinking of visiting Everland and lotte world but we were glad we chose Everland over lotte world. The subway ride from Seoul to Everland station is long. The train timing on the Everland line is also not frequent. It only runs every 20mins. So it is important to factor in timing if you're thinking of taking the subway to Everland. Our total travel time, including transfers was about 2hrs+. The period we were there, the land was decorated with fresh tulips! A really wonderful touch to welcome Spring Season. We were there at about 11.00am and not all rides were open. Most rides will start from 12pm onwards. We had alot of fun trying all rides from Everland including the safari rides. The T express was also the main highlight of our trip. Q times will shorten by around 5pm in the afternoon. Weekdays are also preferred as there will be much lesser people and less crowded for rides. We will definitely visit Everland again in the future."
Nice outdoor theme park in South Korea,"We came here in their 40th Anniversary at March. So we can see their Tulip flower exhibition and it is really nice.They have a lot of attraction n store inside. The most famous is the longest roller coaster in Asia. My kids love this place. But I think the attraction inside is a little bit old fashioned n technology. But is still fun for the kids.I love their food stall around the theme park. The smoked sausage, hotdog, popcorn, and many more. The average queing time for the attraction is about 20 minutes when we came. So you better scheduled your time when you want to visit this theme park. They also have a live perfomance in the street and kids also love it. They have live animal attraction. I think this is the difference from any other theme park i've ever visitted. But in the cold weather situation, the closd some attraction.Overall this is a nice theme park in South Korea!"
Soo much fun!!,"This is the first place I visit. It was a long ride but soo worth it. Is so big that a day is not enough. I love everything about it. The T.Express was incredible! You can't go to Everland and not try that roller coaster. The Hollogram was close, that was a real disappointment; but I loved everything else. "
Long bus/train ride but once there it is very relaxing,"Took 1 hr to get to EverLand Amusement Park via train & bus from Gangnam Stn.EverLand Amusement Park has various discount vouchers so you must check which one is cheaper for you via their website if you are a budget traveler.Once inside the view is very relaxing, you can take a ride but long queue, go to Lost Valley to see the animals while you are inside the amphibian bus."
Best theme park ever!!,"it take 1 whole day to spend at Everland. I buy the ticket about 40,000won include bus + everland ticket. Everland have promo for foreigner. if we buy with the shuttle bus, it much cheaper. just u have to show u passport. This place is huge. and u can get lost in it. hahaha.. A lot of place to play. Please go when weekdays. it less people. their staff are friendly. every-time will wave at u. Kid's will enjoy here. Worth to come and pay more."
Had A Great Time Here,"I came here with my daughter. She loves to play a lot of things here. Had a great time here, especially when she ride a very high roller coster. You'll spend at least a half day here.."
Happiest place,"Friendliest place as well with Lost valley being the highlight for animal lovers. Here's the place where even the staff is always smiling and waving - it's such a HUGE difference compared to One mount Snow park where 90% staff is rude and menopausal, like your visit means they have to operate rides and watch you - you don't even see a smile. Not even a fake one. Just the ""tsk"" face - especially when you want to go on the ride again. It means they have to stand there and help any kid who fall and 'clear' the path for next group. They clear your kids... Not help your kids up. And roll their eyes"
Awesome place,"Very very ice place to visit. Make sure of spending at least one full day. A lot things to see and enjoy. I strongly recommend to visit this place if you are in Korea. Best place for children! I went in winters at Christmas. It was pretty cold, but enjoyed a lot. Worth visiting!!!"
Best Amusement Park in Korea!,"Their animals are well trained. I enjoyed the shows. I also enjoyed the extreme rides like T-express. If you want to try sledding visit during Jan or Feb. The ice were melting when we got there. :(This amusement park is for adults and kids. There are places for kids, and places for adults. I loved the European Adventure. It's good for photoshoot. ;)Tickets from other sellers are cheaper! They also provide a bus from Seoul to Everland."
For adults and kids.,Theme park is better oriented for adult and kids compare the lotte world. More exciting ride. Don't go during snow as many ride will close. Be there early. As there will be many people. Journey to there is about 1.5 hours. Take a public bus from gangnam > another bus to the everland station > everland shuttle bus.Aim for the zootopia in everland.its very good and interactive. Be there early. It's a top choice for traveller. Long queue also.Long live eveland!!!
enjoy your day!,"even it's a bit far from seoul, there are lots of direct buses to get to central point seoul or the other side of seoul. guess that it takes 1 hour from seoul by bus. "
Amusement park,"Saw lots of animals and got on a bus safari and all kids loved it. We had nice weather and there wasnt so many people there. There was only long queue to the rollercoster made of wood, rest wasn't any queue. need a whole day at least to see all."
"Be patient, long queues, worth it ","Great place to spend full day but Go early as possible, get the great discounts for foreigners (almost half price) bring passport , there are locker rooms around the place. About 4 games for adults. Very friendly staff. Taxi cost around $45 from Seoul. DON'T MISS THE NIGHT FIREWORKS."
Wonderful attraction!!!,"Excellent place to visit. You can spend your whole day in this theme park without getting bored even for a minute. There are so many things to do inside. It is so colourful and beautiful. Has so many photo spots. Inside they have rides for both children and adults. They have shows going on for the kids. They have zoo, safari, parades, live performances, garden of four seasons and what not. If you are planning to visit this place, plan it a full day tour. I can bet even a single day is not enough to cover all the places inside. It took me 3 visits and still I am sure there are many more attractions left for me to experience. In the night time they have a night parade followed by a fireworks show which is excellent and MUST NOT be missed. Facilities provided are good and there are many restaurants inside. For vegans like me, there is an Italian restaurant in garden of four seasons which provides amazing pizzas and pastas."
Definitely be back.,"It was sad that we visited the place on a local holiday. Everland was overcrowded during that time so we only tried very limited attractions. Despite of that, we still enjoyed our short stay. Definitely we will be back on our 2nd visit in Seoul. :)"
Not good during winter time!,"The overall experience was good, the theme park itself was ok but we did not get to enjoy lots of rides as it was cold and snowing a bit. We were queuing for one hour for this rides called T-express but the ride closed down due to weather condition. If youre planning to visit, summer time is definitely a good time. Most of the rides closed during winter. But we still enjoyed the safari rides and other indoor activities. Recommended for family with children."
Nice themepark to visit,"This theme paomplete for family. Insode they have zoo, safari, children ride, T express roller coaster, garden, retsurant, shows. You should try T express,old fashioned coaster from wood structure but very challenging and explode your adrenaline. The location is out of Seoul. You could take Metro to Everland station then take free shuttle bus to Everland Resort.I recommend you to spend whole day and it is better if you could stay in Yongin city, cause it will be very late to back to Seoul."
MUST VISIT,"i really like the place, there are so things to do. you can spend our whole day without getting bored. They have zoo (very clean), snow, rides, foods everywhere, shopping(little expensive), light show(very magical),cable car to transfer from different part of the amusement if you are tired of walking. i really love the place and i love to go back."
Great theme park,"Been here for 3 times. Everland is better if you compare to Lotte World but its further to get to. Always choose the best mode of transport as i have taken the wrong bus before and it took more than 3 hours to get back to seoul. This place is more exciting than lotte world as it has more activities and attractions. It is a 3 in 1 theme park (Theme amusement park, Safari, largest garden). The famous T express rollercoaster is not to be missed. No one says they have been to Everland if they did not experience the T express. It will take you a full day to complete all the rides and exploration of the place. Once you are done, head out to the stores for some souvenir shopping. There is a Bean Pole outlet store outside, hence its a must go place if you like beanpole."
I could spend a whole day here,"This place is huge! I went during spring, so they had lots of flowers especially tulips. There's lots of spots to take nice photos. The rides are also fun and exciting. My favourite is the biggest rollercoaster. It was very thrilling."
A wonderful park,"I was deciding between Lotteworld or Everland and end up went to Everland as my young children chose Everland. We didn't regret our decision. Although the location is quite far. Do leave by 9pm as we left at 9.30pm and managed to take the last train back to Hongik station. Remember to check the last time departing from Gangam or Jamsil station, if you miss it you may have take a taxi which is quite expensive, the journey is very long. Do check on their website for promotion. There is a discount of 20% for foreigners tourists but we used the Easterjet 30% promotion instead.It was winter and despite outdoor it was manageable and most rides are open. We didn't managed to cover much rides as it was very crowded - we went on Sunday. Most rides queue for 45 mins to 1.5 hour. I would recommend going on weekdays.Must watch the street parades (day & nite) and the fireworks. Also must take the safari rides - tigers enclosure and giraffe closure. Walk down and take the chair lift up would be better as chairlift going down has long queue while going up has no queue at all. My children enjoy the park very much."
Winterland ! ,Magical place ! It was extremely cold and some of the rides were closed so I don't recommend going there on winter but it was still magical and very pretty place which everyone would love ! 
Good Theme Park,"This is Outdoor Theme Park, the size is big n here we can fine the Line store, if you want to anything about line you can buy here. Here we also can find some Store that sell Cloth, Jacket, etc. We also can find restaurant inside, and also a garden. When i visit this Everland Arround april and there is so many Tulips. So beautiful. But this everland actually a theme park, so you can find so many games like roller coaster and other games."
One day is not enough,"We took 5002 bus at Gangnam subway exit 6, come out walk to the bus stop in the middle of the road. You dont need to wait more than 30 mins. for the bus but make sure you stand in the line waiting for the bus not sit, because the bus is quite packed.When you arrive at the last stop, their will be shuttles waiting for you, then it is easy now. Inside the park are full of restaurants and food, some restaurant doesn't taste very good. Full of fun rides waiting time maximum are 30 minutes. You can wait for all the ride it is all fun but not the Rio 4D, not worth it for 30 minutes waiting.We are there during Feb so their are not much flower to see. The Zoo area was amazing, they have a cool boat-truck to see all the animals.Then go back easily with the same way we came. The last bus is around 22 ish."
Magically beautiful!,Seems like a fairytale with all the beautiful lightings! Almost all corners are perfectly fit for a picture. There is a discount for tourist who fly with Korean Air so be sure to keep the tix and your passport too!
Suitable for all family members.,"There are many rides and shows in the park. But if you go there in the morning on a weekday, you may not be able to see many shows because the show starts at 13.00 o'clock. The T-express is very big. Queue is very long during the weekend."
"Snowing, Safari, and Coasters","Nice 3 in 1 park. They have a snow park for sledding, two safari and orang-utan petting, and of course thrill rides. Some were closed for winter. We stayed in Q Hotel instead of making a day trip from Seoul. We didn't try Caribbean Bay because most of it was close for winter. Everland is nicely design with cable cars and lifts to help get around. "
Best Viking and Rollercoaster!,"Mad love for this place. Decided to be ""adventurous"" and changed 4 different lines via subway to get here. The best rollercoaster ride so far - T-Express! And the viking is really good too! The Churros are mad deliciously - do try them! Love the petting zoo too! Lovely themepark - Great for families,couples and even singles."
The theme park to go to,"I went to Everland early this year, when it was winter. Wasn't a great idea as most of the rides were closed, especially the T Express, however the advantage is there is minimal queue for most of the attractions. I also managed to ride their snow sled and also witness the beauty of their winter magical night. It made me fall in love with this place. You must come to this place regardless of which time of the year!!"
Rainy day,"Went to Everland for the second time with my friend. This time round it was not so fun because it was a rainy day. A lot of games/rides were closed (e.g. T-express, snow slides, and some other rides). We were very sad as we couldn't take the rides that we wanted to. T-express was opened again in the evening but we didn't take the ride. Furthermore, it is always time consuming to queue up for each ride (as it is always very long queue). So it is not very possible to take all the rides within one day. We stayed whole day in everland and towards the evening, we realized that the queue for each ride is much shorter. In all, we still managed to enjoy some rides and had a fun day. Good!"
Awesome place !,I really love this place. Took around 2 hours to arrive here from Seoul and had a great time spending my time here. I don't think one day is enough. The night view is amazing !
Far from Seoul City,Accessibility - good. you can take the train or bus going to this attraction. But allot at least 2 hours travel time of you will be coming from Seoul City.Price - fair. at the ticket booth they will ask from which country you are from - discount depends on this. haha!Attraction - fair. This is actually a good place for families. 
With friends from Singapore.,We enjoyed a lot with exciting rides and fun parades. It would be also beautiful with bloomed flowers.
Winter day in Everland,"It's very easy to catch a bus to Everland. Just go to Gangnam station, Exit 10. Go straight, pass the Lush boutique, right in front of the Who I Am boutique (it has an orange as a symbol) and take Bus 5002. It costs about ₩2500 oneway and it's the last stop. A free shuttle bus will take you to Everland; just follow the signs. I recommend that you plan your time, so that when you arrive at the park, it will be just before 12 noon, because that's when everything really opens inside the park. There are lots of attractions and rides for small children to the more adventurous adults, so age is not a problem if you're group is diverse. Make sure to check the Everland website for coupons, because it can save you a lot money. We managed to save ₩5000 for each ticket, because we found a coupon on the website. The best ride for me was the Winter Safari, because you'll ride a bus, which will enter a compound, where animals such as lions, tigers, bears, and ligers are located. Though the whole tour was in Korean, it's easy to pick-up what the driver/tour guide is trying to say. It was very entertaining. Special mention is the Romantic Illumination exhibit, which was really beautiful especially during the night time. Overall, it was a wonderful experience. I can't wait to go back during spring time."
fun place for going with friend,"This amusement park is fery fun, you can play ancient rollercoaster or you can see giant bear. Good if you want to go with family and children or going with friends who like to scream.."
A must visit in Korea ,"I looooovvveee this place for a lot of reasons. I was hesitatant at first because i thought I'd be wasting another ₩37000 due to rides i won't be able to try but the experience was worth it. First off, t express was the first ever wooden roller coaster that i have tried and it was soooo high that i felt scared at first. It was so cool literally and figuratively since it was winter (went here Dec 2014). It was also my first snow fall experience (i came from a tropical country) and most of the rides were closed after that. Good thing there were still indoor rides and the winter safari was still open. It was such a refreshing sight from the usual attractions that i see in my country. I wish yo visit everland again."
One of the best theme ark,The theme park is good for all ages. Children can see many animals and also nice cartoon figure. Teenager can enjoy ridding all fun thing. Parents can relax and enjoy walking. Dont forget to ride T-express. 
Winter Safari,"The most unforgettable attraction for me is the Winter Safari Zoo. Huge bears and beautiful white tigers are not caged! I had a close encounter with the giraffes, too! Oh, don't forget to ride the T-EXPRESS!"
Amazing time at Everland during the winter,"I went to Everland on December and it was very beautiful there. This is the first time that I went to Everland. During that time, I went there near the Christmas Holiday so they came with a Christmas theme. Normally, they will decorate the field with the flowers, but when I went they decorate with snow, polar bear, ice and others.  I only played 2 rides in Everland because I have no time to played with other rides. Because my mom and my aunt wanted to watch a parade, so I have to watch it too. While I watch the parade, the dancer come and dance with me, I think this is very good to have a dancer come near and entertain people. The parade also come with a Christmas and winter theme. It was amazing.  If we are already tired to go down, we can also only sitting on a cable car ride for us if we wanted to go down. I think it was really good because I was very tired when I walk back to the entrance. We need to walk back by ourselves because my mom forgot to go ride on a cable car ride."
amazingly wonderful,"it's worth the almost 2 hours trip from Seoul city.We were given special discount for foreigner, just show the passport to the ticket booth for foreigners. T- Money can also be used to pay for Everland's ticket/entrance fee.awesome experience having close encounter in the Lost Valley with wild animals in an amphibian vehicle and in a bus with see through glass windows. Too bad we don't understand what the guide is talking about, the guide only speaks Korean. :( Even the shows (Hologram concert, bird show, etc) are in Korean. Long queue in rides, but it all worth the wait. restaurant, cafe is everywhere, you will not go hungry.love the baby's stroller parking..the theme park is covered with lots of lights at night, it looks really wonderful. Awesome street parade.Great for all ages.One day is not enough to try everything in the theme park. i think this is better than Hongkong Disneyland :)"
Good experience!,"One thing I really liked about it was the T-express wooden rollercoaster. It took me 50 minutes waiting in line, but the short ride was really worth it. Nothing but pure adrenaline rush. The park has lots of restaurants to choose from. There are lots of attractions for kids as well.One thing I despise about it was the location. Very far from the city center. And shows were only available in korean dialect, so it's not as friendly as Disneyland in HK for non-koreans."
Good bargain ,"I get a way cheaper ticket through my hotel using its group ticket and it only cost about 20000won. The best ride definitely is t-express but I also love the ride with the shape of a guitar. It's a decent theme park considering the price I paid to get in. It is my second visit here and was not disappointed. However, some indoor facility like the upside down house only offer in Korean so foreigners have no idea what they are talking about. The food are quite cheap considering it is set in a theme park. The Christmas decoration are also quite breath taking.To get there you can either take the 5002 bus from Gangnam station or 5700 bus from Jamsil. The bus station of Jamsil is just across the street from Lotte department store. But pay attention to see if the bus have arrived since it only stop for like 5 seconds before it drives away or you will have to wait for another 20-30mins for the next bus."
Everything in 1 place!,"Been here on a few occasions & my latest visit(Dec '15) has seen new attractions added to the already impressive theme park this place is well known for.My favourite has got to bee the Wildlife section where bears of a few kinds stand tall alongside the side glass of the bus that brings u around. Awesome sight & experience when only inches away from such majestic animals ... separated only by window glass!!. Next up ... tiger & lions in 1 compound ... together!!! ... & there's the Liger - a cross breed between lion & tiger!!!. Always loved this part of the theme park.A new addition(I do recall very well it was not opened 2 years back when I was here) is the short 'safari river' ride where some species of the animal kingdom are seen from the comfort of your 'riverboat cum bus'. Elephants to zebras to antelopes to double humps camels!!!. Of course, for those who seek a 'higher & faster' form of thrill ... there's always the few roller-coaster rides. There's a section dedicated solely for the little ones. Cafes, snack joints, restaurants & souvenirs shops aplenty all over within the compound.It's safe to say one should allocate at least half if not a whole day to take in all the rides & attractions. Always enjoyed my time here especially with the kids.Getting here from Myeongdong :-1. Took subway from Euljiro 1(Green Line 2) all the way to Gangnam station. Exit 10 2.. Once on the street level, walk about 100m where there's a bus-stop(Red) with bus nos. 5002(bus-stop is just infront of WHOAU shop). Bus ride takes about 50mins from which a free shuttle bus will take you to Everland. Total time taken from Euljiro 1 to Everland is approx. 1hr30mins. You can use your T-Money for the bus ride on 5002. Getting back is just the reverse way as you would get here. Tickets to Everland are priced at a) KRW48,000(Adult whole day pass) or KRW40,000(without animal riding & special exhibition), KRW41,000 for teens up to 18 years(whole day pass) or KRW34,000(no animal rides) & KRW38,000 for those below 12 years(whole day pass) or KRW31,000(without animal rides)Hope the above will be of help. Cheers!-virgopq"
Fun! Fun! Fun!,The best place when you want to revisit your childhood. Only one thing... most of the rides and booth they do not translate in english and eveything is in korean yet it was fun. I love the place. Clean and the roller coaster ride was amazing!!!
Rush to the T-express queue upon entering Everland!,"Great themepark, spent the entire day there. I liked that there was a variety of wildlife and rides. I also liked that they had a screen to show you live updates on the waiting times for each ride. Food was rather pricey, and not that tasty."
A day fill with fun,"A day filled with fun and amusement. There are full of activities and rides here and you got to spend the whole day here. It is always packed and as usual some rides has long queue. It cover a very big area and with night activities, you might want to plan to stay a night near here as it is quite a long ride back to the city."
We love everland,"We took up a city bus to erverlabd that comes with a day pass in Everland, the theme park is big that consists with zoo safari , Caribbean Bay (did not go) we have a closed view with the animal (ride in the zoo bus) love the Christmas setting in the theme park although some of the ride are closed"
Funfilled Day!,"We visted on a Monday in early December. Weather was sunny so the cold was bearable. My teenage children had fun on the roller coaster and the whole family went on the ""Lost World"", ""Safari"" and some other family rides. We were lucky as it was not very crowded on the day (Monday) and we didn't have to queue for long, from 5mins to maximum 35mins. A friend of ours went in late Nov had to queue at least 60mins for a ride! We took the free shuttle with ticket purchase from Seoul station. It was krw38,000 per pax if I remember correctly. Do check out Everland website for details. It was definitely a fantastic deal. Getting to Everland on yr own by bus or train is definitely challenging. The shuttle bus service provides much comfort and ease after a tired day at Everland, especially in cold winter. So do check Everland website and other travel agency websites to find the best deal that includes shuttle bus service. You won't regret."
Everland. Wholesome for the young and old.,"Visited Everland during tail end of autumn and the initial days of winter. Despite the cold, me and my family thoroughly enjoyed our time here. I can dare say, we enjoyed the place more than HK Disney or even Ocean Park put together. Why?Well, for one thing, the theme park caters to both young and old. Interesting kiddy rides, wild roller coaster rides...and yes, an open Safari park, complete with animal themed rides and a sizeable zoo. Oh did I also mentioned, for Kpop fans, Big Bang hologram shows...2E1 anyone? That too...Our trip could not be complete without enjoying the evening with a wonderful display of Xmas lights and sounds...truly magical.An unforgettable time ever. That's Everland."
A must visit.. when in Korea,"I visited Everland 2 times this year but i am still ready for another visit. I love this place. This place has everything for everyone. Be it a T-express ride, night parade or Zootopia, I loved all.On can get discount upto 50% if book online (on official website).This Theme park is situated on the outskirt of Seoul but easily accessible by public transport.Highly recommended."
I'm not a big fan of Theme Parks but I enjoyed Everland.,"Visited: November 19, 2015PROS: A happy place. Not just for kids and teens but also for young at hearts. Beautiful attractions. Loved the Zootopia & Everland Safari. Almost every attractions were cool and amazing.CONS: A bit far from Seoul but totally worth it for a trip.LOCATION - 3/5SAFETY - 4/5PRICE - 4/5"
