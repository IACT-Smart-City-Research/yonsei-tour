Great place to walk around and also take the Sky Gondola.,You can spend many hours here.You can park your car down at the bottom carpark which costs 2600 won when you exit the carpark.Then you can walk up the steps to the park and the entrance to the Sky Gondola.There are food places at the top and music entertainment and mechanical dinosaus for the kids.You can walk around the cliffs to the end of the gondola track or walk around the park through 4 levels from 0.8 km - 2.9 km.The Sky Gondola costs 15000 for adults (13000 for seniors)
"IMO Most interesting place in Busan,",The views were incredible on the walk along the coast. The rock formations of different colors made excellent pictures
A must visit place for natural/trek lovers,"I really fall in love to this place when I arrive to the park. I started around noon time from Songdo beach. I walked to Busan National Geopark, where the coastal walk is. Amazing view with cable cars, ocean view, Namhangdaegyo bridge, beach, lots of stairs and small hanging bridge. Then you'll reach another side of cable car. From there you can just follow the trail and it's well marked with distance info and colours. Every colour path has different distance and directions. So I used orange and blue. Lots of stairs and it's good to have proper shoe, some trails have uneven and rocky path. Whenever I reached intersection I will choose left because that's the ocean view. The last stop would be observatory that oversee Dudo island. That's a wow view for me that I stayed for almost an hour. For return, you can opt for Busan Air Cruise/cable car to get back to songdo beach or use the same trek back. I used the same trek back for cost saving. Once reach songdo beach, you can just swim or relax to reward yourself."
Amnam Park/Songdo Seaside walkway & Beach,"the park has many trails, leading to rocky beaches & beautiful sights of ocean & city. has plenty of rest areas and restrooms. some trails are very steep, a good workout. Amnam also has the Busan Air Cruise that you could take to the Songdo Cloud Walk (aka bridge walkway). or another route is across the parking lot at bottom of Amnam park is the Songdo Seaside walkway that takes you to Songdo Beach, which on other side of beach is the cloud walk again. the beach is nice w sculpture of whales and dolphins."
"Happy to go a 5 because there's no cost involved, the views are great, and it's healthy!","To be honest, I didn't expect the journey to be arduous as it was. Point being, whereas I'm okay for a 61 year old physically, I'm not the fittest person around. I made it with relative ease, as I'm sure many do. However please don't choose to do so if you are not healthy. Some of the steps are very steep, some rough, some very lengthy. Certainly a great option if you enjoy trekking.The views, waysides and the general feeling of the walk is great and highly recommended."
NICE,"good walk, very good for the bod and mind. relaxing. very chilly now in October. come prepared. soju helps/"
Up up the hill,"I suggest people who come here to where sneakers or sport shoes, or footwear that is suitable for hiking. Cause there's gonna be a lot of hiking and up hills. The path is quite far to reach the end. But in the end you will see the sea view. There was a hanging bridge there, but it seems to be renovates so we cannot go to that path last time."
Coastal Walkway Is A Must Do,"This place is well worth the visit,the park itself is lovely but the highlight is the coastal walkway from the park to Songdo Beach which is built along side the cliffs of the ocean.The views are stunning and it only takes about 30 mins including all the stops you will make to enjoy the scenery.We walked to the beach,had a delicious lunch at a buckwheat noodle place,walked on the beach and then did the coastal walk back to Amnam park.We then caught a bus outside the park back to Nampo-dong and got off outside Lotte store where if you need to you can take the subway from Nampo station.There are quite a number of stairs to climb on the walk.You can also take a pleasant walk within the park itself."
Hiking tour at the coast not far from the city,"If you stay longer in Busan, this place is worth to visit. For us it was the third time visiting Busan and we were looking for some new places. Please be aware that the path goes up and down, you need robust shoes. But you will have great views to the sea, to the coast and also back to Busan. To reach this place or also for return, the coastal walk from/to Songdo beach is recommended. Around Songdo beach you will also find many coffee shops for a rest after your hiking."
