Good market,Always use this market. Fresh food and nice prices. And you can taste some food here/ Reccommend to visit it. 
Incheon Sinpo International Market,"Cool Market to visit if you have time. I would recomend to visit also the underground market in nearby subway stations specially if you are going for summer vacations. There's a famous spice coated fried chicken for 17000won/bucket worth the trip. Sometimes the waiting lines are huge, be aware."
A let down ,This market was abit of a let down. I expected more considering its called an international market. Nonetheless it seems more suited to the locals needs. 
Nice Little Asian Market,"This is a quaint little covered market and certainly worth a visit. However, this market is really for locals. There are several fish, vegetables, fruits, meat and Korean seaweed stalls. Also some stalls that sells apparel and shoes. Several stalls where food is served too. Nice place for taking pictures."
A nice market,"This market is for local people and you can to find local ingredient and food.In particular can try good mandù,and one famous fries hot chicken .And then there is a little shop of an ancient owen that to sell real ginger,thè and honey with ginger..very good!"
Typical Open Asian Market,"We were continuing on to the second leg of our cruise so while other folks disembarked in Incheon to head home, we took the cruise provided shuttle to explore a little of downtown Incheon. Our shuttle stop was just outside of Sinpo International Market. Lots of food stalls selling some type of fried chicken w/ a sauce on it. Also, a type of Korean pancake, and other foods. I'm not a big fan of Korean cuisine - my least favorite Asian food, plus I am very cautious about eating anything cooked in an open market with regards to sanitation. Lots of dry goods as well but nothing I was interested in getting - we were looking for a book w/ photographs of Korea - no such item or any place selling books. We wound up w/ some jam & hard candies from the Paris Baguette shop. That establishment looked very sanitary."
Sinpo International Market,"Our Royal Caribbean Cruise ship, the Ovation of the Seas had docked at Incheon Port for the day in late April 2017 and as we had 5 hours to spare, we decided to take a free shuttle bus provided by the Seoul Tourism Board to visit the nearby Sinpo International Market which was a 45 minutes ride away. It is a fully covered market with stalls selling fruits, meat and fish , Korean seaweed as well as wearing apparel and shoes . We found the prices for apparel and footwear to be cheaper here than in Seoul like Namdaemun shopping district probably because of the lower rental costs. We decided to have a cup of latte at a small cafe tucked in the Market and the five cups only cost us a total of 10,000 dong which is equivalent to US$6 only . Very reasonable indeed. It's a quaint Market place and certainly worth a visit."
Authentic food,"My visit to this market was short but I really wanted to make it there during a city tour. Of course you won't get a restaurant service; but authentic food (at a reasonable price) and a great bazaar atmosphere will give you what restaurants usually don't. Also, try their famous chicken dish, dakgangjeong."
representative market of Incheon,"this market is Incheon’s representative market with the history of more than 100 years after opening a port and also the first modern style permanent market. you can feel joyful and warmhearted atmosphere of traditional market and experience various performance as well. for more information, please follow this link- http://sinpomarket.com/eng/"
"Taste it is hot, but to have addictive characteristics, Dakgangjeong",The Dakgangjeong in the Sinpo Market which is considerably always famous in Incheon. It will occasionally look for it for a certain addictive taste that it will often look for.
Cheap lunch... Just perfect,"I visited as part of the Incheon City Free Transit tour provided by the airport. It is perfect. The market is very clean and the food is great and cheap. After eating a KRW2,000 dumplings on a stick, I am full. There are also other food and stuff you can buy."
Typical market with DELICIOUS dakgangjeong,"For me, Sinpo International Market is just like other markets in South Korea. But what got my interest was the chicken (dakgangjeong) restaurant in the market. Dakgangjeong is a crispy fried chicken coated in sweet and spicy sauce. It will definitely leave you wanting for more. Also, people are queueing just to have a taste of dakgangjeong. If ever you visited this market, it is a must that you eat this chicken!!!"
Not worth the trip from Seoul.,"If you are in this area, which I doubt, as there are no hotels here, then it is worth the visit. It is also included on the airport tours they offer for long layovers. However it is not worth visiting if you are in Seoul. It takes too long to get there, and it is a good walk from the subway although you can stay underground if you want. The market is like those seen in other parts of Korean, Seoul, Busan etc. Many stalls selling cooked food and packaged food. You can see the website for more details, but I recommend you NOT visit. I have done it and sorry I did and hopefully save you the same anxiety and frustration I had. If you do go, take metro line 1 blue line all the way to Dongincheon stop and take exit 2 and walk till you see the signs for the market."
