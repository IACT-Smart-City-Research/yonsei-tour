China in Korea,"I recommend this place if you are looking for authentic chinese food in Korea. Although the place is becoming a little bit touristy by adding cafes and such. The traditional parts are still there, if you know what you are looking for"
Can be a convenient stop to avoid dusk traffic,Nothing particularly interesting. Many Chinese restaurants selling Korean style Chinese food for sure! But why come here for Chinese food? Never mind if it is just a convenient stop to avoid traffic jam back to Seoul.
Like the China Pavilion in Epcot,"If you think this is what Chinese culture looks like, you clearly do not know much about it. Incheon Chinatown looks like a fake, a movie set, similar to the China Pavilion in Epcot. The streets lack diversity and honestly the entire area gives me the creeps. It is just weird and does not feel alive. Do not recommend."
Nice distraction,China Town is near the sculpture zone and Japanese concession.It is small enough to see in an hour.We bought Chinese pastry's and Sugar cane juice.There are lots of interesting shops and restaurants.It is directly opposite the main station.
Chinatown in Incheon Korea,This is a far better than the most to China Town I have visited. It was clean and good service then the food was great.It's a subway ride from Seoul.I highly recommend a visit if you are in ROK.
The deep culture activity taking place,"China town was a great experience, loved the mural painted on the wall of the great Korean war history "
Is it really a Chinatown if it is just a street of Chinese restaurants?,"Having been to Chinatowns in London, San Fransisco and Seattle this was somewhat disappointing after about an hour's trip on the metro."
Korean trip,It's a good place to visit in Incheon! There're also nearby places for sight seeing and take photos. 
Fairy tale land in China town,"Nice fairytale land, almost all corners of the street are themed, you can go around the whole area take photos for 2-3hrs."
Cute little Chinatown but be prepared for some hills,"While this Chinatown is very small when compared to those in New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco it packs a lot of style and atmosphere in it's relatively small area. As you exit the Incheon Metro station you are greeted by the 30 ft gate across the street. The roads are lined with various shops and restaurants as one would expect to see in any Chinatown. As mentioned the streets are very hilly. You will get a work out walking up and down to explore all the streets. If you rather climb stairs just go right by the gate walking heading south along the main street until you come to the entrance by the Japanese section by the Art Platform. Walk up the street to a small park dedicated to the boundary between the Chinese and Japanese settlements in Incheon. Climbing the stairs you reach the statue of Confucius. To your left will then be the Three Kingdoms Mural. From there you can walk back down towards the shops and restaurants or you can continue straight uphill to Jayu Park where there is a nice view of the port. Jayu and Chinatown are very photogenic parts of Incheon."
the food makes the whole trip worthwhile-ish?,"i have quite the expectation since i was travelling from seoul just to visit the chinatown of south korea (and the other stuff around) and my conclusion is - it's worth a trip if you are also visiting the other area. there are many restaurants and shops selling food and other stuff. They’re a lot of buildings, nice to take pictures. The mural is a bit of a let down because they’re all in korean and chinese, so if you can’t read them - too bad. They look good but gets repetitive (kinda boring). but there are other stuff to visit!"
Underwhelming ,Took 2 trains to get there from Songdo. Not worth it. Chinatown in San Francisco was more bustling and full of energy. We went on a weekday. Place was quiet. 
INCHEON SUBWAY STATION IS CLOSED,"you no longer can arrive Chinatown via Incheon Suwbway Train Station, as it has closed. You can't use line one or Singpu line (yellow colored line). You have to start walked around 22 min from Dongincheon subway train station."
A wide variety of activities....take at least a couple of hours to immerse yourself in the culture..,"The street food, second floor food court and local resturants are all wonderful. Bargain shopping to everywhere with a great selection of shops...The Chinese Cultural Center is a must see.....just like it was in the 1950's..."
Lovely market ,Loved this market a lot. Bought many stuff and food from it. They do sell Korean things too. Haven’t had the time to explore more as this place needs a whole day 
There were many eateries and shops selling street snacks,"We walked around Chinatown on a Thursday, and it wasn’t crowded. The start of Chinatown is just across the street from Incheon Station. There were many eateries and shops selling street snacks, and do try them as they were delicious. The Chinatown area is hilly, so it may be a little challenging for those with walking difficulties. "
Free and easy walk with family,We reached there (free and easy) on a December Tuesday afternoon 4 plus from airport hotel. The street is really empty. Not really vibrant that I expected since I've taken a 2 hrs round-trip for this. The buildings are overwhelming red to show the Chineseness. Though they have really beautiful facades for photo taking.The quality of Chinese food is quite good like simple jjajangmyun and (really fragrant) fried rice we had at a corner of the street. It only got slightly better at six in the evening with more tourists.I think it's better to go with a guide and not recommended to travel there by yourself. Just my two cents.
History underneath touristy veneer,"Incheon’s Chinatown is definitely worth a visit, since it sits at the edge of the old port and serves as a reminder of Korea’s ties to China, and the long history behind those ties. Although it has been flooded with new investment from China in recent years (easily seen in the murals, statues, and plaques that have popped up detailing the importance of Chinese influence on Korean history), the interesting pieces of that history have more to do with the way in which immigrants to Korea were treated, and how places like Chinatown served to keep them separate from the population at large. There are several museums throughout the district that cover different parts of this history, so depending on your interests, you can spend anywhere from a few hours to the whole day exploring the different options. If history’s not your thing, then just go for the multitude of street food options (warning: if you’re expecting the Chinese specialties that you may have experienced elsewhere, say in Taiwan or Beijing or Hong Kong, you will not find those here. This is decidedly Koreanized food, so enjoy it for the novelty). Bring good walking shoes and be prepared for hills. In summer, you can escape the heat by going up to Jayu Park, located above the neighborhood. That’s where you’ll find the locals, chilling under the trees and enjoying the ocean breezes with views of the surrounding city and port. It is now much easier to access by public transportation since the second Oido Subway Line opened, so you no longer have to spend half your visit looking for parking. Go for the food and stay for the people watching. Lots of places to just sit, sip a latte or a yuja cha, and watch the world go by. If you close your eyes and listen hard, under all the tourist chatter, you can still hear the sailors coming up from their ships, looking for a good meal and some entertainment while on shore leave."
Great Tour w/ My Local Friedns,"I went there with the lcoal. It was quite nice to walk along the alley. Very close to fairy tale village. If you walk a bit more to the hill, you'll see beautiful sight of Incheon port. "
Good,"It is quite small but worth to visit, lots of restaurants with excellent food. you can walk to the top of the hill and enjoy nice park and nice view as well."
Lotsa restaurants selling same thing,Good for casual sightseeing and understand a little bit of history about how the Chinese migrated to Korea in the earlier days. Whole stretch of restaurants selling the same thing so not much of a variety to choose from. 
"Top views of the hill, AMAZING",It's quite different from real chinese quizuine. But korean style chinese restaurant is really easy to try. Most of the shop food is similiar. And quite cheap.
Clean and unique.,Very unique China town with good food and coffee experience.Korean version of Chinese food here is exceptional. I love Champong.They have all the flavors you ever imagined.Fresh ingredients because it is located on the seaside. Historic streets are full of historical heritage preserved from the old day.Love how peaceful tGIS place is.
Unique area-worth seeing if you have time,"I recommend coming here as early as possible, before the Chinese tour groups come. It was quiet before 9 am and you can wander around and enjoy the feeling of seeing a Chinatown in a foreign country. I work in China so it gave me a unique perspective. I liked the Chinese cultural murals on the walk to the hillside park. Visit here and historic downtown Incheon as well if you have the time. However, it is not a must see place."
Rainy day visit ,"I always like to see what Chinatown is like in a different part of the world, as it tends to be very cultural and interesting. This one didn’t disappoint even on a rainy day. As soon as you exit Incheon station you can’t miss Chinatown across the street. All the restaurants and shops were quiet because it was of poor weather but it added to the atmosphere and we managed to walk around and see the painted murals along the wall and walked down the Japanese steps. Seeing the contrast of Japanese style buildings and then the vibrant Chinese style was interesting for the artist in me. We ate at a small restaurant that served pretty decent Chinese food. Being Chinese myself I was not disappointed. If you are in the area, do pop to Chinatown for a short visit. "
"Decent for a stroll, food not great",Came here on the way back from Wolmido. Nice to walk around the streets and have a browse but nothing really to do. All restaurants are pretty much jiajiamyeon based so go elsewhere if looking for classic Chinese food
"Busy, with a lot of restaurants ","The busy streets that make Chinatown are filled with restaurants and other services like snack foods, souvenirs and coffee shops. Free Parking is pretty limited so expect to either park far or pay for parking.A family or couple could easily spend 2-3 hours shopping and eating."
A part of China in Korea,The place is full of chinese culture and architecture. There are a lot of Restaurant who provide different chinese dishes. So many statue of different chinese culture are available there. Anyone can go there via seoul subway within one and half an hour journey. You have to take off subway on Incheon Subway Station and one minute walking distance.
Fun and nice Walkiing,"Try the Jajangmyeong. The shops are fun, out door food vendors, a fairytale village for kids. They light of the whole area at night, very pretty. The walk up the top was okat but the views were not that great. Bought some great beads"
Good food,Enjoyable place to visit right near Incheon Station. I cannot speak to the authenticity but it's a nice place for a stroll and bit to eat. 
Pretty walks and good foods,"The immigration office is nearby the Incheon Chinatown, so I made a visit to Chinatown to taste the highly recommended Chinese foods; if you are geared towards Korean infused Chinese foods, try out Boo & Boo restaurant. Walking the streets, taking in the colors and views of vendors selling Chinese buns and cookies, it was a good day spent. With the autumn season coming, there are festivities planned at the outdoor stage at the entry of Chinatown. Looking forwards to revisiting next few weeks to participate in the festivities. A definite place to visit with children of all ages."
There is a park up there,"Chinatown is really an escape from korea-world for a short time. there, you can go to the nearest park, it called jayu park. jayu means freedom in English. you can see the mural, paint about the history of korea, and since the park at the high level, you can see a port with surround ship from the park, here also some monument, I watched old people paid respect to the monument.you can also go to the fairy tale village near the chinatown, there, there are lots of cartoon mural, lot of spot to take pictures. i also bought a rose-ice cream. the price is much cheap from myeongdong street, seoul."
Fun place for family time or a date,"It’s a small area next to art museums where you can experience Chinese culture and food. They have quite a lot of “맛집” (mat-jib) there, which is famous restaurants with great food. They have lots of nice street eats too, so you’ll never get hungry when you’re there. "
Awesome jjajangmyeon!,"There's a museum that introduces you to the history of jjajangmyeon. The jjm, jampong and tang su yeok in Yeon Gyeong is really good, it's usually queueing. "
Beautiful,"Visited this place in the evening. There are a lot of beautiful buildings and restaurants spread around. A couple of parks are also situated in the area. There were not many people around, but looked like a nice place to spend some time or just chill out.A few bakeries were also in the area, we tried food at one of the many chinese restaurants and food tasted very good.Good place to visit."
Atmospheric ,"First visited 2 years ago at dusk and it felt very atmospheric and like a filmset. Went around lunchtime this time round and it was quite quiet though some shops were open. Had jjajangmyeon at one of the restaurants which was reasonably priced and delicious. Quite a few shops selling tarts and pastries and we bought some pineapple, melon and chestnut ones to try. Interesting place but best visited in the evening when it comes alive."
Enjoyable ,Quite fun and beautiful buildings in China. There are main beautiful restaurants. The area is safe and people are quite friendly. 
A Cute Slice of China in Korea,"I love the architecture and feeling of this small Chinatown in Korea. There are lots of great places to eat and when it hits around noon time, some places start forming lines. There is also Freedom Park nearby and the Fairytale Village all in walking distance. It's definitely worth a visit, even if you're not the biggest fan of Chinese food. I arrived at around 11 and it was still quiet around the streets, so come early if you want to go to a hot spot!"
Chinatown and Jjajangmyun ,"Since I had some time, I decided to take a day trip to Chinatown and do some sightseeing and have some famous jjajangmyun that originated here in Incheon. Toughest part of the visit is walking up steep hills. My legs really hurt the next day from doing all the walking. "
Free and easy ,"Nice the main door of Chinatown , maybe the weather was cold a lot shop was closed when I reach at 5-6pm "
"Colorful,Happy, Lucky, CHINATOWN","Climb the steps from bottom to top,or jog up like I did. What a workout. At the top you are greeted by a beautiful shaded circular walk with great views of the surrounding area. Plus weekend activities and live entertainment. Up and comng K-POP artists. Great restaurants and a few museums round out a fun day in Chinatown in Incheon"
Authentically Chinese Appearance ‘Cept for the Inauthenticity,"When you stroll through these streets you could imagine being in China. Of course if you’re on a layover in Incheon on your way to China you may wonder why bother. The reason is that this is a sanitized, monetized Chinatown. Trinket shops galore. "
Good place for a walk ,The area where you find a lot of great & designer cafes. It is worth going there for example in a break between flights.
A lot of fun ,"The tourist bus drop us there, last stop , not other option . We enjoyed the afternoon , nice and entertaining place . There are souvenirs shops , restaurants, local snacks shops , pictures shop to dress up like old folks , nice Chinese Korean buildings , Art space and up hill a park with nice sea views and the Max Arthur’s statue commemorating the landing to freedom! "
Small but fun,Had a good time in Chinatown. Week-ends are the best time to go there. My grandchildren enjoyed themselves but they did get tired walking up and down the hills. We had a nice dinner and shopped at a craft market. We also went to a museum that was fun.
A not-so Chinatown,It's actually thing less than a typical Chinatown. It feels more like a studio where the shops are just props. 
Worth a visit,"It’s a must to try some of the specialty Jjajangmyeon when in Chinatown. Not the usual black bean sauce kind but you can actually find a variety of Jjajangmyeon there. There’re also a few stalls there that are popular among the locals and tourists, selling buns, dumplings and more.While in Chinatown, you should also check out the Songwol Fairytale Village which is located at the end of the street. Lovely village with beautiful mural art and cute fairytale structures!Chinatown is located opposite Exit 3 of Incheon subway station (Line 1). You won’t miss it for sure when you are there!"
A lovely day out,We loved walking through all the little shops around China Town. A beautiful garden at the top to relax in. Top tip: don't forget your umbrella!
Short Stay,Kinda mini for this area. We walked along main shopping street. Find something to eat and drink. 
Food ... Food... Food.. and experience =),"Honestly we had time to spare due to some airbnb issue, so decided to take a bus and train to Chinatown from incheon airport... Didn't expect much but it was a fun day indeed. The reason we were there was to checkout the 'Songwol-dong Fairy Tale Village' nearby and since its next door we decided to check out Chinatown as well. You cant miss it as the moment you exit Incheon train station you at met with the large intricate design of the entrance of Chinatown. The place is filled with chinese restaurant selling jajjangmyun and otehr chinese delicacies but all are non-halal therefore for muslim travelers may not be able to enjoy such dishes here. Fret not, the will be a small chinese shop selling handmade dimsuns that is only prawns or chicken and soo good.... They also sells lamb skewers and other types of street food to chase the hunger ways. Anywhere in chinatown they sell this round crispy cookies thingy that i didnt particularly find interesting but i had my first squid skewer there and boy , it was sooo much (A MUST TRY ..=) !!) , beware there will be multiple bottles of RED sauce on front only try of you truly love spicy and can handle the heat ... I love my spices and spicy chillipadi and can handle Malaysian and Indian heat.. but the sauces does creep and would just trap the heat at the lips and mouth .. hahaha .. memorable first impression of Korea as its my first time setting pun in the beautiful land.. cheers!!!"
Enjoyable place to walk throigh,"We visited China Town on our walk to the Incheon Train Station from Jayu (Freedom) Park. The entrance to China Town from Jayu park, is located at the Confucius statue. We were interested in taking a photo of the Conficius statue as we had previously visited the Koryo Museum, located in North Korea, which was the site of the Confucius Academy in Korea. It was interesting on our visit there, that no statues of Confucius were on display. It is also interesting that the statue is placed on the border of the former Qing (Chinese)and Japanese settlements.There is a pathway of stone lanterns that leads to Chinatown below the statue.A few gift shops, but mostly restaurants were seen. Quite a few statues, Chinese gates and bright decorations allow for many great photos.This area is easily visited from the airport. we took bus 306 to Don Incheon station, then a train to Incheon station. At the exit of Incheon station turn right and walk a few minutes to China Town. There is a tourist information center at the Incheon Train Station which is very helpful, and will provide walking maps of the area."
Interesting,"As a Singaporean Chinese visiting Chinatown in Korea, I would say this was very interesting to see how the Chinese live in Korea. The architecture is familiar, and the Chinese food sold here is slightly different from the usual Chinese food that we eat. The lack of souvenirs shops was fine for us as we weren't looking to buy any. There is a jajangmyeon museum hre as well, definitely worth visiting!"
Not worth,Did not have any suvinior shop. Only has restaurants. Not worth visiting unless there is too much free time in the trip schedule. 
Strolling around Chinatown,"Chinatown is Incheon is just a simple place, nothing to see. There are chinese restaurants, I haven't tried though. If your schedule is tight don't bother to include Chinatown in your schedule. "
Incheon China Town: An Impressive Attraction One Hour Away from Seoul by Metro,"Many overseas visitors to Seoul who used to enjoy delicious old style Chinese foods in Korea would have difficulty in finding Chinese restaurants in Seoul proper which serve familiar Chinese foods. Many Chinese restaurants in Seoul are now serving fusion dishes which are different from the old style Chinese foods. But many restaurants in Incheon Chinatown still serve many of the Chinese dishes such as ""black bean noodle"" (Jajangmyun) with familiar taste.Incheon Chinatown is more than a place where you can enjoy delicious Chinese foods. The Chinatown has been transformed into a tourist friendly village type of place where visitors can enjoy wandering around for half a day. Besides Fairy Tale Village for children, the streets are filled with exotic looking Chinese buildings. Some alleys with long walls have painting of interesting scenes from important Chinese literary works such as Romance of Three Kingdoms. The elevated plaza has 12 stone animal figures depicting birth year cycle like Western zodiac. A statue of Confucius can be found nearby, and a memorable Freedom Park with imposing General Macarthur's statue is also adjacent to the Chinatown.You can visit Incheon Chinatown from Seoul by metro line # 1 at nominal cost, and the travel time is about 1 hour.From any metro stop for line # 1 stop in Seoul, take the metro line # 1 with its destination as ""Incheon"", and stay on to the last stop ""Incheon"". Be sure to take the metro train with the destination sign ""Incheon"", because some line # 1 heading to the same direction have different destination than Incheon. As for the metro ticket, make sure to buy the ticket to Incheon as the destination. As the metro train gets near Incheon area, it comes up to the surface and runs like a regular surface train. At the last stop Incheon, get off the metro train, and walk out of the metro station to the station plaza on the left hand side. You can even see the Chinatown buildings to your left side of the track as you walk toward the station building. [Do not follow some passengers who take escalator down to the lower level from the platform, because this down escalator is for the passengers transferring to another line].As you get out of Incheon metro station, turn left to the tourist information office for a map of Chinatown.Then, you can cross the street, and enter Chinatown through the tall archway, and enjoy the surroundings.Different visitors recommend different restaurants for lunch. As for me, I would recommend Yun Kyung Restaurant (a tallest building in Chinatown) for lunch. This restaurant was used as Bong Family's restaurant in 2016 Korean drama series ""Happy Home"" (가화만사성). The foods at this restaurant are delicious at reasonable prices.Incheon Chinatown is where you and your family can really enjoy at least for half a day. [I am posting separate reviews on Yun Kyung Restaurant and Freedom Park at TripAdvisor site]"
Food court only,"I though would've something to buy, I mean souvenir. Good very expensive be careful. Place is good to take picture only. "
Good Stroll and Authentic Chinese,Neat shops and a nice stroll walking to the top of the mountain for nice views. Authentic eating makes this a great visit as was the Chinese Noodle Museum demonstrating the bean paste noodle dish that the area has become famous for.
Only worth it if you visit nearby fairytale village ,"This is a tourist trap. The only thing to do here is eat overpriced noodles and soup. You can eat the same black bean noodles and spicy seafood soup anywhere in Korea for much cheaper and with a bigger portion size. Most of the restaurants have the same, limited menu. There were a handful of unique snack stands like one selling sugarcane juice and another with tasty dumpling buns. I did like the Taiwanese pineapple shortbread cakes. I tried to find Chinese souvenirs but only saw a few cheap, overpriced trinkets. The fairytale village is right next to it. It's mostly for children but it's kind of cute for taking pictures. There's also the famous Cafe Oz where you can have ""blackbean noodle"" icecream. Going to either place on its own may not be worth it, especially if you are traveling solo."
A little chinatown,"A little Chinatown in Seou,with Chinese restaurants and Shops. ..a jump in another culture. .very nice place for a different morning. If there are childrens is recommended to have the stroiler!"
Nice place to stroll through,A nice little China Town on a hill worth a stroll through. Lots of shops with stands on display outside selling souvenirs and nick knacks. There was also a great store with delicious asian pastries. Easily accessible by public bus.
Various kind of sites to enjoy,There were lots of foods and various kinds of sights like old Japanese houses. I could enjoy noodles and dumplings and tasted the old time sitting at colonial Japanese house.The street of jajangmyeon was heavily entangled with cars and people. It would be better that some roads are without cars.
A Small But Interesting Area,"A pleasant uphill walk from the subway station reveals a nice area with Chinese restaurants, stalls selling street foods, and tourist trinkets, and people walking about. The mural street is lovely and very interesting if you take the time to check out each tile Mural. At the top of a hill is a nice little garden park with good views. Also we also found a small Buddhist Temple up there as as well."
Include this in your Itinerary!,"Lots to see! Unique coffee shops and restaurants that you will not find in Seoul.If you are here, visit these too:-jayu park-songwoldong fairytale village"
Nice to stroll.,A lovely place to spend a morning strolling through the streets and up the hill through the gardens.
Worth a visit!!,"Interesting area with lots of see and buy. Worth a few hours. I'd recommend to have lunch, and then spend 2-3 hours walking around as it's quite a large area. They have various streets including Fairytale Village, the Jajangmyeon museum, and lots and lots of street foods to try!They have cartoon cotton candy, red bean cakes, nitrogen cereal, various yummy pastries, meat skewers, and lots more.They all speak Korean and Mandarin - with some level of english, so you should have no problems communicating with them."
Small Chinatown that seems more Korean than Chinese,"My advance reading of the Incheon Chinatown led me to believe that there would be more authentic Chinese activities and shops, rather than the local (Korea) fare. We did buy several items to eat (""food on a stick"") as we strolled through the busy streets on a Saturday afternoon. You can always tell where the locals like to eat as some of the lines were very long, while non-existent at other food stalls."
LOVELY AREA,The pavements are undergoing repairs ready for High season but very safe to walk around. People are very friendly and lovely atmosphere lots of trinkets souvenirs and food to enjoy.
Not bad and not great,So many tourist the lines for restaurants are ridiculous. Jjajangmyeon was on par with the rest of Korea.
Not a real Chinatown ,"You will be very disappointed to go a Korean version of Chinatown in Incheon. There's nothing authentic about that area, and you may find one Chinese person around, if you're lucky. The most popular ""Chinese"" dish there is nowhere to find in China, a total Koreanized black noodles. "
Highly disappointed,"I'll echo what others have said about this place: it is AFWUL. It seems to be a run down area in Inchon with some stores selling cheap looking survivors and overpriced ""so called"" Chinese restaurants. I paid 30,000 Won for a chicken dish supposed to be on a hot sizzling plate. However The chicken meat turned out be chicken fat battered in flour then deep fried with some kind of Korean sauce on the top. In addition, the dish was not even hot. After I told the waitress about this issue, she warmed it up in the microwave oven... needless to say, 30,000Won left the wallet and still feeling very hungry. I wish I did not take the hotel staff's suggestion and did not eat in the restaurant which sits by the right hand side of the big stairs after you walk up to the end of the big slope. Will not return."
Trip for the foodie!,"Chinatown in Incheon is a good destination for the food lover! You can find a lot of restaurants and interesting eateries here. I personally loved the egg tart place in Chinatown. Transportation: You can just take the Line 1 subway in Seoul Station and then get off at the last station which is Incheon. There's only one exit at Incheon station. Upon exit, you will see Chinatown! :)"
Special Cuisine Exploration,"This area is mainly about food exploration. You will have the opportunity to taste food that is created by the Chinese immigrants in Korea. It will be something unique, like traditional Korean food but not Korean cuisine. It is very interesting especially for people who knew about Chinese cuisine from China or Taiwan."
Good for the first time,It has tourist trap written all over it. Good for photos but the street is a short one. Unlike the other streets like kwangjang or pyounghwa fashion district. I had the zhajiang noodles and seafood rice soup. It's a Korean type of Chinese food. So it's slightly sweet. The noodles are springy and diff like Japan thicker ramen. Costs are ok. Abt W7000-15.000.(SGD9-20)
Typical tourist trap,"Perhaps it was because we are Asian and familiar with the Chinese culture. This entire place is a tourist trap with overpriced Chinese food. To give you an idea of how exorbitant it was, we paid 50,000won for 2 people for substandard Korean-style Chinese food. Puny pieces of fried batter masquerading as tangsuyuk. The street was littered with shops selling cheap looking trinkets and there was nothing worth specially making a trip there for."
Not up to my expectations!,I was expecting to see a vibrant Chinatown but it was rather quiet with some tourists and local visitors.
Lovely chinatown,"Just stroll in chinatown, buy some chinese food and/or products.If you are going in summer, you can buy weird ice cream and other sweets.Don't forget to go to the kinda-Disney place at the end of Chinatown on the west."
Chinatown in Korea (Original Taste of Chinese Foods in Korea),"This is the are of Chinese people who came to Korea for work and commercial since very long time ago. You can see the multi culture that mixed together. Don't forget to taste ""Jjajangmyeon"" (Black Noodle) as the original taste. "
Great restaurant,China town in Inchoen is slightly bigger than I expected. There are so many restaurants and gift shops located within the place. I recommend to try a bread filled with red beans it was tasty and really warm to eat during a rainy day. The town has a lots of slope so some people might get exhausted easily.
visit only if you have spare time,"no point to be there if you are Chinese, but if you are not, ok worth to spend some time there maybe less than an hour. the nearby area is even more attractive than the China Town itself (e.g. museum and the Incheon art platform)"
Ok place to visit for some Korean style chinese,"Okay place to visit but the TV shows have hyped up the place. The price in various restaurants seemed over priced for the location. However, it's worth a visit."
Historical town,"This is one of the popular places in incheon that you can see the unique town style, building, restaurants, wall art history story of China & museums! Of course taste Chinese foods. The town adjuncts to the fairy story village, jayu park (freedom park) & Incheon station tourist information Center. "
Good choice to picky eaters!,"Are you losing your weigh?Do you fall in love w/t Asian cusine?Here I am.It is not easy to eat basic method dishes in Asia.If you have experienced in Chef fields,You should visit your future patners.I recommend that you do well.Not too be able to be enchanting here."
Fake Chinatown,"Fake Chinatown ever thing fake if you want to Chainatown this not your Chinatown is your image , everything expensive "
really nothing to do,Good Chinese food! overly priced goods and toys. there is a lovely walk near by and a nice trail. close to the sea port. quite dirty and the Chinese seemed to leer at the tourist. 
nice chinese atmosphere,"best Jajamyeon is here ! very vibrant and colourful, although its in Incheon not Seoul. but if you're westerners, it worths coming!"
Chinese restaurant I visited ,Exciting sightseeing. Many interesting history stuff there with good food but too hard to get there at least for me. Interesting place though.
No much things ,"I found there by chance when I visited Incheon so I can't say disappointing but if you come expecially for this maybe happen to you. There restaurants, some shops, that's it.But you can make one day incheon trip which includes several destination in incheon city. Next to station there is tourism office which arranges this. Before come check from web site.The good things is you can come here by subway , very cheap. You so won't lose anything."
Small Chinatown in Inchon,My friends are takes us Chinatown in Inchon. I have never really sightseeing in Inchon. It was great to see at least once!!
Interesting,Well worth a visit. Numerous restaurants but difficult to determine which to use. Safe walking. Easy to find taxi. Typical Chinese architecture. Little English spoken.
Good food,"In the past, the area held many stores trading goods imported from China, but most Chinese businesses are now restaurant . "
Too much Koreanized.,"Looked for dimsum but couldn't find one. And if you are a senior, watch out. Chinatown is on a hill. But at least it is very near to a subway stop."
As the name suggests,"A collection of koreanized Chinese restaurants, some nice (and overpriced) cafes and street food vendors. It was my second time here, we've first visited at night when almost everything was closed yet somehow I enjoyed it more than this time. Daytime the place was obviously more crowded and everyone seemed to be weirdly fascinated with staring at each other. Due to this I was kind of weirded out for half the time, so it ruined the experience for me a little. Another thing that was more prevalent at daytime, is the surroundings of Chinatown which is a gritty industrial setting so it didn't feel attractive at all. I'd say, go there once for the experience, take a relaxing walk on the top of the hill and visit an antique shop for a purer traditional mood."
Good way to spend the evening in Incheon,There are some really nice restaurants in here and the FairyTale village is also located in the same area.
Colorful,"An extensive Chinatown! Lots of restaurants, but long lines at the more popular ones. Outdoor food stands with interesting items! "
Walk thru,"It is a nice area to walk around, see the gates, take in the mural wall & appreciate the Korean Chinese culture. We took a taxi from Song-do - about 30 minutes. The best part is the proximity to Jayu (Freedom) park. The park is beautiful, historic, great views and worth the trip. We were fortunate to hit peak cherry blossom time in April."
Disappointing,Much of Chinatown is built on a steep incline and is really nothing more than a collection of restaurants.If you are not hungry and in the modd for Chinese spend your time elsewhere as there is little of interest here.
Cool Chinatown,"We took bus 306 from the airport and got off at the Incheon Station which is directly across the entrance to Chinatown,The journey was about 50 minutes and the ride was comfortable.Being Sunday, the crowd was there giving the added excitement to the place.We walked up a slope with shops and restaurants at both ends.At the end of the road we turned left and there were couple of good Chinese restaurants where we tried the local delicacy.. the black bean noodles."
Good Authentic Korean-Chinese Food and Interesting Streets!,"Went there on a date and it was better than I thought it would be, granted my expectations was not the highest to begin with. You better look up the listings for the really good restaurants here it is worth it, don't go there blindly, the food quality varies quite much from what I can understand. So it is crucial that you find a good restaurant. After eating you cna choose from several cafe's shops or interesting side streets. Go it is a bit different for sure!"
Cool little spot,Pretty small but worth the visit. Great place to find little toys for the children. Good food and snacks are plentiful. Bring your camera you can see some beautiful art.
Good food,"If you are looking for a good Chinese restaurant in Incheon, it is a place to go. Price is not that cheap but tasty to pay that much. "
Nothing to shout about ,Just come here because we stayed nearby. Mostly people here for (slightly)over priced Chinese Korean Food. Not exactly fantastic except for the special Chinese crispy bread :). 
Very small China town,"Not bad attraction. There are some restaurants and street food, plus souvenirs. However the place overall is quite small. Half of it is a park, which is very relaxing and full of trees covering the strong sunlight. "
Incheon Tour by Koridoor Tours,"I took the Incheon Tour by koridoor on weekend. We went to the Modern Architecture Museum first which I could learn the histiory through modern architectures. Even though it was raining in the morning, we all were still excited to go on the tour. At the museum, I could see how historic structure represents the modern times and the historic moment at the port. The scenery of Incheon Port was so nice. We went to several Museums there, and what I was really excitied for is Chinatown. My favorite place was Jjajang myeon museum. Chinatown has not only the cultures of China but also the trace of the modern history of Korea with represetation of the actual scene of citizens there. We had Jjangmyeon for lunch and it was so delicious for me. The Chinese restaurant seemed a unique one and I could feel the combined flavor with chinese style with Korean food. After lunch, we moved to Wolmi Island, and it was little tough for me to go up to Wolmi observatory, but it gave me a spectaculer view from there. While climbing the hill, we all were chatting to each other and other people in the tour also very kind and fun. I had a really great time and enjoyed so much for my weekend tour. I, so, recommend anyone who is interested in tours by Koridoor."
Nice to visit although wont rush back,"Visited yesterday with the primary task was to find some Chinese spices if possible and of course eat lunch.Train ride from Seoul Station was 67 minutes and once there just followed the crowd across from the station to the Chinatown streets.Quite pretty area, although artifical. Super crowded however and once we decided which restaurant queue to join it was a solud 45 minute wait in the cold to get inside. Food was good although had a Korean twist on the Chinese we were expecting.It is worth the visit for the brief sightseeing but will wait for some friends to come from overseas before heading back again"
Small and pretty average Chinatown,It was crowded with Koreans when I went on a weekend. The Chinatown is nothing to shout about. It's actually pretty small and the shops are not really that interesting. The street that sells street food is just a small section and a lot of the food they sell there aren't really Chinese. And selection is minimal. Didn't visit the restaurants there but a lot of them have pretty long queues due to advertisements of celebrities. Other than that it really isn't a very interesting Chinatown to visit. It is a long way from Seoul so not worth travelling to.
Overhyped place,Only some Chinese restaurants and a wall of fame showing chinese historical incidents are there. You can visit for good chinese food only.
Fully Changed Feel as a China,"Chinatown is perfect place for buying Chinese products, way of life Chinese, Museum ,survivors , I feel it was china, faces are same, accent and foods. Within shorten time it was great feeling and authentic."
Gourmandism at Incheon Chinatown,"You can enjoy chinese cultures and dishes there. You can see a wall painting based on a novel, the romance of three kingdoms. There are lots of chinese restaurants, where you can eat chinese dishes. Zhajiangmien is what you must eat there since the zhajiangmien of here is a litttle different from that of other areas."
A nice small Chinatown,"Chinatown in Incheon, is a beautiful small town even though the whole area is about few streets. You can enjoy the beautiful scenery of the port and the sunrise since the town is on a small hill. The area is relatively clean with a quite choice of Chinese restaurants. If you are vegetarian, you can find two or three restaurants that offer good food. In these restaurants, you could even have chicken and meat made out of bean but really taste like chicken. If you are fond of Confucianism there is a standing status of Confucius with a short historical explanation of his philosophy. To sum up, Chinatown in Incheon is worthy to visit."
Good for short visit,Interesting little area for a short visit. Restaurants very popular at weekends and long queues at most.
Disappointing,"We were a bit disappointed by this. It is proclaimed to be the biggest and nicest Chinatown in Korea, but is all in all 4 streets or so. Nice to pass by on your way to Freedom Park (go through the gate at the end of Chinatown leading to the park, only thing really worth the visit), but that's about it. Lots of restaurants, but we didn't try them. If you plan on buying something, make sure to haggle over the price!"
Lots of restaurants,We went there for lunch with a group of military retirees. About 4 streets long loaded with Chinese restaurants and food vendors selling various kinds of cookies and stuff. Lunch was great.
"jajangmyeon street, no more than that","all you can see and do in this town is jajangmyeon restaurants, eat delicious but also historic jajangmyeon. that's all."
Perhaps the most mediocre Chinatown in the world,"Don't go to this Chinatown if you're looking for anything authentic. Chinese food in Korea is Korean food with Chinese characters, nothing else. And you won't find even many Chinese people left. The best part of this place is ironically a Western restaurant owned by a British guy."
Chinatown at Incheon,"Most of big cities in the world have a china town, but in Korea there seems to be only one place in Incheon.There are so many chinese reastaurants along the main streets, but the tastes are almost similar, take a seat & have a black bean sauce noodle!Within 10 walking minutes, at the top of hill, there is a statue of General Macarthurhe seems to be a hero in Korea who saved from Korean war."
China in Korea,"There has many restuarants and not expensive. There used be location for shooting many films, varity , dramas. You can see all around by walk 1- 2 hour "
Well known Inchoen Chinatown,We walked through Chinatown and looked at the old architecture and there were wall murals of the history of China and Korea. We walked up to Jayu Park and around the old town. We met a nice man who encouraged us to go to Wolm-do Park and hike up to the observation tower. We did and enjoyed the view of the Incheon Harbor. 
Great environment for the family,"We spent great time together walking and see traditional buildings. Surrounded with street food, Chinese stuff ect. They have park around there and museums."
Fun walkint area,We stayed a few blocks from Chinatown. This is an area that is a great area for walking--lots of interesting little shops and restaurants and very near the big park with the MacArthur statue. Highly recommended for a nice morning walk
Too commercial and not enough information,"It was interesting to see the difference between Japanese area and Chinese area in Incheon.Despite it is known as Chinatown, the area has 2 distinctive characters depending which countrymen were dominating back then (ca. 50 years ago?)Chinese area had lots of restaurants and shops....way too many maybe.You feel like you are walking through cheap Chinese souvenir shops rather than historic Chinese place. I was somewhat disappointed by the shops only streets. If you see one, you saw them all already.We wanted to visit a museum exhibiting old life style in the area, found in internet when we planned the trip to Incheon. We could not find at all. Went to tourist center and even Police station, but it was unknown to all. What a pity.Looking at old buildings still maintained quite well was one good thing.I just wish they did not have too many of same shops everywhere."
Little China in Incheon ,We had a great visit exploring the streets and all the areas. It is good to explore it just in two hours. Just be prepared for walking up hill.
Very crowded place on sunday,"We visited this place on Sunday and there ware so many people on the street, starting from the mural village. All the restaurants have long queues, honestly if you are looking for authentic Chinese foods, this is not the place, since they mainly serves Korean Chinese foods. But still fun to watch so many ppl and the snacks that they sell"
Best Chinese food I ever had!,"We heard about the Chinatown while we were visiting on business trip. Taxi service to the Chinatown from our hotel (Oakwood Premier Incheon - check out my other comment about this hotel) was about 25-30 min, depends on traffic.The Chinatown street was clean and vibrant with people from everywhere. We tried one of the Chinese-Korean style dishes and we fell in love with it. There are places you can walk around after your delicious meal, it's called Freedom Park, and this is in commemoration of the U.S. led U.N, allies landed on the shores of Incheon during the Korean war in the early 1950's. You'll find the statue of General MacArthur there. "
Displaying Chinese Culture,"From Seoul, take the subway line 1 to Incheon station. Exiting the station, you will see the first Paeru ( gate) that symbolises Chinatowns worldwide across the road. Walk pass the gate and continue walking straight ahead until you reach Fairy Tales village. Visiting the place brings back memories of yesteryears. However, I was very surprised that the fairy tales featured were not Chinese ones as this place is in Chinatown. After visiting, continue walking straight ahead for about 100m , looking across the street you will see a mural on the wall, featuring the 8 fairies. Continue to head uphill, then veer left at the junction to find steps leading to the third Paeru and the twelve Chinese Zodiac figurines. At the top of the stairs , you will see The Three Kingdoms mural walls. At the starting point of the wall, you will see two golden dragons guarding the signpost Three Kingdoms. Go down the stairs opposite the two dragons until you come to a stone statue of Confucius. The stairs serve as the boundary between the Qing and Japanese concession areas. All over Chinatown , you can find Chinese restaurants and bakery shops."
commercialism runs this area,If you are looking for a place that ranks high on getting money you have come to the right place . Restaurants are everywhere . Lines of people outside of a lot of places . Make sure you have good walking shoes even though it is a small area . Not far away is the statue of General McArthur in a very nice park. So you can view the General and also get a good view of the bay.
5 stars for Stop Over tourists. ,"If you have short time, why don't you try China Town in Incheon. If you visited Seoul already, why don't you visit China Town in Incheon so you can enjoy longer time. my Viewpoint: It is nothing itself alone. It is great if you enjoy China Town together with Mural Village (= Fairy-tale village) and Freedom park and beach in Incheon. visit.korea Kevin Dream. "
"Interesting, but underwhelming","For being touted as ""the only real Chinatown in Korea,"" I expected a bit more. Sure, there are some good food stalls worth stopping by, but it's really not a very large area. There are standard souvenir shops and there is a small temple area. Be prepared to climb some big hills. Unless you're already in the Incheon area for something else, like a visit to Wolmido, I wouldn't encourage you to go out of your way for it."
Not much like China,"Doesn't remind me of China at all. It just seem like a run down part of Korea, and they are trying to pass it off as China because they sell Dog Soup there."
china town visit,china town has a small museum like thing and history of korea it has old japan embassy etc...n down few lanes you have some shopping area...n food of korean chinese
Average,"Visited on a Sunday and found it very busy. Long queues at the car park and the restaurants.Souvenir shops with standard fare - probably more fun for families than singles, or someone interested in culture.Restaurant food is pretty standard fare, nothing particularly exciting."
Very small area but interesting,"If you have high expectations, you'll be very disappointed if you come here. However, if you make this only one part of your plan for the day, then you'll enjoy it. There are three or four streets which have Chinese stores with souvenirs and only one main road that has most of the restaurants. But if you're into taking pictures and enjoying some garlic chicken or noodles with black bean sauce, then you'll have a good time here. There is also a street dedicated to animation and cartoons which is great for kids and also for taking pictures. Not far away is a statue General MacArthur who was the general during the Korean War at Freedom Park. If you get there early and done early, you can also make a trip over to Wolmido (an island nearby)."
I loved it,"I loved Chinatown, as I personally found many things to do even if it was cold winter. But it was indeed a weekday, so there were barely any people which would make a difference. The restaurants are the typical Chinese one in Korea, but one we visited in Chinatown was particularly good tasting. Also there are many other stalls around that sell different Chinese foods, that taste amazing and are very cheap. I particularly recommend the small stall that sells siltarae (실타래) which is long strands of honey strings gathered together to make a string ball of goodness. They also show you how to make them, which is interesting. There are many places to take photos, look around for souvenirs and just look at. The venue is also located near many other places so if in the area, I'd say it's worth a visit."
Interesting,"They have blackbean sauce noodle restaurant museum with the story behind it, also a fantasy land with various pretty mural painting, korean and japan cultural bridge and staircase,pavilion here you can see the whole city and of course a lot of chinese restaurant spread around the street.. in weekend its so busy but its a nice place though.."
Interesting to a point.,"Chinatown Korean style. Steep streets line with red lamp posts and lots of Chinese restaurants. To me there was not much there, but the locals love it, obviously favourite restaurants and food stalls with long lines winding down the street. If you are in the area, have a look "
Best for souvenirs etch,I had read all the reviews that said little India and china town sold the same items at around the same price. I visited little India first and thought it was good so didn't get to china town until almost the last day of my holiday. That was a mistake. China town is very different to little India. The items for sale are cheaper and of a better quality. I would recommend visiting China town first. There is good selection of food and drink here also. 
It is great during the night,"I always go to Incheon Chinatown when I feel like eating Jjajangmyeon (짜장면) and JJamppong (짬뽕). As they you can experience eating the most authentic food in the place where it was discovered. Chinatown is best visited during during or night. Although some establishments are closed, you can see the colorful lights that decorate the place. Try also hiking the hilly part of the place. There is a nice view deck overlooking the city of Incheon and the harbor. Try also visiting park that is adjacent to it. There are also Japanese establishments nearby- could be worth visiting for the architecture related people."
Not what I expected,I went once and have no plans to ever return. Some friends and I went on a Sunday when we didn't have anything else to do and didn't want to go into Seoul. I didn't really have any expectation but I still came away disappointed. It was small and each street was the same. The shops were nothing special and I didn't really see anything that would be considered Chinese. We went for lunch and I had the black bean noodles. It was alright but you can find the same thing in any Chinese restaurant in Korea.
"personally, i don't recommend...","This place is not that hugeand is made up of just Chinese restaurant.The truth is that you can enjoy Chinese food all around Korea.So you don't have to visit here for Chinese food or 짜장면.If you want to know where Korean young people gather for shopping or drinking,visit my Incheon blog. My blog is the only blog about fun places in Incheon.http://fun-incheon.blogspot.com"
What a surprising spot!,"I had never thought about there being a China town in Korea so was surprised to find this place. Being in a port area, it's located on a fairly steep slope with lots of narrow streets to explore. Although the items for sale in the shops are mostly the cheap Chinese trinkets that one can expect in any China town, the real attractions here are not the shopping, but the history.Check out the Jjajangmyeon Museum and the Incheon Open Port Museum in particular. The Jjajangmyeon Museum explains the evolution of this popular Koreanized Chinese noodle dish as well as the 19th century lifestyle and general eating habits of the Chinese of this port area. The Open Port Museum similarly explains the historical development of Incheon as a port in the 19th century. I was fascinated to realize the role of different nationalities in Korea's internationalization during this period. It was also fun to see various sweets being handmade on the street in front of certain specialty shops."
Incheon Chinatown,Small and cheap shops not really interesting. Not much variety in restaurants and really not much to do. Pretty disappointing
It's okay.,"The hills are steep and shops are cheap. It lacks the flavor of American Chinatowns, but it's worth going if you're in Incheon. Fog City Cafe is there. They serve the best sourdough bread in Korea. They have great wine and really good pizza. That's not Chinese, I know, but it's the best reason to go. "
Nothing Special...,The area is quit small unlike what is on the promotions. There are just a few restaurants and that's all! For me it is kindda waist of time.
Korea in the small Chinese,"C1 ( 2013.06.02 )There was smaller than in other country's China Town, but the atmosphere is like in China. Restaurants and shops in red which was China's representative color were located. I enjoyed taste a variety of Chinese food, and felt the atmosphere of China. There was a big wall painted contents of Three Kingdoms which was China's major novels."
Not bad if you are there - but don't travel for hours to see it,It's somewhere to go if you happen to have the misfortune of finding yourself in Incheon City for a few days. Good selection of Chinese restaurants with fancy facia. There are a couple of attractions such as small gardens to sit in but on the whole it's all about eating. At the top of the hill there is a monument to visit to work up an appetite. 
Glimpse of the heritage,"Came here as part of a day tour during the layover. The timing was not quite right, it was a national day, so that many shops were closed that day. But there were few street food stalls opened, so we could feel the pulse of one of the most busy area in Incheon during the day.we could try some local dishes. To me, the food were mostly spicy and lots of noodle variants."
Black Bean Noodles,I ate jjajangmyun (black bean noodles) here and it was delicious. Also the jummpong (spicy hot seafood soup) was great too.
Reasonable shopping,"Good for shopping and Chinese food & no vegetarian food. Shops and hotels open late after noon. Botanical park which is in top of hill is worth watching but steps............ You have to. Chinese culture and buildings and shops with Chinese jewellery , you can enjoy for half a day"
A quiet China town,"a decent China town, but not like the ones ive seen else where... Lots of Chinese restaurants serving authentic Chinese around every alley."
Nice place to check out if you have a couple hours,"Chinatown in Incheon began as a real Chinese settlement, but has since undergone some cosmetic changes courtesy of the city of Incheon, but it's still home to the children of the original immigrants and holds tight to its home flair. If you take the Incheon line (Seoul Subway Line 1) to the very end, arriving at Incheon station, you'll see Chinatown just as you exit the station. There is a huge Chinese archway, it's unmistakable. It was an interesting place to walk around, but be prepared to walk uphill. If you go up the main road be sure to get some bubble tea from a little cafe on the right side. The staff speaks English and are really friendly. Up the main road you'll come to a T crossing and off the the right are a bunch of little food stands selling baked goods. Try a moon pie! They're delicious little pies with a sweet bean filling. Of course you can do your shopping, but it's not much different than what you find elsewhere in Incheon. Take lots of pictures and head up to Jeyu Park behind Incheon!"
A nice place to visit,Incheon's China Town has an interesting history. It is located next to the old port and at the last subway stop. There are lots of restaurants and shops to visit.
Worth an afternoon visit,"My recent Saturday afternoon trip to China Town in Incheon was a nice afternoon outing. There's not much to it really...plenty of souvenirs for sale on the street and restaurants. Lunch was nearly the same as Chinese delivery anywhere in Seoul or Incheon, perhaps a bit better and not too expensive (only tried the seafood soup and black sauce noodles with dumplings) but there were some pricey options on the menu. I also found a small shop that sold a few kinds of Chinese beer I'd never seen, so got one of each of the three. Also some popular snacks for sale on the street.The area is less than a minutes walk from the subway, right across the street, and can be walked through in less than a half hour at a leisurely pace. Up the hill are a few more things of interest, a large, pointy memorial 'thing' for US/Korea relations and a statue of Gen. Douglas MacArthur because of his amphibious landing of forces in Incheon, a significant action during the Korean war (most likely saving the South from being conquered, but I'm not a fan of his, a lot of interesting history there). Overall a nice afternoon if you're looking to get out of the house for something different."
Great place,One of the best places to visit in Incheon. Very authentic and tasty Chinese restaurants abound ! Some nice history to the place too.
