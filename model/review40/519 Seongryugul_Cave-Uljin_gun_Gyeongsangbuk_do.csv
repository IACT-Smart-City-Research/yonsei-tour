Amazing limestone cave!,"It's eight hundrend seventy meters long but opens to the public around three hundred meters. It's solutional cave with columns, draperies, stalactites, and stalagmites, aged more than two hundred fifty milion years old. It has spacious halls and narrow passages I had to stoop low. I felt a bit scary walking trail over ponds. It looks damaged and dried up by many tourists. But I and my kids could have fantasy to be explorers for a while."
