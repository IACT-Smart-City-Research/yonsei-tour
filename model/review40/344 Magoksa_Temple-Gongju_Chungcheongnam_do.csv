amazing temple,"a very interesting temple, worth a walk, the scenery is nice and breathtaking, a place for meditation as well, also the tea is very good taste, no after taste... best"
Extremely rude temple staff. Visit another temple instead - there are plenty in Korea.,"I did a temple stay at Beopjusa temple two years ago and really enjoyed it – I was the only person doing the temple stay and the Monks and the volunteers were all incredibly friendly and accommodating, but then when I decided to do another temple stay at Magoksa temple in Gongju this January I had a terrible experience – the guy that I had been emailing who spoke good English got the dates mixed up and he was on vacation during my trip. When I arrived, the other staff clearly felt inconvenienced by having a foreigner there since I was the only one.When I got there, they kept laughing about a “waygook” being at the temple and making comments at my expense in Korean. I am an expat here in Korea, and though my Korean isn't fluent, I know enough to understand what they were saying.I was ushered into a room to wait with a group of other Korean guests and we were told to wait an hour. An hour passed and gradually all of the Korean guests were taken to their rooms, leaving me behind. I went out to find the Woman that left us in the room and asked her how much longer I needed to wait and she told me I should wait there two more hours! (For what and why?!) I asked to go to my room and she was so huffy about it and kept ranting in Korean to her giggling coworker.They huffed and puffed as they took my pillow and blanket to my room at the temple. Someone had clearly stayed there the night before but they didn't bother to clean it, simply scooped up the old blankets and shoved my new ones at me. I felt so uncomfortable being at Magoksa and I found the staff so unbelievably rude that I turned around, left and got straight on the bus back to Seoul!"
a korean budhist temple established 640 AD,"to reach the main temple we had to walk about 25 minutes on easy terrain shadowed by the trees and along the sound of water coming from riverside of the track.we supposed to be served with the tea ceremony by the budhist monks, but for any reason the monks had to cancel it. it is very interesting to see the inside of main temple, where any small buddhist statues were placed with the beautiful color of wooden painting for its gate and doors .the place is tranquil to meditate in silence and focus your self in your religious belief.I would spend my visit in Korea "
Relaxation with beads assembling.,"There are temple with ,temple stay facilities where may stay people want experience meditation under monk's, guidance ,we were there with group and had experiences of relaxation by assembling bunch of beads,and testing lotus tea."
Korean hiking style,"It's a nice place to come if you're around. The area is big and you can spend the whole day there for hiking. The temple is a little smaller than I imagined but it was nice. The best time for you to come here is in the autumn when all the leaves change their colors. You can take city bus from Gongju from Gongju Central Bus terminal (not the city bus terminal),number 770 (or 700), it takes around 40minutes. When you arrive remember to check the time the bus will depart from there back to Gongju so you can arrange your trip there and dont have to wait for too long for the bus."
If you are around don't hesitate to go there,"It's one of the best temple I've seen in Korea. Authentic and old with a stream around it. I went there in winter but the best time to go there is in April-May or October.The bells are ringing and that makes the atmosphere really special. Entrance fee : 2000wonGo there by car or take a bus from Gongju (공주) then from Gongju Bus Terminal, take Bus 610, 611 to Magoksa Temple Parking Lot (마곡사주차장).Possibility to do a Temple Stay."
Natural Beauty and Architectural History,"This is a great place! I did the temple stay and really enjoyed everything. The hiking was incredible including amazing wildlife and plant life. The river was sparkling and beautiful. The temple itself was peaceful, authentic, and diverse. I would highly recommend this place for everyone."
Nice temple and good hiking,There are several hiking paths near the temple so it is possible to combine hiking with a temple visit. It is also a nice place to do a temple stay. It is easy accesible by bus from the old intercity bus terminal and there are signs there with photos of key tourist sites and a timetable of when the buses leave. To access the temple you cross a stone bridge and walking to the temple from the bus stop there is a panoramic view of the temple. It is one of the nicer temples in Korea.
