Huge number of modern screens on at least three different floor levels,"I wanted to see the first, opening night of ""The First Man"" whilst in Seoul and decided to go to the Lotte Cinema to watch it. The concierge in my hotel made my reservation (using her own credit card to book on line) and I then picked up the ticket at the theatre once having established on which floor my particular screen was located. I tried printing out the ticket from one of the machines using the booking number but wasn't successful. No problem. The friendly young ladies at the ticket desk found my booking and issued my ticket for me.The screen itself was what you'd expect in any such modern complex. Excellent sound, picture quality, comfortable seats with plenty of legroom. The only annoying thing was the constant chomping of popcorn in my ears from all angles."
Big Cinema!!!,"I came here to try their Lotte Super S at auditorium 13, where it already using Samsung Cinema LED Screen. One word: perfect!!! Can't say more as I really enjoy when watching, at that time the show was Pacific Rim: Uprising. Totally recommended."
Lots of options!,"Not only do you have a plethora of choices of which movies to watch, but you can also choose one of the many, many types of theaters! Are you claustrophobic and need more wiggle-room while watching a movie? Then fear not! The Charlotte Theater is available at Lotte World Tower’s theater! This room is quite a bit more expensive than the more standard rooms at W35,000 per ticket, but it’s more of a special occasion luxury. Besides the Charlotte room, there are other large screens with 4D, 3D, 2D and all with state-of-the-art surround sound. Be sure to check out the various popcorn flavors as well! (The Cheetos popcorn was a hit for us!)"
Fantastic help from staff but terrible dank odour in cinema 16.,"Yesterday evening I bought a 30,000W ticket to Lotte World Cinema 16, a small theater in Lotte World Mall. This was to see the February 28th 2017 film of the performance of the Royal Ballet's Sleeping Beauty. Cinema 16 was appropriately air conditioned ans cool but the cinema has an overpowering very bad stink of dampness/mould combined with the smell of a room that has had many people in it with no clean air Ugh!!! I was still noticing the bad smell at the end of the 3 hour film!Prior to the film I sought help from the staff (in perfect English) at the theater information counter on the 5th floor which was excellent. I needed to know the quickest way to get back to the no 8 subway line as I wanted to ensure I caught the last train back to Yeoju after the film. The young lady accompanied me up the the 8th floor, showed me the location of the elevators that went directly to B1 (the level of no2 and no8 subway lines) in relation to where I would exit cinema 16. She also made sure I knew to turn right and follow the signs to subway line 8 when I got to B1. I was very impressed and most grateful for the excellent customer service!"
One of the best ,"Cheap tickets, friendly atmosphere, clean chairs equipped with side tables for convince, wide leg space, my family loved it, am living in one of the most expensive cities and I go to movies weekly but this cinema showed me different experience, it would be nice after finishing the movie to have a snack from small cafe near to the cinema called Azabu, fresh custard pies with cup of hot coffee would make ur day.

Lotte Cinema,Been here like 3 times already. Very modern theater. I'm a movies lover so i may go again in the future
Reduced price for the morning first session,"Nice new movie theaters. Weekday mornings, first sessions are 6,000 KRW(approx.5.5USD). If you have hotel nearby, it might be good local experience to go to local cinema. All movies are sub titled in Korean, over the original sound(It is not dubbed). For kids movies, there are 2 kinds, one for orignal sound with Korean sub, another is Korean dub. If you go with kids, better to check which one is original sound. Weekday morning sessions are easy to get the ticket at 5th floor, ticket box but weekend morning sessions are sometimes full with online booking."
Worth Checking out,"We were tired because we shopped all day and wanted to catch a movie. We decided to see a movie and was concerned because there might not be English movies but there were! A very nice lady spoke decent English and helped us choose our movie, movie time and even ran after us with our change. The price for to tickets for Deadpool was 16,000KRW and I paid with a 50,000KRW and she ran after us with our change. The theater seats were very comfortable and to top it off the movie was very entertaining. For a nice experience in a Korean Theater try checking out Lotte Cinema and you can’t go wrong with the cheap ticket."
A difference experience,i love the wall inside the cinema as they have wallpaper. it is a pleasant feeling and very few people inside the cinema.
standard multiplex,"this is on the 6th floor of the Lotte Department store,so you have to take the lift in the store to reach the entrance.when you get there you can expect more or les the same as your local multiplex,showing roughly the same films.Godzilla was the main attraction whilst i was there."
