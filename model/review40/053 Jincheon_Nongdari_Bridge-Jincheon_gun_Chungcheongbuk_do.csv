Good to poke around...,"...and stretch the legs. Though amenities are evident, they seem to be open only on weekends and peak (summer) season. Nice trails, especially going up to the reservoir. Bicycling is possible (trails lead to and from) and more are accessible if you don't mind carrying your bike now and then. "
Beautiful stone bridge,We went to this bridge early October with some family. They told us it was a very old bridge. Amazingly built back in the early days. Crossed the creek and walked to the lake in the shape of a dragon. My nephew showed it on a map which indeed has a shape of a dragon. Nice place to hike and relax. 
Stone Bridge like wardrobe,"C1 ( 2015.03.13 ) If there was only one attraction Nongdari, I would disappoint. But except nongdari, there had walking area, pavilion on the hill and small stream. There was lake big natural park. I've visited on weekday, so there was not many people and I enjoyed quietly. To the pavilion, it was for 10 minutes. The view of pavilion on the hill was very good, and can feel fresh air."
