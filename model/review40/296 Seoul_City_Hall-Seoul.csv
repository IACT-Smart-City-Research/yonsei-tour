Amazing spot to travel to,"Pretty view, historical place, it's very near to a palace. Visited during the Autumn season, it is cooling and it rained. Recommend to bring an umbrella when visiting as there is not much shelter."
It is downtown,"Very transit of people and motorvehculs, meny way to go best by subway, many atractions has fee, But not expensive, a must,"
City Hall With History,The older and original City Hall was built during the Japanese Occupation in 1925 and served until liberation in 1945.The more modern building to one side was built in 2008. Both are interesting buildings in the heart of Seoul.
Odd architecture,"This is a glass building behind the old city hall.It looks expensive. But, I don't get much architectural beauty.There's a public zone in the basement floor. It's good to visit for an hour."
Interesting building,"Seoul City Hall is not an attraction in its own right, although the architecture is very interesting. It resembles a large glass tsunami. It makes an interesting side visit along with Seoul Plaza and Seoul Metropolitan Library (the old city Hall), whilst visiting the nearby Deoksugung Palace."
Old and new city halls,"Apparently, there are 2 City halls, the new and old. The old city hall is now a Seoul Metropolitan Library while the new city hall, which is next to it, is a modern impressive architecture. They are located in front of the Seoul Plaza, a large open space field. I passed by here on my way to Deoksugung Palace."
Not a required visit,"The new Seoul City Hall is, indeed, an interesting architectural structure -- but if one's time is short when visiting Seoul, a visit inside is not required."
Great architecture,We did not get a chance to go there for long but our hotel was right next to the City Hall square so we passed by quiet often. The buildings are impressive and we liked the vibe overall. Definitely worth a stop - esp when there are performances 
Photostop only,We went here because it is very close with our hotel at myeongdong area. We went here after visit Deoksugung palace. Just for photostop.
Impressive modern architecutre,"The original Seoul City hall became the Seoul Metropolitan Library and behind it stands the new city hall which is a very exciting and impressive modern building made of glass and steel and where the Seoul Metropolitan Government is based. The new building was completed and opened in 2012 and is a stone's throw from several well known landmarks such as the Lotte Duty Free building, the Grevin Museum and the Plaza Hotel."
Seoul's Modern Architectural showpiece,"Seoul has two City Halls, one old and the other new. The Old City hall which was supposed to be built in 1900s has been now converted into a Library. The new one was open in in 2012 and houses most of the government offices along with other Multipurpose halls and cultural centers including Cafes. The new City hall is a multi storied building with glass façade impressing one and all. Visit to this place can be clubbed along with Deoksgung Palace.This place is in a walkable distance from the City Hall Subway Station."
An interesting modern public building,"A new ultra-modern city hall has been built and opened in just the past 5-6 years, and is located behind the older original (and Japanese-designed) City Hall. The older City Hall has now been converted into a library.The new City Hall is located behind, and slightly to the right of, the earlier building, and its sweeping facade appears to curve upwards and almost leaning over the much smaller and earlier building. This IS an impressive building, both from the outside, as well as its interiors, which include a gigantic main wall of glass right across the front of the building, and an internal greenery wall of plants that seems to soar ever so high up above you. In front of the two City Halls (the old and the new...) is the huge City Hall Plaza. This open space seems to be used for a variety of public events, outdoor exhibitions, food expos etc. There was a seafoods suppliers exhibition being held at one edge of the large plaza on the day we visited, which gave us an opportunity to sample a couple of seafood plates.Well worth a visit, and do ENSURE that you don't just view the new City Hall from the outside, but DO go inside and take in the impressive architecture of this building.You could probably spend upwards of an hour checking out the plaza and new City Hall, but if there is an interesting event being held on the plaza then you might find you can spend much longer there."
Don't miss the stone wall in autumn,"The City Hall, just a short walk from the City Hall metro station, is a beautiful building. However, I would like to mention that in autumn, please do not miss the stone wall adjacent to Exit 1 of the station. It is a scenic spot for portrait photography."
Fascinating Modern Building,"As an architecture buff, I found Seoul's City Hall to be a most worthwhile stop. The modern 13-story glass-and-steel building opened in 2012 behind the old, stone city hall, now a library. Designed by You Kerl, the new building resembles a huge wave but borrows from elements of traditional Korean houses, such as the roof structure. Eco friendly, its features include a geothermal plant and rainwater for the cooling system.Home for city government offices, the building also welcomes the general public for free in many areas. I started on the first floor and marveled at the vertical garden that climbs the inner wall to the seventh floor. Consisting of tens of thousands of plants, the garden was the largest in the world when the building opened. Its lower part, which I could see clearly, however, needs to have brown leaves removed. An art installation, ""Metaseosa Seobeol,"" appears just inside the entrance by the garden. Its myriad white balloons represent Seoul's turbulent history, but the creation reminded me of giant grapes. I took the glass elevator to the ninth-floor cafe, where artwork was displayed. Many people sat at small tables, drinking coffee or looking at phones. Two locals invited me to join them and shared many interesting stories about their city and its history.Later, I descended to the basement level's multipurpose space, which includes art exhibitions and design shops. I especially liked the glassed-in archaeology hall that exhibits items from the Joseon dynasty found during excavation of the site. A visitor information desk at this level had an English-speaking woman, who gave me details about the area in general. Seoul City Hall offers a convenient stop for those visiting nearby Deoksugung Palace. The building is at the City Hall metro stop."
"Modern, impressive looking building - colourful at night","The original Seoul City Hall, built in 1925 is an example of Imperial Crown Style architecture and served as city hall until 2008. It is now the Seoul Metropolitan Library. It is completely overshadowed by the imposing new City Hall which is often described as looking like a tsunami made of glass and steel. I was staying at the Plaza hotel just across the square so I saw it both by day and by night in all its glory. And at night it was very colourful indeed, changing colours what appeared to be every few minutes. And by day it seemed to attract all sorts of protesters making noisy demonstrations about a range of mainly local issues. In fact in the week I stayed in this city one gets a very strong impression that Koreans like to shout, wave banners and generally make a lot of noise. Thank goodness that my hotel room had good sound protection. By the way, in the basement of the City Hall are a number of nice exhibitions, some of which I could vaguely understand..."
One of key attractions of Seoul,"This transparent building, resembling a tidal wave, is one of most disputed constructions in Seoul, as it does not blend in with the original city hall building (located in the front, now a library). But still, it is a cool building to take a look at. "
Check out the City Hall Basement floors,"This wasn't on our planned itinerary, and it turned out to be a surprisingly pleasant experience! It was around 6 PM on a weekday, and we had gone in and taken pictures of the vertical gardens, and this glowing light structure. On our way out, one of the senior guards motioned us to the elevator, and told a passing local to escort us to the basement. Upon exiting the elevator, we went out to this floor where photo ops abound! Take a picture with different wall colors, pretend to be ""On Air"" at a studio, look for the ""Lego Wall,"" admire the pastel image-covered lights, and go through a relics exhibit hall! We were only able to explore one floor, but there seems to be two floors of this ""Citizens' Hall."" Wish they promoted this more!"
Stopped by for pics,"We stopped by here to take some pictures in front of the town hall and the ""I Seoul U"" sign. The building is impressive so yes, definitely do the picture rounds here."
"As mentioned before we visited S Korea for more than 5 weeks Seoul was our first 5 days Seoul, E taejon, Yongsan etc.",We were very impressed with the people in Seoul and they suggested that we visit the east coast and the Olympic village there. They are very industrious and technology advanced (Always had internet and cell phone connections where ever we where. 
Photo moment,There is a plaza in front of the building where you should get your photo moment when in Seoul. There were people setting up booths and stage for some event. 
It’s beautiful to walk around ,Love this place so many thing you can do and good place to eat shopping and have a lot cute coffee shop ! To take MRT or Bus in Seoul very easy and fast very safe here I do love this city very much I come every year too
An impressive building !,"The Seoul City Hall was just a 5-10 minute walk from my hotel. I walked by it several times, but never stopped in. Unfortunately, today is a Monday and most tourist attractionsare closed in Seoul on Mondays and so was the visit of the City Hall. Hence, I could only see the lobby area and got my self some documentation. The 'Tong Tong Tour', a Self- Guided Tour, looks very interesting to me. It goes over most floors of the City Hall. I will certainly do this during my next visit!"
You either love it or hate it. I didn’t love it.,"Very unusual curved glass design. I didn’t care for it at all. Not from any direction. The smaller former city hall, now a library, is immediately in front of the new City Hall, There is a large grassy area in front which is used as an ice rink in the winter. You can also take a picture sitting on, or in front of, the S E O U L lettered sculpture, facing the City Hall. 2 Metro stops 1 block away."
Impressive architecture,It’s worth taking a detour to walk past the new City Hall. Which stands imposingly behind the old much smaller city hall.The architecture is extremely impressive and the curves are spectacular!Not much to do there apart from admire the building!
Their garden is closed,"[More food and travel journey on my Instagram @oppakuliner]When I visited here, i wish i can take a picture and sit on their small garden. But unfortunately it was closed on that day, so just take a picture on their city hall. It's just okay experience"
Sightseeing ,For the first timer travel to this city.. Starting from the first landing at Incheon... Clearing an immigration and custom.. Quite a procedural SOP which have to fulfil as most typical traveler like Asian kind.. Where have to take some of the groceries from local produce as a typical traveller would not survive with the food at the countries which they landed..some strict rules of food preparation by the landed state... Where it may prohibited to take them. No other way.. Bring some of the local ingredients and bring along some.. And declare at the customs what have you brought in.. List them.. And you are allowed to get in.. Accept for the past 2 visit.. Sydney and Auckland.. Where Auckland seek to see what you have brought in.. Go one by one... Seoul.. Know your culture well and the procedure seem look efficient... but unfortunately the counter for KAL Limousine to get to City Hall was close at 9.30 pm... My clearing at the airport at 10.39 pm.. having no choice.. Get a International Taxi... 65000 won at Region 2 of your destination.. Right in front of your lobby..Moving around City Hall.. advisable to move around with subway.. Get a T Money and load the amount of your required amount as the local at 7~11 suggested put a value of 10000 won for your usage as long as 3 days.. And also.. How often you move from one region to one region... Subway makes your mobility at Seoul.. Efficiently and do not hesitate to open your soft spoken skill to ask the station worker.. If you look lost.... 
Make sure to rent a Egg Wifi and download SEOUL SUBWAY the result will be easy,"near subway and very clean city hall. make sure to have pocket wifi for easy travel, Seoul City Hall was our drop off after DMZ tours (we booked via KLOOK apps)"
Futurism meets nature: architectural delight,I am a huge sci fi and futurism fan and loved this building and architecture. It could be out of an Interstellar-esque space station. Despite it being very cold outside the inside feels like a warm garden. The lush plants and clean crisp architectural lines make this a photographer's paradise. Take the glass lift up to the platform where the coffee shop is to get an excellent view.Stunning and a must visit for architecture and sci fi fans. However note the art gallery supposedly on floor 7 appears currently defunct/neglected.
Awasome!,"When we try to explain Seoul City Hall, we have to consider other components. The location of the City Hall is perfect and if you like walking you can find temples, museums, sculptures etc. around there. I highly recommend to go there guys!"
Superb Architectural Design...Pleasing To The Eye!,One of the best architectural building in Seoul. We went to see the building up close & personal on a Sunday morning. Very nice building with walls of foliage & looks like a glass building from far. A picture perfect place for tourist and architecture lovers!
Stunning architecture,"This building is a world class architectural building. Indoor planting is superb, walls of foliage. Marvellous forward thinking, Seoul is an architect's delight. Stunning buildings throughout this spotless city where planting and foliage profligate."
Architecturally pleasing,"Seoul City Hall is an amazing building that is architecturally a marvel to look at. Seoul City Hall was built in 1926. There is an open green area by the City Hall. Various events and festivals are held here. It is also a nice place to have a picnic. The Seoul Plaza is a very significant historic site. It is also serves as a gathering place for football fans – as was the case during the 2002 World Cup that was jointly held by Japan and S. Korea. There is a monument with a clock counting down to the winter Olympics of 2018 in Pyeong Chang. One of the attractions of Seoul Plaza is the Floor Water Fountain, which looks like a normal sidewalk but shoots water up very high from the floor when you walk across it. The 48 floor lights along the grass square and Fala- a round type outer wall clock- are other attractive features of the Square. The Fala, in particular, is designed to ring the Boshingak Belfry sound at high noon everyday. The Floor Water Fountain presents a grand sight with 35 underwater lights.Admission is free"
Interesting Building,"If you like glass buildings, you will like this place. Its across a park and is basically an archetictural gem."
Modern City Hall,it is a bit surprising to see the glass building of the new city hall behind the old city hall at Seoul Plaza. Last time I visited Seoul it didn't exist. City Hall area is consisted of several buildings worthwhile to see around the Seoul Plaza. This time Seoul Plaza seem to be a festival area during the Chuseok. But there is Deoksugung Palce and related park. Seoul Museum of Art is nearby.
Really cool architecture ,Super modern building. Great outside architecture. Inside has a vertical garden. Very modern very Seoul. Definatley worth checking out. City Hall metro station 
Am I in a City Hall or What?,"A reflection of how Seoul wanted to make the city modern, globally competitive and environmentally friendly. This place is a must see!"
Living Building and amazing to see,"Unlike the Hadid building across town, this modern building is active, alive, and has heart. From the greenery in the lobby, looking upward to the very weird orbs, this place screams fun. In the basement was a very active space, with a fair, food area, and best of all, a really well done archeological dig that we really enjoyed. We just walked away feeling good about this place."
In the city centre,"Very modern building close to the square, where you can enjoy free concerts in Summer, you can enter the building and have a walk on the ground floor, the top floors are for staff I think. The admission is free."
Old and new in one,"The city hall consists of both the old building and the new building (just behind the old building). It is open for visit, though I did not visit the interior since it was close at the time I wanted to visit. There seems to be different exhibitions going on most of the time reflecting the different Korean arts and culture and history. Entrance is free."
Pretty Amazing,"Wow !!! Who knew a municipal city building could be this visually stunning. Impressive architecture. Nice snack shop on top floor lets you sit and enjoy the views. But, the secret wonder is the basement with its Gungisi relics. You can walk over a glass floor and view the site. Plus, there is a Korean Tourist desk located by the exhibition hall with very helpful staff."
Symbolic ,Seoul City Hall is an eco friendly building with unique exterior. The Green Wall is the most popular attraction at the Seoul City Hall building. The vertical garden climbs up the inner wall all the way from first floor to the seventh floor.
More than just a city hall!,"Honestly I had planned on going here just to get a photo with the Running Man cast in the second basement. I didn't realize the place itself was just amazing! It's really more than just a city hall. It was modern, educational, fun, and just full of stuff to see and do, for adults and kids! It was connected to the subway so it was very easy to get to. There is an area where they had protected some archaeological finds that was seamlessly built into the building. It was just fantastic! I wish all city halls were like it!"
Fabulous!,This is one hell of a city hall. Captivating! Quite unique in style and design. You'd think it is a shopping mall from the outside.
You must visit the City Hall!,"The place for the citizens, tourists, young, old people. You discover the happiness of to be at Seoul, the service logic of Koreans. Don't miss to visit!"
Great city hall,"It's a big city hall, the interior looks unique and modern. And it's a good spot for photo at the front of the building."
Great piece of architecture ,If you are into your buildings then come marvel at this wonderful and unique design. The green square makes a great foreground for photos. Close to D palace.Thanks for the vote if you found this review helpful.
Stunning archictecture!,The seat of power of the metropolitan city of Seoul! You can't miss this building when you are in the city centre. Its imposing architecture lords over the surrounding building in the Seoul Plaza. The building looks stunning from whichever angle that you are admiring this building from.
Like other city halls,Big area constructed with modern art and also you can find items from Histrorical Seoul and history of Korea
Great architechture,"I love this building. Stunning architecture. Its location is great with the green spots nearby. A good ""I love Korea"" spot in front for photos."
old and new together,Great building. The combination of old and modern is perfectly balanced and goes well together. Very creative architecture.
Beautiful,A most beautiful building arcitecture speaking.the building is a green planed and a visit in the building is a must. 
Old meets the new.,Come to take an exterior photograph. Amazing how the old and new sit well together. Around outside the space comes alive. Very easy to reach by metro. Railway station worth combining a visit. 
It's a city hall,Really not that much to see. The architecture is nice but not the most extraordinary I've ever seen. 
Interesting contrast,It's a very interesting contrast between new and old city hall building. Really worth going if you have some time.
Pretty nice,Worth a look and walk around if you are in the area or staring your way to the Gwanghwamun Square. Pretty original architecture. There are a couple of flyers for a self-guided tour. The underground part is also nice with the fare trade shop and coffee place.
City Hall Of Korea,"Not So Good, just can take 1 picture and just near Deoksugung palace, nothing else to do in here so if you go here just after from deoksugung palace still ok"
Lots of Demonstrations -,We stayed at the Plaza Hotel which faces Seoul City Hall...March 2017...lots of political activity with the impeachment of the President and all associated protests...walked past the city hall - great to cruise by to get a sense of the environment.
Vertical garden is a must see!,"The building is partly old and partly new. The new part is very interesting to see as it has a large vertical garden inside the building. You can just have a walk around and go up to the rooftop garden from where you have a nice view. You can decide yourself how much time you spend there, so just go in and see for yourself."
Eco-friendly building,"It is just a office building. It is one of Seoul's landmark, is an eco-friendly building with the world's largest indoor green wall. There is a big lot right in front of the city hall. Sometimes they use it for different kind of outdoor events. The city hall is right across street from Deoksugung Palace."
Intriguing,"Located right next to the previous City Hall building that makes up an interesting sight of the combination of modern and old. Very intriguing building in the heart of the city, suggesting that Seoul is ready to look forward even if it doesn't always materialize in daily life. I can't actually provide more information about their services but I definitely suggest checking out the building from inside out."
"Cafe closed, green wall open and see basement","Come to city hall to have a look at the ""Green Wall"" which is one of the largest vertical gardens in the world. Also there is a cafe at the top which we wanted to visit but is currently closed (will reopen later in year). Under the city hall you can see the excavations when building the wall and they discovered the footings of old houses."
Very modern building,"City Hall new building is in a modern design, actually futurist design, and inside the old building which part of it remain in front of the new building there is a public library. Outside of the old building the clock also remains there. "
Very unique shaped modern building in Seoul,"We were picking up our city bus tour tickets nearby. We saw this building covered with mirrored windows while walking on the opposite side of the street. Very large, modern building in Seoul. It was a cool day in October 2016."
Honeymoon @ Seoul City Hall,"We had a early morning walk pass Seoul City Hall.It exhibits Korea's culture and all.There are shops selling souvenirs. Just outside the building, there are tents setup for ""rebel"" on Fri and Sat. Parts of the roads will be closed."
City Hall,"Nothing too special. I've been to the Seoul City Hall many times throughout my life. In my opinion, the new building they added a few years ago just doesn't look right. It's a cool modern building but it doesn't look in harmony with the older buildings. The Seoul City Hall is not the same anymore. During the winter, they have a ice-skating rink and they decorate the area with a huge Christmas tree and lights. They also had an open market a couple years ago which had many booths of food and gifts to buy."
Nice modern building,"The title just about covers it, worth stopping to look at whilst passing, but don't go out of your way."
"Been there, done that","City Hall is the same wherever you are in the world. It is an administration centre. What's unique about this place is that the old building has been converted into a world-class public library, and that a brand new architectural building is being built adjacent to it. At one stage, it has the world's tallest vertical garden but it still looks rather impressive. There's a visitor's lift that takes you to the 8th floor where temporary art presentations are being held from time to time, and that you can walk up the stairs to the ninth floor, where there's a café, and where you can have coffee meetings with your colleagues overlooking the city of Seoul. At the basement of the new City Hall is a small public stage free performance is being held there from time to time. Overall, there's a sense of blandness about it. Still, if you haven't been to Seoul before, you might want to see this for yourself. Outside the Hall is a large field where a lot of huge of demonstrations are being held."
It is a city hall.,Interesting architecture and you pass it when you go to several sights around. Nothing special though.
Modern architecture next to the old City Hall in Seoul,"This is where everythings happens right next to Plaza Hall, Westin Chosun Hotel & Lotte Hotel. People voice their opinions whenever they want about why they are upset. It became a habit, tradition, passion to voice loud what people wanted to be heard. It can be annoying for traffic or some noise. Koreans are use to it. But I don't know about the visitors. It's a beautiful place of Seoul, the heart of Seoul, but also a place to avoid at times. This is the state of Korea, Seoul in this century reflecting its good & bad, the history, the anger & angst as well.  "
City Hall,"This area feels like the center of the whole city. Beautiful building. Hotels, temples and resturants around"
"5mn from home, been there so many time","great place to hang out with friends, picnic possible in front of the building, many events happen there, check website. "
Nice,"Good building to check out, if you catch it once per day you have a free english tour, but you can follow their proposal and do it yourself, the vertical garden inside is nice and the while building is very interesting.It is free attraction.Have a coffea on the 5 floor of the library as there is a very nice garden terrace with a great free view of the center. "
interesting place,Right in the city opposite major shopping centre. Interesting building and worthy a photo. A nice big oval in front of the City hall with market as well in certain time. 
Interesting architecture with an interesting story behind it,"You could just as well look at a photo, nothing to do there, but look at the odd shaped building and hear the story of why it is that way. But, again, it's sort of obligatory, before you are liberated to just walk around an look at local shops and restaurants. "
Stylish building,"Very modern building near Myeoung Dong. It is locates next to Seoul Library which is old style building and therefore, creates very eye catching point for photo."
Eco-friendly building,Discovered the vertical garden upon entry. It was fascinating to look at and there were gardeners pruning leaves. There was a food exhibit while we were there highlighting food waste in today's society which was a good reminder to not to discard food that is misshapen. We also went down the steps outside to make a small donation. The steps light up and play music as you walk on them to donate money to children paraplegics. 
Festive area of town,"Impressive area for buildings, festivals, entertainment and gardens, we spent a couple of hours wandering the area. It is a great starting point for a walk up to Gwanghwamun Square."
Amazing architecture,What a mix of old and new architecture. Both interior and exterior are worth seeing and photographing. Located right next to yet another palace in Seoul...
Nice to see if you are in the area,There are many events that occur in the front of City Hall. We just went last week for a Street Artist Festival. The event was fun and the building is structurally very pretty and unusual. 
Good place to be worth visiting..,"C1 ( 2016.07.29 )There was modern style beautiful building in downtown as public office. This building's underground had rest area, museum, library for citizen. If you visited downtown, recommend to look around this public office. There had not classical mood different with Europe's old office, but modern mood was not bad."
Incredible glass building,Fantastic art takes the shape of an all glass tidal wave building eclipsing the old Japanese built city hall
An awesome city walk-around!,"On our last day of our Korea trip, we had a couple of hours in the morning before the pickup service to the airport, we decided to maximize our time by exploring the city hall of Seoul.As our hotel is located within reasonable walking distance to the city hall, we decided to explore the place by foot. So after our breakfast at our hotel, we embarked on a walking trail.As we walked along the streets, we were amazed by the different buildings here in unique designs and architectural themes we encountered and the greenery lanes that the city hall has to offer, a good segregation between commercialization and nature that impressed us. It's so relaxing and soothing to be able to be near to ""mother nature"" in a busy, crowded bustling city! It's a good place to experience Seoul and immerse in it.If not of the limited time we had, we would love to walk and see more here. On our way, we also came across bikes rental booths and perhaps another good way to explore the place is via cycling!"
An amazing structure,We had a few hours to spend so went to see the Seoul City Hall. It is an amazing structure both inside and out. The plant walls were astonishing and the wave formation of the entire building as it casts its shadow over the old city hall is striking.
good area to relax and view seoul,"We visited the City Hall area to relax, walk on the grass and view the busy Seoul streets. This is a popular place for meeting persons. There was an art exhibit titled ""the peace of the world"" which used bombs, bullets as the basis for displaying figures that were based on hope and recovery from war.The City Hall building is unmistakable, and shows the modernity of Seoul. this is in stark contrast to the Deoksugung palace which is on the opposite side of the grassed area. The City Hall is actually built on what used to be the palace grounds. I found this an enjoyable place to stroll early in the morning and listen to the sounds of Seoul waking up. In he summer, the sprinklers are sometimes turned on, and children enjoy cooling off here."
"Interesting, iconic building","This is apparently not beloved by all of Seoul -- however I say good job for building something that is unusual and iconic. Remember, the people of Paris hated the Eiffel Tower when it was built. "
Must do in Seoul! ,"Amazing place! You get to see seouls past, present and future with fantastic views, libraries, amazing architecture, amazing cafes and a public space designed for the citizens of Seoul to converge."
Cool building,A quick and nice stop on my way to see the Palace - very modern design and it was beautiful at night time.
Stunning structure... even more dramatic at night,Beautiful setting of a park with lawn and space for festivals and gatherings. Dramatic sweeping lines of glass that is lit at night so it looks completely different than the perspective you see in the daylight.
Cool Building,There's not much to see other than a cool building that's shaped like a wave. Take some pictures and wander on by. Sometimes there are protests outside of here which can be interesting but other than a picture it isn't worth a special trip.
Modern and picture-worthy,"The place should be a good addition to someone's downtown walking itinerary. Take a quick stop to admire this modern, tidy, and aesthetically pleasing structure. 15 minutes is probably enough as there's not much to do inside the building. "
beautiful and cutting-edge architecture,This building is worth a look as you walk to other Seoul attractions (it is doubtful you would miss it). It is modern and beautiful. It is a good place to start your walk along Cheonggyecheon Stream (a nice place to relax in the heart of Seoul). 
Seoul City Hall,The new Seoul City Hall captures the modern archetecture theme very prevalent throughout the city. The facade features a huge screen and rounded glistening curves. The city has preserved Old City Hall which is located immediately adjacent.
"Very modern, a piece of art","If you have any free time, should visit this place. The location is close to the big palace. Very interesting."
Pretty but don't go just to see it,If you plan to see something in the area then have a look at the City Hall but don't go just to see it unless you have spare time
Glimpses and Turns,"We did not expect that we will be passing by the City Hall. Though it is understandable that this establishment is a busy one, it turned out to be a different one. People were still in the calmness of their hearts while going or even passing by the City Hall! Truly a juxtaposition of nature and modernity..."
Interesting,Curiosity got me into the basement building - and it's such a surprise to find activity halls open to the public. 
Rolling Glass wave - Stunning,You can see this building from quite a long way away. It looks like a big rolling wave made of glass. If it is a sunny day be sure to take your sun glasses for the reflection is dazzling.
Seoul City Hall,Located at walking distance from my hotel and City Hall StationMust visit for touristsOld Hall has good architecture and grand look.
Interesting,"The old and new city halls are worth a short stop on your way through the city center. The new one is quite spectacular with its internal gardens and spaceship architecture. In addition there are exhibition at ground level and basement (some archeological remains in the foundation of the building), however the latter seemed to be the target of numerous visiting groups of classes that made the place quite noisy! Anyway a quick look only takes a short while and is easily made on your way to anywhere around."
"Located in the city , the building have strange shape,",We passed this building several times.During the night its illumination changing colors every couple of minutes.Together with its strange shape making it a nice landmark to see.
If you are from an Asian city- this is a superb stopover,"A vibrant indoor public space for rest, recreation, sale and interaction for the whole family. Easy to stroll around yourself and look for the wave like blob of the whole building behind the old city hall as well as the piano key staircase right after the Citizen Hall exit."
Unusual looking building,"An usual building, and one you probably won't miss, as it's almost opposite Deoksugung Palace. There's a metro station underneath, so it's not difficult to find.Worth a photograph - I took two!"
"Wow, what a surprise!","By a series of fortunate errors, I ended up spending over an hour at Seoul City Hall. The building itself is fascinating with sweeping glass, interesting art installations and all sorts of other things happening. This was not on my Seoul ""to do"" list but I am so glad I went."
Where the old meets the new,"It truly was a delight to have signed up for the free Tong-Tong Walking Tour of the Seoul City Hall. What a remarkable feat of architecture to have joined the old building with a new and very modern building. We were told that in order to complete the construction they had to dig a basement to adjoin the two buildings and for the entire duration of the construction, the old building was ""suspended"". The old building is now used as a public library. The new building houses the Largest Vertical Garden in the world (as recorded in the Guinness Book of World Records). When we were there we were also able to enjoy a relic museum and a free janggu show at the basement. During winter, outside the City Hall is an ice skating rink too.Overall, it was a morning well spent."
New and old in the center of the city,There are old and new buildings around the City Hall which is very central district in Seoul. There was an icing ring when I was there. I actually walked to City Hall from Myeongdong.
Look for ice-skating rink in winter,"cheapest ice-skating I've know. 1000won/hr and this includes skates. Coming from a tropical country, this would be considered a large rink."
A few interesting things to see at the Seoul City Hall,"Seoul City Hall (free entry) is located upon Seoul Plaza in the heart of the city. Here you find two buildings, the old City Hall which now serves as the Seoul Metropolitan Library and the new and modern City Hall, which is of a contemporary design and structure built in 2012. In addition to seeing the unique architecture of the building, there is a self-guided tour of City Hall which includes a few interesting stops. First, you can see the tallest vertical garden in the world which spans seven stories up the inner wall of the City Hall building. The self-guided walk also takes you up to the 8th and 9th floor Sky Plaza and exhibition gallery. There are a couple of cafes in this area as well. You then descend into the lower levels of the building where you find building ruins known as the Gungisi Relics, an unexpected find at City Hall. Additionally, there is a design shop, more art space and open lounge area. There was a duet performing a few Korean tunes during the time of our visit. That was neat to watch for a few minutes. Overall, we enjoyed our short visit to Seoul City Hall. This is not a major attraction but a neat place if you enjoy unique architecture and peculiar attractions like the vertical garden located here. Note: You can download the Seoul City Hall Self-Guided Tour map. It can be found through google search and is available as a PDF file. You can also find the the map in brochure form within the City Hall building."
Cool area but the City Hall didn't seem like a site to actually seek out to visit (but the location is very central),"I don't think the City Hall is anything to seek out to see, however it is very central and is on the way to many sites worth seeing, and has its own Metro stop that serves as a good starting point for several worthy sites around it. "
Nice architecture,We visited this place because some recommended it. We tried to check whats at the 9th floor as it is recommended. You can only take one elevator going up. Unfortunately the art exhibit was not yet ready during our visit. We just passed by since its near the palace. Nice architecture but nothing special
Walking by,"We just walked by the city hall on our way to Deoksugung palace. So many events going around the city hall, so the area was decorated beautifully. We don't enter the building, but decorations outside it are enough to make it a great photospot. It's beside the Seoul library too, so you can stop by in the library without any fees."
"Bustling place, modern architecture","You can reach this area through the subway. From this access you will get to see the Seoul Plaza, Seoul Metropolitan Library which used to be the seat of Seoul City Hall before and the new building of the City Hall. The new structure is beautiful and looks like an inspiring modern municipal building. Unless there is a particular cultural event or nice outdoor activity a busy traveler may just want to settle for the general impression and a quick walk through the area."
Nice but nothing special,"I was there 2 weeks ago. Nothing is special expect the location which is good. In front of the building was paint exhibition/displays. I noticed that they have an anti homosexual movement just next to main entrance. Cheers,"
Nothing much here. Don't waste your time visiting.,"As my title reads, nothing much here. Don't waste your time visiting. Not even worth to come here for photo taking."
many surprises event held in this place,"i come here at weekend, and surprisingly there's music performance held here!. i dont know if they had it before.i just found out that they have different attractions here. a must place to visit."
The Green building in City Hall,"Seeing a green building up close is like dreaming of a future filled with hope and order. While the glass and steel facade can stiffen the building , the moment you get inside and see the vertical plants alive and green , plus some art installations, you get to see the balance of a building that is well thought about and designed. Another must see and visit in Seoul downtown. "
Great outdoor space,"Seoul is a city well used by it's citizens and the outdoor space at Citi Hall always has something on offer. On a recent visit we were lucky enough to come across a great drumming and Tae Kwon Do show on the Saturday night and by mid-week there was a farmers market, complete with refrigerated butchers vans."
City Hall is a city hall,Akward looking glass building with hefty heating and air-conditioning bills paid by citizens of Seoul. It is annexed to the older part of the city hall. I gave average rating only because it's got a beautiful Christmas tree and ice rink in winter. Not a 'must' but a short visit would not hurt since it is not too far away from other attractions.
New is not always better,"Modern Design, not matching for my taste the city picture!The Old building look better! Too much glass! "
Beautiful ,You should definitely at least see it and get a picture when you're in the city. It's beautiful and very unique. It's very picturesque!
"It's worth your time, just to simply breathe the lobby air.","The New Seoul City Hall was opened to the public just 3 years ago on August of 2012 and it shines as an amazing e-building on many levels. Depending on the time of year and the outside climate, the rush of the clean air made by the thousands of plants on the walls will knock your socks off. I have almost always seen a public display of art and culture on the ground floor, so you can take in all this wonderful air. There is an observation lounge for the public on the 9th floor where you can meet and drink nice coffee. There, you'll also notice how much attention was given towards recycling energy. Gas lined windows, solar panels, the naturally climate controlled environment, and more. If that doesn't impress you, make your way to the Old City Hall that has been renovated to a public library. Four full floors of public library space is a heaven to thousands of citizens daily. If you can find it, you can snap an impressive selfie while governing from the Mayor's Desk~! Oh, then there's the museum that showcases some impressive remnants of Seoul's past. Lastly, make your way to the deck and you'll me able to view the New City Hall from the best vantage point. Oh, there is history over the choosing of design and some significance of the structure itself (something about a wave, not Hallyu) but that's on another page. Easy way to spend about a good 4 hours. Enjoy~!"
"Unique design, both out and inside.","I stumbled upon Seoul City Hall during Christmastime and was pleasantly surprised and quite impressed with its architectural design, both inside and outside. During the winter, there is a ice skating rink right in front with tall Christmas tree which could be romantic, but also fun for kids.Inside, there are sections that are strictly for workers there, but there are also many areas for the public to visit. When you first step in, there is an enormous wall of green vines faced by the glass wall of the building. There are some hanging bubble-like sculptures that light up at night. Quite beautiful. There are some artsy shops and cafes and a bookstore inside. There is a sci-fi-looking video wall where kids can play some video games. There is a miniature museum that shows an excavation site (I think of what they found maybe beneath the construction site of this city hall? Can't remember...) Apparently, there are free concerts from time to time (I didn't see one, but I did see the small stages and seating areas). There are some interesting looking conference rooms that are quite grandiose. It's actually quite hard to describe as it is such a mix of everything.I would like to eventually return when I have more time to explore it more fully or to even take a tour of the building."
City hall Seoul,"Close to Myeongdong. Events at night on some night, close to stream. Nice structured, most tour end/ drop off point."
Impressive architecture,"Enjoyed walking around the architecture of this building, and the huge vertical garden. Small art gallery upstairs."
Wonderful ,A truly wonderful peice of architecture Its location to downtown is perfect. Its green idea is so cool
nice hangging garden,"the city hall got a new buildings with hangging garden inside, lovely. and we just enjoy from the lower ground to take some photo shot. there's an art and beautiful architecture. outside the buildings you will find soccer lap for demonstration area."
Nice ,Great location and nice to spend 45 minutes. We loved the combination and integration of the old city hall with the new modern glass structure right behind it. 
An extraordinary building,"If you like modern architecture this building is a must. Not something that we had planned though we were elated for the experience. Beautiful architecture, central sculpture and and vines climbing/descending 7 floors. "
Not your ordinary City Hall,It honestly doesn't look like a City Hall due to its fine architecture design. Hope i was able to go inside.
sky garden cafeteria,"lovely place, but summer days, bit hot...recommend winter time "
Interesting Building,Take a quick peak inside the City Hall Building. There is not a lot to see here but make sure you take the lift to the 9th floor and then walk down to the 8th floor.
Pretty Big building open to public,"The buildings are wide open for pulic. The old building is now a public library, the new one has indoor square where you can observe/participate in lots of community activities. It also has cafes and souvenir shops of course. "
Seoul's soul,"Hello friends, when you visit Seoul,South Korea make it a point to take a leisurely walk around Seoul CITY HALL,it is easily reachable by TAXI,bus and metro train lines number 1 and 2.The OLD City Hall , a Victorian Like structure building and the new modern 21st Century Jazzy Shaped Glass looking like a Theater stand side by side. In the front are large open SUN WARMED spaces- a public Ice Skating Rink,UNICEF Tent Pavilion and Cafeteria.But what impressed me the most is that a LOVELY red & white color model of an EAR named YEOBOSEYO in Korean which means Communication! The message to public is loud and clear that ""we CITY Councillors are Listening to Citizens"". Good Luck."
Big and well located,"The city hall is located nearby many touristic attractions of Seoul. The building is quite big and imposing, in the way you can't miss noticing it. When I visited an ice skating rink was being built right in front of it. The square was also well decorated for Christmas."
Gotta love the architecture!,"While the building itself was not open to the public while we visited the area, the architecture of the building is simply superb.The usage of glass (and I mean a LOT of glass) in the building gives it a somehow futuristic ""feel"", but certain elements bring it down back to a more classical style.Try to visit the place after dark, too, as the atmosphere of the building changes dramatically with the lack of sunlight."
Interesting building ,The Koreans are not any about trying to build architecture that stands out and this building is representitive of that. Love it or not it certainly catches the eye. 
Audacious building in a great neighborhood,"The Seoul City Hall is the perfect harmony between history and modernity. The Renaissance-style building has now been supplanted by an ultra-modern wavy glass building. The buildings are linked by a catwalk, full of symbols. There is also a great plaza that is often used for large events, and where you can gather easily. Sadly you can't really ""visit"" the buildings themselves, but that shouldn't deter you from checking out this area. Plus, the neighborhood is also home to the DeokSooGung palace, the Seoul Museum of Arts and the Lotte Department Store."
Amazing Architecture,The old City Hall is incrusted in a large modernistic glass and steel building. It stands out. It reflects the wealth and the good taste of the people of Seoul. It did not hurt that I saw it on a bright sunny day. Excellent access by metro and bus (incl. tourist busses). 
Seoul Centre,"city hall in seoul is centre of shopping , activities and eating traditional Korean food . there is metro station with same name so very easy to getting there , city hall reminds me shinjiku in tokyo ."
Unusual architecture,"Town hall are almost fully cover with glass and unusual architecture. Get off at Town Hall metro stop and short walk you can see this building. Cannot go in. but from the outisde it is enough to see the workmanship of the building. Very different. Look like a giant wave over, Interesting building to look at and on the ground is fully grassed area where people walk on."
Beautiful architecture.,The architecture of this building is very interesting. There are always concerts or similar events in its yard. It is good to check the place from time to time.
Good to see,"Went at the wrong time, it was a Korea national holiday, so this place was closed. We still had access inside which was fun and was able to see quite far out."
Very cool building,Amazing modern building in the heart of the city. I would say it incorporates we'll the spirit of this city and it inhabitants. Great photos.
Dynamic city,"I'm fairly impressed by the beauty of Seoul, a combination of tradional characteristic and modern beauty"
Like no other city hall i have ever seen,"My local town hall is an elegant 1920s listed building.,Quite the opposite to this building,which in every way reflects this bustling city.I cannot recall another city hall quite like this,You cant miss it as it is in the centre of the city"
Such an interesting building in the middle of the city,"MUST SEE! check the inside out as well, its really interesting with greenery hanging off the inside of the building, its actually a really cool place - apparently there is a cafe there as well, we didnt go as we didnt have time"
Awesome modern building,"Beautiful building, didn't get to spend much time in it but what I saw was amazing. In the basement there is a big display on how they built it and kept the old building."
Creative Mix of old and new,Seoul saved the historic front of the old former historic city hall and encased it in a shell of glass that is extremely artistic and modern. Open and light filled interior is friendly and inviting. A delight to look at from all directions. I was concerned that the beauty and history of the old building would be lost but this is a creative and delightful blend of old and new. Great place to visit in the heart of Seoul!
Seoul makes a statement,"See the old city hall now converted to a library. Go inside the new modern city hall, which is a green building. Go up and there's a nice cafe and a small museum. Take a quick look and see how Seoul is making a statement."
"Modern buiding, amazing fauna","Very modern glass building, surrounding area is very looked after too, amazing fauna & beautiful Deoksugubg Palace park next too it."
Ice skating rink during winter,"We went to the city hall to try ice skating for only 10,000 won! It was a fun experience since it was my first time to try ice skating. What I liked best is that the rental includes helmet and ice skates already. There is also good music playing in the background making the experience truly memorable. There are also nearby comfort room. This place is very accesible by train."
Very cool to see,This is pretty cool to see. The old and the new. They have a beautiful Christmas tree in the front and ice skating rink.
Very nice architecture,The city hall is an impressive piece of architecture. Further more there are a lot of activities on the place in front of the city hall during the week-ends. Next to the place is also the Deoksugung palace very nice to visit in the evening and which often host nice activities.
open clean space,Walked to city hall as there was a festival going on...an open clean space and you can sit on the grass...if no attractions going on..not a special place..
Sunday flea market at City Hall,"On weekends during Summer, this place is crowded with families and children enjoying picnic and playing by the fountain. There is a flea market on Sunday, selling lots of books just in front of City Hall building. Alas, most of them are in Korean language."
