Beautiful Mall with an impressive LibraryWe visited Starfield Coex Mall on a Sunday noon in September 2019 .Upon ste,"We visited Starfield Coex Mall on a Sunday noon in September 2019 .Upon stepping into the mall, we were so so impressed by the huge library which is located right in the centre of the mall. There is a mammoth collection of local and foreign books and magazines and the tall huge walls are lined with books as well. The library is very spacious with many seats available for reading and browsing pleasure.Besides the amazing library, Starfield Coex is a modern mall with everything shoppers need for fashionwears & accessories and services for all ages and also plenty of dinning choices.Understand that within this hige mall, there convention halls, cinema and aquarium. We didnt explore much as we were heading for other destinations given our short stay in Seoul.It is a beautiful Mall and l would love to return for another visit for this is a place to make me smile , especially the lovely iconic library ."
Fun place to shop with friends and family,"Lots of shops, restaurants and art to see. Easy to get to from train and genuinely just a good time with friends and family. "
Special feature:library,"It is not just a Mall and a big shopping center with a huge food court but it also features an architecturally interesting library. With Free entrance, people could just walk in and read books which were just line up on the shelves. There were chairs and tables around the place. Many people were coming not to read books but to take photos of the place as it is very popular for tourists."
World Mall,"This is a world class place with convention center, shops, aquarium, numerous restaurants and an airport check in for many airlines. You can spend hours here. "
SM Ent & Starfield library,"if you are a kpop fans especially SM stan this place is a must list to visit because SM COEX ATRIUM will give u an experience to get close to your idol, inside SM there's museum, photobooth, merch shop, cafe or even auditorium. and Coex Mall is really nice to look around also the most iconic there's a library inside mall with amazing decoration and huge scale of bookshelf . U can also take a pic in here."
"Connected, lots of choices and family friendly","The mall is great. Modern, lots of good shops and restaurants. Well connected to the metro and bus stop. The library in the center of the mall is a great place for pictures. There is an aquarium attraction which is great. It is also connected to the Hyudai Department Store, Intercontinental Hotel and SM Town Museum. As a family traveler, we appreciate the baby room which had all the facilities we needed. They had changing tables, resting area, nursing rooms, baby cots, and baby feeding area. Very thoughtful."
Coex and the amazing library Starfield inside,"Starfield Library is something very special! Thousand of volumes, magazines from all over the world, even magazines for interior designers, gardens, e.tc, from France and Italy, are all in the disposal of the citizens without any discriminations. It is worth it to pay a visit. You can buy or borrow (inside) the library, everything you might have in your mind. In general, the huge store Coex is available for your entertainment as for your shopping."
Nice mall with beautiful library ,Love this mall as it has nice shops with international and Korean brand. Very crowded on weekend and the beautiful library is also the main attraction. The Hyundai hall is a good place to start to hunt for food. You can easily spend your day here. 
GIANT LIBRARY!!!,The mall is very huge. The good thing is. I came when Korea Great Sale was happend. and i was really amazed by the giant library!!!!
Huge Mall,"We stayed at the Intercontinental COEX which is connected to the COEX mall. Very convenient. The mall is huge and you can find all the usual shops such as H&M, Zara, Uniqlo,....lots of food choices as well. Great food hall where you can get great deals after 7 pm. Definitely a nice way to spend a few hours. "
Nice mall,This is more upmarket mall next to SM town and Starfield library. It has lots of different shops - great place to hide away from The summer heat. It also has restaurants serving different food with a cinema 
"COEX Mall, everything is here","The best place to meet colleagues in Seoul is COEX Mall, everything is here. We ate in a great restaurant, beauty products were all on sale here, kids had a wonderful time playing, and the big plus is the huge library with books everywhere. I wonder if they had English books there.I was here a few years back (2015) but the changes took me by surprise. You could spend all day in this place. Coffee shops, restaurants of all types were here. Shopping for souvenirs and clothes were all in one place. If I had time, I would have liked to visit the aquarium and SM town but I was on a tight schedule. Thank you my former students for meeting me here and seeing the gigantic library full of books. It was a great stop for me while I was in vacation in this country."
Western mall in Asia,"Coex mall is pretty much Korea's version of the mall in the states. Not just western designer such as Zara and H&M, but the layout is not your typical Korean style mall. Building is long instead of tall. I do recommend to come here at least once for the amazing library design. Stores are ok but the library has amazing layout with gorgeous backdrop. Also a good place to come if it rains."
"We stayed here at one of the hotels, which was a great location!","Staying at a hotel at COEX was great- we had lots of food choices, and several things to do on our doorstep. The COEX library was beautiful by day and night, we bought souvenirs at the aquarium, and even saw K-Pop stars that did an autograph session at the mall one evening. Special shout-out to Papavalley Pizza, which was utterly delicious. If I were to add some things to this mall, it would be a couple more places serving a hot western breakfast."
"COEX Mall, Seoul","COEX Mall seems to be the largest mall in S Korea. It has got everything from what I see ..... from clothing and accessories stores carrying domestic/international/designer brands .... I like shopping in Aland. Lots of restaurants and cafes inside this mall so whenever you're hungry, there's something to eat for everyone. It has a large cineplex with a total of 17 screens, the COEX Aquarium, the ASEM Plaza and the Event Court. The Starfield Library inside the Starfield Coex Mall is impressive with thousands of books and hundreds of seats. The library is located right in the middle of the mall, but it’s not your average quiet library as it's bustling with students and people having a fun day in the library."
Nice fast train,Took the KTX train Seoul to Busan. The train ride was fast but only on few occasions did we touch the 298 km/h mark. But it was nice and thrilling enough 
Fantastic public library in the middle of the mall where you can read any books of your choice,"Excellent place for many quality stores for clothing, traditional Korean goods, dining, occasional small concerts, art shows, etc. Starfield public library in the center of the mall is a must place to visit."
"Huge mall with everything, easy to go Incheon Airport","This shopping mall is huge with a lot of shops, department store, aquarium, duty free, casino, subway station, library, etc.The best is you can check in here for your flight. Stay near this mall if you need a convenience place for shopping."
Loaded Mall,"While the daughters were touring the SM COEXartium to get their fill of SM kpop, we enjoyed wandering through this upscale mall. Both Korean and International stores were located in this large, modern mall. Food options were plentiful and many looked trendy and inviting. A huge library was located in the center.For more Kpop things, we went outside the mall to see the massive Gangnam Horse Hand sculpture inspired by Psy's Gangnam Style song which was viewed over 1 billion times on youtube."
Great for Spontaneous Shopping and Eating Out,"Really good underground mall with numerous shops and eating joints. The shops are mainly of democratic brands like Armani Exchange, Zara, etc. Lotte Duty Free is also there as well as an interesting bookshop and Kakao Friends store. The complex also encompasses an aquarium, a movie theater and a library."
"Go for the library, some stores are fun too","It is huge and it is very very easy to get lost. So honestly check out the library and then some local stores, because otherwise it is a large mall with a pretty good food court."
The library area was amazing,"Not all libraries are quiet spaces. In this area there are huge walls of books right in the center of the mall. It makes for a perfect picture opportunity but also an opportunity to read books, socialize, or relax. Attached to the mall are many shops and restaurants and at the opposite end there is the aquarium."
Huge underground complex,"The world's largest underground mall contains numerous retailers, as well as the huge Starfield Library. However, if you want to come out into the light of day, be sure to cross the street to explore the Bongeun-sa Buddist temple and enjoy the unique Hyundai Development Company headquarters, Tangent."
Library at Starfield COEX Mall,"Being tourists in Seoul, we went primarily to see and take photos of the huge library inside the Starfield COEX Mall. And, indeed it was huge, and photo-worthy. The mall is also accessible by subway train. And for these reasons, I give it 5 stars."
If you Like Shopping ,"Then this is the place to go.Loads of nice shops, plenty of places to eat and drink plus all kinds of attractions including a library and an aquarium!"
Great way to spend a rainy Sunday ,"Lots more to do than a typical mall, including a movie theatre, aquarium, library, and every type of food you can imagine."
I like the Coex Mall,"I normally frequent several of my favorite stores there.This mall has all of the stores I wanted all in one place. Daiso, Pierro Shopping (competitors to Daiso), Butter store for specific items I want to buy which we don't have in the U.S. "
Nice Place to People Watch,"The library was huge and very nice! But almost all the books are in Korean so unless you know Korean or bring your own book, it’s simply a place to sit, relax, and people watch. There are also cafes and an E-Mart inside the library."
My Saturday Mall,"I walk here at least one Saturday each month, to shop at No Brands and The Hyundai stores, eat at one of the many restaurants, pay my mobile bills at the SK.Premium store, watch a movie at Megabox, have a smoothie from Joe & the Juice and walk around for a while looking for sales in the myriad of other shops in this large modern underground mall. Definitely worth a visit and it's easy to reach by bus or subway. "
Gangnam Style Sculpture,"COEX mall is an upmarket underground shopping mall. Having been to several shopping malls before in Asia and Europe, the place did not excite us. We did not spend a lot of time here. The main reason we come across this place is because of the Gangnam style sculpture which is located at the eastern patio of this mall. It is a bronze sculpture of two fists/hands overlapping each other just like the fists motion of the gangnam style dance.We took a lot of pictures with the sculpture on the background. "
Huge mall with plenty of walking space,"We came here to visit the library. A good mix of restaurants, fast food, food court, local and international brands. Love the Copenhagen flying tiger and Butter which offers creative and innovative home decor products. "
Shop relaxed,Seoul is famous for its markets but you can have a more relaxed shopping experience in Coex. I'm not much into fashion but I can stay for HOURS in the home section in ALand. It's got a huge collection of items from Flying Tiger Copenhagen which I love because they're fun and funky and oh so cheap. The food court offers a wide range of choices too!
Big mall with library ,"If you are into mall tours, this is the perfect place for you. It also has a library and the Gangnam style statue outside the mall...Nearest subway Samseong station."
Great Mall,"Located in the busiest territory of Gangnam district, this mall is huge and there is an enormous library/book store and an aquarium."
Big Mall.. has pretty much everything!,We were staying near by and visited the mall frequently for shopping and dining. Great mall. Super clean. Lots to do and see. 
Beautiful library,"Went to this mall because I wanted to take photos at the library. There are lots of shops here - pharmacies that sell beauty products, my favourite store Aland, Innisfree, bookstore, cafes, aquarium etc."
Big underground mall with lots of shops,The underground mall is a great place to go during the winter months. There are plenty of stores to browse. My favorite park is the public library inside!
Lots of walking,"Given this mall is spread so wide, it will take much walking to cover the grounds. You will find all your known brands inside. They even have an aquarium but will need entrance fees @ 28k won to enter. Lots of restaurants and cafes as well."
Perfect Modern Mall,So if your in Seoul and in the Gangnam gu area this is a mall you should visit. These are my reasons:1. The mall has very different and unique shops available 2. Neva seen a Library inside a mall and it's so huge and the you won't be disturbed by the sound of the shoppers outside. There is soft music heard in the background.3. Had a LOTTE duty free inside (things are steap but if Ur brand conscious - not a bad decision to visit then)4. Fabulous Aquarium inside the mall. This Aquarium is HUGE. Even better than the Ripley's aquarium at TorontoThe food options is also good enough for all kinda traveller's.
Great place to relax,If you are in Seoul definitely come by COEX and spend a day or afternoon. There are great restaurants with a variety of international cuisines which is great if you need a break from Korean food. It is a nice place to shop and browse for gifts as well. Make sure to check out the library which opened a couple of months ago. It makes for great photos!
Huge!,"It is really the largest underground mall in Asia!! Despite being so large, signage are well placed & very clean mall."
Everything,This place carries a cheap dollar store as well as foreign and Korean brands. It has an area to get souvenirs. Picked up some great Korean shoes and clothes. I feel the prices are very comparable to the States but way better quality. The library is great to see. 
The prettiest library,"The prettiest library I’ve ever seen! This library located in the middle of the COEX mall. The library is lovely and in a quiet environment, very modern design! "
Whole block underground mall,"Under the building at Coex area, Intercontinental hotel, CALT, Hyundai department store, etc. There is a very big shopping mall that you can find almost everything, also with (small) duty free shop This mall you can walk trough any building around, in winter, it's good to keep warm inside this placeAnd also many food shops and restaurants there, enjoy!!"
Huge underground shopping mall,"The mall can be reached via 2 subway stations, Samseong and Bongeunsa. Can walk straight via underground into the mall. With many retail shops, F&B and SM Town (a 6 floors k-pop museum), one can spend hours in here. Special mention to the brilliant library which is a must visit. It’s an open concept."
I Love Coex Mall,"We have limited time visiting Korea but we made sure to visit Coex. We visited Coex near closing time so we went straight to the library. I love the library, it is a good place just to rest and read. I can spend my entire day here. I will surely go back here."
A must see!,A great place to eat and shop. We stayed at a hotel connected to the COEX which made it very convenient/an adventure when we looked for different restaurants for our meals. They have a really interesting library in the middle of the COEX.
Good place to shop,Big underground shopping mall with lots of things to do. A lot of restaurants to choose from. There’s also a food court which we tried out. The highlight was the library. A must see! 
"Huge mall, amazing library","Coex is very huge mall with lots of shops, restaurants and entertainment places like cinema, aquarium etc. However the best thing about this mall is the amazing libaray in the middle of the mall. If you tired after lots of walking at the mall, you can relax at the library even though most if the books in Korean. Shops are ordinary, nothing is unique and most of them is Korean product. "
A really great shopping mall,"There's quite a lot to see here, full of shops and restaurants and even the beautiful Starfield Library. It's in a great area, close to many cafes and restaurants and even close to Bongeunsa Temple so to me, this is a must see mall and area."
Beauty & the Beast Library!!,"If you have seen the movie Beauty and the Beast, you know the scene where the Beast takes the blindfolded Belle into his library and then, upon removing her blindfold, she looks up and all around and sees this library that stretches as far as the eye can see in all directions. THIS is the same library! I am sure of it! Perhaps it was the inspiration for this portion of the movie. Come to COEX Mall just to see the library and you will understand what everyone is talking about! I loved seeing entire families sitting there together with books. I was amazed to see children off all ages, sitting in nooks against the window panes, reading. How wonderful of Korea to have inspired so many children to enjoy the simplicity of curling up with a good book. A real, actual book, not a tablet or a computer. A paper book to hold in their hands. I hope more countries will be inspired as well."
come and take whatever you want!,A place with everything what you want! And the most spectacular ‘Starfield Library’ is the highlight herer.
Dubai,"One of the best shopping malls I really enjoyed it here , everything in one place and the ResturAnt's are good"
Amazing Mall!,The library made me dream. The most amazing place ever. I had never seen any library like it in all my travels. I had to visit this place three times because I couldn't get enough and it was worth it. The mall had many stores. You could shop to your heart content. There was also an aquarium and great restaurants.
Not much to see,"It is a pricier shopping mall with mostly high-end stores. The library is interesting, which holds live bands, frequently."
Great shopping more rather unwieldy to venture,We love going to COEX Mall and seeing it's ever-evolving range of clothing and food stores. The library is an amazing photo opportunity for the savy tourist. We found ourselves constantly walking in circles and getting confused direction simply because of the size of this place. It is a great mall to visit!
Visit,"Great Place to shopping.many products with many promo and disc also.also the library, it's really cool "
Size does matter,"Housing the largest underground mall in Asia, this place served as a great respite from the blistering 2018 summer heat. You will find plenty to do here - there is even a library! There are also plenty of familiar names for shopping. Having come here with the family, my wallet was very much lighter when we left!!"
HUGE!,Huge and packed mall! There´s something for everyone. Also great for buying fun souvenirs or toys. Many coffe shops and restaurants. You can easily kill many many hours in here. Dont forget to visit the peaceful bongeunsa temple right next to the mall.
Watch out for lunch time,"Great things about this Mall1. The library: beautiful2. great collection of stores3. has a aquarium, great for kids4. easy to get to by subway(via line 2 green line)However, you need to watch out for LUNCH TIME. All the restaurants are packed with hungry lunch goers, you literally have to wait in line for everything. You can't even find a seat at the cafeteria. It's just that busy. So my advice is eat early or eat late, just don't expect to walk into a restaurant around 12:30 and get a table right away."
The library is amazing,Specifically visited here just to see the Library within this shopping mall!! It was wonderful to be surrounded by so many books and so many people reading!! The glass roof is a great addition for those studying below. I'd love to know how they reach the ones at the top!! 
Luxury shops,"The stores are really expensive, but you can find cheap stuff if you're determined. The food court is breathtaking, the variety is huge. There's even a supermarket part of the mall, with kind and helpful employees. The library speaks for itself."
great mall,"The mall is underground, and very wide. The building that you saw, a part is SM TOWN, and others maybe offices or places for exhibition. Because when we went there, there was baby- something -exhibition. Inside the mall there are cinema to watch movies. But, since we thought the subtittle would be in korean/hangul, we decided not to watch movie there. But the place is so nice and big. there is arcade games; cafe; also marvel shop and it's quite complete. There is big aquarium too. But we decided not to go inside. We got there already night. shame. But most of all, I really like to go to SM TOWN. Hahahahaha... eventhough I only sight seeing, but it was so amusing. Must go there for tourists who are fans of KPOP!"
Large and efficient convention centre,"This huge convention centre can host several conferences in parallel. It is so large, that one can easily get lost (also due to limited availability of indications inside)."
Worth seeing,It’s a huge underground mall with many stores selling so many things and some restaurants. Worth seeing if you’re in Seoul. We did not go to the aquarium or cinema so cannot comment on those. A typhoon was expected the day we went so it was wet which may have accounted for the crowds.
Pretty library,"The awesome library allows you to take dozens of fantastic photos and make sure you are able to stand out among instagram, "
Nice library ,"Worth a visit just to see the library. If you are staying in one of the nearby hotels, it's a good place to walk around in the evening. "
Came here for Starfield Library ,"Specially traveled here to visit the library. Not very huge, but definitely worth taking some nice pictures. Also dropped by the SM museum and aquarium since I was already there. Had a quick lunch at the basement CJ foodcourt. Limited options and food was alright. "
Popular,With the locals even on a weekday. Not sure if it’s the season but most of the Brand are on sale. There’s a good mixed of local and foreign Brand. Good place if you’re looking for fashion and cosmetics.
Shopping Haven,Awesome place to visit.Many shops and nice food. Always has something going on. Great atmosphere to walk around or relax.
Great shopping mall experience,"This shopping mall is easy to get to via subway, and offers a comfortable shopping experience with international clothing brands and a few trendy korean brands. If you are looking for a lower price range of clothes or unique korean designer clothes, this mall is not recommended. But be sure to check out the starfield library which is a very famous photogenic spot!"
Mall with coex aquarium and SM Town,We were looking for the coex aquarium and found out that this is where it is. I dont see any sale except this is where the cheapest fon covers can be bought and i regretted not buying. And also the receptionist can speak english well so when you’re lost try asking. This also close to SM Town. And their book shop/library is the highlight it was too huge and it’s good take some photos!
Huge shopping mall,"You can find everything you need here; foods, stuffs you'd like to buy or cinema. Also museum of K pop stars. ;-)"
Its just a mall ,"Its really nothing special, and just a mall! The library in the middle is really lovely, but not worth a special visit. There are lots of places to eat, and western food available, but very busy due to lots of offices nearby. There is an aquarium inside, but lotte mall also has one, and I would recommend Lotte world mall over Coex (I have not been to either aquarium). Really nothing special, and not worth going our of your way for. But still a handy place to grab a coffee or a meal after visiting nearby Bongeunsa."
Go to Mall,"This is stunning mall, the big dashing design libraries and equipped with high brand clothes and food, there also kimchi museum, my planned to korea 2nd time is not to explore mall but my “new” friend tag me along to her ittn so i was amazed with this huge mall. "
Lotte DFS Shopping,"Dropped by the Lotte DFS COEX for a quick Prada shopping. was able to get a 10% discount using the Lotte VIP gold card. you can apply for it at the entrance as long as you have a VISA signature card. As Prada is not a local bramd, you can only collect it at Indheon Airport on the day of your departure. For local Korean brands like their skincare and cosmetics., you can collect your items on the spot"
Visit this Shopping Mall,"Visit this shopping mall that has different shopping experience as also several well known Korean and international fashion brands and home style shops .There are several restaurants and cafes in the mall not to forget a magnificent public library in the heart of the mall.It also houses banks .The mall opens 10.30 a.m. and closes at 10 p.m. Customers can visit by Line 2 at alight at Samseong Station Exit 5 & 6 and Bongeunsa Station Line 9 , Exit 7"
Beautiful library,"This mall has an amazing core library and that’s all, it has the same shops than any other mall, and for instance uniqlo has fewer clothes or Kakao friends shop is smaller than others. So if you are going to stay a couple of days in Seoul it doesn’t worth a visit "
"unique mall, not only for shoppers but also for the ones who love reading books","it's a must visit shopping mall, we can find something different from any others, when shopping mall and a library as one. very instagramable, take picture right at the library or the mega popcorn at the mega box cinema, I bet you won't regret it."
"Huge Mall, a winter escape","A great place to get out of the cold in the winter. It can challenging to get here from the city center in a taxi (especially when it is snowed and rush hour), so the metro may be best way to get there. Lots of food options and shopping. The library was very cool. "
Amazing Indoor Place,"This mall is the most interesting place, if you are planning to visit Korea in freezing day or scorcher. Simply said, this place provide everything in a just an area, shopping, sightseeing, theatre, eating, hotel, and even aquarium. it's really huge so please beware of using information centre or electronic map in the mall. Additionally, the mall is connected with Sam-sung station (in line 2), so the first-visitor will not be struggled with finding a mall."
Asia’s largest underground shopping mall,"It’s a nice big mall with lots of shopping, food courts and a n aquarium too. Many international & local brands can be seen,. Outside the mall there are many food stands with long queues"
Large mall with lots of varieties of food,"Large mall with lots of food types. Connected to samseong coex station & can be easily covered. Lots of shopping, spacious & Asian, Thai, Korean foods are available."
A Mall for Kpop lovers,"If you are an ardent Kpop fan, this is one mall you wouldn’t miss going to. An entire section is devoted to promoting the Kpop stars and their merchandise. There is even a cafe there. For the rest of the mall, there is a huge library with floor to ceiling bookshelves that can take your breath away. The shops there are extensive and it is linked to the Hyundai Department Store that has about 8 floors for the shopaholics to satisfy their shopping cravings. "
"Large, busy, easy to reach, not very dpecial","Covering the underground of a huge block (under COEX, hotels, office buildings), there is a large number of mainstream shops, several food/restaurant courts, a two-storey library - except for the restaurants and the shoppers you don’t get a specific Korea feeling here. Prices appear also to be slightly higher than in traditional shopping areas."
Big mall with a cool library,"We only visited here for the Brick Live Lego shop. During our short visit, it seems the mall has events at their exhibition halls. In addition to restaurants, there were McD and other fast food joints. Mall is connected to the Seoul metro."
Mall got a pharmacy and doctor office!,"Family and I came to this mall for shopping on the recent vacation. A member of the family got stomach issues from bad food for several days. Finally could not wait any longer so we stopped by a doctor office for medical attention. All we paid was about $20 for doctor visit(in the state it could cost hundreds without insurance), the clinic look very professional, inside the doctor office there are medical instruments(high tech and low tech) all around. After consultation, doctor prescribed medicine that we got at a pharmacy next door, very convenient."
huge mall,"huge mall with plenty of things to do (cinema, aquarium, library, shopping, cafe, restaurant).shopping wise is not the go to place. But intersting library design worth the visit."
Great Library but don't go out of your way to go here,The library was amazing! But to be honest I was pretty disappointed by the shopping. We went out of our way to go here after reading so many reviews but didn't find anything special or exceptional shopping wise. Anything you can find here you can find and Lotte Department Store or any other shopping area. Worth a visit if you are close by.
Amazing Mall in Seoul,"Starfield COEX is a vibrant underground mall which offers visitors an amazing diversity of experiences. There is a beautiful library which radiates an aura of serenity in the busy mall. Authentic cusine from Turkey, India, Thailand and range of Korean food and fusion food. The mall is linked to the exhibition halls which can be accessed easily on account of the excellent signage. Prices are reasonable and the mall offers very good value for money. A must see, must experience mall. Five stars from me for ambience and feel good factor. Amazing Korea."
The coolest library ,"Coex is a huge mall in Gang nam, seems like it has everything including the coolest library. Can you imagine a library in a mall? Worth a visit to take photos!"
Wow huge and nice library,"The library is very impressive with nice design and many books. We took a lot of photos there. There are many people reading the books and having a cup of coffee. There are many shops, restaurants there also.It is nice to visit this place."
Huge Library ,We went there to see the huge library. It was on the ground floor in the COEX mall. It was “MUST SEE” spot. There were many people who actually use books. I wished if I could have read Hangul. 
Nice,"Large mall, variety of shops and brands, with a great library. Different restaurants with halal options. "
Large underground mall with lots of shops,Found an under 10$ store here and bought a lot of items. It's an underground mall. Very large and easy to get lost. Has a fantastic library here and an aquarium 
Waste of time,This mall in gangnam area and it far from my Hotel Lotte city.In my opinion this mall is waste of time nothing especial and you can not compare it with lotte department store.It too expensive.This place is good for meeting not shopping.In fact this place was huge mall before change it.I will not come back
Large underground shopping mall near gangnam gu,"This mall is nearby to gangnam gu area. Its a huge underground shopping complex which is a part of much bigger coex convention centre. The famous coex aquarium is situated within this mall. This mall has many entrance gates. It remains open till 10 pm (some of the shops start closing at 9:30 pm) after that only the restaurants remain open till 11. Many of the good restaurant s too close by 9:30 pm. So its better to visit this mall early in the evening. This mall houses many local as well as international brands. It is also a good place to buy some souvenirs though it will be a little costly. There are varieties of restaurants serving different cuisines of the world. One can get Korean, Japanese, European, Italian, American, Indian & Mediterranean restaurants there."
"Great Mall, Great Food","there are some great places to eat in here. one of the neatest book stores i have ever seen. we stayed near the mall, worth the visit if it is nearby."
Fabulous Mall!,"After visiting SM Town, we visited the COEX mall next door and decided to grab lunch at one of the many restaurants located inside. The mall is massive: there are lots of stores and restaurants that we didn't have time to check out. What I liked about this mall was the underground passage that connected to the mall. We were there during Christmas and it was snowing, but due to the underground walkways we were able to cross to the other side without any difficulties from the weather."
BEST SHOPPING MALL IN SEOUL,"best place to shop in one location - much better than meong-deong or dongdemun. Has some most major stores, an aquarium and a massive library/attrium. Foods, shops, cinema. Massive area."
Disappointing,"Yes, it is large, but the walking areas are very broad and the stores are big too, so there weren't as many shops as I expected. Overall I found it to be sterile and uninteresting. I had a much better shopping and people-watching experience at the Lotte World Tower and Mall place."
Clean mall full of chain stores,"So, this is a mall, and it has lots of large retailers. There's an aquarium (separate listing) and a cinema, and it is across the street from a temple, and has its own metro stop, but it's not really worth a visit if you are coming from somewhere that has average large retail stores."
Huge and nice place.,"A different interior from the usual mall. I like that wherever you came from, there is an entrance/exit nearer for you. And finding a library in the center of the mall, with awesome placing of so many books, is so great."
"Nice Mall with lots of eateries, stores, aquarium and theater.","This clean and well maintained mall is located right off of The Samsung Subway Station which makes it very convenient to get to. We went here to bring our 2 boys to the Coex Aquarium which is located at the other end of the mall.This mall has such stores as Zara, A-Land, NIke, Under Armour, Levi's, American Eagle Outfitters and many others. Also there are over 30 different restaurants to grab a bite at. This mall also has a huge ""Starfield Library"" and a movie theater called The Megabox. You can also access the Hyundai Department Store, The KITA Trade Tower, 7 Luck Casino, Lotte Duty Free and The Intercontinental Hotel from here. This mall can also be accessed from the Bongeunsa Subway Station as well."
Great variety,"We went to the COEX mall mainly for the aquarium however the shopping and food outlets provided extra attraction. The mall is easy to get to and is very modern. The food court offers a good variety of Asian cuisine but many individual restaurants are available of different culture. The library here in the centre of the mall is the biggest ever. Such a large variety of shopping, you are sure to find most things here."
"Huge mall, lots of services","The beauty of this mall is the Information-- very good command of the English language. Helpful for travelers who are looking for things, or are lost. It offers the usual things a mall offers: good affordable restaurants, clothings stores, bookstores (with English books), etc. It's also connected/located to CoEx, to Oakwood Premier, to Hyundai Department Store, to Parnas, the CoEx Aquarium.Not sure until what time the place is open (or if it closes) but we did a quick run to McDonald's late at night and passed through here from Oakwood and back."
Not the greatest mall I've been too,The mall is okay. Can be confusing. Was very tired afterwards. Couldn't do the aquarium as it didn't take our card and we didn't have enough Won on hand. Overall stores were experience compared to American stores but we new that going there. Restaurants were very diverse. Not the greatest mall I've been to.
Clean and well-managed shopping mall,"C1 ( 2017.04.13 ) I visited this shopping mall because I want to buy some books. There had many facilities like restaurant, shop, book store and theater, etc. Many brand shop and food court was operating, too. All was good with good atmosphere, but there was confused because of complicated load. Need detailed road sign, I think."
"Large, No anchor stores, need 10,000 steps?","Coex is a great place to get your 10,000 steps in for the day. Shopping is uninspiring. No anchor stores. There is no organization to the placement of the stores. I would go there only if I've exhausted all the shopping options in Seoul."
Didn't like it much! 😕,Ok I wouldn't call it the hidden gem of Seoul . The shops are expensive and I wouldn't have even visited the place if it weren't for a meeting near by. The duty free Lotte mall attached to it demands not only your passport but the return e tickets before letting you buy anything.. so if you want something from there keep the required documents with you.
HUUUUUGE mall with an Aquarium and lots of restaurants,"I am not huge fan of malls, but I had to go check out the COEX Mall. It is really big and you can easily spend a whole day there. There are several options for restaurants - western food too. Between the COEX Mall and the Samseong station is a big hands monument in honor to Gangnam Style song by Psy. It plays the music and you can see the video clip in a screen. Since you are in Gangnam why not take a picture there? You can either get off Samseong station from the green line (2) exit 6 or Bongeunsa station from brown line (9). "
Large but boring,"A large mall between the 2 intercontinental hotels, and linked to the CALT airport bus stationMiddle tier and quite boring. Some global brands like Zara, little known ones like dyptique, and many local brandsQuite difficult to find good food also"
Big mall,Located at gangnam district. Very big mall has an aquarium on the bottom floor and many shops if u like shopping it's heaven.
"EXTREMELY huge mall, so many things to do including an aquarium!","On one of the days we had in Seoul, my boyfriend and I decided to check out the CoEX mall because we saw cool pictures of it in a brochure. Of course, it is a very touristy spot that can get crowded at times with tourists, haha, but we spent more than 5 hours there! It's so big that my feet hurt from walking at the end of the visit but we were able to see the aquarium (very unique and ~21 USD), do a VR roller coaster ride, play arcade games, shop for 40 mins, eat ramen, check out their architecture, and eat the best green tea ice cream! Shops range from buyable for the average middle class person to luxury brands to souvenir shops to random trinkets! I suggest getting a map! Definitely enjoyed the visit minus the insane amount of obnoxious tourists but definitely fun if you like aquariums, shopping, people watching, arcades, movies, you name it. It's underground so perfect during hot or cold weather days."
Back to COEX in almost 15 years,"My first time to Seoul was in 2003 and one of the so called tourist spots was COEX. Haven't been back to Coex for almost 15 years since my last visit (even I have been to Seoul many times after 2003). Good to see that Coex has changed to a better outlook, it seems so new to me."
Largest underground mall in Korea,"Everything on one level all underground, it will keep you from turning in an icicle when the weather outside is unbearable. Big Åland store here if that's your thang."
"Nice mall, but, quite large","We went to Coex 2 evenings in October 2016. One night we we to check it out and for dinner options. There are so many restaurants. It was a 7 minute ride from seongsu station here. The mall is 2 levels, but there is a mini level by the aquarium hidden in a corner with eateries there too. Very bright and clean looking throughout. Many clothing stores. There is a large good court too. Also, a movie theatre and aquarium. Aquarium was very good on the other night. It closes at 8 pm with ticketing ending at 7. We got lost trying to find our way back from the aquarium one night, but discovered the food court which had lots of seating and some nice options. Here we ate bulgogi and noodle soup with galbi short ribs."
If you like shopping and food then it's heaven ,"I am not a fun of shopping but the size of the mall is overwhelming. Located in center of gangham style, it provides a lot of things to do. Has an aquarium on the bottom floor and many famous brands to shop from. It is pretty pricey but it is expected considering its location (gangnam). Would recommend to see it, even if just for a quick stroll throughout the mall (still might take an hour). "
Extremely large mall ,"It is a large shopping mall. Suggest you check out the flow of the traffic and understand reach one end to the other. There is an acquarium, cinema, amusement park, supermarket and lots of coffee chains. Definitely a nice place to spent a cold winter or extremely hot summer. Take time to browse through some of the stuff which is Korean unique. Avoid the office crowd from 12-2 pm. "
Too big and too easy to get lost,"Sure there's a lot to do, and there are plenty of places to shop. There are festivals and clothing stores and restaurants and an aquarium and movies and and and. It just goes on and on. It's hard to find your way around with the curving non 89 degree angle turns. THere are info booths with English to help you find stuff.It's just a bit daunting. Give yourself plenty of time to walk, to get lost, and then to find the subway / bus / exit you need at the end."
One Stop Shopping,"This mall is so big even our taxi driver got confused trying to drop us off! The layout is daunting at first, but just keep walking and you'll be pleasantly surprised at the flow of the massive space. We found a healthy variety of common western brands and unique local ones, from luxury goods to discount stores that sell cell phone accessories. Similarly the food options are numerous. A whole day is barely enough to enjoy all the shops and amenities of this shopping complex. It's conveniently accessible via subway too!"
Huge mall with SO much to do!,"It's busy, expensive, and has everything you might ever want at a considerably higher price than you'd likely find in pretty much any other country in Asia, but if you have that European or American ""itch you can't scratch"" this is the place for you. They also have lots of great restaurants and don't forget to visit the Aquarium and KPop Museum (if that doesn't make your ears bleed). "
My favourite in Seoul,This mall has it all:- Affordable brands on clothing.- Duty-Free on cosmetics.- Lots of choices for food.- Entertainment for all ages.- Subway stations just below.- Several hotels.
Numerous Brands,"Its a Huge mall in Gangnam district, mostly high end items available. Can spend a whole day shopping here, many coffee and pastry shops."
Huge mall,"This mall probably has everything you need from home goods to little cute things that you can find in Korea. They are currently in process of constructions and more stores to come in. It's a great place to hang out, shop and eat. "
Gigantic mall,"A giant mall in the Gangnam district with something for everyone.Ranging from local products to high end products, a cinema and an aquarium.Coffee shops everywhere and a huge variety of places to eat.Information desks spread everywhere with helpful staff that speak many languages."
huge but easy to navigate,one big long mall! lots of redundancy of vendors. huge. fun. easy to navigate. connects two hotels. nice oasis.
big but confusing layout,"visited here since it's one of the biggest malls in korea. wasn't really too impressed by the shopping. but if you're an SM fan, there's an SM Coex Artium area which has a shop (usually packed with fans) and all sorts of other things to do. Also there's a city airport on level 1 that has a money changer that provides pretty decent rates."
Overwhelmingly huge!,"This is a gigantic mall. You can find all the big name Korean brands as well as American and European brands as well. Super fun to go with the family, so many the escalators, the kids should enjoy it. Plenty of food and resting areas as well."
Review,excellent venue for conference. really enjoy it and would like to come again in the future for any upcoming events thereexcellent place !!
Too big mall ,"It's the biggest underground shopping mall in Asia in the coex building. One of greatest aquariums connected to the coax mall, exhibition, convention center, intercontinental hotel, casino & movie theater etc. Line2, exit8 of seolleung station."
Coex mall ,We took Gangnam station line 2 to reach coex mall. It takes around 7 minutes. The mall is too big and quite. Many restaurants are there and you can find Halal too. Many famous brand you will find with Korean brand.
Very posh and high end but really beautiful!,"It's a really huge mall. It's so easy to get lost inside it. But everything you need is here. From Korean and international clothes and cosmetics to food and services. This mall is in the same building as the exhibition halls so it's really convenient if you have an event to attend since you can just walk around while waiting. It's also connected to the City Airport so after checking in your baggage and going through immigration, you can go around the mall while waiting for the bus that takes you to either Incheon or Gimpo airport."
Such a big mall,"This Coex Mall is very big to explore, they even have aquariums and place for exhibitions. Coex Mall is a high end mall located in Gangnam area. Not so much to talk about this mall, other than those special features, this is just like a normal mall with expensive things. Try to walk around, inside and outside the building cause it has such a nice design."
Wonderful,It is a very big mall you can't finish it at one visit. Very unique shops there. مجمع كبير جدا لا يمكن إنهائه في يوم واحد. يوجد به العديد من المحلات الفريدة. 
My Seoul trip,"One of the interesting places to visit in Seoul is the COEX Mall.I would say don't miss it. The best way to get there from the city center, if you are taking the subway, is to take line 3(the orange line). Line 2(green line) will also take there, but line 3 takes less than 25 minutes.Take line 3 to Seoul university station and then take line 2 to Samseong station.Whenever you get out of the train look at the station and vicinity map posted on the platform to see the closest exit to the mall. As you enter the mall, make a right and you will see the information desk and a virtual interactive map of the layout of the mall.Check this out before you start exploring the place. Check the various restaurants and the food court before you decide to eat. Believe me, you wouldn't want to miss out on some of the best food in Seoul, all under one roof. Also check out the various retail shops, just browse, even if you don't buy anything, this would be an interesting experience. Once you are done with the mall, check out the area around the mall. There is always something going on.When I visited in September, there was a free K-pop concert ( Korea Sale Festa) going on near the mall."
Touristy,"One doesn't see how big Coex Mall is from street level. A large part of the mall is underground and it is huge. Thus, wear comfortable shoes. Since this is Korea, the mall does have a lot of skin care, make-up and beauty stores. Many of the shops in Myeongdong are also in Coex. There are who stores and fashion stores and a lot of restaurants. There are high end shops but also bargain places like Daiso. What I wish they had though was bookstores and shops for stationery, pens and art materials. For a tourist who has to attend a convention in the nearby Coex convention centre, this is a good place to shop. Also a good place to get gifts to bring home."
Probably the Largest Mall in Seoul,"The Mall has all Kinds of Brands that is usually found in the Market, the Mall is very Spacious and Probably the Biggest in the City, it has an Adjoining Art Center and Other Places for Shopping. it can be easily reached through Taxi, Trains and Buses."
So big mall that you may lost,I was attending a conference in COEX convention center. So this is the mall as well. So big that you may get lost. Little costly but there are lots of items. Many food outlets to choose from in case you are hungry. Food is not so costly.
huge,"This is a huge underground mall which has a stature of gangnam style hands outside which is a tourist op. Inside has a money change bank , lots of food places, subway access. and of course commercial shops. Good to spend half a day if the weather outside is too extreme. But it is very commercial. Doesn't represent the true culture or Korean style in my opinion. So a couple of hours is the most you should spend here. It is across the street from the temple so it's handy to cool off or refresh after the temple visit."
Awesome shopping centre ,"This mall is very much like every other mall. There is a very good variety of shops and it has all the major skincare brands and make up brands. The clothes shops are also very trendy and cool. The food malls have a large variety to choose from, the is halal food for Muslims, which is very convenient and new. Last time I visited almost 2 years ago, the wasn't any halal places to eat. Now there is, which I am very happy about! The staff are very helpful and friendly. The location is very easy to find, right next to Samseong station. The mall is located in a very nice area, very up and coming! "
Big and expensive,"This mall is nice if you're bored, have lots of money and if it's raining out. This mall used to be for the middle class but now it's just ridiculous. The majority of the new stores are so expensive, only rich people can afford to shop here."
"A Big Mall, nothing more","This is a big serpentine mall, lots of stores, nothing really special, bring crumbs to find your ay out!"
COEX,"Amazing shopping mall in Gangnam. Lot of restaurants, acuarium and stores. Ohh and the PSY hands statue!"
Great new mall,"The mall is large and quite new. Also includes a casino and Aquarium. When we were there, not all stores were complete yet as it was still fairly new. It also didn't seem too crowded."
Luxury mall ,"This is the luxury place ,Shopping department store,And also aquarium located there , you can also reach casino near by.Great to see , but closing soon at night !"
Shop shop shop!,"A great place for a rainy day!It's easy to get lost in here because it really is big!Loads of shops (particularly cosmetic shops), cafes and restaurants!In general the shops here are more expensive.I could spend several hours here browsing and shopping without getting bored as there's loads to see! "
No more kimchee museum,"We came here in hope to visit kimchee museum on a rainy day. Unlike Myeongdong, this mall is full of local people! It is pleasant and a lot less crowded. However, we were a little disappointed that kimchee museum is closed. "
One stop shop mall ,So close to aloft hotel easy to get there as most cab know it. Nice shopping place and lots of food there and everything in one stop 
Big mall,"This is a nice big Mall with lots of products and restaurants.Is nice especially on a hot day to cool down, If you love footwear i recommend you to visit ABC Markt is a great store with great selection and the price is really good."
Huge mall all in one,"Like other extra huge malls, COEX mall has everything you need under one roof. The unique point is, it's connected to city airport check-in mall, 5 star hotels, Hyundai Department Store, world trade centre and conveniently link to Samseong metro station. Local cafe and eating places at cheaper price mostly hidden at the corner; more premium cafe and restaurant is at easy to spot location."
SM Town fans,If you are a SM Town fans you will find this place so great you can find your bias merchandise and they have a coffee shop and theater. there are a mall next to it have some shops and its next to the metro station
"Clothes, shoes and accessoires","If you are looking for a mall where lots of things happen don't go to this place. They have every brand and every big shop which involves clothes, shoes and accessoires. Just 1 marvel shop and some minor kid stores. Other areas got way more variety in stores."
For SM Town Fans,"For the SM Town fans you can buy some of merchandise in this mall, there is also digital theater for watching. You can recording your sound and become like SM Town singer. "
COEX Underground center,"Underground shopping center with variety of choices when it comes to shopping for clothes and more, alot of restaurants and a cinema is available. Connected to 2 department stores (Hyundai & Parnas) 2 mins walk to the subway line 2."
Not too many shops for its size,"I arrived a little after 10 on Sunday and felt like it was a ghost town. The mall is enormous but there were just a few people about. The stores seemed to be closed or without any customers. When I came later, around noon, it was hard to get around as the mall got very crowded. And it was apparent why. Queues were forming in front of all restaurants which aren't in a dedicated food court but scattered all around. Apart from many restaurants and a few stores, the mall is home to several halls where 3 different conventions were being held on the day. In addition, on the second floor you can find hundreds of small businesses. "
It's a MALL,"Meh! If you are looking to shop, sure go shopping...but if you're looking for some uniqueness, then look elsewhere.Within 5 mins I was bored. However, there was a large bookstore with a English section, so nice to sit and have a read (until an obnoxious English man with his child decided to read really loud - (no consideration). Would be a great place to relax and read a book (com' on tourist, have some class :)#grumpy!Enjoy (if you want to go shopping and want to buy and read a book)! "
A Huge mall,A huge mall with most international brands available. Ideal for those looking to buy branded stuffs. There is a lotte duty free store in the mall.
Very Confused Layout....Maybe It Was Just Me,"When we visited this mall I kept wondering: maybe it's just because I am an American. We walked and walked and walked and we never found really much of anything. It was very strange. And then we would find ourselves in a giant, empty convention-hall lobby? All malls in Korea are not like this: we found several other malls to be sensibly laid-out and easy to navigate. Not so at the COEX Mall."
"Enormous, but could be anywhere on the planet","If I were organizing a world conference with 30,000 participants, this would be a very attractive venue. Sandwiched between 2 5 star hotels, the conference centre and mall are testimony to South Korea's economic success. The most fascinating part is the Hyundai Department store basement, where you can get an overview of a wide variety of Korean food."
Family-friendly,"We had a great day there and helped us get past the jet lag. Famished we went straight to get some mouthwatering neng myun or cold noodles and grabbed a bingsoo dessert. Lots of food options and was surprised to see even Indian and Turkish food.But what we liked were that there's a nice aquarium for the kids which we'll have to come back for since we spent most of the time at the kids lounge (Pororo). Traded off shopping while the kids played. Also visit the Kakao store for adorable character items.All in all, 4 stars and a high recommendation for families who want a central place to eat, have fun, and shop."
A paradise for tourists,"The largest shopping mall in Seoul.There are many stores, restaurants, cafes, cinemas, concerts,……as well as a Kimchi Museum and an Aquarium. The mall is connected to the Hyundai Department Store and at least two 5 star hotels. .You can spend half a day here, to buy, to play, to eat, to be entertained, and even to learn. A paradise for shopaholics and tourists."
Impressive and Texas size ,"It's a huge mall with lot of stuffs to explore, clothing, entertainment, souvenir, food, aquarium, etc. You could easily spend a day there. We have a great time there and think it's worth a visit. "
Excellent,"A very big mall. Need clearer map. Great variety of shops. Consider putting a supermarket in the mall, then will be perfect."
Big mall with all shopping and entertainment.,"The Coex is a big complex with shopping and entertainment in underground and hotels, city airport, bus terminal, hotels, casino etc on ground and other floors. The big conference complex is the main area where lot of foreigners come. It has some good restaurants. There is a bank near south gate and gives good exchange rate.Big aquarium is a good show. Some Shops allow a little bargain but most are branded."
YOU MUST SEE IT,We live in the home of Mall of America and were impressed by this place. I went alone the first time and then had to bring my husband back just so he could see the maze that exists below the COEX
HUGE!!,"It's a Huge underground mall with many facilities from shopping center, restaurants, post office, smtown until casino. It's an integrated and connected to many building in the complex which might make us frustrated and get lost to find the way. Eventhough there are signage and information center, you might still feel confuse. But overall, it's a great place to look around and travel when you are not rushing time. Lots of International Brand exist there."
Largest underground mall in Asia,"This mall is located one level down from ground level in the COEX complex. Lots of different shops, though most are for clothes. To me the biggest attraction is the wide variety of restaurants offering everything from Korean staples such as Bibimbap to European and American style food."
We went for the Gangnam Hands,"Not sure if there's a shorter way, but we had to walk quite a few blocks from the Gangnam Station exit to reach the front of this enormous mall.Unfortunately, we arrived around eleven at night, way past the closing hour of this mall. I would have liked to get inside. Even at the late hour, you could see the interior and how big the place is.We then went to the front after locating the new art installation for Gangnam Style, and danced like fools under the hands so we could cross off ""Dance to Gangnam Style in Gangnam"" off our bucket list. HAHAHA.Needless to say, we got weird looks from people who looked like they were on their way home, as well as from those who just got off at the bus stop behind the monument. We also probably gave a laugh to the people manning the CCTVs. =))))"
Worst shopping experience,"Very frustrating the way that it has been built it is quite a mess really. shops are everywhere you get lost and so spaced out , not much shops to buy from eventhough its huge took us so long from myeongdong to gangnam by taxi so much traffic and was a waste of time, not worth the visit "
Good to visit for shopping & dining.,Located in East of Kangnam area. There are many restaurants and pubs. Always crowded with young people and tourist. There cinema as well. 
Loved,"I was an easy access from our hotel ( Oakwood premier coex) where you can find delicious food (Halal), bakeries, sweets sand many shops to choose from. You can have your gifts from there like we did. Also it has an aquarium which we enjoyed so much."
Huge,The mall is huge and has a ton of stores and restaurants. It is a great indoor activity for a rainy day. There is also an aquarium that was awesome for my young child. 
Lots of shopping under one roof,"It's good because you can find whatever you need here, and grab a meal at one of the several restaurants they have."
A huge mall,"The mall is huge and I enjoyed walking in the mall. However, it was difficult for me to find directions. I felt that it was like a maze.There are a lot of restaurants in the mall and I particularly liked the donkatsu restaurant Saboten a lot. Because the mall is connected to Grand Intercontinental hotel and Hyundai department store, it was convenient to wonder around in all three places without having to go outside."
Average mall,No point of interest despite being the second largest mall in asia. Layout is so confusing and and got lost a few times trying to find the food court. Too many international brand that can be found anywhere. 
Asia'a largest underground Mall,"This is the claim it makes, and many agree! Rankings aside, this place is a great place to hang out for high end brands and cosmetics in the Gangnam district (Gangnam-Gu). Took us about 25 mins by cab from city centre (CBD) and about KRW 11,000 to get there. Restaurants are great too, and the metro network has a station in the basement. Great outlets include Butter & Zara Home."
Not particularly interesting,"This used to be one of my favourite areas to hang out in. There aren’t a large number of crowds, and the area is humongous anyway. However, I feel that the way the shops are laid out isn’t very well-planned. You’d find an area with food in one corner, walk for another 10 minutes and find another cluster of food stalls at another area. The signage/directions are rather confusing at times and the place is too big, it can be a pain if you are looking for a specific shop and realise you have to walk around 20 minutes just to get to it. The developers could have built more floors instead of having almost 95% of all the shops on the same level. There are a lot of international brands as well, so shopping isn’t particularly interesting for me. I feel that guidebooks tend to over-rate this place way too much."
Not enough signage,"This complex is quite large and you can reach there either from Sports Complex Station or Bongeunsa Station. With many local or international brands, restaurants, casino, duty free shop & hotel, there is not enough signages to ensure you are on the correct way to the destination, so I have to check the digital directories from time to time."
Lots of cafes & branded shops,"This mall is huge so u could focus on certains stalls that u are hunting for, or just shop wherever u walk to. Tried the drinks and cake at Sopresso Coffee, which were pretty good"
Gigantic Mall...,This mall was enormous! Full of expensive shops and a little less expensive shops that you see everywhere else in Seoul. The aquarium was a point of interest but we did not go because it's too much and if I wanted to see fish I'd go diving instead lol. There's a huge K-Pop shop/museum connected to it that was interesting. Our group wanted to see the Kimchi museum but it was no longer in the mall anymore.
Used to be better before the revamping,"A bunch of international brands and designers with just a few korean ones. Used to be a big mall with loads of korean shops and studio ghibli store. Now it's a big mall with mostly boring shops.. Used to be worth the visit, not anymore. Now it's a great place for locals.."
Huge mall ,Talk about shopping this complex is huge there are many shops and high-end trendy stores if you are on a tight budget I wouldn't come here because it's really high end restaurants and stores. It's also very large but it's also very confusing I found it very difficult to navigate so if you're willing to spend a lot of money and buy really nice high end clothing and purses and watches this is the place to be it's also very close to the subway station.... near 잠실 too!
Huge complex,"Shopping, aquarium, hotel, restaurants, mart all within one complex with connections to Hyundai department store, the CALT building and more, can get lost easily however there are directories everywhere, don't bother going to the customer desk, they can't really speak English. "
"New, scattershot layout frustrates beyond belief","It's hell to find anything with no rhyme or reason why it's laid out the way it is. I thought it was confusing before the 2 year renovation but I was soooo wrong. They label shops by letters and numbers but it makes no sense when they intersect with each other and the arrows/signs are just wrong most of the time. Spent 20 mins looking for a restaurant in the food court but it's not a traditional courtyard style food court. It's just restaurants almost along the same row. It gets even more confusing when you add the Oakwood arcade foodcourt into the mix.The shops aren't really anything special either. They claim no exclusives in Seoul and everything can be found in Myeongdong, Gangnam or Garosugil. The only benefit might be when it's poor weather outside since COEX is underground."
"Massive mall, but can be passed on","I read that this was one of the largest underground malls in the world and the largest one in Asia I believe, so I had to come here. This place indeed is very big with an assortment of shops (and a random small aquarium as well!), but it's easily passable if you're tourist as there isn't anything really remarkable/memorable about it. They have an alright food court though."
a very big mall!!!,"A very big mall, have lots and lots of shops, a very accessible to subway. There are restaurants too, anything you want under a roof."
Huge!,This is the largest conference venue I've ever attended. You need flat shoes and be prepared for miles of walking inside!
Huge mall,"This mall is huge and mostly under ground, but it's basically just a regular shopping mall, only easier to get lost in. Worth visiting if it's raining outside or if you're looking for something specific. Not really an attraction in itself, though. "
Get lost in Coex Mall,"I'm not usually one for crazy shopping trips while travelling, but we made Coex Mall a destination when we found out about the Gundam Base retail store cuz we're nerdy like that.So big that it has two different KTX stops that bring you to its front doors.It's more of an upscale mall with a great variety of popular Korean and foreign brands (Uniqlo, Roots, and some European designers are all I remember off the top of my head) as well as smaller boutique stores. Also being in a very developed area of Gangnam as well as being a destination in its own right, everything is a little bit more expensive here, especially compared to many of the other underground malls that have more stalls than built-out stores.The food selection has a wide variety of prices and offerings so you'll find something you like for sure. The Seoul Aquarium and a movie theater are also in the mall if you're not much of the shopping type.All in all, covering the whole mall would take about an hour of non-stop walking. While stopping in a few shops here and there, you can get through it in 2-3 hours. If you're like my girlfriend, well, you can spend the whole day here pretty easily. We did this early on in our trip to Korea so it was a nice introduction to Korean mall culture and the local style, I guess."
Decent shopping mall,"This mall has many shops out of the ordinary, and is therefore worth a visit. Many wacky stores makes this perhaps the best place to go if you only have one day shopping in Seoul. There is a large selection of restaurants as well with a variety of foods."
Biggest underground mall in the world!,"I'm here several time during my visit in Seoul, 2 times for SBS award shows Red Carpet and once for visiting SMtown artrium. There are few Halal restaurants here, but mostly quite pricey, so I decided to eat at Lotteria, lol. Many cool cafes and boutiques and you can check out too. Oh and every end of the year, there is an award show held in COEX convention hall, if u're lucky u can catch a glimpse of their artists walking down the red carpet. Well, I'm lucky enough to see Runningman casts and several Korean actors/actress this year :)"
HUGE,"It's a one-stop-shop-kind-of-mall, it has everything for everyone. It has hotels connected to it, the MRT station, an aquarium for the kids, grocery, convenience store, international and local brands as well. "
this is mall a very huge mall,It is not usual to see people carrying maps when walking in malls. But the sheer size of this mall and you will understand why.The walk spaces are wide but the stores themselves are pretty moderate in size.Both the Grand Continental and Continental Coex are found at both opposites of the mall. There is a casino and Lotte Duty free. Check out the Megabox Cinema. Extremely classy.
huge underground mall,"since we were staying at insadong, it took us a while to travel down to coex mall. get off at samseong station. this part of seoul is more modern since it is located south of the han river. part of gangnam gu. we decided to visit this mall as it raining and wanted to stay indoors. this mall was touted to be the biggest underground mall in seoul. so we had to check it out ourselves. indeed it was huge with name brand outlets that we are familiar with if visiting the united states of america. i now understand why koreans shop a lot in america. branded names are quite expensive in seoul. "
"Huge, very classy mall","Get off at the Samseong Station and COEX is right there. We stayed here all day walking around as it is connected to the Intercon, Oakwood Hotels, as well as the Hyundai Department Store. Lots of pricey brands and outlets, and a selection of fast food options. There is also an aquarium although we did not bother to go inside. Perfect for a rainy day or blistery weather outside."
Come for the food and movies; leave for the real shopping,"Pretty modern indoor mall (connected underground by subway). Lots of a great eats and there's a movie inside that plays the hits of the day. My goal was never to actually shop here but from the looks of it, I'd go elsewhere. Seems overpriced and in certain places, too specialized - or is that the point? There's an aquarium inside too which I was really tempted to go but I'd just eaten a bunch of sushi and didn't need a reminder that I had probably eaten Nemo."
Very huge mall,"It was a huge mall with luxury boutiques. Many food outlets to choose. If you are thinking to buy something economical, you can forget about going there....I would suggest going to Myeongdong and Dongdaemun area better."
Good prime location,Nice mall with many dining options. It's in upscale business area near Intercontinental Hotel with easy access. 
Lots of nice food and shopping!,We loved this place! All restaurants and coffees were very good. And it was connected to a department store too. Especially coffees at Kona Queens - not sure the name were very lovely. We will visit again sometime soon. 
Great,"Had up market mall. The Best part is the Aquarium. Its approachable by two lines, green and brown. The Aquarium is must see. The shops are a bit costly but you could find some often most fashionable stuff here"
Spend the day at COEX before leaving Seoul!,"We took a $12 US cab ride from Insadong to COEX Mall. We walked in and followed the signage to the City Airport Transit. Only travelers on certain airlines may use this service. We were traveling on Korean Airlines, which was one of the associated airlines. We checked in our luggage, got our seating assignment and boarding passes, then, went upstairs next to the Airport Limo Bus waiting area in a section called ""Arrivals"". There were lockers to rent for about $3 -$4 US for 6 hours. We stored our hand carry luggage there. My husband is interested in tea, and lucky for him, there was a huge Tea Exhibit in one of the conference halls. We spent several hours there admiring exquisite displays of tea cups, ceramics and tea pots that were impressive! Some of the artists were there serving tea in their bowls. There was a plethora of teas and everything related to tea. We saw a tea ceremony performance and talked to so many people. When you're there, check out what conferences and exhibits are held--you may be lucky like us! We left because I was starving! There were so many restaurants to choose from in the mall. We saw an eyeglass shop and had heard that eyeglasses were reasonable in Korea, so, we checked it out and got some spiffy glasses as our souvenir! They were professional there, checking our eyes against our prescriptions and I was glad that we went there rather than a shop on the streets. The mall kept going on and on with an Aquarium, movie theatres, shopping, shopping and more shopping. We had planned to walk across the street to Bongeusa Temple for tea, but, we were tea'd out after that fabulous Tea Exhibit. We found our way back to our lockers using the well-marked signage, then, bought the Airport Limo Bus ticket (about $17 US each). The ride took a little over an hour and dropped us off on the 3rd floor at the airport where we could skip the long lines and go through the City Airport Transit line. Wonderful experience!"
Huge Mall,Huge mall! It's very easy to get lost so definitely grab a map. It's a pretty standard mall with some fun stores. Check out Butter for kitschy household items and souvenirs. The Hyundai department store is a must see. It's 11 stories and filled with high priced boutique stores. It's fun just for the experience. The mall has a ton of restaurants in and around the food court. They are all fairly quick so you could easily eat here on break from a conference. 
Biggest underground mall in Asia,"I've been here twice and I have to say the first time was better. While it was under construction it seemed like it had SO much potential to be bigger and greater. The second time I visited, after the renovations, it was just a giant regular mall with regular stores. Or maybe I was just tired of Korea by then."
Nice shopping xenter,"Coex Mall houses quite a lot of shops. It is connected to the Hyundai Department Store. In the mall is also a casino. Did not check it out so won't be able to comment. More importantly, it is connected to the City Airport where you can check in your flights and baggages in advance. To get there, take the metro to Samseong Station and exit at exit 5 or 6. "
Average for Shopping except.............,"The mall itself seemed very average to me. Yes, there are a lot of stores, most aren't high end, and most aren't low end, just somewhere in between. The lay out of the mall is very maze like. At times I wasn't sure where I was going. But, somehow the mall connected into the Hyundai Department Store. Since this is located in Gangnam, the first two floors are dedicated to luxury shopping. And I do mean ""high end"". This Hyundai Department Store is the best in Seoul! And they have a food court on the lower level. Is the mall still worth going to..........it sure is. There are lots of other things to do there. Shopping, Casino, Aquarium, lots of restaurants, and a Cinema. You could spend the whole day here. Strictly Shopping - 2 StarsBesides Shopping - 4 StarsHyundai Department Store - 5 Stars"
Huge place with good shopping and a tiny casino,"Decided to see their casino and play some slots...sorts fun, but do NOT expect anything resembling Vegas.The mall has tons of shops. Stopped for lunch at Bulgogi Brothers, a chain restaurant. Bibimbap was 8/10."
Lots to see and do - and mostly underground!,"COEX Mall looks very futuristic from the inside, a maze of ways to go with a huge Cinema, Aquarium, food court and dozens od stores to shop in. Easy access to Hyundai Department store as well."
Shops and more ,It's a big mall with an attached convention center and aquarium. It has got all the international brands and has great ambiance. It is also attached to a metro station making it very easy to access. Great place to shop and spend a few hours. 
You need all day,Wow biggest mall I have been in . There is a aquarium inside a cinema and heaps of shops . You can get lost but there is everything and every brand you can think of .
literally_a_maze_mall..,"COEX mall is so huge that it is divided into different sections.. i'm quite a map nerd.. so during my trip with my sister.. we literally got lost.. hahahaha.. we are unable to comb the entire area because we have no idea which part have we went and which part we didn't.. because it's just too huge.. just like any other shopping malls.. a lot of shops to shop around.. a lot of makan place to eat in.. not sure about cafes but we do find one to chit chat and enjoy the cakes while taking time to rest from the long hours of walking.. will revisit it again when we're back to Korea and hopefully this time round we can comb every single section and every area of the shopping mall.. c"",)"
Maze like mall that never ends,"It is large and maze-like enough to get lost in. There are nice stores and lots of cafes and good restaurants. And then there is a huge Hyundai department store. The first level of Hyndai mall is like a big kitchen with treats from all over the world. It has lots of bakeries selling awesome treats like cheese cakes and other desserts and fruits.,And you can find every luxurious brand under the Sun in on other levels this mall.The maze and the vastness of the mall allows you to wander around aimlessly!!The mall is connected to three five star hotels Oakwood, Intercontinental and Gran Intercontinental. It seems there is also an aquarium closeby. I cudnt visit that.So walk around, shop, eat and tire urself!!"
Cool Mall,"If you're in the market for a ""cool"" ""mall"" – and assuming there is such a thing – in Seoul, then Coex should make you happy. It is large and maze-like enough to get lost in. There are nice stores you don't often find in Seoul – Brooks Brothers Black Label, Molton Brown, GAP + GAP Kids, Nike, Addidas, Kiels, Marimekko, a bunch of other cool clothing shops, cool home decor shops, a Gundam Robot shop and TONS of cafes and good restaurants. And that's not even including the Hyundai department store. If you venture around to the bottom of the Hyundai department store, there are lots of bakeries selling awesome treats, a shop selling the best Korean mochi treats (dduk) that I have found in Seoul – including one with white cake crumbs which tastes like birthday cake that my whole family absolutely loves, a good wine shop and a cool place to find interesting kitchen items from around the world.… so… if you're looking for a day to wander around aimlessly indoors… a place that will keep everyone in the whole family happy… yeah… give Coex a wander.Also there usually seems to be some sort of a special event or pop up store event happening here, so you never know what you'll bump into."
Coex Mall the best place to shop in Seoul,"Coex Mall has so many shops one needs an entire day to cover the entire shopping place still i would say you bet you'll come here to shop. All air-conditioned the shops range from Clothing, Souvenirs, toys, artificial flowers, jewelry, toys and eateries. "
Extremely Large mall with Aquarium,"Huge mall in Korea. Good for mall goers & those who come to Korea mostly for shopping. When I say huge I'm not kidding, means a lot of walking. Decided to take a stop here after a day of exploring, was curious about the Aquarium since I had time to spare. Looked down the long hallway & was just ""Nope, my feet hurt I've been walking all day. I'm done"" LoL other than that the parts of the mall I did see were good. "
The only mall I went to in Korea.,It's a big mall. It's very modern. You can find everything and nothing at the same time. It's way too big. As a tourist this was not for me. I think it doesn't showcase the Korean culture. I don't know. I'm not a mall person I just came here because I had to see it for myself since it was my first time in Korea and it was on my way back from gangnam. Skip this place if you don't have much time in Seoul. Come here if you have plenty of time.
Just the real feast for the eyes in such city as Seoul !,"So while the others in our group rather circled in the part of the city on the left coast of river Han, we ( my wife and I ) decided to go across the river and visit some interesting sites in, I may say, more modern region of so dense populated metropole, as it is Seoul. To get on the right coast of the river Han, we had taken a subway tram, whose line is not put deep beneath the ground level, that is, we had a ride with so called ""light metro"".We crossed the Dongbu Bridge and in Gangnam-gu region got to the very exciting place, called Coex Mall.That is an underground big shopping mall. There are here many conventions centers, exhibitions halls, many malls with plenty of shops.Then, passing by these attractive shops, we got to the food courts with traditional korean food. Along with such pleasant stores, we found also the couple of movie theatres, COEX Aquarium, a large book store and even one Museum.You can use the Seoul Metro Line 2, to arrive there. Not so far from the Coex Mall is located Samsoeng Complex, that is very worth to be seen."
Seoul shopping experience,Complicated layout but in case I really have enough time for shopping while drifting from one shop to another you will find anything you want :)
Plenty of stores but not much to see,"I liked COEX Mall before the renovation. It was smaller and had more of a vibe. Now it's huge but lacks any imagination. On a weekday it feels empty due to its expansiveness. On weekends, it's better. Unless you're there to watch a movie or visit the aquarium, there isn't much to do but shop and eat. I guess that's fine for most but I for kids, it can be a bit boring."
Massive mall but expensive,"The mall is massive. Very close to park hyatt hotel and attached to the station. It has an aquarium, movie theater and a food court. Many brand shops but very expensive in-comparison to other places. Good place to enjoy and rest after a long business meeting."
