An Active Temple,The temple isn’t just a tourist attraction but an actual active one. There are monks and worshippers at the temple so it is a real authentic Korean experience and worth a visit. Though the temple is located right within the business area on Gangnam-gu it is nice and quiet and an opportunity to relax and wind down. 
Nice quiet temple,This is an active temple with worshipers. The architecture is interesting and worth a visit. It will not take very long to visit the property. 
Moving...,"this temple in the middle of the city across the Intercontinental COEX hotel, is amazing; you will be surprised by the calm and serenity of this place; take a walk around and feel the power of this place; "
Nice temple opposite COEX,"The temple is easily accessible by subway. It is located just across the road from COEX (where the aquarium is). Lovely temple with big Buddha statue. Just as I entered the temple, a magpie stopped in front of me. Did not miss the chance to take its photo. There is a small tea-shop for the visitors; from there one could just relax and view the city from its balcony."
A quiet space across the street from the COEX,"Literally across the street from the massive convention centre is this place of peace and quiet surrounded by the city. Great history and architecture,nice walks in the woods. Current construction on the site distracts a little but it's still easy to find a quiet place to pray (for Buddhists) and a peaceful escape for everyone else."
Quiet place next to Coex center,"This temple is just next to Coex center. It is at a hill side. Though next to busy business buildings, this place is surprisingly quiet. Few people came during the noon when I visited. There are a few buildings there and takes some climbing to see them. It is a good place if you want to escape from busy life around it for a while."
Very nice,Beautiful temple that has a lot to explore. Little bit of uphill walking involved but it was great to see. 
Clean and Respect,Its just opposite the Coex Mall by walking distance and no entrance ticket needed.There is alot of people praying here as well.
Temple in the Heart of Gangnam,"A great place to visit during your stay in Seoul. There are very old pictures that are Naitonal treasures, and other monuments to see.A must to see."
Neat temple,"Stumbled on this the last day I was in Seoul. Right near the hotel, didn't even know it was here. You can walk around the temple and even stay at night if you'd like. It feels very calm and relaxing even though it is surrounded by city. Love the old and refurbished architecture. "
"Don't be annoying, watch out for construction","We stopped to take in some living culture - be aware, this is a practicing temple, people go there to pray and reflect, so bring your best behavior! I can't tell you how many noisy, annoying tourists we saw! For us, we simply walked the grounds, sat in the shade, and spoke quietly in whispers about the rituals and what we were experiencing. It seems as though the temple is undergoing a massive overhaul of their buildings and reorganization of the entry/grounds. Lots of orange cones, construction equipment, and scaffolding everywhere, but we'll probably go back on our next journey to see the completion."
"If you're visiting just one temple in Seoul, make this the one","The statue, while not the largest that I've seen, is definitely quite inspiring to stand in front of and behold. And then you notice all the other ones surrounding it.This temple and complex might not seem like much from the start (construction in the front, by a major roadway and across from a convention center), but it's definitely worth a visit. Don't let the exterior fool you - it's a completely different experience once you start wandering within.Note that the exterior and parts of the complex are currently under construction. While the construction noise does detract a bit from the experience, honestly once you start walking through the complex you notice it less, largely because of the chanting that gets aired through the grounds."
Temple in Middle of Crowded City,This is a temple complex in the middle of bustling Seoul. It is very beautiful and interesting to see and well worth a visit while near COEX. 
Buddist temple in the heart of Gangnam,"I have been visited this temple because of a suggestion of a friend of mine. I have to say that you cannot be disappointed,there is a great integration into the skyline between heritage and new building, which is facinating. you can walk around the park for free and enjoy the beutiness of it. Be respectful with other people that are there to pray."
Impressive place,Subway Line #9 stops nearby making it convenient to visit. The place is impressive with the 23 meter tall statue.
Unique experience on temple stay ,"A random decision to book 2D1N temple stay in Seoul. It's a journey of learning & experience Korean Buddhist culture w open mind regardless of religion , background. Friendly & humble coach , Sunims , yoga teacher sharing their experiences n stories. Will definitely make this as part of future trip to Korea "
"Wonderful temple, Perfect to combine with COEX center",Greets place to combine with a tour of COEX convention center and mall and see the famous Gangnam style sculpture right next to both. Better in the fall season but worth a visit yea round. 
History and modernity.,"Incredible grandeur, peace and tranquility - a fantastic combination of the Shrine and the modern industrial city."
An incredible site,"A beautiful sprawling campus of temples (1 big + smaller ones), beautiful garden and woods, etc. My wife and I had a ceremonial tea here as well. Peaceful, spiritual, beautiful."
A Peaceful Oasi in Gangnam..,"Exactly at the exit of the Bongeunsa Temple Station (line 9).It's really a little piece of a peaceful oasi in the middle of Gangnam District.The entrance is beautiful: there are many lanterns, lotus flowers, and sculptures.It's a complex of temples with free admission, close to the COEX Mall.One of the most beautiful temples of Seoul!"
Old and New Juxtaposed ,"From Seoul Station, I took the subway and made a transfer to line 9, which has an exit right by the temple. It was very easy to find. The entry is beautiful with many white lanterns, flowers, and sculpture. Once inside the grounds, I enjoyed taking photos of the temple buildings with the modern skyscrapers in the background. It is such a stark contrast. It is very peaceful and I highly recommend this peaceful respite."
Beautiful temple with great temple food,"To get to the temple from COEX, go to the end of the mall with PF Changs and other restaurants outside. Go up the stairs to street level and cross the road, then the temple complex is on your left a bit further along the road.If you want to eat at the temple, follow the walkway with decorations overhead up to the building and go into the office on the right where you can buy a ticket (which is only a few thousand won). If you then come back out the way you came and turn right, walk past the shop at the back of the car park to the other temple large building and enter through the front entrance. There is a box to put your ticket in and then follow the queue and you will be served the set meal which is vegan. The staff were very friendly, helpful and welcoming, as were the other diners. Food is only served between 11:30-12:30 so make sure you time your visit well. The wider temple and grounds are very picturesque and are well worth some additional time before or afterwards to look around."
Serene,A very calming and serene temple to visit. The temple was lit up with hundreds of white lantern that made it even more calming. The lotus flowers added to the aesthetic. We went a little late in the day but it looked like they had a nice hiking area which I am sure would be great to check out. I recommend going in the afternoon.
A peaceful respite in a commercial district,This temple is simply beautiful and peaceful. It is across the street from the huge coex shopping complex but within minutes you feel like you are in an isolated mountain temple. You are free to walk throughout the sprawling complex up to hillside hiking trails. Well worth spending a couple of hours there. 
Two types of event for English speakers ,I walked by at the end of my vacation in korea. The temple was very beautiful and they offers classes(?) to experience Buddhism. I wish I knew about this earlier. 
mesmerising,"since i'm a buddhist, i figured i should come down and take a look, even if you're not, the place is right opposite coex starfield mall - so might as well drop by here. it is situated on a mound, so expect to climb a bit of stairs or walk up the slopes. the buildings and decorations are beautiful, especially the lanterns. just walk around, breathing in the calm scenery around"
Nice Peaceful Place,"Although hardly a must see, this temple is a true oasis of tranquility and peace amidst busy streets of Gangnam. If you happen to be nearby don’t miss your chance to spend some time here."
Peaceful and harmonious complex of Temples,Complex of small temples on a hillside opposite side of road to Coex conference centre and Coex Intercontinental Hotel. Beautiful displays of paper lanterns sponsored by worshippers. This is a large restoration site but done very sensitively to create a restful location in a busy city. Worth a visit as part of a Seoul trip. 
A wonderful experience!,"We visited one afternoon in June 2019 by chance. We were mesmerised by the thousands of coloured lanterns, the intricate and beautiful painting of buildings and the amazing plaza with hundreds of statues around a massive Buddha. Despite being in the centre of town it was very peaceful and spiritual. And amazingly it was free. Highly recommended."
Sprawling Temple Complex,"We were only able to see a small portion of the temple grounds as it was spread out over a good sized forested area. This was an unusual location as modern civilization has grown up around it. It was unfortunate that most of the original temple buildings were destroyed over the years and had to be rebuilt.There was lots of parking available here should you happen to drive. However public transport was still the best way to visit for us as it was close to many major sites such as the COEX Mall.The pathway leading to the temple was covered with colorful paper lanterns which seemed to be quite common. The same paper lantern ""roof"" continued through the first gate until we arrived at the main temple building. The main temple was large and intricately painted especially inside with the artwork surrounding the seated golden buddha statue. A short walk away from the temple led us to the Maitreya statue, which was a very tall representation of the future Buddha. I believe it was considered one of the tallest in Korea. It was located at the end of a wide plaza framed by a wall containing many miniature statues. It was beautiful setting.There were various pathways and stairs that led further into the temple compound but due to time constraints and aching feet we did not get the chance to explore them."
Buddhist Temple,"Worth the visit, the temple in the middle of city centre and just across the road to Coex Mall.Very big temple and also provide templestay for practicing meditation too."
Very nice temple,"I was here around sunset and really enjoyed it. The temple looked great, as it was still decorated for Buddha's birthday. It was very quiet too, almost no one there."
Thankful to be back!,Glad to have a chance to revisit this place and looking at those colourful lanterns with wishes hanging onto it. The chance to bath the buddha was also great!The temple seems to be undergoing renovation.A real short walking distance from the subway station which is good choice for the elderly.
A quick oasis in a bustling city,"The grounds were peaceful and beautiful. There was monks chanting during our exploring. There was also some construction going on. The tea was delicious. There are a few templestay programs that are offered. You can visit most areas as long as you are quiet and respectful. It was well worth the visit. Even though many of it was newer and lots of concrete I find it didnt distract from the overall beauty. It was in the heart of a,war 60 years ago. Not being completely origonal is accetable to me. Since for many it is still a place of worship new construction also makes sense. "
"A nice tample, but not THAT nice.","Maybe I'm a bit spoiled by seeing so many of these, but I just wasn't impressed. The architecture is beautiful, yet forgettable. Nothing exceptionally unique here either. Also not impressed with how they fit it all together - that is, with the lack of any general plan, when you feel like it's one complex, and not just a set of separate buildings. Dusty footpaths everywhere instead of filling space with a garden is another problem, which seem to separate Korean temples from what I've seen in Japan. Overall, if you haven't been to a Buddhist temple before or only seen one or two, you may find it worth a visit. Otherwise, it's rather standard, even though still quite beautiful temple, with a moderately large territory to explore."
Magical at night,"The place was illuminated, not least by the profusion of artistically painted (probably) paper models. And then we saw the beautiful circular arena at the top with the very large statue of Buddha surrounded by numerous statues and a much larger number of statuettes - a wow moment"
Serene and Peaceful,"Bongeunsa Temple offers a reprieve in the midst of the bustling metro. We planned to only for a few minutes but we ended up staying more than half an hour. Its grounds were well-maintained and it was very peaceful. It sort of reminds me of Nara, Japan. It has several temples and a big Buddha statue. A lantern festival was being held when we went there which made the place extra interesting. A must-visit if you’re in the area! "
Could be better,"If the place was better installed with no parking lot and respectful of this religious space, it could be better because the hill and the little forest are very nice in the centrum of Gangnam Gu"
Nice quick visit,"I had a nice, quick, visit to this temple. I happened to be there when there was a lantern festival happening, so it was extra beautiful. All I did was wonder around since there isn’t any real directions or guides (at least that I saw), but that was enough to see the beautiful grounds and temple. Close to subway and other attractions. Would recommend stopping by if you are nearby. "
Beautiful,Very quiet and peaceful place. The painting on these building is amazing. Within walking distance of several hotels. 
wonderful main prayer hall,"temple with charming atmosphere, good retreat from the city full of energy. Three wooden statues of Budda in the main prayer hall and an old bronze bell."
Nice temple with a huge Buddha statue on the foot of the hill,"This temple is located not far from the metro. The temple is nice, calm and peaceful. There is a big Buddha in the temple. During spring, the cherry blossom and magnolia is blooming in the temple. "
Beautiful temple,The cherry blossoms were in full bloom when we went so it was picturesque. The colorful lanterns were both beautiful and touching because they all signified heartfelt prayers. It's right across Starfield Coex Mall. 
Peaceful and happy,"I always visit Bongeunsa as it is near my house, and I like the peaceful vibe I get when visiting. Even though it is in the middle of the city, I feel like you can get away from the city just going to Bongeunsa. It looks pretty these days with the blossoms too. But go quick, before it’s too late. I went two weeks ago, and though there were not too many blossoms yet, it was beautiful. They have also opened up a cafe, which I enjoyed having traditional omija tea (my favorite) and a Korean cookie."
free entrance to this temple with a giant statue,can accept temple stay in this templeno entrance feehas monks insidethey also have huge parking spaces
Korean tea is a wonderful experience,Not a huge temple but a gorgeous one in the middle of city life! Wonderful old sculptures- my favorite Buddha loves here!
Korean Temple,"Very easy access to the temple! The biggest plus of places outside of the city is that there are not so many visitors that makes these places gain a lot on the climate! One of the many temples so popular in Korea, with the here that we have preserved the atmosphere of this place"
Nice Buddhist temple,We visited this Buddhist temple while in Seoul. It took us about one hour to stroll through the various pavilions of the temple and to see the majestic Buddha statue. Interesting for those interesting in getting a glimpse of Korean Buddhism and those wishing to meditate. 
Better than the palaces,"This temple has so much more to offer than the more popular spots in Seoul.Gyeongbokgung Palace was just... big, while the Temple was wonderfully ornate and less crowded. I am so glad I went there."
Beautiful ,A very nice and old temple in the heart of Seoul. The entrance is free but you will be charged if you park there. The contrast between these very old temples and the new city is impressive.You will need about 30m to 1h to visit the place
A little outside of town but a worthwhile visit,"Seoul is such a large city - you don't realise the scale of it until you get there and it is clear the maps don't really do it justice. We came here because we saw some awesome pictures online of the buddha with the backdrop of the skyscrapers of Gangnam. To get that shot there is a path up behind the Buddha - but you might have to rustle some bushes to get behind and take that shot. Apart from the Buddha, there isn't too much to see or read about. This is a real place of worship and is not really built to be a tourist destination!"
a genuine temple,It is quite spacious with a lot of worshippers. It is easily accessible in from of the COEX center and transportations stations.
Past meets Present,This Buddhist temple is located in Gangnam district just across CoEx. It's a good example of an old structure meets modern buildings. The temple offers temple stay wherein foreigners can understand and experience what monks do in their daily lives. Nice place to visit and appreciate the structures and surroundings because its not often you can see something like this.
Serene temple,A bit of peace and calm in a bustling city. Good to have a stroll through the temple and have some time to reflect. Our favourite temple that we visited in Seoul.
What a piece of history,I visited on a Saturday in January. No crowds and mass was in process which added to my experience! Check it out for a piece of history in Korea
Amazing place,"Bongeunsa is an amazing place: a large temple complex that sits across the street from a busy shopping mall-hotel complex, and which is surrounded by tall buildings of the new town. The grounds have several old, traditional temple buildings, as well as a semi-circular open-air plaza with a tall statue of Maitreya, that we could see from our hotel. The main temple hall is beautifully decorated with lotus shaped lanterns and wood paintings. The temple is in active use and one sees locals performing prayers - very serene and peaceful experience."
Quiet temple inside of a busy city,It’s hard to believe that there is a small quiet temple nestled between tall city buildings. Bongeunsa Temple offered a quiet place to visit. There are prayers held there daily so visitors should be mindful.
Recommended,"Just opposite COEX shopping mall, this temple is another attraction of it’s own. Take more time to visit all the temple halls and the main attraction is tall Buddha and a open air area surrounded in a forest where devotees meditate and pray."
Experience Peaceful and Reflective Moments in Bustling Seoul,"You are an early riser tourist and looking for something to do. I would recommend Bongeunsa Temple which is located next to COEX Mall. It is being described as a millennial Buddhist temple that commands a rich history of over 1,200 years. Understand that they are opened at 3am and closes around 1000pm. No entrance fee at all.Boungeunsa Temple is a peaceful retreat that is nestled in the heart of one of the busiest location in Seoul. When you set foot at the entrance, it transports you into a distinctively different world. As foreigner, you can participate in the “templestay program” in experiencing traditional Korean Buddhist culture and practices.The location is easily accessible by public transport. There is an exit directly outside the temple. Most of the halls are well layout on forested hillside. The library is the oldest remaining building in the compound. It contains Avatamsaka Sutra woodblock cravings and over 3000 Buddhist scriptures.The main highlight of this historic Buddhist Zen temple is the 28 metres tall stone statute of Maitreya whom is the “Future Buddha”."
Serene temple,I reckon it's worth a visit especially if you're around gangnam area. The temple is open for free to all...even to Non-Buddhist. The temple is easy to find and walking distance from Bongeunsa train station. It's known for the tall Buddha statue and nice well kept oldest wooden temple and it's garden. Place is immersed in tranquility...I just loved it.
Nice Budhist temple in town,"If you have plan to visit huge library in COEX Gangnam, please dont forget to visit Bongeunsa Temple in front of east gate COEX. Its nice budhist temple where you can learn about budha religion even you can stay here. There is one big statue knside the temple..."
Temple with Great History,"The temple is great, you need to spend some time there, the flower decoration is awesome. Buddhism in Seoul. "
Serene Corner right in the heart of the bustling metropolis," As you enter the gates , you are transported away from the hustle bustle of a busy Seoul street into an oasis of peace and serenity. Beautiful traditional Korean architecture and artefacts . A must visit place while in Seoul . "
Bongeunsa Temple,"Whether you are Buddist or not, this Temple complex was beautiful and is one of the oldest in Seoul- across the street from the Intercontinental Hotel COEX-Gangnum-gu. It is an easy walk, with beautiful wooden temples.Guests are welcome to participate if they are so inclined to do so."
Very spiritual,"There are several temples in Bongeunsa, and it is a reverential experience. The prayers, the big Buda statue, the gardens, all are marvelous. "
Tranquility ,Amongst the hustle and bustle of gangnam sits this little piece of tranquility with fruitful quince and persimmon trees. A worthwhile visit. They also opened a tea house with views of the main garden.
Tradition in the middle of the city,"Very interesting because this temple is situated in the middle of the city. A visit here gives the opportunity to escape the city life and breathe. We also took part in a calligraphy lession with a monk, which I highly recommend."
Well preserve temple,"We visit the temple on the last day since we have nothing much to do. Very well preserve. But, if you coming around SMTOWN area, then can have a short drop off this place for some nice photo."
Buddhism temple with big statute,"This temple is located right next to COEX, a mega shopping mall and convention center. Visit here if you want to add some tradition in your modern traveling day in Seoul. "
very interesting afternoon,"I shared with 6 people in the thursday afternoon tour and it was very interesting. Clear explanation during a tour. Attent a session in the temple during prayers (very respectfully) and attent a drawing a drawing sessions that learnt you to meditateby focusing on drawing korean writing and a tea ceremony wit the same goal. The conversation with one of the monks was relaxing in itself. I had expected a full meditation session under guidance, but this was well compensated. Surely recommend this experience on an quiet island in the heart of modern Gangnam. "
Beautiful,"This is the bigest temple of seoul but is wonderfull. i loved visit tempels, every temple is special in it's own way but this was my favorite in Seoul"
Right near Coex Mall!,I didn't expect this temple to be as beautiful as it was. It's not too large but there's quite a bit to see which different sections as well as a staircase at the back leading to another area. The entrance to the temple is lined with lanterns and plants which makes for a great photo opportunity but don't forget to be respectful.
Hidden place in Seoul,"Usually temples are located outside of the city because they should be moved from the capital a long time ago. However, this temple is in the middle of Gangnam. You can be reached by a subway! and you can go to Coex mall after a temple visit. "
A Temple in Seoul City,Easily accessible with Seoul Subway Line 2 - Bongeuna Stationor Samseong Station (COEX mall)I spent like 30 mins touring the area and praying respect
Temple visit,"To be honest reading all reviews I can’t fully agree. It is a nice place, but nothing exceptional.Quite fast visit, when I was there there were 2 funerals and that gave another aspect of the traditions, nice to visit, but not a real must (for me). "
A must,"I have visited menu temples and palaces, but this one is one of my favorites places. You don’t walk too much to appreciate all the site.If you want to do something else around, Coex has an aquarium and it is just crossing the stree"
"Expansive site. Historical, serene. Seems a little manufactured, though","It is a large complex, with a number of smaller shrines in the midst. The temple grounds are well maintained and do not seem to close, even late into the evening. It is just directly opposite the COEX exhibition centre so easy to get to."
a serenity place to find a little peace,"It is located nearby COEX Seoul. In this temple, you can see the tall statue of Buddha. They have a few traditional houses where we can pray and join the activities of reading the Sutra. If you are willing to, you may donate as well. "
Gangnam Gem,Stumbled across Bongeunsa when visiting Gangnam - absolutely recommend visiting - beautiful grounds filled with lotus flowers and laterns - and the Buddha statutue is very impressive
Incredible history,"Over a thousand years old, this temple oozes history and culture. It contains woodblock carvings which resonate with Buddhists. Definitely worth seeing."
Tranquility in a metropolis,"The temple is a nice getaway from the hustle and bustle of the Seoul metropolis although it’s situated just opposite the COEX mall. It is easily accessible via metro (Bongeunsa station on line 9), just a 3-minute walk from the station. The temple complex is beautiful and has a lot of history to it. The best views are at the top after all the stairs (be ready for some climbing!) Entrance is free so do check it out if you are in the region (Starfield Library in the COEX mall is worth a visit too after visiting the temple)."
Mindfulness Place,Here is the first time I come here. I cant imagine that there's a Buddha Temple in the middle of Seoul. The Temple is next to the Mall. The Temple is very quiet and the lanscape is tradional. I like many handle picture on the gates and walls. The Temple besides the moutain make me feel so small. I'll come back this Temple on the future.
Spiritual Waterhole.,"A very beautiful place to relax, meditate and/or contemplate. I was there during a ceremony, and lucky enough i got to hear the monks chant and recitation. A very beautiful moment. It´s a strange feeling watching the skyscrapers (and all commercialism) surrounding this peaceful temple yard. There´s also a small buddhist shop beside the entrance where you can buy malas and gifts. Don´t miss this spiritual waterhole."
A sea of tranquility in a busy city,"Lovely temple complex in the southern part of Seoul, very quiet and peaceful. Templestay options are available"
City Escape ,"We were lucky we got a local lady who offered to tell us the background and history of this place . The temples were magnificent in their construction and attention to detail, we were lucky to also here ceremonies being carried out. The restoration project is in the pipeline for this place and least to say it will be impressive. The greatest vista was high up but more so the contrast of the temple roof to the highest rise scrapers behind "
Korea is very nice country,"I before was only by transit. This visit is second visit by long time, 2 weeks. I was also second time visit the Bongeunsa temple. This time I excited very beautiful flower..unfortunately I am forget the name. "
Worth avisit,"This temple located not far from the COEX convention centre is worth a visit, if one happens to attend a conference at COEX. "
Stair are worth it.,There are lots of stairs but the end is worth the climb. The details just amaze me in the designs and the build. WOW.
Excellent get a way when attending a conference in COEX,"Just behind the COEX is this nice temple, which makes it the perfect place to escape from busy conference life for a few minutes."
Nice Temple,Nice temple with some pretty buildings. Easy to get to and walk around. Takes about 40 minutes to see everything. Worth a visit if you are in the area.
Great Place,A great place to visit. Amazing how such a quiet and peaceful place has remained in the middle of a busy city. Won’t take long to walk around but really worth a visit.
Don’t Forget The Teahouse,"There’s a nice teahouse on the grounds of the Temple. You can sit at conventional tables or at more traditional tables. The staff does not speak English, but were great with hand gestures, pointing and laughter. Lots of fun."
Peaceful Area ,Nice place for an evening stroll if you are staying in the area and looking for a change of scenery. 
Loved the lanterns,"Visited the temple as we were meeting a friend nearby at the COEX. It's quite amazing that a temple like this exists in the middle of a busy area in Seoul full of tall, modern buildings. It feels so secluded and tranquil you can be mistaken for a while that you are in the mountains somewhere. We were lucky to see a couple of monks drumming. One of them came towards us and gave my husband a rice ball which was sweet. My friend recommended we return at night and it was even more enchanting and mesmerising with the various lanterns lit up. A recommended visit when in Seoul!"
Great Day In Gangnum.,Great for photos of the Buddha and the view. Easy to get to from subway. Lots of stairs but worth it. It's FREE so i recommend going there during the week.
Minimalistic feel,This temple is just across our hotel by the Coex and it's almost a crime if you don't go visit it. I find it very minimalistic but with nice and serene feel. You can see people praying and meditating so that is very nice and real.
Very nice,"For business in Seoul, I had the opportunity to see the temple while a ceremony was on going. Very colorful, with a big statue in marble. Wonderful the small Buddhas present in the grass. Look for them while walking"
Peaceful and beautiful,"Comparing with Jogyesa temple, I prefer this one because it’s much bigger, more beautiful and has more to see. Unfortunately it is much harder to get to but we were lucky as we were with a tour guide. You can enter the halls and watch or listen to the locals pray but be respectful and be quiet and no taking photos inside. It was enjoyable listening to the monks chant, it was very calming and peaceful."
Lovely grounds to walk through,The temple was opposite our hotel and we had driven past it a few times. We decided to visit one evening just before sunset. The crowds were gone and the place was blissfully empty and relatively cool too. The displays of lanterns were delightful and the new building construction was interesting to see as well as some of the painting and decorations on the older structures. The whole site is free to enter and wander around. Being next to the Coex site there are plenty of bus and subway options to get here or car parking on site if required. As the evening progressed some of the statues and lanterns were illuminated which just added to the serenity of the place amongst the bustle of the city.
A quick visit,Fortunate that I stayed at the hotel across Bongeunsa Temple. It was a nice walk inside -- serene and you'll hear the prayers and see the practice. 30mins walk is enough.
Great location ,If you are at Gangnam and you are fed up with all the Condo and Tower go overthere it s just front of the CEOX north entranceTe garden is nice till the top of the hillAnd ambiance is so..specialArchitecture style is traditional with some touch of so colorful thing !
Nice place,"It’s a great place near the city, where you can almost see how temples and modern buildings interact each other in the cosmopolitam city os Seoul."
Unique Temple Experience,"Having explored many temples in South Korea, Bongeunsa Temple has its own unique glamour. I took a walk through in the late afternoon (4pm) once the temperature dropped and it was quite crowded. There was an unexpected traditional Korean drumming performance at 5:30pm. It was very loud and could be heard throughout the temple. I would definitely recommend wearing comfortable shoes because this temple is currently under construction and there is a lot of rubble and rocks on the roads. I loved the beauty of the forest hidden behind the temples. The trees were vivid green and the air was so fresh and crisp. It was certainly an amazing break from the hectic pace of life in the city of Gangnam. Due to the reconstruction, I don't believe there is a charge for admission to get into the temple which was great. 1-2 hours was certainly more than enough time to visit the temple. I would recommend anyone visiting Gangnam to visit this beautiful Buddhist monument, if time allows."
Lovely working temple!,"Bongeunsa is a lovely calming place to walk around, particularly if you go in May when it is decorated for Buddah's birthday. It is a working temple, so there are some areas you can only go if you are praying, and there is very little information about the buildings and statues. But still, well worth a little stop off to see the beautiful architecture. "
Peaceful Bongeunsa,On entering this temple we took the brochure from tourist centre. The first thing that caught my eye were the multitude of colourful paper lanterns and which were all lined on a string and dancing as the wind was blowing . It was a nice place to take photos. We went ahead and offered our candles and flowers The place had different halls on different elevations (recommend to wear shoes) where one could meditate and offer respect.The halls had big wooden doors which had lovely carving on them. The entrance to these halls were on the side and not in the front. There were monks chanting which made the atmosphere soothing and one felt calm with lovely vibrations. One can make previous bookings and choose to spend a day there. There is clean accommodation The Big Buddha statue was impressive In spite of constructions on the place was well maintained. There were lovely trees with yellow flowers and I saw my first glimpse of a cherry blossom tree . Some photographers wee enthusiastically taking photos of the much popular cherry blossom flowers. I would visit this again to see how much more beautiful it is after reconstruction ❤️
Really Mice Temple but needs more English,Was attending a trade show across the road so took some time to visit the temple. Really nice temple and good experience but they need more signs and information in English. Didn’t have time to sign up for a tour but when you walk through you are not sure if you are allowed to take photos when you go into the different temple rooms. Did spend some quiet time in front of one of the shrines and was very relaxing. Definitely worth a visit but if you have time get a guide to make the most of it. 
Calm and peaceful place in middle,Calm and peaceful place in middle of one of the busiest cities of the world. The temple is very well constructed with a huge Buddha statue in the premises. Definitely worth visiting. 
I learned a lot about Buddhism,"if you like relaxation, calmness and tranquility, sign up for their workshop (Thursday 2pm) it costs W20,000 per person, they explain you about the philosophy, you will observe a tea ceremony and you will practice patience when drawing some letters, good experience, really I recommend it"
Bongeunsa Temple,Love this place. Feel so relaxing just to look at all the beautiful flowers and colorful paper lanterns. 
Fabulous place to visit around Buddha's birthday,"You must visit this temple during the lotus lantern festival/Buddha's birthday in the spring! There are hundreds of colorful lanterns strung all around the temple complex and they are incredible! This is my 2nd favorite of the many gorgeous Buddhist temples in Seoul (1st being Jogyesa). It is very welcoming and peaceful. The grounds/buildings are beautifully maintained. It is a fabulous place to go for a stroll, pray or meditate, or take photos. There is also a very tall sculpture of the Buddha on site that is very striking. I highly recommend visiting Bongeunsa."
A beautiful temple - very peaceful,We were staying across the street at the Coex so it was very convenient to visit multiple times. Beautiful grounds and well maintained temple buildings. Worth a visit!
During a visit to the area,While looking round Seoul we happened upon the Temple which is near the Rodeo Drive of Seoul. It was very nice. Fun and scenic to walk around. It was cold because of winter but very worth the visit. There is a mall just across the street also.
Very peaceful place,"Despite ongoing construction and being in city centre, I really enjoyed time spent in the temple. It is really peaceful and special. Has several buildings, as well as big buddha outside. Highly recommend to visit"
The Representative Buddhist Temple in the center of newly organized downtown.,"The Representative Buddhist Temple in the center of newly organized downtown. Of course the Bongeunsah Temple has been already located here before the development of newly organized downtown. Because the surrounding environment became a building forest, the Bongeunsah Temple became a natural and cozy site."
A peaceful place,This Temple has a magnificently calm atmosphere even though it is located in the center of modern Samsung-Dong district. Nice traditional buildings and beautiful Buddhist sculptures. I was so relaxed here and got a charge of positive energy. Highly recommend it!
Interesting place,interesting monastery where monks live. Apparently you can arrange a stay and enjoy the monk lifestyle for a couple of days. 
Bongeusna temple. ,I am first time in this temple. First of all this temple is very clear and calm. Very wonderful. I am very happy. 
Peaceful and Traditional,Bongeunsa Temple is comprised of multiple buildings. There are multi-lingual posters explaining the historical significance of each of the distinct areas. It was very pretty and peaceful. The entrance was free. This Temple is located across from Coex Mall.
Big Budda ,"Wonderful Buddist temple they accept reservation for accommodation at the temple. Beautiful place and about a 15 minute walk from the Joseon Royal Tombs inscribed on the UNESCO world heritage list. Amazing art great for pictures took me about an hour to your the entire place, light walking great for meditating not very on Sunday there was light tourist and local public. "
Must see in Seoul on a tight schedule,In the middle of town the temples are a must see if going through Seoul and without time to get out. Entry is free and you can freely wonder around taking photos.
Historical and serene,"Famous temple and it's more than 1,200 years old. Though partly damaged in the past, restoration work has mostly repaired it, and still going on. As a tourist site, they don't have much info about the place . locals come here for their prayersIt's just across the intercontinental coex where i stayed so it was convenient to get to"
Recommend!,Out of the way from other temples but worth it. Great place to spend and hour or so looking around. Very beautiful in every season even in the rain.
Nice!,"Really nice, peaceful, no entry, quite far from central Seoul, but worth it. Close to the aquarium. Do it."
Chila temple style in Busan,the old Chila temple style in Busan. like a palace in Korea. there has alms canteen is a good vegan. 
Great place to escape,"I love this place and it holds many memories for me. When I was working in the Samsung area I would come here often to escape the crazy city. It is calm and clear when I'm there. The noises melt away a bit. My friend went here to eat vegetarian meals (which are hard to find in Korea), and I came here to mediate and walk around like an old man. I'd often sit BEHIND the statue and watch the people come and pray. It sounds weird but I loved making up stories for everyone as they passed haha. Now that I actually am an older man (before I was 22), I came back with a filming crew to show them this amazing spot and the crazy juxtaposition of the city and the temple. They loved it too. It's a great spot if you're in Seoul, especially if you don't have time to get out of the city and you want to see a temple. Easy access from the subway line 2, or line 9."
Beautiful temple,"This Buddhist temple is amazing! There are locals that go for prayers, so remember to be quiet and respectful to them. The architecture is beautiful and the goddess statue is magnificent! Definitely a place to stop by for a quiet and peaceful time."
Magnicent Place to Relax,"Bongeunsa is a Buddhist temple founded in 794 during the Silla (one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea) period. The temple has more than 1,000 years of history and has many interesting historic and cultural features, including woodblock carvings of the Avatamsaka Sutra (Flower Garland Sutra). The temple is also a very popular tourist destination, offering various programs relating to traditional Korean Buddhist culture, in a variety of languages.Bongeunsa is more than a just temple. It provides a place to relax for busy city people and also gives people a chance to reflect upon themselves. The templestay program gives an opportunity to experience everyday life in the temple, which includes traditional Korean Buddhist culture and practices. Visitors can experience some simple Buddhist practices such as the daily dawn service, Korean Zen meditation, Dado (a tea drinking ceremony), and Balwoogongyang (a Buddhist meal with traditional bowls). Every May on Buddha's birthday, Bongeunsa holds the Lotus Lantern Festival on nearby Samseong-dong."
Large temple in Seoul,"It's a large temple next to the coex mall. Lots of locals were visiting to offer prayers in the evening, the time we visited. Please do respect them. There is a small souvenir shop at the premises with a decent collecting. The shop staff told it's open 365 days. "
Bongeunsa Temple Tour ,I toured the Bongeunsa Temple on a guided tour on 10th October 2017. The Goddess of Mercy is a very pretty statue. There are also various buildings in this temple premises. I’m downloading photos to display Bongeunsa Temple. 
Peaceful respite in downtown location,"The gongs sounds twice a day - 4:20 am and 6:20 pm - which you can hear if you stay at a hotel nearby. The grounds are free to wander, and it's a peaceful place to walk after a busy day around the city. Small gift shop with buddhist souvenirs."
Very pretty,"Very nice temple. We just took a taxi from the hotel and visited it during the evening. By the way, all temples are open 24 hrs."
Peaceful sanctuary in the midst of urban jungle,"The temple complex is a peaceful sanctuary in the middle of an urban jungle in Gangnam, Seoul. A serene place where people can go escaping the hustle and bustle of city life. The artifacts found in this temple in my opinion is a lot better than those inside the Gyeongbokgung Palace. We arrived here in the evening and the monks are doing their evening prayers. It added to the peaceful atmosphere that the place emitted. Definitely a must-see."
Nice and calm temple,Visited this place while they’ve praying session. Its a great experience for us to see and learn how the culture here. The temple also have a nice and calm garden theme compound. A lot of bonsai and pear trees around. How i wish i can pick a pear and eat it there. Haha
Lovely Temple in Gangnam,"This was one of the places I always wanted to visit after seeing a photo of the temple with the sky line of Gangnam in the background. The temple is very easy to find and is located just across the road from COEX mall. I spent a good couple of hours here just exploring and admiring the stunning traditional architecture, hearing the chants coming from the main hall whilst sitting on the steps was very relaxing. I am not religious in anyway but I felt comforted here a thousands of miles away from home. "
Beautiful peaceful temple,"Look out for the hazelnut tree at the entrance of the temple. It was the first time our kids get to see a hazelnut tree and they were so excited. There are also red dates, persimmon and Chinese pear trees in the temple. There is also a magnificent standing Buddha statue beside the main shrine."
Interesting ,"We visited the place for the sake of photography, nice garden, buildings, and friendly ppl we met there. "
Big Buddha!,Lovely temple on the edge of of Gangnam. I was there late afternoon and the light was marvelous and all was quite peaceful. Well worth the visit. 
Tranquil haven,"Although quite a bit of a trek outside the main downtown area, the metro will whisk you here for the largest temple in the city. Some of the halls are quite new and others (mainly those hidden in the hills) are much older. Regardless, you need to remove your shoes to visit any of the shrines inside. The vast statue that dominates the hillside is the main attraction. Free to visit."
Classic old Korean architecture,"Got off the hop on, hop off bus on a whim at this stop. Great experience seeing monks in action. Old architecture from 1800s. Very cool experience."
Night Visit ,"This is the top thing to do in Seoul in my opinion. Visited many temples around the world and this by far the best.It appeals to the senses - there is quiet chanting in one of the halls, cool wind drifts down from the hill behind, air crispy with the scent of trees and incense, prayer halls interpersed among the hill instead of a single imposing one.Beyond the explanable senses, i actually feel the holiness here. I am not a buddhist, but i get this sense of rest and anticipation sitting in the dark in front of the maitreya bodhisattva. "
WOW! Peace and Tranquility in city center,The Bongeunsa Temple is a place of history and is being renovated as I had a walk around. It is a great place of peace and tranquility in the midst of city center and opposite of the COEX mall. It has many small temples and a main one where there are prayers held apart from many other prayer hall. There is a large Buddha statue in the middle. It is dedicated to the Korean Buddhism sect and comes across as a great place to visit in the evening. Enjoy the wonderful place when in Seoul.
Bustling to Serene,"I first went to visit the Coex (Giant Mall) and had to take a step out half way through because of the amount of people there. What did I find? Across the street this wonderful place that was quiet and with limited amount of people. The traditional style of the buildings, beautiful statues, and simple walking paths around the area. This was a peaceful (and fun) afternoon especially to escape the ""concrete jungle"" and to take a moment of refreshing calmness from the fast-paced lifestyle in Seoul. *As of Oct '17 - There was no entrance fee and no restroom fee*"
Quiet place,"An Buddhist temple near Coex - International Exposition Complex. It is a peaceful place, a must see in Seoul!"
Beautiful,Spent a half day walk around enjoying the Serenity in a Concrete Jungle. This is a wonderful place of Peace and Quiet in a Bustling City of Glass and Steel
An attraction you should not miss,"This Buddhist temple is over a thousand years of age and is quite well kept and maintained. While the temple is only a few blocks away from a shoping mall, it is rather peaceful and quiet inside the temple. There are about 13 buildings / structures in the temple and be prepared to allow 2 hours or more for this visit. Further, if you happen to go there after 5 pm, try to extend your stay until 8 pm because when the lanterns are on (there are hundreds of lanterns near the temple entrance and in the main compound of the temple), you would suddenly find yourself wandering in a ""temple of lanterns"". How to go there: it is about 500 m away from the Bongeunsa Station (Line 9)."
Serene temple near Coex Mall,"We visited the temple in April after shopping for a bit in the Coex Mall. Luckily, when we went there weren't too many other tourists. The grounds are beautiful and really peaceful despite being in the middle of an urban area. The decorations are colorful and ornate. There are statues throughout the entrance area as well as a canopy made of colorful lanterns. There are also many beautiful buildings with alters that people go to to pray. We saw two cats that seem to call the temple home too. My favorite part was the giant buddha statue in the back."
peaceful,"Korea temples are known for their architecture and tinge of the ancient feel. This temple is no exception. Situated at Bongeunsa Temple Station (Seoul Subway Line 9), Exit 1 - it is very accessible. There's a little shop near the entrance, vegetarians can purchase some vegetarian beverages and dried foodstuff too. "
Peacefull place in otherwise busy Seoul,"Place is located in the always busy Gamnang area. Entrance is free, and the area is quite calm and nice. While for me Seoul seems as very western oriented country, it was good to be able to see actual old culture.Also place seems to be very popular for the koreans"
Nice place to visit ,The temple is beautiful but unfortunately they are doing some renovation now and with the construction cite and the noise ....it makes it kind of hard to enjoy the peaceful place. 
Beautiful Lotus blossoms,"This was a beautiful temple, but since it is an active temple it felt a little awkward touring it. We weren't sure where we could and couldn't go, but definitely beautiful."
Visited during the start of Buddah's birthday celebration,Located right across the Coex Mall in Gangnam. Lovely place decorated with colorful lanterns. It was a beautiful sunny day as we walked around the temple grounds.
Peace in mind,"The temple could not be missed when visiting Seoul. Just out of Exit 1 of Bongeunsa station was a beautiful temple located on a hill. The main entrance was impressive with hundred of mini lotus pond. Besides, the temple was decorated beautifully with thousands of white lanterns. Walking around and sitting silently, I found peace of mind to myself."
Long way but worth to go!,"It was longest trip i had in Seoul ( considering that i usually get lost and find something interesting on my way which isnt described in any bookguides) BUT definetly worth to go! Temple is at mountain and to get there you need few changes of metro and walk and catch a bus- if you go alone. Better to have someone who can speak korean, because when you get at bus stop - you need to ask which one goes to temple and which one goes down - there is only one bus stop for both ways. Near bus stop i didnt see any youngsters and old people definitely dont speak english. Going backt to temple! Really really nice pagodas, arhitecture is worth to see, mountain and pease around- worth to feel. Even if youre lucky- you can hear birth singing. When you reach destinations - main temple place, you will see many people in there. Probably half of them is for prayer, half as a tourist and some of them also stay at temple. This temple have something which calls templestay. You can see and experience how monks live, eat with them and meditate. I was lucky- i sow 2 monks walking around pagodas! Anyway - even if it is hard to get there - visit definetly! If not for temple then for mountain where temple is and forest and small river near. "
Tranquillity,Spent a couple of hours moving around the temple complex. Lots of people in prayer at the Temple. The temple offers a temple stay where you can stay overnight at the temple and learn about Buddism.
Lovely temple experience,"This was well worth the time and price. I learned a lot and experienced temple activities with people from around the world - tea, meditation, a craft and a well-explained visit."
Peace in the middle of the city,Amidst the chaos of Gangnam is this beautiful temple. There is a sense of serenity when you step inside its courtyard. I heard the monks chant and saw people worship. The colorful llaterns welcome you and then at the top of the steps are thousands of white laterns with the wishes and devotions of many Buddhists hang close to the heavens. The temple was founded in 794 and was moved to it's current location during the Joseon Dynasty (1500's). Lots of history here. I love to meditate and practice yoga regularly so this place was really nice to visit for me.This is a must see if you are already touring Gangnam. You are just minutes away from shopping at Hyundai Department store and other cool areas of areas of Gangnam.
This is the temple to visit,"If you have very little time -- this is the temple to visit. Such an oasis and they even offer you accomodation if you enquire ahead. I stayed in Seoul so I organised a GangNam day in which we took a bus from Namdaemun direct to GangNam central (takes 20 mins) -- have lunch.You can walk 2 kms to the Sejong Tombs (which is on the way to Bonguensa) or you can take a subway ride. I was hot and lazy: i took the subway. After the tombs, we walked 700m to the subway and took another 5 mins subway ride to Bonguensa Temple.Tip #1: Download the Seoul Subway app which will tell you what buses and trains to take.Tip #2:Download Maps.me app offline version so you can walk around and find the pesky bus stationsTip #3: The train back from Bonguensa can take you directly to Seoul, MyeungDong or Namdaemun"
Very cool Temple in the middle of the hustle and bustle of Seoul,If you are staying south of the river then it's a must stop. It's a practicing temple. You will here monks chanting and people worshiping. It's a big place to explore and soak in.
Working temple with impressive statue,"The lanterns and large Buddha statue are interesting to see, however this is working temple so it did feel appropriate to look inside. The outside was very similar to the Joyse temple in Insadong. The lotus offerings at this time of year was a bonus.Can easily combine your visit with Olympic Park or Gangnam district, both of which are close by.Thanks for the vote if you found this review helpful."
A second visit to Bongeunsa,"I was so happy to be able to return to Seoul after five years and experience Bongeunsa again. This is a wonderful welcoming Buddhist temple located right in the heart of Samseong Dong / Coex area that allows for a quick respite from the hustle and bustle. The people are welcoming even if you are not familiar with the rituals. The entire grounds are decorated with colorful ribbons and paper lanterns. It is a very calming contrast to the modern urban world beyond its gates. It was also nice to see some renovations and expansion in progress, we look forward to another visit in the future ."
Very peace and calm in city,"Its Temple is opposite the Coex, a convention hall. When enter to main gate, colorful lanterns are floatting in the air, So tidy and beautiful! Inside the temple, there is an information counter, main building for praying, small building beside for activity and the stair for go up is behind this small building!For the Big Bhuddha, just walk up. So nice place, take a deep breath for very nice weather there!!!PS for tourists should be polite and do respect to the sacred place or statues. I think they don't restrict to the very short clothing but we wore T-shirt and covered-knee pants with sport shoes(walking support, Fine)."
Temple tour,"Had joined the temple tour, held every Thursday 2 pm, 20,000 won. Its all worth it. Our Korean guide tried her very best to explain in English. Must do in Seoul."
Calmness in busy city,"Fortunate to see the temple area with snow and without. What a calmness in the heart of a bustling area of Seoul! The grounds are beautiful and you'll forget you are across the street from a convention center.We spent about 1 hour walking the grounds. It was fairly romantic with the snow covered trees actually. It was great to just walk across the street from meetings and a busy shopping area to relax in the temple. Recommend more as a respite from a hectic day rather than a must see spot. If you are at the convention center, take the time to go."
Temple ,A nice and peaceful temple in the middle of the city (like everything else in Seoul that is in the city....peaceful or not). People pray here so be quite. It was worth a visit...I like culture and history. I mindfulness I give this temple 4 of 5. The metro station has same name as the temple it self. Easy to get here.
"Nice traditional spot in the heart of Gangnam, Seoul","The spot is Buddhist temple located in the middle of skyscrapers Gangnam. But this temple is kind of very valuable downtown park suitable for 20-30 min. walk. As long as you wear neat clothes in common sense, you can enter the place (There is no charge for entrance!) You can enjoy some old fashioned Korean Buddhist temple architectures and some quiet moods from religious faculties. They have big statue of Buddha (Maitreya). And all those old fashioned architecture and statue are mostly from modern times within 50yrs from now on. (Though the temple built almost 1,000yrs ago most of original buildings were burnt over fires). So the temple is not the kind of destination you should be, but worth visiting for short break, if you stay near to this temple."
Half day tour,"This was included in a half day tour. It's near the COEX center so easy to see it if you are headed to the aquarium. If you only have time for one Temple though go see Jogyesa, the chief temple"
Very serene and quiet temple,"You can take subway directly to bongeunsa station and you will arrive right before the temple. You can spend around 1 hour here, sight seeing and pray. There is a COEX shopping mall across the road which is excellent for shopping and food. "
A feel of Korean religion,It was amazing to see how Koreans take time to pray at this temple in the middle of the day. The place was so serene and relaxing. So many great spots to take photos of too. 
Relaxing spot,"This is a very quiet, beautiful and relaxing place to visit. I highly enjoyed walking there with friends"
Fantastic,A very quiet spiritual plave to visit.The Buddha was very special.The paintings were stunning too.
An island of serenity in Gangnam,"Across the street from the western modern COEX Mall, this was a nice 180. Dressed up for Buddha's Birthday in early May this is a nice colourful walk in the park. A large Buddha statue has a prime location. This is on the #9 subway line also so a short ride from many Gangnam locations."
Early morning visit,"Beautiful garden and a nice place to see how the traditional temple and the modern city mix. I went in the very early morning and it was just getting a few visitors, I suspect that it can get very busy during the day and into the early evening. I needed more than 20 minutes I had there but didn't have the time unfortunately."
Peaceful corner of Seoul,I visits the temple after reading various reviews and I didn't regret it. It was the most peaceful spot right in the middle of the city. Don't forget to visit the Big Buddha at the back of the temple overlooking the city. Really tranquil place to visit
Beautiful and unique!,"I was in Seoul for 2 weeks and this is one of my favorite stops! It was a lucky random find during our walk around Gangnam. Beautiful area any person, regardless of spiritual beliefs, can appreciate!"
Peace,"I'm very serious about the following: this place might be one of the most peaceful places on earth!Whether Buddhist or not, you will find a place for relaxation and connection with yourself or whoever you believe in. Just make sure to follow and respect the common rules (such as shoe wearing in certain areas).I found quite interesting to see the contest between the traditional and spiritual that represents the complex and all the modernity that surrounded it. "
Big Buddha Statue,if you go to here you can take picture with big buddha statue and this place close to COEX Mall so if you go here you can go to COEX Mall too
Scenic temple in the city,"We walked here from CoEx as it's only 5 mins. The temple complex is on the side of a hill, so you get views of the city. A few cherry trees were in bloom which brightened up the surroundings. We were too late for a guided tour but we just enjoyed walking around anyway.Well worth visiting if you come to CoEx."
Perfect place to feel the inner calmness!,"Scenic place, you feel 'different' when you visit it. I recommend joining prayers in the main temple."
Serene sanctuary in the middle of the city,"This palace is much smaller than Gyeongbukgung but I find it to be more pleasant as there are more trees around the courtyards. The main hall is surprisingly small. If you have time to visit only one palace, go to Gyeongbukgung but if you happen to be around City Hall area, do drop by for a peaceful stroll. "
A peaceful ancient temple,"A peaceful ancient temple in the midst of busyness. Visited the temple in the late afternoon. Met with colourful lanterns and lotus carvings, as well as the early spring bloom."
"Quiet, gorgeous and peaceful place","I visited this site on a quick visit to Seoul. I wanted to see a Buddhist temple and learn a little about Korean culture in general. I found this place absolutely stunning. The buildings are magnificent, the giant statue of the Buddha breath taking. I took my time to stroll around at my leisure and felt very relaxed, everyone is doing their thing so you can really explore freely. A wonderful visit if you are looking for a calm place."
An urban oasis. ,Ask for a tour. It's free and you will learn so much more than if you just stroll the grounds. And you might just make a new friend like I did. 
My fav place in Seoul,"I visited this place twice. Is a special temple with an unique atmosphere, between modernity and tradition. The soul of Seoul."
Beautiful,"We went into the temple when it was already dark out,it must have been 19.00 or close to it so that's the time I'm recommending you show up as it felt like just the right time to be there. There was the sound of prayers echoing throughout the grounds and we sat by the enormous statue at the very back of the temple. The light along the walls reflected on the marble floor and made it look like water and the drifting sounds of the chants made for one of the best experiences I had in Seoul. I just wish people (tourists) were more respectful! It clearly said no photos all throughout the temple however some people had their cameras right in front of people that were praying,"
Unique Experience,"This was one of my favorite places to visit. The palaces in Seoul are interesting but the temple was more so because it is a working temple. The grounds were alive with monks and worshippers. You can hear monks chanting and see people prostrating to the large Buddha towards the back of the grounds and in the main worship area. I was there a few days before the national college entrance exams and there were many visitors to the temple. There was an energy to the place, but it was also very peaceful."
Good escape from the metro-ness of the city,It was a good short visit but i heard you can spend a night there during the weekends and learn about meditation. Cant verify it though.
Chance to see a working temple,This temple complex is opposite the COEX shopping centre. There are a lot of buildings and explanations on leaflets. There are opportunities to light candles and present offerings. There is also the tallest stone statue in Korea. 
Some Intriguing Architecture,When I went there were a number of lanterns around. The temple is small and by far the most impressive aspect is the very large standing Buddha at the back. I didn't meet too many monks or staff but the few I did meet were very friendly.
Not great on a cold day,"Was nice enough place to look around and see. A little village right in the middle of the metropolis. But we were there on a freezing cold windy day and didn't fully appreciate it. So if you're popping into COEX across the road, and it's a warm day, take a look. Free entry. "
Buddhist Temple at Gangnam,"One of the 2 attractions I enjoyed most on our visit to Gangnam. Went there at around 6pm and the gates are still open. Glad we visited the place at night as the huge standing Buddha looks stunning with the lights on and the mountains perfectly placed at the background.., so photogenic! Admission is free, printed English guides are provided, and you can enter the temples. Picture taking is allowed. Just observe silence since this is a place for worship. COEX is just across the street, so you can do shopping after."
Impressive!,Beautiful Temple. Very peaceful and scenic. Definitely worth checking it out if you are in the Gangnam area
Temple surrounded by city,There is easy access to the temple through the station with the same name. It is a beautiful temple surrounded by the city. Worth the visit. There is a huge statue of Buddha which can be easily missed as it is at the back.
Amazing,Wonderful temple. Free admission. Very beautiful and scenic. People at the gate were very friendly and helpful.
Nice temple with beautiful lanterns,"A quiet place to hide from dynamic Gangnam-go district, though it can be a little intimidating for those who are sightseeing. The lanterns are beautiful! "
Old Temple in the center of city,"Bongeunsa temple near the business center in the city center. Beautiful complex of Buddhist temples in a large park. Peace silence, people dedicated to prayer and a lot of tourists. Relax and enjoy the visit. During my visit could be seen and sculpture exhibition."
"Beautiful overhead paper lanterns to the great ""standing Buddha""","""Quite mesmerizing"" was the sight of these rows of beautiful white paper lanterns overhead stretching from the entrance gate all the way to the first temple building raised up on concrete pillars, and more white paper lanterns along with red ones are to be seen in that building & the one right behind (pretty much connected to the first building) on the way to the inner temple grounds where all the way at the back is a great ""standing Buddha"" with a square-plate hat (a pretty ""unique"" design of a Buddha statue really!) on a pedestal with also big carved sculptures around its base. Some views of the city from near the big Buddha (which is on somewhat of a high ground) are alright too although there's not much of a skyline to speak of in this area pretty far to the south of the city (across the wide Han River) from the hustle & bustle of the downtown area in the north in the vicinity of the palaces. And yes, what's ""really great"" about this temple is that it stays open late; I only arrived at pretty close to 6 pm and they were still open (temples in Japan for example, from my experience, all close at about 5 pm) although a monk was hitting a gong or something inside a temple building at about 6 20 pm which I'm not sure was a signal for closing.Coming by subway, the nearest station is Bongeunsa Station (the same name as this temple) on Line 9, and it's a mere 3-minute-or-so walk to the temple entrance gate (with its four big guard statues) after getting out of the station."
Very traditional,"A must visit, its a temple that is still in use so its great to see the traditional Buddhists walking around. Also a good break from the hustle of the city. "
serene place in city,"you will find this place for your Buddhist respect. Local Korean come to pray with rice and beans or paper lantern, donate money for temple maintenance. It's full of colorful lanterns. "
Traditional Temple,I was impress with the art of this temple..no entrance fee..we came inside..through labyrinth of lotus see inside the temple and got out..no clue this temple history...
Beautiful Temple,"Beautiful Budhist Temple older than a thousand year, close to Bongeunsa Station ( Subway Line 9 ) Good for Visit"
"A working temple, never free from traffic noise","Unfortunately, greater Seoul has grown all around this old centre of Korean Buddhism. The grounds are quite spacioius (there's even a lovely wooded hill behind), but wherever you wander, you're never quite free from traffic noise.This is a functioning temple, not a mere tourist attraction, so parts of it are constantly being remodelled. It's not quite as ""romantic"" as one might hope.Nevertheless, it makes for an interesting visit, especially if you also cross the road to compare it with the COEX convention centre, a temple of another kind: to globalisation and commerce.To get there take the metro to Bongeunsa station and follow the signs."
Amazing and free!,"We spent an amazing afternoon here with the family. There are so many things to see that it can take hours to get through everything! The flowers, lanterns, and multiple smaller temples are worth seeing. This location is right across from the fun COEX Mall."
Bongeunsa Temple,You can pay for a tour to the Temple but it's $45 each. Alternative is 45 minutes on a train at a fraction of the cost. Metro is easy ans signs in English help. People at the station and information guides are as helpful.An interesting active temple so remember this as noise and going inside are restricted.
Lovely and peaceful spot in the city,"Beautiful, peaceful temple right across from the Coex mall. It opens at 3 am so it was the perfect place to visit when jet-lag kept waking us up early."
Peaceful temple blended in the city,"Just across the street from coex, this extremely beautiful temple just has it all.Peaceful and bewildering Buddhist temple which is quite large with a lot to see.Try being there early- at around 5am - to see the Buddhist prayers and get the calming sensation.It is well worth the visit and taking part in the activities."
Beautiful and scenery.,Beautiful and scenery.. Good to quiet one mind with the nice weather and beautiful. Feel so blessed and glad to have a chance to visit this temple. 
What an awesome experience! ,"A giant old asian castle. Close to the train station and incorporates a museum in the middle, some of it is still under construction but the place is massive so plenty to see"
Jewel in the crown,"This Buddhist temple, for me, was my biggest discovery in Seoul. with more than 1200 years of history, this place is clean, exquisitely beautiful and retains a surreal charm. One can attend the ceremonies and chants in the main hall, and I wish I had more time to spend here."
Temple Visit And Shopping,"Bongeunsa in Gangnam district, is a temple highly popular with tourists. It is very easy to go there with a metro station (Bongeunsa) right at the door-step of Bongeunsa Temple. This temple is said to be the largest temple in Seoul during the Joseon Period. After the temple visit, Coex Mall is just across the road. With the largest under-ground Mall in Asia, it is a good place to shop and to dine. The other end of the Coex Mall is linked directly to another metro station where you can visit Unesco Royal Tombs. Thereafter, you have many shopping and sightseeing options."
Peaceful Buddhist Temple in the middle of city,"Been here 3 times. This temple been around for >1000 years and there are plenty of precious relic including old paintings, buddhist sutras. Other than the main temple hall, there are quite a few small structures around the site. Dont be discourage when you see the hall is closed, not sure why it is always closed unlike temple in other countries, you can get in from the side door, but remember to remove your shoes. Once you are inside, you will see many people praying & meditating inside.On my first visit, an old man told me not to miss the lunch because it is only 1000 Won but I already had lunch. My second trip, we just missed the lunch. We went there again the next day at 11.30am and there was a queue of hundreds of mostly old people. We followed the queue, paid the money, picked up the utensils, and the volunteers will serve you rice, kimchi, dried vegetables & hot soup all in the same bowl. Simple food but heart warming food."
"worth taking part in the ""temple life program"" that is run on Thursday afternoons","the templelife program allows you to follow the activities of the temple, take part in the guided tour within the temple, understand better Korean culture and buddhism, experience Korean tea ceremony and zen meditation."
Bongeunsa Temple,"Bongeunsa is a beautiful temple area which is literally across the street from COEX Mall. You can get there by car taxi or subway(any station near COEX) Thankfully it's not on a mountain as many Korean temples are. There main building has some beautiful features inside including religious statues. There are a number of buildings around the complex and I have no idea/don't remember what they were for but they were architecturally similar to just about every temple in Korea. Frankly, with the exception of a few, most temples in Korea look exactly the same. This one is surrounded by skyscrapers and the largest indoor mall in Asia. As a resident of the area it's a peaceful escape. There is a huge buddha statue towards the back and many historic and architectural features around the complex. Please keep in mind, you'll be on temple grounds, be respectful and quiet. You can go nuts with your camera. There are some temple activities like temple stay but I have no interest in those so can't comment. There are many places to eat nearby especially in the mall. I personally like to go to Brooklyn Burger, which is a few blocks away, for some of the best burgers in Seoul. I highly recommend a visit if you're in the area. However, if you've already been to some Korean temples and you're short on time...meh reconsider. One last thing, avoid going on weekends and holidays if possible."
Feel your soul filled with peace,"From the very entrance you could sense the seperation from the hustle and bustle of the surrounding neighborhood. When I visited there were renovation works, but the route was designed as serpent, when you go through a stunning looks of many lotuses. Take your time to visit the several pagodas, sit a while in silence while gazing at the breath taking ceililng or just watch the random worshippers pray. You could have a nice stroll between the halls, and might gat lucky to watch to monks praying their mantras. If you like, you can get souvenirs and buddhist religious artifacts from the shop in the entrance. Recommended!"
Nice place,"Just across the busy COEX you can find this oasis. Sometimes monks are praying. As everything is written in Korean and i am not a Buddhist, it was impossible to follow anything. So i just enjoyed the tranquility of the temples. Wonderful."
Recommend healing time even for 10 minutes ...,This historical temple is located just across COEX-mall where Intercontinental hotel and Park Hyatt hotel are just foot-step away... Temple buildings are well balanced with old tress and Buddhist legacies and there is a very nice short walking trail behind the main temple. Two lilac trees over thousand years are must-see ones. 
Nice temple to visit,"This temple, coincidentally and conveniently located very close to the COEX, is a great place to visit and see an ancient Korean temple."
Buddhism In Gangnam,"A majestic Temple where Buddhism is the main religion back hundreds of years ago. Very big temple where the architectural portion are still very much preserve. It is located opposite COEX. Korea Line 9, Bongeunsa Station. Has to maintain peace and quiet in the temple to prevent disturbing Buddhist praying."
Bongeunsa,Very peaceful place to be. English guides and tours are available. Free entrance too. In the middle of Gangnam
An actual working breathing temple!,"In busy Gangnam it's an oasis of calm. Not overly large it's a nice respite from a bustling city. You can wander around taking care not to disturb people at prayer. If you can plan it, around sunset the monks work the drums and gongs - well worth experiencing. Attraction is free tho' donations are accepted."
nice area to see,"hopped a cab based on a TripAdvisor recommendation and was not disappointed. wandered around for a few hours, easily. the grounds are kept beautifully. quiet, serene, not overcome with tourists (at least not on the day I visited) a gem in the heart of Seoul. "
Peaceful place,"The bongeun temple is next to the Coex in samsung-dong. It's the most biggest temple in seoul & has a long history. You take the line 2, off at Samsung station & exit 6. No entrance fee. "
"The oldest Temple in Seoul , we were told .A very big Buddha in the Center and you can prayer and pay your Respect .","A great place to visit , we felt peaceful and quietness , a very big Buddha in a huge space you and pray to if you like , and pic for your memory to bring back . An A , for us . "
Beautiful place,"I went to Bongeunsa Temple on May and there was a festival of Buddha. So they held a festival for a few days and so many people came and pray, also they wrote down their wishes in a piece of paper and hung the paper on top. This temple is such a beautiful place in the middle of town. You can see so many tall building around this temple, and it;s just fascinating."
"Opposite CoeX, tranquil zone","There are many cultural and religion activities all year round in this temple complex, location is very good on the side of hill in Gangnam area with concrete forest.the grand hall is extraordinarily beautiful, the gift shop is also interesting. Big Bodhisatrava towering the temple with background of foliages chaning colors is beautiful. "
Beautiful and Peaceful,"In the middle of bustling Gangnam, it is a peaceful place to wander and enjoy. I am not buddhist but I enjoy seeing the different temples, their history and the rich tradition throughout. It is currently under construction so not as peaceful as normal but still a sight to behold. Wander the grounds to see the many small buildings for worship and the amazing, huge statue in the back. It is free and easy to get to from the Coex shopping area."
Conveniently located to the Coex Mall,"Free admission and feel free to walk around the numerous buildings. I didn't go inside the buildings, since they were being used for services."
peaceful,This is a perfect peaceful oasis in the middle of a modern city which is Seoul. The statures were beautiful and a relaxing pond with trickling water. It is an functioning temple so there was a service going on. So no loud picture taking or screaming kids.There is a little coffee shop to get some Korean snacks and drinks with real good coffee just outside entrance.
Oasis in the middle of the city,"For the attendee of any conference at Coex, it is difficult to miss this compound of temples. It is right across the north entrance of Coex. It is beautiful from the outside and impressive from the inside. There is no entrance fee. A small buddhist store and a volunteer tour guide's tent are right at the entrance. I opted not to get a tour guide because my intention was some silent reflection. There was a ""service"" going on when I visited. There was a prayer leader leading a group of practitioners in song and meditation. The music/singing could be heard throughout the temple grounds but it did not preclude silent reflection as the music was conducive to it. There were many people tendingto the gardens and ponds when I was there. I do not know if this is a daily thing or just a coincidence. The grounds are very well kept. Some of the trees looked really old. The pond with the lotus flowers was lovely. They don't mind tourists taking pictures as long as this is done quietly and unobtrusively. I highly recommend a visit."
Lovely spiritual place,Beautiful temple buildings with lovely gardens.The big Buddha was awesome.The staff were very friendly asking where we came from.Had some lovely gifts in the shop
Bongeunsa Temple,"It has many areas for praying and it has the biggest buddha sculpture. Traditionally you should bring some food to the temple as a part of the praying. People generally bring a bottle of water or rice but you can get creative (your country's famous biscuit for example) When you are there dont judge and dont talk so loudly please. Explore, have fun, have the bliss!"
Must see temple,"When you are in the Gangnam Area this temple is a must see. It got some nice buildings and statues. Do remember that this is a holy site for the locals so be respectful when visiting. Combine it with other events in the Gangnam district. for example go to the Olympic park first, then Coex mall, then this temple"
Breath taking,What a beautiful historical culture i was there in a raining and windy day i wish is was sunny day i hope i come back next time with a nice weather !!!!!! 
Old Buddhist temple,Impressive statue which remains you the splendor of the old days. Some people can pray or just meditate.
Tranquility in the city,The surrounding of the temple was very beautifully decorated. Full bloomed lotus could be seen at the entrance. Quite many locals were doing their prayers and the chanting added serenity to the whole place.
Impressive Buddha and temple complex,"The real attraction of this temple is the 75-foot tall standing Buddha located on an elevated site in the very back of the temple complex. Be prepared to climb some steep steps to get there, although I did see the locals walking on a dirt road on the left side which looked a lot less difficult. The buildings composing the temple complex are actively used for worship and study. Visiting Bongeunsa Temple felt like an authentic experience."
Huge Buddha,"This temple was close to our hotel so we checked it out after a day of sight-seeing. Not the most impressive find. Most of it was closed, with quite a lot of partitioning - perhaps they were renovating or there was a festival on? The enormous Buddha is stunning, but other than that I wouldn't recommend searching for it."
One of the most beautiful temples I've been to,"Not much to say - way worth the ride to gangam. Go in the morning hours to see the chants, or better yet -- do a temple-stay! it's amazing. "
Serene Temple in a busy City,"Came here on a rainy day, beautiful temples. In the center there are 4 huge bells to call all four directions. A huge statue of the future Buddha stands within a large circle outdoors. They have a lovely shop with all sorts of souvenirs & Buddhist supplies including clothing."
Divine and serene place,"I was in Seoul on an official trip and had some of my colleagues with me. I had meeting in COEX which is a mall and has many a things like offices, the famous coex aquarium, branded shops, etc in it. I was very interested to visit the Bonguensa Temple as I love to visit the religious places of different religions and country. I like to see how in other countries the Lord is worshipped. Hence, I decided to visit this place which was very near to the COEX Mall. My colleagues chose to keep visiting the mall. The moment I stepped into this place it was very calm and a divine feel was coming. In the entrance there were lotus plants every where and the God was also being offered Lotus. The local people were buying grains and other things to offer the God. I went there in the evening and that time the monk was offering the prayers and then he rang the big bell. The sound of it was giving peace to me. I saw how the locals are offering prayers and then did the same way. In the premises of the temple there was a garden, a place where the monks stay, a very big statue of the Gautam Buddha and there was a Goddess also who was resembling our Indian Godess. The place was very beautiful and calm. A must visit if you are around the place."
An oasis of calm,"Surrounded by busy traffic avenues and high rise building, this is a complex of several buildings (diverse uses including accommodation) interspersed with charming gardens. Didn't have much time there and arrived too late for the Thursday tour - you have to be there by 1.50pm - so will try for that next time."
An Oasis,"This is in a very busy business district. It is an oasis. Relaxing and contemplative. After a long day or early in the morning, replenish your soul. "
Renovated,"There are extensive renovation works going on right now and the result of the renovation are beautiful, vivid colours on wood. Nice greenery and some special features make it worth a visit."
spiritual place !!,it was nice to go to this place seeing persons praying. it s near the COEX and the Lotte duty free. I enjoyed beeing there
Really enjoyable and special ,"I would definitely recommend going here - quaint temple for some peace and tranquility in the midst of a busy city !! Pity about the construction busy going on there which was a bit annoying. Nonetheless , it was very enjoyable and the lilies are spectacular. "
Beautiful and serene,"Very nice temple and monastery for peaceful reflection! The view from the top of the hill is quite serene. The big statue of Buddha, architecture and lotus flowers are beautiful."
Beuaitful Temple in the middle of Seoul,"Nice area to visit the history of Korea in the middle of Seoul Metropolitan. Active Temple, so please be respectful while you are there as services are always being held. Great place to visit for an hour."
A little gem in a busy city,"Bongeunsa is by far my favorite temple Seoul. It's located just across the street from COEX Mall near Gangnam. I've been there multiple times over my 8 years here in Korea because it's just so beautiful. After the renovation of the grounds they did a few years back, it's even better than before."
"Historical, well preserved and a treasure of 1st Avatamsaka Sutra in wooden blocks is here","Over 1,200 years of historical BUDDHIST temple in Seoul, dignified the long journey of Buddhism was introduced to Korea. Very well preserved ancient wooden flooring and building structures. Most of all, a treasure of the 1st edition of Avatamsaka Sutra in wooden blocks were well preserved here. "
Beautiful,This is a very beautiful temple you come come here for prayers and all. Is huge and really a great experience. Is also right across from the Coex building. We came on a very hot day but still manage to enjoy the experience and later went to cool off at Coex.
Beautiful temple across co-ex mall,"If you visit co-ex mall, don't miss this boutique temple. It's small but beautiful. The water lily flowers add the uniqueness of this temple. It's worth visiting it."
Beautiful!,Such a beautiful temple. It is a lot bigger than what I was expecting. It was super hot to walk around though as there is little shade. But genuinely beautiful and an information sheet on it in English!
A must visit place,"If you are in seoul, this is a place you don't want to miss. A moment of silence in the middle of busy city life.... Enjoyed the view from the temple"
Beautifull temple,"The temple itself would deserve 5 stars. It's very beautifull, but when I was there their was construction work next to it. So the noise disrubted the piece and tranquil place."
Quite Spot in Gangnam,After having been looking around in COEX that it is the right spot for a change of mind and same peace. Large Buddha statue in the back. 
"Beautiful temple, more than expected!!!","We took a cab from Myeongdong to Bongeunsa temple, it was absolutely gorgeous. Beautiful and peaceful temple with full of Lotus in summer, far from our imagination. Strongly recommend to everyone!"
Nice relaxing place,Spent an hour here just unwinding and gathering some energy. The singing in the temples was really nice and something I hadn't had a chance to experience in Europe. 
zen,A very beautiful place to go. Quite calm and restful though close to the COEX and the crowd. We were charmed by all the lotus flowers and the ancient buildings
Some peace in the middle of the financial district,Came to to relax from the city as well as to see the interior of the temple.It is a huge complex but amazingly calm
A nice temple heritage,This is a nice temple located directly across the road opposite COEX mall. This heritage temple is a nice attraction for those who is keen to know Korean Buddhism culture.
Surprising ,I was surprised by the beauty and location of this ancient temple being so close to the hussle and bustle of Seoul and being so close to the COEX building. As soon as one enters the ambience and tranquillity is noticeable even though it was packed with tourists. Definitely worth a visit. Free of charge too. 
Very nice temple ,"The temple is located opposite COEX. There is a big Buddha statue and a few spots to explore. You can also buy candle, rice or grain to offer to the Buddha at the front door. I went on the day that there were lot of local chanting. So I missed a chance to get into the main Buddha hall (Daewoongjeon) however, to see lot of local chanting is a nice experience. You can book for a temple tour or walk around by yourself. There is an English info available. "
Quiet garden of Eden in the business district ,"Great place to visit, if you are in this Coex business district or in the area. Active buddhist temple that takes up quite a lot of space in the neighborhood. Flyers available Guide you and for further information are available in English and the languages.A moment of relaxation in an otherwise busy city. Wonderful. "
Beautiful Landscape and Window Into Temple Life,I was at a conference across the street at COEX and this was my first attraction to visit in the city. The layout of the temple was similar to another temple I had visited but the buildings were all their own. I loved seeing the daily rituals of the temple going on around me as I walked the grounds. The lanterns everywhere were beautiful and the entrance with all the lotus flowers in the big wooden pots were beautiful too. I forgot I was in a big city for a bit!
Peaceful temple and monastery,"This temple is right opposite CoEx mall in Gangnam district, such a contrast to the busy city life of Seoul. It was really peaceful inside with the monks chanting their prayers and some devotees just sitting in meditation in different parts of the temple/monastery. There's a status of standing Budhha at the back of the temple which is beautiful."
Lovely temple,The temple wasn't as large as I expected but it still had plenty to see for 1-2 hours. It is not that peaceful as it is located right next to a busy street and has a parking lot full of cars and buses but is still beautiful.The area consists of a few larger buildings and many smaller houses. Remember to respect the locals as it is a religious place.
Not the original architectures,"An over 1200 years historical Buddhist temple. Unfortunately, most of the buildings were ruined or burnt. The current architectures were rebuilt after the Korea War. Behind the main hall, there is a newly erected (1996), 23 meter tall statue of the Maitreya Buddha. The temple provides religion related activities for tourists-- meditation, temple stay program,…etc. A nice place for Buddhists and temple lovers."
Worth Visiting While in Seoul,"If you are in the vicinity of COEX in Seoul, I highly recommend visiting the nearby Bongeunsa Temple, located across from the main COEX convention center and conveniently located off the metro line 9 stop with the same name. I visited on a Sunday morning and the place was full of worshippers. While I did not enter any of the buildings where the services were taking place, it was nice to hear the drums and chants of the people at these services as I wandered around and took pictures. The architecture and paintings on the buildings were interesting and there was information in various languages, to include English. They offer temple stays if you are in to things like that. There also is a large out door central area with a big statue and cushions where one can pay their own respects. It was very peaceful and beautiful. Altogether I am very happy I visited and would recommend visitors to Seoul check it out, especially if attending something or shopping/eating/going to the aquarium at the nearby COEX. About an hour is sufficient to view the complex, more if you sit and soak in the atmosphere."
No time for tourism; a quick special place to visit when at convention center (Coex),"I was at a meeting at the Coex convention center. Except for my morning run (and Korean women apparently don't run, at least in Seoul, so I was quite out of place). I was there for work and had very little spare time. My best experience was running (okay, I walked at that point) through the Bongeunsa Temple which borders the convention center. Beautiful, peaceful, monks strolling temple grounds, chanting, the real deal: no one spoke any English! Recommended for a business traveler who wants a taste of Korea, with limited time."
A welcome respite in a busy city,"Visited Bongeunsa whilst attending a conference at COEX across the road. A welcoem respite to the activity of the conference.When I visited the way into the temple was between a path of water lilies in large barrels up to the first Hall - and as this is a working Bhuddist temple the hall was full of devotees chanting as where the other halls around the site. The different halls are architectural Korean buildings in their own right with highly decorated exteriors and interiors. There were lots of messages for the Gods hanging like an upside down carpet between some of the buildings, incense and shops to buy food for the Gods.There is also a bell and large drum pavilions, a large open air statue and if you wish to do so you can book to stay here and experience the life of a monk. An hour or so will allow to enjoy the pleasures of this temple"
Beautiful temple in the middle of Gangnam,It's just beautiful and peaceful especially in the middle of busy Gangnam area. It's opposite COEX mall and not far from subway station. I think it's worth a visit if you are in the area. 
Beautiful temple,This was an amazing temple. When I went the temple was getting ready for Buddha's Birthday celebration so there were a lot of visitors and a lot of action. it was beautiful and very peaceful.
Gangnam's own centre of peace and tranquility,"Gangnam is busy and trendy and full of cool restaurants and hotels and shopping malls so it's great to have this temple complex so close. A short walk from Samseong subway station on Line 2 (exit 6), or Bongeunsa station on line 9 (exit 1). Even if you're not a Buddhist (I'm not) you won't fail to be struck by the peace of the place. The sounds of chanting from the various temple buildings. And a wooded hill behind it all just to sit and be. After all this is the main temple for Seon Buddhism - better known as Zen. "
Beautiful large Budha with an amazing temple,"This temple is centrally located in the Gingham district and is very beautiful. I walked to this place and spend some time. If you are in the area, it is a must visit. The temple has a huge statue of Budha."
The real deal,This is a beautiful temple that is USED! It was so nice seeing people praying. Such a peaceful place. I guess you can actually stay there and participate in the practices. We happen not to be buddhists. 
Beauty in the city,An easy stroll from the metro finds you at this classic temple. Do visit any time but especially during the lantern festival.
Peace and beauty in the heart of a busy city block,"I was very fortunate to visit Seoul just in time for Buddha's birthday. Hence the entire city was decorated in festive lanterns and lights. Bongeunsa Temple is situated very close to Gangnam, right across the street from the COEX Mall, and just a few blocks walk from the Park Hyatt, where I was staying. The temple staff are very polite, and I was treated to a wonderful volunteer led tour of the temple grounds with other English speaking tourists. They also had a number of fun celebratory activities, but also host a Temple Stay program as well as a day program on Thursday afternoons for tourists interested in learning more about Buddhism for a small fee (something like 20 USD). Highly recommended if you are in the area."
What a place ....,"So zen, so peaceful, so gorgeous, to make a break in a silly busy life ... Every place of this temple invites you to think about yourself and make a break."
Great place to see practicing Munks,We were shopping at local mall and this was across the street. It was great to be able to view the monks in the active temple
Tranquil ,"I've been to a few temples and this one is my favourite, it is so peaceful and you really feel like the spirits are there with you.Well worth the visit. "
So peaceful and gorgeous!,"This temple was so lovely, serene and peaceful. The architecture is exquisite. Walking through the grounds and listening to the chanting in background was so wonderful. "
A Great Experience,"Don't miss it, its in Gangnam, you can take the subway/metro to get there. Plan for at least 1 hour to see the entire property. It's very inspiring. "
Lovely place to walk around and enjoy,I was there the day before Buddha's Birthday and got to see all the colorful decorations they'd put up. Very nice and lovely place in the middle of town. Beautiful park area. Very peaceful.
My favourite temple,"I loved this temple, although in Asia all the temples are similar, but this one was different and was very peaceful, I loved watching people pray there, and took a lot of amazing pictures."
"Nice and beautiful, but not too special","There is a big Buddha, and it´s quite calm. If you are only in Seoul and can´t visit any temple in any of the several mountains, that it´s a nice location. It´s also special that it is in the middle of the metropolitan city."
Oasis in the middle of the city,"Right across the street from COEX. Beautiful and nicely kept temple. Nice break from the noisy street. Around lunch time, lots of office workers bring their lunches and eat in the gardens. Great place for pictures."
Tranquil boost admist the hype retail in Seoul,"Relatively easy to find, best to use the COEX exit as the temple is just across the road. Chantings was going on as part of the pre Wesak celebrations, lanterns were strung up. Wesak day celebration is a biggie in Seoul. There are a number of buildings including the main hall sprawled around the temple grounds. A must visit is the huge stone standing Matrieya Buddha, you can do some meditation in front of the statue."
Tranquil environment amidst Gangnam,"Located across the street from Intercontinental hotel. This temple is relatively easy to find. Peaceful and quiet. Temple ground has a lot of greenery. At the time of visit, the monks were chanting Diamond Sutra in the prayer halls. It was ok to enter and watch as long as one remained quiet and respectful. Architecture was interesting. I visited during the Lotus Lantern Festival. There were displays of big and small lanterns around the temple ground. This temple also offers a temple stay program. An excellent way to get away from it all. "
Worth a visit,"I was there a few weeks before Buddha's birthday. All the colourful lanterns were hung up and it was beautiful. The lilac trees were in bloom. Unfortunately due to the workers it was very dusty and noisy when I was there. On any other occasion, i'm sure the place would be quite tranquil."
Amazing- not to miss,I was staying across the street and went into this temple. I was so moved by its beauty. It was so beautiful and peaceful. I recommend everyone go and walk through. Also make a small donation so they can continue their work. So amazing.
serenity,Spent about 30 minutes walking the grounds and enjoying the peace and quiet away from the crowds. Did a little prayer too. Cherry blossoms were aplenty when I was there. I wish I had the time to do a temple stay program.
Nice place to visit,I am not a Buddist but I stayed at the Hotel across from the temple... I took a walk in the woods surrounding the temple and it was very peaceful... the grounds are well maintained and monks can be heard chanting.... 
Nothing special,"Quite honestly, I was very disappointed about this group of Temples. Not much to add other than say that the visit is not worth it unless you are staying at the hotel across the street."
"Very beautiful to visit, and FREE to enter!","This was probably the best attraction in all of Gangnam, considering that it was FREE. The temple grounds are lovely, and the architecture is stunning.I'd love to see this place lit up at night, I bet its gorgeous."
Temple in the middle of Seoul,"It is a temple that is situated atop a hill and you could get a nice view of Seoul from here, especially at night. A nice place to visit as it is quiet and calm."
"A quiet, peaceful moment. ","It's in the middle of Gangnam, but feels far from the busy streets. Try to visit in the morning, before the visiting crowds.  "
This Was a Highlight,It's a beautiful temple that is currently in use for worship. The sound of the monks chanting could be heard as I wandered among the buildings. Absolutely wonderful. 
Tranquility between buzz,"Bongeunsa Temple is a 1,200 year old temple located in Samseong-dong, Gangnam-gu, Seoul. Bongeunsa became the head temple of the Seon sect during the Joseon Dynasty, when the government supported Confucianism. The huge temple compound in present-day Gangnam. Must visit!"
Beautiful temple,"One of my favourite areas in Seoul. There’s this sense of peace whenever I walk around, and though it’s situated in one of the busier districts in Gangnam (Samsung) and is rather close COEX and some large hotels, it is never really very crowded. The temple is mid-sized and is lovely to walk around in, with really nice scenery and is especially beautiful in winter and spring (and possibly even in autumn). There’s also a temple stay program here and offers a glimpse into the teachings of Korean Buddhism. Definitely worth a visit, no entry fee is charged."
Tranquility in the heart of Seoul,"This temple compound is a beautiful place to spend an hour enjoying the calm of the buddhist culture. You can climb your way up the hill/steps through and around a variety of old and new buildings. Worshippers often have the doors closed, but you can sneak a peak in a respectful way when the door opens and closes. The trees and plants are gorgeous and make a spring or summer time visit all the better. It's easy to visit the COEX complex (including the aquarium) across the street if you feel the need to re-enter the urban world. The temple is worth a visit for sure."
Very nice,"Went here this morning to kill some time and it was very peaceful. The architecture was very cool. It's amazing that this place is in the middle of a very busy city. If you are on the arwa, you should stop by, you only need about an hour and it's free."
Beautiful Buddhist Temple ,I visited in early April just as the blossom was starting to bloom. The grounds were beautiful. The whole place is very peaceful and spiritual as it is an active temple. Looking out over the city from above the Buddha gives a great view. 
Beautiful and Serene,"Lots of preparations being done for Thursday's service, so there were a few large trucks and workers present. They were a bit of a distraction for pictures in some areas."
Buddhist temple in middle of busy city,Peaceful setting and wonderful to hear chanting throughout temple grounds. Beautifully preserved. Lots of smaller temples to pray in. Walking though grounds to see budding Spring flowers was wonderful.
Sanctuary,"First, it is free. Second, this is a little oasis in the middle of Seoul. Buddhist chants are heard throughout the site. Blossoms on the trees, with the dullness of the rest of the grounds, adds a pretty contrast."
Peace full Buddhist Temple,We had a quick visit to this temple which is right across the Intercontinental hotel. Since it was End of winter not much crowd It is beautiful and tranquil. We enjoyed the visit.
definitely a must for its beauty!!!,"i was born and raised in korea, but never really thought about visiting touristy places until my friends came to visit... most were just boring or just similar to a lot of the places i went to as a child on school trips, but bongeunsa -- this place is a must. i went three times in the last four months taking different friends there, and it was a new experience every time. they have different themes -- for example, there were white lanterns in every corner of the temple when i first visited and the second time there were beautiful Chrysanthemums everywhere to celebrate fall. if you're staying in seoul, bongeunsa is very very easy to get to on the subway and i highly recommend taking the time out to see it!"
Must visit in Seoul,"It was my favorite stop and a true sanctuary in Seoul. I didn’t know what to expect when we walked up to Bongeunsa Temple but a calm came over me about thirty seconds in. It was around 5:30pm and we were just in time for the evening prayer.Bongeunsa Temple is a beautiful 1200 year old buddhist temple nestled in the midst of a concrete jungle, located a bit far from the typical tourist sites, right in front of the Intercontinental Coex hotel."
Calming retreat in the middle of the hustle and bustle,"It's ironic that COEX, one of the absolute symbols of capitalism, consumer culture and gambling is across the street. But perhaps it's also fitting in that if offers a quite, calming and peaceful juxtaposition to the ordered chaos of Seoul. Go without expectations, comfortable shoes to roam and walk up and down the grounds and stairs and a please, please, please turn off your cell phone. "
Fantastic Buddha temple still in use,"Loved the place, free entrance and quite a number of spots for making photos, really nice place to visit. Just take care not to bother the people praying, as the rooms are still in use :-)It's possible to get a tour on the entrance."
Quiet place in the heart of Seoul,"I just love this place, a short walk for this gardens connect you with the heart of Korea. Peaceful, powerful and beauty."
Peace In The Middle of the City!,"What a beautiful, peaceful place. And a great chance to glimpse the real life of the holy people who call it home"
Another world opposite COEX,"this is sexond time i come here . I can feel piece and quiet . Its another world from COEX world . You can walk around temple , beautiful big buddha here or can see city view from top of this temple. "
Favorite place to visit in Seoul,This is a special place. Like a land that time forgot. I often tell folks who are just passing through Seoul to make this the one thing they go see because it's just unique to find this place of zen in the middle of this bustling city.
Where you find calmness,"Walking from both 2 nearby MRTs to the temple is not closed at all. Line 2 station will need to cross COEX mall whereas Line 7 will need to climb up & down a hill). But once you reach to the temple's door, all tiredness will disappear. Local people buy rice, red beans, candle & flowers to bring in the temple. If you're tourists, just quietly pay a visit inside the main temple & surrounding. Spring & Fall are 2 best seasons to visit. Look at the lanterns hanging up on the ceiling, pretty nice ones."
Excellent,"One of the very few tourist site south of the Hangang river. A real jewel. Not only a temple but many temples, pagodas. Lovely walk through the park, very nice garden."
great views,Another stunning temple in Seoul with beautiful grounds and great views of the city. Nice Buddha statue as well.
Active temple,"My husband and I happened to be staying across the street from this temple, so it was at the top of our to do list for today. We are so glad this was our introduction to Seoul! Although it's in a busy part of the city, you'd never know it from the inside of the grounds. It's free, and it's an active Buddhist Temple, so you get to see and hear how they worship. We thought it was very interesting, and well worth the visit! "
Surreal...,The temple itself is so big! The shrine is really colorful and they have this huge sculpture of Buddha in the back. You can actually feel that solemnity whenever you step inside the temple. They also have this souvenir shop in the entrance where you can buy different charms and books. 
I don't live far away ,Well worth a visit if in the area. It's a local visit for me and i love temples and go regularly. Fantastic in summer. Go for it!!!
Must visit to explore Korean culture ,"If you are in Seoul, then don't miss this. You would get a very good glimpse of Korean history and ancient architecture! Also this is at the downtown, so don't miss the hot stream which is walkable from this place. It's reachable via Seoul metro! "
"Beautiful temple, next to COEX",I visited the temple primarily because it was opposite the COEX where I was attending an event. Due to its location being surrounded by lots of modern offices etc. I was expecting much but it was very enjoyable. The gardens were nice to walk around and some of the construction of the buildings appeared very old which was interesting to look at.
"Very interesting, active Buddhist Temple","This Buddhist Temple was right across the street from my hotel. There was no charge to enter the temple grounds, but there was box from donations and a gift shop. It is an active temple with services run on a regular basis during the day. It had a several interesting buildings and a brochure for a self guided tour. I was careful to be respectful of the worshipers and the holy buildings during my visit. It was very impressive and I would recommend it if one is staying in the area."
Two worlds,"Lived in Seoul for three years and this temple is my favorites of all in the city. Right across from the COEX mall, you can see the two worlds co-existing in harmony. Free to all but donations are greatly appreciated. Please show respect when on the temple ground. Dress properly and remove all footwear when entering prayer rooms. "
Well preserved temple,Located around coex mall. A traditional landmark in seoul district! Not very big temple but is well maintain (:
Beautiful spot,"All constructions are very nice and beautiful. It seems that the garden is also nice. However, given that our visit was on 1st of January, we could not see the most of this garden. It is better to come here from mid spring till the mid autumn."
Beautiful temple,"Very nice temple. People were friendly. There was no cost. Not a big deal, but a great way to spend an your walking around. some of the areas are not open to the public. Huge Buddha statue that is great for pictures. Excellent gift shops. Definitely worth seeing. Right across from the COEX (mall, movie theater, restaurants, etc) and Casino so lots to do around the area. "
Reflective,We enjoyed the temple on a Saturday afternoon just at prayers. Wonderful to see and experience. One of my favourite things to do in Seoul
peaceful and worth the visit,"Bongeunsa is the head temple for Seon Buddhism in Seoul. It is a very peaceful place, surrounded by the skyscrapers and busy streets of Seoul. Would definitely recommend a visit on a sunny and calm day, and spend time walking around the grounds."
History among technology,Amazing beauty surrounded by modern buildings and technology. Very nice temple with abundance of history
Serene,"The Temple and the grounds are beautiful and give a instant calming effect. There are many buildings to see so give yourself plenty of time. Once inside, it's incredibly quiet even though there is a very busy street and traffic outside. Make sure you look all around. There is beauty everywhere. Please be mindful while touring the grounds of the people in prayer inside of the different buildings. If going the the COEX mall, try to visit this Temple. It's nicely tucked away off the street and worth a visit. You'll be glad you did. There are a couple of gift shops as well."
Tranquil ,Very interesting temple with many buildings to look at. There's even a home stay right on top of hill. Very big Buddha statue & a smaller Goddess of Mercy near the car park. 
Historical sight seeing,Great place to visit but please bear in mind that it is a place of prayers so please respect the place
Beautiful working temple,Visited in winter. Great to see a working to temple. Came with a cranky toddler so couldn't stay as long as we would have liked but great peaceful place. Cafe nice for a stop.
A must! ,"Beautiful Buddhist temple in the heart of Seoul, surrounded by skyscrapers but still a relaxing place. Entrance is free and it really worths the visit. "
Stunning religious sight in Gangnam,"DATE VISITED: November 15, 2014PROS: Astounding place, beautiful sight, a bit peaceful (if you want some break from busy Seoul). Huge place!CONS: Nothing much, just put this sight on your list of places while in Seoul and you won't regret it.LOCATION: 5/5PRICE: 5/5HOSPITALITY: 4/5ATTRACTIONS: 4/5"
Big 'Lung of Seoul' in CBD. ,"It is near by COEX aquarium at Samseong subway station. It is ver big enough regarded as Lung os Seoul' which provide quite park space for those who are tired. It is very close to CBM (central business district of Samseong: Trade Tower, COEX). Monk Exam had been held here. Belong to Jogye sect and produced famous monk eg. Bowoo. "
A Piece of Heaven in a Busy City,"It's a benefit for those attending conferences at Coex to have this beautiful, 8th century temple nearby. Given conventions are intense affairs, even with Coex being a great facility, this is a gift--a way for people not only to get fresh air, but also a taste of (non touristy) Korean culture that's authentic and used by ""real people."" There's also a nice shop outside the front gate and many little tucked away sanctuaries."
Easy access cultural visit,This temple is exactly opposite the COEX and is very easy to visit. There's no fees so you can spend your time in this tranquil location. We came at a time when there was a kimchi making event which was pure bonus.
Paradise,This temple is located in front of the Intercontinental Coex hotel and is a oasis of peace and beauty. I went there everyday even when I worked long hours. The shop sells beautiful collections of teas. Inside this temple there is the National Meditation Centre and there are opportunities for retreats and tasters. I did the two hours taster - mediation and tea ceremony. It was lovely. 
Must visit!,"Firstly I was blown away to find a beautiful 1200 year old temple nestled in the midst of a concrete jungle ! I love this temple more than Jogyesa as I found it more soothing to my soul hearing the monks chanting, the many small temples in the same grounds allows you some quiet and solitude if you just want to sit still and absorb the vibrations of the place. Definitely a place to visit and don't forget to do lunch at their hall where they serve everyone..rich,poor.destitute for KRW 1000. Simple food but i found it satisfying"
Tranquil and relaxing,Was attending a congress at the COEX and popped across the road to this temple one afternoon. Lovely buildings and gardens. Very relaxing and tranquil couple of hours. Pleased I popped in on the spur of a moment. Left with a peaceful feeling.
Large Temple Near Coex Center,"This is a Buddhist temple near the Coex Center. The entrance and the buildings are beautiful, but it's a rather quick walk to see everything. Go into one of the temples. They are beautiful and very peaceful."
Simply beautiful,"At the entrance you find a small stream and a pathway going up towards a temple. As you walk up the pathway, religious art starts to appear and soon you can here sounds and Buddhist chants coming from the temple. Little after you're basically at the edge of a forest, you can still hear the dim noise of the roads but it only adds to your feeling of surprise and relax.It's a gem. It will make your day alone."
A very ancient Buddhist temple in the Gangdam city centre,This is a very beautiful ancient Buddhist temple in the middle of Gangdam city centre. It was located directly across the street from the Coex Mall. The roof and the whole building is so beautiful. The Buddha image is on standing posture and is very unique with a hat shelter over the Buddha head .There is a huge ancient dome bell in the temple compound.
peaceful,"located in a nice park, those few temples are beautiful and well restored. A few beautiful warriors statues welcome you at the front gate, and an impressive Buddha statue takes center stage further, with religious people praying here and there, some chanting inside other building, the ringing bells gave a very spiritual atmosphere to the place"
Very dark in the evening,"I took a chance to visit the place in the evening, after all the palaces and shops have closed. However, it was too dark to see anything. At least from outside. It is far from everything, except if you stay nearby. A bit dissapointing."
Absolutely stunning ,"Free entry, so authentic. We were the only tourists there, everyone else seemed to be there to pray. We didn't get a chance to see a service as one of the people praying shooed us out of one of the temples when they saw that we were just tourists taking photos, but in a way I liked that. It showed how 'real' the temple was, not something special that has deteriorated into a predominantly a tourist attraction. Best temple in town. Right next door to Bongeusa subway on line 9. Be respectful and discreet with your cameras. Bear in mind that first and foremost you are in a place of worship "
Bongeun Temple,"In the busiest city center of Gangnam (the Sothern Side of the Han River in Seoul), there is a temple which is very quiet. You can walk slowly along a path in the temple. "
Serenity at its Best,One of those temples you shouldn't miss when in Seoul . Best time to go when on regular days you enjoy peace and quiet and not many tourists. The structures awesome and the garden so beautiful . .you can commune with nature itself. 
Amazing,More than 1000 years old temple. Just walking distance from Intercontinental Coex Seoul hotel. Very peaceful with great yellow flower garden at the entrance. 
Nice Buddist temple !,"Well, if you love temples, and you are Bhuddist, it is worth a visit as you will like to environment in the temple and you can join the pray as well in the morning. There is a hugh standing Buddha statue outdoor inside the temple which is beautiful. The design of Buddist temples in Korea is all the same but this giant stone Budhha is definitely different !"
Beautiful and worth the visit,"The big steps and Red doors to greet you area spectacular, The multiple prayer temples and surrounding grounds are an amazing sight. This was worth the trip to see a historic sight in korea. "
A temple surrounded by high-rise buildings,"This temple in Gangnam-gu, Seoul, is a complex of several buildings and shrines on a hillside which can be explored in any order. It is free to get in and a very peaceful place to visit. It goes without saying that tourists, though they are welcome, are not actually allowed into the temples where worshippers are constantly praying. The interior can be observed from the outside. It is close to a subway station."
Beautiful in the city,Take a break from the markets and shopping for some peaceful reflection at this wonderful temple across from the coex mall. By far the fewest people we encountered gave us the opportunity to truly absorb the spirit of the place. Lots of different structures built on a hill with very good english signage made for a great afternoon.
Bongeunsa Temple,Bongeunsa Temple is amazing. It is so beautiful. You can walk all around and really feel at peace in the entire Temple.
A restful place amongst the noise,"A great place to visit. A guided tour, followed by a tea ceremony, and then making a paper water Lilly and then finally a meditation session. A great experience."
Beautiful Temple in the Heart of Gangnam,"This Temple is quite well hidden from the surrounding hustle and bustle of Gangnam. You could blink and quite easily miss it. When you enter the temple grounds, it's quite surprising how large the temple actually is. The temple is beautifully preserved, it has a number of pagodas, and one of the largest statues of Buddha at the foot of the top hill. Looking down from the statue, you get to enjoy a difference perspective of Gangnam. The temple is also part of the Temple stay program that is popular with foreigners and highly recommended for those seeking something different and alternative to the buzz of Seoul."
Beautiful buddhist temple,"This beautiful buddhist temple is 1200 years old. It is like a little park with many buildings to visit. There is a very impressive 23 meter tall Buddha. It is still a very active religious site, with monks chanting and praying, people meditating etc. As a tourist you have to respect the religious activities that take place all around you. Entrance is free, and I really enjoyed the experience."
Downtown temple,"A traditional temple in Seoul, which is well worth the visit if you have a few hours in the afternoon to spare."
Impressive Architecture,Beautiful temple situated just next to the COEX Hotel / Shopping Complex. Free to visit. Many different areas to wander around. Has various ceremonies at different times.
Wow just heaven,Wow heaven you can stay at this temple if you want to do a retreat . The day we went it was full of people praying and they had a full on service with singing and it was wonderful to see so spiritual . the temple is huge and has quite a lot of different parts to it . There is a big white statue outside on the hill which is huge and it is so peaceful to walk around and there is a huge bell which is in a preserved casing you can look at . The white lantern on the roof make a big flash of colour as well as the red ones in the temple itself . We just walked in off the street no entrance fee like some charge
"Amazing 1,200+ Years Ago","This was the inviting view (and the source of the alluring early morning sound from a Bell Pavilion) across the boulevard from our InterContinental COEX hotel and we explored around the many buildings which were in use for Buddhist prayer and meditation, the immaculate grounds, and the absolute serenity of the hilltop location of the Gwanseum-bosal statue. "
Hidden treasure ,This temple is absolutely beautiful. You wouldn't guess it's as big as it really is by looking at it from the street. Definitely worth the trip. It's very different from temples in other Asian countries. 
A serene stop in Gangnam,"Bongeunsa is a Buddhist temple located in Samseong-dong, Gangnam-gu. It is located on the slope of Sudo Mountain, across the street from the COEX Mall.it was a great stop during exploration of Gangnam. Subway-Line 2 Samseong Stn. 100 m towards ASEM Tower from Exit 6 or Line 7 Cheongdam Stn. 150 m towards Kyunggi High School from Exit 2"
"Peaceful, so make sure you come in peace!","I'm not very experienced with buddhist temples, so I exercised a lot of caution here. It's a large, quiet temple complex which attracts many practicing buddhists who come here to pray - so keep your distance, they didn't become buddhists in order to be tourist attractions. Just go along, enjoy the atmosphere and quiet, take photos from a respectful position (i.e., not right up in someone's face) and relax. It's really very lovely. Don't miss out on the huge Buddha in the section left of the main entrance, too."
Calm Buddhist Temple,"The largest Buddhist Temple in Seoul. Calm, serene, Has a nice tea house serving green tea. Tried not to disturb people praying inside. Be sure to visit Jogyesa Temple which is located in the center of the city."
A must see,"This temple has so much to offer to the tourist-- beautiful buildings and grounds, a changing of the guards ceremony and several museums around the edge."
Serene Temple in the City,"A serene temple iin Seoul, the Bogeunsa Temple offered me an insight into a Buddhist Temple in Seoul. I feel that the temple has more of a ""Zen"" feel compared to most Chinese Buddhist Temples, it also has several huge statues behind the temple ground. Just outside the temple grounds, there is a relatively decent Vegetarian restaurant and shop, where the dishes are tasty and economically priced. "
Tranquility in the City,"In and among the skyscrapers is this temple of tranquility. There are rooms where you can go and meditate or just sit peacefully.I saw many workers sitting in the gardens during their lunch time, which is what i would have done, if I lived and worked there.They offer an over night stay for a fee or an afternoon of meditation and lantern making (again, for a fee)."
Beautiful temple,It's the temple across the Coex mall which is really convenient. It's very beautiful inside starting from the doorways to the golden Buddhas . If you want to go inside the temples you need to take off your shoes and have to wear socks- you can't be barefooted. They have English tours on Thursdays and offer temple stays too .
very peaceful indeed,"Calm and serene place in heart of the city, rather s walk from the business center. The temple is very pretty and spread around in a big area. I went there in the evening and enjoyed walking around in the temple and seeing the evening rituals."
"Stunning, serene, evocative.","Pronounced 'Bong uun sa' this temple complex lies on the south side of the river dividing Seoul and is almost a hidden oasis of peace threatening at any time to be swallowed up by the tall techno-scrapers surrounding it on all sides. even the 70-ft high standing Buddha statue is hidden from city view. This complex is home to the Korean style of Buddhism and has been here for over a thousand years.Walking through the main gate you are greeted by carefully crafted tree and shrub arrangements with streams, and the first temple is in front of you. There are twelve others, and when I was there, a religious ceremony was taking place. No wonder so many people were praying for peace - the North Korean ultimatum ha just 2 more hours to run before it expired.On an upward slope with the statue of Buddha crowning the site, this complex simply radiates serenity, peace and calm. My photographs do it little justice. The complex has a supernatural capacity to shut out the noise of Seoul City, so that the visitor at once feels calm and rested as you walk through the glades and around the variously sized temples.This really is a 'must see, must experience'. It is tricky to get to from Downtown, as you need to change on the south side of the river. But it is definitely worth it, far more than the more tourist-packed temple near the Downtown area of the northern half of Seoul."
Ancient temple that's worth a visit,"This temple was built in 794. Beautiful structure and peaceful environment. Exit next to Coex Atlantic Hall, walk 50m to Coex Intercontinental Seoul. Cross the zebra crossing in front of the hotel."
A great stop in Gangnam,"We stumbled upon this temple by accident but were so glad we did. We ended up getting there during prayer time and it was a moving experience. Beautiful grounds, interesting history and a great cultural experience. The temple is near other attractions (e.g. CoEx) and would make a great stop during exploration of Gangnam."
Great place to relax,"Chanting, many people, in city center, nice view, also a big buddha there. Great place to take pictures."
quiet oasis in Seoul,"Whilst attending a convention at Coex, I could look out at this temple. It looked so serene that I escaped the conference for 40 minutes to visit it. Amazingly a quiet oasis right beside a busy 8 lane major road. Just walking around this temple, which is still being used, was a delight. Calm and serene you could understand why people still prayed there. Lovely buildings to view and wander the grounds peacefully."
Perfect,Loved the tea room. The tea ceremony was taught to us by a very gentle monk and payment is donaton only. The contrast to the city is dramatic in mood and archetecture. It is a working temple. 
Great site to visit,This was a great site to visit -- We really enjoyed area and visiting - I would have like more description in English to fully enjoy however was beautiful site
Peace and solitude.,This is a very serene and peaceful place just a short walk from the bustling city. Seeing the locals pay homage to the Buddhist shrines is inspiring. Well worth a visit. 
Fancy temple,Big buddha status is there to pray. Temple stay is available with reservation. Shopping mall and airport terminal is close by.
Temple life,I went to Bongeunsa with a bunch of my mates from academy and we did the Temple Life program. First a guide took us around the temple grounds and explained things to us. Then we had really nice tea and talk with one of the monks. We also did paper lotus flower and meditating. It was really relaxing and i felt really at peace after. The stress was gone.
Temple in Gangnam,"This temple nest with in Gangnam district, real nice, one of the very few temple in Seoul. Temples are not within Seoul."
A must....,"if you love temple and pagodas you're on the right placeGreat place, an island of silence, a must in Seoul"
Soothing Atmosphere,It is free to visit on top of everything. you are free to take pictures and enter the prayers rooms but should keep silent and be careful not to offend the people who are meditating there. a big and beautiful statue of budha is shining on top of a series of temples. you can also have walk inside woods. they offer a stay pachage for those who would like to experience living with monks and grt to know about Buddhism.  
Working Temple,"The historical sites in Seoul can have a repetitive feel to them, as the architecture from the Jeosun period all looks very much the same. This one is really worth seeing for itself, however. It is a working temple, and if you come at the right time (Sunday morning for me), you can see (and participate in) various religious services or simply stand back and observe people coming to venerate the giant Buddha at the top of the hill. "
Nice if you like temples,Im not a big fan of these sites but it was interesting to see. Lots of tourists..........keep your elbows up.
Relaxing place,Just infant of the COEX centre. One of the most important religious places in Seoul. Free access to the temple.
Awesome get away,If you want to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city come here to check out the peaceful traditional Korean houses- ☺☺ you don't have to pay it's free
It's not touristic !,"I've heard about ""temple stay"" and about this temple but just during visiting it i know what it's mean . Go there and enjoy , if you are looking for some special !"
Serene religious experience,Better than the ABC's of touring - another bloody castle. Quiet prayer and beautiful grounds are a nice break for people of any religion.
Great Temple Life Program,"I had the opportunity to do the Temple Life program at Bongenunsa Temple (wish I had more time to do the Temple Stay.) It was an awesome experience - tour of the temple, learning to meditate, made lotus lanterns and had tea ceremony with a Buddhist Nun. Before the program I walked around the Temple on my own for hours and saw the beautiful lanterns on display for the upcoming Lotus Lantern Festival. It was a peaceful, calm area in the middle of Seoul"
Gorgeous temple with serene atmosphere,"We visited during a heavy rainstorm, and so didn't linger as long as I would have liked, but even in the downpour we could tell that this temple was extraordinarily beautiful and serene - despite being in the center of the city. We loved the paper lanterns, colorful painted details, and giant Buddha statue. Priests were chanting and holding ceremonies in several of the buildings we passed, which made it even more interesting and atmospheric. Even though this temple is popular with visitors, it is very much a working temple, and most people we saw were there to pray."
Beautiful temple,"It's amazing that such a haven of tranquility could have emerged in one of the most bustling districts of Seoul. Bongeunsa is something special, and it's very convenient if you don't have time to go further out of the city to visit a temple."
Favorite temple in Korea,"It's easy to grab lunch at Coex and then head over to this lovely temple. It really has it all, beautiful nature, a giant statue of Buddha, lovely architecture, the works. Definitely make a stop here."
Make sure to have some tea!,"This was my first tourist stop in Korea and I really liked it.We wandered around the various prayer rooms, many of which were in use, and entered a few to sit down and take in the atmosphere.The buildings are lovely and when we were there (July) they were putting up lots of lantterns, which made a nice sight.There is a little tea room - be sure to go into it. The lovely lady there took us through making tea *properly* and it was a delightful experienceDefinitely worth visiting!"
WONDERFUL TEMPLE....MUST GO !,it is such a beautiful place and right in front of Coex Mall...so have a walk in this beautiful place full of lanterns and stairs till you come down to see the huge budda and when you finish you can cross the street and get into a most modern mall of Seoul to have a lunch or dinner if you visit the temple on the evening.... must go . so beautiful.
Uplifting,Be prepared to tap into your spiritual side. This temple is well maintained and is part of a program called TempleStay. You can opt to stay and participate in the religious routine by selecting a program that fits your schedule. Views are spectacular. In walking distance from Coex Mall.
Beautiful & peaceful temple.,"Directly opposite COEX, this is a beautiful and peaceful temple. Visited this temple on both my visits. Highly recommend it to all visitors. "
peace among the hectic,Huge temple complex with many separate buildings just opposite the COEX building. A taste of old and quiet Korean life in a hectic traffic jam and business district.
Greatness,The history and culture of the place was so great and enjoyable. The people were friendly but English language for guiding tourists was not enough.
Definitely worth visiting,"The temple itself is full of many places to see. The different halls, the Buddha statues and the colorful lanterns make this site a truly religious and sacred place. We happened to visit at prayer time and it was interesting to observe the rituals and prayers."
Bomgenunsa Temple,Its a very big temple complex and well worth a visit and probably more gnd settingand than the other big one in central Seoul.. Nice place to visit and take lots of photos. Also very relaxing grounds to wander around
Lovely Temple in the middle of Gangnam,Directly opposite the Coex and creates a lovely calm atmosphere for a lunchbreak after a hectic day. 
Beauty in the city,"Going to Bongeunsa was odd as took a tour through Gangnam. Lots of traffic. Temple was closed for a ceremony, but our tour guide managed to get us in. Once inside, you can see why it's a popular place to visit. Beautiful grounds and so peaceful. Strange to believe with all the traffic on the other side of the fence. A flying visit, but well worth it. "
Have tea at a temple,This is a beautiful temple in Seoul and easy to get to by metro. Our highlight was having traditional tea in the temple. There is no fee but if you would like to give a donation you can. The hostess was very nice and spoke english and explained the process of traditionally serving tea.
Buddhist temples,This area is a wonderful meditative site in the midst of the noise & pollution of city centre. Some temples over 1200 years old. Should be a must visit.
Peace in the city,"After spending time in both Japan and Korea, I can really say this was my favorite temple. Perhaps, my trip was enhanced by the fact that they were celebrating with lanterns everywhere. Each of the various rooms around the large temple had prayer sessions going on with relaxing rhythmic chanting. The lanterns lit at night with the backdrop of the city skyline was wonderful! Also the staff were walking around offering to take pictures. It was a wonderful, calming experience! I would recommend going in the evening!"
Beautiful and quiet,"Very nice! Guided tours, with munk and tea is possible. It was a wonderful place, vivant and pulsating as it is used by the local population."
"A ""Must Visit"" for Buddhists!","Went for praying with my wife while on holiday. Very grand temple that is very well maintained and kept its architecture that spanned centuries ago. It is very clean, and there is a magnificient Buddha statue facing the modern, highly developed Seoul Metropolis. Buddhist books on sale but all in Korean though.Highly recommended for Buddhist tourists visiting Seoul."
Just beautiful,"Right beside the temple to excess that is the Coex Mall, sits this haven of tranquility. We loved the paper sculptures - really beautiful."
Lovely temple from 794 C.E.,"My family stayed at the Intercontinental Coex and while we explored much of Seoul we liked finding places close by too and the Bongeunsa Temple was almost right across the street.The area covered by this temple is very large with several different buildings. There is a parking lot too but there are beautiful gates, statues, multiple halls, and a pavilion. The most impressive thing, I felt, was the Great Statue of Maitreya Buddha. It had some cool carvings in the side of demon type men creatures and is 23 meters tall. Many of the halls had little paper lanterns hanging from the ceilings, hundreds of them which we found interesting.There are a fair amount of stairs and climbing here, so be aware of that. It is sort of built on the side of a hill so there are elevation differences as you move around the temple site.The place offers opportunities to experience Buddhist practices with overnight stays and 2 hour tours, with associated fees. We did not participate in these. The 2 hour tour takes place every Thursday and includes a tea ceremony which I am told you can still watch even if you aren't part of the tour. The place is clean, serene, and lovely. There is a lot of greenery as your walk between the buildings and has a sense of being in nature, even though it is in the middle of the Gangnam district. It is a nice place to take a break and see some traditional Buddhist buildings and customs."
Excellent Buddhist temple,Delight to visit after sun set when all the displays are lighted and the lanterns glow... Its a fairly big temple so do set aside 30-45 minutes to get a complete view of the temple
Nice Buddhist Temple near COEX area in Seoul!,Very nice Buddhist Temple in the COEX area in Seoul! A moment to medidate in a green authentic space situated between modern buildings and skyscrapers.
Beautiful and Inspiring,I liked the fact that the temple is located in such a place that you can always easily visit and relax in a middle of a work day. Beautiful scenery in the middle of the city famous business center. 
best description would be peaceful,Many women went up to this temple during the middle of the day. It was interesting to watch them meditate and gather. Not very many men . This particular one did not smell like incense to us. It is right across the Coex mall. The Buddha in the back is very tall but not the most astounding one I have seen In Asia. It was part of our Gangnam tour but I would not pay to go in for $30 per person.
Temple in the mid of the city,"The temple was fabulous where you can practice meditation. They also have a ""temple stay"" program where you can rejuvenate your soul and mind."
lovely Temple,"We enjoyed this peaceful temple, If want the best experience try (temple life), It will take around 2 hrs and cost you 30 $. before you leave try lovely Green Tea in Korean Way for free but you have to donate and put the money you want in small box"
Amazing scenery,"Despite being a tourist place, it is very peaceful here. The scenery is moving and beautiful. The best time to come here is during autumn and spring. Very colorful nature art, amazing chery blossom. Simply love it."
Buddha birthday lanterns,"Best time to go is close to Buddhas birthday because there are many colorful, pretty lanterns all over."
"Poorly Lighted, Best on Daytime","Went there during the night time at around 8pm after a whole day downtown. The lantern and light decorations were beautiful. But the main reason to being there is also to visit a very old temple. During the night time the pathways were poorly lighted up and the temple, surrounding areas, statues were poorly lighted up. You will need a very good camera with good flash to capture it. Best visited during the daytime. If you planned to visit early in the morning; they are already open from 3am! And by 5am, Seoul would have been quite bright during summer time."
More Interesting Than Most,"We had a guide with us so had the advantage of getting a description and a bit of history of what we were seeing. The Temple grounds were larger than some of the other temples we had seen, and there were a number of interesting buildings. It was worth inclusion in a tour."
Exploring Bonguensa Temple,"It is a 1200year old temple built in 794 C.E. during the reign of King Wonseong. Today it is the center of Buddhist practice where monks apply themselves to chanting, monastic meals, communal work and Seon meditation. Explore the 12 views , starting with Jinyeo-mun, Gate of Suchness, things just as they are. From this gate, your trip to the ultimate truth begins. To the left and right are the 4 celestial Kings., constructed from wood. Up ahead is the Beopwang-ru, Dharma King Pavilion which faces the Main Buddha Hall., Daewoong-jeon.. There are also other praying halls and at the time we visited chantings and prayings were being carried out at these halls. You could feel the qi. There is a 23m high Statue of Maitreya Buddha , the future Buddha who vows to save sentient beings in the era after the lifetime of Sakyamuni Buddha.. Up next is the statue of Haesu Gwaneum-sang, Bodhisattva of Compassion in the pond., behind the Bell Pavilion. Inside the pavilion are 4 instruments- a Dharma Bell, a Dharma drum, a gong and a wooden fish. These 4 instruments are struck just before services at dawn and in the evening, with the intention of saving all beings in the universe. To get here, we took Line 2 and alighted at Samseong station, exit 6 and walk straight ahead for 10 minutes."
one of the top ten places to visit in seoul,A beautiful refuge from the bustle of the city. The big standing buddha and the surrounding buildings make a very picturesque visit. We were there in May and it is the month os Buddha's birthday. The lantern festival makes very good picture opportunities
Beautiful Landmark,"According to the brochure, this monument is 1200 years old. Not a Buddhist, but interesting history."
A Nice Break From Other Sightseeing or Shopping,"This is a busy temple in the middle of the city, just opposite the Coex Korean Trade Center. I have been here a couple of times and it is a nice break from other sightseeing or shopping. There is a monumental statue of Kwan Yin facing which is a nice sheltered area where you can sit an meditate or just rest and contemplate. There are often other events happening. It is lovely to view the juxtaposition of ancient and modern in the skylines of the temple and surrounding post-modern buildings. "
Beautiful Temple in the city,"This is such a beautiful Buddhist temple. My wife and I visited just at the beginning of spring and it was really awesome. It is just across the street from the Coex Mall (near the exit by Gap I think) and right close to PF Changs. It is totally worth the trip out if you have spare time. For business travelers staying around Coex, this should definitely be a place to not miss since it is so close. "
"Breathe, Relax, Reflect","Even if you're not a Buddhist (I am not) this is worth a visit. A beautiful park right inside downtown Seoul, it provides a relief to the hustle and bustle of the work at hand. I stayed in the hotel right next to the temple (COEX Interncontinental) and didn't mind being woken at 4am each morning when the bell was gonged. The ceremonial bell ringing occurs at 4am and at around dusk (6pm when I was there) and I happened upon it by accident, and ended up staying for approximately 30 minutes to watch the proceedings. Fun, interesting, refreshing.This is a must-visit in April since the flowers are absolutely gorgeous."
Oasis in the middle of Gangnam,"I never thought I could find such a quiet and serene atmosphere right in the middle of upscale Gangnam. The monastery is beautiful, well-kept, clean. Overall there is a very positive vibe, the nuns are very nice. We talked to one and she said they pray all day for re-unification of Korea. Better than expected experience."
peaceful and lovely,"I'd spent a few days wearing myself out at a conference and shopping binge before I fonud this place and it was just the thing I needed. I didn't book a tour, just went in and walked around. It didn't cost anything. I sat and meditated in the hall (shoes off) for a while with some other ladies and scored some traditional Korean cake that tasted very buddhist, ie. of nothing! Still, it was a really touching thing to be given something by a stranger in that quiet friendly space. Up behind the main hall is a series of dirt paths through a small grove of trees. It's pretty and feels like you are out of the city even if you can still hear it. The gardens closer to the temples are lovely and still under construction. When I was there it was spring and the cherry blossom had just fallen and was carpeting sections of the temple like snow.It is literally just outside and across the road from the COEX centre, so if you're there on work I recommend taking the time to stroll over to this restorative place."
family vacation,Nice place to go to see Korean history. It was a good place for my 10 year to visit since he has a fascination with history. He had a very enjoyable time and of course us also.
Serene place amidst the bustle of Seoul,"What a place! A big and ancient buddhist temple in the middle of the busy Gangnam district. Right across the street from the COEX convention center. It's alive as well. All day long tourists are outnumbered by worshippers. I made an offering for a friend via the office. You can write a card and someone will hang it under a lampoon in the great hall 200.000 won for a year. It made me happy.`oh, don't forget to visit the tea bar in front next to the buddhist souvenir shop."
Nice Temple,Peaceful to walk around and not so crowded.Nice architecture and sculptures. Nice Gardens and cherry blossom.
Peaceful Temple in the city,"A calm temple in the center of the Gangnam. It was amazing to feel such tranquility in the center of the city. I practice yoga often, so it was quite an experience to visit such a special place and watch people take time to meditate in their day. Beautiful gardens, a must see."
Unexpected surprise opposite my hotel,"I arrived at my hotel, Intercontinental COEX after dark and was ushered to my corner suite. In the morning I opened my curtains to be greeted with a birds eye view on the Bongeunsa Temple and immediately resolved to visit it after my meetings. It was a great decision. At this time of year (late April) the Azaleas are in full flower and compliment the wonderful temple buildings. This is a real gem in the middle of a bustling city. Buddhist worshippers inside the temples were in deep meditation with the monks chanting and drumming together with the wind chimes clanging. The ambiance was restful and everyone smiled at you.What a great unexpected surprise for a weary business traveller. "
One Of My Favorite Temples in Seoul,"I actually visited here in April of 2014 (but it's not letting me select back that far). It's located in Gangnam, across from the Coex mall. It's a lovely escape from the bustling city right outside it's temple walls. It's a beautiful temple, definitely worth a visit. There's also a gift shop in the front with a lot of buddhist type gifts. If visiting temples is your thing, check this one out."
Nice Temple,"Very big and beautiful. It is very active very touristy also. Set it the middle of the city it provides beautiful pictures, but you won't get much of a traditional feel as everything looks new and well-kept. Not a quiet place for contemplation."
Beautiful,My husband and I visited and we were amazed by the beauty and serenity of it all. beautiful detailed artwork.
Interesting rebuilt temple,Staff at the entrance helpful and provided a guide written in English. Lots of information boards too inside and nice to explore if you have half an hour to spare 
One of the places I liked in Seoul,"I love that there is this zen spot among all the tall buildings in the area. Very relaxing! I am glad that they opened the temple for temple stay, wish we had more time to stay. The people in the information counter are helpful and informative. There are candles, incense, and rice if you want to make an offering. There is a nice, huge drum with a dragon head in one of the structures. They have a stream going down towards the main gate, beautiful! Worth the trip!!!!!! Go and visit.  "
Very good place to relax,"C1 ( 2015.04.01 ) I visited there because my appointment with my friend delayed near Bongeunsa, So I went in temple and enjoy having time to spare. This temple was located near downtown Seoul. By contrast, general Buddism temple was located in the mountains. This temple's atmosphere was very calm and reverent. I liked Buddism temple's atmosphere, view, scent. There was big statue of the Buddha, and some Korean traditional temple structures. Not big temple, but beautiful place."
Worth the journey,"Bongeunsa is a little out of the way if you are visiting central Seoul, but if you are in Gangnam, this is well worth the visit. The temple has some relics, a manicured grounds, amazing structures and even a shamanistic shrine. It stands out from the otherwise modern setting. Worth a trip."
1200 year old temple,"It is a Korean Buddhism Temple situated in front of Coex, a huge shopping center and Intercontinental Hotel."
Calm and beautiful,"Beautiful image of Buddha in Korean style, many Korean people went there to pray and pay respect to. Decoration and architecture are similar to palaces."
A peaceful temple. Worth visiting if you are into temples and Buddhism,"The temple was easy to find. On our way there, we walked on the main road in the freezing cold weather. A better way to get to the temple is to cut across Coex Mall which we did on our return. In that way, you will be protected from the cold if you are travelling in winter. Upon reaching the temple, we were greeted by a few nice ladies and they gave us some papers to write our wishes on and after that we folded them on the strings in front of the temple. When we visited, part of the temple was under renovation but we are free to roam around. We walked around the temple and took some pictures, it was peaceful and quiet there. A good escape from the busy city in Seoul. Before we left the temple, we were given a packet of rice cake by the temple attendants for good luck. It was a huge packet and each of us had a bite. Overall, a pleasant experience for our family."
Worth the detour to visit,"I visited this location just after checking out to COEX mall and it is fantastic! It is preserved amazingly and it is still being used as an active temple, so you will see people going to pray. There was also a cherry blossom tree there, first one ive seen all week in Seoul so far. You can also purchase some souvenirs at the shop, they are reasonably priced."
"""Are you a Buddhist?","""Are you a Buddhist?"" , the girl at the information counter asked seeing I was wearing beads that were given by a Chinese friend. Finally, I had the chance of visiting this Buddhist temple across the Coex Interrcon. Long before this part of Seoul was developed before Seoul hosted the 1988 Olympics, this temple stood to provide a place for meditation. Now, it appears to be an anomaly in the husle and bustle of Gangnam. A great place to escape the city... Chanting monks, age- old painting and structures, a bell.. a temple stay is available too."
Tranquility at Bongeunsa,"Its a place were you can stay in peace and relaxing, in the middle of a big city like Seoul. Beautiful place, visitors can learn about meditation and buddhism."
A candle in the wind,"I visit this temple every time I am in seoul. First time I barely found it after getting lost and ending up in the high school above it. This time I bought a candle for my mom. There was a decent wind blowing, but there were candle helpers there to get the candle lit and placed properly. Only other place I have done this is St. Patricks Cathedral in NYC. There I was presumed to be a threat and my backpack was searched. Here...I had help and was not treated as a threat. Very nice."
Very peaceful.,"It's surprising how peaceful it is here despite it being right in the middle of the city. I visited once by chance as I was passing by and liked it so much I went back for their one day temple stay. We made traditional tea, meditated and made lotus lanterns - a great insight if you don't have a couple of days to give to a temple stay or if you're not sure how you feel about 4am meditation and hours of silence!"
"Pretty basic, but lacks in aweinspiringness","We found it in front of the North front of the Coex mall easily and took a stroll around. There weren't that many people and you could hear monks chiming around the place (followed by groups of tourists)The hall with the many red paper lanterns is quite beautiful, and so are the statues, but it isn't as inspiring as many were not built many years ago, but recentlyBe prepared for quite muddy ground and few English signs. TheOne that were translated were written in a confusing way, while referring to statues and decorations without stating properly where it can be found or being in proximity of them."
