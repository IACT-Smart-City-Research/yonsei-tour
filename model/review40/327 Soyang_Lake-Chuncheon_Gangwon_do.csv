"Its a lake, that is pretty.","This is an artificial lake up behind Soyang Dam, you can ride a boat around to a temple. The water level has been dropping over the years, but there's still plenty left. I enjoy cycling up and then coasting back down again."
Beautiful peaceful place,"It was hot out and all I wanted to do was jump in the water but they told me that the water is really cold and you can't go swimming. Bucheon was such an amazing place in the country side surrounded by nature. It is much slower paced than Seoul, smaller shops and locations. Very nice"
Took the boat tour ride ,"It's part of my tour itinerary , we visited this lake and took a boat ride , it was nice & relaxing here , taking a break from Seoul city life . "
Lake,Make sure to get the number 11 bus as the 150 goes on a much longer route. The lake is very beautiful with a viewing platform up a short but very steep hill on the far side of the dam.
Huge Dam and lake,"Maybe it's just me but the dam is more interesting than the lake! The lake is pretty and the surroundings beautiful but the dam is apparently the largest rock fill dams in Asia. I guess there are bigger dams using a different technology but this is pretty impressive. There are several busses running frequently from Chuncheon so it's easy to reach on public transport. There is a nice walk across the dam, up a short steep hill to a pagoda with fine views. The visitor centre and exhibition doesn't cater for English unfortunately. There is a hydro electric plant that generates 200,000kWhr and the dam holds back 29 million tonnes of water. Worth a visit but don't miss the boat ride and walk to a stunning ancient temple. "
A visit to Soyang Lake,"You could see a big dam if you visit Soyang Lake. After visiting the Nami Island, you could visit Soyang Lake as your next destination. Soyang lake is a quiet place with beautiful scenery."
"Nice lake, be sure to walk across the dam to get to the pagoda","Soyang lake is truly a beautiful sight. The lake is nice, but enough nicer are the mountains. If you look downstream, on the other side of the dam, you can almost see the city of Chuncheon, which is also very nice. I'd really recommand walking all the way across the dam to reach the dam on top of a small (but fairly steep) hill. The view from there is breahtaking. Also, be sure to take a boat ride, be it for going to Cheongpyeongsa or just navigating on the lake."
Wonderful Lake,"This lake is very beautiful. Beside, you can check out Soyang dam too. A lot of flowers, trees are there."
"""Beautiful like Postcard""","I and my husband did one day trip Soyang Lake- via famous Dakgalbi Chucheon restaurant- via A Twosome Place Cafe Chunseon Gubongsan branch. If you are a road trip lover, this itinerary is highly recommended. The scenery was spectacular and ideal for photo taking at Soyang Dam. Sky was crystal clear and so fresh. For famous dakgalbi restaurant, we tried Tongnamu dakgalbi jib (통나무 닭갈비), not so fancy for us but its a MUST TRY restaurant in Chucheon. The mentioned A Twosome Place had a stunning view and turn to be super romantic place with sunset view <3 <3 <3"
A great place for a day trip outside of Seoul!,"The dam is pretty large but what makes this place so amazing is the scenery all around it. I got at least 20 good shots on my camera. You can walk across the bridge, walk up the hill, get some pictures at the pagoda on the hill and get a bird's eye view of the whole area. Then if you have time, you can take a nice 20-minute inexpensive ferry ride across the dam to a small temple on a peaceful and quiet island. You can take a taxi to the dam but then easily find two or three buses back to downtown Chuncheon or Chuncheon Station. This is totally worth a visit. You have to love Gangwon-do!"
Very beautiful,I honestly only had 20min in this place as I was rushing to catch a bus but this place was beautiful! Really vast and huge. Would love to spend hours there.
A fun activity for a day,The dam is worth going to see. There are a few restaurants in the area and the area itself good for taking pictures. If you don't have a car you can get to the area by public bus for cheap. They have yours on the dam if you're up for it. 
Calm and peaceful,You can enjoy giant dam and visit temple via 20 minute's boating.Temple itself is not big. But calm and peaceful. 
Soyang,"Very nice place- amazing to see such a huge dam in real life- had never seen one before! Went to the temple which was beautiful, had nice food on the walk down and a lovely boat trip over to the island."
