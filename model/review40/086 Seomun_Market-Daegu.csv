Very lively and interesting ,"A huge open-air market which is colorful and heartwarming in offering a slice of Korean life at its best. Everything is sold here from clothing, household goods, plants to food of all varieties. Especially impressed by the stalls selling rice/porridge with intestines (a rarity in Singapore these days) oden and all types of street food. Stall-holders are hard-working and persuasive, calling out to us to buy fresh fish, mainly mackerel, but many varieties of dried goods as well from ginseng to dried shrimp.A wonderful Sunday morning's visit! "
Street Food and More ,"This is an awesome market with a wide variety of foods and clothing, as well as other items. The street food is really awesome and very authentic. Definitely a must do while in Daegu. "
Small but tasty!,"After the Kwangjang Market in Seoul, anything will feel smaller, with fewer choices and fewer people. But the Seomun Market is still a worthy destination to try lots of different dishes and you will never get food this close to the fire. Delicious scallops, BBQ Chicken, Mung Bean Pancakes all prepared and served in minutes. You walk, eat, walk, eat and yo can even duck into one of the stores along the way to pick up a cold beer."
They are friendly and memorable place,"I visited there with my boyfriend.It’s easy to go there by subway. It’s a huge place, and they sell almost everything. I had tteokbokki with fried thin dumpling and kimbab. It was total 7,000won. The taste was okay. But I think it’s not original taste. I think they modfied the taste to forigners. I was abit a shamed of it. Anyway, eventhough the place was super crowded, I enjoyed there as much as I can. Oh, if I have change to visit there again, I would like to be there at night. "
Not bad,"I found this spot randomly while taking a walk to see the area of my hostel. Quite interesting place, lot of good looking food and kins people. Not so many sellers knew english but in the end it was not so big problem."
Nice market,Seomun Market is large and has many shops. Went on a Sunday and most shops were open. Street food and other goods available for sale. 
Nice kalguksu,"Though they have wholesale center here, the retail price of clothes are high and definitely not wholesale pricing. In fact the clothes are more expensive than those like Who.au, uniqlo or small boutiques in junggung ro. Daegu is known for napchang (flat fried dumpling wrap with japchae). Daegu offers more noodle than rice option. A lot of bakery and pharmacy here. The usual food fare like fried chicken , fried pancake in Seoul are not widespread here. "
Things ,There were a lot of people and stalls during the day. Many were closed for the lunar new year. At night there were a lot of food stalls that came out. 
Great food,Great food at the night market and very cheap! It's an easy subway trip in from anywhere in Daegu and worth visiting. 
Disappointed that place was closed,"Google indicated that the night market is opened everyday. The sign at the market stated so as well. But guess what, we went there at 7:30pm, and the whole market was closed! We were so disappointed."
So much street food!,"This place is great if you're looking to get some street food. It's made right before your eyes and everything we had was delicious. You can also go shopping for clothes and I believe I saw a Christmas store in here as well, so you could go there for decorations and such. It is quite large. The only annoying thing is that motorcyclists are constantly coming down the pedestrian footpaths, so you need to be careful of them. Otherwise, a very fun place to walk around!"
Great experience ,We had a good time eating there ... from the hand kneaded Sujebi to hotteok and sikhye. Lots of wholesale household items and clothes 
It could be better if not for public holiday ,"Our visit clashed with korean public holiday so all non-food stalls are closed. Many food stalls, come here with empty stomach and You might find things u like to eat "
Very Authentic and interesting shopping,"Lots of clothes, produce, fish, fish, fish, crafts, food, food, food. Just an enjoyable area to walk around. i think we spent a good two hours wandering around all the shops and alleys. Very interesting to see all the food and merchandise vendors. i really enjoyed it so much i didn't get any pictures inside lol"
go on an empty stomach,"typical night marketlots of food options, but it was too crowded, leading to very long queues.but the food was worth it"
Experience the locals way of life,"This is a typical Korean open market where almost everything is sold here where the local people would go for their daily necessities. There are lots of local food to try and taste at a much cheaper price. It is easily accessible by the metro. We dropped off from the City Tour bus. Go and walk through the place and see, smell and taste the ingredients used in their cooking."
Not so big night market with good street food,"As Daegu is not a big city, there's not many things to do in the night. Seomun Night Market is a place to be. There are probably about 30 food stalls. Make sure you don't go alone as you will be full after one or two dishes. Go with 4-5 guys to try 5-6 food stalls. We ended up at a Bingsu place with a nice Bingsu with black sesame seed."
Typical market with long history and several events such as fire and so on...,"Seomoon market is a popular market. It is famous for the history and the size of the market. And it had undergone several fires including recent one happened in 2016.Inside, you can find many small food booth or restaurants which Korean people enjoy. You may find your food there. And it's very cheap comparing with foods of other restaurant."
Very Cool!,Well worth a visit when you get to Daegu to get a sense of the local flavor. Very fun and easy to get to. 
The best Street food market in Korea !,It’s too local and there are many kinds of food you can try. Prices are cheap and people are so kind. It’s not hard for the foreigner at all because they have a tourist information counter to help. I recommend you to try to go in the day and night ! 
Don’t miss this if you visit Daegu,"It looks easily accessible by bus or subway, but we enjoyed the 25 minute walk from City Center. Wow! So many things to look at, buy, eat!! From fish to towels to silk to clothing, and so much more. It’s so big I’m sure we didn’t see half of it. We bought really cute baby clothes for our granddaughter. "
"A bustling market, but don't come with a car","If you love the bustle and hustle of a typical Korean marker with lots of street food, you'll love this place. Just don't take your car here if you can help it. Parking (we came here on a Saturday afternoon) can be chaotic."
Local flavour at Seomun ,"Awesome shopping experience. Non veg food lovers delight. Shoo fro clothes , artifacts , goodies, so much more. Local bank within to have ur money exchanged at a fair price"
Daegu Visit,A perfect cool hill station . Worth visiting.Must visit seoman market in daegu. Its very near to the down town.its all in one go.items of travel fashion food and souvenirs special to South Korea.travel is very easy by road or by subway .English written mostly.Food is very tasty.More diversity and a bit cheaper rates.
Treats galore,"This market offers anything your heart could desire. There were household items, souvenirs, vegetables, dried sea creatures, jewelry, clothes, etc. what was the very best though was a little fried pancake with sunflower seeds and cinnamon sugar wrapped inside. We found these several places in Korea, but non as good as at this market. "
"When you think of Asian market, this is beyond what you imagine!","What a crazy, cool place to visit during the day in Daegu! If you can only visit one place while there, this is the place to go! It's totally chaotic and full of the widest array of products - half of which you will have no idea what they are. We spent about four hours wandering this expansive bazaar and I had to go back a second to finish exploring. Definitely check this place out!"
Very big market with lots of things,"It is a very big market where you can get pretty much anything. From clothing to street food, drinks, souvenirs and more. It Most of the market is covered so you can visit it in the rain as well. It has good connections with Line 3 and is not very far from downtown."
was FUN!!!,Ho-dduck with seeds and nuts.Korean Rice Hotdog (corndog)Kal-guk-soo (noodle)fishcake-bar (takeaway available)Dutchcoffee (on floor B1 of the Section 2 Building)
Good shopping area,Cheap clothes and interesting market. Different district sell different items. Very interesting to experience as a foreigner. But no bargain at all. The t shirt as cheap as 5000won
A nighttime street food goldmine,"While the market is open during the day, it's more vibrant at night when pushing 100 stalls line the street. There are all manner of things, but the food is the biggest draw. It ranges from standard stuff (burgers and steak) to the exotic (fried octopus, chicken feet) to the bizarre (deep fried milk)."
Crowed and Fun,"I have been here a few times when I lived in Daegu. I would go here often to get good street food and other things that are cheaper at the market then at home plus or E Mart. Yes it is crowed. Yes, people are not always polite. And Yes, it does smell like a bunch of things but a market is a market. The street food is great and if you wanna sample Korea what better way than at the market. If you go during the early part of the day, you can go alone if you are confident in your Korean or just brave. But it is more fun to go with friends and more street food comes out at night.I also had the privilege of my Korean family helping get a traditional dress or Hanbok there at the market. You can get a custom made one or a pre made one. Also if you are a little on the larger side like myself then you can find some clothes at the market that may fit.Pretty much anything you want you can most likely find there. "
A Pike Street Market on Steroids!,"Taking in the sights, sounds and aroma of a traditional Korean market was exhilarating. Imagine if Seattle's Pike Market and a flea market were combined, now for a size perspective situate it over 2 football fields. It's easy to fit in here because everyone is here for the same purpose. We were there perhaps two hours, arriving in the morning. One doesn't want to come here on a weekend or after 12.00 noon-- it'll be too crowded and parking probably not had. "
New night market worth a try,"for those who love street food, the night market is worth a visit! nice food around and very vibrant vibes. not too far from train station so it's convenient too :)"
Not as exciting,"Very crowded, have to squeeze past everyone. Good to eat. Have to go through aisles to get to buy clothes. But it is the top attraction and you get to eat good food."
Traditional Korean market - and night market too.,"Seomun Market is a traditional Korean Market that sells just about everything. From housewares to clothing to food, you can find it all here. Wander around both inside and out (there are market stalls on the street as well as department-like stores that are several floors high. Although the vendors don't speak much English, they are happy to serve. You'll be surprised how far body language and smiles will get you!And the night market is amazing. There is live entertainment, all kinds of traditional Korean food and a carnival like atmosphere."
서문시장 Seonum Market,"You can see traditional craft and food, drinks in Seonum Market. Actually this meaning is south market in Daegu. After entering this market you can see lots of stores and trucks are located on both sides. They are selling toy, scarf, clothing,dessert, snacks and so on. Not only korean food but you can see variety of food from another country. Also there are many tables you can drink with food that you bought from food truck.Enjoy your food and see event for visitors. Some people play instrument or sing and dance. You have to make sure that if you go there they will accept only cash. Usually that market opens from 6:00 p.m. to 12:00 p.m.When you visit raining day you may have inconvenience to line up under the owing.So I recommend this place in cool day with your Freinds or Family"
Great place with food,"Is a fusion of heritage and modern.With stores selling traditional korean food along side cafes that sells coffees.It is also a market that has a number of textile and clothes stores.However, when visiting in March, portion of the market still remain closed due to a previous fire.Overall, it doesnt affect the experience of the whole market."
Amazing variety,"Just about everything you can think of is sold here. Hugely entertaining to just wander around getting lost in the maze of lanes & stalls. Daegu is famous for its textile industry and there are plenty of reasonable quality fashion items here undercover as well as the cheaper stuff. Outside food stalls with fresh produce, small fish, and unidentifiable objects. Bustling and well worth a few hours. Easy to get to on the metro."
Don't miss this experience,"Easy to reach by bus or ""C"" monorail line. Thinking we might spend about 2 hours hear and ended up spending 5 hrs. Still didn't see everything. Went on a Sunday, light crowd in morning but picked up around lunch. Take time to browse and soak in the experience.Try food from the stalls and vendors. Impressed at how all food vendors displayed their goods like pieces of art. You can spend a lot or as little as you please."
Lots to See and Buy,"Hundreds and hundreds of stalls with all kinds of food, clothes, and much much more. Crowded and exciting. Very much worth a visit if in Daegu."
Bustling and fun,"It gets really crowded so go early, although on Sunday the market stalls don't really get open until late morning. The market mostly has food, textile goods, handbags and shoes. Some touristy items are here too, but not too pervasive. "
"Busy, vibrant and cheap!","Seomun Market has over 4000 shops and is almost always crowded! A number of these are food stalls serving very reasonably-priced traditional Korean dishes and snacks. If you are searching for fabric, jackets or knock-off tracksuits, then this is definitely the place to go. BUT before going, please prepare yourself for the crowds and the ajummas elbowing you as they try to push past."
Since the fire ,"The market is still a bustling place. There are still many many vendors open despite the recent fire. Only one building burned down, across from the parking garage, and they have blocked it off. Everything else is still open. I enjoy the fabric district in particular. "
Great street food,"Seomun Market is the biggest traditional market in Daegu. Lots of shops selling foods, linen and clothes. Great to visit if you're looking for gifts to send home. Best part of the market is the street food. Be sure to try the Ssiat Hotteok (씨앗호떡) - a type of Korean pancake stuffed with sunflower seeds. Unfortunately a recent fire has destroyed some sections of the market."
Highlight of Daegu,"When in Daegu, you must visit Seomun market for the best of Daegu's street food such as sliced dumplings and kalguksu. It's very cheap as well! In Seomun market, there's also different sections to explore but a pity the recent fire broke out caused one of the sections to be damaged and destroyed. Will definitely return here next time I visit Daegu!"
Lots of shops. ,"Lots of shops and speciality stores. They have everything you need from fresh meat to linens. The street food is interesting, definitely try out every cart. "
"The biggest traditional market in Daegu, worth a visit if you've never been to one before.","There are bigger traditional markets in Seoul, but Seomun Market is the biggest one in Daegu. If you've never been to one you really should check it out (bring your camera!). Also, the market is now open at night (trying to stimulate local businesses) and you can get a wide variety of Korean street food. Feel free to try and haggle but if you don't speak Korean expect to pay whatever price you are initially offered. Better yet, bring a Korean friend with you!"
Been there for the street food,Here is the problem. The street food was very nice with many many vendors. However the market basically has burned down recently. The street vendors have not reappeared yet. Hold off on any visit until damage is repaired.
Great street food ,"The night market starts after 1900 , but if you want to see the mobile yellow market stalles being set up , be there at 1830. All stalls roll down onto the street from a parking area. The food is very good and there is a lot of choice, though I skip the entrails. "
An authentic market,"The place is huge! The have everything, but so much of everything that it is difficult to find what you are looking for. After awhile it all seems the same, mountains and mountains of stuff. They do have decent food everywhere, although it was a shame we could not just buy 1 single (huge) Korean apple to try..well, lets say we weren't prepared to pay ₩2000 for said apple. Worth a visit if you are doing the tourist thing here.."
what is the fuss,"this is a cool and interesting place plenty of vendors and street food you can find almost anything you desire there, I enjoyed just watching the people there which there was plenty of them "
Night Market!,They've recently opened a permanent night market for all the food stalls (alot of fusion ones!) and the price is average. Some really really nice stalls and there's normally people performing down the street!Really nice place to chill out.
Great deals,"My family learned to ride the subway in Daegu and got off at the stop of Seomun Market. What a fun place to shop. They have stores of all types, food of all types, and an overall inviting atmosphere. It is worth the visit, again and again."
Fun shopping,Seomun market is always fun to go to. One could spend hours there just browsing and window shopping. Lots of food to try and sights to take in. It's a great way to get to know the local culture. 
You have to really walk around to take it all in...don't forget to go to the underground stores!Q,"Pictures are not enough...you need the smell and sound of it all too. So many stores, so many different types."
A busy traditional market ,"So many things to buy, so many food to try... every one walking, taking, buying... but original of a lot product is from China."
Very busy but very fun,"It is fun to just walk around and window shop. There is excellent food and interesting shops. Parking might be difficult on the weekends and it will be packed. But besides that, it's a good visit."
Nice Asian market,"And yes, there are a lot of markets. This market is not very different from other markets in Asia or South Korea. But I love markets. They give you the idea of the locals, you can eat good street food and enjoy at least an hour, preferrably 1,5 hours, overhere."
Check out the food section,"Yet another market with good that start to look the same. This one however had a food section full of vegetables, nuts, legumes and seafood which is worth a stroll past.Vendors selling fried donuts stuffed with red bean paste filling. Plenty of clothing vendors which seemed to be cheaper than those in Seoul markets. "
Bargain Shopping and Haggling ,"Great one stop shop for street food, knock off clothing, bags and backpacks, and strange smells. This is a spot not to miss!"
Huge!,"This market was ginormous. Lots to see, eat and smell! Good food and great people. This was a great cultural experience. I took my visitors there and they completely enjoyed wandering the stalls and shops. Buy the hotteok!! "
"For street food lovers,this is unmissable","Keep 3 hours minimum of you want a full sense of this buzzing market with roadside grub wholesale deals and checking out the world of South Korean fashion,relatively affordable style"
Great Place,"I've used this market for many years and you can basically find anything from food to clothes and all sorts of odd things. It's excellent for tailor made clothes and especially Korean style, modernised-traditionally clothing. I've bought, grain, nuruk for making magkeolli and, material for making boxer shorts. The textile area is enormous and one of the biggest in Korea. It's easy to get lost and if you find a store you like make sure you know exactly where it is or you might not find it so easily second time around. Also, consider the heat/humidity and plan your journey at cooler times of day."
A market with local character,"This is a large market with local character in that there is a good mixture of traditional stores and stalls offering things from Korean ginseng and other herbal products, food for on-premises consumption including pig instestines, snacks and pan-fried food, clothing items, fabrics, vegetables, seafood, flowers and sundries to coffee and cakes. While the variety of food and goods for sale may not be too interesting to many foreign tourists, the market is certainly a good place for getting a better quick understanding of Korean food, culture, life styles, traditions and living standards and provides good materials for photographers."
One of the biggest traditional Korean market!,This market is really big and unique where you can find many items from food to clothes and many more!
Good times,I went looking for yarn and yummy Korean fried food. I found both plus a ton of other really awesome nicknacks. I go back at least once a month.
"huge, cheap market!","One of the oldest traditional market that you can find in South Korea, one word - Bargain! they marked up everything by at least 50%, i bought one jacket, marked at 87000, reduced to 56000, not bad eh?Good food inside the market, try the traditional daegu flat dumpling it's' very good!There are lots of buildings here if you don't want to get lost, go to the information desk and get a map before you explore, there are both indoor and outdoor shoppings available."
Cheap market ,"Cheap market Cute stuffs Young mom clothing all in one with baby toddler and plates Accesories Bargain cash deduct further won 2,000 minimum Easy to eat and to get a taxi "
Way too much!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"If you are going to the market, get a map prior to going unless you want to wander aimlessly around looking at things all day. my first visit I was there for 3 hours and couldn't find anything I wanted when I walked around inside it was okay because I didn't have anything in particular in mind. Now 5 times later I know before I go :) and I have a map to search out places prior to me taking the ride to the market. There is plenty of parking if you decide to drive across from the market but for the subway naves the subway is right there practically in the market."
Interesting visit at the seomun market ,"I am always wanting to see markets and places which are popular in the cities I visit. The Seomun market ticked the box of a lace to see as its completing different to what we are used to in the west. The market is pretty big and you can easily get lost in the place. The market is easy to get to, having a car isn't an issue as there's a nice big Parkin lot next to it. If you use public transport you have buses, taxis and also metro which looks pretty cool. There plenty of local food to try but try and your own risk ;) "
Just another Korean market,"This is a large market but nothing really sets it apart from other larger Korean markets. They have a large variety of goods, clothing, material, food, fresh meats, fresh fruits, etc. Alot of it is civered so that is nice. A few little places to eat, purely Korean food. Worth a visit."
Seomun Market,Great market and food... Near hospitals and Subway.... Found prices higher the Seoul... Great place to see locals.. Try lots of street vendors food...
All your needs and more,"Typical Asian Market. You will find food, clothes and a lot of different other things. A lot of small shops to discover."
Very good place with historical place nearby. ,"Seomun market is very big market. It looks like bigger than Namdaemun market in Seoul. There are big 5 sections in this market with different functions. You can visit Monorail experience, Missionary House, Gyeoseong High school those are located nearby. 3.1 independent movement stairs and hill which was named Gheongra Eondeok. Ssiat Hoddeok (Pancake) taste will be a good experience. :) "
Interesting experience!,"Do it the local Korean way! Food, clothing, kitchenware, textiles, candles, shoes, fresh veggies and fruits...and very cheapOrganized and clean! "
VERY NICE TO GO CHEAP SHOPPING!,This Korean traditional market is so big and you'll see everything you need. You will also experience Korean traditional culture.
Get ready to become overwhelmed,"If you don't like crowds don't step foot in this market. Or go on a week day. Other than that this place is HUGE. It has city blocks worth of stuff. Basement and second story levels. I've been 20 times and always find new things. The best way to go is, go with a plan. Everything has sections. A textile section, a cooking ware section, blanket section, etc. learn them and it would be easier. "
Don't be afraid to sit down and try something different,"Having lived, studied and worked in Korea, coming from the UK this is the kind of market that I always want to show my British friends. It is packed with culture, amazing food and the atmosphere on a busy day is just incomparable.Even if you can't speak Korea, just sit down and try all the different kinds of food. It is a great way to spend an afternoon, the food is super cheap.There is a subway stop right outside of the market entrance on the new line 3. Definitely worth a visit. For more photos of Korea you can check out my instagram @JamieHurst_"
Interesting but just generic tat ,"Whilst it was fun to wonder the cramped paths between stores, each shop was selling what the last one offered. The food stuffs were interesting, but realistically I'm not buying a squid or a roll of packaged woody looking spices. This place lacks that authentic feel of individuality and surprise that a market should provide. On the plus side it is not touristic, and you can get really well lost, which is fun. From Exco, hop on the 653 to the textile centre stop. Or the Seomun market tube stop on the yellow line. "
Alive,"From clothing to food vendors, there are amazing things to take a look and ""window shop"". The market is so alive and ""home"" feeling. After being in the area for about 2 1/2 weeks, the vendor bosses remember your face ^^ The community is so friendly with great big smiles.. ah I miss walking through the market and saying hello.. Can't wait to go visit next month!!♡♡♡♡"
Huge Market,Definitely must visit place during your trip in Daegu. A lot of foods and stuffs with cheap prices. Pick another day to visit because some vendors closed on Sundays.
Charming Market,"The biggest traditional market in Daegu. Clean, cheapest price, and the variety of products are amazing. Plus, food trip here is all worth it. "
Pang,"I had visited Seomun market with my korean friend name ""Seung Chan"". He bring me to the market at late afternoon. There are market section that open which is wholesale fabric section, local food section and tradition souvenir section. I had try many korean food in that market and the price is good. There are not much tourist out there at the moment. We ate something like pork grill with stick (looks similar to thai food pork grill or ""Mu Yang"") And self service stand alone eating on the street food which I dont know the name. I ordered them 2 sticks of some source of fishball which dipped with spicy and sweet souce. It is such a wonderful memory to try that things. I am thankful to my friend for introduce me this place and hopefully to come back one day. ♡♡ Love ♡♡"
Must See in Daegu,"This market is awesome, having a wide variety of exotic foods. It is best to eat from the street vendors to get a good taste of Asia. "
Good,It is a good choice for the person who want to experience traditional market. There are a lot of Korean foods here also.
Seomun Market,"This is where modern and traditional Korea meet.You'll find the latest fashion and traditional Hanbok shops and everything else in between because this huge market caters for the day to day lives of the locals.Spend a few hours walking through the market and find out how the locals live, what they eat, use and wear. Pick up souvenirs and nice things to decorate your home or office desk with. Price is well below upmarket shops but products are good quality too.This is the place to get a beautiful Hanbok made to measure with accessories. There's one to suit your budget."
Little bit of everything!,"You could pretty much find anything there. It is huge place, divided into sections of simular items. Definitely fun to look around and get some street food!This market is very busy on the weekends. I prefer going there during the week in the mornings."
Overwhelming Variety and Great Food,"Seomun Market is the main large market in Daegu. It is covered, and consists of many buildings with alleyways between. I recommend searching blogs about Daegu to find out hidden gems here. It's a little overwhelming if you just go in with no information. Even better, if you know a local or can get a guide, do. There is some great food on offer at the ""outdoor"" (it's all covered) food stands. Look for a stand with people waiting in line. Try some of the local favorites: tteokboki (sort of like rice gnocchi in a red sauce), hotteok (fried dough with brown sugar cinnamon filling), and mandu (a kind of dumpling, but look especially for the flat mandu, a specialty of Daegu). Souvenir shops are hard to find here, but they are in there. Get a local to show you. The hanbok (traditional Korean clothing) shops are wonderfully colorful. You can also find interesting natural dyed clothing and reasonably-priced silver and gemstone jewelry. But there's everything here, including airplane parts, so try to find the section that has the things you're interested in."
Market time,Great place to find spices material and ole skool korea. Great tra shops and knick knacks. Will go ahain.
Always interesting,I go to this market often as it's across the street for my doctor's office. You can pretty much find what ever you're looking for there. It's usually for a decent price. The closer to closing time you go the more the vendors are willing to negoiate on prices.I go to this market often as it's across the street for my doctor's office. You can pretty much find whatever you're looking for there. The closer to closing time you go the more the vendors are willing to negotiate on prices. With subway and monorail stops close by it’s very easy to get to without the hassle of driving and trying to find somewhere to park. I’ve also eaten there. The food isn’t bad and it’s cheap. This market is huge and can easily take a couple of hours or more to walk the entire area. Also don't overlook the stores on the streets bordering the market. Lots of good deals there as well.
Chaotic but Interesting,"This is a good place to get reasonably priced produce and household goods. They also have beautiful hanboks, souvenirs, and fabric. It is fun to eat at the street stalls which have delicious food. However, the crowds and pushing are annoying and it is easy to get lost. "
"Fun, Food and a Little Shopping","As with all countries in the Pacific Rim countries, Daegu has a weekend market. We started with some Korean pastry that we munched on as we wandered from stall to stall. It was hot and very flavorful. Visitors to this market can probably find anything they want. There were food stalls of all kinds: raw meat, fresh fish, pastry, drinks, fruit, nuts, and more. Several stalls offered the the traditional Korean Hanbok formal dress. There were all sizes (very young girls to adults) and bright colors and patterns. There were leather goods, cooking utensils, toys and more. It was a fun way to spend some time while in Daegu. Prices are very reasonable and they welcome bargaining. The serious shopper can pick up many good bargains. Most stalls accept cash or credit cards and they will wrap your purchases for travel if you ask."
not only a market - it's a district,"I went there alone by taxi, but I saw a big amount of busses, all stopping at the ""main"" entrance. There is also a train going there.For me as an european (austria) it was overwhelming on how little space you can sell you many things.If you are looking for something special you will definately need a guide who speeks korean. Like nearly everywhere else in Daegu, nobody speeks english.But I decided just to walk through the buildings and streets.For me it was actually more interessting to walk through the streets around the tall shopping buildings.What totally surprised me was the fact that they are selling clothes next to raw fish, next to bedding, next to fruit, next to shoes, next to dried fish.It has been worth to visit - i can totally recommend to visit the roof of the malls, i think it is normaly only for workers there, but I took a 20 min sun-rest there and totally enjoyed the silence of the flowers growing up there. Beside the big fan where all the cooking-smells came out...It's a must to see this!"
Lots to see and explore!,"I visited this market several years ago and wanted to return to see if it had changed. I was happy to see that it had not and there were exciting, unusual things to see around every corner. The first time, I spent the good part of a day exploring because there was so much to see and the booths inside and out seemed endless. It was overwhelming, so it was nice to return with a bit more perspective and be able to concentrate more on the people and the food rather than the endless spaces filled with all types of wares. Watch out for the motorbikes that speed through the narrow aisles filled with shoppers. You can hear them coming, but they still catch a lot of folks off guard. Everyone was friendly with the exception of one woman who was set up on the street leading to the market. She waved me off when I moved in to get a closer look at a bowl full of squirming tiny eel like creatures. Her behavior was highly unusual in comparison to the the welcoming gestures that most women demonstrate. In May next year, there will be a third subway line that will have a stop even closer to the market, but the walk from line 2 is not far and is interesting in it's own right."
Close early,"Not like other markets that open until late at night, this market close early. I went there about 9PM and I found nothing there. Not even one store. So it's better to have a visit in the morning or afternoon "
Dissappointing maket,"I had big expectations before visiting this market, and it covers a huge area. However, it happens to be full of bric-a-brac that you can get everywhere, or fine Korean handicrafts that are very expensive or heavy to trasport. It was disappointing how many products are not Korean made. So many European and Chinese obejcts... Nevertheless, if you want to buy vegetables, nuts, fruits, non-expensive clothing, and some small budget souvenirs, you will find them here!! There are others specialized market and mouch more interesting to visit, like the handmade shoes, jewerly, tradicional medicine, etc."
Sensory overload!,"It has so many things to offer: clothes, food, paper, luggage, gifts, pottery, jewelry,toys and fabrics. It was packed with so many goods it's hard to take it all in. The shop owners were friendly. The smells of some of the fish market areas were a bit overwhelming. Got a great deal on some sportswear. Enjoyed a lunch at a little ""food court"" spot with spicy Korean food. "
Biggest Market in Daegu - Must see and experience,"Unless you'll be going to Seoul or Busan, Daegu's Seomun Market is a must see for anybody coming to Daegu. It's a great combination of all kinds of products for sale that will fit almost any need. The place recently has been remodeled with some new buildings. Anything from fruit, pots, pans, fabric, clothing, crafting, and so much more can be found. Sundays are pretty busy and yet, I do believe they can be closed on certain Sundays. There is parking available if driving, or easy access from the subway. I would plan for at least half day or more. Grab a map from the tourist center or you will get lost!!!"
Biggest Market in Daegu,"I always love traditional market (and shopping). Since i live in a small city outside Daegu, come into the downtown is a nice activity i would like to do whenever i have time. Mostly because Daegu downtown has many places for shopping, one of its well-known place is Seomun Market (Seomun Sijang). You can take the line 1 subway to get here or simply by city bus. From Yeungnam University might take the bus number 840 or 909, and you will get there roughly in 1 hour.This traditional market complex is very big, they divide the building for clothes section (adult and kids are also separated), home appliances and fresh raw material (as fish, vegetables and so on). They also have one section that sell korean souvenirs like key chains; postcards; traditional fan; etc. Not to forget that hanbok (korean traditional dress) with its accessories are available in here.Seomun market is the biggest traditional market in Daegu, so it is worth to visit. You might find yourself swirled in a labyrinth of shops. And I need to remind you that this place has various super cutie things from as little as beads. You can indulge yourself in a time-travel shopping, from antiques to modern style.If you need extra energy to troll around in this market, you might wanna sit a while in the alley and enjoy Korean street food such as ttokbokki, cold ramyeon, pajon (korean pizza), etc. Even if you’re not feeling hungry, when you look at the food, you just cant help not to drool over.A tip for shop in Semun Sijang, try trolling inner part of the market, cause in outer shop, price are a bit higher. Unless you can show your great ability to bargain. And always try for a discount price about 1/3 till ½. Saying you are a student is also helpful in getting cheaper price. Have a joyful shopping experience :D"
Souvenirs shop,"I spent half day in Seomun market. I went there with my Korean buddy. It is a traditional market with many little stores and people. The stores sell quite different things from food, clothes, shoes, bags, until the traditional souvenirs from South Korea. There are several souvenirs shop but i found this one and i thought it's the best. As a moslem women, it's always been hard for me to find halal food for me in Korea. So i chose odeng/omug and tteokbokki as my lunch that day. It was delicious and tasty. There are also some fruit vendors and lots of snacks on the street. I recommend you to visit this market at least once.It's easy to get there. Just take subway and get off at Seomun station or use the bus 649 or 440."
True Korean Experience; a must-see in Daegu,"Seomun is the largest and most diverse of the (at least) three traditional markets in Daegu (Chilseong is the other that is definitely worth visiting: on Subway Line 1). Seomun is not just a fish market, which is amazing, but the main buildings are a labyrinth of stores and stalls the likes of which are most unique. From traditional Korean wedding gown shops all clustered on the same floor to flowers and hot chili peppers bound in a five-foot twist, there are new things to see at every turn. Plan to spend at least an hour there and have some food, either soup or mandu (dumplings) as there are none more authentic (or as cheap). Just get off Line 2 on the Subway one stop west of the main transfer point, take exit 5, go back and head up the small side streets on the north side of the main drag and you will find it."
