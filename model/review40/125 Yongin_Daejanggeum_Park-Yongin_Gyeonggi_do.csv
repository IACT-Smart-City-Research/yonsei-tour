A Must-Visit Place in Yongin,"We didn't expect much on plan for this place, but we were very wrong! It was unfortunate that our GPS got us to nowhere. We finally found the place after some effort and trying to get instructions from the locals. But we wasted precious time, arriving at 4pm and the place closed at 5pm.We decided to pay extra to take the buggy introductory ride due to time constraint, and we strongly recommend it if you don't have much time and don't want to be walking up slope. The place is magnificent! It brings back memories of some of the historic Korean dramas we had watched in the past and recently. We were literally like walking through a historic site! It was off season, and hence we could take photos of the place as if we were the only ones there.Go see it for yourself!"
Korean dramas came to life,"I have always been a fan of KDramas and visiting this filming location was all but a dream come true. For all fans who will visit South Korea, this is definitely a must see! This is a huge complex so prepare to walk and prepare your cameras as there are a lot of insta-worthy spots, from acting out as if your a Queen to a normal villager, therr are literally a lot to choose from. We were even lucky enough (probably luckier than any other visitors) to watch an actual filming and they were friendly enough to let us take picture with them, oh what a dream! So if your a fan, be sure to make this a whole day activity since only a fee hours is not enough."
Korean Telenovela location!,Nice place to see Korean old villages and houses. We even saw cast's shooting a new telenovela. My niece rented the korean dress(hanbuk) worn on the telenovela to have a photoshoot! 
weekend visit,I went to Suwon many times during a visit to South Korea.There are people walking around in Native Clothing from the Joeseon area that you can take pictures with also. A must see when in Suwon.
Reading Reviews made this better,"I thought it was great. I had fairly realistic expectations because I've had a VIP tour of studios in California and I'd also read reviews of the place before I went, so I knew what to expect. I have seen a few of the dramas that had been shot there but not the main big dramas that had large amounts of scenes set there... I went to the movie set park more for the curiosity value of looking behind the movie magic, the reality, not to See it in action. I really enjoyed it. Some areas are terrifically evocative and others are disappointingly pragmatic fakery...but isn't that why movie majic is so clever, and has curiosity value in its own right? If you're a Kdrama fan with imagination, who isn't naiive enough to think drama makers who've invested millions of €£¥$ in making a drama so aren't likely to permit teams of uncontrollable, nonprofessional strangers near the area where movie WORK is being done, you'll have a great time. My only complaint was that I wish there had been more interpretive material available, such as a brochure with more information from dramas showing more photos of every part of the sets with action photos from the scenes shot there... there was a little information available, but only about 5% of what I wanted. My other complaint is not the fault of the Park itself. I bought entry to the site as part of another tour I bought via the Viator tour broker, and my tour didn't spend enough time there. To be fair, some people march through these things at a fair clip; a couple of people on my tour seemed to think the brief skim through the place was OK, but more than half of us were constantly being hassled to keep moving on, which meant I didn't get my money's worth. I would return if I were ever to get an opportunity, but I'd do it by myself, not through an organized tour."
Shooting Drama Set,"THis is a Big area of a set of Korean Drama, so many movies was shoot in this area. Nice and big with real property of the set."
Couple,"The place is soo nice and it's huge. We enjoy taking pics... i love the hanok village , we plan to visit again with the family.."
The worst experience ever...,"I came here last April with a group of girlfriends. It was truly disappointing. First off, I would like to say we saw them filming Empress Ki, we saw the main actress (Ha Ji Won) going into a room inside the main building (not a set). Her bodyguard told us not to bother or try to take pictures. I didn't even know who she was until one of my friends recognized her. Plus, we weren't even thinking about taking any pictures of her. Second, when you enter the second floor where they have tourists dress up in Hanboks, for a fee, the lady tried to sell you the package hard! It's a turnoff. Finally, ppl could wander around the sets however, we arrived to one location where they were shooting the drama mentioned above. The director was cursing us out in Korean to get the hell out. By the way, there were no signs to warn us not to enter. I don't understand their gimmick. Aren't you supposed to be nice to people since they charge you a fee?!! This experience was a waste of time and money. I highly don't recommend this place and it's far from the city."
Beautiful,"This is a famous drama shooting location, Korean drama fans will love this place as you get to see the setting, ancient buildings and villages that appeared in the drama. There are lots of photos taking opportunities here. As it's winter season, most of the roof tops of the buildings were covered with snow, it's really a beautiful sight when we looked down at the area from higher grounds. It's a long journey getting to this place from Seoul city, so please set off early if you want more time to explore this place."
Dramatic,"First need to get the directions correct. Exit 5 at nambu bus terminal subway. Once you exit, do a u - turn cos the terminal is behind. The exit. The entrance to the terminal is to your right, right away. It is at a corner. You got to purchase the ticket. The bus doesn't accept T-Mobile at this interchange. Ticket is ₩4500. Boarding platform is 18. Journey is about 50 mins and alight at baegam(bay come ) bus terminal. The stop is announced in English. After alighting, turn left and walk straight a little. taxi stand is right there. Tell cabbie mbc dramia and you are on your way. Cab cost is ₩8000 (₩9000 of you call for 1 at mbc dramia). Good for 3 hours of slow exploration and for spotting drama sets which might not be shown on the pamphlet. Bring umbrella and a sweater as it can be quite cold when it rains or unless you want to be stuck at an ancient hut doing nothing."
Walking into Korea Historical eras,MBC Dramia is a famous Korean film/video drama shooting location. It has buildings in settings looking like functioning villages and built according to different dynasties.
Much more than I expected,"I went here with a group and it was one of two activities on this day trip from Seoul. I had expected a series of sound stages and facades of buildings. No... They rebuilt an entire village!In some ways it is better than going to some ""real"" historical sites in that it is built to be complete and reconstruct a functioning village for their films and dramas. The day we were there MBC was actually filming. With only an occasional ""shh"" gesture, they let us wander throughout the complex. When the actors were not needed for a particular scene, they gladly posed with visitors for photos.Had I been a Korean Drama addict, I would have given the MBC Dramia 5 stars. Had I spent 4 hours on the road to see only this attraction, 3 stars. Overall, more interesting than I had expected."
Worth visiting!,"From Seoul, we traveled for almost 2 hours to reach Baegam and from there, we rode a cab that sent us to MBC Dramia. I must say that the place was so amazing added to the fact that the staffs were hospitable. The place gives the authentic feel of being transported back to Joseon era. In short, it’s really realistic. I can’t comprehend how they do every details. From the furniture used, if you wouldn’t observe close enough, you can’t tell that it’s just props. The good thing about this place is there is no prohibition, unlike the actual palace wherein you can’t touch items and just stare from afar, here you can play with swords, do archery, touch ceramics/books, enter the rooms, sit on the throne, honestly, you can do everything! But just a tip, if you want to have good photos and fully enjoy the tour, you should be there early on weekdays and not during weekends because the place might be full of tourists. We went there on Monday, and fortunate enough, MBC were filming the last episode of Horse Doctor, we asked for a photo with an actress, and she obliged. We asked if we can watch the filming, but they refused. I guessed, because it’s the last episode, they don’t want to disclose the ending of the story. The other good thing was, there is a shuttle bus waiting near the reception area that will bring you back to the terminal. If there is no bus, the reception lady will arrange a cab for you. Very convenient, right?!"
Worth visiting,"We had to alight from our tourist bus and walk a good distance to the MBC Drama set. From afar, we could already see the billboards and standees of the characters of the popular, Jewel in the Palace. We posed beside some of the markers until we made it uphill to the set. The vast expanse of land re-created a village,a courtyard and a palace. The set looked like an authentic dwelling place for a royal family and his court. Worth visiting by all the avid fans of the drama series!"
Satisfy your korean drama addition...,"If you want a rendezvous of your favorite classic Korean dramas, then visit at MBC dramia, Yongin. The drama set of famous dramas like Queen Seondok, Dongyi and The Moon That Embraces the Sun is about an hour and a half from Nambu Bus terminal, Seoul. The entrance fee is 7000 won as of this writing. The facility also displays the costumes used throughout the filming. You can try one of the costumes of your choice and take a souvenir photo for a cost. The staffs are warm and friendly so it would be okay to ask them to take a picture of you if you happen to travel alone."
