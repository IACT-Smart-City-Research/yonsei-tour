Not the normal theme park,"This place was used as a movie set and tried to be authentic. It was very interesting to people like us with no knowledge of the culture or the history of Namwon. The city is twinned with Verona because of the story of true love as set out in the theme park. The Tale of Chunhyangjeon is a folk tale and love story.With a Folk museum with interactive displays the first place to tour, you gain a historical perspective. Next is the pottery area with a Museum, many working kilns, pottery work shed and an interactive water feature especially for children. The story of the abduction of local potters back to Japan by Japanese soldiers to start the craftsmanship of now famous Satsume pottery was an eye opener to us. Many reconstructed houses for that era 1500's are for viewing and includes a rural school and a public servant's office. A big temple complex also in the theme park and the person where the young women was incarcerated and forced to wear the most abominable neck piece of a huge slab of wood. At the top of the hill is a Science Observatory but closed when we were there."
