A walk to the past!,"Dongguksa Temple (동국사) is the last remnant of Japanese Buddhism in Korea, even though nowadays the temple follows the Korean Buddhism, the architecture is impressive. The temple stays still without the scars of the wars that assailed the peninsula, visiting it, is a visit to the year of 1919, the year that the Japanese occupation conducted a stronger occupation. The temple has very welcoming cats, that I even managed to take a photo of them Also the temple was used as location for the film Ode to the Goose (군산: 거위를 노래하다) directed by one of my favorite directors Zhang Lu. It was interesting to visit some of the locations for this film, the next posts I will explore those locations."
Small but unique temple in Gunsan city.,"C ( 19.08.03 ) The general temple was located in deep mountain, but this Dongguksa in the city's main street. And the temple's structure was Japanese style. So there was not general style temple, and had unique atmosphere. If on Gunsan trip, there was must visit in a short time. Small, but unique temple."
Pleasure,Good placeWent there on Dec 2018Visited with my colleagues Didn’t disappoint Close to Gunsan city Downtown 
Japanese style Buddhist temple in Korea,Beautiful and historic site. It was built in Japanese imperial period.Now a korean monk manages the temple.
Temple,Nice Buddhist Temple in the city. They are rebuilding a lot of it. Several people walking around. Nice statue all dressed up. Went inside seen the budda and drum. Makes for some good pictures.
Interesting,The tour was in Korean so we didn't understand a thing but we walked around by ourselves. It was relaxing a peaceful. 
Dongkuk Temple in Kunsan,This is a japnese-style buddhist temple which was built in the japanese-ruled era. This is located near the japanese-style house village.
Go for the bamboo,"Small, but very beautiful Japanese-style Buddhist temple, apparently the last one of its kind in Korea still operating as a Buddhist temple. For me, the most beautiful aspect of it was the backdrop of magnificent old-growth bamboo, which is also rare in Korea. "
"Small, but pretty","Dongguksa is the only surviving Japanese style temple in Korea. It is rather small, but pretty enough. If you plan to visit, an hour is more than sufficient.Overall, I was a little underwhelmed... but I can appreciate the significance of the temple."
a remnant of sad history,The temple built during the time of Japanese colonization of Korea gives a good example of how religion was used to aid the imperialism against ordinary people and makes one wonder whether and how peace between the two countries can be made.It is absolutely worth a visit along with other related sites in the area
Japanese Temple in Gunsan,"Gunsan is the location of some of the best-preserved Japanese colonial architecture in Korea. For much of Post-WWII Korea, Japanese buildings have been routinely demolished, often with fanfare. It is perhaps understandable considering the brutal Japanese rule Korea suffered under for 35 years. Suprisingly, Dongguksa has survived.Yet, for visitors finding themselves in Gunsan there are several Japanese buildings worth visiting. Even during difficult times of hardship, life continues. Gunsan's colonial architecture is a perfect window into how Japan saw themselves (Liberator of Asia), and the reality (Colonial ruler). At Dongguksa we can explore a Japanese style temple that is still active. This is the only Japanese temple that remains in its original condition in Korea. The temple is only about 100 years old, the layout is elegant and fairly modest. The Korean Buddhists who run the temple today have chosen to preserve the Japanese style structure for its historical value.Within Gunsan there is the Japanese Customs House, built in ""western"" fashion. A wealthy Japanese merchant built his sizable compound, which is a rare, perfectly preserved Japanese house. There is also a Japanese bank and lighthouse. From these structures we can see how Japan tried to assimilate Korea into Japan itself, moreover we also witness Japan attempting to modernize Gunsan as a port city. The juxtaposition of Japan, the perceived ""beacon of modernity in Asia"" and the ""brutal colonizer"" is nowhere so apparent as in Gunsan. For if we study the history, Gunsan port was built primarily to import Korean rice and other goods to Japan (virtually with no benefit to local Koreans). How did this modernize or help Korea at the time?Dongguksa is worth a visit. It is something just not found in 21st century Korea. Japanese buildings that have actual historic value are few and far between in Korea, most have fallen to decay or the wrecking ball. Enjoy this authentic Japanese temple, and venture to see some of Gunsan's rich colonial history. The lesson is an important one."
