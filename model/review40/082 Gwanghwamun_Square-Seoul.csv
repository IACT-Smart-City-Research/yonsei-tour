King Joseon & Admiral Yi Sun Shin Dominate This Square,"Just down from the two large palaces you will find this quite interesting square in the center of the road containing a statue of King Joseon (sitting) and Admiral Yi Sun Shin on a Pedestal.The square also has some interesting potted trees.The Admiral was famous for his battles with the Japanese during their invasion in the 16th Century, at the time Josoen was on the throne."
Traffic Lanes Transformed To Public Square,"Just 10 years ago, this public square replaced 10 traffic lanes as part of various environmentally friendly renovations going on in Seoul. The big rectangle runs from Gwanghwamun Gate on the North to Sejongno Sageon intersection on the South. We walked its length from the intersection, en route to Gyeongbokgung, the city’s premier palace on a Saturday afternoon. I saw no greenery anywhere on the square to soften the effect of its vast concrete underfoot, but many attention-grabbers beckoned, including two big statues.We encountered the first statue almost immediately, at the Southern edge of the square. It depicts a standing Admiral Yi Sunshin (1545-1598), who led the defeat of the Japanese Navy in the Imijin War. A nearby fountain, known as the 12.23, commemorates the admiral’s 23 battles with 12 warships during that war. The second statue, also nicely crafted, appears in the middle of the square, showing King Sejong (1397-1450) seated on a throne. Among other accomplishments, he created the Korean alphabet.While looking around the king’s statue, we discovered an entrance at the rear that led to a lower level with two free exhibition halls focused on the king and the admiral. History buffs, we spent about 1 hour here, learning fascinating information about both men. Returning to sunlight again, we came across a book fair on the square, where many events are held for the public.Three traffic lanes flank both the East and West sides of the square and a Metro entrance is in the square itself. Government administrative offices appear beyond the lanes on the East Side and the Sejong Center (performing arts), which we also visited, is the standout building on the West side."
2 huge statues,The square is large with 2 huge statues of Korea's historical figures. And in the background you can see the mountain and the palace.
Not really a square,A busy main road with a central area surrounded by a few civic buildings sums up the square. Not much to see except a couple of statues and lots of traffic. Leads up to Gyeongbokgung Palace and gate.
Gwanghwamun Square,Not much to do here other than see the statues. I presume they have events here throughout the year. Seems to be popular with tourists. In a great area as there are lots of coffee shops and restaurants nearby. Good to visit after the palace as it’s just outside. 
Noisy protests ruined the day,"There is a fringe political group holding protests in the area - every weekend apparently - they wear earplugs and shout through very loud speakers, block the way and harangue tourists. I would advise staying away until these folks shuffle off."
Lovely Ceremonial Square ,This is the massive and impressive public square in front of the main entrance to Gwanghwamun Palace and its full of interesting statuary and plenty of plaques explain things that used to be there and things that still do! Great views of the palace and its main gate. Loads of life and bustle about and its very close to the main shoppibg areas and lots of eateries.
History,"Great historical figure, lots to learn about the Korean alphabet and their way of thinking based on this historical figure"
Public square in front of Gyeongbokgung Palace,"This square is just in front of Gwanghwamun Gate, the main gate of Gyeongbokgung Palace. The square has 2 imposing statues, ie King Sejong and Admiral Yi Sun-Sin. To know more about the 2 figures, suggest you visit the underground museum, located just behind the statue of the king. Free admission. Nice to spend about 10 to 20 mins enjoying the air con and use the toilet before moving on."
Visit the museum in the basement ,"This is a very formal and grand public square in honour of the well loved Emperor Sejong.There is a museum in the basement (free admissions) which is below the statute of the Emperor. Look for the interesting displays on the history of Korea, Hangeul language and the lifestyle of the early days.You could watch a short movie, which is very informative, in this small museum.Back to the Gwanghwamun Square, there are many spots for nice photos. "
Beautifully situated,"An imposing square -- with a Joceon Palace to the north and statues of King Sejong and Admiral Yi Sun Shin adorning the median. Obviously not worth a trip, but when in the area it makes for a lovely stroll (as long as there are not more anti-American demonstrations along the way, since this is also the site of the US Embassy)."
Gwanghwamun Square VIsit,So magnificent! I loved majestic architecture in this place. I also loved the way that the guide introduce me the history of Korea and this attraction.
Stunning sceney,Absolutely loved the mountains in the background and to see the palace in the distance. The statue is very well made. At the sides of the square is a floor plaque for each year with something written next to it (wasn’t in English so unsure what it said but I found it really intriguing). I loved the buildings and really feeling like you were in Seoul. 
Major promenade leading to Gyeongbokgung Palace,"Along this busy street are many statues and historical markers to Korean history. This is where parades, events and demonstrations happen. At the end of the street is the palace. Well worth walking the entire length."
Good to see on the way to the palace,The statute is massive and situated right in front of the palace entrance so it can’t be missed. We went early and managed to avoid the crowds. 
Big Square in the city,"the squarer surround by the changeoung stream, the king sejong statue, and the gyeungbokgung palace, in front of gwanghwamun gate, exactly in the centre of the city when the modern building mix with the traditional culture"
Underground Museum - Good for a quick look,"We were walking through the square, saw the massive statues of King Sejong and Admiral Yi Sunshin, so we decided to stop in. I found this museum very engaging for being devoted to only two historical figures. Turns out the King Sejong created the Korean language and was an early model for the value of scholarship. Admiral Yi's story is simply amazing and the exhibits in that portion of the museum are fantastic.We intended to just have a quick look and ended up staying for two hours. We were pleasantly surprised.Also, the museum provides (for a charge) activities for kids. We loved making the wood cut prints - my kids still have theirs!If you have some time, stop in and see what this museum has to offer!"
Can’t miss,"On my way to palace G and N market, you can’t miss this square. Easy to walk through, very interesting statues (king and admiral) what is explained. Try the underneath museum. Really good to get a taste of Korean culture and history. "
Visit the memorial to the Sewol ferry victims,"An impressive and centrally located area where you can find colourful water fountains at night, the Statue of Admiral Yi Sun-Sin and Statue of Sejong the Great amongst others. There is also the Memorial to the Sewol Ferry Victims which currently dominates the park as well as a man with a sign protesting the presence of American troops in Korea.However, for us the most memorable was the memorial to the Sewol ferry victims where 250 students died in a tragic ferry accident. The memorial shows photos of the students and allows donations too."
Cold during winter,Wind blowing will make your face frozen when walking in this square. King Sejong's underground memorial/museum can be your savior to escape the winter cold. Nice to walk in this square until you reach Gyeongbokgung Palace.
Impressive statue and museum,"Visited Gwanghwamun Square to take photos of the King Sejong statue. When I arrived at the statue, I found that there's a museum dedicated to the king down under the statue. Admission into the museum is free and there's no crowd at all. Worth visiting."
impressive statue of King Sejong centred the popular square,we had to line up to take photos of the statue of King Sejong which is 6.2 meter high. we also visited the museum dedicated to honor him near this statue. must see. 
G Square,This square is in front of G Place and not to be missed as it has huge statues of two prominent people who shaped South Korea and a underground museum. One can spend a few hours here during early morning and during evening go around this square which a water fountain and plants blooming with flowers of various colors on the side path.This square is also used for various cultural and political activities as adjacent to this square there is a row of foreign embassies.The day of our visit a meeting between the North and South korea was scheduled and there were many groups which were celebrating as a mark of this historic occasion. We were served local delicacies and sweets and we all danced with them and participated in their prayer.The G square houses huge bronze status of King Sejong who is believed to have consolidated the Joseon Dynasty and also the founder of Korean alphabet. There is also a bronze status of the 16th Century Japan-Korean war hero Admiral Yi Sun Sin in a standing posture holding a sword. In front of this status is a water fountain having 23 jets symbolizing the 23 battles he fought.There is also an underground Musuem built in the memory of this King & the Admiral.
It's the KING,Part of the beautiful boulevard that leads to the Palace. Enjoy a leisurely walk past reminders of Korea's history.King Sejong who brought the Korean script to life.
A bit commercial but fun,"There are often markets on the square and the views of the palace are great, the square is also very centrally located and surrounded by interesting buildings."
"Gwanghwamun Square, Korean history in Seoul ","Gwanghwamun Square is locates in the center of Seoul, the 2 major attractions are: 1- the statue of King Sejong (15th century). 2- the Gwanghwamun was constructed as the main gate to Gyeongbokgung Palace, the most important royal palace during the Joseon Dynasty in Korea. It worth visiting to learn something about the Korean history. "
A weekend of activities around the Gwanghwamun Square,"The Gwanghwamun Square is a large, long, thin, traffic free area which extends down from the Gwanghwamun Gate to the statue of Admiral Yi Sun-sin of the Joseon Dynasty. Apparently it is a protest free zone. On the weekend that I stayed in Seoul the whole area was taken over by many small, tent like stalls with groups, mainly of school kids & young people in a massive arts and crafts event. I liked the fact that at least two locations on the square (it's more like a long thin stretch of land between two large thoroughfares), they had built stages and people were performing different forms of music and dance. I sat around for quite some time in the warm October sun enjoying free entertainment on both the Saturday and Sunday afternoons. In addition to the imposing statue of the Admiral there was also one of King Sejong the Great of Joseon who created and introduced ""Hangul"", the native phonetic writing system for the Korean language.Nearby you have the City Hall, the Cheonggyecheon stream and, of course the whole Gyeongbokgung Palace complex. And the well ""fortified"" USA embassy is close by as witnessed by the fairly significant police presence."
Large Square!,"Located in front of Gwanghwamun Gate, so that was nice! The fountains and statues were good to see, happy I went!"
Historical square with an almost deserted museum down under!,"I think most tourist would only take pictures with or of King Sejeong and thing surrounding it and not go to their museum. The museum btw is free entrance so if you want to take a deeper look on your travel, you must go there. There aren't a lot of people inside and there are a lot of things you can learn from the place. Anyway, I do love how this place is just near the Gwanghwamun gate and when you take your pics, you have it as you background. This place is definitely a must and it's also near Cheonggyecheon stream."
Lovely square,"Gwanghwamun Square leads to Gwanghwamun Gate - another attraction nearby but for us the entire square was worth doing. From the fountains to the statues and sculptures, not to mention just watching things go by. We enjoyed our time here."
Huge open plaza ,"This is a big plaza in front of the Gyeonbokgong. There is a huge statue of King Sejong, who invented the Korean alphabets. "
A strange square,"Gwanghwamun is not really a square but a large rectangle in the center of Seoul, directy in front of Gyeonbokgung Palace. There are two famous statues in the middle of the square which divides the highway in two. Many tall buildings are on each side of the street."
Large public square in the centre of Seoul,"I much preferred our recent visit to Gwanghwamun Square than in the past, it was full of atmosphere with a local community fair in progress as well as a large memorial to a recent disaster in Korean to view and ponder, it certainly was a busy public square. Also there are two fabulous statues of great Korean people, Admiral Yi Sun-Shin and King Sejong who have left their mark on Korean society and culture, check out the fun water fountain, most likely enjoyed more in warmer months. At the far end of the square, away of from the business centre, is Bukaksan Mountain in the distance with Gyeongbokgung Palace in the foreground. There is no shade on the square so sun protection is required and recommend a good pair of walking shoes for an enjoyable day out in Seoul."
"Great statute of a great man, good spot to take pictures",Great statue of one of the most important man in the history of Korea. He invented the Korean script to replace Chinese characters. Very spacious to walk around and take pictures.
Large square leading on from Geongbokgung ,When we were there this year the square was set up for viewing of World Cup matches so there were many tents round the statue of King Sejong the most revered monarch in Korean history who created the Hangul. We had a nice wander around and saw the statue of Admiral Yi where there was a mountain. There was a moving memorial exhibition about the Sewol ferry disaster where bodies of a number of people have still not been found and families are still waiting for an investigation to be done and those responsible held to account. The square is really impressive esp as you walk towards Gyeongbokgung and the mountains behind it. A must visit site when in Seoul - easily accessible to Cheonggyecheon and other sights. 
King Sejong the Great,Commemorating the King who was credited of creating the Korean words as we know today. There’s an entrance to the basement where a small museum is located - depicting the various technological advancement and of course the founding of Korean language which is associated with this King. English commentary is provided. 
Nice place ,Nice place to walk around and see thing a lot people here they hangout and do a lot of different thing ! A lot a shop and coffee shop also!! Beautiful view of the mountains too and very clean!!! And very safe!! I will be there in June 5 2018 
"Beautiful, huge and festival like!",It looks like a mini festival in here with so many small shops and vendors around. Though it might be a little expensive to buy items from here. The square in itself gives a good feeling if the weather is good. Recommend spending an hour walking around the place. I got a paper engraved in Korean with a popular saying which was pretty cool as well.
Nice historical place,"Gwanghwamun square located so close to Gyeongbokgung palace, just across the street. Nice place to stroll around."
Nice to see,This area in the front of the Gyeongbokgung palace is a very nice place to be. It is a great area which give you several connections to other nice places. The big staties remind to the history of Korea. You can free walk in the middle of this grand street
"Good Location , Historical leaning place.","Gwanghwamun Square's located in front of Gyeongbok Palace and connected to Cheonggye Square. At the square had King Sejeong Statue and at the back of the statue is The Story of King Sejong (세종이야기). Moreover, its also had a statue of General Yi Sun-Shin, who had victories against the Japanese navy. And now the square had located Sewon's victims recapture tents."
Impressive square celebrating historical figures,"It was a very impressive square. The area was huge and there was Gyeongbokgung Palace and Bukhansan National Park in the background. The square contained imposing statues of Admiral Yi Sun-sin, a military leader and King Sejong the Great of Joseon, the creator of the Korean alphabet. As we walked towards the statues we passed a memorial for the victims of the 2014 MV Sewol ferry disaster, most of whom were students. There was a tent set up with information and it seemed that the families of the victims were still searching for answers. It really pulled at the heart strings."
Huge square with rich history,It is a huge square with lot of rich history especially on the King who created Hangeul. It also shows the different things that he has founded or created.
Beautiful city square,This city square highlights the best of Seoul. A touch of history at one end mixed with the modern day hi tech world. As you walk from the LED screen billboards towards the Palace grounds. You can see many historical statues and city buildings. Try to get up to the palace gates prior to 10am to see the changing of the guard ceremony.
A Tourist Square,"Take a picture of the famous statue on this square. and a very near to the Gyeongbokgung Palace. On the weekend, there so many crowd and people walking in this square. If you need to take a good, quite picture. try in the early morning 7-8am. Sometimes this square has a lot of demo and people marching to protest or make some campaign related with government or organization/activist."
Beautiful place,Good place to enjoy the view. Feels like history meets present in there. They always have any organizational activity there.
Go early in the morning,"Be there before 8am to avoid the crowd, it is different to walk in a wide street without anyone around you. Great opportunity for photograph. Enter the palace and watch guard changing shift at 10am."
The Square in front of the Palace,"My friend and I walked from our place going to Gyeongbokgung Palace, before arriving you will pass by first at this beautiful and historical square. The square is heavily guarded. The statue of King Sejong the Great is located in the middle of the square. For us, we felt it was an additional free treat, who did not expect to pass by in this place before reaching the palace. This site offer another glimpse of the colorful history of South Korea. The statue is really huge and attract tourists. Worth for photo opportunity."
big statue of Great King Sejong (Sejong DaeHwang),a park or square located in front of gyeongbok gung (gwanghwamun - gwanghwa gate).a big statue of Korean Great King Sejong who establish Korean Letter (hangeul).a place to relax and refresh in the middle of crowd Seoul. outdoor
Click and You're Done,"So this was right by our hotel and we would pass it everyday. Maybe I'm missing some of the history on it ... in fact, I'm sure I am. However, it's a statue. You look at it. Click a picture of it or a picture of you with it and head to the palace. "
the point where we start the ancient tour,"big statue in the middle of the road, in line with the Gwanghwamun gate, gyongbokgung palace & national folk museum"
A wonderful testament to a great Leadrer,Most statues are just that....a statue. As a photographer I took it as a bit of a challenge to get a good photo. Just down the street from the Gwanghwamun Gate of the Palace. A quick easy walk and you are there. Another spot for locals and the selfie craze!!
fair visit,"it is like a must-see but i won't be that WOW. but the square is quite big and you may see a prison-like building there, which is the US embassy... it is a quite bizarre view"
"Amazing view, nice spot","We visited this place on our way to Gyeongbokgung. We took exit 9 from Gwanghwamun Station. We were so amazed to see to the King Sejong statue with mountain and palace. It felt so huge. Under this area, there is a museum about King Sejong and all his efforts to invent hangeul. "
Nice area for a visit,"Large outdoor area nice for a walk, specially when there are exhibitions or markets like food festival are there. You can enjoy the walk while trying different foods and chat to nice Korean people."
"Great views and monuments, but very busy","At the bottom of the square you get a great view down the 2 statues and to the palace at the end. In the sun these make a great picture and a pleasant walk, though it is deceivingly longer than it looks.Once thing to note is that it's always very busy here with loads of tourists, and the streets can be a nightmare to cross with waiting almost 10 minutes sometimes due to the huge amount of traffic and irregular traffic light changes.A must see"
A place to go after the palace,"This is the place to go after you are done with Gyeongbukgung Palace. There, you'll find a statue of King Sejong the most venerated king of Korea and, further down, a statue of Admiral Yi Sunshin, a naval commander noted for his victories against foreign invaders. A good place to stretch after being in the palace crowds."
Part of your palace visit,"Take the time to walk down this boulevard as part of your palace visit. Nice and wide, and connects you to Insa-dong and other nearby attractions."
Nice walk,"It was snowing when I visited Gwanghwamun Square, so it was really pretty, we dived in to the starbucks which has 3 floors and gives a view of the whole square. Near the government buildings tends to be peaceful protests and banners "
Seoul's landmark square..,"C ( 17.12.06 ) This square is Seoul's landmark, and many assembly is held. I think there is starting point for Seoul tour. Though there was not many things to enjoy, many attraction is located near this area. And there is historic place about Korea democracy."
Nice to walk by,It is a nice square to walk to the Gyeongbokgung Palace and Gwanghwamun Gate. Make sure to check out the US embassy to the right
Hail the King,The statue of the great king Sejong. The square are huge. It is give you direct access towards the Gwanghwamun Gate. It is a perfect place to give yourself a walk around and admire the beauty of the the other statue located in the site. definitely a must see place when you visiting South Korea.
Great View!,This square has a great view of two statues and a palace. The square includes the statue of Admiral Yi Sun-Sin in front of statue King Sejong the Great in front of Gyeongbokgung Palace in Seoul. It’s definitely a must see when visiting Seoul. 
Visit Seoul,Seoul was so much more fun than I imagined. I love seeing the Korean culture and love the city of Seoul. I will go back to visit. Loved the square and a random festival was going on while we passed through. The palace on the end of the square was amazing! I was surprised Seoul was so clean and modern. 
Big square,"Gwanghwamun Square is a lovely square that was opened in 2009. It is located across from the Gwanghwamun Gate to the Sejongno Sageori intersection. The Royal administrative buildings known commonly as Yukjo-geori (translated to Street of six ministries) are located here. The square is divided into six sections. Towards the centre are two statues. The first is the bronze statue of King Sejong The Great. The second is the statue of Admiral Yi Sun-sin who was a naval commander during the Japanese invasion in the late sixteenth century. On either side of the square is the Waterway of History. There is also a fountain. In front of the statue of King Sejong is a sundial, a rain gauge and a celestial globe – all invented by him.There is a gallery nearby which houses the exhibits of the King."
Ordinary but...,This is just an ordinary square right in front of Gyeongbokgung and Gwanghwamun but do watch out for activities and festivals held in this area. We were lucky to have witnessed the Arirang festival with modern dances and traditional songs played.
Take a local,"Viewing this square is more about the people and the politics that the statues in the square. Whilst the statues themselves might be of interest to a historian, around the square you will see people protesting and campaigning for various things. It's worth taking a local who will tell you what's going on with the current state of (very interesting) affairs in South Korea and it's relation with the rest of the world."
Nice,"The square contain many statures, museums and many restaurants and coffee shops. End of the street there is the gate leading to the palace. "
Just a square,"Gwanghwamun square is in front of the Gyeongbokgung Palace. If you visit the palace, you will see the square. Otherwise there is no need to just come to see it.During our stay, there are some activities in this area: booths for remembering the victims of the ferry accident, concert, choir performance and protests. Since English is not always used by Korean, most of the time we had no clue of the nature of the events."
Nice square telling some of Korean History,Interesting place with statues of the main king and most importan admiral who changed Korean History centuries ago
Eventful,"It's a spot you must cross in order to get to a palace site...and more often than not one can find some event or festival at this location, anything from a farmer's market to a festival. "
Not the best attraction in the area.,The concrete median features statues of a king and a general. Protesters usually surround them. These are something to take in on your way to the palace or maybe Insadong. 
Nice place,It is a very scenic place and popular with tourists. Around this area you can find many shops. The place can be easily reached using subway. 
A popular square for events,"We visited here after visiting Gyeongbokgung palace. The police were having come sort of exhibition here. Lots of tourists here. There was even a stall where you could rent korean costumes. You can find statues of Admiral Yi Sunshin and King Sejong here. Lots of young people hanging around, even on a hot sunny day. The square is free to visit."
A 'Must See' of Seoul.,"If you haven't stood in Gwanghwamun Square then you haven't really been to Seoul! Surrounded by Deoksugung, Seoul City Hall, Gyeongbok Palace, Cheonggyecheon Stream and King Sejong the Square IS Seoul! The sights and sounds immerse you in this amazing city."
Discovered by Accident - Lovely!,"This is a nice attraction if you're interested in walking from the Gyeongbokgung Palace down towards City Hall or other city attractions. It's a beautiful space to see some monuments, mini festivals, all with the mountains in the background."
Manumental,"It is in the city center, big, spacious, behind you will see Gyeongbokgung Palace and Bukaksan Mountain, of course if it is not rainy day."
convenient,"There are various ways to get to this place. The nearest would be Gwanghwamun Station (Seoul Subway Line 5), Exit 1, 2 & 8. It is just opposite Gyeongbokgung and near one part of the Cheonggyecheon stream so you can cover a few places within a day. There's also a King Sejong museum which I didn't get to visit due to the timing. There's a Sunday flea market (information accurate as of 2016) at the square too, can check it out if you pop by on a Sunday. "
Great place to visit,The historical King Sejong museum is a great place to visit and it's free! Good cultural experience for foreigners as well as locals.
Historic ,"Human centered space that harmonized the beautiful scenery of Gyeongbokgung Palace and Bukaksan Mountain located at the center of Sejong-ro which connects Gwanghwamum Gate and Cheonggye Square. The Statue of King Sejong the Great, known for creating the Korean alphabet Hangul and Admiral Yi Sun-shin. They are two of the most influential people in Korean history. Easily accessible by several Subway Metro. Take Metro Subway Line 5 to Gwanghwamum Station Exit 1, 2 and 8, or take Subway Line 3 (Orange Line) to Gyeongbokgung Station Exit 6 and 7. "
Do not forget the museum under the statue. It is free and very educational.,Not everything is as at seems. The statue is only a top of the iceberg. Under the statue is entrance to a large museum area that I recommend visiting. It is very interesting to read about King Sejong and also to learn about the battles at sea with the Japanese navy in ancient times. Highly recommend it.
A bit of history,The great statues tell some history of Korea and are an impressive site to see. But there are also still the people demanding the truth about the Seawol accident.
Hard to miss!!,This is just outside the Gyeonbokgung Palace. The monuments are really nice. If you're lucky you will see a flea market where at one stall Hanbok is sold. So rather rent why not buy the entire get up. That would be a nice souvenir!! 
Definitely worth spending your time here,Definitely worth spending your time here because:1. It is free of charge - great for budget travellers2. Excellent photo opportunities3. Gwanghwamun Gate and the Statues of King Sejong and Admiral Yi Sun-shin are located here4. There is an underground museum about King Sejong and Admiral Yi (unfortunately I didn't get to visit as I was around before opening hours) - great for history buffs
lovely,nice clean pleasant convenient easily accessible interesting nice surroundings definitely a must see
The unofficial heart of South Korea,"Absolutely stunning place that is framed by the mountains on one side and the hustle and bustle of the city on the other side. Making it a great place to take photos and also view the many museums and local eateries that are located on the peripheries of the square. On weekends you see a number of families and people enjoying this place, doing yoga or even praying I.e. Buddhist locals."
Visit Gwanghwamun Square,"This place is in frotn of the Gate of Gyeongbokgung Palace. You must cross the street adn walk to the park until u find the written I SEOUL U. The park is locatet in front of US Embassy.You can take a pict and if you continue your jeourney you will find Museum of Hangeul (?). Hangeul is created by King Jaeson. So this museum can tell all of it.If you decide to coontinue the park, you will see the Statue of King Sejong. I walked until the end of Gwanghwamun Square and turn left to Cheongyecheon Stream. You can take a pict or continue your walk to Subway City Hall Station."
Photo ops!,"It's one of the good places to take photos at in the city. Especially to budget travelers, no entrance fees needed. "
Be sure to visit Gwanghwamun Square,"A few minutes walk you can see the Statue of King Sejong the Great and is located in Gwanghwamun Square, very close to Gyeongbokgung Palace. King Sejong invented the Korean Alphabet (한글)"
Statue of a King on the way to big palace in Seoul.,You can see the square and walk along it when you exit the subway station on the way to the big palace.
Photo Spot ONLY,"Near one of the famous palace and the gate, so might as well visit this place to take photos. However that's about it. Nothing more."
2 Femous persons in Korean History are here!!,"I walked from city hall heading North then found the 1st person is Admiral, Yi Sun Shin( I saw movie about him before I came here). Keep heading North, The 2nd person is King Sejong. We found history of them in Memorial of War Museum (free of charge)."
Heart of the city,"As it is the heart of the Seoul City, various of events took place in the plaza. If you are interested in what is happening in Korea or Seoul, come to this place in the weekend as several events took place in different part of the city when I was visiting on Saturday afternoon. It is a good chance to understand some current issue in Korea and fun to see how Korean participate in the social issue."
Just a pass by location before visiting the Palace,Just a huge square with some historical statues. A pass by location before visiting the Palace. Note that at the east side there's the US Embassy with heavy security.
Get to know Korea,"It's just a big open square but you get to see statues of significant leaders from historical Korea and have a good view of Gwanghwamum. It is a central place with other shopping places, attractions and museums around."
Massive Square - some good photo ops,"Just for the Square it might not be worth a visit, except there are some special happenings on the square. Or when there is special illumination at night.But if you link it with your visit to the Palace and / or Insadong then it's surely worth a look.It's a really massive Square. With the statue of the Admiral Yi Sun-sin a bit to the south and the Statue of King Sejong sitting prominently in the middle of the square, greeting all the visitors. Talking about visitors: There were surprisingly few on the weekday afternoon. Which was good for the photos. And there are quite some photo ops, especially with the King Statue and / or the Palace in the back.Underneath the Square there is a small exhibition hall and museum about the two historical figures depicted the statues.And on the east side there's also the US Embassy with massive security.So, in the end it's just a square, there's not much to do. But come have a look anyways before or after visiting the Palace.Wanna know more about me and my trips? Check my profile."
Experiences - Gwanghwamun square,"Loved the walking field and a lovely fountain family are playing together. And, nice two statues including the history. "
must see attraction for the first time visit Seoul,"Gwanghwamun Gate seems to be the main and largest gate of Gyeongbokgung Palace, one of five palaces those are must-see spots for your first visit in Seoul. we walked along the Centre stream, then reached Gwanghwamun square. there was a flee market in the square which opened in the weekend only. we also visited an underground museum of a Korean King (not remember the name). the entrance of museum right in the backside of the King's statue. After visiting the underground museum we moved forward to the Gyeongbokgung Palace. it was so crowded as so many tourists embarked from the tour buses. we therefore just wandering around and taking photos from outside of the palace. There is also an admission fee, but i am not quite sure how much it is."
Happening on Sunday,Kids wondering and running around playing the water in front of the general statue. Good for family sightseeing in the middle of the town. 
Nice for phot shot!,A must visit area of Seoul for taking a nice photo with the palace as a background. The square is just right at the front of the palace.
Statues and city view,"Very interesting square near Palace. Almost like a driveway leading there. Great vantage point for taking in the surrounding buildings like the Arts center, US Embassy and Contemporary History Museum. Very busy the day I visited with open market and activities related to 5.18."
Interesting,Interesting but not a must. When you walk around the palaces walk to the square. The king is waiting patiently for you. 
great way to the palace,Beautiful avenue that leads into the palace. The statues are great and impressive during day as well as at night when all is lighted up nicely.
beautiful place,"this is a beautiful place and so peaceful, this place are in the middle of town, easy to accessI'll visit this place again if I'm in Seoul"
Memorial to Sewol ferry victims,There is currently a memorial to the 250 student victims of the Sewol ferry disaster. Photos of the 10 classes taken 12 months before the tragedy.
great place,this place is near to the presidential residence so this place must be in your list if you are travelling Seoul.
The sculpture is great!,It's a nice square but busy with traffic around it. The sculpture was really cool and there was an event going on so there was a lot going on whilst we were there.
Historically significant,This statue is in the middle of a busy street. The giant square in the photograph doesn't really exist. There is a wide median in the middle of a busy street and the dirt area around/behind it seems to be permanently occupied by protesters and vendors since it's almost directly across the street from the American embassy. Having said that the statue is of the last and what Korean's believe greatest King Korea has ever had. Note that he's carrying a book not a sword. 
Central square,A very picturesque place. Suitable for family walks. Thought it's very large it doesn't press on your like whole-gray Tiananmen in Beijing.
Center of Activities,"Not sure about weekdays but on the weekend (both Saturday and Sunday) we were there, it was the hub of local activities from which one gets to see local life. On the Saturday evening we visited there was another THAAD demonstration and the northern end of the square were flanked by what seemed like more than 100 police buses. The two boulevards on either side of the square we closed to traffic. When it ended with a parade, the police were lining the streets and the whole event concluded peacefully. At the southern end, there were booths showing displays of a ferry disaster and people calling for action. In between the statue of the great King Sejong looks south and below that is the museum to his honor - a great place to visit and understand why the Koreans revere this king.On Sunday morning, there were lots of activities in the square. To name a few, there was a play with the actors and actresses dressed in traditional garb, there was a free calligraphy event where one can choose a proverb or saying from a book and have it written out on rice paper in Korean by one of the calligraphers, there was a demonstration against environmentally dirty air, there were booths with craft activities for children and adults.Combine your visit to the Gyeongbokgung Palace and other attractions and this square on a weekend and your experience is all the more complete."
Active city centre - lots on!,"There is always something going on in the square. We discovered a museum underneath this statue of King Sejong the Great - it had a wonderful section on the Hangul writing system and the inventions of King Sejong. Another time when we came there were memorial events for the boat disaster. From the square, you can visit museums, the main palace, tours, and it is close to fascinating streets and shopping and eating areas. Activities enough for a day or so!"
It's a lovely walk,"We walked from the palace at one end to the N. Seoul Tower at the other - about an hours walk. Plenty to see (museums, monuments). Plenty we didn't see in the streets and roads that go off at a tangent - you'd need a months stay to investigate them all."
Must see if you love Korean History!!,"I had to see these statues because I love Korean History and the Korean Language. It was very open and beautiful! You have a great view of modern and traditional Korea. You can look out and have a thought like ""Wow, so this is really Seoul, huh?"" They also have fountains so your kids could play in it!! Also, make sure to check out the underground museum where you can learn all about king Sejong. It has lots of fun things including games for the kids."
Easy place to get a picture ,Most people will come to the square in order to get to the palace. It's a nice area to get a pic of the statue and to have the palace in the background. 
Two Iconic Statues,You can find two iconic statue here in Gwanghwamun Square. Underground Museum regarding the history of the two iconic statues is a must visit for me. Very well-designed and informative.
Nice view,If you are heading to the national palace museum this is a nice stop. There's an underground museum that don't take long to check. Worth the visit 
Big Statue,Take a Picture in here is a must and near from Gwanghwamun Gate and Gyeongbokgung palace too. In here many people sell food too so you will not hungry in here :D
Majestic,"Huge and beautiful square. It was a little ""busy"" when I got there at 8:30am on a Sunday. Seoul Marathon was on and there were also protestors camping out at the square."
Impressive Square,"The square itself is very impressive considering its sheer size. However in winter, when there are no flowers the square looks a little desolate. However it provides a stunning view on Gwanghwamun Gate"
Interesting Place,If you want to know more about King Sejong this is the place that you must visit. The museum's entrance can be found at the base of Sejong's chair. You'll learn more about the Korean language and its origin.
Must see when you visit Seoul,"Near subway and just walking distance to Gyeongbokgung Palace, here you will find the statues of King Sejong and Admiral Yi. I was not able to roam much though since there were barricades and some people protesting within the area."
The historical place of democracy,"It has been so important place for Korean politics and democracy, people gather here to share their opinions and to seek justice. This place is also facing one of the famous attractions Gyeongbokgung Palace so here's the place where you can see current Korea but also the past."
Seoul Landmark,"This square is right in front of Gwanghwamun, the main gate of Gyeongbokgung. Statues of Admiral Yi Sunshin and King Sejong, two of the most respected historical figures in Korea.Definitely one of the popular tourist attraction spots. Good photo opportunity. After visiting the palace and a few museums in the same area, definitely check out this square. Subway Line 5, Gwanghwamum Station, Exit 2 or Subway Line 3, gyeongbokgung Station, Exit 5"
Interesting stop on a Seoul City Walk,"You've got to hand it to King Sejong for enabling the invention of the Hangul language and script. Being phonetically based language one can learn to read in matter of few hours. He got most of the phonetics right but since Korean came into the modern age phonetics characters for ""F"" and ""R"" sounds are missing. The Stature of King Sejong is located on a centre strip in one of the biggest roads in Seoul. Its a worthwhile stop on a walking tour around downtown Seoul. "
A Cool Place to See,"A cool place to see if you're in the area. There were protestors in the area, which was interesting. "
Many police,Many police in here. A large square near gyeongbokgung palace. So u can go there with the same time. 
Too many policemen around- there are all in our photos,Easy access from the subway. Maybe we came at a wrong time(we saw demonstration posters near the Jeneral's statue). The policemen were everywhere. Couldn't get a single photo of the King without them in..
Historic place,"This is a large square. Walking in is a very good entertainment. Many events happen there, including a big popular manifestation against government. At the end of this square you can reach the Gwanghwamun gate and palace. "
I was there after going to Kyobo Bookstore,I went to Gwanghwamun by subway and was at the Gwanghwamun Square after visiting Kyobo Bookstore. Worth the time going because the Gwanghwamun Gate was just close by.
Secret entrance,"There is a secret entrance behind King Sejong's statue where you can go to the Story of Sejong, a museum about the greatness of King Sejong. You can also learn to write your name in Hangeul at the museum. The Hangeul Writing station is near the 4D theatre of the naval battle of Admiral Yi Su-Shin"
massive statue of King Sejong,"it's on the busy main street you cannot miss. The King (1397-1450) was the 4th king of the Joseon dynasty. His visionary concerns were rooted in Neo-Confucian principles of benevolence, pursuit of knowledge, and improvement of society. This led to many scientific, technological, artistic and administrative innovations but none as singularly revolutionary as the invention of the Korean alphabet, which would liberate the written word from nobility down to the masses.Across the street is the U.S. Embassy, just as an FYI.Mount Bugak offers an impressive backdrop."
Beautiful historical area,I went to the Square after going to the Gate. This is a nice place to learn about Korea's history and also see the beautiful statues and the unobscured blue skyline. There are many people moseying about and it's nice to catch bits and pieces of the oral history on top of reading the plaques.
Historical sight,It was worth vising this place as you can see a few statues. The palace is also within walking distance. You can also visit the stream which is nearby.
Historical Statues,The square that places the statues of King Sejong and Admiral Yin Sunshin. Very nice place to walk in the evening while enjoying the evening skyline views. Also walking distance to Cheonggyecheon stream.Stop at Gwanghamun station if you are travelling by train. 
Good place to learn about South Korea history,"We went down to the museum and there were stories of their king. Interesting to know and a good place to ""hide"" during cold weather. "
Changing of the guards ,"A great place to start your whole Seoul trip! Get off the subway, walk through the square and then onto the palace. At around 11 there is the changing of the guard! "
A great approach to Gyeongbokgung Palace,Getting off the metro from line 5 Gwangwamun station and walking towards the Palace past the Square has to be the best enterance to the Palace. The mountains as a back drop palace gate middle ground and he statues as foreground. Some great views. Don't forget the underground museum to see the life behind the statues.
Demo? lol,"I go there when the demonstration action happen so I can also saw a lot of board written in Korea. I ain't planning to be here, just drop by because my friend told me to."
Drop by because it's near! ,"After Gyeongbokgung I went off across the street to Gwanghwamun Square. There were a lot of police lined up at the street at that time, so it was interesting in that the old and the new were happening in one place. I've heard from Korean friends that the police were there because of the protests. It was an interesting place, something you can check out after Gyeongbokgung. Nearby, you could go to Kyobo Bookstore or Cheonggyecheon after."
recommended for families and couples,Interesting place with different activities ongoing such as protests. Underground area to learn more about the history of King sejong and the warrior.
A big plaza fronting Gyeongbokgung with two big statues,"Since the US Embassy is beside this place, there were a lot of security details in place. On top of that, at the Gwanghwamun subway end, there were a lot of tents for the protesters against the current Korean President. Not much to see for me on our way to Kyodo Bookstore (the biggest bookstore in Seoul)."
wow...,Korea really take care their history..on this park was guarded when during my visit...take pictures with them also...then play with the water and eat ice-cream..very clean park..also there is a historical museum under the statue..daebak...!!
Gwanghwamun Square,"Not for children. We went, we saw and they said 'that's all?!' Can give this a miss if you have other places to go."
A signature landmark of Seoul,"Just like other Squares in different cities, like Union Square in San Francisco, Tralfalgar Square in London, Red Wall Square in Moscow, Tinanmen Square at Beijing, Gwanghwamun Square stands for Seoul, and gathers most Korean to meet, walk, rest, and socialise in different styles. It's huge, panaromaic and certainly will broaden your eyesight too!"
Visit to cultural Place ,"Besides visiting the 2 huge statues on the ground, there is an underground museum that shows why the King and Admiral deserves such honor. It show case the achievements of King Sejong and how the Admiral fought against the odds against the invasion of Korea by the Japanese warship. It shows how the Korean developed an ""turtle"" warships. "
A taste of local culture,"Learn more about the local culture by visiting this area. Clean area. When I visited, there were protesters in the area but it was ok (peaceful one)."
"Gate, Palace, Plaza and Museum in one place","Gwanghwamun Gate, Gwanghwamun Plaza and Gyeongbukgung Plaza are all in the same area and accessible by foot. Just for photography and a taste of local cultural and old buildings. Do visit the palace museum behind, which is free of charge."
champs elysees of Seoul,"I used to live right behind the opera which is on the same boulevard. great place, but cars tend to make this place a bit noisy. try to go there on sundays or satrudays for special events. Museum below is so so, a bit disneyland... "
Walking with History,When I visited there are police who are ready for the crowds on Saturday and full with tents to commerate with Sewol ferry incident. Great place to walking and know some of the Korean history
learning Korean history,I learned about King Sejong and his contributions as well Admiral Yi Sunshin when I visited this place. You can find the beautiful sundial and the celestial globe. You can also catch the fountain display and this is close to the other tourist spots - Cheonggyecheon Stream and the Gyeongbokgung Palace.
Very near to Insadong,"I walked there from Insadong after visiting Gyeongbokgung Palace. Seoul City is covered with historical attractions. If you can walk, i would strongly suggest you to walk around. Seoul is a very beautiful city. "
Nice place,It is a nice place to walk around when you are in Seoul. You have good views from this place. You can surely visit.
Do your own walking tour,"If you go to Gyeongbukgung Palace, you will see this square in front of the Palace. Instead of seeing the Palace, and then walk the Square, I suggest you print the Gwanghwamun Square Walking Tour from The Seoul Guide website, and approach the Palace from the Square. Do your own free tour of the Square at your own pace.. Take subway to the Gwanghwamun subway, and get out from Exit 5. Start the walking tour from here. It will take you all the way to the gate of the Gyeongbukgung Palace. Because of the ongoing street protests against President Park, our hotel advised against going to Gwanghwamun Square on Saturdays and Sundays when the square is a venue of protest marches. Behind the King Sejong statue is a mini museum - we went on a Monday, and the mini museum was closed. Be careful, cos if you go on a Tuesday, the Gyeongbukgung Palace is closed on Tuesdays. So if you have time constraint, I suggest you just do the walking tour on your own, and then head for the Gyeongbukgung Palace. At the Palace, be in time to join an English tour."
Lots to see,"When I visited, the square was packed with tents to commerate the anniversary of the Suwol ferry incident and it was quite moving to see. I was told by friends that theres always something at the square so definitely worth a visit.Also if course you want to visit the huge statue of King Sejong and the museum underneath, can spend a good hour or two there"
Lots of activities when we were there.,"Visited at the end of October and the was so much going on in the square. Army cadets doing marching drills, concerts, musicians. Very entertaining and all free."
Snap and go at night ,Walked there at night it was really nice. Definitely a great part of Korea's heritage. We spent so much there. Exited the subway station and the we were! Easy to find! 
a great Square you should not missed.,"An all important Tourist spot, the Square is not quite an attraction by itself but visited alongside nearby tourists spots of the Palace, Museum & Hanook village. The close to 20,000 sqm Gwanghwamun Square 광화문광장 is located at the center of Sejong-ro which connects Gwanghwamun Gate to other end at Sejong –ro junction. Two towering statues of Admiral Yi Sun-Shin and Sejong the Great dominates the view. They are both great and influential people in Korean history, greatly admired.From the northern end Gwanghwamun (Gate) is the impressive Gyeongbokgung Palace and the massive mountains behind. the subway Gwanghwamun Station is just nearby .Probably takes up ½ hour of visiting time afterwhich one can proceed to the Korean History museum, the Museum dedicated to king Sejong and Yi Sun Sin, the Sejong performance art centre and Gyeongbokgung Palace are all within walking distance. Shaped more like a rectangle there are normally side walk stalls of Events along the beautifully paved walkway. Wonderful spots to take some great photo along the central walkway, which we did.From here we next drop by the nearby Bukchok Hanok village and Insadong before heading back hotel."
"Must see, because it's there","This leads up to one of the palaces, and it is something you must see, and then you've seen it. I found contemporary Seoul much more compelling than these historical relics, but one can't really skip them, can one?"
A grand central walkway,"When I came here the first time, I only walked along the walkway, looking at the grand statue of King Sejong before continuing on my journey. But the 2nd time, I walked here, I realized that there's actually a mini museum underground with the entrance somewhere near the statue. How did I even missed that during the first visit? Anyway, it seems that in the olden days, the central walkway is a gathering place for citizens who wished to meet the King. P/S: I love the scenic view of the mountain at the back of the palace. It makes you wonder how beautiful the whole area was in ancient time."
Always something going on,"When I visited in October, it was the Seoul Arirang Festival, that took place here. A popular event location, it's worth passing by during your visit, you never know what you stumble upon."
Great Place to Understand Some History of South Korea,"Gwanghwamun Square is a good place to visit, to understand some history of South Korea. You can also take great pictures with the statue. It is also near the Gyeongbokgung Palace, Cheonggyecheon Stream as well as Bukchon Village so you can plan all these places in a single day. It is also accessible via metro (alight at Gwanghwamun station)"
The greatest square ,"It's 555 m length from the Kyeongbok Palace main gate. It's a good experience if you take a walk from edge to edge of the square that you can see the statues of admiral Yi sun-shin & king sejong, national museum of Korean contemporary history, sejong center for the performance arts & many country embassies. Line5 Gwanghwamun Station exit2."
A few steps away from Gyeongbokgung Palace or Cheonggyecheon Stream,Went over to Gwanghwamun Square for a short sight-seeing. There was a fair with stalls selling clothes and food around it during my visit. A good spot for photography. It was great to see historic architectures among tall skyscrapers. A good way to preserve history.
Loved this place,"My hotel was near this area and we took strolls around this area very frequently. I love the atmosphere and the scenery at night is pretty gorgeous. You have Gyeongbukgung at the end of it and both sides are flanked by traffic with tall financial buildings around – it’s pretty surreal and makes for very nice photographs. It’s also a stone’s throw from many eateries/other nice to visit places like Samcheongdong, Seochon and cheonggyecheon stream."
Just a few steps from The great Gyeongbokgung Palace,Surrounded by the modern buildings and in front of gyeongbokgung palace is a plus. Walking down further leads you to Cheonggyecheon Stream. the location is great easy to get to from the subway. Take Subway Line 3 to Gyeongbokgung Station (Exit 6).
You'll wind up here eventually,"Situated near the both important business centers, transport hubs and tourists sites, you'll wind up here eventually. A picture of the statue of King Sejong is a must-do on a tourist's trip to Seoul. The admiral Yi Sunshin makes an appearance, too. You'll traverse this square on your way between Insadong/Jongno and Gyeongbok Palace.The square is decent enough to walk through, although it doesn't offer much for visitors beyond a few photo ops. Be aware of political demonstrations; many of Seoul's big ones happen here."
A MUST SEE site during your visit to Seoul,"My grandparents used to live about a mile away from what's now Gwanghwamun Square so I visit this area for sentimental reasons, but I just love the look and feel of walking down the square (which is more like a hugely long rectangle). Start off from the front of the palace, wave at the US Embassy (how did we score this prime piece of real estate?) and walk towards the King Sejong monument (make a visit to the Hangul museum - entrance at the back of the monument). Then take a picture with the Admiral Yi monument (famous for the turtle ships) before you head down Cheonggyecheon Stream. Walk slowly and look back from time to time for a breathtaking view of the palace and mountain. The only drawback to this place is that it's often a site for festivals and stuff so your view (and pictures) can be marred by white tents or posters. Otherwise, it's a must visit place for any visit (even repeat visits) to Seoul."
Often used for performances and shows :),"Centrally located, nice place to relax and watch the world pass by. Often packed during shows and performances!"
perspective,"A massive space, like many great cities, with a breadth of times an info. Puts city hills, history and palaces into perspective. poignancy of the ferry disaster activist group also. "
Very spacious square just opposite the Changgyeonggung Palace,"A good place to walk around. The square is about the history of the Japanese invasion. There is a big bronze statue of the King too. Do read up the history before you go as it will be more meaningful. Good place for photography. There is also a place to remember the Jeju Island ferry tragedy. The photos of the victims and their stories are displayed and many people especially the locals, their relatives and friends are seen praying inside the makeshift tents. As the square is big it is not crowded."
Interesting area ,Came across the statue on my way to one of the palaces. There's so much to explore in the area. If you love to sightsee this is a good area to start.
The Famous Square of Korea,"This Place is Dedicated to the History of the Japanese Invasion and the Kings memories, the Statue of the King Sejong and Admiral Yi Sun-Sin perfectly located in the Square to honor these individuals."
Rich history and culture!,"All you want to know about Japan naval invasion on Joseon and how Admiral Lee Sun Shin defeated the Japanese naval force. He was so smart and dedicated to his country! Lee Sun SHin Manse! There's even an animated story of his war!Also a lot of info on King Sejong the Great, how he created Hangul, how he supported the invention of a calender and clock and lots more."
impressive,These 2 stature are impressive representation of Korea's past. It was hot and very far to walk from anywhere to get close. It is in front of the palace but still a long hot walk.We were on the the hop on hop off bus which is the best way to see it all for one low price.
a nice square,This square is not a big attraction on its own but in combination with the palace then its ok to visit.i suggest doing this route as a day trip.Gwanghwamun Square - Gyeongbokgung Palace - Bukchok Hanok village - Changeokgung Palace - Insadong - Cheonggyecheon Stream
Lovely big open space,"We saw some beautiful big statues.We would liked to have taken a closer look but there was some sort of demonstration going on and there was riot police everywhere,so we thought it best to leave the area.It was a shame."
Take photos with famous statue here,I spent only a few mins here to have a look at the statues there and took a few photos. Gwanghwamun Square is very near to Gwanghwamun Gate which is the entrance to Gyeongbokgung. The is also a subway station located there which is Gwanghwamun Station. Following is my route for the visit (but this route required a lot of walking):Anguk Subway Station - Bukchon Hanok Village - Blue House - Gyeongbokgung (enter via gate near Blue House) - Gwanghwamun Gate (Guard changing ceremony) - Gwanghwamun Square - Gwanghwamun Subway Station
Lots of local color,"Certainly on weekends,holidays,and fairs this is a great place to see Koreans. People watching at its best"
Famous sqare with famous statues,Statues of Admiral Yi Sun-Shin and King Sejong are a must-see. They are over guarded by the Police and you can understand why as soon as you see them.
OK to spend a bit of time,"This ""new"" square is right in front of the American embassy and just down from the main gate to the palace. It has a few things worth seeing, but don't feel bad if you miss it."
Gate,"Big place with open space. Close to other temples, restaurants, to the US Embassy as well. Cheap admission price too"
Very Clean Open Space,"Whilst in Seoul there was always something happening in this area with swarming people and side walk stalls. It is beautiful paved and features 2 magnificent statues, Sejong The Great and Admiral Yi Sun-Sin. On the northern end is the impressive Gyeongbokgung Palace. From this location it is easy to enter the subway network or simply amble along the wide walkways heading south to City Hall and shopping."
Good sightseeing spot,After a visit to the palace we took a nice walk through the square. There were a few statues and stalls on either side. There are lots of shops and restaurants surrounding the square also.
On The Way To Gyeongbokgung Palace,This is at the exit of Gwanghwamun Station while on the way to Gyeongbokgung Palace. It is a very lively place. 
Impressive statues,"It is interesting to see Gwanghwamun Square in both daylight and at night. The statues are beautiful. It is a great place for a photo opportunity. Otherwise, the square is often used as a venue for events, concerts, and occasionally civil protests. It is worth a 20-30 minute walk to see the statues and admire the city landscape."
Very nice place to visit,It's in the heart of Seoul and close to so many other things. You'll love the great pics you'll get. 
Iconic place in the heart of Seoul ,"Here stands the 2 greatest men in the history of Korea. King Sejong and general Yi Sun Sin. The Korean contemporary history museum, the underground museum dedicated to king Sejong and Yi Sun Sin, the Sejong performance art centre and gyeongbokgung are all around here "
A wide open space in the middle of Seoul,"We stumbled upon this square after leaving Cheonggyecheon and on our way to Gyeongbokgung Palace. This square is very impressive with two major statues. Good history, lots of the explanations in English. It was well worth the time to see this."
"Fantastic place, a must","The first time I visited, there was 3 "" snow and walking up the metro steps and see this status with the palace behind was one of the most wonderful sights you can see. I have visited numerous time since and still enjoy this sight. It is free to walk along. There is another status to view and a decorative water fountain. Travel to City Hall on line 1 & 2"
"well, it's a square","If you go to Gyeongbokgung palace, the possibility of passing by this square is very big because it's right in front of the palace. If you want a picture with the huge King Sejong you shouldn't miss this square."
Lovely ❤️,"Be sure to go here first before going to Gyeongbokgung. Here, you'll find the statues of King Sejong and Admiral Yi, which are only a few distance apart. It's nice to hang out here especially during Summer. The fountains in front of Admiral Yi's statue is relaxing to watch."
A field,The open area where there is two statue here located in front of gyeongbongguk palace. sometimes they held festival here
King Sejong,"Finally I could come here after 3 times came to Seoul If you happen to be going to gyeongbokgung, this place is near so you should take photo here"
meeting place for koeans,"This square is a popular meeting point for Koreans (similar to Seoul Square). The dominant scene in the square is the statue of Sejung the Great who ruled Korea in the 15th century. He was credited with creating the korean language.This is a great photo opportunity, as the statue is situated with a great view of Mount Bugaksan in the background.There is also a statue of Admiral Yi Sun-Shin who was a war hero of the Imjin Wars (Japanese Invasions) between 1592-1598. This statue is situated in front of the water sprinklers, so there are usually many children playing here and cooling off.There is also an alter to the missing of the Sewol Ferry disaster, where persons can pay their respects. At the corner of the square (near to the subway entrance) is a monument in the shape of a Korean Gate that was erected to celebrate the 40th anniversary of Emperor Gojungs enthronement. Gojung took the throne in 1863, at age 11.He was the first emperor of the Korean empire.Admission is free, and this is a must visit for tourists."
"Just as in the TV, but in higher definition~","I'm not a big fan of historical place, this has somehow entertained myself along with my travel mates! "
Just outside Exit 2,This was just outside Exit 2 of the subway line that we took. then we went to the palace and see the changing of the guards.
Cool,Really great area.Lots of sights to see.It was a hot summer day and the sprinklers were on and next to the statues many children gathered in the water to cool off.It was beautiful .
Here for the photos,"The Gwanghwamun Square is a very common place to go for Koreans if there are big events. Tourists usually come here for photos and I am one of them. There's not a lot of people here, managed to take a photo with Sejong Emperor which invented Korean and the other general. I heard that there's a museum around and Gyeongbokgong is right behind the square so you can go visit if you're interested. Otherwise, it's just an iconic square for tourists to take photos. "
A standard square in a busy city,Very accessible square just outside Gwanghwamun gate and Gyeongbokgung that is good for a stroll on your way somewhere else. Connects you to the Changyecheon. Make sure you bring a hat or an umbrella for sunny days.
Busy square leading to tranquil Gyeongbokgung Palace,"Public open space in front of Gyeongbokgung Palace with statues of Admiral Yi Sun-sin King Sejong. Busy location, but peaceful and safe."
A Typical Square - Can be Blazing Hot in Summer - Bring an Umbrella,"The Gwanghwamun metro stop is right in the square (underground) - it's the best way to get to this neighborhood - and it's air-conditioned, the best part! Bring an umbrella to shade yourself from the scorching sun. This was not my favorite square in Seoul - perfectly pleasant, but nothing spectacular."
Basement Museums are more Impressive than Statues of King Sejong & Admiral Yi,"While the statues of King Sejong and Admiral Yi are impressive, you can take the stairway to the underground museums dedicated to both of these icons and you are likely to be even more impressed. Both museums are top notch tributes that explain the importance of both of these figures in Korean history. The cost is free! If you benefited from this review, please click the helpful button."
Clean and accessible!,"A grand type square, the statue of the great man who invented the Korean language. It is clean, safe and accessible to everyone in the area. A stroll in this area is a must for all visitors who have time."
Easily reached by subway,"For anyone who's going to visit Gyeongbukgong Palace, Gwanghwamun Square is a place should be visited. It is located near the palace and a good place to take photographs for those who enjoyed doing photography works. It has historical value as well for those who loves history."
"Don't just walk through, go underneath to the free museum","The square itself is worth the visit, with statues of the King and the Admiral and in sight of Gyeongbokgung Palace (5 minute walk away). Lots of people around, taking pictures, having a coffee, etc. Great views!Highly recommend that you go underground to the free museum/exhibit, which you can get to from the backside of the statue of King Sejong (stairs and elevator available). At the desk they can provide you with a free audio guide and it takes 30-45 minutes to do the whole thing. I learned so much history about Korea, from the development of the alphabet and music to the Imjin war(Japanese aggression in the 1400s) and development of the Navy. We're all history buffs, so we really enjoyed this uncrowded little treasure. "
Great pedestrian friendly open area ,"The scenery is beautiful of this place and you can view the magnificent Gyeongbokgung Palace and the Bukaksan Mountain in the back drop. To enjoy best try to go at a time that you have some day light left and stay till it gets dark as the night view is splendid also. There are huge statues of admiral Yi Sun and King Sejong of the great of Joseon. There is water jets and at night which look even better because of the different light combinations. Along both side of the statues run a waterway which is quite unique and has history written on the stones. The best part of it is that you have plenty of things to see around the square like city hall, the national library etc. "
Lovely square at night,"Lovely square especially at night. Lots of tourists (both group and solo) taking photos and there are multiple good photo spots. I visited it multiple times en-route to Sejong Center, and during one of the trips i saw a protest being staged there. Each time i walk towards this square, i could see visible police presence (generally very young looking police, could be cadets) but they general don't look at us (we obviously look like tourists) - they only paid attention to the protestors"
A great place to walk through near Gyeongbokgung,"I highly recommend walking through this square after visiting Gyeongbokgung Palace since it's a stone's throw away. The square has large statues of King Sejong who created the Hangul writing system and Admiral Yi a Korean military hero. The square also commemorates the people who died in the 2014 Sewol Ferry Disaster. If you're feeling adventurous, you can walk down a bit further to get to Deoksogung Palace."
Beautiful square!,"Impressive square that leads to the Emperors palace, a nice walk through the fountains, the statue of King Sejong and the mountain as background."
Playground,"A nice place to visit on a sunny day. Besides the historical statues and tiles, it is fun to see the children play in the fountains."
Central,"If you are in the area to see other things such as the palaces, museums, or City Hall, definitely stop by to see the two large statues. There are often protests going on in the area, though, so keep that in mind. There is still a memorial (and protest) area set up for those who died in the Sewol Ferry incident."
Impressive statue!,"I would suggest you visit Gwanghwamum square together with the Palace. You can actually see the Gate and Palace from the Statue.For those who knows Korean history and love watching historic dramas, you gotta visit the Square and take a picture with the King! :)There's also another Statue with the General, all lined up in 1 straight line! :)"
Walking distance from City Hall - site of many protests,"Besides the impressive statues in this ""square"" (it is really just a wide median strip along a major street, it seems to be the place where people go to protest. The biggest display I saw was one for the high school students who died in the tragic ferry boat accident a few years ago. "
Very Touristy,Loads of people around but worth a visit. Quite interesting to see these old structure from Korean history and then display of exploitation in modern days and how people are fighting it.
Impressive way of presenting the history,Very huge and beatiful monument. The details of the history were totally in Korean language so must be there with a translator to understand.
Nice for a stroll,"This public space provides great views of the Gyeongbokgung Palace and downtown Seoul on both sides. There was a public demonstration when I visited, which was mostly peaceful so I did not feel unsafe."
Stunning,Close to the hotel and easy to get to on foot; close to all the main attractions as well as the bars and restaurants; plaques on the walls in English to explain the historical significance.
"Huge square, a good starting point for a Seoul visit",This square might be Seoul's version of Tiananmen Square. It is in front of gyeongbukgung palace and it has statues of King Sejong the Great and Admiral Yi-Sun Sin (important figures in Korean history). There is a small museum that tells the stories of these 2 important men. 
Close to many other attractions in Seoul,"We kept passing this place up on our extended trip to Seoul to visit family. I researched what the place was and found out it’s a memorial to King Sejong. Thus I wanted to check it out. The only problem was when we finally got around to visiting it, it was snowing and nearing blizzard type conditions. That was sad because on other occasions, there were many people out talking, eating, dancing, people with protests signs and even Christian groups out singing. This is a cool little section in the middle of Seoul and if you’d like to get a sense of Korean culture and daily life, I’d highly recommend it."
One of my favourite places in Seoul!,"The wide space made me admire the view of the buildings on one side, Gwanghwamun Gate and mountains on the other! Great place to sit down and people watch. "
Great place to people watch and attend free events,"I was here on a sunday afternoon, where market like stalls were setup. Many were selling North Korean items and/or proposing peace with North Korea. Most of the information was in Korean. But, when prodded the stall attendants would try to explain in english. I had coffee from Pyongyang which tasted pretty good. Saw a North Korean group dance which looked more like an Irish Jig expect the participants were in traditional Korean clothing. This place seems to be crime free and there was ample Police presence. Although, a few harmless homeless people hung around. Around here are the famous Seoul tourist spots. Also, closeby there was a Free Korean Drum event going on. The music and singing could give some of the rock groups a run for their money. Seems like a good place to bring kids and involve them in activities. Easily, accessible by public transport."
Landmark,A visit to the square can be combined with the other attractions in the area. Dont forget to see the museum below the monument. Small museum but interesting and free.
The huge statue of King Sejong,Love the architecture surrounding the area and you can take a photo with the great King Sejong's humongous statue. 
The heart of Korea,A must see - the square is on the old road to the palace. There is an interesting protest based there pushing for questions about the tragedy of the MV Sewol and the 300 odd lives lost. 
Tourist attraction,"The seoul city tour bus starts from here. Seating place available for visitors to sit and view the place. We also was the night lantern festival during our visit on 7th May'16. The lantern festival passes and travels from here to another nearby station. Chairs are place on either side of the road to view the procession. Very lively procession with lot of music, characters of dragon, cartoons, creatures. Good for all ages"
majestic,It was a rainy day but i managed to get there.This is one of the must see of Tokyo.Like the trafalgra square of UK. Lots of people taking pictures .Great walking area. Great story of King Sejong and his contribution to Korea
Good place to begin for tourists,"This large square is just outside leading to the Gyeongbokgung Palace (main royal palace). It has embassies around it and I am also told, the setting for a dramatic scene Iris drama. It is large enough not to be crowded and it is a nice walk smack the middle of the city with statues of King Sejong and Admiral Kim Yu Shin. This place is also connected to 2 subway stations so it is easily accessible. You can also check it out at night for a different vibe. When I was there, there was also an exhibit of the Sewol Ferry Accident with pictures of the students found and those still missing. Really sad."
Walk back through time,"Gwanghwamun has a lot of historical significance. Apart from the famous statues of Lee Sun Shin and King Sejong, there's even an underground museum dedicated to King Sejong (entrance behind the statue) where you can learn more about his life and achievements. All along the edges of the square are tiles with historical dates and events etched so you'll really feel like you're taking a walk through time. Right after the square is Gyeongbok Palace, so it's a great place to stop by on your way to the palace. "
Korea's past meets Korea's present,"I love this place. You can see Mt.Bugak behind Kyungbok palace which is surrounded by modern sky scrapers. There is so much going on. It is a vibrant,fun place one must visit. It is not so commercialized as some other big cities. It is packed with culture, history, and fun!"
Not To Miss When In Seoul,"Located downtown Seoul, you cannot miss this landmark when you are going to the Royal Palace. Nice to play with the fountain when you're out in broad daylight. To get there, take Seoul subway line 1 or line 2 and alight at City Hall Station Exit 3 or Line 3 and alight at Gyeongbukgung Station exit 6 & 7."
OKish,"Nothing amazing on its own but close to the Palace gate so since you'll be in the area anyway, have a look"
Nice for Late Afternoon Stroll,"A stroll from the palace is a must. Further down, there is the upper part of the Water Reclamation Centers that was turned into eco-friendly park."
"Cool statue, underground museum",This area is nice and picturesque. What's interesting is there is an underground museum in this area. 
One of the best places in Seoul for history junkies like me,"Here you can find two statues that greatly influenced Korean history--King Sejong (created the Korean alphabet or mainly known as 한글) and not far from him is the statue of Admiral Yi Sunshin (defeated the Japanese fleet).This place is also famous for its beauty after dark with the dramatically and colorfully illuminated statues.There is also a museum/gallery located at the back of King Sejong's statue (The Story of King Sejong and Waterway of History).Gyeongbokgung Palace is easily spotted here--it has a nice silhouette that lies against the Bukaksan Mountain.Sometimes, exhibits and events are held around this place. It is a good place for strolling as well."
The place for pictures and a nice stroll,"This area is opposite of Gyeongbuk palace and you drop by before or after your visit to the palace. I would say taking picture of the Gwanghwamun gate from the square is recommended as you can capture the whole gate. The square itself is not huge but you have statues of King Sejong and the scientific inventions from his era as well as Admiral Yi Sun Shin on the other end of the square. Under King Sejong's statue, there is a small area which you can enter to learn more about him. There are also flowers in the middle which looks beautiful especially during the spring. On certain days, there are flea markets, concerts and other entertainments around the area. There is also a small booth for foreigners to try to put hanbok (traditional Korean attire) near the exit to enter the subway station (which is right behind Admiral Yi Sun Shin). You can park somewhere around the area or using the palace's parking area and drop by the square for a walk."
Beautiful views of Gyeongbokgung Palace and the mountains,You can't miss Gwanghwamun Square on your way to Gyeongbokgung Palace. Great place to take pictures of the palace and the mountains behind.
Nice place for a stroll,We took a nice stroll in Gwanghwamun Square on our way to Gyeongbokgung. It was quite a scenery with the Bukaksan Mountain as your background.
Peaceful Long Stroll,"Gwanghwamun Square is a good place to have a slow stroll. Once you exit Gyeongbokgung Palace, cross the road and you can start the peaceful walk all the way to Cheonggye Stream.My way of stroll:1. Along the square at the side you will see the marble floor embedded the names of the Kings that once ruled Korea.2. Statue of King Sejong the Great, visit underground museum dedicated to the life and times of King Sejong, exhibition hall of Admiral Yi Sun-shin & souvenir shop (Tip: free Hangul writing for foreign visitor). This also connected to Gwanghwamun Subway Station3. Admiral Yi Sun-shin Fountain along the square, children will enjoy it4. Cheonggye Stream (Spring Tower) If you have a strong pair of legs, you can go further to ventures all the total of 22 bridges before flowing into the Hangang (River) in Cheonggye Area."
Average landmark square,"Just an average square, with a landmark statue. Sometimes there is concert or activity held here. On the opposite street, there are a lot of cafe to hang around. "
just for photo taking,"nothing spectacular, just photo taking for 'i've been here' sake... but can see gwanghwamun at the background of the statue, quite nice."
Must-visit place in Seoul,"It is cheap, clean and airy. The square is quite big with many events. After getting out Gyeongbokgung, you can go through this Square to the Stream."
Seoul's historical heartbeat with a view,A windy broadstroke of a space which is a great place to meet war and letters in the same square ( in the shape of the two famous statues) and the palace gates beyond and the mountains beyond-er heh heh.
Impressive,The square was alive with activity the day we visited but we were still able to appreciate the layout of the square to take advantage of the palace and mountains beyond creating great depth. Having the many embassies bordering it also gives it an air of importance.
Worth A Photo,There are a lot of people and a lot of stuff happening but none of it is exceptional.The iconic sculpture in the square is worth a photo if only to prove you were there. Worth a half hour of your time.
Impressive sculpture in central location,"This statue is located in central Seoul, close to the palaces, Buddhist temple and shopping. It's on a main drag replete with museums and as well as Angel in Us coffee shop, so a must-see. When I was there in February, there was a temporary homage to the students who drowned in the ferry disaster, rather unusual criticism in this city. "
"Pretty, busy square","This is a busy square, with plenty to see. There's a metro station right underneath, so it's easy to get to. Beneath the square, there are shops too, including a large book store, food outlets and clean toilets.Seoul City Hall and Deoksugung Palace are a short walk from one end of the square; Gyeongbokgung Palace is at the other end of the square.In or immediately adjacent to, the square itself is the 40th Anniversary Monument of Gojong's Enthronement, and statues of Sojung the Great King along with some of the inventions he is responsible for, and Admiral Wi and his ship in which he defeated the Japanese navy. There's a subterranean display of their respective achievements.The United States Embassy is right there too, with a constant, massive police contingent.Right now (March, 2016), the square is hosting the sad Gwanghwamum 416 Family Memorial Alter, mourning those who lost their lives in the April 2014 sinking of the Sewol Ferry. Nine bodies were never recovered. The sinking claimed the lives of 250 high school students on an excursion, eleven teachers, and 43 other members of the public and crew - a total of 304 people. They have a display there, and you can sign a petition calling for an investigation as to how the disaster happened, and for the wreck to be raised to try to find the missing bodies so they can be reunited with their families. Very sad indeed."
Nice walk to the palace,"We walked from city hall station to the palace through here. It quite nice architecture, very Seoul."
Amazing landmark and symbol of Seoul's history.,"This place is in the Downtown Seoul area. All the buildings here are pretty much government buildings. The statues are located in the center of the road and the walking area is pretty long or at least a good distance. If you are in Seoul, I would stop here!I found it really interesting to learn about the history of King Sejong and how he came to create the Korean alphabet. Below the square is a museum about King Sejong. The entrance is just behind the statue of the king."
Love this area so much ,"Gwanghamun is a pearl of Seoul, and I suggest all to visit :-) it's interesting and there are huge buildings all over. Easily my favourite area to walk around and clear my thoughts and look at life around me :-) please don't miss this interesting place "
Nice walk after visitting Gyeongbokgung,"Worth a few minutes walk to meet one of the most important kings of the past of Korea, and the most admired general, able to defeat Japanese fleet with just few ships. "
Need to go here!,This was great you have the American & Korean Embessy on opposite sides of the street. Down underground you have this great museum under this statue.
Nice Square But Action is Around and Below,"This is a great square, and it has the two most famous statues -- King Sejong the Great (inventor of the Hangul alphabet undergirding the high literacy of Koreans) and admiral Yi Sun-shin (commander of Joseon Navy which destroyed the Japanese fleet supporting the Hideyoshi invasion of Korea). Very often there are events in the square and a fountain complex in the southern part that is really fun for kids in the summer. It is often the site of political demonstrations, too, but these are very tame for the most part.The more interesting part of the square are what is around and what is below. What is around include Gyeongbuk Palace (with its displays and its guard changing), the Sejong Cultural Center which has performance events, and good restaurants on the Sejong Cultural Center side. On the U.S. Embassy side is the Museum of Contemporary History which is new and okay. Below the square are two fun museums devoted to Admiral Yi and King Sejong respectively. The Yi museum has a walk-in replica of the famous turtle boat, and there are lots of things for kids to see and do. The King Sejong side is very educational and informative and has some displays on the many design achievements that make use of Hangul."
Nice place to walk,"Outside Gyeongbokgung Palace. Nice place to walk, click some pictures, have a $ drink etc. The street around is very busy. US Embassy is near by."
constantly changing and always interesting,"I enjoy visiting Gwanghwamum square often. There are always lots of people and things to see and do. The ever changing pop up tents, activities, and sights make it a must visit for travelers and locals alike."
Square at the City Center,This is a big square near the city center. Here we can see the big statue of King Sejong who made the Korean Written that still use until now.
Just a statue,Just the statue of Sejong the Great. Not really spectacular but on the way to the Gyeongbokgung palce. So you can take a couple of photos and carry on further.
Proof that you have visit Seoul,You should leave your foot print here even you wearing shoe. Visit it when weather is clear or you will on trouble to look for shelters.
Early evening street preformances.,"Nice square in the heart of Seoul worth a look either when visiting Gyeongbokgung palace or in the evening when there are often street preformances. I have seen acrobatics, drum bands and classical Korean singers around the square from around 1800 (not so many in winter). There are two main statues and it can be a nice way to walk to or from the palace."
a big cemented park,"It was raining when we visited the square, it is a huge park with stoned flooring, no bench for sitting or resting for seniors."
Get a pciture,Huge statue amongst the busy traffic...but a site to see. There was a drum performance going on when I was there...it was nice to hear them in the background....such talent.
Sejong Plaza,"This is an excellent place to go solo, with friends or family. I recommend summer. The you can go wading in the plaza wading pool. Lots of sights to see, and restaurants to check out."
Historical,I went there by Seoul City Tour with my cousin. Pay for 15000 won and you may visit a lot of places of interest. We went during autumn.. Nice place to walk..
Historical Palace,Learn about the dynasty on Korea.Many kings history has been shared in the Museum.Good & recommended for family.Visited twice.
nice walk,"good walk on a good weather towards Gyeongbokgung Palace. Ample space with modern buildings on the both sides. Police were line on side, not sure if it's a daily thing or just for the day."
Square in the center of Seoul,"This is another of most recognizable places in Seoul and it's ""heart"". This is basically big empty square in front of Gwanghwamun Gate and Gyeongbukgung Palace. Easily accessible by subway (you have direct subway exit to Square).Many festivals and events are taking place here - when we were in Seoul at least 3-4 different events were taking place, plus around the square you can find many shopping places, cultural centers, statues of two most important people in Korean history (King Sejong and General Yi Sun-sin) or museums. Also you can for free try out hanboks - traditional Korean dresses. :)"
Nice square in the city,It's great to drop by this place during your trip to Gyeongbokgung. Don't forget the visit the History of King Sejong on the opposite side.
Part of the day trip,Gwanghwamun is easily walked to from Gyeongbuk Palace and is dominated by the golden statue of King Sejong and the statue of Lee Sung Shin at the far end. One of the iconic photo ops of a trip to Seoul
The heart of Seoul,"One of my favorite parts of the city. Not only does it provide a beautiful view of the main palace on nice days, but it's also a very open and spacious area which is nice in such a cramped city like Seoul.There is always a festival or market going on here. The American embassy is located at the square a well.If you would like to try on Korea Hanboks, during the day a tourist stall is set up near the King Sejong statue that allows tourists to take pictures in Hanboks.During the warm months a fountain show can be seen at the square where children can also play in the water throughout the day. The fountains also light up at night time.Also located near by City Hall and the Indsadong area.A must see in Seoul."
Enjoying a Glimpse of Seoul,"If you're visiting Gyeongbokgung (which basically a must visit for travellers coming to Seoul), you must have visited Gwanghwamun because it is right in front of Gyeongbokgung main gate. All you have to do is crossing the street and you are at Gwanghwamun Square! There are some things that you might see in Gwanghwamun. There are a kind of water stream with some Korea's history in it. You may also see Kim Se Jong statue (he is hangul founding father, korean alphabet). The view is quite amazing with mount background. Even it's related much to Korean's history, we can learn quite a bit about it because in Gwanghwamun Square, they presents it in a very nice way!"
Must visit,"The Gwanghwamun Plaza area is a beautiful (and large) plaza in Seoul. You can visit the statues of King Sejong and Admiral Yi Sun-sin, and the museum under Sejong's statue, while on the way to the Gyeongbokgung Palace. The views of the plaza, mountains and palace are great. "
Big square offering nice views,"To visit the Gyeongbokgung Palace you will get first to this long square. It has some big sculptures of remarkable Korean personalities, but its main interest is the good picture opportunities that offers you, with the Palace and the mountains behind. Additionally it makes an ideal spot for the start and finish areas of the Seoul Marathon."
Iconic statue in Seoul,I usually pass by to get to Kyobo library. Nice place to stop by if you are traveling. Several palaces are close from here.
"Great place, good to visit and to see everything around","Near the center of Seoul, this place is very active and has a lot of cultural importance. When we were here, there was an exhibition of all the flags of the countries who fought in the Corean War. Great contrast with the statues."
A nice stop to make before or after your visit to Gyeongbokgung Palace,"Gwanghwamun Square is a large public space situated in the middle of Sejong-ro, just south of Gyeongbokgung Palace . The plaza is 34 metres wide and over 500 meters wide and includes a few interesting things to see. Here you find large scale monuments to beloved King Sejong the Great and Admiral Yi Sun-Sin, both important historical figures in Korean history. The statues are facing the south, providing a nice photo ops in front of Gwanghwamun Gate and the palace in the background. Another interesting attraction which can be accessed from Gwanghwmun Square is the underground 'The Story of King Sejong and The Story of Admiral Yi Sun-Sin'. This is a combined collection of learning displays and information, a very helpful attraction for those who wish to learn more about these two great men. Overall, they have done a nice job with Gwanghwamun Square. History buffs will appreciate the attractions here and others will find it worth a quick stop before or after visits to Gyeongbokgung when spending time in this area of Seoul."
Historical place in the busy city,"Gwanghwamun square is the main attraction place in town. U cannot miss this spot. There's a lot to see here from majestic statue of king sejong, sewol memorial (ferry tragedy), art and culture and more. Take a long walk, buy a snack and snap a pics."
Amazed,Magnificent views of the statues are something that you can't miss whenever you're travelling here! Gyeongbuk Palace is only a walk-distant from here.
Difficult to miss in your travels,"Even if you didn't plan to visit the square, it's location means that chances are you're bound to pass by anyways.The square is near public transport and various other attractions. Because of its proximity to political offices and the like, protests can be frequently seen taking part in the square.Icons of Korean history are forever remembered and honored through impressively large statues. It may be worth the effort to learn about these historical figures if you're planning a visit, as an increased appreciation help elevate the experience."
main square of seoul,"It is hard to miss out on this huge square if you are in Seoul. In clear weather, it is nice to walk through Gwanghwamun, towards Gyeongbokgung Palace while seeing the mountains behind the palace. "
Impressive,A huge square and a gigantic statue both of which are seeped in history. Accessible by multiple metro stations and near there embassies and a temple. 
Magnificent Statue - King Sejong,The King Sejong Statue is magnificent. Great spot for photo-taking. Walking along the square will also by-pass the National Museum of Korean Contemporary History on its right.
