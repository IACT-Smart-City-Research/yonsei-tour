learn about hangul and the great king sejong,free museum we surprisingly found as we were walking toward the palace down the middle where the fountain and outside statue is located. we went underground and entered for free. there you will find exhibits of korean artifacts. and there is an interactive area for kids and adults alike where you can make a key chain and other crafts for about 1000won. there is also a gift shop with drink refreshments and a restaurant. a good respite from the heat of summer. bathrooms are clean.
Free museum to better understand King Sejong & Admiral Yi Sun-Shin,"This is actually a museum, whose entrance is a passageway behind the Statue of King Sejong the Great. The museum exhibits has English explanation, dedicating the life and achievements of King Sejong. There is a small movie room where you can watch a video as well. It also connects to another part of the museum dedicated to Admiral Yi Sun-Shin. He is famous for defeating the Japanese with the famed turtle ship that helped win the war. There is a replica of a turtle ship you can walk on. Being underground and free admission, it is a good way to take a break from the heat or rain, enjoy some air con and also use the toilet facilities."
Nice to learn about Hangul,"Briefly, we passed by the memorial hall of King Sejong. It was a nice area to check Korea's hangul (alphabet) history."
In memory of Greatest King of Korea,"Constructed in the memory Greatest king of Korea, King Sejong , this underground museum traces his life, achievement and contribution to the development of the nation."
Great to pass by and get know more about Korean history,"We passed by the underground museum when we were heading to the Palace from the Stream. The entrance way under the King’s statue, no admission fee. Good to have a quick visit if you don’t have much time. Not so crowded as other places in Seoul."
Good to pass by if you're in Gwanghamun Square,"This underground museum is a good place to visit if you're passing by Gwanghamun Square. It's a good way to escape the heat during a hot day, to warm yourself during winter and to pass time during a rainy day.You'll get to be inspired by the story of King Sejong as you walk thru the tunnel, read his achievements and see how his works have benefited the country."
Informative,"Connected with the king Sejong statue on the guanghuamun square and it's a free admission exhibition, which shows how the Hanja was created (by king Sejong) the evolution of Korea, next to it is the Yi sun sin exhibition, which shows a replica of the infamous turtle battleship. There are activities for kids also practising Hanja characters, rebuilding of the battle ship etc. "
Free Museum - Great for a Rainy Day!,"Not being familiar with this aspect of Korean history, this was a nice introduction. The museum is open, modern, and well maintained. Offered several opportunities for children to interact using technology. This would be good for a rainy day as it is all indoors. It is located near the Palace, Ferry Memorial, and US embassy. There are several coffee shops within walking distance. To be honest, I didn't go too into depth at this museum, but it was nice to walk around and get the gist of it."
Good Information about Korea,"Lot of Information is on display. Videos , Photos & Historic relics have been kept insideMust visit for Tourists"
Very informative Museum,"This place has interactive displays and some very informative sections on two of Korea's greatest heroes. As a non-Korean speaker there was still enough information for me to get a great deal out of our visit. Not sure the 4D film added much, but it was free, and only lasted 9 minutes!"
Loved it!,"While walking from Gyeongbuk Palace, we noticed a family walking into what we called a 'hidden door' under the statue of King Sejong. We crossed the street to the traffic island, went down the 'secret entrance' and found ourselves in the awesome free museum. The museum seems to be divided into two portions, with the 2nd half talking about Admiral Yi and his infamous turtle ships. 300 enemy ships Vs 12 of his own... WOW! We enjoyed this pace so much and found ourselves talking about it for several days, that we went back just to walk through the turtle ship again and ended up getting a pretty sweet turtle ship souvenir. This place is awesome and fun for folks of all ages!"
to enrich your knowledge about Korea,"if you go to Gyeongbuk Palace, don't forget to visit this place also. You'll find very complete story about Korean history especially Korean most respected heroes, King Sejong and General Lee Soon Shin. You can see how King Sejong built the Korea and how Lee Soon Shin protected Korea during their old war. It is designed very attractively, as you they provide many information through games. this is also a location for Running Man (famous Korean TV show) on episode 7.It's free, no entrance ticket."
Good Historical Museum of early Korea,"This museum is free and if you leave an ID behind they will give you a free audio guide which was fairly comprehensive. It was a really interesting historical museum on the early history of Korea. Museum talks about the early history of King Sejong (세종이야기) one of the early Kings. This King was very interested in getting the population to be literate and created a script and a new alphabet, called Hangeul. YOu can practice writing this language and take home a souvenier. It tries to be a very high tech museum. The museum includes interactive exhibits suitable for kids as well. The other half of the museum is dedicated toAdmiral Yi Sunhin who was the commander of the Korean navy and was integral in eliminating the Japanese threat in 1597. He is also credited with inventing the turtle boat, a ship that is covered with spikes to prevent boarding. If you are a military history buff tan this museum is defintiely for you. Lots of explanations of the great ships he built and had designed and how he started the navy and all sorts of military tactics and ship.s have models of these ships you can walk on and explore. Much fun for kids and adults interested in fighting and battles. Great if you are on the way from Gyeongbokgung or Gwanghwamun."
beautiful monoment and museum,they have everything in both Korean and English which was good.It is a pretty museum in a pretty area of the city
King sejong centre of seoul attraction,"Once you are at king sejong memorial hall, you will be centre of seoul tourist attraction places. It's surrounded by palaces, gwanghwamun, cultural street, traditional costume photography, guard changing ceremony, and many2 more. You will have a full day pack with entertaiment and interesting experiences"
Good overview of two historical figures,"Not the best laid out museum, however, this is a free museum that gives you an insight into two important historical figures. Half of the museum is dedicated to Admiral Yi Sunhin who was the commander of the Korean navy and was integral in eliminating the Japanese threat in 1597. He is also credited with inventing the turtle boat, a ship that is covered with spikes to prevent boarding.The other half of the museum highlights the story of King Sejong with particular emphasis on Hanguel. It is a free museum and we spent around an hour here. I think it offers a good introduction to these two men and outside the museum you can see their two statues.We went during the school holidays. The noise reverberates around the exhibition hall, meaning we could not hear the information being played on the videos."
Understanding the history of hangeul,"The Story of King Sejong (세종이야기) is an interesting museum where you can find out the history of hangeul, or the Korean writing invented by King Sejong. The museum includes interactive exhibits suitable for kids as well. The museum is quite small so you may just need to spend 30-45mins there. Great if you are on the way from Gyeongbokgung or Gwanghwamun. The Gwanghwamun square is used for festivals and events from time to time. The Story of King Sejong is accessible via the Sejong Center for the Performing Arts on the left, or the entrance from behind the statue of King Sejong."
Pleasantly surprised!,"I've always thought there is only a King Sejong status at this area and didn't know a memorial hall exists! Would have missed it if I didn't go to Gyeongbokgung on Tuesday (It is closed every Tuesday!!!). So we walked to King Segong Memorial Hall by chance.It is a mini museum documenting King Sejong's contributions to the country and how great a king he is. He came up with Hangeul as he felt that his citizens at that time could not effectively express themselves with the consonants and vowels used more widely in China. His other contributions include meteorological studies, invention of rain gauge, etc to make life of his citizens better. For those who enjoy museums, please bring your passport or ID to borrow the audio set for better understanding. Overall he is being showcased as a benevolent and learned king. I've read a bit of Korean history and is sad to learn that there are not many great kings during the Choseon period so I like the fact that they remember the greatness of Sejong even till this very day.Expect to spend at least an hour here. You may consider having lunch at one of the restaurants in the same area or pop by to the next museum - General Yi Sun Shin Museum which is connected by an walk way. Free entrance fee and is closed on Monday. There is also a small cafe and souvenir shop with many seats around for rest. Great for rainy days."
Gwanghwamun Square,"A very accessible place, near National Museum of Korea and Gyeongbokgung Palace. You can also wear traditional korean dress for free :)"
Very Much Enjoyed,"This lesser known and visited Museum is informative and creatively designed. I went with my husband who loves to stop and read everything while I read a little less, and we were both able to stay occupied/entertained. Make sure to visit the Yi Sun Shin Museum which is connected to King Sejong (both are underground). Both seem much newer than some of the other museums we visited and they would also be a fun place to bring kids."
