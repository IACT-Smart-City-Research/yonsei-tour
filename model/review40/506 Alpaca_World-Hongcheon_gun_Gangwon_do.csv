Not worth the trip,"There's no public transport to Alpaca World, so you'll have to grab a taxi from Namchuncheon Station (it'll cost around 40,000 won for one way). Do install Kakao Taxi as we called for a normal taxi via the hotline and it took around 1 hr of waiting time before it arrived. All the visitors there were the locals who drove there. I'd say the travelling time wasn't worth it."
Disappointing,"We took a day tour covering nami island and alpaca world. After Nami island we had to travel further up for another 1 hour plus before we reached the place. Maybe it wasn't peak season, there were only a couple other visitors so the park was very quiet. The alpacas looked very skinny and dirty - maybe their fur was trimmed during summer? The animals in the park were confined in a small space with insufficient space to roam about and they don't seem active and happy. In fact we feel a bit sad for them. All in all, I don't think it's worth the time to travel so far (we took about 2.5 hrs to return to myeongdong) and atmosphere was not a fun and happy place to enjoy as the animals don't seem very well taken care of. I would recommend to spend the time elsewhere instead."
Great for the kids; The place is not that big,"Visited this place by a day trip booked with Klook.We went on the mini-train ride with the help of a kind korean lady to buy the tickets, have our lunch (fried corndog, tuk-sausage stick), feed the deers, alpaca watching and also walking around all done in 2.5 hours. The place was much smaller than we thought. Definitely a place where the kids could run around freely and enjoying feeding the alpaca, rabbits, and deers."
Go at the right season,"We were there in first week of April. It's about 3 hours coach ride from Seoul. Alas much of the attractions in the theme park appeared to be closed or under maintenance. There are still the walking trails which is nice to do in that cool weather, but still, we were there for the animals not the trails. Seems like we were there too early in the year and that May or June would be a better time to visit."
Alpaca's r cute,Alpaca world was a great park to go too as there are a lot of animals and the alpacas r really cute and friendly. A good recommendation.
Alpaca world is great,It was a good zoo to come too especially seeing those adorable alpaca which are really friendly and cute
Relatively New Attraction in South Korea,"Alpaca World is a relatively new attraction in South Korea. A 2-3 hours drive away from Seoul, you might want to include this attraction into your itinerary if you’re into alpacas and other furry animals like rabbits and sheeps. There are ample opportunities to take really nice scenic photos and we highly recommend that you visit during spring time. When we were there in Winter, it was really cold. Having said that, children and adults will definitely enjoy their time here as there are opportunities available to walk the alpaca and feed them. Feeds and other adhoc activities like the monorail and walking the alpaca are charged separately though."
A great day here!,It’s a valuable chance to meet so many alpaca here! We can feed it or even have a walk with it! Don’t miss the chance to come here!
A good place for family!,"I had been there in July 2018 with my family. Although it is a bit far from the city, it is worth to visit and there are lots of different kinds of animals except Alpaca. You can touch and take pics with the alpaca over there. Besides, there is a train in the slope you must experience as the staff will give you a cup of food to feed the alpaca while you are on the train. "
Fun and Adventure trip!,"Free n easy to Alpaca World is like go at your own risk if you decided to take the last public bus! 535pm (bus will arrived and take off early, stand on the roadsite and wait! Else bus will just drive off!) I notice bus number 3 drove by same driver, so if he is sick, good luck to you! Unless you can call a taxi, else there is no transport back to town! Nov is a cold weather, temperature drop to 2° and sunset is around 510pm. Something that not very tourist friendly is that the stuff will lock the makeshift waiting room (with heater) at around 5pm. So we have to wait outside in the cold for about half n hr! Aside from this, the park is fun and kids friendly (not suitable for handicap or elderly with problem walking), prepare to climb lots of hill! Highly recommended. My family have a great fun around the park for one whole day. "
A very nice trip!,All the animals here are so cute and you can feed them all! The scenery here is also great! You can take nice pictures here!
Rainy day in Alpaca,"Don’t come on a rainy day! You can’t do much here. It’s a great experience to feed and touch, get closer to Alpaca but too bad the weather wasn’t on our side this time."
The place to visit if you like alpacas!,"Came here alone without the tour and gosh it was hours of journey before getting here but great experience as everyone was friendly and helpful! From ticket sales to cafe staffs. Thank you for your warm and welcoming efforts. Hope to see the alpacas and everyone again. =) If you are travelling here without joining a tour, do prepare the entire day as the journey is long and a few transfers are required. Taking the ITX from Yongsan would be the best choice but at Chuncheon Station you won’t be able to purchase ITX tickets back to Yongsan so do purchase the return tickets before getting here!"
