"Giant paintings, old printed books, small","It's a fabulous addition to Tongdosa temple. If you go to the museum, slip into the temple.It's a pretty small museum, maybe only 6 galleries, mostly large ancient paintings.There I SAW THE OLDEST PRINTED BOOK I'D EVER SEEN!!!!! It was pre-guttenberg, from the early 1400s, I got so excited. Sorry about the nerd moment.Also, the interior decorations are nice. English signage is good. There are permanent displays and temporary exhibitions. You need to pay to get into the temple, but you don't need to pay more to see the museum. The monks charged with the museum were really friendly."
