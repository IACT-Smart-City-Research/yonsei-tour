Oido Review,"Oido is very nice place, a must-see location for Seoul visitors. It is possible to travel there by metro from Seoul Station. It takes about 90 minutes to arrive to Oido. Then it is necessary to take bus (number 30-2) to go to seaside. There is nice walkway along sea. There are many restaurants with a lot of sea food selection. I recommend sea food next to this Red Lighthouse. You can choose the sea food which you wish and they prepare. It is quite nice experience for street food, sometimes raw but always tasty."
Sun set and seafood grill,"We start our journey from Seoul Station at noon time. It takes about one and a half hour to get there by train. When arrived we need to take a bus number 30-2 to the red lighthouse. But we were so luck that a mini bus 11C arrive before the normal bus, and the stops for this minibus are much much lesser, so we can get to the red lighthouse much quicker. The fare for these two type if bus are the same 1300 won, if you have T Money, you only need to paid 1200 won, time to the lighthouse is about half an hour. When we get there, lots of seafood restaurant along with the dam. At the end of the dam was the red lighthouse. Lovely place to spend a day on it, you can feeding the birds, play fireworks and choose a seafood restaurant and have a good dinner."
Great area to walk around. ,The area has a lot of space to park and walk around high above the roads. Many folk here walking with their loved ones and children on this Sunday afternoon. The lighthouse is a beacon and is very red. Great view looking over the harbour. 
Landmark,"Landmark of Oido. But this lighthouse is indeed red, and nothing more. You can take few pictures and that would be enough for this spot."
Happy red light house,"Great place to visit for one day trip by rail. Lots to do, see and eat. Very close from Seoul. Fully recommend it. "
Well It sure Is Red,It's a red light house on a rather dirty looking seafront surrounded by seafood restaurants. There's a nice walk along the front with fireworks being sold in the evening. Don't expect to get to the Sea though as it's fenced off.
