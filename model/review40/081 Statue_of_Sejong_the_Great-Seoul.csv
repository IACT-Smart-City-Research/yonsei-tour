Old Sejong The Great-The Guy Who Created Hangul,"This is one of two impressive statues in Gwanghaman Square, the other being that of Admiral Yi Sun-Sin. Sejong lived from 1307 until 1450 and was the fourth King in the Jaseon Dynasty.The title of Great"" apparently bestowed on all kings after they died but Sejong did invent the Korean alphabet , known as Hangul and promoted science and other good things.And a nice, big and impressive statue it was and fitting for a historic ruler."
Big golden statue,One of the statues in the square where you can watch the palace and the mountain view behind it. Good for some photos.
Sejong the Great,The Stature of Sejong the Great is usually very busy around Daytime. So make sure you have time. Go in the morning or evening to make some good pictures with the montains behind the stature. Also there are a lot of other great tourists spots around the stature which you may should check out. 
Imposing statue,"This imposing statue is the focal point in Gwanghwamun Square. It is to honour King Sejong the Great, the fourth and most respected king of the Joseon Dynasty and creator of Hangeul, Korea's alphabet. A passageway behind the statue leads to a museum, featuring the life and achievements of this king. Free admission."
A grand statue ,Loved the location on the large square with the mountains in the background. We were delighted to find a door behind the statue which led to a museum about Sejong the Great where we learnt he invented the Korean alphabet!
Great to see it!,"I was here, and I was amazed at the creation of the statue and the history behind it. Come here if you want to enjoy history :)."
The Heart of Seoul,"Ever since I've watched a drama about King Sejong, I knew I had to visit his statue and take a photo with him. Little did I know that it's in the center of Seoul. It is very easy to find and impossible to miss when visiting the Gyeongbokgung Palace, Cheonggyecheon Stream, and other famous spots in Seoul.King Sejong's statue is among the popular tourist spots in the area so don't miss taking a souvenir photo with him. You might just have to fall in line. And maybe ask for someone to take your photo if traveling alone like me."
best king,"so majestically built to one of the best king during joseon dynasty. if I am a Korean, I feel really and totally proud."
Greatest King of Korea,"The statue of King Sejong one of the greatest rulers of Joseon Dynasty has been installed in the G Square as a gratitude for his contribution in strengthening the Joseon Dynasty and also as an inventor of Korean Alphabets – the Hangeul, Armillary globe, rain gauge, the Sun dial etc. He is remembered for his contribution to the great strides Korea made in the field of agriculture, science, technology.The bronze statute which is about 9.5 meters high shows the King sitting with a book in his hand and a gentle smile. There are around 6 columns behind the statue showcasing the accomplishments of this great king.There is also an exhibition underground depicting the achievements of the king which is open to public.Include the visit to this place along with the visit G Palace."
"The entrance to the underground museum is beneath the statue, in the front",Located at Gwanghwamun. Good place to visit before/after Gyeongbokgung! The exhibitions were all in Korean though.
Father of Korean Alphabet,"This big bronze statue of Sejong the Great (1397-1450) stands on a pedestal in the middle of Gwanghwamun Plaza. Designed by Kim Yeong-Won and placed here in 2009, the depiction honors the scholar king, whose accomplishments include the invention of Hangeul, the Korean alphabet. We came across the statue when walking on the plaza toward the nearby Gyeongbokgung Palace.King Sejong is presented in royal attire, seated on a throne. The right arm is stretched outward and the left hand holds a book. He smiles, perhaps portraying his philosophy of love for his people. Behind the statue stand six columns with information about the king's major achievements. A door by the statue's base leads to an underground exhibition hall on the king and another about Admiral Yi Sunshin. A statue of the admiral stands about 820 feet south of this one on the plaza. We took a detour from our palace goal to visit the two halls. As history buffs, we found them both to be informative and well curated."
Interesting statue,It’s a pretty cool statue to keep an eye out for as you head towards the palace - hard to miss as its in the middle of the street!
Large imposing statue at the centre of Gwanghwamun Square,"This is an important landmark in Seoul anddepicts the 15th century Korean monarch, Sejong the Great, the fourth king of Joseon dynasty. It is strategically located in Gwanghwamun Square with the backdrop of Gyeongbokgung Palace. The king is presented smiling and sitting on his golden throne with one hand raised and the other resting on a book.His main claim to fame is the invention of Hangul, the official alphabet of the Korean language. This consists of 14 consonants and 10 vowels. I haven't studied this much more but I was amused to be accosted in a nearby street by two young teenage girls who wanted to interview me as a foreigner, give me a pamphlet on Hangul and show me how to write my first name in Hangul."
King Sejong the Great,"In Gwanghwamun Square there are two statues, one of which is of King Sejong, who reigned from 1418 - 1450 when he died. This statue is illuminated at night and you should see it then if you are in the area."
interesting,nice spot in front of the palace with lots of historical background as learning lesson for tourism like me
Creator of Korean characters ,"Sejong emperor is one of the most respected emperors in Korea. It was he who created Hangul, Korean characters. Nowadays everyone uses it, but at that time his action was protested by many Confucian schoolers, who used Chinese characters."
Best place on Earth,"I don’t exactly know why but this place is definitely the one that I prefer in this world.Being in front of this statue, close to the palace (and nature) and at the same time, being rounded by buildings.. amazing"
Huge Monument,"We were walking towards the Gyeongbukgong Palace to watch the changing of the guards when we came to a huge momument of a well known person in South Korea, the Statue of Sejong the Great. We did not waste time and started clicking for souvenir photos and at the same time searching Google to learn about this Great Man sitting on a big chair atop a pedestal in the Gwanghwamun Square walk path leading to the palace. We learn that Sejong the Great was born in 15May1397 and was the 4th King of Joseon dynasty of Korea. He ""reinforced the Confucian policies then created and promulgated the Korean alphabet Hangul.""He died either in the year 1442 or 1450 according to scholars of Korean history."
"The statue of Great King, Sejong.","C ( 17.12.06 ) King Sejong is great king in Korea history. The King sejong made Korean alphabet, Hangeul, the most scientific letter. The statue was landmark in this area with the statue of Yi Sun-sin. There was good museum under this statue, and must go."
Sejong the Great,Iconic statue of Great King Sejong. The location is strategic and can be accessed from the Gwanghwamun Gate. Very good place to take a quick photo session or admire Korean Culture and History.
Quick photo. ,Just a quick pass by the statue for a photo. It could have been better if the stage behind it (there was a concert the night before) was not there. So that the palace gates would be visible in pictures
Great King,"The King Sejong Statue is located at the centre of Gwanghawmun Square. This is a grand square that is located in front of the Gwanghwamun Gate. The king is best remembered for the Korean alphabet which he invented. He was a wise king who led Korea in the fields of science and technology. He invented the rain gauge, the sundial and a celestial globe. He also made great progress in agriculture and literature. That is why the statue of the king has a book in his hand.The statue is made of bronze and is about ten metres high. Behind the statue, there are six columns with golden carvings. These tell the story of what the king achieved and accomplished. On the side of the square is a stream that flows on tiles that have Korean inscriptions. This is the “Waterway of History”."
Good for photo ops,This statue is quite iconic and having photo ops in this area is quite mandatory. Try learning about his works like introducing the Korean alphabet and how these are displayed well in the vicinity.
Huge monument,"Sitting right outside the Museum of Korea, directly in front of the palace gates, this vast statue towers above the traffic and makes a good photo op."
Iconic Statue in Gwanghwamun,"While not being the sole reason for visiting Gwanghwamun Square Sejong's statue stands as a reminder to the citizens of Seoul that King Sejong was an iconic leader as well as the instigator of the Korean alphabet, 'hangeul'. Te statue gazes along Sejong Ro and as such provides the ideal photo opportunity to both tourists and locals alike."
Better at night ,This is an impressive statue. However it is still just a statue. It's lit up at night. Located at the front of the palace 
A statue in Seoul,"There isn't much to this statue in the middle of the street near one of the best palaces in the country and the Blue House. If you're around Seoul long enough, you'll see it, but you shouldn't go out of your way. "
Prominent statue,"We found this statue in Gwanghwamun square. It was an imposing statue, very nice and it was built to remember a great and respected king. There is a free museum nearby."
Imposing and central,"There is always something going on in the park around this statue, but that doesn't reduce how cool he is against the backdrop of the Palace and the mountains. Worth visiting."
Good to visit to learn about this famous Korean,A nice monument to the this great respected Korean. There is a small museum or information center on his inventions and achievements. Very nice place to learn about some Korean history.
Visited many times still like this place.,"In another post re: Gwanghamun Square, I mention that there is a museum that you can enter for free for a great cultural experience. I highly recommend the King Sejong Exhibit Hall which is located at the backside under the statue."
Remember the statue is also entrance to the museum.,"Remember to visit the museum under the statue. That is the most interesting part, the history of King Sejong and the history of battles at sea with the Japanese navy."
Interesting,"This statue it is probably the first thing you will see when you come out of Gwanghwamun Station, exit 9. Located in the middle of Gwanghwamun Square, this statue is built in to honour King Sejong, the creator of the Korean alphabet.If you go behind the statue, you will find the entrance to an underground museum about the King. I did not go in as it was before opening hours."
A statue to honor a great ruler,"King Sejong is the 4th king of the 500 year old Joseon Dynasty and reigned for 32 years from 1418 to 1450. His contributions to the kingdom include using the principles of Confucianism in politics, advancing science and technology, strengthening Korean military while emphasizing foreign policy, and creating the Korean alphabet Hangul. An impressive resume which fully deserved a giant statue in the middle of Gwanghwamun Square!"
Symbolic figure,"In front of the Gyeongbokgung palace, it was interesting to see this grand statue commanding a view across the square. Worth a visit as symbolic and close to the Kin statue.Thanks for the vote if you found this review helpful."
Meaningful,"I personally find myself humbled and awe at this majestic statue everytime I visit Seoul- perhaps it's because of who and what King Sejong represents. TIP (For the bookish) : After or before visiting the Statue, make the most of your time in the location and visit the Kyobo (underground) bookstore."
Interesting but plain,"Interesting as statues go, but for me worth mentioning is the revived stream with a gushing waterfall (frozen in the winter) nearby. Locals sit in the shade of the bridge and dip their feet in the water in summer."
Near the palace,I thought it was a great statue and great for pictures. We had gone to visit the palace which is within walking distance. There were a lot of school children there. If you use the hop on hop off it is close to the pick up area.
On the square and on the banknote.,"The statue of Sejong the Great was erected on the square recently in 2009. Author is sculptor Kim Young-won. The authors established the 9-meter bronze statue on a concrete pedestal. We can find under the pedestal a small Museum . Sejong looks at the fine arts Museum, named in his honor. Kings were rarely discovered various talents, often ruled without them. Sejong is the exception. He was artistically gifted, which was highly prized in Korea and China. Most importantly, of course, that he was a talented statesman. His political successes were based on public administration reform. He brought to Korea Chinese officials, who were recruited not on the hereditary principle, and abilities. New Korean bureaucracy guided by Confucian ethics, have achieved victory over the Japanese pirates and normalized relations with both Japan and China. That's what the Koreans established king Sejong at the main square, and on the banknote of 10,000 won in addition."
Lovely statue of King Sejong in Gwang hwa mun square and its secret,"There is a lovely statue of king Sejong, a reformist king of the Joseon dynasty. He is very much respected for the great works he did. The statue sits in Gwanghwamun square which leads to GyeongBokgung palace. what most tourists fail to see is the little passage which leads below the statute. There is a museum below the square which explains the history and significance of two important persons King Sejong and Admiral Yu Soon Shin. both persons feature on the korean Won currency. It was very educational but this secret museum isn't mentioned anywhere in the tourist brochures or guide books. "
City Center,If you head to the City Center you will see this statue. Be sure to learn about his gift to the people of the Korean alphabet.
Nice photo spot!,This statue is just at the square at the front of the palace so that you can enjoy taking nice photo with the palace's gate as a background.
If you are around,If you are around go and see the plase. Close to the palace so walk few hundred meters to see it. Nice. 
Very pretty,"Very pretty, especially at night when it is lighted up. It is obviously, that this emperor was very loved by the Koreans."
Big Statue,Before You go to Gyeongbokgung palace you must take a picture in Sejong Centre. Not just this statue you can take a picture another statue too.
Profound respect,"Taking into consideration that he was the creator of the most logic phonetic alphabet you just have to show the respect to such great mind. Of course, this is subjective thought by Hangul enthusiast :)"
Central historical feature,"This statue is obviously highly valued, as it was protected by police when we saw it. Underneath there is an underground museum about King Sejong the Great, and his story, and inventions. DIsplays about Korean writing were particularly fascinating. "
An amazing statue of a great man,went into Seoul for the day and saw the Statue of King Sejong. It was so amazing just to think of the great accomplishments he brought to the world.
Just OK,"This status is located in the middle of big square in the modern city theme , close to Koreans historic palaceTakes just 10 to 15 min to visitI'd rather to spend more time in the palace which is very beautiful :) "
Impressive!,"Located near the largest palace. Very impressive, large gold statue of the king. Great place for photography. Worth a visit!"
Important piece of historyb,I happened to stumble upon this statue and did not realize how important this person is to South Korea. 
Iconic in Seoul,"Statue of Sejong the Great is located in Gwanghwamun Square, very close to Gyeongbokgung Palace. We personally enjoy the underground museum. It is lovely, informative and well-designed."
Everything about Sejong is interesting,"The museum and his statue are awesome. Definetly a must see. Such important man in the history of Korea, creating the Hangul. Worth it!"
Day trip to Seoul,This statue is located just outside of the Subway. Go early because there are activities going on nearby so it may be crowded.
Interesting,Spend a few moments admiring the statue then visit the palace or walk the streets. It is centrally located.
Must see in Seoul,"Your visit in Seoul will not be complete unless you drop by the Statue of King Sejong. Located in Gwanghwamun Square, you will easily find this place. Too bad though since there were barricades and people rallying within the area (Gwanghwamun square) when I visited this place last week."
Iconic Statue,"He's the man who built the Korean alphabet - the basis to the entire language - kind of a big deal. All kidding aside, there's a museum underground that provides a lot more of the historical background - definite must-see if it's your first time touring Seoul. "
Visit the museum underneath,Good photo opportunity with the Palace gate and mountains in the background. Just behind the statue is a door that leads to the underground museum. In this free museum you can get the history of Sejong and why he is one of Korea's heros.
Honeymoon @ Statue of Sejong the Great,"We passed by the Statue of Sejong the Great - after reading its history, he is definitely one of the greatest historical person.Worth the time to take a photo with this statue. Heard that this area will have ""rebel"" on Fri and Sat. Roads may be closed. Policemen will be sighted."
Statue of Sejong the Great was at Gwanghwamun Square,The Staute of Sejong the Great was at Gwanghwamun Square; I went there by subway. Recommended to visit the museum and art galleries around the area.
Impressive,"This is the statue of the king Sejong who invented the Korean language in 1414. It was a mark of independence on that time, because until that Koreans used the Chinese language. That's why he is so important and deserve that statue on the center od Gwangamung Square."
Statue,"Nice, big statue about the king in a great location. Middle of the square by one of the biggest temples in Korea"
Visit for pictures,"My relatives used to live around this area so I would often pass by while traveling. It's a great place to visit for pictures since it's close to the Gyeongbok Palace and easy access to the subway. It's a huge area so you can totally take some cool pictures! Also, underground there's a bookstore so you can spend some time there to look around and buy cute stationaries. Let me warn you that this area often has strikes and protests so it can get crowded and loud to visit on the wrong day."
Great place,This is great place to learn about King Sejong. They have underground museum connected to many others building. Great scenery to capture your moment here in Korea.The place is strategically located nearby subway station and near to US consulate office.
Must visit,"If your near Gwanghwamun gate you may as well visit this statue, its about 5mins down the main road in the center."
Must visit,"It's a great place which you must visit. I mean, you'll probably go as is one of the main attractions, but still totally worth. "
Historical Lesson,"Here, you get to see the statue of Sejong the Great, who gave Korean an identity through its own Hangul language. Otherwise, in the beginning, written language is all done in Chinese. Where this is, you get to see the Palace at the background, and you are within walking distances away to National Performing Centre, Seoul Art Centre, Wall Gate and the Cheonggye stream. You can easily spend half a day here. If you haven't been to Seoul before, it's worth your while to come here."
A place to get great shots of Seoul,"The statue of the man who gets credit for introducing the Korean alphabet is cool. It's also a great place to get a wonderful city view of the Gwanghwamun area. It's conveniently near Cheonggyecheon Stream, Insadong, Gyeongbok Palace, and the Jonggak area of restaurants and shops."
photo with the emperor,Statue of Sejong the Great is in front of Gyeongbukgung Palace and also near to Bukchon village (30mins of walking). Its better to come here in the morning to enjoy cold weather (November 2016) before heading to the Palace and Palace Museum behind. It s a landmark and a need to take a photo.
Know the Great King!,Its a great place to know the history of Hangul writing and how great the King Sejong. definitely need to come here and learn more about the King.
muesum at the bottom of king sejong statue,"read more about king sejong and his achievement at the museum which is located at the bottom of the statue. during the time of visit, november 2016, we simply entered without paying.do go during the daytime and you can head over to Gyeongbokgung Palace when you are done with King Sejong's exhibitionbut AVOID going on saturday evening as there is a massive protest currently going on on every saturday evening, you wont want to be squeeze with thousands of people gathering there or ""millions"" as what the media have been saying"
A Statue in Downtown Seoul,It is just a statue which you are bound to see on a walking tour of Seoul. Sejong was a King and is also credited with devising the Korean Hangul alphabet.
Pilgrimage for Korean Learners!,"If you're learning Korean, this statue is a must-go pilgrimage. The statue of Saejong the Great King is a tribute to the king who educated the Korean populace by inventing the Korean alphabet, called Hangeul. "
My Seoul trip,"When you come out of the Gyongbokgung palace, you see a large plaza in front of it. There are buildings along both sides of the plaza.Half way along the plaza is the statue. Nothing much to see here. There were a lot of police and protestors in this area,If you walk further down along this area you can see the city hall."
Historical importance,"The statue is imposing as it sits in the middle of the walking area and the museum below was informative. It costs to enter and I am not sure if it was worth the money to go in. Done once, I wouldn't go in again although I would walk the strip again as it was pretty, relaxing and the gardens very colourful."
The greatest king ,There are two 2 greatest person statues at the Gwanghwamun Square that one is the greatest king Sejong in Chosun Period. 
"Well known landmark, get a 'selfie' :)","Sejong the Great was the fourth king of Joseon-dynasty and inventer of Hangul, the Korean alphabet system!"
its a statue,"as an attraction on its own, it is not something you plan to see.But as part of a bigger route then you will pass this statue.a good route is:Gwanghwamun Square (where this statue is located) - Gyeongbokgung Palace - Bukchok Hanok village - Changeokgung Palace - Insadong - Cheonggyecheon Stream"
Well respected King,A very impressive statue of very respected King. He died in the 15th century but left a solid mark on the country. An obvious integral part of Korea's history.
Gorgeous statue with an important history,This is a great statue to see while visiting Seoul. Sejong the Great is very important in Korean history and the citizens are very proud of the statue. It is absolutely beautiful and worth a 20-30 minute walk around the square to admire it. It also looks very dramatic at night.
King of Korean alphabet ,"As i informed this is sign of a king , witch made Korean alphabet.Also you will see alphabet there.A good view to the palace here also nice walking boulevard."
Statue in front,Located in front of the gyeonggokbuk palace this statue is nice for take a photo for a short trip . go here
Impressionant & In a great location!,"The statue of Sejong the Great was very impressionant! Not only great to look at but you also receive a bit of knowledge of the Korean history. The location was perfect because not only is it in downtown, but you also get a wonderful view of the mountains and gate!"
Very interesting ,Really cool place.If you're interested in history this is perfect for you .But even if you're not its one of the best things to see in Seoul 
Important Person in Korea's History,History lovers would enjoy learning about this king's achievements in the history. The statue looks great in the day and even better at night with the lights. Police are always around the area for security purpose. It's a great place to take a nice photo and it's just a very short walk away from Gyeongbokgung Palace.
Statue of a very important King,This is an important figure in Korean History- gracing the square and the korean won. He is responsible for inventing the Korean Alphabet and other instruments. He watches on his citizens and country and witnessed great changes. The underground centre is free and a great way to escape from the heat. It details his life and his story.
Great Underground Space,The Underground information space was better than I expected. There is a lot of information to learn and it has nice media.
Important figure of history ,"This is a must-see Museum it is super effective very informative and it learns and teaches you about who created the Korean language, known as hangul ( 한글) this is a fantastic Museum and it's definitely worth a go the only bad thing is the cafe is super expensive the coffee is ridiculously expensivego! "
important leader in Korean history,This statue is easy to visit as it is in the heart of Seoul near Seoul City Hall and Deoksugung Palace. There is a small and free museum underground near the statue that tells you more about his life. The museum is OK to visit and it is open late (after the palaces close) so it is good to come here at night to maximize your sight-seeing. 
Museum,There is a Museum underground that you enter in the back of the Statue It was so amazing to go through & I learned so much about so many thing there. How the language got started as well.
Great!,It's located on the side street near Gwanghwamun gate. By just walking from the gate and you'll find the statue. Very iconic !
Reminder of history,The inscription of the words on the statue are a reminder of the history of King Sejong... A great king who created the Hangul.
Beautiful Plaza at night,The location and plaza of the Statue of Sejong is so beautiful. It rivals any great boulevard such as the Mall in Washington DC and the Champs-Elysee in Paris. At night the water features are lit with colored lights and the statue is quite striking in front of Gyeungbokgung palace. 
majestic,"Rainy day experience.But the majestic elegance of Sejong the great standing out in the open space is just amazing,Please go down to the museum below statue.Very easy to miss it."
You better read about him,You will understand this statue if you read a little about this person...and then you'll understand a lot about the Korean culture.It is a must if you know who he is.
Next to the main entrance to the Palace,Since it is just next to the main entrance to the Palace you will be near anyway. It is a nice spot to see the gate to the palace surrounded by green mountains. Not worth to see it on its own though
Might as well,"If you're going to visit the largest palace (Gyeongbokgung Palace) You might as well take picture with King Sejong and Admiral Yi. They are located at Gwanghwamun Sq, which is a stretch of road leading to the palace. To go here: Take metro line 5 and stop at Gwanghwamun St, exit 2, directly to the Gwanghwamun Sq. Move towards the palace and stop and take pic along the road."
It's a nice place to pass by on your way to the palace,"A very grand statue for a very important figure of Korean history. The square has a lot of police people guarding it because of the surrounding embassies and fear of protesters, but on your walk to see the old palaces, take a photo for the memories."
Nice Statue,This is in a square between the road leading to and from the palace gates. Very well done with musem with entrance in the back.
nice alley complex,It is located in front of the gyeongbokgung in the central avenue of modern building. The status is about 3 meters tall. It can be reached by metro line and exit at gwanghwamun station. Usually it is guarded by several of security guard since it is located near US Embassy.
Windy but nice spot to see Seoul's contradictions,"Great protest site,public area, local mount view and feel spot for Seoul's modernity and tradition in one spot. Look out for the palace wall made by the Japs and extended towards the road locally. Also stroll around not just for selfies, but for the national protest site it can be."
Golden oldie,"This is another terrific statue in Gwanghwamun Square. Sejong shares the square with the impressive statue of Admiral Wi. Plus, Gyeongbokgung Palace is not far from the Square, so you can combine all of the attractions at once. The Palace has a colourful changing of the guards too.There's a subway station right there (the purple line - line 5). Sejong the Great King was a visionary too, and some of the inventions he was involved in are laid out before him in the Square - a rain gauge, a sundial and an armillary sphere.A subterranean telling of his story (and Admiral Wi) is nearby."
Next to my hotel,Nice view from hotel. See pictures. And there is museum beneath. For history lovers and Asian architect seekers. You should stroll through.
Looking for a toilet lead me to this place instead,"It was not a planned trip. To be honest, I was having high fever on that day but who could miss out on sightseeing even if we are on our last breath. Ok so moving on, I needed the loo, to wash my face and to get out of the freaking cold, I saw an entrance with an elevator and I though, why not? I told my other companions to follow me. We took the elevator down and to my surprise, it was a free museum. I walked in and immediately I realized that this is my kind of place. Full of history and information on King Sejong and the Great general Yi Shun Shin. I was dumbfounded by the beauty of the place and best of all, it was underground. Amazing. Most of the reading panels are in English and you can even ask for an audio guide from the Information counter. Of course I did get my toilet break plus a 15 minutes nap on one of the benches but when I woke up. I suddenly realized this place was kinda familiar. Then I already knew that I had watched this place on TV before. And for those who didn't know, like my companions didnt, it was one of the shooting place for Running Man's episode 7 if I am not mistaken but with all the history around, who really care? Except me.. Overall, I am happy I stumbled upon this wonderful treasure whilst looking for a toilet."
Majestic statue of King Sejong the Great,"This is a fairly new statue (by new I mean like 2009) that stands in the middle of a really large street in Seoul. You'll see the statue if you take line 5 (purple) on the subway and get off at Gwanghwamun station. It stands in front of Kyungbok Palace, the largest/main Chosun palace in Seoul. The area in general is an interesting area where you can see the intersection of the old and modern."
Sejong statue monument,"If you are visiting Gyeongbokgung Palace, you can take straight way across the street from the palace gate. There you can see the Sejong Statue monument and take some picture."
"Boring, well not for history buffs I suppose",I passed by this so many times but never once stopped to read it. A statue of an beloved Korean King who invented Hangeul: the Korean alphabet. He is a hero because it made it possible for the common people to read and write as the Chinese characters that were used were very difficult to learn and reserved for scholars. 
Big statue,"Being on the square in front of the biggest Seoul palace, most likely you will pass of going there. You can't miss it as it is in the middle of the square and visible from the whole square (in front of the US embassy)"
Nice statue,In Gwanghwamun Square. Good walk around on the way to Gyeongbokgung Palace. Probably worth going to since there are a couple of attractions in the vicinity.
Wonderful,"A must see attraction in Gwanghwamun Plaza, and a breathtaking sight as you exit the Gwanghwamun Station (exit 9). There are many other things to see in the area too. Don't forget to visit the free museum right beneath the statue (entrance is around the back). "
Nice statue to King Sejong,"One of the interesting monuments you will see at Gwanghwamun Square is the gilded bronze of King Sejong, erected at this location in 2009. This monument is of a seated beloved King Sejong, his right hand raised while he hold a manuscript in his left hand. Sejong seems to be smiling down on his people. Behind the Statue of King Sejong, you can find four pillars with gold reliefs portraying scenes from the King's life. In front of the statue, you will find a sundial, rain gauge and celestrial globe. These make for a nice arrangement and good photographs. At the back of the statue, you will find entrance into an underground museum area where you will find 'The Story of King Sejong' attraction, which shares space with the equally interesting 'The Story of 'The Story of Admiral Yi Sun-Shin'. This is a good opportunity to learn more about King Sejong if you are interested in this important figure in Korean history."
An impressive statue at the square,"As with the Admiral Yi statue, it would be best to view this impressive statue after learning about the accomplishments by this greatly admired Korean king. An understanding of the history and achievements attributed to this king helps you really appreciate it."
One of the greatest Joseon era kings,"Sejong is said to be one of the best or perhaps the best king of the entire Joseon dynasty, who among many other achievements, invented the Korean alphabet. His impressive statue on Gwanghwamun Square is also a popular meeting point."
Impressive,Huge statue that's super important to Korean culture. Every time I've visited it's been filled with tourists and selfie sticks but it's best to get a picture with such a big statue
"Well maintained, Right in the middle of the road","Been here for a day tour while on a business visit.Very conveniently located in city, 15 min walk from holiday inn.Weather was very pleasant.Glad to see how they preserve such a ancient monument. "
Need to Set Aside More time To Explore the Museum Below the Statue,"The statue of Sejong the Great is probably one of the most prominent landmarks in Gwanghwamun Square. No doubt it's a great spot to take customary Instagram or travel photos if you're a foreign tourist (like me), but I would highly recommend that you visit the museum below the statue which is located a couple of floors underground. You'll find more information about the King, and the many new tools such as the sundial that were used during his reign."
Nice...,"The King Sejong Statue was erected at the center of Gwanghawmun Square. Sitting with a gentle smile on his face and a book in his hand, the bronze statue of 9.5m in height celebrates the King and his great achievements. Behind the statue, there are six columns with golden carvings."
Gwanghamun Square - Sejong Statue and muzium underground,"Statue of King Sejong the Great, the fourth and most respected king of the Joseon Dynasty and creator of Hangeul, Korea's alphabet. Stretches out from Gwanghamun gate of Gyeonbokgung Palace. Very panoramic view and wide public space to take photo with blue sky and mountain view behind. The gallery and muzium underneath is good place to get knowledge of Joseon Dynasty, as well to take shelter or rest from hot sun during the summer and cold weather during other season."
Connect with the Korean culutre,"Not enough time nor space - and most likely being a foreigner - no point, to attempt to describe what impact the King had on Korea and Koreans. But there are important moments to relish while in Seoul. And this story and place can give you a time to really think on how he innovated and changed a nation and people. No selfies needed here. What is needed is a time to connect with the Korean people. "
"Sejong is love, Sejong is life",There are no adequate words to describe the majesty of the great benevolent king Sejong.Except for the ones he invented.Which you can see in the museum below.Check out the museum after taking a photo with this statue.
Impressive Monument,King Sejong monument is huge and impressive.It is located ahead of the Palace Gate. Information about him is in the underground museum below his statue.
In front of Gate,If you are going to the palace then it's on the way. It may be better at night from the look of everyone's photos.
Great statue~,Seeing the Statue of Sejong the Great for the first time is a truly breathtaking sight. I heard about this great king at 17 years ago when I began my Korean Language Study
Amazing. ,Amazing statue outside the palace. Still golden gleaming bright. Visit the museum accessible at the back and learn about him. Great statue and part of history. 
A must see,King sejong is an important figure in korean history. The statue is great for taking pictures but what the king has done and history is more fascinating to know b4 visiting :) 
Not so good,"This statue is located in the middle of Seoul. It used to be very beautiful place, but recent strike movements around Jongno messed up everything. You'd better use public transportation rather than drive your car."
Beautiful at night...,"It's didn't take so much time to see this statue, you can take beautiful pic's at night with the all lights on. "
Impressive monument,"The King Sejong Statue was erected at the center of Gwanghawmun Square on Hangeul in 2009. Sitting with a gentle smile on his face and a book in his hand, the bronze statue of 9.5m in height celebrates the King and his great achievements.The Statue is very impressive and you cannot miss if you did a bus tour for example. Otherwise easy access by 3 different metro lines.Mandatory to take a picture."
The greatest Sejong.,Along the Sejong street has many visitor to get a photograph with Statue of Sejong the Greatest. The King Sejong who created Hangul and announced it to Korean people. Close to Gwanghanum gate. Just walking distance. I came from City hall Station then keep walking.
Didn't know what it was,"We were walking in the neighbourhood of our hotel when we pumped in to this statue, we were not able to see any sign in english telling what it was so we had to google. Not sure if this is something I'd specially go look after but was quite impressing in the dark. Seems to be a popular place to hang around for the locals as well during the evenings as the place was crowded every night."
Inspiring ,"I felt honoured to visit this monument. The first time was in 2012. As a young boy, I was always fascinated with writing systems and alphabets. I studied Hangul and was very impressed by King Sejong's story. "
A statue in the middle of the street,We went there without a guide so we weren't able to know what he did. So it would be great if someone would be able to explain ir or something.
You Can't Miss This Because It's Right In The Middle of Seoul.,"I imagine travellers who visit New York wouldn't want to miss the chance to see the Statue of Liberty. The same goes with this one. You can't miss it anyway as it's there in the middle of Seoul. I walked from Changdeokgung, passed by Insadong, moved towards Gyeongbokgung. Gwanghamun Square and took a quick stop near the statue for photos. The surrounding area is busy and lively."
A must visit place,Come to this place just to try korean traditional costume for free. Snap a photo with two most popular statue snd that's it.
Seeing it on the bus/taxi will do.,I saw the statue while I was in a taxi and it's good enough for me. He created the Korean language and is a great king. A few Korean shows were done on his story.Unless you absolutely need to take a selfie with him I suppose this is one attraction you can skip.
Nice place,Good place to chill and walk. Very near to palace and stream.Lots of coffee shops around.All the events which take place here are worth seeing.
A beautiful statue,We didn't have a lot of touring time in Seoul; but we did make time to stop to get photos of the beautiful statue of Sejong the Great. it is huge and quite an impressive statue.
Just a big statue,"Don't make an effort to see it, but you probably will because it's close to so many attractions of downtown Seoul, but just a very big statue."
The king,We were here by Nov 2014. It is located at the Gwanghuamun square. There is a museum at the basement regarding the contribution and how the king create Hangul alphabet. Very big and beautiful statue.
Icon of Gwanghwamun Square,"This (rebuilt) statue is an icon of the large square (Gwanghwamun) in front of Gyeongbokgung Palace. It is in honour of the Korean emperor who invented the alphabet system for the Korean language. It's a nice statue that should appear in your photo album :)P/S: I wish tourists doing jump shots could be more considerate about others ""queueing"" to get a good full shot of the statue."
