One of the best tour in Jeju,"My family of 4 booked jeju taxi Lucas private tour for a full day. Firstly, we went for the hyeopjae beach, which the scenery was definitely great and beautiful, the driver, Mr Ko was very enriched with ideas, he helped us took many photos with different postures and even helped my parents took a honeymoon photo! , in each attraction afterwards, different postures was used to take photos, even though some were wierd but it was very funn! Mr Ko is a great, kind, helpful, gentlemen and on time person, he helped me opened the door everytime when we were about to alight from the taxi, he also came to the hotel before the tour starts so that we can have sufficient time to go to each attractions we planned before hand. Lastly, the most touching thing is that we forgot to take our bag of seaweed on the taxi and we hurriedly contact taxi Lucas, and immediately they helped us check and the driver immediately rushed over even though it was 40 minutes drive away and he came in far before the estimated time given, this bag of seaweed will remind us about this helpful driver and this is going to stay in my mind for a long time. Want to say, Jeju is a great place with kind and helpful people and beautiful scenery, thank you Mr Ko, thank you Jeju taxi Lucas, best tour in jeju!"
Jeju Island Private Half day tour: South attractions,Our trip was AMAZING thanks to Jeju Travel Lucas! He was very friendly and efficient and immediately made us very comfortable. His knowledge about everything we had questions about was informative and impressive. I would highly recommend Lucas to anyone visiting Jeju!
Unique beaches in Jeju,"Yongmeori Coast has a rocky coastline with the most unique cliff formations because Jeju is a volcanic island. A walk along this coastal region, you will also see lovely ocean views and beautiful sunset."
Incredible Jeju tour,"We had a great time visiting multiple iconic locations in Jeju on this tour. Our tour guide, Lucas, was very friendly and answered all our questions about Korea. We would definitely recommend this tour to others looking to enjoy the beautiful Jeju scenery in comfort. Overall, this tour was everything we were looking for! Thanks Lucas :)"
The Only Way to See Jeju,"Excellent company, my expectations were exceeded. All of the cars are new and clean, and are equipped with wifi and air conditioning. Communication is excellent, and the drivers are professional and show up on time, if not early. Unfortunately, due to a major delay with Delta Airlines, I lost an entire day on Jeju. Lucas made up for this by making my tour extra special, and efficient. He really made sure we visited the main locations I wanted to visit, and the lunch spot he picked was delicious. When I return to Jeju I will use this company again, and I am recommending it to any of my friends who are interested in visiting."
Day tour at Jeju,"Booked a taxi driver for the day tour at Jeju, the driver is Mr Koh, he is a very kind man and always give in to your requirement, very helpful."
Excellent,"Mr Kim arrived 30m early, was a super pleasant tour guide, agreed to our aggressive plan for the day and did everything to ensure we stayed on schedule to see everything we wanted. Definitely recommend."
Great way to experience Jeju - completely flexible and helpful,"The tour is very professionally done - always on time and delivers what is promised. The best aspect of the tour for us was the flexibility - we made some small changes on the first day to what we wanted to do, but on the 2nd day we almost completely changed the itinerary, and it was no problem at all. It allowed us to spend more time on the things that interested our group, and to do short stops at other things. We got to see and do a lot of what Jeju has to offer in the limited time that we were there."
Best way to see Jeju,"We made the best decision to hire for a hassle free private taxi tour in Jeju. The jumbo taxi is spacious and comfortable. We decide our own itinerary and the the tour agent arrange the itinerary into 2 different days according to their locations in the island. We requested for a Chinese driver but was sent a Korean driver Mr. Kim 김순남 with limited English or Chinese skill. We are still very happy with his service as he is very attentive, polite and a very good photographer too. The lunch he recommended was perfect and delicious. Overall, this is the best choice to have for a private tour in Jeju and is highly recommended. Will hire them again if we are to visit again."
Ms,"East course was very nice but the West course was rather boring. The Tea Museum was mainly a shop, not worth visiting!! We had to skip the visit item on the itinerary of the West Course because of the heavy rain. It would be good if the Taxi driver guide could give more information about the history, culture or stories about Jeju Island especially the places on the itinerary."
Enjoyable vacation in Jeju,"The first day, we visited East Jeju. Our driver was Mr. Lucas Ko. He spoke English well, and gave a good background and history of the places we visited. He was anexcellent guide, and enthusiastic in taking our photographs.The second day, we visited West Jeju, with a different driver. He was also Mr. Ko.He was soft-spoken, and took us wherever we wanted to go.Overall, we recommend both of them to anyone who wants to visit Jeju."
Great tour and guide,"My son and I only had 3 days in Jeju and one of those days was spent with our guide Mr. Lee. He was very professional, courteous and fun! We worked together to go to the sights we were interested in and he gave us plenty of time to visit each location. He took us to a local noodle restaurant that was spectacular! One that we would have never known about and we love local food. Had the best experience. And he was a great photographers! Thank you."
Mr. Koh,"Mr. Koh is straight up awesome, his English is very good for a korean and he is also a super good photographer. I would actually personally recommend this guy to give you a tour as he knows where to visit and where to take extremely good photographs. The trip with him was unforgettable. He is a very nice gentleman and also very kind. He is also very sociable and we can also talk to him without felling awkward as well. He is a superb tour guide I would really recommend him for your trip!!!"
Review!,"The journey was purely unforgettable, the service was excellent. Mr. Koh is very fond of jeju and knows his way around very well, kind and friendly person. He knows where to have a good meal and convenient locations to buy items. Overall a very good trip!"
Unesco Day Tour,My daughter and I had a wonderful experience with Lucas Koh from Nam Yang taxi tours. The tour was packed with fun and interesting activities that I would highly recommend to anyone. Our day was highlighted with a delicious meal in a local restaurant. Our guide Lucas spoke English well and was able to provide many interesting facts about Jeju Island. Thank you Lucas. We will definitely recommend your company to our friends and family.Sandra and Scotia from Canada 
Vitris,"Thank you Mr Lee for introducing us to Mr Ko.He was truly an amazing tour guide, driver and an avid photographer which was a massive bonus.We (extended family of 7) had lots of great pictures to take home because of Mr Ko.Always courteous, always on time, always a smile on his face and always go the extra mile when we ask for information.He also came right into the check in area at the airport when we flew out of Jeju instead of just leaving us at the drop off area and even bought us coffees.We have had tour guides else where in the world and none compare to Mr Ko.Highly recommended for anyone who’s looking for a tour guide in Jeju island.정말 고맙습니다"
Jeju Island: Seongsan Ilchulbong & Private Transfer,"Jeju taxi tour Lucas provide an absolutely ludicrous tour to the east side of the island. After scheduling the trip, there was an additional ₩30,000 fee to drive to our hotel. It was an 1-1/2 hour drive to Sunrise Peak, which is beautiful, only to find out we can spend only spend 70 minutes walking the base of the mountain. Afterwards another 1-1/2 hour dive back to the hotel. Sunrise Peak is easily a full day adventure. The driver tried to help and explain and the owner was off target implying we were not getting a guided tour. We were never seeking a guide but he could not get off the topic.There seems to be many tourist traps on Jeju Island who take your money and change the conditions after the fact, this is one of those cases. I would not do business with this operator ever again. Get your Guide should find another local partner."
Too funny,Allot of fun!! Had fun looking at erotic sculptures and multiple sexual positions.. had fun just playing with all the sculptures n numerous activities
Amazing driver,"A great trip that covered a lot of jeju attractions. We were lucky to have visited during the anniversary of some of the UNESCO sights so admission to a few of the areas we went to were free of charge. Our driver Mr. Su Hong was very accommodating and took us to a few extra places since we had some more time. He spoke basic English and a little mandarin, which was good for some of my non-English speaking family members. Overall, highly recommend!"
Unforgettable vacation,"We are very happy to go with Mr. Ko suhong in our 2 full day Jeju trips. He is always friendly, considerate and kind to our family. Along the trip, he arranged our itinerary very well and he took many photos for our family very professionally at scenic spots. It bring a lot of joys and memories for us."
Summer vacation,"Mr Lucas Ko was very accommodating for our trip. Not only does he answers your quries promptly, but he is also friendly in real life. During the tour, he will help you to take photos at the start and most of the journey, he allows you to venture in your own with your company. This is what we preferred. Also, you may select the places that you want and he will help you to settle the itinerary. Overall, we love our tour!"
East coast ride,"We had a lovely drive down the east coast with plenty of time to see all the attractions including the Manjanggul caves, lunch, Sanseong crater and Seopjikiji beach.The booking and communication was easy and the driver was very efficient. Would highly recommend this!"
Jeju Tour,"We are a family of 11 people. We hired Mr Lee Hong Min of Jeju Nam Yang Taxi Tour for 2 days after reading many good reviews on him. No regret having him as our driver. He also volunteered to be our tour guide and photographer instead of waiting for us in the car. He took many nice shots of us. Mr Lee is very punctual, considerate, friendly and helpful. He will check with us what we wanted to eat and then recommended eateries that were good and inexpensive. We truly appreciated Mr Lee in carrying my granddaughter (3 years old) up and down the mountain. It was definitely not an easy task and we never expected a driver to give us such a service. We will definitely hire Mr Lee Hong Min again if we are back in Jeju. "
Excellent service,"We really had a wonderful time during our stay in Jeju island and that is all because of Mr Lucas Koh, our Namyang taxi Coordinator/driver. Before we left the Philippines for our Jeju Island vacation, we were so worried because we did not join a group tour. We decided to plan our own iterinary but not knowing what places to visit we ended up booking a 2 day tour under tripadvisory a day before leaving the Philippines and that was how we met Mr. Lucas Kho. He provided us the best service that we could ever ask. He is always early/on time picking us up at our hotel always with a big smile. Never that we saw him upset during the times that he was driving us around. He recommends places to visit, places to shop so we could get and find the best bargains ever and most of all, the best restaurants to fill our hearts desires :)) We highly recommend his service and if given the chance to visit this Island again in the future, we would request Mr Lucas Koh to be our guide once again. Thank you Mr. Lucas from the Golden Girls :))"
Excellent 2 days with Mr. Shin,"We booked two days with Nam Yang taxi and Mr. Shin took us around to several places. He was very kind and caring to us. He recommended some hidden places which generally don't show up on TA or internet research, so those places were well worth it! The first day of our travel, it was raining heavily but he still took us around and made the most of the day. We were travelling with a toddler who obviously got annoying at times but Mr. Shin was very patient and looked after our toddler too. Thank you so much again and we have no hesitation to book Nam Yang taxi tours again."
Jeju Taxi Tour,"Punctual , Driver speak basic english and is very patient. Drive us to different locations and also try to get discount for us at the tourist locations"
Jeju Private Tour,"I've was allocated two drivers for my trip. Mr Ko Su Hong was our driver cum guide for most of the time while the last 2 days was Mr Kim Sun Nam.Mr Ko was able to speak some English & was generally more fluent in conversing with Chinese. He had helped us took lots of nice and fun pictures during our trip and brought us to nice local places for our meals. He would stop along the way to show us some unique/picturesque spots on Jeju. He even treated us to grilled squid & even bought cough med for me upon knowing I was coughing badly during the trip & made sure i took the med timely. He would always accompany us throughout the walk/trek making sure that we are safe. Mr Ko had really made this Jeju trip a really enjoyable one for me and my family.Mr Kim, I understand that he is able to converse fluently in Japanese. However, he was not able to converse in English or Chinese which made the communication for the last two days rather challenging for us and throughout the journey. Nevertheless, Mr Kim was rather nice and accommodating also.All in all, it was a great experience with Jeju NY Taxi Tour. However, it would be much better if 1 guide can follow the group through the whole tour instead of having to re-adapt to a new guide half way or towards the end of the tour. Also, the the language capability of the guide/driver should be taken more importantly to ensure a better match to the group's need so as to avoid any communication barrier that would discount the fun of the trip. "
Jeju Island taxi tour ,"We planned a stay at Jeju Island for 4 days and at first we wanted to rent a car for sightseeing ourselves. But we cancelled the rental car and we ended up booking this taxi tour. The tour guide also explained a lot about the Korean trend why tourists and locals are travelling to Jeju Island, very nice! This your was really amazing. We traveled around on a sunny day and took some beautiful pictures. It was a great experience and it definitely met our expectations. We enjoyed it a lot! Thank you Mr. Big Dragon! "
Seongsan Ilchulbong Transfer,Mr Sing was very interesting. The walk along Ilchulbong was interesting and we especially loved seeing the Lady Divers. Thank you Mr Sing!
Excellent Service and Hassle Free,"We were a group of 5 and I searched the internet for private minivan tour/hire for 2 full days. It was our first time to the island so we did not know where to visit and so we did not have any itinerary to provide. I wrote to a few car hire or tour companies and most of them asked me for my itinerary before I could confirm the booking. I told them that all I wanted was to book a minivan for 2 days (8 hours each) and for them to show us around and we were quite happy to leave the agency to recommend and to customise the “tour”. I provided our arrival details and accommodation address and fully recognized that we would not be able to cover many sights given the size of the island. I informed all the companies that we would be quite happy to go with their suggestions and cover just 2 or 3 places3 (more if time permitted) each day, and that cost was not an issue. A couple of companies kept asking for itinerary but I simply could not provide anything (because we had never been there) other than to state the pick up and drop off locations and timing for both days. Lucas was the only one who did not insist on an itinerary and even provided some suggestions beforehand so that we could check out the suggestions on the internet before our arrival. He was prompt and responsive in communication. He also checked with me periodically before the trip whether I had any questions. I also arranged airport transfers with Lucas. The drivers were punctual (early in fact) for all appointments and Lucas also checked with me each time to ensure that we were picked up on time. The driver (who spoke basic English) for our 2 day private tour was helpful and even helped us not just to take some photos, but edited some of the photos he had taken on his cameras. His photos and editing tuned out really good and he even printed some of them as souvenirs for us apart from sending the digital copies to our whatsapp. Service was excellent and the booking/reservation was made very easy. No hesitation to recommend Lucas (Nam Yang) Taxi for your local transport needs at Jeju. "
