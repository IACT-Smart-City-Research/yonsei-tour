Shopping,A lot of varity goods and very cheap. From there it is possible to take place Lotte and Bupyeon station.
Small shopping mall / markets attached to train station,"These markets are the usual small shop experience with all the normal fare but with a uniquely Korean feel. Underground for the most part, they go on for ever. Good easy fun, jump off at Bupyeong Station and shop for a few hours. Good fun"
