French masterpieces on display,"They had French drawings and sculptures on display, those which are masterpieces by Monet, Rodin Renior and many other great artists were displayed at the museum. Entrance fee is 10,000â‚© per person."
Check the time table,"They have different exhibits, some even showcase works of art by young local students. Do check out the time table for the exhibitions and they also have piano or musical performances, also need to check the dates."
Small one,"Not that Jeju Museum of Art was a disappointment, just that it was a small place to see limited collection."
Time for an upgrade,"The erotic and exotic art sculptures are interesting and daring but a bit dated.I think the museum has already operated since 20 over years ago based on our driver's comments. It sure is time to undergo an overhaul to spice up the place with digital technology, 3D virtual arts, and robots."
Inexpensive and interesting art museum,"Located next to ""Loveland"", this museum is small, modern place with beautiful outdoor features such as a reflecting pool, sculptures, and a small surrounding forest. There was a little bit of everything, from an exhibit about a famous national artist who lived for decades on Jeju to an interesting video and poetry collaboration of Korean rappers talking about social issues. The upstairs is currently showcasing drawings and sculptures made by Korean schoolchildren in a surprisingly cheeky, cheerful exhibit. Much of the museum was in English, but others were only in Korean. The price of admission was only 1,000 won, well worth it for the experience. There were several pieces that didn't wow me and some outdoor floorboards that need repairs, but all in all, this is a nice little museum. Make sure to drop by the cafe on the way out for a lovely view of the reflecting pool outside as you sip your coffee!"
"Not a bad little museum for 1,000 KRW","This museum isn't very large, and in the winter you don't really want to go outside to admire the small amount of outdoor exhibits (which you can do from inside the windows anyway), but it's got enough interesting art to be worth 1,000 KRW, which is about USD $0.80. For one, I enjoyed the Chang Ri Seok exhibit, as his paintings are very earthy. The second floor exhibit was under renovation when I went, but still, for 1,000 won, I have no complaints about the first floor's contents. The gift shop is pretty underwhelming, though."
