Famous temple built on the Rocky hillside on the sea. Lots of steps but worth it. Monks do live there.,"Scenery just beautiful.Some of the stones are a bit difficult to use.. be careful. No wheel chairs,, no elevators."
Amazing temple,This temple is a great place to visit to experience Korean culture and history. We really enjoyed our visit and you can take great pictures here. 
One of a kind,There are many temples and shrines throughout Asia but none is like this. It is massive in size and spectacularly beautiful since it is built into the mountainside with the ocean waves crashing below. There is truly nothing like it and that's why it is always so crowded.
Magnificent but crowded place,"Lots of tour groups spoil this magnificent place. Access is best done using the tourist bus loops. The walking along the seaside approach is beautiful. On site, there is simply too many people in a relatively small place. One can only imagine the beauty of this temple when the horde of tourists are gone..."
Iconic understated temple.,Easy and short taxi from Haeuande beach.15 minutes ride . Short walk from carpark and serene view of sea and temple. Very busy with tourists but monks prayers made it magical and serene. A must visit and top site for Busan.
Temple by the sea,"A unique combination of temple, rocks, and sea. Get into the spiritual mood, see the inner workings of a great temple. There's a nice food court outside"
Weekends are too busy ,"Don’t come on a weekend it is soooo busy you can’t move, I cam there at 10am and was far too busy to enjoy the great scenery and temple! "
A must visit temple in Busan,"A walking distance to reach the entrance of the temple and you wont get hungry here as alot of dishes and snacks along the way to reach the temple.For those not convenient to walk, not advisable to come here as the staircase is the most headache. The scenery is superb nice and very cooling when visit on Oct. Alot of Korean praying in the temple and very clean as well."
A must see in Busang,This beautiful temple is perched on the hillside and offer a half a day worth of sightseeing. It is located on the other side of the oceanographic institute of Busan so you may combine them in one single visit. The view on the ocean is beautiful on the upper levels. Take the stairways going up all the way and you can go back on foot to your hopon hopoff bus which stops only at the institute. There are lots of people visiting this place so you may want to go early to avoid the big crowd.
Worth a visit ,"Temple set on the rocks is with a visit, but you only need about 30 minutes. Easiest easy to ge there and back is by taxi which is about 15-20 minutes from Haeundae."
Temple in the seaside of Busan,"Unique temple, since its is situated in the seaside.Place is crowded during our visit. I has narrow stairs. Also we have limited time so we weren't able to explore the whole place."
Highlight,"Take Line 2 to Haeundae Station. From Exit 7, take Bus 181 and get off at Yonggungsa Temple approx 20 minutes later.There will be a stone post that indicates the direction of the temple. Walk uphill for another 10 minutes to get to the temple.Crowded as it may be, but a must to visit if you have the time for the temple is unlike others - situated by the seaside."
Stunning views,"Incredible experience, it is tourist spot so it gets very crowded but nice walk to the temple and plenty of eats along the way to try. It has lot of narrow steps for beware for elderly visitors."
Crowded Sunday,"We catched a taxi from Cheongsapo costing less then Krw 8k to get there. Taxi is relatively inexpensive to travel around visiting places of interest for a group of 4 and it saves valuable time. We visited this temple on a Sunday morning which was a mistake as it was crowded with local tourists and workshippers. There are many shops selling souvenirs and food stuff leading to the temple entrance. We actually have to queue to get into the temple. It was just too crowded to really admire the temple built along the rocky shoreline. In actual, the temple is not as beautiful as in the photo brochure.From here, it is a Krw4k taxi ride to Lotte Outlet Dongbusan"
The most beautiful temple in South Korea,"Wow! So beautiful, I was humbled to be in such a sacred place. Loved that it was between the mountain and the sea."
Beautiful temple,"It is one of the top sights for us in Busan. Try to avoid public holidays or weekends, if you can as it will be crowded. We were there on a cloudy weekday in late afternoon, so it wasn't too crowded.It was also quite easy to reach by public transport but expect a 10 mins walk from the bus stop to the temple.There are quite a few food outlets outside the temple, although expect mainly street food. It is a beautiful temple although I am not sure that it is the most beautiful in Korea, as some claim it to be. For those seeking extra blessings to avoid motor vehicle accidents or get better marks in school, there are a couple of spots in the temple for that. Keep an eye for them!"
"Nice temple, but crowded ","The temple itself calls itself the best in South-Korea, but this is a bit of a overstated claim. Yes, the setting near the sea is great and you can certainly come to peace here if it weren’t for the hordes of tourist that visit this place.It’s a bit hard to reach from the city as you have to get on the right bus (tourist info at the metro station can help you with this) but it’s certainly worth the trip out here. "
Lived Up to Its name,"The temple was a quick walk from the Hilton Busan.It is situated overlooking the ocean, and with all the colors and the beautiful cliffs it does fit for one of the most photogenic temples I have been to.If one is staying closer to Busan proper it might take a bit to get to the temple, but if you have the time it is well worth checking out.I recommend this place."
HBH incredibly crowded Temple,We visited as part of a cruise ship tour. We did not know that it was a public holiday. The Temple position clinging to the cliffs down 180 steps is surely magnificent if you could actually move around down there! Firstly we found that the car park toilet facilities were closed! Those down in the Temple had 20 minute queues! [our guides time estimate]. Fascinating temple and walkways but the serenity totally ruined by the hundreds of visitors. Descending and ascending crocodile fashion down very rough worn stone steps. Take care with health and safety issues.
A unique and beautiful temple,We took an unconventional route there from what we'd read online. It's quite an easy train journey and then 30 minute walk from the station via a Lotte Mall where there are lots of shops and restaurants. Rather than doing a hop-on-hop-off bus or full day tour it's much more cost effective and time effective to just take yourself there. It's free to go in and look around and the most beautiful view is located down lots of steps so bare this in mind for walking back up again!
Beautiful Temple,"This would have to be one of the most beautiful temple I have ever see , if you are in Busan it’s a must visit This temple is in such a amazing position facing the ocean , n beautifully built with lots of history, can easily spend few hour here , because it’s up the rocky hill , there are lots of step to climb "
A jewel in South Korea,"Sunny morning, sea cliffs, wonderful sceneries. Metro station Haeundae, bus 100, 181 - 15 minutes walk. Weekdays ok, weekends overcrowded."
"Amazing locale, unique location","This place has a stunning view that we have never seen before in numerous other temple visits, very tranquille yet majestic.We recommend tossing the coin at the bridge for luck and fun.The temple is very near Lotte Premium outlet."
Temple by the sea. Amazing views. ,Came on a Sunday morning. Sadly It was already packed with locals and tourist. Strongly recommend to come earlier if you want to explore more The views are stunning and it’s definitely worth the travel if you have time in Busan 
Awesome temple,This temples location is what makes it unique. It right next to the sea on a cliff. Its one of the most unique temples I've visited in Asia and well worth the visit. Note that the bus does not stop at the temple entrance and you may want to just take taxi out there from Haeundae. Its nor very expensive and saves you a long bus ride and walk.
Most unique temple location,We stopped here on a day tour of Busan and I’m glad they took us there! It’s difficult to get to from the city but so worth it!!! The most unique temple location! The temple itself is pretty generic but where it’s set is breath taking! 
Haedong Yonggung Temple,"It's nice and beautiful to take photo. We went there on a mid Sunday morning, so many people but not crowded.It was easy to get there. We rode bus #100 going there from Haeundae station and #181 going back to Haeundae Station. From the bus stop, We walked around 20 mins. to the entrance of the temple. That part was a bit tiring because it was hot that time."
Temple by The Sea ,"Known as the most beautiful temple in Korea, it doesn’t disappoint at all. This temple is located by the sea making it Insta-worthy. The entrance is free. You can also have light snacking before or after entering the temple as there are local stalls along the way. "
What a stunning temple ,We visited on our last day in Busan and we were not disappointed.A beautiful temple set in a stunning backdrop. The temple juts out of the cliffs. Definitely worth a trip.
Photo friendly,Beautiful temple on cliffs overlooking the ocean. Free to visit and worth it just for the photos. Great food stall market at the entrance for snacks before or after.
Touring Busan ,"The temple is also called “Temple by the sea” another great tour even though short, because it was our last morning in Busan before heading to lunch at the Shinsegae city center and then to board the bullet train back to Seoul. Again, don’t miss this tour it is a beautiful place. Our walk to the temple was interesting as well. There were vendors with everything imaginable Budda related items/keepsake for sale. We saw one vendor wising herself a great sale day by chanting and rubbing 50,000 Won over her merchandise and I followed the same vein by giving baby Budda a bath when I went onto the temple grounds ( this means that I am now cleanse) and ready all my good fortune. We were so relaxed here. Don’t miss the Budda sitting in fire, it’s a spectacular site. I would definitely put this temple on my list to do a more in-depth tour on my next trip. Some pics below. "
Typhoon came to this Beautiful Temple by the Coast,"We were in Busan for 3 days and 2 were rainy days. Omg! Then when we decided to visit this temple, it was rainning so heavy that it blew our umbrella to the other direction. Fierce winds and heavy rain, as we were already there, we decide to brave the stormy weather. We bought a plastic raincoat but did not help much. Floor to temple ground was wet and slippery. Dont think any crazy tourists like us fighting the heavy rain to get to the most beautiful temple in the korea!It was along the ocean and so beautiful. We love it even though we were soaking wet, both shoes and socks. Pants were wet too. We tell ourselves nothing will stop us. So we go against the strong wind. Beautiful temple with buddhas, goodess of mercy and 2 very cute golden pigs. Architecture is so nice inside the temple, the exterior is very scenic. You can walk along but because of heavy rain, we did not walk too far."
 Beautiful temple near roaring sea,"Would have rated a 5 but do feel like it’s a place that lots of tourists visit. For a good reason. Beautiful temple, like many are, but what makes this one unique is the location. "
Cool but very touristy,"When in Busan I would say this is a must-see. However, the location is far from the centre. Beautiful views but a bit of a walk from the drop off points. The Golden Buddha is worth seeing as well"
Temple with a view,A beautiful temple along the shore is a call for must-visit. A unique place of experience with an awesome view.
The Temple by the Sea,"Haedong Yonggung Temple is one of the most impressive Buddhist temples in South Korea and, for sure, one of the must-see site in Busan.It is really famous beacause of its magnificient view, but, prepare yourself: this temple is always crowded!There is a plaque that reads ""the most beautiful temple in South Korea"", but I d' not agree. In my opinion it is in the second position, after Bulguksa in Gyeongju."
Very nice temple ,"It is very nice temple near the sea. It was very crowded when we went there. Easy to go by bus. After bus, you need to walk for a while. "
Best view of the sea,"Beautiful. Wear comfortable shoes bc the stone steps are uneven/slippery. If you are a party of three or more, taking the taxi evened out to the metro price if you are less than 10 miles away and more advantageous. Ours was six miles away and taxi to there was $9 USD. And much quicker. Taxi drops you off at the entrance. Bus stop will make you walk a bit of a distance. There are souvenirs and street food by the entrance. YOU NEED THE ADDRESS IN KOREAN TO SHOW TO TAXI DRIVERS. 86, Yonggung-gil, Gijang-eup, Gijang-gun, Busan부산광역시 기장군 기장읍 용궁길 86"
can't miss this,"I've been to temples all over china and japan but this one is completely unique, even if much of it was rebuilt in modern times. It's full of quiet graces (and people, unfortunately) so you shouldn't leave Busan without seeing it. 90 minutes is probably enough, but one could well linger. Avoid week ends."
Temple by the sea,The temple on the sea is an amazing structure perched as close to the sea as possible. There are lots of steps and lots of stalls. Interesting to see but not as serene and spiritually satisfying as other temples. Perhaps that’s due to the commercialisation that you walk through to the temple. 
"Beautiful sight, must see","Easily accessible from central Busan by train and bus or taxi, this temple was a delight to walk through. The closest train station is Haeundae Station. You can visit the temple and Haeundae Beach on the same day."
Must see temple when visiting Busan,"Absolutely beautiful temple beside the sea. One of the most beautiful temples in South Korea. It takes about a couple of hours to see the temple and take pictures. It is a little far away if you are staying in the Seomyeon area and it could take 1.5 hours by metro and bus. The bus stop to the temple is a 10-15 min walk to the temple. We took a taxi to save time and taxi takes approximately 25-30 min. Also don't miss tasting the sikhye or sweet fermented rice drink and hotteok, tasty sweet stuffed with nuts - at the stalls leading to the temple."
"Nice location, not the most impressive temple","This visit was part of a tour and the location is unique, along the coast.However, in terms of the temple, there wasn't much to see."
Great location at edge of sea,Lots of steps to climb with lots of people around. Be careful. Interesting walk up to entrance and good views
Beautiful spot,"Amazing Buddhist temple on the coast just outside Busan. Got up early, grabbed a taxi and headed in to see the sun rise over the ocean from here. Made for a great morning and then wandered around the temple itself."
Scenic and very interesting. Worth the trip.,"A decent, 15-minute mostly uphill walk from the local bus stop. (We got a taxi to the nearby Lotte Mall afterwards). Amazing temple."
Beautiful Temple by the sea,Very scenic and near to the outlet mall which you can visit it after the temple.There is a bus that goes to the temple and about 10-15min walk to the temple from the bus stop.
Exceptional,"Very nice. It needs a body capacity to ride the ladder many ... Still, the beauty of the view is great. "
my dream trip to Busan,"I took the fast train from Jiji, South Korea to Busan. There in 2 hours. Then took the bus to the temple. Bus 100. It was breath taking. Walking shoes are a must. Lots of coffee shops and snacks to be had along the way. They are building a state of the art Outlets right at the bottom of the hill that you have to walk up when visiting the temple. "
Beautiful Temple,"Everything was beautiful. Well worth the visit. Fantastic views of the ocean, beautiful sculptures. If you want to see beautiful cultural places, this has to be on your list. Do bring a camera and good shoes. You'll want to take many photos and there are a lot of stairs. Be ready. If its hot bring water. If its rainy, bring appropriate gear. Make sure to go all the way to the top to see the Buddha of Mercy overlooking the rest. There are some shops and a market along the road, so plenty of opportunities to grab stuff, too. Make sure you have Won, though, as cards are not accepted in most places."
Very good,Cool place ..make sure you have good food ware .lots of steps and lots of things to see .early mornings are better times to visit .
A must to visit : Best view and very beautiful temple with no entrance fee,"I visited this temple during my business trip to Busan.I stayed at Haeundae Hotel and challenged myself by taking bus to this temple. With a 15-20 minutes walk up to reach the temple gate, the most beautiful temple located at the sea shore cliff with cool breeze was really refreshing.There are street vendors on the way while I walked in the temple. They are delicious and the sellers are very friendly.I will definitely be back here again on my next visit to Busan.Please note that this place is not friendly with people on wheelchair. It locate on the cliff and visitors need to walk on steep and steps up and down."
Beautiful,"The sign at the entrance says 'South Korea's most beautiful temple's so it's clearly worth visiting! The location is beautiful. The complex is larger than I thought it would be with lots to see. We really enjoyed it as even though you do eventually get 'templed out' ,this one is different as it has the location too. To get there, we took the subway line 2 to Haeundae (also nice things to see there) and then when we came out of the station at exit 7, cross the road to the middle of the road and the bus stop is on your left, take bus '181', the temple stop was called out in English on the bus but we were also tracking our whereabouts on Google maps to be sure! From the bus stop it's about 15 minute walk which is well signposted and easy to find. Well worth a visit."
Yonggung Temple,"Set against a breathtaking backdrop by the sea, this temple is a must see if you're visiting Busan culturally. The temple is majestic with lots of figurines of Buddha, the 12 Zodiac Animals, and the 18 Loh Han. Make 3 wishes as you bathe the small Buddha figurine located in the center. Walk around and explore the magnificent placement of the Temple. Enjoy the fresh air. And try the 'Hodduk' dessert which is simply yummy."
Beautiful temple worth visiting in Busan,"We loved this temple because it was in a stunning setting and was easy to explore. We had a chuckle at the Buddha for “academic achievement”. Even though we saw multiple other temples during our trip to HK and Korea, my family agreed that this one was our favorite."
"Beautiful setting, ok temple.","The setting itself is gorgeous, we came on a rainy day and even on a rainy day we saw how beautiful the setting was.The temple is a bit far from downtown Busan and it will cost quite a bit with taxi. If you are comfortable with buses, maybe go that way if you want to save a few bucks. There are a few shops on the way tot he temple from the parking,nothing to write home about.The temple is free which is great.A lot of stairs and it is narrow and crowded so if you have a hard time walking and have bad knees, this could be a bit of an issue. it is not wheelchair accessible. For having visited temples in China, Tibet and Japan, this one is nothing special. What makes this place special is the setting next to the sea. The views are gorgeous. We enjoyed the trip there, plan a couple of hours max."
Beautiful temple,"The temple is next to the sea, breathtaking view from the top. A lot of climbing narrow steep steps, just need to be careful if traveling with senior folks. Recommended for photo enthusiast , tourist. Besides,there were food and drink stalls on the way to the temple. We bought grill squids on the way down from the temple. The lady selling the squid was really friendly . Will definitely visit the place again for peace of mind and the view."
Beautiful Temple,"This was a lovely temple, we took the bus from Haeundae, and then walked up the road to the entrance, once in the temple it can be very busy, we visited on a Sunday, but we were still able to get round and take photo's such a beautiful place."
Temple,Beautiful temple on side of a cliff. There are 108 steps down to the temple and some are very steep. I have COPD so walking up stairs is hard for me so I only went halfway down but there was a nice viewing area and a large gold statue of a Buddhist saint. My husband went all the way down and saw the temple. He said there were more steps up to another area with more statues. We were exhausted after climbing back up
About 200 steps - but worth the walk,"We went there in the morning from Hongdae. Took about 40 mins by bus, then a 10 uphill walk and then about 200 steps. Free entry, spent about 40 mins looking around, the temple is beautiful. The only thing is we were in Hongdae, and had plans to see Jalagji market and the temple. and both are in opposite directions, so plan you day accordingly."
Amazing to see,"From Busan city, take the blue line to Osiria train station, then tske a taxi for ₩5,000. ($4.50).  Free entrance. This temple is located by the water with beautiful view. "
"Beautiful, small, crowded","It's a lovely little jewel next to the sea. The ocean dazzles and oodles of people jostle for selfies. The statue of the goddess of mercy towers over all. There are a variety of buddhas. When I was there, signage announced a buddha for traffic safety, and another for academic achievement.It's a long journey, there are not many English signs. And it's too crowded for what it is.Maybe it's because I grew up next to the sea. It was nice sure, but I couldn't understand why so many tour buses came.I suggest you go early in the morning if you really need to. I hiked there. So enjoyed a long pleasant walk along the sea, and arrived with the first tour buses. But felt completely overwhelmed by the time the fourth tour bus arrived. It's much smaller than the pictures make it out to be."
picture perfect,"the sea, horizon and view was breathtaking. unfortunately, it rained when we were walking in to the temple. it steps and slopes were very slippery. despite of the rain, the view was fantastic. the surroundings of the temple are clean and scenic too. the temple lives up to its name of the most beautiful temple in Korea. there are many little shops along the way if you are keen in getting some souvenirs...however, they cost more here."
Stunning!,"I love this place so badly! Beautiful spot, breathtaking view, great place for photos. I will be back there for sure!"
Really Pretty,"It’s referred to as the most beautiful temple in Korea.... its the only one I’ve been to, but the fact it sets on the rocky shore it is certainly eye-popping... fun photography place"
Temple with a scenic view,It is a beautiful temple. A place to visit not only for buddhists.There are rows of shops before entering the temple. There's a statue/sculpture near to the entrance of the temple which is for praying for safety for those who drive.
A serene temple by the sea,The location of the temple is really unique as most temples in Korea are in the mountains but this temple us by the sea. There is also a traffic Buddha to watch over drivers and a medicine Buddha for good health. The view of the sea is calming and gives the feeling of serenity.
Idyliic Temple by the Sea,"The temple was located on a bluff overlooking the ocean and it was truly a scenic setting. From the parking lot, where our taxi dropped us off, we walked by a number of food stalls before reaching a pagoda like building. From there we headed down a set of steps which gave us the best vantage point across from the temple to take our photos.As we crossed the bridge to the temple, it was a popular stopping point to make a wish and try to get your coins into a couple of large bowls below. Not too many people made it in but we tried our best.We visited the main temple and all of the other buildings including the tiny underground grotto. A reclining and seated golden Buddhas were some of the highlights. There also was a set of stairs off to the left of the temple buildings and at the top was a nice view of the water.When we left the temple, we decided to walk back to the main road and visit the outlet mall a few blocks away."
One of the most beautiful temple,This is one of the most beautiful temple with deep cultural roots. High recommended for all to visit. You can visit the nearby Lotte Premium outlet store after this.
A Rare Temple,Right on the ocean this temple is Amazing. A very different experience. Serenity with waves and the crashing of water on rocks...very peaceful. This was out of the way but worth the trip.
Temple in the rocks next to the sea,There is a car park here free of charge. To get to the temple you walk through a section with loads of sellers of souvenirs and street food. We tried the squid and it was excellent. The temple has a fair amount of steps which aren’t so bad but maybe slippy if it rains. The temple is beautiful - there are a few sections to it each laid out within the rocks. It’s location next to the sea makes it beautiful. Some fabulous statues.We had a great time exploring.
Beautiful yet crowded,"Amazing spot a gorgeous temple, but mornings are the best time to soak in the ambiance of the temple.... afternoons are horrible.. if you check a surf forecast big waves make for some dramatic photos! "
Nice temple,"Nice temple with great views.We found it to be very relaxing.Behind the temple,there is a row of shops that sells local products and food."
A Stunning Temple,"Visited here on a dull rainy day, there are lots of steps here and sensible comfy shoes were needed as the steps were a little slippery in the rain.This Temple and it’s surroundings are just beautiful, the views from the lower level looking upwards made some for some amazing photo opportunities. There are many areas and something to see in all the little nooks and crannies. There are great statues all around the walkways. The walk down from the car park is lined with very large Zodiac statues and street food stalls which gave us an interesting look at the food stuffs close up!"
Temple ,This temple is nearby the waterside and had very nice view.But because we are going there in Saturday so crowed of people. But still nice to go there and spent some time for visiting 
Breathtaking Seaside Temple,"Just a 5 minutes walk from the carpark, then you will be able to visit this beautiful temple that built on the coast. Try to visit this temple during weekdays to avoid crowd as the walking path is narrow and steep. Worth the visit. Great place to take some nice photos. No entry fees was required."
Beautiful Temple by the sea,"Is truly the most beautiful temple in Korea. There were a lot of people when we visited, but it was not too crowded. The view was really amazing. This is a place not to be missed when in Busan."
Worth a visit,"This temple was only about 15 minutes walk from our hotel, the Hilton . The temple is built on the coast and is very picturesque. Definitely worth a visit"
Great temple,"This is a beautiful temple, and the scenery is amazing. The temple was packed with tourists so we had to line up pretty much all the way through the temple."
Stunning & Worth the Trip,"I came here on my own on the Busan City Tour bus (their version of hop on hop off bus) while I was visiting Busan for the day. It’s a doable trip as it took just over 1.5 hours one way from the main train terminal to the temple. You start off with the red bus and transfer over to the blue bus at stop #9. Get off at stop #6 (Fisheries Science Museum/Haedong Yonggungsa). Walk along the side of the white building towards the beach and you will eventually see a sign pointing right to the temple. It’s about a 15 minute walk along the seaside to the temple. Haedong Yonggungsa temple was built in 1376. One of 3 main Buddhist pilgrimage sites of Korea. There are 12 zodiac figures along the walkway at the top. There are steps leading to the various levels of the temple. If you love taking photos, this is the place. The steps aren’t too steep but not a wheelchair friendly place. The bus runs every 30 minutes in a loop. When you leave, go back to the same bus stop, and take the blue line bus to stop 10 (Busan Museum) and transfer to the red line where it takes you back to the main Busan train station."
Interesting Site with beautiful views,"Went here on a full day tour with Here Korea Travel through Viator. What a beautiful temple it was with a lot of history and beautiful views. This temple is considered to be an ocean temple rather than a mountain temple so you do have to go down about 108 steps to get to the bottom. And what goes down, must come up!! There are handrails though and stops along the way.,so it was doable even for someone like me who has physical limitations. Out of all the temples I've been to in Asia, this one was the best one and a must see."
Holy and scenic Buddhist temple,"The 14th century temple is built on a cliff facing the Ocean. On entrance to the temple complex one can see the 12 big Zodiac Stone Figures and an eight story Pagoda There are a lot of steps to the main temple . On the way one can see the wishing pond and a statue of the golden Buddha. Midway down the 108 steps one can stop and enjoy the calming sounds of the waves,The Temple is worth visiting"
Beautiful Buddhist Temple !!,"Considered to be one of the most beautiful temples in Busan because of its almost unique location on the coast; the temple is connected to the legend of a great sea goddess and its position boasts a dramatic rocky background.So it's a steep path down to the temple, with numerous steps but more than worth the effort in order to enjoy the stunning location."
Spectacular views,A beautiful temple with lots of interesting statues. Loved the fact it is balanced on the edge of the cliff.
Unique seaside temple,Go prepared with comfy walking shoes.. lots of uneven steps to navigate. Travelling with young kids meant that we have to carry them at some points to climb back up.
Beautiful place to visit.,"The Budist shine is situated by the sea down a fairly long walkway, but is well worth the effort when you arrive and take in this awesome place."
Beautiful Scenery,The Temple is situated near the sea front with beautiful scenery . It is convenient to go by bus. There are stalls selling local snacks and food. 
Access to this Temple,"If you do want to visit this Temple by the seafront, I suggest that you take a cab there as the access by public bus means you will have to walk for about 20 minutes from the bus stop. And this spoilt the fun of visiting this temple. Be prepared to climb many steps at the temple. "
Haedong Yonggung temple,One of the most beautiful temples in Korea.Location: in Gi Jang but close from Haeun Dae BeachTransport: bus or taxiIt has the connected road to Ananti & Hilton Resort so after visiting the temple and easily go to the resort. Beautiful sea side walk.
The most beautiful temple of Korea,It is astonishing. The temple is nested on the rocks near the ocean and is incredibly beautiful. Especially with all the lanterns during the lotus lantern festival! It is a little bit complicated to get there. We went with a tour bus and the temple itself was worth the tour. Otherwise you have to take a bus or hike 4 miles. 
BEAUTIFUL,"This temple is truly amazing and beautiful! Go early, take the bus and walk up, really not a bad walk. However, there are a lot of stairs and some uneven surfaces. Just to caution as it requires some maneuvering and comfortable shoes!! And bring your selfie stick!!"
Overcrowded and so-so,"Went here as part of a package tour in Jan 2019. I really don’t understand what is the attraction here apart from the fact that the temple is by the sea. Tourists throng the whole place and there is no peaceful vibe. If you’re here to worship, meditate or be calm, you’ll be disappointed. The views of the sea aren’t great either. The only “attraction” is the shops lining the path up to the temple. There are restaurants, food stalls and souvenir shops. Commercialised."
Not to be missed,"If you come to Busan you must visit this temple. Set on the ocean about 15 minutes north of haeundae beach . I caught a taxi about $10 as there is no subway this direction. Cherry blossoms out everywhere ( didn't expect that). The temple is located over quite a large area on the side of the ocean. Was built in the 13th century. Preparations were underway for Buddhas birthday so lanterns everywhere. The statues, temples are amazing and quite a spectacular location. There is a lot of walking and lots of stairs. I must have done hundreds of stairs while I was there. Small market stalls close to entrance food coffee and restroom facilities easy to find. This is a must for Busan!"
Temple visit,They are keeping it clean. Only local food available. Place is like a circle path that guides you through. There are rocks and uneven surfaces. It is family friendly but not accessible for wheelchairs. 
Beautiful temple ,Lots of steps up and down but well worth the effort. Look all around because there is a lot to see other than the main Buddha statue.
Amazing temple by the sea,This temple is one of its kind. Beautiful and not so crowded in the morning. A must-seen in Busan. It’s easier to take a taxi from the subway station because no public transportation is available by the site. There are also many souvenir shops around. 
best temple in korea,best temple in korea right on the sea cliff with some amazing breathtaking views. Far from the city though and quite a walk from the closest bus station
Wonderful location - mediocre temple,"In comparison to many other temples in the larger Busan area, this one falls short in terms of looks. It has a sign claiming to be the most beautiful temple but we found that apart from the special location there was nothing quite special about it. It gets very crowded at certain times and the area surrounding the temple can not be called very authentic. It is worth a visit if you have the time to spare but we found several other temples much more attractive and elaborate. A tip for a short side trip: driving back to Busan you pass a local beach where there is a lot of windsurfing. It is much less developed than the two well known beaches of Busan but this one was peaceful and a nice place to have a cup of coffee"
The only sea side Buddhist temple in South Korea,"The temple has a tall history, first built in 1376, rebuilt in 1930 as it was destroyed by the Japanese. The temple is a big complex on a rocky sea coast and it has been looked after well. Very popular with locals and tourist alike. Selfie brigade gives a feeling as if you are in a tourist spot rather than a place of worship. Interesting to know that only 15.5% of population in South Korea are Buddhist . . . . ."
Hard to access with limited mobility,Very impressive view of a temple on the sea rocks. If you have limited mobility please reconsider as it is a long long walk from the bus stop (no subway ) lots of stone cut steps and climbing up and down.
Extraordinary Temple,"Aside from the crowds that you can expect on a nice day, a visit to this temple is magical. Not only is the temple beautiful, but the location is stunning. Set aside the sea, every turn you make brings to light another stunning view. To be able to see this beautiful religious sanctuary is a thrill and virtually everyone was appropriately respectful.The only downside of a visit here could be the crowds. We went just as the cherry blossoms were blooming and that just added to the crowd scene. Regardless, take your time, bring a camera and count your blessings for being at such a magnificent site."
Unique rock temple ,Mostly korean temple are on Mountain You can feel different peace Many statues have stories so good for kids 
Too crowded at weekend ,"When visited this temple, we dont expect too much people. We don’t realize it was weekend (everyday are weekend for a traveller LOL). From the main road, We need to hike to get to the temple complex. And more stairs in the temple. Many stalls along the way to the temple area. They sell foods(many eomuk-fish cake, roasted squid, beatles that I don’t know and don’t wanna try, candy like snack, raw dried food, vegetables, etc), drinks, and souvenirs.The view of the temple is not as good as the photos maybe because it was too crowded so hard to take a good picture. There are 12 zodiac statues, kwan im goddess figure carved on stone, little gautama statue that everyone splash 3 times, two big cute pigs statue, big kwan in goddess statue (different from the one that carved on stone), sleeping buddha statue, and other temple buildings. We can throw coins to bowl under the side of a bridge. We dont visit all side of this temple area since it was too crowded."
Beautiful,"The location it's so unique for a temple,it's worth to visit.If go early in the morning it's not that crowded."
Beautiful Seaside Temple,"If you are staying in Busan and want to visit a temple, choose Yonggungsa. It's unique in that it is one of the only seaside temples in Korea. As a tourist, the easiest and most affordable way to go there is to take a bus. From the subway line, get off of Haeundae Station Exit 7. Look for the closest bus station and get on Bus 181. The drive takes about 45 minutes. Get off at the Yonggungsa Temple Bus Stop, and from there, it's about a 10 minute walk to the temple.Before the temple are different food and souvenir stands. Depending on the day, the actual temple can get really crowded, so plan to go on a weekday. Also, make sure the weather is clear and sunny! I went during a rainy afternoon, but the pictures I took of the temple were still quite beautiful. Admission is free."
Amazing ,Some cherry blossom still around at the beginning of April. You have to walk through a street of stalls with food and souvenirs but to buy any you need Korean currency. Then there are over 100 steps down. You can see Buddhas and beautiful buildings and lots of lanterns. There are also miniature Buddhas. It is all very colourful and unusual because the temple is by the sea. The place certainly exceeded our expectations by a long way. 
far from town centre,this place is reachable by taking the bus but the journey took about one hour plus from Busan Station. Be prepared to walk a lot going up and climbing down the stairs. some parts of the temple is under construction and inaccesible. 
Beautiful,"Easy to reach from Haeundae Station then a walk up the path, there is a market in between where you can taste local product and buy drinks.Prior the temple there is a walk with statue of the Chinese zodiac, beautiful.Even though there are so many people everyone follow some kind of etiquette, probably a religious thing, and everyone is quiet. Enjoy the silence.Walking up the staircases you get to see a breathtaking sea coast view, I personally sat there and enjoyed the sea breeze while watching the waves hit the the mountain's walls. So peaceful, must see in Busan."
Beautiful temple,"This temple is very close to Haeundae Beach and we got here via the City tour bus (hop on, hop off). The location on the coastline is stunning and it is best to come early because it gets very crowded. There are a few vedors that sell all sorts of snacks just outside the temple but if you want ""western type"" food, you hvae limited options (coffee, packaged ice cream, hot dog on a stick with rice cakes)... but many Korean street food to choose from like grilled squid, dumplings, fishcakes, deokbokki, heottduk (fried pankcakes filled iwth brown sugar and cinnamon or a mixture of seeds and nuts - so good!), grilled meat skewars. This requires quite a bit of stairclimbinh nad the path isn't perfectly smooth so wear comfortable shoes nad hang on to small children."
Just Amazing,To this day I think it is one of the most charming places in which it was possible for me to be. I was there twice and it made a huge impression on me every time. quite hard to get there but it's really worth seeing! absolutely amazing views combined with a mantra in the background makes impression
BREATHTAKING VIEW,The view is amazing that could be express by words. A must visit place in Busan. Easy to acsess by public transport.
Temple next to the sea,I have been there three times and there is a market before entering the main entrance of the temple. You can try some local street food there as well. You can feel the calmness when you visit the temple.
One of My Favorite Temples,"I have visited several temples in Korea, but this is by far one of my favorite ones. Unlike other temples that are located up in the mountains, this one is seaside. It's a bit of a trip from the main areas of Busan, but I believe it is worth it. The temple is beautiful and the views out over the ocean are amazing. The zodiac statues are cool to take pictures of that are on your way to the main part of the temple. There is even a little market set up outside the entrance to the temple where you can buy little trinkets, food, and drinks. Defintely a great place to take some amazing photos."
Serene and beautiful,"A serene temple set in beautiful surroundings, a chance for quiet comtemplation. Well worth a visit."
景色のいいお寺さんです。,地下鉄海雲台駅からバス（２コース有り）約４０分くらいで海東龍宮寺の入り口に到着。坂を上って約５分くらいしましたら駐車場やお店が見えてきます。お寺の入り口近くまではお店が有ります。十二支の像や観音様の像もあります。通常は左側の入り口から階段（108段）を降りて行くらしいですが、お正月で観光客が多くて私たちのときは右側の出口の方から下り坂を降りていきました。すごい人でした。海岸（岩山）にある景色のいい場所と黄金の像があって縁起がいいと思いました。I thought that there is a scenic place in the coast (rocky mountain) and a statue of gold and it is good luck.
Beautiful Temple to visit while in Busan,"The temple is quite a way outside of Busan, but luckily we had hired a car with a driver for the day and this was our last stop. We spent about an hour and a half here and we all really just enjoyed taking our time and taking some pictures. This was the only temple we had time to see while in Busan. There are concrete temple animal figures, gold statues, and you can also see and hear chants."
Has that Oriental look and feel,"The temple and its surroundings were very well maintained, clean and tidy. Interesting figurines and statues but since the descriptions/plaques are in Korean, we have no comprehension of what the history or background of these status are about...."
Unusual temple by the sea,"This temple is a nice stroll from the Fisheries Center, where the bus lets you get off. You can see people diving for seafood off the rocks. Probably one of the more interesting temples I've been to. "
Cliff Side Temple of Beauty,"This temple outside of Busan along the sea is one of the most breathtaking temple complexes I have ever been to. There are 108 steps to climb in the temple area, past large Buddhas, stunning views of the sea. Something very special to experience even if you think you are templed out."
Beautiful Temple,"Amazing active temple on the ocean. There is not too much to see, so only plan about 45 to walk around the area and soaking in the views. "
A Unique temple,"This rare temple built by the sea, is one of the major tourist spot in Busan.Not only does it attract the tourists, but also draws lot of local population as many believe that praying here ensures their wish come true.The best way to get here is to take a Subway and alight at Haeundae station.Take a bus from the stop which is just opposite to Subway station.However if you are using the public transport, then be ready to walk a little bit more as it is a long walk from the main entrance to the temple Complex. The 12 Zodiac signs greet you at the entrance of the temple complex and one needs to get down the cellar like cave to view the unique Buddhist sanctum. There is also a Pagoda with four lions in front of the main sanctuary.Set aside at least four hours for this visit and don’t forget to wear a comfortable show if you want to enjoy the visit."
Temple by the sea,It was one of the must visit place in busan as it was one of the temple that was located by the sea instead of mountain or hill. It was very crowded with the locals as well as tourist. It is Buddhist temple but guess most people went there as tourist spot. Nonetheless it was worth the visit.
Would love to be a monk by the sea,"One of only a few seaside Buddhist temples in So Korea (most of the others are all in the mountains). Really a lovely place. Lots of steps, and views from multiple directions. Well worth visiting."
Nice temple in Busan ,"It was a beautiful temple built along the seaside. Claimed to be one of the lost beautiful temple in korea. Prepare to walk and climbed with stairs. Lots of different temple and Buddha inside to pray for different purposes. Study god , give birth to Son god and merciless god... getting into this temple is very inconvenient and probably take a taxi for first timer visiting here. Else, you can take a train and then bus to this location. However, still need to walk from the the main road. Capture beautiful picture from the peak and hearing the sound of the sea ! Nice place to spend time strolling around. "
Just temple with some local food,"Since we intend to go Lotte mall premium outlet, we decided to drop by one of the famous temple in Busan.Temple is located around the sea so there’s scenery is beautiful.From temple to lottemall, either by walk or take a taxi which will cost you about 3300 won."
Beauty in the mountains facing the sea,A great day spent at this peaceful sight. Who would have thought to build a temple at this gulf with the backdrop of the mountains so many centuries ago? Magnificent!
Beautiful temple ,"We loved our visit to this temple. The steps leading from the temple are quite narrow and steep, so easier to take small children in carrier than a stroller. There’s a lot of beautiful buildings and a wonderful view of the sea. Take you time and enjoy watching pray. There’s lots of food and souvenirs in front of the entrance. Skip the souvenirs as they are way over priced. Get them at Gamcheon culture village instead. "
No doubts about it,Certainly the most beautiful in Korea. A lovely attraction to enjoy. Many scenic shots to capture the moments. Do expect crowds and take precautions on the steep stairs. It a little long way off but it presents an excuse to visit the Premium Outlet nearby. 
How to thrive at Haedong Yonggung Temple,Go during a holiday to see 1000 of people (or go when it's a bit slower).Walk over the the nearby village for a slice of real Korean life.Visit the nearby restaurants for great Korean food.
Walk around to explore and take in the sights,"We visited this temple on a Sunday afternoon. We used a combination of subway and public bus and it took us a while to get there. One good thing is that the buses announce the stop and it was easy to identify the bus stop to get off.From the bus stop, it’s a 5 to 10 min walk to the temple. Closer to the temple, there were many stalls selling snacks and street food, as well as souvenirs.Before reaching the temple, you will walk past the 12 animals in the zodiac before reaching it. The views are beautiful and I would suggest walking around to explore and take in the sights.However, do note that there are quite a few steps and may be a little challenging for those who have problems walking. "
The Most Beautiful Temple in Korea,"it was quite far from the city center, it took me almost 1,5 hours to get there and i had to walk another 15 minutes. it was really beautiful sight. you should be there early in the morning so there won't be so many people"
Very crowded,"We visited on a Sunday because it was the only day we could and it was a big mistake. Temple was packed with visitors, with a traffic jam from the highway turn til the parking lot. Interesting to see a buddhist temple next to the sea instead of the usual mountainous spots, but would recommend to go on a weekday or altogether skip it if you only have a couple days in Busan."
This is an AWESOME AND AMAZING PLACE,"I am so happy I went to visit this amazing temple. The views are Wow! The place is not very big. The buildings are well- preserved and the entire place regardless of the amount of local and international tourists visiting it is kept clean including the toilets. The views are incredible. The pagoda is small but has an unique design. The gift shop inside of the temple has competitive-prices better than the ones outside but it does not accept credit cards nor foreign currency. Out side they accept US$ at a convenient exchange for them, but not that bad."
Calm and peaceful,"One of the nicest temples I have been, not just because of the architecture of the temple but also the nature landscape around the temple. There isn't much to do here but it's still quite worth a visit if you enjoy architecture. "
Seaside temple,"This temple has one of the most impressive location for temple, located at seaside with beautiful sea shore view. The temple per se has nothing impressive with the main temple and surrounding temples with average buddha statues like in Japan and China. The view from the platform at the left turn before entering the main temple area has a great view of the temple. On the way to the temple there are many shops selling local food. "
A 'must-see' temple in Korea!,Situated north of Haeundae Beach Haedong Temple is a photographer's delight. Besides being an iconic Buddhist temple you could spend hours here at the markets or examining the art and architecture of the buildings. Thoroughly enjoyed my visit here and would recommend this above many other temples I have seen in Korea!
Beautiful temple with seaview,Visited on day tour of Busan. Very serene & peaceful with the sea breeze. We came on the evening on a weekday and it was crowded. Cant imagine on weekends!
Beautiful coastal temple,"Wonderful temple! The setting is just beautiful, it's a wonderful feeling to walk down the steps and see the sea, rocks and buildings appear before you. We visited Haedong Tonggungsa close to closing time & it was far less crowded than the photos we have seen, so it was a great time to visit. We went at about 4:30pm one day in early November, and stayed for about 30 minutes. We got a taxi from Haeundae metro station, which was easier than catching the bus."
Temple with seaview,I visited here via day tour. There are many sculptures and stunning seaview there. I think foreigners will appreciate the temple. 
Dont forget to go to the OUTLET MALL,"A historical tourist attraction with beautiful seaside! Avoid weekends as it might by flooded by locals. There are convenience stores, cafes and restaurants. Expect a good 10mins walk from the main road :)Yes, don't forget to go to the Lotte Outlet Mall located just a bus stop away! We bought a few pairs of Adidas shoes at half price! Lots of food and brands to shop from. "
Claimed to be the most beautiful temple in Korea,"A very touristy temple to visit, with typical small shops lining the street leading to temple, hence be prepared for space jostling with fellow visitors. No entrance fee and donations are welcomed. Claimed to be the most beautiful temple in Korea, but it is subjective. It is definitely interesting with the many man-made statues, artefacts, landscaping nesting amongst the natural coast with great sea view. After the temple visit, the hugh Lotte Mall is only a short distance away."
Beautiful,"The most beautiful temple I've seen while visiting South Korea. The location on the cliff by the water is stunning, and the atmosphere there is so peaceful even when it's crowded with people."
Temple by the sea,"Very crowded during weekends, avoid if possible. If u are going on your own, it takes about 15 mins to walk to the temple from the main road. Worth the visit if you have the time on hand, it takes about 1.5 hrs to get there from Busan station. Would recommend you walk in following the temple big signage and walk out via the trail towards the maritime museum. Besides the temple, nothing else to visit there."
Scenic Temple near the Ocean!,"Haedong Yonggung Temple was on my list of attractions to visit near Busan. From Haeundae area, I took a bus which was somewhat quick and inexpensive. Before arriving at the temple, there are several shops and food stalls with interesting foods to sample. When I got to the temple, I walked left to walk the coastline a bit and get views of the temple from a distance, makes for great photos. One negative thing I found was the beach is very dirty and full of trash. Would be nice if they took better care of the beach and ocean here. I went back to the temple, and loved the peaceful setting here and the buildings, statues, and monuments. Just being here, you feel at peace. The temple and surrounding views are just beautiful."
The most beautiful temple in Korea," From Haeundae subway Station, you can either take bus or taxi. I take bus 100 from Haeundae station to this temple. From the temple bus station, you need to walk around 600m to reach the entrance of the temple. "
Temple by the Sea,"It is a unique place to see , with a stunning temple and Golden buddha facing the ocean. There were crowds when we went there because it was Sunday. At the temple entrance there are lots of food stalls souvenir items that you can buy and some clothes to shop also. Their is a giftshop at the Temple but they are expensive. Be prepare to walk and climb stairs when you go there, thats the only way you can enjoy the view of this Beautiful Temple.. "
Tagline 'Most beautiful temple in Korea',"We came here using BUTI bus tour. The bus stop us at the Fisheries museum & took us a leisure walk of only 10minutes to reach the temple. Nice walk along the coast. From far, we can see the temple by the cliff side. Very scenic view & great photo ops. It was crowded but still bearable as we came in the afternoon. Nice place"
Mesmerizing Temple ,"strategically located on the cliffs overlooking the open sea, loved the scenic view, the 12 Zodiac Stone Statues and the Wishing Pond. "
Crowded,"A wonderful temple right on the sea. We arrived very early in the morning but by 11am it was so crowded it was difficult to move around. Would definitely recommend, but go early."
Directions from Cruise terminal,"just as quick reference for directions to the temple - we used metro up to Haeundae station and took a taxi (cost 9000 won)... it is slightly cheaper to take the taxi from Jangsan. refer to photo for directions. This temple seems extremely popular, so planning the trip early in the day (or later if you want to catch sunset). many tourist attractions seem to be around Haeundae area, so more flexibility to plan your day."
One of a kind Buddha Temple.,"The temple was built in 1376. Destroyed and restored after the Japanese war. It is built by the east sea in Gijang, Busan and one of a kind to be built so. This is a popular tourist destination with convenient buses and taxis from Haeundae bus/metro stations.Lot of street food, snacks to try on at the entrance of the temple. It is a huge complex built by the cliffs and offers greatviews of the ocean. It could be crowded most of the time, free of charge to enter and experience buddhist way of life.So, get your cameras and start clicking, everywhere you turn is a photo-op. Be aware & mindful on outerwear as it could get windy."
Lovely temple by the sea-built 1376,"We took public transportation, which means more walking however the weather was agreeable and we enjoyed the exercise. A rather large complex. It gets rather busy.There are vendors selling snacks before you enter...we enjoyed a hot fresh fried dough that was filled with caramelized sugar/cinnamon and seeds."
Temple by the beach,"Went there thru an organized tour, which was a good idea as compared to my friends who used public transportation to get there. According to them, there was a lot of uphill walking involved and their feet got tired when they got to the temple already.Also, choose another day except the weekends as the crowd of families tends to go there for the weekends."
Cute temple away from the centre ,"This temple has been a real discovery to me. Very cute, it is a must see if you are going to Busan ! A bit hard to access (you have to take different buses), it is really worth it, regarding the beauty of the place. "
Pretty little temple next to the sea,"This temple had been top on my list for visiting & it was definitely worth the battle with other tourists. This temple had a constant stream of people and tour groups visiting but don’t let this put you off, it is still worth the effort. As you park up, you can’t miss the little alley with all the street snacks and souvenir shops, you have to pass through this alley to get to the temple and when it’s busy it can be a pain as it’s narrow.....however we got a good day as we went when it had been raining and there seemed to be less people than usual. This temple is a replica of the original as the original was destroyed by the Japanese in the 16th century but rebuilt in the 30s. This temple is pretty large and there are many areas to take photos, the underground mystery water fountain has little queues of people lining up to drink. Some features are a little garish like the pigs and the gold Buddha but that adds to the charm of the place as it’s a mix of old and new. On your way back out do try the hot cakes, which is like a grilled pancake with sugar filling....one of the best I’ve tried and perfect after wandering around the temple on a cool wet day. There is also a seating area at the top next to convenience store and more eateries if you buy lots of food and want to chill, we found this area a lovely hang out space when the sun appeared late afternoon. "
Beautiful temple right on the coast,Some steep walking but worth the effort. So much to see with stone statues and gold Buddha. Temple buildings with beautiful vibrant colors. A must see when visiting the Busan area. 
Impressive temple by the coast but heavy walking (108 steps),"The temple itself is very impressive and beautiful. To get there requires a walk of 108 steps. Going down is not a problem and is a leisurely walk. Coming backiup is a tough walk if you are not in shape. The temple offers many interesting statues including the statues of their zodiac calendar. Statues abound all around the temple grounds the history of the monks, and the Buddhists history. There are statues of Buddhas dressed to mark academic achievement. There are statues that hold a bowl and you can pitch a coin into one of them and if successful you can make a wish. The highlight of the temple is the great Golden Buddha. There is a replica of monks sitting on the side of a mountain learning their spiritual lessons. This is really a site that should not be missed while visiting Busan, South Korea."
Impressive,"Great exoeriance, lots of statues on the way, Buddist temple, was lucky to watch the ceremony, worth to walk up the hill to explore the view or approach the sea level"
Temple along the coastline,Beautiful temple situated along the coastline. Weather is great. You can enjoy the sea breeze when you are at the top. Be prepare for some walking up and down flight of stairs
Interesting!,"Temple is interesting as it is along the shoreline. The walk to the temple requires a lot of climbing so be prepared, "
Very glad this was on our itinerary,"With just one day in Busan we had to make a tough decision about what to see and what to leave out. I'm not usually a big fan of temples so this site was not a high priority. However due to the relative ease of getting there from our Hotel (1 bus from very near the Haeundae Grand Hotel) we ended up choosing Haedong Yonggungsa as our main activity for the day. The 139 bus took about 45 minutes and dropped us a short walk from the Temple. It was pretty easy to navkgate...the bus had English electronic signboard for only few of the stops (Im guessing just the tourist ones). The Temple was one of the stops that the bus signboard displayed. Thsy also announce it in Korean but on only our 2nd day in the country it was hard to catch what was being said. So we were glad to have the signboard.The bus driver was a little impatient with us for not having the correct fare ready and for asking if this was the bus to Haedong Yonggungsa. I think we were holding him up and things are very punctual in Korea. Once at the Temple we felt like we were having an experience. There are market stalls linong the path to the temple, with lots of delicious (and some very interesting) things to eat and drink. All so kitsch type souvenirs....probably a mixture of trash or treasure, depending on your taste. Our kids 4 & 7 loved all the stalls.There are also some really interesting stone statues on the short walk to the temple, and there are also some short forest trails.The Temple itself was beautiful and we took some lovely pictures of the kind of Korean scenery we were hoping for.Look out for the place, near the pedestrian bridge,where the sea rushes up a channel to wash over the black rocks, it makes a really beautiful and soothing sound."
The best temple I even seen!,"It’s the most beautiful temple that I saw in my life. Because it’s stay on the rocks, and you can see the wonderful sea, waves..So amazing nature making atmosphere in the temple unbelievable. I really recommend to visit this place. You must to see it!"
"Spectacular, and best Hotteok nearby that I've tried","During Chuseok, we took a good 1.5 hours to get here from Seomyeon, and probably more on the way back. We took bus 100 from Haeundae station, and the traffic in Busan can be very bad. The place is very inaccessible, but it's worth the trek. The temple looks incredible because it's right by the sea, but the actual temple itself is like any other temple in South Korea that we have seen. We had the best Hotteok at one of the stalls near the entrance. I highly recommend it, and still am thinking about it!!"
Sort of a hit and miss,"Went on a rainy day. Took the public transportation here and it took nearly 2 hours to get here. It is a long walk up the slope before hitting the temple entrance, and lots of steps to get onto the main temple grounds. Can be slippery on a rainy day. It has a nice ambience and definitely located on a place that is different to most temples. Worth a trip if one is into temples and architecture however could have better spent my time doing something else as this place is really quite far. "
Pretty ,"Located by the sea and has an awesome view. It’s a temple with monks and it’s pretty decent. Obviously a tourist attraction and hardly able to get any nice pictures due to number of tourist. A lot of food and souvenirs for sale along the way in and the circular, red bean inside thingy taste awesome! Cost you 2000won for 8 pieces. "
Like a normal temple ,"The temple is just like the ordinary ones in Asia countries, but with a sea view from the top and the decorations in the temple was not bad for photoshoots. If you would like to have some photos, worthwhile to visit this temple in Busan. "
Nice!,A nice temple not far from Huandae beach . We took the bus there and spent an hour. The view is nice but the temple itself is not anything super special. On a nice day and if you have time to kill its worth going but you do not need to go out of your way to see it. 
Beautiful Seaside Temple,This is a must see. It is beautifully located by the ocean and is the only temple build in Korea that is located next to the water. The waves crashing into the rugged rocks makes for great scenic shots.
Excellent - Avoid the Crowds!,"We went to visit the temple in mid-afternoon in the middle of Chuseok, the Korean Thanksgiving, and boy was it crowded. We arrived via the bus and it was quite crowded, and then walked about 10 minutes down a road toward the temple. At the entrance, there are many folks selling food and souvenirs out of stands. The temple itself was large and beautiful - a lot of different areas to explore. There is a neat little forest walk off to the right at the entrance that is easy to miss if you aren't looking for it. On the way back, we decided to go down the road one bus stop to avoid the big crowd at the main bus stop, and it paid off - our bus ride back was more comfortable as a result!If we were to do it over again, we would probably arrive early in the morning so as to avoid the crowds. It may be less crowded on other days, but it's quite a well-known tourist attraction so arriving early will likely be a good idea!"
The Highlight of Busan,"We were used the local bus to get to the temple which was easy and will save you a lot, once we got there it was pretty special, the waves crashing on the rocks below and the monk chanting swept you away from your day to day worries. Whilst the buildings were not pristine they were real and authentic and had a real warmth about them. A must do for anyone travelling to Busan."
One of the highlights of Busan,"We took Metro Line 2 to Haeundae Station and then took bus 181 (about 20min ride). It is imperative that your download Naver Maps as it will give you all the transport options.Once you get off your stop, it still about a 10-15min walk to the temple. At the entrance there's convenience stores and your street food vendors.It was quite busy, but a few locations to walk around and take photos. On the actual temple there are toilet facilities.Expect a few crowds!There's a few set of stairs but nothing to challenging (IMO)."
"Very beautiful view, not clear hiking trails","The temple itself and the views are very beautiful. Absolutely a must see, free entrance. A well known tourist attraction. I read that it also includes nice hiking trails, which I wanted to explore. All signs for the trails I've found were in korean, and I also didn't find a map of the trails, neither an information booth. So couldn't really take any hiking trail.But still worth visit! Only a bit more than 1hr reach from Busan center by public transport. "
Very very crowded,The temple it's self was really beautiful but the day I went it turned out to be so so so crowded the were ques a d lines everywhere so I couldn't really relax or take many pictures as I felt like I couldn't stop. It took longer to drive there than the total time we spent there overallLovely temple next time I'm in busan I will probably go and pray to Buddha that it's no where near as crowded
Unique temple,"Most of the Buddhist temples in Korea are situated in mountain setting. This one is unique, which is right by the sea . The view is magnificent! It’s worth the trip. One downfall is it has lots of steps, which is not too friendly to older people who has knee troubles. Going up and steps were brutal!"
different seaside temple,"The temple and grounds are ok and different as they are on the cliff side of the ocean, but not as good as I expected. A lot further out from the city than we were led to believe and once there it is a very long walk maybe almost a km along the path to the temple and rather crowded too."
This is an interesting sight that is set on the Sea of Korea--as it is called here,"I did not realize the animosity between Japan and South Korea ran so deep, but there certainly is some disagreement over everything--WW II did not help the situation! The South Korean tour guides are very vocal in their dislike. So much so that he called the sea you stand over at the Temple The Sea of Korea instead of the Sea of Japan! Bitter politics aside, this is an interesting stop, but not a great stop--being so incredibly crowded did not enhance my review rating. There were people EVERYWHERE! Just walking was a real challenge and some of the narrow paths were outright dangerous--we saw two falls.The walk through the market area is very interesting--they are selling everything imaginable that you are supposed to eat. We recognized only a few dishes, but passed on them. The only currency acceptable is local--no dollars or yen unless the purchase is very small. We did by some strange snacks for a couple of dollars. The vendors are friendly, but there is a real language barrier. The Temple is filled with many sights and sculptures. The buildings are decent, but not great. The views over the water are pretty. The pathways are a little difficult to follow (to figure out where it will take you), but you will get the hang of it soon enough.This is not a ""must see"" venue, but it will be memorable."
Beautiful setting for a temple,"This temple is a short walk from the Hilton Busan. Do not waste time with the shuttle bus if the staff suggest so, they did not seem to be aware of the coastal path that takes you straight to the temple via a much quieter and beautiful seaside route. The temple is definitely worth a visit as the setting is gorgeous. There is a small shop selling candles and other religious artefacts but also tourist souvenirs are for sale. Also a small tea shop type of thing seemed to be in operation when we visited. If you are staying at the Hilton this is a must visit sight!"
Not a must see,"We came to Haedong Yonggungsa (Dragon temple of the eastern sea) for a change because it's the only temple in SK features a seaside location. Unfortunately, this is also the only feature of this place.The view of the sea is nice, but not much different from any other seaside spots in Busan. The temple ground is small, the buildings ordinary and unattractive, the golden pigs, coin throwing pounds, statute for giving birth to a boy etc are way too commercialised. It's quite crowded and thus noisy even on a weekday. It certainly does not offer tranquility and peace. Fortunately there's no entry fee.The walking path leading to the temple is full of street food stalls. It's kind of more rewarding than the temple itself."
Magnificent Ocean View!,"Nice temple by the sea. Full view of blue ocean & sky.Was caught by the text written on the ground ""天下大明地，一到万福来“ that's really awesome if u understand what it means.Weather is very hot in Aug about 34 degree so come prepared!From Haeundae station exit 7 took bus no. 9, 100 or 181, alight at Yonggungsa temple, walk about 15 - 20 min min to reach. Once reach the area, you will see some shops & food stalls. Temple is located down the steps, just next to the sea!If you stay in Westin hotel, can take taxi directly instead more convenient & hassle free, price not much different. We went there by bus & back to station by taxi as we want to try bus.Great place to explore!"
An amazing experience ,This place is simply amazing and so worth your time. The path is just so rewarding and the place has a special feel that gets you to be at peace 
Visit,"It was one of the prettiest sight ...the temple was so beautiful as expected but the location is breathtaking..there is a way from the fisheries which is exactly where our bus dropped us but it's not marked properly and there are no signs in English. It would be better if they could write some directions in English as though people are very friendly , it's difficult for them to understand and explain.. though I must say they really try.. lovely people"
Beautiful location ,"The Temple is located at a beautiful spot with a tranquil location and feel. We were on the BUTI hop on hop off tour which drops you to the fisheries institute. The Temple is just a 500 mt walk along the water on a lovely walkway. The walkway is a bit difficult to find as there are no English signage. We ended up walking 1.2 kms from the main road as thats what the map showed. The walkway starts just next to the cafeteria, and its beautiful once you locate it."
One of the most beautiful temples I have seen so far in my 2 years living in Korea.,"This temple was on my list for a long time, due to fog and other things random issues, I didn't get to visit until a year and 8 months into my stay in Korea. It was worth the wait and will not be my only visit. This is the first attraction I tell anyone about when they visit Busan. It has everything you want: cliff-side beauty, many places for selfies, tradition, ongoing prayers you can see in real time, beautiful artwork, cherry blossoms when in season, lanterns when in season, a giant golden Buddha. I cannot recommend this place enough. Truly a sight to behold if you are interested in historical landmarks. "
Beautiful Buddhist temple on the coast (great morning or afternoon trip from Busan),"Learned about Yonggung Temple from photos I saw on Instagram. It's as beautiful as the photos, situated on the rocks up against the sea in Busan. An easy bus ride (about 30-40 min) from Haeundae Beach. Highly recommend a visit if you are interested in history or Buddhist culture or just want a break from downtown and would like to see something beautiful. My only gripe, though this is a problem with my planning and not the location, was that we went mid-afternoon and the place was packed with other tourists. I'd like to go back for another visit and get there first thing in the morning to avoid the crowds. Imagine it's a much more peaceful place with fewer people. Free entrance."
Nice place to relax and pray,"If you are in Busan , is compulsory to visit this temple , very nice scenery , cool weather , clean and most important fell peace full."
What a view!!,Took a bus from Haeundae while visiting there. It was a walk to the temple but it was breathtaking once we arrived there and worth the walk. We arrived around 10:30AM with few crowds but started getting very crowded as we were leaving. It’s exactly as is in the pictures and few more photo spots. There are many tent shops with street foods and shops for souvenir along the way to the entrance. There’s also a shop inside the temple for Buddhist bracelets and such. Also a place to purchase a roof for the temple. Temple on a beautiful beach setting is well worth a visit.
Haedong Yonggung Temple,"Temple that oversea the sea, with very nice view and nice cool breeze from the sea (even though it was very hot when I was there). But the temple is quite far away to get to and was crowded when I was there as well"
Beautifully breathtaking,"Haedong Yonggungsa is one of the few temples that is built on a cliff facing the sea. It was built by a monk who wanted harmony between the sea and mountains. There is a small food street with stalls, cafes and one or two restaurants directly outside the temple. We took Bus 100 from Haeundae Metro station directly to the temple, followed by a short hike to reach the place.Enjoyed the experience a lot as it felt very different from the usual temples that we visited. The ocean backdrop adds to the beauty of the temple and I just felt really calm and serene during my visit. The entire scenery itself was breathtaking. I enjoyed exploring the different parts of the temple and taking pictures of it. I also enjoyed the cooling evening sea breeze. The whole place just gives off a very zen vibe.Totally must visit. Be sure to drop by before 5pm because most of the food stalls outside closes then. Would imagine that morning is the liveliest for the temple. Also wear comfortable shoes as there is a bit of hiking involved."
The best temple that I've ever visit in Korea,One of a kind~ with great view of see... a very big temple that you need atleast 3 hours to see who the temple ...
Nice view but too crowded.,It is nice place to visit but advise not to go on weekend as overly crowded. Quite a far distance and too much time taken by bus. Suggest by taxi though bit of pricey.
The best temple in Korea,"All over the street going to this temple, we can find a lot of delicious street food. and in temple, we will have a nice sea view. NICE!!"
Mesmerizing Haedong Yonggungsa Temple,This is the first ever Temple which I visited that is alongside the seawater that adds more beauty to the destination that attracts more tourist. The nature and temple harmonize beatifully.
Spectacular views by the beach,"This is easily my favourite temple in Busan, and possibly in Korea. The temple is located by the shoreline and offers fantastic views of the beach. Climb up 108 steps of the main attraction of the temple to capture picturesque views of the temple on the rocks. The best time to visit this temple would be during buddha’s birthday as the temple will be adorned with pretty lanterns, the night view is equally stunning too."
Temple on the seaside,The temple is easily accessed by taxis from the metro station. It is a destination on all tour buses and gets quite crowded in the weekends. The way to the temple full of shops selling food and gift items. The temple is colourful and beautiful. Good for a quick visit.
Beautiful,Tho it's a bit crowded with tourists. the scenery was beautiful and peaceful. I really enjoyed the view.
Probabiliy visiting once is enough,I was there with a family of three. I find this place a bit commercialized. The golden statue and the pagoda right at the entrance.
A must visit,"No matter what your religion is, visiting a temple in Korea is recommended. The temple looks into the ocean, very pretty, to the local it is a simple. The walking is not too hard, fitting for everybody."
Beauty by the Sea,"We visited on a very hot, humid day, but that did not take away from this breathe taking temple. There is no charge for admission and there are several paths you can take that reveal another hidden treasure. "
Beautiful buddhist temple at seaside,Must go if you are in Busan. The view there is so beautiful and feel the fresh air. A bit far from the city. I went there by a taxi and back to town by bus. 
Beauty and Peace,"Take the light blue line to OSIRIA Station, walk past the outlet mall to the corner, turn left and walk straight until you see the sign for ""Haedong Younggung Temple""... go up the hill and you will run into the food area. Try all of the delicious street food! For vegans, there is a sweet rice drink (shick-ay), long twisted fried potato on a stick, and hotteokk (fried pancake with seeds and maple syrup inside). Buy some beautiful Buddhist-style bracelets, venture down to the beautiful and serene views. Toss a coin into the water basin and make a wish! This place makes for a perfect sunday. Wear comfy shoes and dress a little bit modestly, it is a sacred place after all."
beautiful places,"One of the beautiful temples,situated on rocks on the shore line-with a view which take you to a dream-land.Very interesting, interesting sculptures on the way to the temple,and inside colored very pleasant for eyes.."
Nice view from the cliffside,"It's a bit of a long journey to get there. Took the metro and bus and another 10 minutes walk to the park. Went there in the morning around 9 and I recommend you to go there in the afternoon to be honest so that by the time you are chilling at the cliffside, the photos would turn out great. The scenery and the temple really compensate the journey distance. Overall its a picturesque spot for you to upload in the social media."
A unique temple by the cliffside,"The public bus-stop is about 8-10 minutes walk into the park where the temple is situated. The walkpath is not very well maintained with overgrown grass and weeds. However the beautiful scenery and the unique temple location compensated for it. The surrounding would have been very peaceful with the chanting on the monks if not for the noisy crowds (especially tour guides speaking loudly).There are many stalls outside selling souvenirs and street food. There is also a 24-hours convenience mart right outside.Overall a must visit, if you're in Haeundae."
Crowds,"The monastery is filled with hawkers and shops trying to sell you things and is not very peaceful. It was filled with people disrupting the peace for the few monks that came. I would recommend visiting because the scenery is beautiful but at the same time, I must warn about the crowds and the number of street vendors stationed right outside the monastery. "
Unique cliffside location.,"We took a taxi because we had read that it is a long walk from the Metro. You must first resist the temptation to stop at every souvenir stand and all those food stalls selling grilled cuttlefish, fried foods, sweets, fruity drinks and other snacks. Save all that for after your trek down to the temple.The next section that you pass has large human-like statues of the Asian Zodiac animals. Then you will walk uneven, sometimes steep steps downwards toward the sea and the temple.There are a few locations where you can take some great photos.Workers were setting up scaffolding when we visited in mid May. Many tours arrived at the same time we did. The temples are nice. If you want to do more walking, you can climb up even higher but the views are not much better. For us, the highlight was finding miniature sets of clay figurines of monks in the little nooks along the cliff."
Worth a visit,This temple was very busy on a Sunday afternoon but definitely worth the drive out. Will go there again at a different time. 
Beautufil temple in Haeundae beach,"The temple located on Haeundae beach. Very beautiful temple on the seaside of Haeundae. So many beautiful photo spots from here.Going to the temple, you will meet some stalls selling foods and drinks. You can find apple size watermelon and they will make juice then put it back inside the watermelon. Nearby there is also lotte mall with the premium factory outlet"
There for the photo,"This place closes at 7pm. If you are a photographer, you might want to be there for the sun set. Other than that, it has they typical oriental architectural design."
Temple with a view,"A nice temple by the sea with a view. The walk to reach the temple could be challenging for old folks and young kids as there are lots of uneven steps. Other than that, it is a pleasant place to walk around and take in the peaceful surrounding. "
Day Trip,This temple sits right at the shore line Busan in South Korea. A place worth visiting.... for both the view and peacefulness. 
Seaside Temple, This is a beautiful temple built on the seaside here in Korea. Most temples are built in the mountains so this one is very unique.
Ordinary temple in nice location ,The key attraction is possibly the location- on the hill near the sea. In all other part it’s quite typical temple.
Wonderful experience but not good for the knees,"We visited the temple after rejecting the science theme park and its gruesome cafe. This was a greqat experience, the temple is set beautifully on the coastal rocks. Its a short walk along coast edge to get there and there is much to see, but there are plenty of stairs, which can be hard on the knees. Piped Buddhist chants at the top level are entrancing, leave at least 2 hours for the visit and watch the time for the buses which get very crowded in late afternoon"
Crowded but lovely location,"On the day I visited this site was overrun with people, and the courtyard areas were covered with scaffolding that I believe was being set up for some sort of celebration. (The scaffolding was hung with hundreds of light bulb sockets.) On another, less crowded day, I might have given this five stars."
One of the few temples by the see,"Picturesque temple located right on the cliff, by the ocean. We visited the temple in the morning and the light was just great at that time of the day. It wasn't too crowded."
Same as before,Not much changes since the last we visited in 2013. The same scaffoldings were seen around temple. They had railings down at the rocks which kind of spoil the view for photo taking.
Amazing,"Amazing place to visit to learn about another religion and to heal the soul.The view of the temple as it sits by the side of the mountain, facing the ocean is u describable.Try your luck in throwing a coin into the wishing bowl, rub the statue of Buddha to grant a son, get to know the 12 animal zodiacs..Directions:.. Haeundae Station.. Exit 7.. Bus 9 or 181.. Alight at Yonggung Temple bus stopYou will need to turn back at the bus stop and walk left, following a road."
Beautiful and peaceful ,"We visited 3 temples on our trip in Korea and this one was the most beautiful. It was a little crowded as we were there a few days before a holiday, but was still quiet and peaceful. It is set on the side of a cliff overlooking the ocean and was built to both blend in and stand out. The day we visited was cloudy and rainy so the temple, rocks, and sky all blended together. Be aware that you have to be able to descend and ascend many stairs to get to the temple. It is worth a visit when you are in Busan."
Buddha's Birthday,"Visited this temple by the sea just as the sun was about to set in Busan. The place was absolutely packed as it was Buddah's birthday celebrations but we managed to find a nice spot overlooking the bridge to the temple. And when the sunset the colourful lanterns where lit up over a starry black sky. There are lots of things to do other than praise Buddha and take scenic photos including eating delicious Korean street food like Korean pancake and tteokbokki (Rice cake), a wishing well, souvenirs and walking trails. And if you show up around lunch time in Buddha's birthday you get a free bibambap lunch but unfortunately I missed the window for this year but maybe next time. The temple is free to visit and I recommend either getting a bus or taxi out to its location."
Worthy adventure! ,This Temple was within walking distance of my hotel. Excellent adventure. Lovely grounds. Outstanding architecture. Very spiritual place. Ocean views were excellent. A definite must do in East Busan.
Great experience ,Happened to visit on Buddha’s birthday! Of course that meant crowds but also a once a year opportunity to see the temple fully dressed! See the accompanying pictures - it was a great experience.Would recommend taking a taxi from the Haeundae metro - this would be the fastest and cheapest option.Lots of food stalls and restaurants on the little road to the temple as well.
Harding Yonggunsa Temple/Fisheries Science Museum,I would not have known where to find this temple. the bus dropped us off at the Fisheries and Science Museum that has picturesque attractions as you pass through across the corner where a path goes along coast to temple. you cannot see from museum until way further the coastal pathway. Best time to go is during celebration of Buddha's birthday where lanterns are decorated as ceiling in temple. 
Popular sightseeing temple,"A rather unique temple next to the sea. Crowded with many tourists and locals. Parking was full even though there is a huge car park outside the entrance. Quite a fun place to visit. With a wishing pool, statues of 12 Chinese horoscope, nice temple architecture. Enjoyable day out for families."
Interesting seaside temple but a madhouse on weekends,A nice photogenic temple by the sea. Lots of interesting things to look at and many different kinds of photo ops. But long lines on the Sunday we went; also it can get very windy even in May. It would be better and less hectic if you can go on a weekday.
Busan,The temple is beautiful. It has a beautiful view and great for pictures. There really is not anything else to do around there. It was about 1:30 on bus to get there from Busan. And we spent around 30 min there and that’s because there was a lot of people. Out side the entrance of the temple there was vendors selling food and Souvenirs.
An overrated attraction,"Besides the lovely location near the sea, the temple is by far the less attractive I've ever seen... kitchy and overrated. If you have already seen a lot of temples you can skip this one."
Average,"It's a bus ride away from Haeundae Station. I felt like the journey to get there by bus and walking in (it's quite a distance) took longer than our actual visit at the Temple. It was not that crowded when we went. The temple itself is pretty, and so is the seaside view but I don't feel like it's worth the effort to travel there unless you're going there to pray."
Very crowded and commercial,"You may take a bus from Haeundae station to reach there and climb a hill, and a lot of steps. The location is nice, the temple as well. However it is very crowded, and looks more like a picnic place."
The Temple is Great! No More!,The temple is old enough to respect. Personally please don't throw coins to those poor turtles! I don't think you would like someone throwing you coins or others right? Nothing more special! Except you like the many steps........
Worth a visit ,"Although it might seem out if the way, this temple is worth a visit. After leaving in Korea for months, and visiting many temples, this one was by far my favourite as it was situated by the water."
Stunning,"Stunning location of this temple by the sea makes for superb photographs. Very scenic. A long way from port so used cruise excursion to get here. Lots of steps but worth it. Very crowded, ideally would go earlier than we did but it did not spoil enjoyment of the amazing site."
Nice temple visit,Must take a taxi. Can ride a public bus but the walk is steep and far to the entrance. Enjoyed the chinese zodiac statues
"Lovely, but very crowded, temple",This is a unique setting for a temple so it is a novelty for sure. The temple is pretty and there are a number of zodiac statues at the entrance. There are a few great spots to get some nice pictures of the complex on the water but it is very crowded and busy. More so than the other temples in town. That said if you are visiting Busan this is probably a site you want to take in.
Beautiful Temple,"It is a beautiful temple built by the seas/ocean [im pretty weak geographically] I am Buddhist and i love the structure and the gold around the temple. Although the place is full of tourist, but it is still beautiful.point: There is very delicious odeng outside the temple."
Amazing ocean view with an old temple!,"Though it is crowded on weekends, there is nothing like this temple with a fantastic seascape! I recommend that visitors should walk from this temple to Songjeong beach."
"Too crowded, 90% rebuilt","Aside from the views, there is nothing special about this tourist destination. We visited on a Saturday afternoon. It was not enjoyable at all to have to wade through crowds and get to the temple walking in single file. Not a must see. The taxi ride over was scenic and it is probably more enjoyable to hike by Songjeong Beach and Dalmaji-Gil neighbourhood."
a lovely sight but very crowded,"Granted we did go on a Saturday and there seemed to be many families there, so I'd go during a weekday. We did it from the City Bus Tour where you walk in from the sea side rather than thru the food/tourist trinket side. Recommend the sea side walk in"
Skip it!,"This is nothing but a commercial tourist site, with the entrance lined with vendors hoping to separate you from your money. Visitors have no respect for what used to be here. Of course this temple was rebuilt in the 1930s and isn't even a good replica, as other rebuilt temples have succeeded in being. The view isn't even very nice, either the Hilton or the fish farms. We left by the forest walk to the beach, about 1.5 kms."
Easy to see temple worth a bus trip,We took bus 181 from the Haeundae beach metro stop area. From the bus stop is a short walk up a hill to the temple. The bus drives through some interesting areas with some sea views. The temple is at a wonderful place next to the ocean. Worth a visit from Busan.
The temple on the coast,"Visited this as part of a cruise trip. Give yourself plenty of time to give this a comprehensive visit you have to allow at least 1.5hrs, be prepared to walk on uneven ground & steep slopes. The Golden budda on the cliff edge & all the surrounding areas need time to enjoy. South Korea is not Japan but does have a certain charm with interesting places to see."
Fabulous,"One of the must visit places in south korea ! Fantastic view, fresh air, healing... I loved everything about this temple ~ I want to go there again and again and again"
Underwhelming place ,It’s brimming with tour buses when we walked in from main road. Took a bus from train station which took around 20-30 mins. The view of the coast line is quite nice but nothing to rave about inside the temple grounds. More for locals to make pilgrimage trip here. There’s a row of shops leading out to the main entrance and you can get nice hotteok and cheese ice cream if you are ip for it. 
Must visit!,"It’s a temple located on a cliff! What’s not to see?? We came here on our own by riding a train from bexco station and went down osiria stop. Then took bus 139 toward the temple. But all public transpo wont take u up the temple. So we had to walk (about 10min) uphill. If you’re not up for a walk, u can take a taxi then. The temple is really nice. Although there were a lot of tourists and had lots of ties to place all the lanterns in prep for the lantern festival on may, it was simply WOW. "
Beautiful location!,"Haedong Temple is located on the coastline and is a site to see! This was also on our bucket list after reading reviews and we were glad we went. The walkway can be challenging for those who are unsteady on their feet and some steps that are quite steep. The location is very serene but during our trip we encountered either middle school or high school students who were very loud and noisy and ruined the atmosphere. Other than that, this temple is a must see!"
Temple by the sea,This is an amazing place to visit though it gets very busy at the weekend. there is a small parking area if you are driving but parking is not free. there is a lot of walking and up and down steps so do keep this in mind when visitingbut def worth visiting! beautiful place especially with the cherry blossom
Temple with gorgeous view of the sea,It was easy to get to this temple via bus from city. The giant Buddha statue alone is worth the visit. Beautiful grounds and lots of photo spots for great holiday shots. 
To see,I have been to busan 3 times but i missed this gem the 2 first times i went n!! Unbelievably pretty temple ^^ a go to in busan ! Easy to reach with a bus. And a 10 min walk after that.
Beautiful temple by the sea but a bit far,"We visited here because many people gave good recommendation. The place a bit far, its about 30 minutes from Haeundae station by bus and then walk for 15 minutes. The temple was nice due to its location by the sea however not that big. It took us about one hour to go around all parts of the temple. If you have limited amount of time and not really into temple, may be can skip this place. "
A true gem,"I lived in Seoul for 18 months and Tokyo for 5 years.. I still get to both countries very routinely for work.Please someone tell the Korean government that most tourists don't care about K-Pop, cosmetics, plastic surgery, or duty free shopping.This place is a stunning temple set into the rocky cliffs above the ocean. It is on par with any of my favorite temples in Japan. It also isn't full of foreign tourists so maybe I shouldn't want to the government to advertise a place like this but it does deserve it!"
Dragon temple by sea,This temple is right on the edge of a rocky shoreline. There are many steps to climb down and of course come back up and they are quite uneven as made of rocks so need good footware if wet. Quite complex so need a friend to show you where the steps lead to; where the best lookout is; and how to get down to the cave for prayer. Dragons are everywhere along with tiny little figurines which nobody could explain to me what they were? The chanting of the sutras can be heard wherever you are in the complex giving the spiritual feeling however there were so many people taking selfies that that feeling dissipated.
Day trip,"Quite long drive from Busan Station (1 hour or so),So many street vendor on the way to the tenple, and track is so steep. Walking down is no problem, but on the way out (going upslope) thats another thing, as many elderly walk reallllly slow.Temple is sitting on the cliff so it has a really nice view. Taking a picture? a bit hard, as too many tourist posing at tge same time, as u wouldnt get a clear panoramic picture, just bunch of selfie sticks.. :)"
My China trip,"Probably one of the highlights in my Asia trip. This temple is breath taking to say the least. Be prepared to walk extensively and be aware there are LOTS of stairs on this stop. Free to enter, so it’s all good, along the way, you walk through a good number of street vendors, perhaps the best food there is, is the Korean pancake at the entrance to the temple when you arrive. "
Interesting Temple on the Ocean.,In a very scenic location. Moderate amount of walking on uneven surfaces. Not very easy for people who have trouble walking.
Temple by the sea ,"Definitely worth a visit for it's spectacular location by the sea - I went in march when there were clear blue skies and big waves. On the path down to the temple there are the usual souvenir stalls, but past that are statues of the Chinese zodiak and then you follow steps down to a bridge, view point and the temple itself. It wasn't too busy when I was there, so you could easily go into the temple and take your time looking at the different carvings and icons. According to the info board, some parts were rebuilt in the 20th century after being destroyed by earlier conflict. It's easy to get to on the blue and yellow loops of the Buti bus tour - tho you have to.walk about 10 mins round the other side of a small hill from the bus stop (at the fisheries museum).If you're a little unsteady on your feet or you're going with small children, take care on the steps to the bridge and goddess statue as some of them are quite steep and uneven."
A beautiful spot,This is a beautiful sea side temple to visit. A great setting and very tranquil to boot.Very unusual to have a sea side temple as they are unusually on a hill.
worth the visit,INteresting visit of heritage place. Even thoguh reconstructed it is worth the visit. On the sea side. We went on a Saturday full of tourists. A marked with good at the netrance
Peacefull place,Aldough the place is crowded during the afternoon its absolutely a must see. Beautifull temple and well maintained!
A Must!,This tample located in the proximity of the sea is a must for Busan travelers... It's just outside city core and easy to access! 
Tranquility,"We went to the Haedong Yonggunsa Temple in the afternoon, its locatded on a rocky sea shore overlooking the sea. Themain temple building is in classic Korean achitecture with tile roof and large timber beams painted with classic motifs. Inside the temple a monk was sounding a beat (with two pieces of timber) every second for the whole time we were there. There are many smaller shrines and dedications on the site. It was very interesting and well worth a visit. Wear comfortable shoes as there are many stone steps."
Beautiful Ocean View,Beautiful surroundings. The view of the temple with the ocean background is beautiful.Lots of snacks & food along the way.NOTE!! the kiosk at the entrance sells a stick of Oden for 2000won!!! You can get the same for 1000won along the way to the temple.
Scenic Backdrop,Lovely walk towards the temple. Good example of Korean architecture. Great cliff and sea backdrop. Worth going.
What an experience!,One of the best attractions in Busan. Well maintained and guests were quite respectful of the significance of the site.
Very beautiful temple along the sea,Breathtaking view of the temple by the sea. The design is also very nice. Peaceful walk. I went on Saturday so it’s very crowded. But still a peaceful experience
More interesting from a distance,"Viewing the temple from the path is more interesting than going inside. I went on a bright but cold day in January and it was mobbed. I imagine it can only be worse in the summer. I'm glad I saw it, but it's not somewhere you'll stay for many minutes. "
Great Place for Sunset,It was a great place. But too far from another busan tourism area. So please take timeIf you wish to visit this place.
great coastline temple,"I really recommended to come early morning, this temple bit crowded at noon. great view and super recommended spot when you visit Busan. so many local food in entrance not too pricey, what a lovely experience in this temple. so beautiful yet calming. "
"Nicely located, VERY crowded","This temple if half an hour by cab from the centre of Busan when there is little traffic, and not so easy to get to by public transportation. It is very crowded. The temple itself is not exceptional but its location is. Overall, I am not sure I would have gone through all the trouble to come here had I known beforehand."
Pretty and worth travelling the distance,The views along the coasts to this temple is really pretty. It is quite a long walk and lots of stairs at this temple.
"Beautiful, but just too many people","Place where so beautiful, but it was so busy. Its is Budism temple, where even Korean people go to pray and with something, As my Korean friends said, mostly for good exam resorts for their children. Entry was for free. There is the street of markets next to territory. "
Amazing,Lots of people when we get there but still we're amazed on how it was creatively created and preserved. The view from the bedrocks is also astonishing.
The dragon palace is located directly at the waterfront,Allegedly all your wishes will be fulfilled if you go there. The loction is very pretty and unusual. It is a busy place with many locals and hardly any tourist.
Haedong Yonggung Temple,"The temple is located on a wonderful cliff. It is out of Busan but you can arrive there by bus or taxi (the latter is cheaper if you are a group of four persons). It is probably the only ""ancient"" monuments. The tour of the temple can be done in less than 2 hours."
"Haedong Yonggung Temple, South Korea","An unusual position for a temple, but it's easy to see why it is here.Some fairly steep steps and paths and can be crowded, but well worth the visit.Markets on site sell a wide range of local foods and souvenirs."
Nice Temple by the Sea,"We were staying in Haeundae so we took Bus 100 to the Haedong Yonggung Temple. The bus ride took about 45 minutes. From the bus stop, it was another 10 minute walk uphill.Entrance is free and there are great views of the sea. We came in the morning and really enjoyed walking around. We spent about half an hour here."
A scenic temple on the cliffs,"It is quite a sight - the temple in the cliffs. Its a bit of trek getting to the temple, but what a great view. Make a wish over the bridge to the entrance of the temple by throwing a coin into the bowls that statues below are holding. "
It was a cold day but it was worth it.,I visited this temple during national day and I recommend you don't do the same mistake. It was crowded and everybody wanted to take photos. The paths along the coast are beautiful and I recommend them. It is a nice place to visit.
Special location of temple ,Nice to visit temple as it is located beside the sea and have a very good view. It would be better if there is bus service available to go up to the hill/temple.
Amazing View,"If you are coming from Haeundae station, exit 7, take bus 181, fare won1,300. You will not miss the stop since so many passengers getting-off on this stop. from there Take a taxi won3,000 or take a 7-10mins walk. I love the view of the ocean, the breeze is quite relaxing. You need to climb a little bit to get much nicer view and need to be careful. The path is not that easy. Not good for people with leg problem"
Soooooo crowded,"We are spending six months in South Korea for work and have been visiting a lot of temples through out our stay. This one is different from many that we've been to as far as the size of the crowds. Most temples are peaceful and pleasant to walk around. At this one we were pushed and shoved the entire time. It was way over crowded. I also did not like walking through a bunch of vendors to get to the temple. Most temples have a gift shop, but this place had street vendors walking in and out. The temple itself and the Buddhas were very impressive and beautiful, but good luck getting a picture without getting pushed."
Dramatic Buddhist temple on the Busan coast,"I visted Haedong Yonggung on a very cold, clear morning, so the bright colored buildings and decorations glistened in the bright sunshine. The path to the temple runs through a market that was fully operational despite the cold. The site offers dramatic views of the Korean coastline, and a striking, yet peaceful complex of elegantly decorated buildings and statuary, with the amplified chanting of Buddhist monks all around you. There are several memorials on the site (to what I couldn't say, as the script was all in formal Korean), but sculpturally they were quite dramatic. One day I'll have to return with a bit more information (and a bit less jetlag) in order to get to know the place better."
Amazing,Can't imagine how the temple be build up in here! amazing and awesome.But the traffic is not really convenient.
Temple,Alot of walk...because of staircase. Not suitable for old folks and wheelchair. Very inconvenience. The temple near to the sea. The wind blow is so relax and fresh. 
Busiest temple," Nice temple due to the location by the sea. It was the busiest temple of Korea I visited, not in a disturbing way. "
Very Beautiful,This place is very beautiful! The temple is settled atop a cliff by the sea. I highly recommend visiting this place. We enjoyed strolling around the area and the view is unique and just beautiful to behold.
 A nice temple in a beautiful setting,This is a lovely place to visit. This is the only temple by the ocean front. Must walk around to all places. We caught a taxi there and back which was better than hiring a taxi for a day.
Stunning but don't go in the am,"I took the bus by myself. It took about 40 minutes. Get off the stop after the Little mall.It was great, a lot to see. It was a sunny morning and the sun was I. My shot. I would have gotten better photos if the sun had been in a different spot."
Great place but overcrowded ,"I came for autumn foliage in Busan. This was a good timing as the weather just turned cold and the leave were turning yellow-red. I visited the temple in the Sunday morning. It was crowded with local Korean people and tourists. I think local Korean family came for prayer and site-seeing. The view was great with the chanting surrounded the entire area. It would be great if there was less people. I couldn’t have a quiet moment to stay still and sink into the chanting as the crowds just pushing me forwards. However, I found a quiet trail which lead to the back of the temple. It was a less taken road and able to view the temple from another side❤️The trip would be a failure if I didn’t explore the trail. "
Really incredible,"This Shiren or Temple is build on the rocks. Is really beutifull, you need a taxi to get there or take one of the city tours, is a really popular place. You can take a taxis to go back to downtown really easy too, they have a parking area if you want to rent a car. Remember if you want to rent a car in South Korea you need an International driver license. You will fine restaurants too out side the Temple."
Looking for sunrise? Here's the place,"Ok, I'm about to update old reviews from tripadvisors about this place.So, if you want to look for a place to see sunrise, this is a nice place to be. It really depends which season you are visiting. Practically, I just visited this place in early November 2017. FYI, sunrise is at 6 am, not 5 am. The temple is really nice to take pictures especially when they start their prayers at 4 am on the dot. Yes, 4 am.I started my journey on foot from Haeundae beach at 3 am because of course, solo trip, no buses around that time. It be easier if you have a car but the ungoldy hour was worth it, I guess.Anyways, since is 3 am, you definitely need a torchlight or light source from your phone because once you reach, you have to walk through an eerie path to the temple if you are trying to catch some pictures of them praying at 4 am. Going solo and as a girl, was pretty scary but adventurous at the same time. Is quite safe actually, just need to be mentally prepared if you are scared of ghost or anything.So yeah, sunrise was at 6 am plus. If you happen to take pictures of them praying, please don't make noise and show some respect. Try not to talk so that you can enjoy the silence and respect those who spend their lives as monks.Oh, and since is autumn, coming up to winter, is very cold at that hour. So, make sure you got extra scarfs or gloves."
What happened?,"The location is magnificent. Many places on the walk in along the shore were closed off with danger tape, including a major bridge. Perhaps this is the result of seas caused by Typhoon Lan. Too many places needed repair and restoration, and much of the restoration has been sloppily done. Stairs, and there are many, are in disrepair or poorly repaired. I had the impression that this was a very poor temple, not able to take care of its splendid art and achitecture. Often, in Korea, toilet paper is served up in gigantic rolls outside the stalls or even outside the whole restroom, as here. Used paper goes in the provided bin. Holders, yes, but no paper here. They sell tissue in the drinks stall and shop, at what seemed like a high price, but there was no hint of that in or near the restrooms. They could have put up a sign! Fortunately, I carry tissue and a handkerchief as a matter of course since my first trip to Asia over 25 years ago. This indicates a lack of organization and dis-spiritedness to me. Also, things smelled evilly in places. There is no reason for this! The art and architecture are gorgeous. The location is incomparable. The stories behind it are illuminating of both the history of Buddhism and the history of Korea, but you won't find those out at the site. There is so much going for this temple, built nearly 1000 years ago, and it seems like something's gone wrong with leadership. Don't let that stop you from going, though. Just remember your own tissue and handkerchief and a couple of packaged wet towels for your hands."
"Amazing, beautiful Buddhist Temple by the Sea","This was perhaps my favorite sightseeing destination during my recent 2-week excursion to Korea. The temple is beautiful, with a surreal setting by the sea. The crowds are not too bad (went in the afternoon) and the temple itself is very well kept up. There are great restaurants and shops outside the entrance (bring cash!). A photographer's dream destination. We didn't have much time in Busan and I'm very glad we chose to come here. "
108 Steps But Not Really a Problem,"Set on the coastal cliff-face this temple is unique in Sth Korea because no other temple is on the coast. Most are hidden in the mountains. The Buddha here is in his large, seated and golden form. There are shops on the walk down and by the temple, for the souvenir conscious visitor. "
"Too many people, but a beautiful","The temple is beautiful. We went on a tour but there were too many people. The day we went there were 6 buses. There were a lot of steps and some on the tour had difficulty getting around. The scenery of the temple was spectacular, the seas were heavy and this added to the spetical."
Beautiful setting for a temple complex,"When we arrived we had no idea of the size of the area. At the top there are statues representing the Chinese zodiac. Fun to find your sign and have a photo with it. The steps go down to a number of different temples and features. There are handrails or ropes to help. The steps are steep and a little uneven in places but easily doo-able, and when you see it the effort is well worth it. There are numerous areas and buildings to see. The views are fabulous with lookouts over the sea. We saw lots of people praying and meditating here. Stunning"
Very nice site on the cliffs,"Getting to the temple involves many steps, some of them steep. At the end it is however worth it, the temple is beautiful on the cliffs and offers a great view of the sea."
Beauty on a hill,"Like most Budhist temples this is on a hill and involves walking up and down many steps. The grounds and gardens are very well maintained and pleasing to the eye. There are lookouts that enable you to get the perfect picture or just to enjoy the scenery as the temple is built over looking an inlet of the ocean. Architecture is typical of the Asian region that it is in and the decorations of the temple complement the building type to perfection. If tall, watch your head through some of the passageways/tunnels. There are shops and market stalls present to buy gifts and an ATM if you need the local currency. Get cash before going to the temple as there are some interesting trinkets to purchase. You will pass a colonnade of images for the year in which you were born. These have an element of cute about them and are worth the picture. Above enjoy an optical experience."
Great visit to a temple on the cliff,"The temple still houses monks and you can see locals visiting this temple paying respect and chanting to the Buddhas and Boddhisattvas. They have a special one altar dedicated to the East Sea Dragon King, which is what the name of the temple means. Great trekking site and also good photos with the cliff and the sea as the backdrop. High recommended."
Favorite temple in Busan,"THIS IS JUST BEAUTIFUL! I really recommend visiting this place. Better if you can do it on a weekday because on weekends is really crowded. But nevertheless, if you only can go on weekend the place is worth it. The nature, the temple, and the sea; perfect mix. Btw the souvenirs there are really expensive you can buy almost the same in other areas for less! "
Interesting place of worship.,"It's a Buddhist temple with beautiful views. One has to walk about 10 minutes from the bus stop to the temple. Along the way, you may be able to take photos of the beautiful scenery."
To-die for View!,"A temple located on a hill by the sea. A very good view! But of course, no pain, no gain. You get to the temple by going down lots of stairs (imagine the way back! LOL). So you have to be in a good condition to travel here.This is actually a temple used by local people to pray. You can pray for academic achievement, or to get a son, and lots of other statues to simbolize the type of pray. But the view attracts tourists to come here."
"Great temple, but oh the crowd..","Go here first thing in the morning! And i mean, FIRST thing in the morning. Come here past 9 am, then be prepared to face the crowd! But the view, the experience, and the temple itself is very much gorgeous. Something about a temple on the edge of the sea is magical."
Mesmerising,The main attraction is the pathway to the temple which even though is slightly narrow increases the level of anxiety as to what is in store on the other side. The view point is good for taking back good memories captured in your mobiles or cameras
Fascinating place,"I've been to quite a few Buddhist temples and this has the unique fact that it is on the edge of the ocean. Lots of cool details, and who doesn't love a big golden Buddha! Easy and cheap to get to using bus 181. Bus 9 took us back to the metro station."
Good for ocean view and praying,"The view from haedong yonggungsa is awesome, I would say the best. Although it was crowded, you still can enjoy the view there. There is a underground place, it was cool but because the holy water, so it's quite wet, just be careful then it will be a great experience."
Wonderful place.. a must visit,"The best temple in Busan with wonderful viewsHow to reach: From haeundae station (line 2) exit 7 - take bus 181 / 100 / 9 — 40 + mins — you will identify the stop where most people get down — wall for 15 mins. Those who prefer to walk less, it is better to take cab.The temple has breathtaking views. Multiple places to take photos. It’s gets windy at the top so get some warm clothes. Can spend easily 2-3 hours here.A must visit place indeed."
Worth a visit.,This was something to do while I was in Busan. It's about 1.5 - 2 hrs away from Busan KTX station. It's a beach side temple. Very nice view. I used Google maps and it was fine getting me here. Bus stops on the main street and from there about a 20 min walk to temple area. Spent about 1-2 hours here before moving on.
beautiful grounds and temple,"This was part of my tour. Beautiful scenery and a nice walk. Lovely seascapes. Fair amount of climbing, so wouldn't advise it if you have ortho issues."
Nice temple but quite far,"The temple is seriously nice but a walking distance of around 10 minutes is required for travelers who take bus. By the time I reached the temple, I was sweating and tired. It's still worth visiting for those who have never been here."
Unique,"Went here as part of scheduled itinerary for Busan bus tour. Interesting spot for a temple, at a seaside. Be prepared to walk up & down about 100 staircases though."
One of the few sea side Temples,"I echo what others say, and if you are going to do just one temple then this one ticks all the boxes. We got to it from the city hop-on-hop-off bus, but there is a car park for those more mobile. Free to go in after a walk along a well made path (steps), heavy gate at the start so I guess they close it an night. Take a few coins to try your luck and gain that free wish (bit like an upkeep donation). Lots of good photo shots. I thought it was busy when I was there, but was told that that was not busy."
Interesting ,Nice place to visit. Beautiful location and statues. Arrived to the place with a local friend. Worth the drive from the city of Busan.
Temple Visit,Two ways on how to get here from Haeundae area: 1. 181 Bus (kwon 1.30/person) more or less 14 stops and will take you roughly 40 minutes and then walk up to the temple. OR2. Take a cab (less than US $20) and you’ll be there in 15 minutes. The temple is pretty small area. We were in and out (took pictures) in less than an hour. There’s a small market (that sells street food) and a restaurant. Totally worth the visit while in Busan.
Australian Travellers,"Consider this to be a ""must see"" as it is a magnificent structure facing the sea. From the entrance it is necessary to descend the steps to a lower level to view the temple itself and then ascend the steps to the next level to view the statues and scenery out over the rocks to the ocean. As you can tell there are about 108 steps in all and if you navigate all of them you will live a long life!! ( or be exhausted!) it is well worth the effort as all through the grounds are ornate statues, especially the large golden Buddha. Don't miss a visit!"
Unmissable,"Must visit. Location and setting make it a perfect picture postcard place to visit, but the temple itself isn't stunning like others in Korea.Take ba 181 right by exit 7 at Heaundae subway station and stop by the main road where your walk up to the temple will start. I know it's generic but you'll know where to get off as everyone gets off there and the stop is announced in English.About 20 minutes walk from the temple itself there is a big Lotte Premium brand outlet store that can be visited after the cultural trip to the temple.It is normally very windy at the temple so be prepared with a jacket even if warm in Busan."
Beautiful time to visit,Great visit! Thanks for the reviews to help me choose places on my short visit! The weather was perfect and the location - beautiful.
Must-visit ,"It's a great temple on the edge of the sea. We went from Heaundae station bus #100 to the temple station. It took us about 40-45 mins. Really WORTH IT!! Enjoyable and great way to learn some diversity in culture. If the day is windy, I recommend you take a hat, cap or a scarf to cover your ears, cuz it gets really windy there since it is on the edge. Definitely a must-visit in Busan. "
Beautiful temple by the sea,"If you are visiting busan, catch a bus out to this temple by the sea. It's about 30mins out but the view is worth the travel. "
Really fun way to spend a day,Great historic experience located right on the shore. All of the temples and surrounding area gives a pretty good glimpse of what was. Beautiful archtecture and walking paths. The market at the entrance was actually very unique and one of the more local markets we encountered. 
Great Place to experience cherry blossom,"I had been visit Korea for the only reason is Cherry Blossom, so one of my destination was Haedong Yonggung Temple. This temple is on the beach area, it makes this temple unique...Once you stepping your foot to this area...wow every line of the road full of cherry blossom blooming...like a petal, i suggest you to visit this place in early april (i was visit at 5th april)...Just take a bus no 181 from haeundae station then get exit no.7 to get this place, and of course pay by Tmoney card"
OMMMMMMMMMMMM...,Haedong Yonggung Temple was my introduction to Buddhism and Busan and is among the most beautiful places of worship that I have ever visited. Prepare to do a lot of walking considering the temple is built on a hillside overlooking the ocean but I can assure you that it is completely worth it. I also recommend you allow yourself enough time to really enjoy all that the temple has to offer. Namaste.
Amazing views of the temple by the sea!,"Took the bus going the temple, 15-20 minute uphill walk from the bus drop off point (wear comfortable shoes). But the view makes it worth it. This is one of my favorite temples as it is quite rare to see one near the ocean. A must visit when you are in Busan!"
My kids didn't like it,"There were many shops and eateries by the temple which was nice, but there weren't much to do especially for the little ones..."
Pray for safe ,"I took a train and a bus to go to here. the weather was so hot. But the view so nice. And you can drink sweet water in here, maybe you can get some lucky by that. "
A MUST to visit if you're in Busan!,"I've visited probably 3 temples when I went to South Korea last year, and this was my favourite!The temple is located on a cliff next to the sea, so the view is really breathtaking. I don't need to say anything else, it.was.just.breathtaking. The temple complex itself is quite big and has a nice layout with lots of statues. The temple also has beautiful intricate details. Combined with the view, it's just wow!*In addition, on the way up to the temple, there are a lot of street food stalls. I was literally eating all the way down. So, if you love street food as much as me, you will love this place!My suggestion is to take taxi from the nearest station. I took taxi coming here, and then bus on the way back. It was only 10 min by cab, but half hour by bus -_-"
Breathtaking View,The Temple is not easily accessible to everyone. To reach the Temple you must be able to descend a flight of stairs and walk about 10 minutes on flat ground. The view is beautiful as you walk along the ocean front to the Temple. As you arrive at the Temple you must cross a steep wooden bridge that leads to very uneven ground. Now that you have arrived at the Temple plaza there are steep stairs and another few minute walk to reach the lower level of the Temple.Once you reach the Temple it is very beautiful and the ocean view is breathtaking.
"Awesome, But Tiring!","This amazing temple sits in a GORGEOUS setting by the sea. But be aware, getting there is a tough walk involving 108 steps up and down stairs, so it is not for the faint of heart! The photo ops offered here are simply incredible. We had an awesome tour guide who really added a lot of context by telling us the historical and cultural significance of the attraction. A must do!"
A must spot in Busan,We took the BUTI bus and get there in approximately 30 minutes from Novotel.A nice walk along the beach from bus to temple.Be prepared to stay at least an hour so note the timetable of the bus to be sure you'll not wait too long for the bus - they are quite precise.It's free entrance and you'll have few great photos spots.Can be a bit crowded in the weekend (we went there on Saturday).If you have tome is worth going.Enjoy!
Temple by the sea,"The temple is well known to be one which is by the sea. Getting there is not a big problem, we took a bus from Haeundae station since we were staying in that area, however, i'm sure that you can also get a bus from somewhere else in Busan. getting to the temple means taking a short walk in as the bus drops you off along the road (after Lotte Mall). The temple isnt that of a huge size but interesting enough for perhaps a 1 hour stay in the temple area. getting to the actual temple will entail quite a number of stairs to navigate. But not to worry, on the way out, there's plenty of stalls and some cafes for you to quench your thirst. We were there in the summer, so its kinda hot."
Exotic temple,It is really unique to find a temple in the approximate to the sea. But its hill can be hard for the elderly.
Temple near the sea,"This place is unique, lots of korean people come here to pray and enjoy their time with the family.If you go there in april or may, the way to the temple full with cherry tree so you can see if they're blooming, the scenery become so romantic :)The temple located downhill, with many stairs made of stone, while we went there, we passed the food stall and souvenir stall and a park with a pagoda.We could see the ocean view from half the way to the temple.There's a bridge across the mainland with the small island where the temple's built.When we arrived at the temple we also could see a big statue."
Best temple in Korea,Out of all the temples I visited in Korea this one was the most interesting. I would recommend visiting if you are in Busan.
"A must see, and the view are amazing","The walk to the temple is great as well. Shops, food, and touristy things available. Bring CASH! The temple itself is a world of peace. The ocean views and the history is pretty neat. A must see"
Haedong Yunggungsa Temple,"We will surely go back to this place when we visit Busan again. It's a temple beside the sea and the view is breathtaking. You would want to take pictures of every corner, every side of this place. At the entrance, there are statues representing the different zodiac signs and you can have your picture taken with your zodiac sign. There are also food stalls near the entrance, so you can buy your snacks as you walk towards the temple. And there are souvenir shops also where you can buy different kinds of souvenirs which you can bring home - keychains, ref magnets, bracelets (assorted colors - for men and women), hats, even blouses, scarfs, etc. The place is simply amazing."
Breathtaking scenic view,"Must-visit in Busan! The temple by the water is so picturesque. If it weren't for the crowds, it would be such a nice place to have some quiet time, especially because you're by the sea. Might be best to go very early in the morning, before the tourists come."
"Great place, great views!","I came here with friend, who said that its rare temple, because its on sea site, not in mountain like every temple. Its special. Its true. This temple seems to be really special! It was build for Seawater Great Goddess Buddha in Goryeo dynasty! ( this is amazing!) Before entering temple pagodas you can see 4 lions. Later i get to know that they symbolizing joy, anger, sadness, and happiness. What is also interesting is stairs. There is exactly 108! View is amazing in between stairs and at the end of them. All make this temple so interesting and so special!. Definitely worth to see if you visit Busan!"
Recommend - Nice Temple,Temple situated by the sea. Very good view and windy even during summer time. Many stairs and plenty of walking if you want to visit the temple . The stairs are very steep and uneven. It was quite tough carrying stroller climbing the stairs. The temple is nice. There is a small cafe at the temple facing the sea where you can rest your feet and have a drink.
The loveliest walk ever!,"With the cool wind blowing, amidst a lovely view of the open sea, a visit to this temple is a must! Surrounded by such peace and serenity, one feels calm, meditative and appreciative of God's creation. It feels like just the place ""to touch God""! The long walk to the temple is just lovely, so take your time and savour the experience, filling your lungs with the fresh cool air!"
Beautiful temple,Usually temples are on the mountain..but this temple is near the beach.You should go downstairs to see this beautiful temple..But when you arrive there..it is amazing..very beautiful. 
Beautiful temple,"It is a simple temple near the beach, the view from there is good. There are many statues and small traditional shops. Peaceful environment."
Beautiful Location,"After getting off the metro there are tourism experts to help point you in the right direction to take the proper bus. Upon arrival there are plenty of signs to guide you on your 10 minute walk to the entrance.This Buddhist temple is set in a stunning location right along the beach with a bridge spanning part of the sea. As far as the temple goes it's fairly ordinarily. If your used to seeing Buddhist temples then you won't find anything ""spectacular"" except the view. "
Definitely a must-visit in Busan,"This Temple is known for its beauty and the stunning view surrounding it (for the Buddha of granting a son if you're looking for that lol). Its history and meaning is pretty interesting as well though I visited this place rather late so time was tight, couldn't stick around to finish reading.Now, unless you have a car, the route to the Temple is somewhat discouraging I would say. Took me over an hour to finally get to the gate of the Temple (maybe 30' on tube, another 20' on bus, plus 10-15' walking). However, it is totally worth all the trouble. So if you're visiting Busan, make this your top pick! I recommend coming here first thing in the morning, then taking the bus back to Heundae where you can visit Sealife, walk along the beach. And if I remember correctly, the trail to the park(?) near the APEC house is 1 stop after Heaundae. That trail offers amazing views of the ocean, the buildings and the Diamond bridge."
Great view,The temple was pretty easy to get to by bus. Have to walk about 10 mins from the bus station up hill. The temple is free to visit and there are lots of different statue to pray and see. The temple is also by the sea side which has an amazing view. Totally worth visiting if you are in Busan.
Amazing touristic temple by the sea,"Haedong Yonggungsa is a temple specifically for tourists and prayers. Though it's hard to experience typical Buddhist temple of Korea here, tourists will have fun to watch with a great seaside view.- From Nampo, bus #100 transferring after bus #1003 at 'Shindosi Sijang' is available. The entrance is about 10 min walk from the bus stop. But, it's a long way until the real temple because there are many steps downward, souvenir shops, food street, etc.This is almost the northeastern end of touristic areas of Busan, I recommend to have a day trip starting from this temple. There are Songjeong Beach, Haundae Beach and Dongbaekseom Island along the coast to the south.- After passing the bamboo trail, there's a food street and it's good to try something to eat.- Very crowded. Lots of tourists, just a few prayers and very few monks.- Since this temple is facing the sea, it has a great view. Visiting at sunrise is nice as well.- It is said there's a special ceremony on Buddha's Day (April 8 of Lunar Calendar)."
Temple by the sea,"Had a wonderful visit to this temple. The location is stunning with view of Busan in the distance. The Temple is accessed through a long walk way. There are statues of the Chinese Horoscope on the this. The temple itself has different sections. There is a large gold Buddha which people kneel to pray at. There are many photo opportunities here, there is also a small coffee shop with a glass wall which allows for viewing whilst eating."
Lovely temple next to the sea,"The unusual location of this temple makes it a must visit if in Busan. There is a steep climb down and up again, so be warned. Definitely worth the effort though. Was very busy on the day we went, but that did not take away from the experience."
An enchanting experience,"A truly stunning temple. When walking to it you do feel as if you have stepped back in time. The sculptures were amazing and awe-inspiring. The best moment for me was standing at the top next to the goddess of mercy, seeing and hearing the waves crash on to the rocks as well as listening to the chants by a monk on the sound system. Getting there is easy - from Haeundae station take the 181 bus (going East) and get off at Yonggung Temple stop. The electronic display is in English too. When you get off turn right, go straight for about 50 yards and then left in to the winding road that will take you to the temple - from the bus stop it's a 10 minute walk."
Temple by the ocean side,First temple visited to be overseeing the ocean. Unique and definitely recommended for a visit. The temple is however small and spent only an hour at the temple.
So glad we did this afterall,It seemed such a long way. Too far to walk from our hotel in Heundae Beach so we decided to chance the 100 bus. Well a great little journey we just counted the stops and actually alighted at the right one. It was 740metres to the Temple with the first few hundred yards or so a bit up hill but then it got easier. There were all ages there even though there were quite a few steps to negotiate just take your time. NOT a place for the really disabled though. Fantastic carvings and amazing architecture considering it all had to be brought into a Cliffside setting. Amazing what men can do when the set their mind to it. I would say a must do when in Busan
still one of my favourite temples in Korea,amazing temple with amazing views but it's getting quite crowded. must visit if you are there at busan for the first time but do note that it's located slightly far from city centre. combine it with a trip to haeundae
Interesting Buddhist temple near the sea,"Be prepared to walk for around 10mins up-slope after alighting at the bus stop however, the view upon arriving at the temple is breathtaking. It was a bit crowded when we reached there as it was around noon time where there were quite a number of tour groups. Even if you may not be a Buddhist, but the view, scenery and culture is worth visiting."
Buddhist Temple at seaside,The view from the temple is nice cause the location is situated at seaside but it took a quite a long way to arrive. You have to go haeundae station take bus 181 or 9 to yonggung stop. Around 30min then walk to the temple withing 10min walking distance. 
Beautiful temple ,"Awesome experience! However we visited on Children's Day so of course it was very crowded. But the temple was decorated with lanterns for Buddha's birthday, so beautiful! Cute shops and food stalls that you pass on your way to the temple as well"
Temple Visit,"worth visiting. Picturesque and beautiful place. However, it is some distance away from the bus stop and Lotte Outlet."
Breathtakingly beautiful,"The temple is indeed breathtaking, both in its view as well as being a good workout as there are quite a bit of stairs to traverse to reach it but it was worth it. There is a little tuck shop at the top of the temple where you can buy water or snack foods from with a little room with seats where you can rest and recharge before taking on more stairs. Be sure to try out the Lucky Coin Divination coin-toss on the bridge just before the temple."
Lovely and unique setting,"During a short trip from Seoul to Busan, we decided to visit this Buddhist temple that's uniquely situated on the seashore a few miles north of Busan. We enjoyed a perfect spring day - not too crowded - among both tourists enjoying the sights and practitioners stopping to pray, light candles or make small donations. Overall a very peaceful retreat from the big city. A nice bonus was all the cherry blossoms along the short access road leading from the highway to the temple."
Beautiful,It is located by the sea on the rock. It is really picturesque. Crowded but you can still take pictures. It has wonderful atmosphere.
a very nice place. . . great views too.,A gentle few steps down and around the temples. . all in all a very nice way to spend 45 mins of a whistlestop weekend visit to Busan .. 
Very beautiful ,Nice view from temple. Always be there early to avoid tour crowds. Temple was decorated with colorful lanterns making it such a nice spots for photo taking. 
Beautiful Temple,I visited the temple in late April just before the Buddhist festival so the temple was fully decorated with the colourful lanterns yet the festive crowd were not there yet (only the tourists). It is a nice change to seeing a temple along the coastal line instead of in the mountain or forest. It reminds me of Tanah Lot - the Balinese temple in Bali Indonesia.Although there is not a lot of climbing - this attraction is not for family with children still using the stroller/pram or those on wheelchair as there are many many steps. I don't see any lift facilities.
Great photo ops,Went during a holiday and Buddha's birthday so it was a little more crowded than usual. It was still a great place to visit and take photos. Not too much climbing. Had market vendors with good food options. Parking seemed fine. Hit the bathrooms before the tour buses. 
"Awesome and unique, but try to aoid the crowds","This is one of the best-known temples in Busan. We had been here back in 2004 or so, and we returned this time around for Buddha's Birthday celebrations (May 3 in 2017). That was kind of a mistake. Traffic to and from the temple was horrendous, and once we were there, there was actually a line forming - a slow-moving line - leading to the temple. Once there, it seemed everyone was getting in one another's way. That didn't detract much from the overall awesomeness of the unique coastal views (Most Korean Buddhist temples are in the mountains.), and the crowd was an upbeat holiday one. However, we and all the other folks there kind of removed the magic due to the noise and shuffle created. I could tell some of the people who were there to actually do some serious worshipping were annoyed, but crowds are to be expected at any major religious site on holidays. We'll definitely return again when there are fewer people - perhaps during a weekday that's not a national holiday.The temple is much easier to get to than it used to be. The last time we were there, bus service was spotty. Now, there are a couple of big buses (#'s 100 and 181) that pick you up from various locations around Haeundae and/or Song-Jeong Beach and take you to the entrance to the temple's front road. I think ""village bus"" (""maeul buseu"" in Korean) #9 also goes there from the Song-Jeong bus stop."
Nice temple along the sea,"Nice temple located along the sea.Might be crowded at times.In order to get to the temple, we have to walk about 10minutes from the back of National Fisheries Research & Development Institute.There is a signage that show you the straight walk along the sea coast to the temple.You can also try to stack the stones at a spot before the temple.If you're not sure of the way, do approach anyone that you see there and they will be able to guide you."
Very Good Location Temple,Seldom have temple built facing the sea and this is really nice location temple to let Buddhist and tourist visit and pray in the temple with a nice view. Honestly the temple building is nice built but not the best one that I visited before but location still is the advantages of this place for visit.
Interesting and nice seaside setting but commercialized,You pass through a corridor of souvenir and food shops before entering the temple proper. The grounds are pretty and the sea view is nice. But the temple complex is really nothing great.
Unique temple,It is a unique temple in Korea. It is not traditional style. Here is far from city 30min. by taxi. But enjoy a lot of food on the road with ocean view
Great time in the Spring,"Took my family here (wife, 2 kids, and mother in law) my 3 year old was able to appreciate the site and sight. Beautiful location and easy to get to with the BUSAN Tour Bus (BUTI)"
Beautiful temple and grounds,Beautiful temple and grounds perched on the cliffs next to the sea. Fabulous setting and worth a visit.
Nice place!,"This tempel has a scenic setting and several nice little features, like interesting groups of sculptures, erc. The sea adds to the scenery of course. Also the bus journey from Hundae beach and little walk from bus stop to temple adds to impressions you get from that visit. The places and temples in Korea tend to be very similar to each other and this one is little different due to setting so definitely worth of visit if you are in Busan. There are frequent busses right from the metro and they have tempels name written on them in English so it is really easy. The walk from bus stop to temple is about 0.7 km, but it is a very nice little walk. "
Great temple with beautiful see view,It's a really cool temple next to the sea. The view is really nice. We came on a Sunday (from Haundae area with bus 100) so there were a lot of people visiting the temple. I would recommend not to go on the weekend to avoid the amount of people. 
Go on a sunny day!,"I really liked the temple. I went on a sunny day and the way up to the temple from the bus stop was really pretty as it was cherry blossom season. It takes between 10-15 mins from the bus stop to the temple. Try to go early in the morning though as the bus ride can take forever during rush hour (I went at 16:00) - I took bus 100 from Haeundae, but I think 180 also goes there. Temple is located on the ocean, I spent maybe 30 mins there. I think it was worth it as it was peaceful and a nice view. I did prefer it to Beomeosa Temple."
Temple with great ocean view,"This is not a huge temple, however worth visiting. The scenery is peaceful. Moreover, you can also visit an aquarium near the temple for free."
Seaside temple with interesting exhibits,The temple was at the coast line with some interesting views and exhibits to entice everyone. Souvenirs stalls along the path to the temple and a couple of restaurants for hungry visitors. 
Nice view,"I went we a muslim and christian friends so we went for the view only, but lots of people go to the temple. Even if you are not religious is worth to go and enjoy the view, statues and architeture. You will have to take the bus and walk so be ready."
A visit to Busian is not complete without Haedong Yonggung Temple,"This is a good place to learn about this ancient Buddhist temple in Gijang-gun, Busan. By visiting Haedong Temple you will be able to experience two key advantages, one is learning about the Buddhist culture in Korea and secondly you will be able to enjoy the breathtaking seaside and mountain view of the location.Bare in mind that the temple is located in high altitude locations so expect a lot of walking and keep hydrated by drink a lot of water specially during the hot summer. This place is not recommended for people with walking challenges or children. There are a lot of narrow steps which takes one person at a time.The language barrier was an issue therefore I really recommend to join an English speaking tour guide to visit the temple since it is not that easy to get there and also the tour guide will be able to explain and answer your questions about the location.Overall, this is a great historical and touristic place to visit, if you are in Busan prepare for it and you will never regrade it."
Not worth it,This place is a long way out of the way- takes at least a long bus ride to get here but probably a train as well and...it's not worth it. Slightly run down temple in a beach setting. I wouldn't rush back. 
Love it,My favorite place to go anytime I get to Busan. Very busy with tourists but such a lovely visit. Highly reccommend a vist.
Nice place to stroll,Nice place to stroll. Have been to many temples throughout Asia and this was a little different due to the beautiful setting. You have to walk through vendors to get to the temple but they weren't as aggressive as some at other temples that I have visited
Old Temple on a cliff,"We took the KRW15,000 Busan City Tour (BUTI) Bus that combine Red and Blue Lines to visit Haedong Yonggung Temple. The Blue Bus stops at the Fisheries Research Centre and it is about 15 minutes walk to the Temple. From where the bus stops,head straight to the seaside and walk down the steps, turn right onto the boardwalk. Here you see signboard that points to the direction of the Temple.The boardwalk part is easy, but nearer the temple, there are some up-hill uneven steps. Not too difficult. All 4 of us are between 60 to 70 years old and find the climb easy.View at the temple ground is definitely worth the climb up-hill. Just looking out into the sea is relaxing for us. We could hear chanting when we were at the ground."
Just a temple facing the sea,Go to visit as the only temple recommended by traveller. Not easily access from Busan city if not taking BUTI tour. 
"A temple next to the sea with superb view, but they're packed with people","The temple is one of the must-see spots in Busan. But it might be a little difficult if you're on your own. I was lucky that my colleague spent some time to drive me there. We arrived around 11 am, and there were many tourists already. Walking around the temple can be difficult, sometimes people wanted to take photo or you wanted to take photo. There seems to be many levels that you can climb up and down to find the good spot for scenic views. "
Splendid side trip,"Had to take the BUTI bus from Busan Train Station to see this Temple by the Sea. The pathway along the shore is ok but at the temple site itself it became so constricted (perhaps there were so many people, being a Sunday). Nice place to meditate (the Buddha presides over the site)."
A Temple of Peace on a Cliff,"I really loved this temple and its location. You have to walk a bit if you take the bus, but even walking was fun because of the cherry blossoms around the road. My only complaint was the bars and the rope they put around. It was a perfect place to take a magnificent picture because of the location but it wasn't even possible. If you are disabled, unfortunately, it is not a place for you. Also, it is free."
Scenic Seaside Temple,"I went on a rainy day, and it was worth it. Even with the rain, it is quite scenic out there. Pluses:- free entrance- food stalls before you head in (or for after you're done)- not too crowded at 4 pm (but maybe part of that was the rain?)- scenic!- lots of cherry blossoms (in spring)Tips:- You can take a bus up from the subway station or take a taxi. I took a taxi up from Haeundae Station and it was 8,100 won.- walk from drop off area is not long...but there are a lot of stairs (which were a little slippery in the rain)--but totally doable- there is a restroom/toilet up by the temple"
Nice Temple,Nice waterfront temple with great views and lots of interesting vendor stalls. Peaceful environment (unless it is packed with tourists)
Unique Temple off a cliff,"Best and most unique Temple I have ever been to in Korea, as it is nearby the sea The compound is very big. So you can explore everywhere around here. The atmosphere here is so nice and refreshing and you can see beautiful views of the sea from this temple."
Busan must see!,"A unique temple perched on a cliff over the sea. Although crowded with tourists, a very nice walk around the grounds. Be aware there are many steps, and uneven ground. "
Great,"A thirty minute bus ride from Haeundae Beach, then a short walk.....it's a very beautiful spot, well worth the visit."
Nice Views,Its really cool when you visit a temple! It is by the ocean so there was a lot of breeze and super cold when you go at the wrong time. Its awesome to talk pictures of! There are stairs so I believe it is not wheel chair accessible because I did not see any ramps. Its a nice view and pretty cool 
Good energy for New year,"i went there on new year. it was a little bit crowded but i really happy to went there it's so beautiful and nice view. in front of temple is sea and in the back is mountain that is good for Feng Shui (Fortune) i felt like i was given good energy, but for elderly people or disabled might be difficult to get inside the temple becuase you have to climb up and down stairs even me i'm 24 i was so tired"
Temple near to the sea,"second time visiting the temple, nothing much changes after 4 years but the view is super good, during winter, the sky will dark very soon. just need to take note that a long slope up to the temple and lots of steps at the temple.. recommend to wear comfortable shoe or sport shoe when go there."
Well kept Temples,"Nice to visit early morning as place can be crowded by tourist as it gets late.Direction: Take Metro Line 2 and get off at Haeundae station then take Exit 7. Take bus No. 181 and get off at Yonggungsa Temple Bus Stop. The ride takes around 30minutes. During the trip when you hear the Yonggungsa Temple Bus stop, press the STOP button on the Bus for you to let the bus driver that you will be getting off on that stop. Because some of the drivers do not stop on one station if they see that there were no passengers waiting.When you get off at Yonggungsa Temple Bus stop, there are signs going to the temple. If you prefer to walk, it is atleast a 800meter walk going up. It is best that you buy a T-Money/Cash Bee at any convenience store like 7evelen or mini stop for you to use on subway & bus. T-Money card cost is 4,000 won and you need to load it."
A well maintained buddhist temple by the sea,We decided to take a break on our hop on and hop off city tour and visit this temple by the sea. It takes about 10-15 minutes walk along a foot path crossing a foot bridge and a few steps along the way. Once you reach the main temple you can still walk up the hill negotiating even more steps to see a giant Buddha statue. Definitely worth seeing if you are up to climbing a few steps.
方便造訪的郊區景點，能尋得美景與內心平靜easy to go and find beautiful sight and inner peace ,"海雲台搭乘市區巴士就能快速又輕鬆到達，緩坡向上進入大門，沿途春天可以看到整路櫻花，可惜我們去的時間稍早，只有滿樹花苞，寺內雖要爬些階梯，但還算輕鬆寫意！當在第一個藥師如來旁的平台看到礁岩上的寺廟，一切都值得了！若是信仰佛教者，可以靜下心來，能一股溫暖的撫慰感，不然光看美景與其他人參拜的情形也很值得！不趕時間的話每個角落都要走一走！下山後可以步行到一站之隔的樂天免稅及超市休息或購物，外面就是公車站，方便滿載而歸。It's easy to go there by city bus from Haeundae, and would not take too much energy to get into the temple or browse around the the temple, even though I broke my knee few days ago. There are many Sakura and camellias along the roads, come at the right season then the sceneries will surprise you. Every effort you make is worthy once you see the temple on the cliff beside the ocean. The atmosphere will comfort you and help you find inner peace. Also the Lotte outlet & mall & super is a bus stop away from this temple. After the visit in the temple, tourists can walk there for foods or shopping. There's a bus stop right outside the outlet, take your time and enjoy a one-day tour on your own!"
Best Place in Busan to See New Year's Sunrise,"This famous temple is quite hard to reach if you can't read Korean language.The easiest to go here is by bus to the nearest stop, and continue by taxi.The temple faces East, making it perfect to watch sunrise, especially in new year's day.The sea breeze and the sound of the waves breaking into the stones complement the atmosphere of the temple."
nice place to visit,This place is worth to visit and easy to find and you can a ride bus from city going to the temple. But need to walk approx. 15-20 mins from the bus.And lot of food stall and souvenir shops.
worth a visit,we visited the site as part of a cruise trip interesting temple very busy plenty to see try the local food at the small market
Beautiful scenery,This is a gorgeous temple and very accessible by car or bus. No subway runs up this way though from what I can tell. The grounds are well kept and people are foreigner friendly. Bring a selfie stick or a tripod if you want good photos!!
Serene temple,It's a nice quick place to visit. Not many steps to climb. Many street food as well as small gift articles or souvenir shops to choose from. 
valuable to visit,"You are suggested to plan 1) having snow crab for lunch in (2 hours) and visit Haedong Yonggung Temple 3) by taxi (not more than 10,000 won) or on foot (30 mins) Lotte Premium Outlets - Dongbusan Branch (롯데 프리미엄아울렛 동부산점) where the three venues are located on the same route. Haedong Yonggungsa Temple is situated on the coast of the north-eastern portion of Busan. The temple is along the shore line where you can take beautiful photos during sunset. Other special sites at the temple are the 108 stairs and stone lanterns lining the rocky landscape. After going down the 108 steps, you will be delighted with the beauty of the temple. You can breath with fresh air, listening calming sounds of the waves, scene of seagulls flying free and view the majestic sunrise. After that, you can buy some souvenir and try some snack from shops along the entrance of the temple.It is easy to take taxi to Lotte Premium Outlets or on foot."
Fascinating,This is an interesting experience with amazing views. Bring a good pair of walking shoes. There is a lot of walking to see the beautiful temple grounds..
Beautiful temple,"This temple is have a beautiful view Beautiful beach, nice weather for make merit if you come to Busan you must come to this temple ~ RECOMMENDED "
Temple by the sea,Haedong Yonggung Temple is one of my favorite places to see in Busan. The temple itself is beautiful. The fact that it is located by the clear blue ocean is a plus. The statues which made of rock are fascinating. This temple where local people go so you will be able to see many religion ceremonies performed there.
Beautiful Temple on the Ocean,"We took the #100 bus from Haeundae and walked to the temple. The temple is on the ocean and has a number of Buddha's, the Korean zodiac statues, many different statues hidden in the brush and many buildings. There are lots of stairs, so beware if you don't walk well. The gift shop has many different beads, bells and books. Outside of the temple are small stands which sell the typical Korean knickknacks and snacks. We bought some candy and it was really good. This was a great way to spend the morning. It you want to make a day of it, the Lotte Outlet Mall is across the street from the temple."
Hands down the best temple in Busan,"Took a bus from Haeundae station and ended up at the main road. It took us another 15-20mins before reaching the temple entrance. If you don't feel like walking in, you can take a cab in and it should cost you less than KRW10000.The entrance of the temple is cluttered with many stalls selling all sorts of things from dried chrysanthemum flowers(for tea) to souvenirs to tteokbuki.Walk further inside and you'll be greeted with another world of serenity and calm. I've read many reviews from others that said this place was cluttered with tour groups and such, but it sure didn't happen to me. It felt as though I had the whole temple to myself. Maybe its because we were there early!You'll first see a whole row of the 12 Chinese Zodiac Animals and a huge Goddess of Mercy, before arriving at a small gate that leads you to a flight of steps downwards. As you walk down the steps, be sure to not miss a small lane to the left as it will bring you to another cliff where you can take very nice pictures of the whole temple from another angle. There's also a golden Buddha with the sea as a backdrop.Next, you can return to the main flight of steps and carry on walking to the main temple. There's a bridge where you can try to throw coins into the bowls below for good luck. Further up ahead, to the left, will be a stall offering you to write words of blessings on what seems like copper roof tiles for a price of KRW30000. It is just in front of 2 golden pig statues.To the right is a small fountain. Apparently, you're supposed to cleanse yourself with the water before entering the main temple grounds. Walk further up and there's a passageway that leads to another underground spring/fountain.Next, be prepared to climb a flight of uneven and rocky steps. You'll be rewarded with a huge statue of the Goddess of Mercy. It can get really slippery if the steps are wet.The main temple hall really isn't that huge, but occasionally there'll be a monk in there chanting sutras.In all, for the picturesque view of the temple by the sea, this is a must-go place in Busan, and definitely worth a second visit!"
Temple with Beautiful seaview.,"Visited this beautiful sea view temple that is a distance from the city. Very picturesque and you will be taking lots of photos here for sure. Take subway line 2 and get off @ Haeundae Station. Exit 7 and take a taxi to the temple. Once you see the big Lottery Factory Outlets you are almost there. Fare around KRW8,000.Have fun! "
"Amazing view, amazing temple","Best temple in Busan. Excellent view, different. I managed to throw a coin into the wishing well from the temple at the top. I forgot if I made a wish..."
Nice temple attach the sea,This temple is quite far from the city but you don't miss this place.You can enjoy scenic view with the temple.Transpotation is very convinience by the bus and walk to the temple.
Beautiful place ,Since it was Lunar New Year there was plenty of people. But it was worth seeing :-) Just next to the Temple are nice rocks where you can sit and enjoy the sea :-) 
Small yet so beautiful. ,Really nice temple with beautiful intricate designs. Nice view and intimate temple for a short view. 
Very nice place. Would love to go back again.,"This temple is a bit hard to get to. It took us quite alot of research and asking to figure out the right bus to take. And with the help of a friendly passenger, we were able to get off at the right stop. Wish the sign could be clearer for non-Koreans."
Wonderful! Must-see in Busan.,"This temple is special because of its spectacular location on the rocks overlooking the sea. This unique setting is not to be missed. You need transportation to get here from the central part of the city, but it's worth finding a way. A must-see when visiting Busan!"
"Rare temple by the sea, pretty but busy","Nice views and scenery, so worth the visit. It's a working temple, so don't go expecting a 1000 year old site and structures. We went on a weekend, so it was very busy. Easy to get to from Haeundae Station by bus."
so awkwardatmosphere,"I been here two times before, but every-time when i visit here, i saw so many awkward things in there. most terrible temple i ever seen. but the first time sea view and temple's were so beautiful. "
The Goddess watching over by the sea,"On a high ground right by the sea with the big statue of Kwan Yin or the Goddess of Mercy facing toward the sea (in Vietnam, they call her 'Lady Buddha' to be seen all over the country and most prominently in Da Nang right above the bay where she watches over the fishermen for their well-being, so I'm not sure if it's like the same idea here although you won't see any fishing skiffs in a developed country like Korea!), this temple is one of the two ""must"" places of the city (with the other one being Gamcheon Culture Village); also to be seen on the ""sprawling"" temple grounds are big sculptures (all golden except for one), specifically those of: a big dragon near the main temple building (as if ""guarding"" the building where there are three golden Buddhas that are only pretty-medium-sized but the wall paintings both inside & outside the building are pretty ""outstanding""), the laughing monk & a turtle right beside the main building, a pair of pigs also near the main building and a monk (or maybe a statue of Buddha himself) on the edge of the cliff about a 5-minute walk from the main temple grounds. I was also ""somewhat intrigued"" by these cone-shaped stone structures (kind of like 'chedi' structures in southeast Asia) seen a little to the distance from the temple grounds, but there's no access to those cone structures from the temple grounds.Located on the eastern outskirt of the city with no metro subway station nearby, I took the No. 181 bus for about half an hour from just outside Haeundae Station (on the subway Line 2) near the Haeundae Beach; and from the bus stop after getting off, it's about a 10-minute walk to the temple entrance where the row of statues of ""zodiac animals"" & the multi-level mini-pagoda are the first things to see upon arrival after passing through the cluster of souvenir shops (there's also a little building for food near that cluster of shops right before the temple entrance)."
Beautiful scenery,Exquisite Temple and The must to visit when you stay in busan . nice place to make merits can to go here talk by bus
A must see when in Busan,Very serene quite place with plenty of local taste. Nice view of the temple on the beach. Highly recommended 
Interesting but a bit too commercial,"Went here with my in-laws. The location is beautiful - on the cliffs overlooking the ocean. Lots of uneven steps up and down to get there. Good statues, bridges, and buildings. However, it is spoiled with all of the commercial signs and stalls. Still worth the side trip. "
Beautiful landscape,Very romantic and magic religious spot on a seaside.Many locals and tourists especially on weekend and holidays.Considered to be a sacred buddish place in entire Korea
Some great views but fairly small,"The statues and the views out to the sea are well worth visiting the temple for. However, anyone expecting a cultural experience will be a little disappointed as it is quite tourist heavy. It's possible to see everything in less than half an hour, but there is a nice coastal walk leading from the temple."
Perfect place to watch sunrise ,Beautiful and serene Buddhist temple by the seafront. Perfect spot to watch the sun rise if you following the track to the left on your way in. One of the few Korean Buddhist temples I have visited which accepted donations by credit cards- which is a good thing as I couldn't find an ATM which is compatible with foreign cards at Busan!Don't leave Busan without visiting this place - it's about 15mins taxi ride fromHaeundae beach.
Crowded,It was crowded with people...maybe due to weekend.There are food stalls at the entrance .Must try the food as the food is very delicious and worth-trying.
Spiritual and peaceful,"make sure you are wearing comfortable walking shoes, the paths are a little uneven in places and a reasonable amount of walking up and down uneven stairs is required. Great views and make sure you have some coins handy to throw into wishing well."
Beautiful scenerey around temple area.,"I took the bus near Haeundae station. It goes directly to Haedong Yonggung Temple for $1. I missed it on the way back, but took city bus for about $2. It was a beautiful sunny day of 18 Celsius when I visited the temple by the sea. The ocean scenery is very beautiful. Temple area is decently busy, but not very crowded. There are food stalls along the walk, but a little town just before hiking up to the location."
Waste of time. Commercialised and lousy view,"Lots of tourists, took 15 minutes just to slowly walk into the temple as there were quite a few steps and too many people. Thank goodness the crowd was pretty much orderly so as there was no shoving. Could have been dangerous because the steps are steep. Temple itself offered nothing, and views of the sea was disappointing. Please don't waste your time here"
Beautiful Site for a Temple,Beautiful temple built on the clifts with dramatic waves crashing against the rocks. There are some snack shops and souvenir shops leading to the steps down and up to the temple. Try to go early before the tourists descend upon the temple nearer mid morning/lunch time.
Not what I was hoping,"Having lived in Busan for 15 years I have heard many people talk about this temple. Most people had great things to say about how picturesque it was. Now, having finally visited it I can give my own opinion.My family visited on a Friday morning. Upon approaching the temple the first structure you encounter is a shabby snack shack opposite a Buddha statue. Many people stop here and take pictures. Then you climb a narrow wooded path toward the main temple. You have to squeeze in line if it is a busy day. Once you enter the actual temple grounds you seen many things that feel like they are arranged for tourists to take pictures and make soon forgetful memories. Because of the crowds, people posing and the multiple opportunities to spend money; the natural beauty of the place gets lost.How could serious Buddhists come to this temple to worship? Sorry, but the time involved to get here and the jockeying in position to take that all important photo to prove that I have been here do not make this destination all that attractive to me. And our young sons could have cared less if they went."
"Busy, but well worth a visit.","Scenery is amazing in that there is the juxtaposition of rocky headland with a temple perched on the side and then off to one side the skyscrapers and beach. It's quite steep climbing back up after a walk down. There is plenty to see - a large golden Buddha, a Buddha of mercy, a candle grotto and then the observation platform which gives great views back to the temple with sea-waves breaking across the rocks. As you go in (or out) there are some good street-food pitches providing inexpensive snacks."
Nice temple on a cliff by the sea ,One more Buddha temple in a beautiful setting in a small cliff by the sea and it is beautiful Must visit in busan try throwing the coin from a bridge in the divine pond down and check your luckThe temple is very serene with beautiful Buddha statue 
exceptional,above exceptional view of the temple and the sea and also a great place for worship and also for pictorials
Worth going,Beautiful place to visit. You can get there by subway (heundae stn) . There is a green bus (no 9) that takes you to the entrace of the temple. 
Worth the trip!,"We took the cab from Haeundae station and it cost us around 8,100 won. Saved us lots of time as the temple is not near any stations and is accessible by public bus. It is essentially a temple by the sea. A good place for a little tranquility and a scene away from the bustle and hustle of a city. The entire tour around the temple will take you 30 mins if you are quick and an hour if you are slow. Would suggest an early morning or late afternoon visit where there's less ppl and the sun isn't shining too brightly."
Nice view,We went to the temple as it was part of our tour. It was a good way to expose our young child to another culture. There were also a lot of food stalls near the temple so you can sample some street food on your way out.
Go there if you haven't seen a temple before,"Nice area and temple, but the serenity is a bit ""polluted"" by all the vending machines and modern adds compared to for instance Japanese temples. If you haven't been to a temple before, it will be a nice place to visit though, and the surrounding areas are nice for a hike along the water front."
Amazing view ,Long walking distance from the main road junction to the temple (20min) . Overalls not bad .. strong winds. 
Beautiful at sunset. ,"Free admission. 3000 won parking. Cabs were lined up if you need one. NOT handicap accessible. Beautiful. We got there at 4:30 and there was no crowd. Very scenic. Being 500 years old, the temple and hand carved stairways were a sight to see. It's very peaceful when there is no crowd. "
One of the best scenery temple ,"If you are travelling to Busan, this is definitely one of the best spot to visit. The temple is situated along the coast line."
"O.K., interesting that it is by the sea","Certainly not the most interesting or awe inspiring temple in SE Asia, but if you are in the area and want something to do it is fine to visit. It is free so that is a big plus. Does have lots of stairs so be aware of that aspect if stairs are a factor. If you have seen other large Buddhist Temples (for example in Thailand), then this on will probably not be so impressive. It is interesting that this one is by the sea. "
Awesome view,"This is one of the destination that I wanted to see in Busan. We went there on the first day (as the next day was forecasted to rain). We took a bus from Haeundae subway station. it took about 20 mins. The bus stopped close to the temple sign. What we didn't prepare for was to walk from the street to the temple entrance about 1 km). From there, we have to walk up & down the stairs to get to the temple. it was a windy day and the sea was rough. The temple was as picturesque as I imagined. Though it was not very big. Leaving the temple, we didn't feel like walking up and downthe stairs again (which was quite steep). We took a, shall I say, side exit which leaded to a fishery museum. Through there, we could walk right to the street where the bus stop was."
"Overrated, in my opinion, but it's free","There was not much special about this temple. In fact, the average Korean temple is probably better because it wouldn't have the hundreds of people milling about trying to get selfies. It felt very commercial. The best part of that trip was going down to the rocks and then eating some odeng. But if you have time to kill and nothing else to do , why not give it a visit? "
The best temple by the sea!,"We went there to see this famous temple and check it out ourselves, it was a beauty worth spending your time for, the sea and the teplme compliments each other in a very harmonious way. To get there you need to take a bus from haeundae station or take 10 minutes taxi ride (this is a lot easier)."
"Beautiful view of the sea, but a little underwhelming compared to Japan","I saw this temple as part of a cruise that visited Japan and South Korea. The view and location of this temple next to the sea were the real winning points, but the temple itself was not really anything special compared to some of the intricate temples I saw in Japan. Nonetheless worth the visit if you are in the area."
Beautiful but some touristy/city aspects ,"The temples is beautiful and its uniqueness (being a Buddhist temple by the ocean rather than the mountains) alone should draw you there. The marble looks new and clean, and it is easily walkable. However, the view is marred by construction of buildings in the distance and modern elements have seeped into many of the traditional sites. Still beautiful and worthwhile, but did not live up to the Google images or description others gave"
This Place is A Must,"Haedong Yonggung Temple is a place you must visit when you are in Busan. The place is very beautiful and it's surrounded by sea and makes it's the best thing you'll ever see.You won't regret it if you visit this place. Your eyes will thank you for visiting Yonggungsa Temple. You can go there by a bus, and walking for about 3km. It's a little bit tiring especially to someone who never do any sports :D LOL :D"
Breath taking!,"We took the railway and bus to reach this temple. The bus will stop at a bus stop 5 minutes walk to the entrance. Although it took some time to go from centre of the town, as soon as we reach the entrance of the temple, I know that this all long travel worth it! The temple was built on the sea, it was very stunning. The building has a long staircase to another side of the temple, its called a longevity stairway. We visited on the Koreans public holiday, although it was a bit crowded, but overall it was a nice visit ;)"
Beautiful temple on the sea,"We went there on a Tuesday, but there were so many visitors! Beautiful temple. Many stairs going down to reach the temple, but it's well built so it is not too difficult to get back up to the exit.The souvenirs were expensive, and the snacks sold outside the temple expensive and not tasty. "
Touristy temple,This is a very nice temple by the sea with great views and photo ops but very crowded. They have small eating and souvenir places leading up to the entrance of the temple
Very Beautiful,Great place to visit a stunning temple by the sea. Very lovely and worth the trip out. Great way to spend half a day.
Temple accessible without mountain-climbing,"An temple area with stunning views to the sea. As most temples are on the mountains, this one is located by the seaside. Many sculptures and beautiful buildings to see, but crowds (maybe because it was Saturday afternoon) make the experience somewhat troublesome. There are sometimes narrow paths or gangways and you need to queue simply to move to a different part of the temple.To get there we took a cab (about 15-20 mins and 12 000 won from Haeundae), and as it was getting dark when we headed back, it was impossible to get a cab. So we walked to the main street down the hill (15-20 mins) and took a but back to Haeundae (about half an hour).For eating and drinking there is street food stalls and some cafes, but we didn't notice any place with a view to the sea (there might have been though)."
"Beautiful, unique","Beautiful temple, stunning coastline views, but MANY steps, which were often steep and of irregular height. Definitely not handicapped accessible."
Breathtaking view,"Not easy to reach this place especially for old people but worth it. Beautiful scenery. Breathtaking. Go to this place, you won't regret it."
Don't goduring weekends,Made the mistake of visiting on a Sunday morning and it was extremely crowded. There were simply too many people with no opportunity to tour the temple properly and wander around leisurely as there was too much jostling and shoving. Didn't enjoy a single moment of it and spent only 20 mins there.
Beautiful temple on a cliff ,This is a must-go if you're in Busan. The temple is situated by the sea on a cliff so the scenery is really breath-taking. It can get cold when the wind blows so you might wanna have a jacket with you. 30mins is sufficient to cover the place. Most people would proceed to visit the popular Haeundae beach after the temple. 
One of the must visit places in Busan,"A very nice temple facing the sea. Many tourist and locals. I took the Busan city tour (BUTI) blue line to this place. I dont read Korean and there were no signs to direct me but I asked a local who gave me directions. It was not difficult to locate, just a 6-8 mins walk from the BUTi bus stop. You could ask the bus driver when you disembark or ask anyone by giving the name Haedong Yonggungsa. If you are taking the city bus do explore the other stops on the blue line as well."
A temple located at sea level,"Said to be unique in that it is the only Temple built at sea level. It is a large site that has a very impressive Temple and an eclectic mix of figurines of all types spread across the various levels, including among the impressive topiary."
Fresh air,When you go there in winter you will feel the fresh air while enjoying the beautiful temple. Quite far from city of Busan by bus and their is only few bus for this destination. We should wait for long time to go back home from here because there are only several bus
Something beautiful made into a fairground attraction ,"The location of this temple near the see is unique and beautiful. Unfortunately the place is overcrowded and worst of all it is stuffed with all kinds of statues which don't belong there. If it hasn't been free of charge, I would have asked back my money. "
Another experience of Korean Buddhist temple,"A temple nicely located along a rocky coast and its entry disguises the lovely settings. Luckily, late afternoon, not many visitors and good space to move around to see all of the various features of the temple. Facing water and backed by a hill, very good for a temple to be in such a good position!!"
Nice but Crowded.,"Im not sure if it was just the day I was there but sheesh. Buses filled the parking lot. Crowds filled the small walkways. Look...its fantastic. Just super busy. Took away from the tranquil vibe I was looking for. Not too large or ornate, but a spectacular setting (despite the condos going up across the bay). You can tell it would be a fantastic place to spend some time and find some inner peace. So go, but go early (or late?) and you won't be pushed out of the way by the 70 year olds led by a tour guide yelling at them to hurry up."
Really beautiful setting for a temple,"I really liked visiting this Temple in Busan. The whole setting next to the ocean was really pretty and you can take really beautiful pictures here. Even though there was a lot of people visiting this temple during the summer holidays, it was still worth seeing."
Beautiful Temple with Sea view,Haedong Yonggung Temple is one of the most beautiful temples I had visit in Korea. Offer amazing seaview & scenery. The architecture is kind of Japanese-style. But yet unique in its own way.Abit disappointed because I didn't get to see the temple light up lanterns (which only can be see during their festive). However the beautiful coastline make up as I didn't expect it to be so amazing.The route to the temple may be inaccessible for some people as you need to climb many stairs. Do note that currently the temple is undergo some renovations.
Temple with scenic view,The temple was sitting on a cliff with nice view and I think that's what make it special. Temple itself was quite small but it was surrounded by crystal clear water. Can be reached by public transport but need to take some time. 
Haedong Yonggung Temple,"Although we arrived in the middle of the day and there were plenty of tourists around, our trip to the temple was enjoyable and interesting. The vendors lining the walkway to the temple itself offer a variety of local crafts and street food. This unique temple is an insight into the religion and the culture of South Korea. The location on the rocky cliffs overlooking the small bay, though not breathtaking, is nonetheless impressive and beautiful. As first time visitors to South Korea, we would certainly recommend making the effort to visit."
Worth the visit,"A nice temple that is on the sea shore. Very nice scenery, interesting god statues, wishing pond etc. It should take about 2 hours to walk through the whole area.Recommended for those who likes visiting temples. There is a shop that sells souvenir too."
One of the only temples on the sea shore in Korea,"This is a change from the many similar temples found in Korea (similar in the overall scheme, but the fact that it is situated on the shore, near the rocks, makes it unique). Worth a visit."
Unexpected access to the stone-pile-pagodas,"It wasn't a bad place but I think the excellent reviews made me expect too much. Or maybe it was because the bridge was under construction when I went there (2015), or maybe because I was disappointed to find out that those majestic stone-pagoda-cone-thingies by the ocean are not accessible to visitors (or is it? ;D ). It's a temple compound like the others but by the sea-- I guess that's its unique characteristic. I wanted to view the sunrise that's why I left from Busan stn at around 530am, I arrived at the Yonggungsa bus stop at around 620am. It was still drizzly so there's goes my sunrise XD From the bus stop, you need to hike up the road to the temple, ~10mins? Not sure if it's because of my early time, or it being a weekday, or it's drizzly, or it's winter, or maybe the combination of all, but I managed to avoid the crowd. At the time, there was only about 2-3 other groups in the area. I was trying to figure out how to get to those stacked-up stone pagodas by the cliff, and gave up once I realized that the whole area is walled up :(And so, after about an hour, I decided to leave and proceed to my next agenda which is taking a walk by the coastal trail. While doing so, I saw a trail by the cliff which I figured would lead me back to Yonggunsa, which it did :D After 30 mins of hiking, I was walking outside the temple walls, and up-close and personal with the stone piles. At first, I was worried that perhaps I wasn't supposed to be there but the metal railings, stairs, view decks, and even mini-Buddhas in the area made me realize that may not exactly be the case. On my way back, I discovered the road leading directly to one of the temple's gate but it was locked. I'm not sure if this is just a temporary lock out but it was certainly accessible before. One of the stone pile is in ruins, perhaps they're just trying to renovate it (Ooops?). So for me, it was a trip that started in disappointment but ended in an exciting note :)I got there by taking bus no. 1001 from Busan station, and getting off at “Songjeong Haesu Yokjang Ipgu” (송정해수욕장입구). Then walk ~100m towards the intersection to transfer to bus no. 100 from Seojeong bus stop, then getting off at Yonggunsa-- I got off at 동부산관광단지 bus stop."
ONE OF THE MORE BEAUTIFUL TEMPLES IN ALL OF SOUTH KOREA,This is a unique temple as it is on the coastline and offers very beautiful scenery and you can't help but marvel at the architecture.
Nice temple by the cliffs,The place is a very lovely walk and views are amazing. There's a mail box where you can send postcards and letters from this area so do take advantage of that as well. There are street food stalls before going into the walk to the cliffs and there's also an area where you can throw coins for good luck.
Temple nearby ocean,"Visit on Saturday, crowded with people. There are some stalls selling food and souvenir before you enter the temple. Quite a nice temple. Worth a visit."
Serenaded by the Waves,"Haedong Yonggung Temple in Busan is situated right next to the Pacific Ocean. Unlike many temples in Korea that are usually situated in the mountains, it's built right along the sea. It's easily accessible by in Busan by bus or there are tours that you can also join. Leading into the front entrance, there are a variety of small shops selling souvenirs and many food stalls so if you are feeling hungry after the climb, you can stop and buy some wonderful street food. Now for the temple, it's a very serene walk, though definitely rocky. It is highly advisable that you pay attention, as the steps are very very steep, and it would be easy to slip and fall. There are also many of the local people who live near the temple who come and pray at the temple, so it is better to make sure you aren't getting in the way of them. Make sure to bring along shoes with lots of traction, and cameras to take pictures because it's a photographers dream. No trip to Busan is complete without a visit to this temple on the sea~"
Best temple in Busan ,"This was a great day trip! The temple is really beautiful, interesting, lots to see.There is a local bus which takes you there from the metro, and from the bus station it's a 10 min walk.The temple itself is a complex of many stairs so if you don't walk very good, re consider going there.Don't eat near the temple, eat near the metro station (-:"
One of the best!,"This has been my favorite temple visit so far during my Korean stay. It's situated right on the shore and overlooks the sea. There's a great story behind the temple as you walk in if you take the time to read through its history, and there are plenty of statues and different things to see while you're there. It is a little out of the way in Busan, but a bus drops you right near a stop that starts your walk towards the temple and there is a shuttle that will get you there from one of the nearby subway stops. This is a can't miss if you're into visiting temples and are in the Busan area!"
Temple with a seaview,The walk to the temple was worth it as the overall view was simply fantastic. Photo enthusiasts will have opportunities to practice their photography prowess.
Beautiful Temple,We visited this beautiful temple using a local bus. It was easy to get to and well worth a visit. It was very windy the day we visited but the location of the temple is really special. The temple faces the sea and because it was windy the sea was roaring.There is no entrance fee and the atmosphere is really special with soft music playing in the temple.At the entrance there are statues of the zodiac signs found in the Chinese calendar. There are convenient seating areas around this area as well.
Temple by the sea..,"Haedong Yonggungsa Temple was really worth visiting - the only temple we saw during our trip around South Korea along the coastline. Set into the rocky shore, it has a very different layout to other temples, but much of the same architectural design. The immaculate gardens and quirky little monk statues were fascinating. Some really good photo opportunities here!"
unique temple located on oceanside.,this temple is unique because of its location sitting on the rocks of the beach. It is got a nice view to look at ocean but it makes a lot of walking to get to this temple.
Nice even on a rainy day,"Even on a rainy day it was a nice walk. Very picturesque temple, I think that on a sunny day it would be superb."
Very busy!,We visited on a holiday weekend and it seemed as though everyone else had the same idea. Nevertheless it is a nice seaside temple. There are some cliffs you can sit on and overlook the temple/people watch. There are some vendors heading into the temple as well~ we purchased heoddak (little pancakes) to try. They were a nice treat. 
Interesting temple,"Lots of tourists, so doesn't really have the serenity of an actual temple, but well worth the visit."
Beautiful seaside temple,Easy to get to on metro & bus. Not a difficult walk. Lots of food stands. A pleasant 1/2 trip. Stop by the largest mall in the world on your way back to the city. Metro stops at the mall.
Temple with lots of Statues,"It was a nice temple, right after you enter it, you will see a lot of statues there. There was the 12 Chinese Zodiac Statues, Pagoda Statue, and others right after the entrance. Inside you can see the beautiful temple, and on the bridge before the temple, people used to throw coins in a stone pot, when the coins get inside, they said your wish will come true. This temple have a sea view."
Beautiful temple,"Be prepared for stairs. There spot where you can stop and catch your breath if needed, so you can take you time to get down to the temple. Just remember what goes down must walk back up the stairs. This is called the dragon temple. It is right on the cliffs. You can pose for a photo with your horoscope. This is a must see."
Buddhist temple in Busan,"Beautiful temple with a nice view to the ocean. Free entrance. There is also fresh, clean water to drink at one of the underground temples coming from the mountains. Worth a visit"
Temple with Seaview,"With beautiful scene, it's so relaxing to enjoy the seaview. At there, you may drink the water at one of temple that has a healing effect of all kinds of illness. Believe or not?"
Best Temple in Korea,"Been here multiple times (Whenever my friends have visited I have taken them here)Its a bus/taxi ride from Haeundae (if you get the bus you have to walk up towards the temple)Getting there you walk through a small street market selling the typical Buddhist gifts and also food stalls. After that you walk through the street with the Zodiac animals then down the a few steps to the temple. It can get a bit busy/slow on the steps depending on the time of day.You can walk over the bridge and look around the temple area, go inside the temple, down into a cave area to light a candle.Also up some steps on the left side of the temple will give you an incredible view over the temple area and looking out towards the sea (Shame about the construction work in the background!)A really beautiful place."
Beautiful temple,"Beautiful scenery, fine carvings. We went the day after Chusoek, it was very crowded. Delicious grilled squid. There are a lot of stalls to get food while entering the temple.. "
Buddhist temple,"if a tourist wants to experience how people praise Buddha then its a right place to visit. there is everything: music is playing, burning incense, people praying in the temple and the atmosphere is very ancient i felt a bit uncomfortably don't know whymaybe cause I'm christian. anyway the place is worthy to visit ✌"
A beautiful temple that worth your time,"It not that direct to reach but also not that hard, take subway, change bus, then walk, a beautiful temple will appear in front of you. In order to walk from the entrance until the main temple, need a little bit more of walk (going down the staircase), although need a lot of walk, but the scenery is worth the price. Facing sea, nice breeze on a summer afternoon."
Interesting Must Visit,"This temple is located at a nice location,use bus service 181 from Haeundae Subway.takes 45 minutes and then a 10 minute walk.Be prepared for some walking around the temple.Its a nice view and gets good visitors."
Worth the drive!,"We went to Busan for a beach vacation and wanted to add some sightseeing to our itinerary. This temple was a bit out of the way so we stopped here on out way out of town and it did not disappoint. The grounds are clean and there is so much to see. There are also vendors outside to buy souvenirs, drinks, and snacks. This is not stroller friendly, but for the most part an moderate walk/hike. There are a lot of stairs for little ones, but it's worth it. "
Beautiful,A long walk. Beautiful temple at the beach side. There is a trail walk to go to another beach (can't recall the name). The weather was good. The public toilet was very very bad. 
"Over-run with tourists and shops, not worth the drive","We went on a cruise-ship excursion but this was a big disappointment - absolutely mobbed with tourists. After seeing several lovely shrines and temples, this one had no serenity. Just look at pictures and skip the visit! It has been re-built, and definitely felt like it was there just to make money from tourists. The entry has a long path of vendors and stalls selling street food and kitschy souvenirs - perhaps it was because we were there in August, though we did not have this experience at many other holy sites. Definitely not worth the price or time to get there."
Amazed!,I saw photos of the temple online and decided to go there. After parking your car you walk through a small market. Once inside the main compound you'll see figures of Chinese zodiac. Steep stair steps take you up to the temple by the see. It was mind-blowing and awesome fun!
By the sea,A temple by the sea is always something såecial. Just outside the temple area are a lot of streetfood oportunities. 
Temple on Sea Level?,"Usually temples are built at higher levels, therefore this one that is at sea level is quite something else."
First thing I saw in Korea,"This temple was so beautiful that it gave me shivers. I have seen many giant temples and pagodas, but this cliff-side temple is the most majestic one so far. The old Korean architecture is just incredible. Remember to drink the cold and refreshing fountain water for good health! Also, they sell silkworms on the way in, so if you want to try something new, go for it!!"
Seaside Temple with Beautiful Vistas,"I took my family here when they visited Busan, and they all loved it. It's a little bit of a mix of nature and temple. There is no entrance fee, but they do have places for donations around the temple area. The reason I only gave it 4 out of 5 is because it is a bit out of the city. There's a couple ways to get there. You can take a taxi from Haeundae for about $25 or take bus 181 from Haeundae Station. You'll get off the bus after the stop for the Lotte Outlets. Then, follow the signs up the hill to the entrance area. It's a bit of a hike, but it's not too far. If you take a taxi, they can bring you up to the entrance area. The entrance area has a parking lot and a few food stands. The pathway to the temple is lined with stores selling souvenirs, food, and other items. There is also a souvenir store at the temple with proceeds going to maintain the temple. The pathway is lined with trees and plants after the shops. There are long sets of stairs to get to and from the temple. The stairs split and lead to an overlook of the sea on one side and the temple on the other. Upon reaching the bottom of the stairs, there is a bridge. If you look to the right, you will see a bowl to try and throw coins in for good luck. We had a lot of fun doing this.The temple has the normal buildings, but it also has a huge golden buddha statue. If you climb another set of stairs, their is a huge statue of the goddess of fortune. This overlooks the temple and the ocean. I highly recommend going here for a visit if you get the chance. Just make sure you know how to get there before going. Also, on the way back from the temple is a good chance to do some outlet shopping as long as you're there."
A must see. Beautiful panoramic views from top,Food and souvenier gift stalls at the beginning. Statues of all zodiac signs with their chinese meanings. Beautiful viewpoints on your way up. Panoramic seaview from the outside of the temple. You can buy souveniers at the top with monk blessing it.
A must see in Busan,"I have been to Busan a few times and this temple still remains one of my favorites to visit and suggest to others. Yes, it has gotten a little commercial with many tour groups and souvenir stalls, but it doesn't take away from it's beauty. Best to visit as early as possible as many tour groups arrive around lunch time. Also the afternoons get very hot and there are not many covered sitting areas to get shade.Best to skip on rainy days as steps and rocks could be quite slippery.You must walk some steep steps to get to and from the temple, as far as I know there are no alternative routes, so keep this in mind for those unable to use stairs.There are many stalls selling drinks and snacks as well as a few restaurants, so no need to worry about food.There are local buses that go here, but like others have mentioned they drop you on the main road and you must walk about 10 or more minutes partially uphill to arrive at the temple complex.There is good parking here but you must pay. 3,000won for small/medium cars and 7,000 for large cars.The temple is free other than parking.Tips:Make sure to walk out onto the rocks to get a better view of the temple as a whole.If you want to see the temple covered in lanterns like many internet pictures show it, you must come during the lunar new year in late winter/early spring."
A Temple Must go when in Busan,The trip to Haedong Yonggung Temple is very simple. I took a train and transfer to bus from Bexco took me 45mins.I went there early with my wife and there are lesser people but not much store open. Tourist bus reaches around 10am. The view of the temple is nice as it is facing the sea. 
""" Nice view """,Very beautiful temple by the sea. It's not reachable by metro so the only way to get here is by bus or taxi.Most Buddist Temples are up in the mountains but this one is unique as it is on the coastal beachside.Try to avoid weekends as this is a popular place to visit for locals on the weekends.The temple is really nice.Beautiful place that worth a visit in Busan. 
Nice but crowded,Nice temple by the sea. Take bus 181 from haeundae subway station or a taxi from that location for about 8500 won. In the summer heat the walk from the bus stop is a bit of a challenge. The temple is very nice but there are just too many people which takes the charm away a bit as far as I'm concerned. 
Haedong Yonggung Temple,"I went there on summer session. The place was beautiful with lot of thing to see and you can grab a lot of nice picture. Getting there with public transport, take a bus 181 or 100 at Heundea beach station. "
Temple with Stunning Seaview,"The temple is build on a cliff, but the place is well established (quite commercialize) that still possible for visiting that place with toddler. You can forget about stroller at this place and there are some stair cases that too stiff/high for toddlers to walk on their own. But, all in all it's achievable and the sea view over the temple is stunning."
A stunning place,The Haedong Yonggung Temple is a must for people travelling to Busan. The location is stunning being perched on a rugged coastline and it is amazing that such architectural feats could be accomplished. The buildings are great and the walks around the site are interesting with traditional Buddhist artifacts abounding.
Dragon temples,Best in the early morning. Can get the 181 or 100 bus from Haeundae. Worth a little walk around if you have time. Lovely to see a temple by the beach. The stores around the temple really charge extreme prices though. 
Best temple in Busan,"Though a little out of the way and at the northern limits of Busan, this temple is worth a visit. The natural surroundings being on a rocky coast, enhances the beauty of this temple. Thumbs up!Tip: I took Bus #9 from Huaendae Station Exit 7 bus stop to this temple. Cost only krw 1100 pp."
Beautiful scenery ,This was such a beautiful scenery of the temple and ocean. We took so many pictures. Do wear comfortable shoes there is a alot of walking and stairs. There was no charge to get in. They do have food booths. We took a bus to get here from our hotel. It was busy and crowded because it was a weekend. I would go back and visit.
Interesting seaside temple,We had a car during our visit and my wife suggested visiting this temple on our way out of town. We were there about 10:30 AM on a Monday and there were a good number of people but not really crowded. Beautiful location. Recently constructed bridge. Nicely kept buildings and grounds. Stayed for about an hour.
Relaxing peaceful place,"Enjoyed the scenery and must see place while visiting Haeundae beach. We took the BUTI Shuttle bus tour which tour around Busan City. Only 15, 000 won a person. "
Breathtaking views,"My mother and I came during the rainy season which slightly downgraded our experience. However, the views are absolutely stunning. I would say that even the pictures cannot capture the temple's beauty. The transportation was a bit annoying since it is at the far end of Busan. You can either ride the bus or taxi to get there. Being our usual lazy selves, we chose the taxi. There's also some walking needed to head to the temple from the parking lot. Nevertheless, the long trip was worth it! I already knew this temple was going to be a beauty before I even came. The fogs certainly make it look like it's heaven. "
Beautiful temple,"A very beautiful temple by the sea. It's not reachable by metro so the only way to get here is by bus or taxi. It's only about 20-30mins bus ride from Haeundae station to Yonggungsa. A beautiful place that worth a visit in Busan. Other than that, they probably need more maintenance and cleaning for their toilets. It's the worst in hygienic so far for the toilets I have went in Korea. "
Amazing views,This temple was one of the highlights that I was looking forward to seeing while in Busan. It sure didn't disappoint us. We got on the bus from Haeundae to get to this temple. The bus ride in Korea can be a crazy experience just to warn you. The bus goes pretty fast and if you are standing up make sure you hold on really well because you will be swaying a lot. These bus drivers drive pretty similar to the taxi drivers. Once you get to the temple you have to go up a little hill. Before you actually go inside the temple there are people selling food and other things just like every other temples. There was quite a crowd of people so prepare for that. Overall this is a beautiful temple and you will not be disappointed.
Nice temple but small,"Well, i wad the only western guy there. The temple was nice but very small. Unique because it is really by the sea. Good experience but in 1h you are done."
"Great harmony between nature and culture, but flocks of tourists ruin in a bit","The temple is really nice, but it's by no means the biggest or the most beautiful one out there. But the backdrop is truly spectacular. The temple sits on top of rocks just above the sea and it feels like it is about to fall into the sea at some point. I visited in during the day, but I believe sunrise would be the best time to visit it as the light should be amazing. Another advantage of going early would be to avoid the tourists. I don't usually have too much of a problem with commercial places (rows of buses, small shops everywhere), but the problem with this place is that the tourists are also packed right in the middle of the temple (and not just on the parking lot or shops a bit away from the temple). This is especially problematic because since it's a temple, it's best enjoyed in a quiet and relaxing atmosphere, rather than having to slalom through the Chinese tourists taking pictures left and right. That alone won't ruin the experience, but it does get irritating a bit. So take that in mind."
Crowded,Only having seen 2 so far this was my least favorite. It was very crowded and seemed a lot more like a tourist site than an actual temple. There are some good places to get photos and is worth seeing if not just for the view over the water and statues
A small temple with sea backdrop,"This temple is a bit out of the way. There is no public transport to take you here other than taxi. The temple is located on a hilly area overlooking the sea. The whole complex is actually quite small and we covered the entire area within 45 minutes with ample rests! Due to this lack of size, this area could get very crowded. At the entrance, there is a row of animals made to represent each year of lunar calendar. There is also a relatively big statue of Goddess of Mercy at the highest point of this temple. If you are religious, you may want to spent more time with the spiritual feel of the place."
Very commercial,Some scenic views but seems very commercial and large banners blocking the facade of the temple so that it spoils the image of the temple being a place for religious purposes. Only saw one monk.Many places to get good luck with places for ppl to donate.
Beautiful view ,"Granted, the place was not big and there wasn't much to explore in the area, but it was beautiful to see a temple constructed on the cliff. A half hour bus journey from Hundae station and slight hike up to reach the temple but we were happy we went."
Suitable for an early morning visit,"The temple was by the sea. We arrived at around 9am and there were already quite a lot of tourists around. There were a few statutes, some of which were quite big and all the scriptures were in Traditional Chinese characters. The rocks served as an extended platform out to the sea and the view was magnificent. There is a designated place to watch sunrise as well, and it may be better to arrive earlier to avoid the crowds and even watch sunset."
A must in busan,"This place is highly recommended by tourist, so it was in our top rank 'must visit' place in Busan. Went there and its well worth the visit. A temple at the beach side is rare. The stunning view of temple along side the ocean makes it an unique temple from the rest. The only complain is their toilet. In fact its the worst among the toilets we went in korea."
Beautiful Seaside Location,"I really enjoyed this temple even though it was super crowded. The location right next to the sea makes it unique from other temples. It is possible to get there via public transportation but it did take awhile. I ended up taking the metro to the Haeundae Station exit 7 and caught bus 181. It took about a hour to get there as traffic was terrible. As others have mentioned, get off the bus after the Lotte Mall. As you exit the bus go to the right you will see to your left signs about the temple. Go left and walk up the the hill and follow the signs--you cannot miss it as it is well marked.There are a lot of stairs going down to the temple and of course one must come back up all of the stairs. It was hot and crowded and I am glad I had bought some water walking to the temple as I needed it! Make sure you visit the area where you can get a view of the front of the temple. The actual temple is fairly small but the location was very beautiful.When you leave the temple you will find food and souvenir stands. I had a great donut like item --deep fried dough with a brown sugar/cinnamon and nut filling--it was delicious and hit the spot. I went back out to the main road and caught the 181 bus back to Haeundae Station--you will find the bus stop it on the other side of the street."
Stunning temple on the mountain side,The location alone is worth the visit...perfectly perched on the cliff side of the mountain with forest and seas protecting the temple and Buddha. It was the first thing I put on the must see list for S Korea and it didn't disappoint.
Beautiful waters,"It's a fairly small and out of the way place, but it's an easy bus ride from Haeundae station. If you have the time, there's a nice seaside walk you can take from the temple after crossing a little red bridge.The color of the ocean was gorgeous."
Amazing temple by the sea,"I love this temple. I went two times, once in April and again in the fall the following year. The first time it was decorated for Buddha's birthday with multi colored lanterns hanging everywhere. I recommend taking a cab from Busan to the temple early in the morning before it gets crowded or hot. There are plenty of cabs that wait outside the temple to take people back to the city. Bring water to stay hydrated."
Breath-Taking South Korea Bucket List Item,"Most Buddist Temples are up in the mountains but this one is unique as it is on the coastal waters! Easy to get to and almost brought me to tears at first view. I am not Buddhist but enjoyed wandering around with my kids and learning more about the history of this location, the traditions and rituals of Buddhism and seeing people in worship. It is quite a bit of stairs (for those who need to consider that in your trip planning) but my four kids (ages 4-11) enjoyed all the exploring around the temple grounds to see the different statues, paths and even a cave. Things to be aware of: The restrooms are squatty potties and are the worst smelling place I have been in Korea. There is a coffee shop on the walk way down to the temple that has a normal (and VERY clean) bathroom to use if you aren't into squatties.This is a working temple so they want guests to be quiet and respectful. I heard kids being scolded for being too loud so keep that in mind if traveling with your family but don't let it stop you from coming. We played the whisper game to help remind the kids and it worked like a charm.There is one small concession stand at the actual temple so if you go on a hot day and need cold water, you can buy it there for 1000kw. Go early to avoid crowds and the heat of the day. Wander the entire grounds. It really is beautiful!! Enjoy!"
Beautiful view and away from crowd,"Nice temple by the sea away from the crowded areas. The structures are beautiful. There are some stalls along the way to the temple which one can buy food and snacks. It's a great place for photos too. Fortunately it was not that crowded when we were there. For tourist, it's better to take a taxi as it is a bit far from the Busan city area. Along the way, we chanced upon a Lotte mall outlet."
Must Visit!,"Very nice temple by the sea. Not sure how old is the temple but it looks quite old and the architecture, design, carvings, statues, etc. looks quite old. Nice peaceful environment with a great view of the sea and the many rock formations. Take an interesting stroll pass roadside stalls selling street food and all kinds of souvenirs and other items on the way in/out of the temple. The street is also lined with many statues as you approached the temple and after descending some steps you will cross a stone bridge to reach the temple proper. I rate it as a ""must visit"" place for visitors to Busan."
Great temple now too busy from the mall,"this used to be my favourite place near Busan. However, since the development of the surrounding area created a surge of people heading out there every weekend, the lst has worn off a little. Don't let this put you off. If you are willing to wake up for sunrise this temple will give you a great view in a relatively peaceful setting. Just get out before the morning crowds come."
"Beautiful views, but way too crowded","It was very crowded, as in the really-packed-with-almost-no-moving-space sort. Inching forward slowly down the narrow stairs towards the temple and back up wasn't quite what I had in mind. Then again, it was a Saturday. The temple itself is crowded too, and we climbed up to get a better view at the top before getting out of there. The temple itself is very well-maintained, and if it wasn't for it being such a overrated touristy place this might have gotten a better review. "
What a place to build a temple! ,"On a touring holiday of Asia we thought we had had enough of temples. However the location of this one is unique. Situated right on the cliff tops overlooking the sea, it's wonderful. Got plenty of great pictures, lots of colour around. This is a must if you get the chance."
Grand temple by the sea,"Lovely location by the sea. Swarmed with people though, even though I went on a weekday. Used the subway+bus to get here. It was quite a distance to walk in, so if you have problem walking, you might consider taking a cab here directly."
Located near the sea,Walking from the coach park down to the temple there are many shops and food sellers. During the ten minute walk down there are large Chinese Zodiac statues and other things to view.
One of the worlds few buddhist temples situated close to the ocean,Lovely buddhist temple with a nice hike up and down the rocky beachside. Stroll through the small entrance pathway and listen to the buddhist monk as he conducts his prayers. Walk around and Watch - lots of small things to see. Sample some local food on the way to the temple. Try to avoid weekends as this is a popular place to visit for locals on the weekends.
My now most favorite temple in Busan,"I did not know what to expect when i went here, and i was very happy i took the time and effort to get here. The temple is beautiful, it sits above a rocky shore. There are chinese zodiac sculptures, there are stone Buddhas carved into stone and as free-standing statues, there are temple halls, there are walking trails. There was a live broadcast of a monk chanting, and it was contributing to the atmosphere of a sacred place. It felt sacred to me. I wish i had more time here. The scenery is awe-inspiring. Since i got here around 5pm, the crowds were thin, and vendors were packing up. I love this temple, there was something profoundly moving about it for me."
beautiful scene,"the temple itself is average like other temples but the surrounding view is great especially on a windy day! the breeze and wavy sound from the ocean is just so soothing, one feels relax and serene, more so as we are city people! I love the smell of the grilled seafood along the road leading to the temple but for some maybe just too pungent! few small stalls to entice you if you are looking for crafts to bring home. worthy of a half day visit..............."
Beautiful on a sunny day cliff/sea located Buddhist temple,Worthy of a gentle half day small but lovely location Buddhist temple. Enhanced further with the hanging of hundreds of paper lanterns leading up to celebration of Buddha's birthday.
Unique temple ,Crowded temple. Unique..and nice view too.many vendor asking the way so no problem with food. Bus took us outside and it's around another 10min steep walk. So be prepare to walk. 
Nice view,Windy because of the sea but amazing view:)Better rent a car because have to transfer two times..
Beautiful temple don't miss,"Temple located 20km from Busan, on a mountain near the sea. Fantastic scenery, very nice Buddha statues, few are quite huge. Don't miss if you are in Busan area."
Worth the walk unique temple nestled in to the cliff,From the parking lot it's quite a long walk down to the temple with lots of steps. But it's well worth the walk.On the way you pass some market stalls then different statues. After walking over the bridge try your luck tossing a coin into the lucky pot. It's quite a throw. It's separated into several areas with a few Buddhas in different areas. The stone domes are nice.It was lovely to see all the brightly coloured lanterns strung across every where.Yes it's not as spectacular as some temples but it's well worth making the effort. There's not many temples that's are nestled on the cliff side.
Definitely worth with to visit,"Although it take a bit time to travel to but definitely is worth it. How to go to Haedong Yong Gung temple - Haeundae station - exit 7 to take bus No:181 around 15-20mins to the temple. Alight the bus when You see a rock statue with ""Haedong Yong Gung "" on your right.  Temple is small but at the cliff side form a spectacular view. Taking picture at the Buddha, there is a red bridge bring you to Fishery Science museum, it's free. Estimated visit duration 1-2Hour"
Small temple in a nice location,"Not everything you see in Asia has to be grand to be worth visiting. Haedong Yonggung sa is a modest temple in a nice location by the sea. The bus ride from Haeundae Station takes only 15-20 mins and the bus drivers are helpful to tourists. The temple itself is small and charming and peacefully located. As long as you aren't looking to be blown away with opulence this makes for a nice, casual visit."
Incredible temple with an awesome view,"It is as incredible as the pictures you will find on the web. The location of the temple on the coast is breath taking and picturesque. However, once there, there is not much in terms of other activities. Though walking to the temple is a walkway filled with street vendors selling various souvenirs and street food. I would highly recommend partaking in some of the food. Great fishcake/soup as well as pretty legit ddokpokki. There is also a great hillside road which connects the temple to Haeundae Beach. The road has several restaurants and bars overlooking the cliffs, which is a great place to stop by for lunch/drinks. "
Interesting Temple in amazing natural surroundings,"It was an interesting visit . I was so surprised to find an old traditional temple in amazing natural surroundings . The views are great ! Lots of lovely cute small shops on the street leading to the temple . Try to avoid weekends and public holidays , it can get very busy ."
A world away from busy Busan,Simply beautiful - worth the pretty and interesting walk. We were the only Americans in sight and everyone was so polite and helpful. We were even stopped by an elderly couple and THANKED for what America did for South Korea during the war!Amazing
Another Temple ?,Another temple visit created to charm tourists. Looking around I guess the temple is newly built. I imagine the site will be lovely at night with all the artificial LED lights.
Ok but not as impressive as was claimed,"The entrance to this place was far too touristy and was filled with hawker stalls. It was a short 400 m walk up and down the steps to the temple. The hoards of people have overtaken the peace. The only attraction here was a temple located by the coast. I find the Beomeo-sa Temple (up in the hills) to be a much more serene place, with more nature tracks and peace."
"One hundred and eight steps to the temple, but well worth it.Then back up again!","A private guide is recommended for this trip as there are many stories that need to be told of this place. It is amazing. Built right at the sea, the temple has many areas to be visited. Not suitable for wheel chairs or people on crutches (too many steps)."
Not as good as I'd heard,"Yes, the location is stunning (apart from the Ministry of Fisheries building built next to it), but the place was packed. Fast food and clothes stalls lined the entry area and scaffolding was all over the place - presumably in advance of the lantern festival, but it really made the place uninviting. Only saw one monk, who was praying, and no other obvious guides or information around the place. Disappointing visit."
Really cool views,"The temple had really cool views and was great to see. The area it is located is more impressive than the temple, but still a great visit!"
A nice short stay after lunch around,"We paid for this excursion as an optional addition to our packaged tour for Busan and around for cherry blossom season. Nobody from the group appeared to have any idea about this place before. It was a good choice to go for anyway as the walk about is not too difficult apart from a few short flights of stairs along the slope and most people other than those with back or walking problem should find the walk not an issue. The Buddhist buildings in this zone are not too different from those larger Buddhist temples in Korea except that there are a few distinguishing features such as smaller area, a short bridge with good sea view and a slope down the bridge for those who believe in attracting good fortune with a throw of coin into the designated holes of rock sculptures, an open area for donation in exchange for writing on a copper tile for good luck and a small cavity for tasting the water for the claimed healing effect. There are a series of buddhas for worshipping, including 5 small ones for academic achievement wishes. Quite a few spots inside are good for photography and Buddhists to see. The pagoda right outside the main entrance and the path leading up to that entrance also have some other interesting rock sculptures (eg the 12 animal signs for the 12 lunar years of birth) and cherry trees which will satisfy tourists of different interests too. There are street hawkers selling local and imported souvenirs including wood carvings, local agricultural produce and Korean eateries for lunch."
Fascinating Temple in Lovely Location,"This temple is worth the time to visit. You will walk through market stalls on the way to start of temple. Please be careful if you are disabled or cannot climb steps as there are many, steep steps here. Being on the coast it is a lovely location. about 3/4 hour from city depending on traffic"
A Very Special Place,"The Haedong Temple is a spiritual experience and a truly worthwhile visit. Nestled on the cliffs facing the sea the temple has a tranquility feel and although there are lots of visitors, its easy to experience the importance of the place. Some interesting souvenir shops are at the entrance along with some local foods."
Nice view of the sea from the temple,"Love it when you hear the sea wave and feel the peacefulness of the temple. Unlike other temples, this temple by the sea is a trip worth to go. I enjoy the scenery. You may want to wear proper shoes as there is a distance to walk and stairs to climb if you are taking a bus. "
Cultural Immersion,This temple was a great place to learn about Korean culture. It was beautiful and peaceful. Great place to eat local food.
Beautiful Temple,"This was our very first attraction on our long trip to Korea. We took a taxi from Haeundae area and it took about 20mins to get there. There are rows of stall outside the entrance of the temple and you would be greeted by the 12 zodiac animal statues. Its a short rocky step down before reaching the scenic bridge that overlooks the temple and the coast line. Some construction work was going on during the time of my visit. Hence, we only stayed for about 30mins before heading out. Taxis are easily available outside of the attraction. Not a problem for tourist visiting the temple. "
Stunning View,"Probably the most amazing temple we visited in our S. Korea Trip, the sea hitting the rocks, the temple on the background, is just the perfect photo...."
stunning except for...,This seaside temple isn't a common site in mountainous temple South Korea. I think its gorgeous except for all the trash laying around. It's really an eyesore and detracts from the area's natural beauty and scenery. It's out of the way in Busan but worth a visit for a unique temple experience.
Unique Korean Seaside Temple,If you've been in Korea long it's easy to get templed out so it was refreshing to visit this unique temple located by the sea. It is a bit out of the way about a 30 min bus ride from Haeundae station but worth the trip. 
Beautiful View!,The temple built along the ocean and it was a nice visit. It looked pretty new compared to other temples I visited while I was in Korea. 
refreshing view,the location is not common in Korea.. usually temples can be found in mountains but this temple is right beside sea..Busan City Tour Bus runs several times a day 
Beautiful temple,It's not a really large temple but we had a tour guide that explained a lot of the temple stuff to us. A very beautiful and interesting temple. I enjoyed my visit. 
Beautiful and Interesting,"This is one of the few temples in Korea built on the coast instead of in the mountains, which makes it pretty special. Definitely worth checking out."
Pretty temple,Visited together with collegaues on a business trip. The temple is situated with view over the sea on a hill.There are quite few stairs to walk to get to the temple.Before comming to the temple you pass many small street shops.
Beautiful & Peaceful,Beautiful Temple right on the water with artistic and cultural heritage. This temple is unique and definitely a must see for all. Highly recommend!
It's really built on the edge!,"This is a real cool temple to visit. Not too difficult to reach. I found my way there by taking a bus on the bridge near Nampo Station. Around 20minutes if I remember correctly. Don't worry about missing the stop as the bus will announce the name of the temple, but you gotta open your ears though. You don't see it immediately when you get off, but just follow the road sign by crossing the road and walk further in. There'll be a simple market which sells food and souvenirs, then a stretch of zodiac statues. Just follow the way and wow... you'll see the sea (or should I say Ocean?) and turn slightly left and you'll see that famous view which you've come so far. It's really pretty! Lots of stairs to climb though so you gotta prep your elderly beforehand and see if they are willing to go. If you are hungry before or after you visit the temple, there's a restaurant on the main road which you will be taking the bus. Their Jajangmyeon is not bad, costing at... 5000/6000 i have forgotten (Not too cheap I know, but I thought the taste was actually not bad)."
Great view but out of the way,It's nice to see a temple by the sea since it has a different feeling to it when compared to other temples. It's rather small in comparison though. There are some vendors just outside of the temple which is nice as to check out as well. 
Beautiful,This was the first temple i was able to visit and i always recommend it to others. Its absolutely lovely. There is also a street market leading down to the temple with many different items. If you go on a holiday it will be very crowded
A tiny but beautiful temple!,"I try to visit Buddhist temples or Catholic churches (or whatever the dominant religion is) when I'm visiting a country because these religious establishments bear so much cultural, artistic and historic values of an era. So I was quite excited when I found out about this quaint temple nearby while visiting Busan, and it did not disappoint me. Haedong Yonggung Temple is a small temple located about 15 min taxi ride from downtown Haeundae. It is located right by the sea, and it seems to make the temple more tranquil and beautiful. It was a bit too touristy for my taste but it is quite picturesque, so if you want a nice day trip away from Haeundae beach, this place is definitely worth the trip. "
They're pretty much all the same,Most temples in Korea are very similar. This one is nice because it can be done fairly quickly and has great ocean views. A bit tricky to get back from though if there aren't any taxis on hand.
"Itw as nice, worth the trip as close by, but not if a detour","We went here by car, it was pretty easy drive and easy and cheap to park.Some nice food stalls on the path leading to the temple (shop around first, not all are as nice as the others).The temple itself is nice, but not overly nice.The area is also nice with a good view, but not superb.We enjoyed the snacks b the entrance more than the temple itself to he honest"
One of must-visit temple for visiting Busan,"It's second time for me to visit Busan but 1st time to Haedong Yonggung Temple. There are many local Korean visitors and seldom tourist there. It's a little bit far from the city but easy to access. As near the seaside so it's windy and in order to avoid get cold, please ensure you're wearing the proper & sufficient for sightseeing in winter. Suggest to spend half or a day in this area cause of it's close the Gijang Market & Lotte Mall Premium Outlets."
A beautiful and distinct temple,"I have visited many temples in many places. In Korea, after a few they all seem the same or very similar. Not this one! It's setting on the ocean side makes it really special and distinct. I'm so happy we visited it! We also did a small hike on some trails behind the temple that were nice and away from the crowds. Best to just take a taxi because it is faster. It cost 8,600 won from Haeundae. "
Enjoyed the tranquil peaceful grounds,"I am not one for buddhist artefacts but i did enjoy meandering the tranquil grounds lined with cypress and bamboo. The temple is scenic perched right next to the sea. Except for the above, there didnt seem to be much historical value. Its quite a distance from the main attractions, about an hours bus ride from Centum City Station. "
Touristy ,"Beautiful ocean views though our during our visit the weather was rather foggy n it rained. I didn't feel it was very authentic, I've been to many temples n this one didn't seem to be the original ... It's been around a long time but I didn't feel the ancient vibe. So many people!!! Not a great destination for little kids...no stroller access Lots of steep stairways, uneven walking paths n pushing through crowds of people. "
Nice visit with beautiful sights,"This place had gorgeous views of the sea. It wasn't too, too crowded at the time we went, but I assume it gets pretty packed in the warmer months. It was a tad bit touristy and didn't give off a very authentic vibe but again, great photo ops of the sea against the temple and rocks. Definitely grab yourself a 호떡 (Hotteok) from one of the many food vendors to warm you up, if visiting in the cold winter months!"
Pretty with a side of construction,The location of the temple itself is really pretty being right next to the cliff and is easy to get to if you take the city tour buses. But there was a lot of construction still going on at the temple 
Beautiful Scenery,"It was a great experience. Even though it has a pretty rough path to get there because you have to walk down the stairs, but the breathtaking view that you got at the end of the walk path will blow your mind. It will be a relaxing journey, and please do take your time here."
Serenity,This beautiful temple by the sea is something not to be missed. Although there can be crowds it is still a tranquil and serene place to visit. 
Fantastic place,Great place. We took a bus to get there and then a 10m walk to the entrance of the temple. Beautiful temple with amazing sea views. A must visit!
"Haedong Yonggung Temple, must see!","amazing tamale complex, located approximately 40 minute bus drive from the city center.the temple complex located on the cliff near the water that give the temple amazing atmosphere and view you can see the waves crashing on the rocks, and give you amazing view as you go from platform to platform.there is a lot of amazing Sculptures made out of stone, gold and wood.the temple itself is very pretty with amazing Korean architect.must see!at the entrance there are some small shops, for snacks Spices and offerings"
"Temple Was Just Okay, Location Was Great","The contrast of buddhist imagery and architecture with the sea is what makes this site worthwhile. The actually temple itself isnt all that amazing if you have seen your fair share of temples. I would imagine on a sunny day or on the weekend the crowds would be unbearable.All in all, beautiful sea view, beautiful temple, worth a look, but if you decide not to go you are not missing a lot."
Beautiful location.,"A medium-sized temple in a beautiful setting. More interesting that the temple itself is its location. You can clamber down the rocks to take pictures of the sea and the temple together. Very nice view.TIP: I highly recommend visiting the temple in the morning (before 12pm!) as the sun will be in a better position to take photos. In the afternoon, the sun begins to descend behind the temple making it difficult to take pictures due to the glare."
"Nice temple, although not amazing.","Went there on a weekend and there were a lot of people. The view by the sea was nice, but the temple wasn't as magnificent as the ones I have seen in Korea.There were works ongoing so we probably didn't experience everything here.It was by the sea and wind was super chilly! Lots of steps also, so therefore probably not very good for elderly. If u have been to haeinsa temple u can give this a miss. "
Beautiful Buddhist Temple on the Shoreline,"Need to do a short walk to the temple which is fun in a good weather. You will pass a hill of rock, full of wishing stones, which is beautiful for me.The temple itself is setting on a seaside makes it has spectacular view. I went there in hoping to make some beautiful photographs. But the timing was wrong. It was renovated and crowded of visitors. It was early January, where the people are usually pray for the beginning of new year.Getting there is easy. Take a BUTI Bus (Busan City Tour) from Haeundae BUTI Station for W1.500 only."
Beautiful site but reconstructed,"Beautiful temple by the sea with an interesting market at the entrance where you can try beetles and other strange local delicies. Though the site is definitely worth seeing, it has been recently rebuilt - if you have limited time in Busan, I would recommend Beomesa instead - older and more majestic "
Not worth the visit,"Over crowded, full of construction and the ocean is littered with fishing materials so it looks dirty. Not that much to see. Not worth the visit in my opinion"
Beautiful Views,There were lots of people visiting this site but the views of the sea were incredible. Love the Temple and the statues were wonderful to see.
Super windy but fun!,"I like visiting temples in different places in both Korea and Japan. This was no different. It was a bit out of the way but commuting was not a problem. There were lots of things to see like statues and the temple itself. Moreover, it has a killer view of the sea! The downside here is that since it's a very famous tourist destination, there are a lot of people and it feels like the sanctity of the area is gone."
High expectation not met,"We went here Oct 2015. The temple was under construction back then. The white bridge in front was knocked down and there was a crane and construction housing beside the temple. Really not what I was expecting to see. And It was a bit of a travel time by bus so we were really disappointed. The immediate vicinity of the toilets smelled, too. Hopefully by this time the construction is done. But yeah, what a disappointing trip for us."
Incredible,"As tourist attractions go, this is 100% worth your while, and even worth the hordes of people who will get in your way. This is not just a must see in Busan, but a must see for any trip to Korea. Such a beautiful place to visit. "
Amazing seaside temple ,Went to this amazing sea side temple. Amazing place for exploring and great photos. Worth visiting. Also lots of little local stalls leading to the temple. 
beautful view,get ready to hike a little bit leading to the temple. once you get off the bus there is a 10-15minute hike to the temple. maybe a taxi is available but most people just walk. there are taxis in the temple area so you can take them going down or to your next location.  views are breathtaking and we were lucky to sample pattjuk - red bean porridge for free. the ladies at the temple made them and people just queued to get their free bowl. ^^
"A ""don't miss"" if in Busan!!","We visited Haedong Yonggung Temple on Buddha's birthday. Wow- what an experience. Im assuming because it was a long weekend in Korea, and because of the nature of the holiday- it was EXTRA busy, but that definitely added to the experience. The place was full of Monks, worshippers there to celebrate the Buddha, and tourists alike. Though it was crowded, the atmosphere was so peaceful and tranquil (which is a lot to say for anything during a long weekend in Korea)! The amount of hanging lanterns was astounding, and the walk from the entrance to the temple was also beautiful. It is situated on rocky cliffs above the ocean, and there are so many little nooks and crannies to explore. An absolute must do if in Busan!"
A wonderful sight,"Breathtaking sights and the fresh air certainly helped to cleanse my mind. Chose this temple over Beomeosa, but certainly love to visit the latter next time.. "
Not Impressed,"Ok it was nice to go but it takes quite some time to get there on the bus and considering this temple is rated number 1 thing to do in Busan we were not impressed.I can imagine on a busy day the crowds will make this site very uncomfortable. Far, crowded and with very little to see is not my idea of a fun thing to do."
Peacefully temple by the sea,"Visit the temple around 4pm. Enjoyed some street food before the entrance , after that take a relax walk into the temple. The site is still under renovation, but the feeling of temple is still peacefully. Don't forget to drink some of the natural water from the there, Local says you drink a sip , get longelivity extra 3 years. Wait for sunset in silence is the best we can do ... Lovely day."
Beautiful ,We had a wonderful time on our visit to this temple. The view from the temple over the shoreline was amazing and the temple itself was beautiful. Adding to the experience is the long line of street venders and street food booths at the entrance.
Sunrise!,"Many people travel here for the sunrise. We went out at night and had a good time chatting on the beach, then took a late night taxi to the temple and waited a while for the sunrise. It is crowded, but not so bad. You can find a place to enjoy the view. "
Nice cliff side temple,Not too spectacular as there were constructions on going. Try to find the stairs down to the well behind the baby Buddha bath statue.
Diff from picture,I thought I would be able to see magnificent view but it turned out otherwise. Nothing really interesting except they have two water fountain that has natural spring water from the mountain. One part of the temple is currently under going upgrading. One thing you need to try is the taffy. Really good. 
Not your average temple,This temple has a unique seaside setting. You can get there by subway (Haeundae station) & bus. The bus goes into the outskirts of town & drops you by the roadside - watch out for the sign Haedong Yonggung carved on a big rock on your right side & get down here. A bit of a short uphill walk until the relaxing sound of waves greet you & you're there. The temples themselves are very colourful & photo-worthy. Good to go in the morning for a walkaround.
Nice to see,"This was a nice Christmas Eve afternoon plan. From Haeundae we decided to take a taxi and it was 8000 won, which is quite good for the distance, especially if you're sharing the ride. Part of the temple area is under construction and it's not the most beautiful temple ever but it's special in that it's right on the ocean. Lovely :)"
Nice temple with Great view,This temple has a great view of the ocean. It is fairly commercialized now and is very crowded. I was there in Nov 2015 and they are doing some restoration work. When it's done I'm sure it will look very nice.
One of oldest Temple - good view,"If you like temple than go for it, old and interesting if there is less crowd. The garden at the back is very unique with many more statue of Buddha. Pay attention on the design and motif of the door and the roof (very colourful and interest art)"
Beautiful Location,"Worth the trip to see this temple as the location is unique and beautiful.Take subway to Haeundae station exit 7 and bus stop is directly opposite.Take bus 181 for about 20 mins to Yonggungsa Temple stop which is just after the large Lotte mall on the left that looks like a castle.There are large brown signs in english before to let you know the temple stop is coming up,get off and cross road and follow the sign up road for about a 10 minute walk."
Love the scenery,Calm and peaceful with sea breeze. Good for photos. Took plentiful of them. Could be cold in winter though. 
Interesting and a must-see when inBusan,"Visited the temple in December and was pleasantly surprised by the simple beauty of it all. Although it was raining when we were there, it was still a lovely sight to behold. One of the few temples in Korea to be situated next to the ocean."
Beautiful place,"Travelling to this place was tough as it was quite a ride to the outer areas of Busan. However, the scenery was definitely rewarding! There were stairs and bridges within the temple. so the elderly might find it tough to explore the place. There were some interesting stores along the entrance selling snacks and souvenirs."
Temple with beautiful seaview ,"This is one of the listed hot tourist attractions in Busan. I went to this temple with my friend and we like the atmosphere and seaview a lot. There are a few ways of how you can get to this temple. If you stay nearby Busan station, take the subway from Busan station (부산역) at Line 1 (orange line) and transfer at Seomyeon station (서면역) to Line 2 (green line) and alight at Haeundae station (해운대역). Take exit 7 and walk to the bus stop 1 min away from the subway exit. Take bus no.181 and alight at Yonggungsa bus stop (용궁사). From there you walk straight and turn right where you can see the the hill. Walk up the hill till you see the entrance of the temple.Another way is to take bus no.1003 to Songjung (송정) and take a taxi from there to the temple. The taxi fare from Songjung bus stop to the temple is about 4000 won (depending on the traffic).In front of the entrance of the temple, there are a lot of street food and eateries nearby. You can take a quick bite or even have a meal after visiting the temple. I went to one of the restaurants nearby the temple and had 동태찌개. The owner was very friendly and nice, he gave us a lot of service food for free. The food is really tasty and if I were to visit this temple again, I would have my meal at the restaurant again.From the temple, the seaview is really nice. You can also pray sincerely to the Buddhas and make a wish. The temple closes at about 6pm or even before 6pm (and the sun sets early during winter). So go there early to ensure that you can enjoy the seaview and take a walk around the temple."
Loved it,"Go in the afternoon, around 3. It's less crowded and you can watch the sunset.It was a healing experience and I was glad we went. We left feeling at peace and relaxed. "
Historical Temple with plenty of tourist,"Out of a few places went, this temple probably is the one with most tourist i met during my stays in Busan. However it worth a visit for some Historical Temple / architecture views.Probably if not mistaken, this is also the only temple in Busan that never stop me (or any signboard) from taking photos on the buddha therein the temple. However to respect the Buddhist culture, i take no photos of the buddha in temple."
Not so enjoyable,Beautiful view by the seaside but it was overcrowded making my experience there less enjoyable than expected. The toilet stench was very unbearable and it spoiled the enjoyment of the temple
Nice location near the sea but surroundings a bit messy,"The location of the tempe is nice by the sea on a rocky cliff, but the surroundings are quite messy with plenty of stalls selling all sorts of things and inside the temple compound too it's quite messy, maybe because at the time of our visit they were preparing for a festival. The building of the temple itself has little architectural interest. it remains nevertheless a good excursion out of town within nearby distance. "
Sea Side Beauty,"The Haedong Yonggung is a small seaside temple located away from the bustling part of Busan although the temple still attracts many tourists and visitors. The water below the temple is littered with trash which taints the beauty of this place, but doesn't ruin the nice view."
Worth a visit,"The temple is certainly worth a visit, located on a cliff overlooking the sea. Beautiful woodwork and lots of different statues adorn the complex. Lots of walking so wear comfy shoes."
Beautiful ,I really enjoyed taking pictures in this temple. It's in front of the ocean so prepare yourself to get hit by the wind I went in august 2014 and it was very cold! As for the rest of south korea prepare your self to go up and down hills and stairs but it's totally worth it ♡♡There is a small local market down the hill 
A must go place though crowded with visitors,Go early in the morning to avoid crowd. We took subway and bus. Very easy to get there on yr own. Some parts under bridge under renovation but it is still worthwhile to go there. 
Very good,We can see a Buddhist Temple here.. this place is very cold because near a sea.. big temple with the wonderful scenery 
Temple on the cliff,"Listening to the wave washing the shore is what a refresh. This is a temple with great view and long history. Several trails nearby the temple can lead you to see the temple from different angle. In front of the main building, there's a cave you can downstairs to get fresh water which is very pure and sweet. (Hard to imagine there're fresh water nearby seaside). You can also experience the traditional toilet at the right hand of main temple building. They leave the dump flow into the ocean. Oops!!!!!But it's a pity that I saw several pagodas nearby but actually they are not reachable by taking the trail. Anybody know how we can get there?After leaving this temple, I went shopping at a 800 meter away Lotte Outlet, plenty of outdoor gears. Worthy to visit this outlet after temple. You can walk there, it takes less than 12 minutes.海東龍宮寺 值得一訪! 去完後記得到走路十幾分鐘可到的樂天暢貨中心(東釜山店)買東西。韓國的戶外用品店很齊全折扣又下很低，但是樂天超市每月的第二跟第四週的周日不營業。"
Spectacular views,"One of my favourite locations in Busan. I took the metro and then local bus to get there. After that, had to walk for around 20 minutes on a hilly road to finally reach the temple but is all worth it. The cool sea breeze on an autumn morning was very refreshing and relaxing plus the spectacular views of the waves crashing on the jagged rocks. A must go destination for tourists in Busan."
Definitely Exquisite,"Went here post New Year's day and yes we are prepared that this place would be crowded. Setting that aside. This temple is definitely rich with history. The scenery just gives great aesthetic delight to those who fancy historical and cultural places. One of the top places to go if visiting Busan. This temple is along shore lines of lustrous sea that makes the view even greater. It consists of different temples, very colorful and pleasing to the eye. A cave for making wishes, 3 story pagoda. big golden buddha/ golden pigs and all sorts of statues of twelve zodiacs and tiny monks. This place is open for the public and parking is available on site. Some shops and small stalls are along the way before you enter the temple that sells souvenirs and some food."
Visit in the early morning or during the week.,"CROWDED! If your looking to soak up the serenity of a temple on the sea, you should go in the morning during the week. It is beautiful, when the renovations are finished the pictures will also be much better. "
Amazing Views!,A visit to this temple is a must. Beautiful statutes and unsurpassed views. The temple is easily accessed by public buses.
Breathtaking ,"This is definitely a must visit in Busan. It is a temple on a cliff by the sea. Take the subway to Haeundae Station (Line 2 #203) take exit 7 and walk straight towards the bus stop. Take bus 181, it's 1200 won (T-card) or 1300 won if you pay in cash. The journey is about 30 mins. There's a lot of passengers alighting at this stop so you won't go wrong. There's also a signage at the bus stop. Walk against the traffic flow and turn left at the nearest bend and take a 10-min stroll up. Enter the temple door and you will be welcomed by the statues of the 12 zodiac. Take the stairs and walk down, along the way don't forget to take the left path where you will be greeted by the scenic view of the temple on the cliff. It's a relatively small temple with a few key sights. When walking out of the temple, you can take the steps up to carpark 3, turn immediately into the small beaten path on the left, follow the path and down to a narrow path along the cliff and you will be greeted by yet another amazing sight, but do take extra care as the path is not barricaded. There are very few tourists who will walk into this path. We were lucky to be adventurous and saw a few people walking out from the path. However, not advisable to go this path if you have kids with you, as mentioned it is not barricade n very steep and narrow. Realised most post does not mention about getting back to Haeundae. Well, it's quite simple, take the same way back, cross the road and walk to the nearest bus stop, take bus 181 and drop off at Haeundae Station. There will be announcement in English plus signage on the bus stop."
"Beautiful location for a temple, on the sea!","We were crazy and walked several km to this temple, just for fun (a challenge), but I recommend taking a taxi (it is far from the last subway stop, and is also up a steep hill). It is located right on the sea, so it is quite picturesque. I think it is definitely worth a visit and make for some nice pictures. They are currently doing some construction work on the grounds, but it doesn't interfere with most angles from which you can take nice pictures. If in Busan I think this is one of the places one should see. We walked along Moonton Road on the way (so far of a walk that most people could not handle that, so just take a taxi to save your legs and time), which took us through a little forested area along the sea, which was charming. Make sure to tell your taxi to wait for you at the temple, so you can have a guaranteed ride back to the subway station, or I am not sure what you would be able to do to get back to where you need to go. Taxis are very reasonably priced ($5-$10 USA back to the subway). Temple is free. "
Crowded on weekend,"Just a common temple, maybe what makes it special is it's near the sea with beautiful rocks. I took bus 181 and very crowded, maybe it was saturday and the bus came every 30 min. I was standing on the bus and the driver was sucks, got me dizzy and nauseous. From the bus stop, you have to walk quite far to get to the temple."
Nice view.,"Nice view from the temple. Don't forget to try 씨앗호떡 (Seeds pankake,sort of) near the parking lot.We had a pleasant walk from the bus stop, which took about 20 minutes."
Temple out of city center,"Temple out of city center. Get to Haeundae Beach station #203, get out from exit 7, take bus #181 and get off at Yonggungsa Temple. When u hop on the bus, just inform the bus driver that you're heading to the temple and they are helpful enough to tell you where to get down. After get down from bus, it takes about 10 mins walk up the hill to reach to the temple. Nice view, great temple and worth a visit. "
Picturesque,We went during after Budha's Birthday and the temple was lined with lanterns and it looked so beautiful. Beautiful view and easy walk around the temple although there are some steps.
Nothing special,Is easy to get here from Haeundae Station.But its only take 30mins to visit all the places.Too bad is under renovation upon my visit. 
Seaside Temple,"Take a bus 181 from Haeundae station. The journey's around 25 minutes from Haeundae station. Frankly, Its a temple by the sea, the sea view is magnificient, but the temple is not. Maybe because some part of the temple is under construction now. Construction materials everywhere. There are stalls selling food and some souvenirs before reaching the temple. Since the its a bit far from city center, advice to visit if there are extra time during your stay."
Beautiful Sea View,"I guess it is best to reach here early in the morning to enjoy the sea breeze and witness the sunrise? We arrived around noon and it was quite hot, but the beautiful scenery blow our minds off. We are on a budget trip, but coming here with all the walks and bus trip worth every single won of it. The temple was not as huge as I thought it should be, but the historical stories and the greenery surrounded by the peaceful ambience, it worths."
Beautiful Temple by the Coast!,My second time here. Worth a visit for sure if you are in Busan. Take the tourist bus if not keen to explore on your own. A good 10-15 min walk in from the bus stop. Very picturesque and absolutely stunning. The sound of waves crashing onto the temple's cliff has a calming effect indeed. 
Temple By The Sea,"We took a cab here...about $9.00US from the Paradise Hotel & Casino. At the entrance area, there are several old kiosks selling the same things...cheap souvenirs, food, candy, etc. A man with only one leg, who sat on the ground, was feeding cats and wanted a handout.The zodiac statues are there and are very nice. Count on many stone stairs, up and down and some uneven paths. They were doing construction on the main bridge and that took away from the overall experience. Many Buddha, set around diff. areas...ocean, building, Cliffside, etc. A monk was beating drum and another was chanting for the hour or so we were there...on a loud speaker. Lovely.I would recommend an hour here...the shops and rests. are really garbage. We enjoyed the Temple very much, mostly because of the sea location."
Not worth going if you have limited time,"Nothing special much about this place, especially when it's super crowded. It will take you a lot of time going to this place. Therefore, if you don't have much time, this one is definitely a skipper"
해동용궁사,"This temple is a strange one comparing to the traditional temples such as Bumeusa and Tongdosa. It is located in the beautiful place with great ocean view, however the atmosphere in the temple is more likely asking money from tourists. There arre many spots with money collection box in everywhere. I would like not to recommend this place as a sightseeing place for foreigners. I would like to recommend more traditional temples like Bumeusa and Tongdosa where you can fell the solemnity of the buddism."
Wasn't worth the effort,After a long bus ride. I found it not worth the while and it was one of the places I was most excited to visit in Korea. It was too commercial touristy feeling. There was construction that was obtrusive. I understand it but it totally took away from the feeling. Plus there was garbage everywhere but that's everywhere. I just thought people would have more respect. It had great views but for me it totally wasn't worth the visit. A big golden Buddah wasn't very old either. May be I was expecting more. Like hundred old buddah statues that is loved and respected rather than just a big buddah that feels like was put there for tourist reasons.
Disappointing,"I know other people were stunned by this temple, but I was underwhelmed. Partly, it could be because the main bridge was under renovation. It was very crowded. The advertising signs strung across the main building detracted from the serenity of the place. The temple does seem to tick all the boxes on prayers--for sons, good grades, zodiac signs, health, wishes, etc. "
A very different temple,"Apparently the only Buddhist temple in Korea that is located right next to the sea, it certainly has a different ""feel"". All the standard sanctuaries, statues and carvings are there, however they are good rather than spectacular. It is the backdrop of the sea that makes it special. Some construction on the go, presumably to improve access to the areas closer to the water- If you are into photography try to get it in the early morning or late afternoon, otherwise the sun makes a good panorama shot difficult. - Early is also best for avoiding crowds.- I suggest using a taxi, while the train is possible, the station is beyond comfortable walking distance- Toilets at the temple are grubby and smelly, those in the carpark are a lot better"
Beautiful Views,"This temple is not only gorgeous for its vibrant colors, statues, and shrines, but the cliff-side views of the sea. Standing on the bridges and overlooks to gaze out at the water is a highlight of any trip to beautiful Busan."
Just average,"Going in, I had high expectations as the number one thing to do on tripadvisor. I took the 181 bus by exit 7 of Haeundae metro station. Ride took about 25 minutes and cost 1300 Won. I was told taxis cost about 10000 Won. The description on tripadvisor says this temple was built in the 1300s but it was actually burned down in the 1500s by the Japanese and rebuilt in the 1900s. It's still pretty, but not exactly ancient. There are good views, but not great. The temple itself is really small - many of the popular temples I've seen in Asia are larger and much older so I was pretty disappointed. I would still recommend going if you're visiting Busan, but I wouldn't expect too much. "
HaedongYonggung Temple,This temple is one of a few temples located at the seaside in Korea. There is a great Buddah statue and a wish well.
Beautiful but busy,"We were there today which is Sunday. It was very busy in the morning it was just getting hot out. There are plenty of places to buy trinkets. We had a great time my daughter loved that she got to climb on rocks. They had some stray cats out, one of the workers stopped her from going near them so I'm not sure if it was because he was worried about the cats or her. It was peaceful in some places. It is a climb and the trails are not level, and in some places you will need to remove your shoes to enter. The bathrooms at the temple were very smelly from the outside we did not go into them. They had some bronze plates you could buy and write a prayer on it. They have a place to throw coins into some bowls. It was very beautiful being right next to the water. "
One of the most magical places I've seen,This is probably my favourite place in all of South Korea. I spent 15 months in S.K. and saw a lot of the country and this was always my favourite place. I returned to it as often as I could. It's definitely a must see. I recommend going when the temple is active and they are practicing meditation. I hope to go back here someday. It's best to just take a taxi out to see the temple as it is very hard to get to otherwise.
Good Fengshui with zen.,"A temple by the cliff, where the land meets the sea while your soul gets empowered by the raging sea waves and strong gust of wind. There is a big guan yin statue on top of the temple and there are a lot of sculptures ranging from big to small, from animals like monkey to legendary beasts like dragons. There's a place where you can try your luck with coin tossing into a unique waterfall with 3 layers with a small bowl at each layer. Prior to reaching this temple, you'll pass through some sculptures gardens. At the entrance, there are a lot of hawkers selling delicious Korean snacks. Definitely worth your visit."
quite a journey as well as a destination....,Spectacular setting.....location...location....location....try not to visit on weekends or holidays for the unpleasant crowds spoiling the experience....you are in for a treat if you enjoy nature and prime real estate..... staked by religion.....
Beautiful location for a temple! Definitely don't skip it,"A beautiful location for a temple, right along the coast definitely one of the most beautiful places in Busan. Dedicate around 1-2 hours for this attraction. "
Haedong Yonggung Sa,"This temple was built after a monk had a vision, a god who came in the form of a dragon with a serpent head, instructing him to build it.It sits on the side of a mountain by the sea. The strong waves crashes onto the rocks just below it - Wild and beautiful.A stair built with rocks link the upper and lower levels. Its calm on the top level with trees backing the temple and the seaview in front. Perfect setting for reflection.Walk around the outer garden with Buddhist sutra carved onto stone blocks teaching one that the past, the present and the future are linked. The principle of yin and yang energy, cause and effect. Another way of expressing it: 'you reap what you sow'."
Must see temple on the ocean,"This temple is very different than other temples around Korea. It is right on the ocean and the views are breathtaking. Take bus 181 from Haeundae Station to the temple (It is the only stop announced in english). The temple is a short 15 minute walk from here. I would go early in the morning to beat the crowd, as I have seen many pictures with large crowds around this temple. We came around 7 am on a Tuesday and were able to catch a bit of the sunrise. There were only a handful of people here at this time and it made the visit much better. The only problem I have with this area is the shop and restaurant inside the temple area."
Stunning!,"I read about this temple before our trip and didn't know if we'd be able to get there. But we found ourselves in the vicinity, decided to grab a cab for the short ride and were so happy we did because it was AMAZING-best temple we visited during our trip. A must see. And be sure to stop for a fresh hotteok or ssiat hotteok – fried pancake with brown sugar and cinnamon filling, from a vendor on the way out!"
"Korean Heritage, very calm place","Easy to get there by bus. Really calm be there, enjoyed the view while listening the chant music. Don't miss it if visit Busan."
Temple by the Beach - Must See,OMG - This temple by the beach is beautiful. Definitely worth the stop. There are so many things to say about this temple - weather was beautiful for the viewing although it was windy. Maybe pictures will do it justice.
Amusing~,This Temple is located very close to city center a d very easy to reach. The temple itself is very amusing. It is very worthy to spent time in this friendly area and find some peace in mind. 
A must to visit!,"Lots of climbing, not suitable for elders and young children. Love the scenery and the temples. Very windy, be careful of your caps etc."
The best! ,This is my favorite temple is Busan! It's easy to get to and breath taking! Haeundae station exit 7. Take bus 181 to the temple stop. It announces the name in English and is one stop after the huge Lotte mall on your left. Go!!! 
Must See/Must Do.....And wear your walking shoes,"What an experience....and so beautiful. The temple and its grounds will take your breath away, and to imagine is was built in 1376. One thing I did was to imagine this area without the development and take in its beauty.Again, bring your walking shoes. There a quite a number of stairs."
Absolutely Breathtaking!,One of the most serene and picturesque temples in Busan. This is definitely a must visit when you are in the area. The wind from the sea is just so refreshing you will forget the tiredness from the long stair climb. 
"Unique, nice scenery, a cultural ground","Just a short review here,Well ( yong-gung-sa ) korean pronounciation.Is a hybrid Taoism and Buddhism temple that is located facing the east as haedong means east sea and yong-gung means dragon palace. My wife and I took train to jangsan station before we took a cab that cause us 5000 won to reach. ( you will go pass lotte mall which is premium outlet )The scenery is breath taking if its no raining and the statues are definitely worth your time to have abit of walk around the temple, outside the temple are local foods and cafes where you can enjoy the sea with. Basically when i went it was raining this too bad, if not i might give it a 5 star :) Enjoy"
Worth the visit if you're in Busan!,"Even with crowds, this mostly outdoor old temple with recreations of ancient statues is still serene with its coastal location. You will probably find a monk performing a ceremony. The swastika symbol you will see is an ancient symbol of good fortune. Some of the uneven steps and amount of climbing may make it difficult for someone with mobility issues.If you want a souvenir, or street food you will find many vendors lined up outside of the temple. I recommend hotteok sweet dumplings. Delicious!"
Temple on the ocean,"Interesting with great architecture, a 2 hour walk thru, was hoping for more.I would recommend getting there early, we left by 12:30 and it was starting to get very crowded"
This is a must see,"part of the city bus tour you have to visist this place just a beautiful location,easy access,lovely entertaining short walk to get there"
City close temple,This temple is a must when you are in Busan. Its located roughly 20 min by Taxi from Huendae neighbourhood. 
Beautiful temple by the sea,"It was the most beautiful temple I have visited so far. The view was awesome! We took many beautiful photos there. Be prepared to walk quite a bit, some of the walkway are steep & narrow with edgy stone sides. My niece slipped & fell when we were walking back, her knee was badly scrapped by the sharp stones. But we still enjoyed our visit there. Beware of dog poop especially when walking to the temple."
Pretty temple by the sea,"Haedong Yonggung Temple is one of the few Buddhist temple in Busan that is located right next to the sea. Its picturesque view is definitely worth the hike up the hill. By the time we reached the temple I was already huffing and puffing. Since it was winter, the bitter chill that engulfed us despite my thick winter jacket did little to encourage my enthusiasm. There were lots of stalls lining up the climb upwards selling all sort of knick-knacks. "
Beautiful Sunrise ^^,"I have been to this temple many times and it’s no doubt one of the best temples in the south. It has the best sunrise view. Very Instagram worthy place. Before reaching the temple, you will be greeted by vendors. As usual, korean street foods, clothing pieces and of course anything related to Buddha. Just be prepared for a long walk or trek even high steps because it is situated in hillside and careful because it’s rocky.My favorite photo was of course the temple and the big golden Buddha.Very nice experience indeed."
Very beautiful seaside temple ,The location of the temple was great that it's just at the seaside! You can see the waves splashing through the rock and shower back all over.... The whole tour was about 30mins. Holy place but too touristic that it becomes not so holy anymore. 
Beautiful ,Beautiful and worth the way! A bit complicated to get there for a tourist (need to take the bus and no one know english - all written in korean). 
Best temple you'll see in Korea. Period.,"When anyone asks me what they need to see while in Busan I always direct them to the seaside temple. Every time I go it's a new, peaceful adventure. While it can be quite busy at times it's one of the few times when you're surrounded by strangers that you will not feel suffocated. It is relaxing and welcoming to everyone. You're on the water taking in the view while in an atmosphere that breeds tranquility. Just the best place to be on a sunny day!"
nice temple by the sea,"there is still around 15minutes walking from the bus stop to the temple. view quite nice but the sea is a bit dirty. before u reach the temple , there is many shop and food hawker there, quite nice after u walk for so long time."
Seaside Temple,"This seaside Temple had a bit of everything with an active Temple, some vendors selling goods, pretty views, Buddhist statues, some shrines, and various walking paths."
Temple beside beach,I go there by bus. Need to walk around 10min to reach the destination. View not bad. It beside the beach. You may spend one hour here will do. The air very good. Location a bit outskirts. From town to here will take around one hour by bus. From here you can take taxi to lotte outlet. The fare around won3000. 
Daunting,"A beautiful temple at the edge of the sea. It is a visit worthwhile, just be prepaired for a lot of people since it's popular."
Lots of photo opportunities for tourists,"Verdict: - Great for tourists wanting photo opportunitiesRecommendations:- Go on a week day when it is less crowded- Preferably go on cool day; quite a bit of walk and stairs- Wear enclosed shoes; rocky surfaces- Try local food (red bean paste tarts, fish cakes etc.) at ""food alley"" along the way to templeHow to get there by public transport:- Take train to Jangsang (last station on Line 2)- Take Bus 7 (the bus stop across the road)- Get off 1 stop AFTER Lotte Mall.- Follow signs; about 15-20 minute walkObservations:- Statues along the way and outside the main temple look new or newly restored- Heaps of statues = Heaps of photo opportunities- I personally didn't see/feel the historical aspects despite it being built in 1300s. A bit too touristy for my liking."
Absolutely worth visiting,Absolutely worth visiting. A must-go sightseeing tourist spot. Wonderful scenery with great traditional heritage.
Look ancient but not very old,It's a long walk from the bus stop to the temple. Actually it's quite small area. Interesting if you are a pious Buddhist. 
Breadthtaking Temple!,"Beautiful Temple, with amazing views. There are quite a few stairs involved so you will be doing a lot of climbing but it's well worth it as the place is breadthtaking."
Not to be missed,"I loved this. there was so much to see, and very interesting to get an insight into peoples religious traditions in korea. Whats more interesting is that it has an unique location, which makes the visit very worthwhile. It stunned me, the duality of the beautiful scenery together with the peaceful temple. personally i think itssuitable for people of all ages."
"Interesting but this will not be a subliminal, mystical, or spiritual experience...","...at least no more than the opportunity you would get in other places (actually, the UN Peace Park would be more inviting for that purpose). Haedong Yonggung Temple is a short trip from Busan, get there early before the crowds start arriving (you may want to be on your way out by 10:00AM). When I arrived there were only a handful of tourists; had the chance of sitting down and listening to a monk chanting for a little while. I also got to take some pics without obstruction by tourists taking selfies. It was a nice visit and I would recommend it if one has a free morning; however, it is not ""exceptional"".It can be reached by public transportation. Some tips: Ride Bus 100 or Bus 181 from BEXCO (bus stop is sort of behind BEXCO right next to the exits from Busan Art Museum Metro station, all bus stops are well marked with the buses that stop there) or Haeundae Metro Station. Pay exact fare (1200 won) by depositing in glass box (bills are ok). The trip is bout 25 mins from BEXCO and 20 from Haeundae (bus website may show shorter ride times). All signs are in Korean. From BEXCO: about 20 minutes into the ride, the bus makes a left turn and you will first see the ocean on the right. Soon after, you will see a big building on the left with a huge sign LOTTE MALL. You want to get off at the stop across this mall. Most probably the bus will stop anyways (people/workers going to the mall) to make sure it does press the stop button. Bus 181 stops across the street from the mall. There is a big, read question mark behind the bus stop (a sculpture?); bus drops you off and then continues straight on the same road. You want to walk up the road (sort of following the bus) and about 1/4 of a mile (400 meters) you will see a sign with a red ""svastika"" (this is NOT the nazi symbol) showing you to go right towards the temple. It may be another 400-500 meters to the temple entrance. Bus 100 makes a sharp left turn at the light before stopping. If you are riding Bus 100, just walk back to the road you were coming from, make a left, walk up the 400 meters to the sign, etc.Heading back, walk to the intersection (where the sign with the red svastika is), cross the street and there is a bus stop (Bus 181). It will take you back to BEXCO or Haeundae.You can walk back to LOTTE Mall if you want to wait at a bus stops where both Bus 181 and Bus 100 stop.There is a good number of food vendors at the entrance of the temple. Goodies look good; however, all signs are in Korean only. If you have dietary restrictions, it may be safer not to try anything. A number of souvenirs stores/locales available here, too. Entrance to temple is free. Restrooms available at parking lot before entering the temple. All the other things worth mentioning have been described by other reviewers.Enjoy the hike!"
Serene and Magical,This was a beautiful temple right on the ocean in South Korea. A very serene and magical place. I truly enjoyed my visit to this sacred place. Definitely worth your time to visit.
Beautiful,My understanding is this is the only Temple on the sea as most are more secluded in the mountains so this one is scenic and special. 
Lots of walking amazing views ancient temples,Very nice easy walk around the temples its at a amazing location and great old things to see lots of adumas everywhere too Great way to spend 4 or 5 hours a must if your in busan 
Only Buddhist temple by the sea.,Buddhist temples are traditionally at mountain tops but this one is perched on a rocky shore which you recah by going down lots of stairs rather than up. It is really impressive and the specatcular location is part of the reason.
Highlight of our trip to Busan,"This gorgeous temple was balanced on craggy rocks next to the ocean, and it was interesting to walk around and see the temple from so many different angles. Make sure you take a left as you are about halfway down the steps to the temple, as it leads to an area by the beach where you can look back at the temple and get some great pictures.There are precisely 108 steps leading down to the temple, and our guide said this was to symbolize the 108 ""agonies"" that people have to face in their normal lives. Our guide said she had 2 children, so she had 308 agonies to bear... 100 for each child. :) She was kidding, and it sounded like she really loved her children, but having a Buddhist guide along enhanced the experience for all the flavor she gave it.There was a Buddha there that supposedly increased your chances of having a boy if you rubbed it's tummy and touched it's nose. My wife, who is very done having children, stayed at least 10 feet away from it.One thing: we went in late July which, for temperature and humidity reasons, was an incredibly bad time to go. Talk about hot and sweaty. I would have loved to go in January, but alas, my daughter's school dictates when our vacations are..."
No Monk Sightings,"The temple is absolutely breathtaking. It's built into the rocks above the sea and there's even a walkway where you can grab a picture of the whole temple along with the ocean underneath it. It's incredibly crowded so I suggest going a bit earlier in the morning. And by a bit earlier I mean 8 AM. Walking around the temple with that many people isn't a big deal but trying to get the bus back to the city is like Battle Royale when everyone is trying to leave at the same time. There's great food and little souvenirs and these wonderful statues that are a tribute to the Chinese zodiac. From the bus stop, it's a bit of a walk up but it's maybe only a 10 minute walk and it's not very steep. I know you can reserve a temple stay here and I've heard very good things about it if you'd like to experience a bit of the monk lifestyle. However, if you're just thing to visit the tourist area of the temple, it'll not only be loud but there won't be a monk in sight. "
my 3rd day in korea,"very nice place to visit . visited this place on my 3rd day. the place is amazing,, beautiful view,, ocean on your side,, loved it"
Cool temple but gets crowded quick!,Very picturesque! Easy to get to and cabs a plenty for getting back to Busan. It gets packed though so I'd recommend going early! Bring water with you since there are a bunch of stairs and the summer heat / humidity is a killer
Seaside Temple visit,"Awesome visit and my second time to this picturesque temple. Easy drive and nestled in the hillside right on the sea. Take your time to explore and enjoy the grounds. Great photos and serene, albeit this site does get busy with tourists. Go early!Check out the kiosks lining the walk way on your way back to the parking lot. "
Temple by the Sea,"A beautiful small temple near the sea. The rock formation near the sea is also breathtaking; can take photo with such an astounding view. Go there using bus 181,7 or 100, might take awhile as it is located far from the city. "
Beautiful view!,It is one of the most unique temples in Korea. It located right on the beach. There are many steps but not too difficult compare to other temples in Korea. Must see in Busan. 
Buddhist temple with dramatic seaside location in Busan,"Haedong Yonggung Sa ('East Sea Dragon Palace Temple') is one of the most famous temples in Korea; the current temple complex is also a reconstruction from the 1930s of the original 14th c. temple. While the temple buildings are interesting and impressive, it's really the dramatic location of the temple complex on the seaside that makes this temple unusual and worth seeing. But beware: it's a long trip there and a potentially exhausting trip around the temple grounds. First you have to take the Busan subway to the end of the line; then you have to hail a taxicab for a 20-minute taxi ride out of the city to the temple; then you have to walk what feels like miles up and downhill to get to the temple complex itself, and you have to have the agility of a mountain goat to scale some of the more treacherous passages, so wear solid shoes. This site is the opposite of anything you could ever conceive of as 'wheelchair accessible'~! You probably don't want to go on a rainy day, as it could be dreary and the many stone steps could be very slippery. Is it worth it? I think that depends on how 'into' Buddhist temples you are. But if you're a Buddhist or just interested in Buddhism or Korean history, it may well be. I found it charming and really worth an hour there plus an hour in transit getting there and back into Busan. The final climb is up to a big stone statue of Gwan Yin, the boddhisattva of compassion, from which there's a nice view of the entire temple complex. There's also a really cute photo opportunity posing with two big gilded pigs (representing good luck and prosperity) on the site. If you're preparing for an exam or applying to a school, you can leave an offering of some sort such as a coin at the altar to academic achievement. And you can try your luck with the lucky coin toss in the fountain, which is probably an extreme long shot at best.And there's a whole gauntlet of souvenir and food vendors between the entrance to the site and the temple complex itself. I should also mention that the public restrooms stink to high heaven, so you probably won't want to spend a great deal of time in them. And be prepared to see a number of swastikas, the sight of which sometimes shocks Americans and Europeans unfamiliar with the ancient Hindu and Buddhist origin of the symbol before its appropriation and perversion by Hitler and the Nazis. When you leave the site, you have to be prepared to wait for a taxi bringing arriving tourists to the temple complex. Fortunately, we only had to wait a few minutes for one, but I can imagine it could be competitive on a busy day. The fare itself should be somewhere between $10-20 to take you to the end of the subway line. And if you're so inclined, you can combine this with a visit to Haeundae Beach, which you can easily reach by subway."
A temple with a view,"This is one of the temples that i have been to with the nicest views in the whole of Korea. Its a peaceful place with speakers playing some chanting which makes the experience all the more better! There is a small street before the entrance of the temple which sells local delicacies. Oh, the toilet inside the temple is really under maintained (had to hold my breath the entire time and there were 5-10 houseflies at a time when you are in a cubicle) so please do your business at the toilet at the car park.You can get there by taxi or bus, though i recommend bus. Get off at Haeundae Station (Busan Subway Line 2), Exit 7 then take Bus 181 and get off at Yonggungsa Temple. Many locals will also be heading there so you can just alight with them. There is also a Lotte mall nearby, just one stop before the temple so you can use it as your cue to get off at the next stop. If i am not wrong the ride is about 30 minutes."
Amazing temple ,"Twenty mins drive out of town is this amazing temple. It's on the coast and the sea adds to the scene. It's not too strenuous to climb to the top, less than 70 steps. It can get slippery, so wear sturdy footwear. There's a car park near by 2,000won and taxis also are parked outside. "
Simply Awesome,"One thing we were would like to say is Korean people are very tourist friendly. We went to this temple taking the train then by bus and then walk. It was raining and the wind was strong in November. All along the journey, Korean came out from nowhere to direct us to this awesome place. Upon reaching the temple, the sight of the temple with the sea is truly Heaven on earth. It is a must visit place in Busan."
Many people on Sunday,Try to avoid the weekend. I've been there on a sunday and it was pretty crauded.Still a nice Temple with its special location on the rocks at the coast.Easy reachable by bus and a short walk from Busan.
Really nice temple next to the sea,I would recomend this temple even after seing so many. It's on the ocean where huge waves break on the shore and create that magical fealing. To acces go to haundae station to exit 7 and take the bus 181 for 20 mins it cost 1300 w for the bus 
Beautiful seaside temple,"Seaside temple with history, is the best place to explore and enjoy. For a Buddhism like me, may very impressed with the structure of the temple. The classic looking. Is a place must go if you are in BUSAN. May take bus to reach but need walk up hill before reaching the temple if you wouldn't wanna waste of taking a cab, or you are not following a tour guides bus."
 The temple by the sea,The temple itself is nothing distuingishable than the rest of temples in Korea. The location is quite nice. The tunnled rock pathway to the temple is also unique.
One of the most unique temples in Korea!,If you're in Busan it's a must visit! Be aware that there are lots of stairs though. And it's almost always incredibly busy (especially on weekends and beautiful days). 
"Picturesque Seaside Temple, Worth a Visit If You Have the Time","To me, all temples look somewhat…the same…but this seaside location makes this one unique and worth a visit if you have the time, perhaps a “day three” activity if staying for a few days in Busan. It is a little remote and while some reviews say you can take the bus there, you should definitely take a taxi as that will save you lots of time and make things a lot easier. Be warned there are a lot of stairs, so probably not so great for elderly people with joint pain (I took my mom who has knee problems, it was difficult for her, but she got by, just very very slowly…). The temple itself is pretty small, only a few buildings so you probably only need an hour or so to explore, but the views are very pretty and provide many picture taking opportunities."
Stunning,Possibly one of the best location for a temple.. enlightenment guaranteed.. a must visit place in Busan.. 
To do in Busan,Small complex but views are breathtaking! Only about 10-15 min taxi ride from Haeundae beach. And a great place to take photos!
Temple along the coast,"Located about 45 minutes out of Busan. The temple is very nice but it does have a great number of steps. If you are mobility limited, I would suggest you skip this site. The temple itself is beautiful with quite a bit of detailes artwork. It sits right on the coast and there are multiple locations for some great pictures."
Beautiful temple. Great place for photography,One of the nicest temples I'd visited in South Korea. Highly recommend if you visit Busan. Free entry but do take note of opening hours. Expect plenty of steps and stairs. Temple is built right at the edge of cliff. 
Favorite temple in korea ,"This temple is beautiful! I have been to many temples in korea and this is my favorite so far, I love the location on the coast. It is amazing! Highly recommend going here while in busan"
BEAUTIFUL TEMPLE BY THE SEA,"Beautiful temple. i was visiting the temple during the cherry blossom and the start of the buddha month.Beautiful flowers and a few lantern was placed up at the temple.i was a cold day with strong vind, but I had a nice time at the temple.A good tips is to take a taxi out and ask the taxi driver to take the coastroad from Hundae beach to the temple during the cherry blossom, and for not last, ask the driver to waith for you, and pay him exstra for that.it is a long stol to go to the bus stop and even longer to go to the outlet shoppingsenter for getting a taxi."
YONGGUNGSA TEMPLE,"This was a nice temple to see. I went during Buddah's birthday so it was very busy with people and was very crowded. There was a little fountain thing with people lined up to drink it. I guess the water held some significance, so if your into those types of things, bring a water bottle and fill it up there, as that's what other people were doing."
Nice place to visit,"Lovely location perched on the edge of a cliff, lots of photo opportunities.Geared up for the tourist though, lots of stalls selling plastic mementos"
must see,such great history of the south of Korea the colors are beautiful and the workmanship is super the history for being hundred of years old is well worth the trip and time to see I was there on my 7yr tour of Korea 1975-1981
Very nice,Lovely temple by the sea (and great sweet stuffed pancake snacks grilled by vendors at the entrance!) 
Beautiful temple!,"It was very windy due to raining day.However, it was good choice to visit the place due to their spectacular view. Didn't expect that much, but it was very lovely place."
A Unique Temple Experience: The Smell of Salt and the Sound of Waves,"This temple is very unique in that it sits right off the coast. You can also buy some good Korean street food, such as hotteok, beondegi, or sausage on a stick during the walk up to the temple at a fair price. The temple is fairly large and offers a few picturesque views. Definitely go and enjoy the peaceful atmosphere of the temple and the sound and smell of the ocean nearby.Getting there: Take Bus 181 or 7 from Haeundae Station at the bus terminal out of exit 7. It’ll be a little bit of a ride, so try and find a seat if you can and get off at Yonggungsa Temple (용궁사). Buddha’s Birthday: The best time of year to visit this temple is around the Buddha’s birthday. The lantern decorations are definitely a sight to see. If you go on the actual day of the Buddha’s birthday, you can catch a free a lunch. This year they were supposed to give out the free lunch until 1:30 PM; however, the line was still long and there was still plenty of food left to give at that time. So, monks and volunteers alike continued giving food away until they ran out at around 4. I know this because I received the second to last rice and kimchi bowl and bowl of seaweed soup. Score!"
Must do!,Very nice - I sent all of my guests here when I lived in Busan! Definitely a unique temple experience - try to go on a weekday as it gets shoulder to shoulder busy on weekends. Beautiful view and setting for a temple.
Haedong Yonggung,An excellent trip! The temple is built into an alcove on a cliff face. It contains lots of little elephant statues and a couple of Buddhas. Would recommend heading down to the rocks on the beach front in order to get the best view of the whole temple. This is the first thing you should do when in Busan!
Beautiful ocean side Temple,"If you go to 1 temple in Korea, this is the place. You can catch a bus here. There are a long corridor of vendors between the parking lot and the entrance. You'll see a bunch of zodiac statues. It's a long walk down many steps to get to the main temple. Keep this in mind as you'll be going back up to leave. Along the way there are statues and shrines. Make sure to rub the Buddha's belly if you want a baby boy. There are also a couple of smaller temple areas on the left side as you go down which are worth checking out. On the left before the bridge to the main area you can see the big golden buddha on the sea wall. The main area is very pretty and the view from the upper section is really beautiful. Avoid coming here on weekend. It gets packed with tourists.Avoid bringing kids if you can. As with many Korean temples and attractions, It's not the safest place for kids.Make sure to bring snacks and a drink.Make sure to use a restroom prior to heading down to the temple."
Yes! Go.,"Everything you read here is true. This temple is next to the sea. For me this was completely new... I traveled before to many many temples in Asia, but none as this. Maybe is not the largest one, or with a remarkable architecture one, but the feeling of the seaside is unique. I even took some time to meditate, was quite satisfactory. I still don't understand why some said that they ""waste"" half day to go here. If I return to Busan, I would like to return without hesitate. Not difficult to get there if you stay in Haeundae via bus. When you are done, visit Lottle Outlet Mall, you wont regret it."
Beautiful seaside temple,"This temple is easy to access and the views will not disappoint. Built right on the ocean, every direction you turn is photo-worthy. Go to Haeundae subway station, exit 7, and take Bus 181 to the Haedong Yonggungsa Temple stop and walk less than a mile (follow the signs) until you get to the temple."
A temple by the sea coast,"We took a bus to this temple which was quite convenient as we alight at the bus and walked about 15 minutes to the temple area. Quite an interesting place with the cool weather although there is no particular interesting architectural features.From this temple, we walked about 20 minutes to the Lotte Outlet Mall which was newly opened in Dec 2014. "
This visit is a must,Don’t miss it !!! This visit is at a easy reach form the center and it is definitely worth trip. Nice Buddhist Temple.
Not for the Faint Hearted!,"This temple lies on the coast to the east of Busan.Access to the various levels is from above via numerous quite steep steps with only limited refuge points en route to catch your breath. It is not such a problem going down but is certainly more of a challenge going up! Those with respiratory issues should be careful, especially with the often humid atmosphere. The coastal location provides some interesting perspectives of the temple. Of the two temples visited during my stay this one appeared the most commercial with sales outlets within the temple complex itself as well as the approaching access route.The temple has a number of interesting artefacts, buildings and icons but generally appeared a bit shabby.Nonetheless, it is well worth a visit if the access challenge doesn't put you off."
A must to see temple at sea side,"I visited this temple 3rd time and for sure not last time.For me, this is one of the most Beauty temple directly at sea side.A must to visit."
An average Buddhist Temple,"Well, maybe I'm a little jaded, but once you've seen one temple, they start to get old after a while. It was a nice activity for the morning, so no regrets, but I guess I expected more. The view of the shoreline was a bit disappointing with all the construction happening everywhere. The temples themselves were underwhelming compared to some I've see in Thailand and China. That said, I would still have gone - it was a decent outing."
Amazing view of mountain and ocean,"We took the bus there so we need to walk quite a bit before arriving at the temple. There's also a few stairs to climb and descend upon reaching. The view was totally worth the effort, it was one of the highlights of my trip. "
So many temples in one place,"We decided to visit the Haedong Yonggung Temple and were pleased we did. To access the temple area you need to climb down 108 steps (but who's counting) as they wind down along the volcanic coastline. There are lots of things to stop and look at along the way so you can have a rest if needed, especially on the way but up. The main temple is colourful and beautiful and there are many smaller temples and shrines as well on every rocky outcrop and in every nook and cranny. It was a pretty place and worth a look. So too were the food markets leading into the temple grounds.Toilets: There is a western stype toilet in the carpark before you enter the marketplace. The toilet in the temple area itself is a squat pit (no flush) one. Be prepared for the smell and take toilet paper."
Pro Tip,"As everyone will tell you the temple is quite beautiful and I certainly recommend going in the spring or fall when the temperatures are moderate. Go fairly early in the day as you will want to still have time for the tip I am about to give you.As you walk up the path leaving the temple where you must pass the animals there is a road that goes behind the temple. This road has a gate which blocks your path of travel however if you follow a trail that leads to parking there is a left turn that can be made which bypasses this gate. Take this and walk up the road to the back side of the temple. As you crest the hill there will be a cliff to your left. There is a trail that leads down to the boulders that jut out to the right of the temple overlooking the ocean. This is a wonderful location to hang out, have a picnic if that is what you are into or just relax and watch the sun set. Yes it is out of the way but so is the whole temple so why not make a day of it and see an area that most people don't get to see. Oh and by the way the path I told you about has a marker for most beautiful views in Korea."
Not really worth the travelling time,"It's not very near.. we travelled for nearly an hour to reach there by bus.Hmmm.. i think it's nice to walk around the Haedong Yonggungsa Temple but i doubt i will go back there again.If you are someone who like to visit temples when you travel, i think this place might be your cup of tea. Especially when the view is quite nice lolWe didn't stay there for too long so not really worth the travelling time in my opinion.Full review: http://wanderer.summeree.com/travel/korea/busan/haedong-yonggungsa-temple/"
Excellent Temple complex,"Visited Haedong Yonggung Temple in April. Grabbed a taxi from Haeundae Station to the entrance. While there were lots of people moving through the normal souvenir stalls towards the Temple, it didn't seem overly crowded. Statues of the Chinese Years (Rat, Rabbit, Dragon etc.) lined the avenue and there were various shrines to other 'professions' along the way including one in the form of a car tyre (apparently to help those Koreans that don’t want to get into a car accident ?). Steps down and around to Temple rewards one with a great ocean view and of the Temple complex and other statues. You could do a lot worse than spend an hour or so exploring the area."
Temple Visit,Loved visiting Haedong Temple. Visited it on the 24th of May which fell during a Buddhist festival. Such a breathtakingly beautiful temple! 
Nice temple next to the sea,Visited the temple on Wesak Day in May. Full of people locals and tourists made walking difficult. Street vendors food and sovenirs lined at the entrance. A good place and scenery to take photos. Entrance is free. From Haeundae metro station take 181 bus (1050 won) to the temple bus stop and walk about 10 minutes. Nearby is a NEW shopping mall call Lotte Dong Busan with a factory outlet too.
Nice Temple in Korea,"The temple was positioned right on the ocean which was extremely nice to see. Yet, as for any other temples in Korea, the location was overwhelmed with people and tourists. It wasn't difficult getting here, yet wear some good waking sneakers. The temple has many stairs and cliffs to walk on. "
Not really spectacular,"The temple is interesting but not really spectacular. The coastline, on which the temple stands, offers good scenery. Worth a visit but do not expect too much."
Not as interesting as expected,"Compared to the temples we visited in Japan, this was not as well kept nor as interesting although it has a good location by the sea. Lots of steps."
Iconic,"Our introduction to Korea, and most impressive. Although driving distance from the city centre, an essential stop on any list to this country. Everything is pretty self-explanatory, with English language signs and superb views.Try to avoid visiting when large tour groups are there, as it gets very busy.Note. A visit here involves a lot of steps."
Haedong Yonggung Temple,"I visited this temple in April 2015 hoping to get some good photos of it. I got to it from Haeundae, Busan, on the local bus 101. The driver will tell you where to get off but you can't miss it unless you are asleep. I arrived at 0700hr to get the sun coming up in the right direction for photos. The vendors were just setting up food stalls on the approach, 10 minutes walk from the bus stop. The approach is lined with statues of deities and a monument at the top marks the entrance which leads you down some stone steps to the temple. On the way down is the lucky Buddha statue, further down this pretty staircase you can go to the left and get good view of the temple and there is a golden statue and a post box?? This your best view of the temple. When I was there the whole temple was covered in scaffolding so it was impossible to take decent pictures without getting scaffolding in them which was a real pity. This temple is a small one and has a snack bar next to it. In my opinion even though it is in a picturesque setting it is not worth a visit especially with all the scaffolding on it. There are far better temples etc. to see just as good if not better. This was half a day wasted for me. I decided to make the most of the place and decided to take the forest footpath to Songjeong beach. This pleasant looking walk lasted for about 10 minutes before it turned into path with garbage piled on both sides of the path for half a mile. I finally reached the sea but was cut off from the beach by construction earth works and had to walk through ankle deep mud to get to the beach. The beach is very nice and although it was 19deg C it was deserted apart from seaweed collectors. My advice if you don't have too much time in Busan give this one a miss.I hope this helps.Cheers Padkoos"
Beautiful.,Very nice temple to see. Lonely sea side temple in Busan. The view to the sea and the city is beautiful.
One of the must see places in Busan.,"We had an opportunity to visit this temple early this year. If you are looking for a historic temple with a sweeping sea view in Busan, you got to visit here. Peaceful temple, variety of food hawker stalls and kimchis and of course, a great stroll around. It's not recommended for personnel with mobility issues as you got to walk a bit - plains, stairs.. As it was a weekend, the temple was a bit crowded, but still we enjoyed the visit. Would recommend visiting this place."
Lovely temple by the sea!,Unique due to location. Can compare it to Tanah Lot in Bali? But the place is highly commercialised so you will see plenty of tourists. Plenty to see and buy along the roads as well. Interesting place to visit.
Most amazing view,"For me this was the highlight of our Busan trip. The location is so beautiful, right on the cliffs. The temple is going through some major renovation but still we enjoyed it a lot. You can hear Buddhist chants over the speakers at all time, so relaxing. Check out the underground cave too, with fresh drinking water."
"""Breathtaking View"" Must Go again",An eye opening site. We're overwhelmed by this temple n it's surrounding view which was truly an amazing experience
Temple on a mountain/ocean,Nice ocean view when the temple was situated. I had to catch the Busan city tour bus to get here. Good experience
Simply breathtaking,"I am not really religious so I came here for the scenery and the temple structure. It was awesome, and the temple overlooking the ocean, which was great."
Beautiful view,"After all the shopping and city view,it is refreshing to have a sea view with a temple in the evening. The temple and seaview is worth the time despite the long distance from centre Busan. I took a train (40mins then a cab).Amazing how many cats they have here. There are suppose to have some street stalls outside the temple but they close early. I will highly recommend the trip and can do it yourself with no worries."
what an ugly temple,"We've visited this temple because it's the #1 in TA for Busan. When we arrived we asked ourselves 'why?'. This temple as such isn't old, just a reconstruction. The buildings aren't beautiful and the view towards the sea not very nice - because there's a lot of construction going on.We saw in Busan much nicer things than this temple."
Temple by the rock cliff,"You have to travel quite a distance (depending on the area where you stay) from Nampodong area to this temple. Nothing to hype about for this place, can give it a miss without regrets"
I Keep Coming Back,"When visiting Busan, make this temple a priority to see and experience. It doesn't matter what religion you practice. I think anybody can find the significance in the scenery and solitude that you find here. Make sure you bring an open mind because the scenery is simply breathtaking. There are local buses to this temple from Haendae subway. Expect to be on the bus for about thirty buses before reaching the destination but its much cheaper to take the bus compared to a taxi, especially if you are alone."
You will not regret your trip,"We visited this lovely place in the morning and unfortunately it was raining, so bring your umbrella or raincoat. We took a taxi from Haeundae metro station and it took about 30 mins. The place was already crowded with many tourists, mainly Europeans. Since we need to walk up and down the slippery steps due to the rain, wear good comfortable shoes. The view of the temple overlooking the ocean is lovely and you can take some good photos here. Cherry blossom trees were seen in some paths of the surrounding areas.We stayed about an hour and returned to the metro station by taxi which was available outside the temple. We saw Lotte Premium Design Outlet on the return trip but did not stop there; on second thought we should have."
Lovely,"Took a bus down to this place and walked up the hill, not far and easy to walk to. Filled with cherry blossoms on the way its a great way to get there during the spring and on a good sunny day. The place is packed but yet not overcrowded and theres loads of pictures to be taken there.* would recommend to have lunch at the noodle shop just below the roads before heading uphill. Big servings, not bad price and tasty!"
Breathtaking,This little temple overlooking the ocean is simply breathtaking. The gardens leading up to the temple were full of cherry blossoms during our visit which was magical.There are a number of stairs to the temple itself but as long as you are able bodied this shouldn't be a problem. The views are worth it and despite being a cold and windy day i enjoyed the experience.
Picturesque temple perched on a cliff,"We took a cab there from our hotel in Haeundae beach and it cost us about 11,000 won, 20 to 25 min drive up the cliff with pleasant views along the way. April appears to be crowded with local tourists on their religious pilgrimage. Cherry blossom trees line some of the paths in the area. Be sure to have a pair of good sneakers on as the rocky steps leading down to the base of the temple can be slippery. Given the crowds building up by late morning, we only stayed an hour and made our way to the newly opened Lotte Mall, Dong Busan just 10 mins down the road. The mall alos houses a large premium designer outlet if you are into shopping."
Interesting,"I was told that its 108 steps so I stayed around the area. There were food, snacks, veggies & even a cripple man with 2 of his cats. People give alms & pray to their Zodiac stature & hopefully grant them their wish. there are lots of souvenirs of temple beads bracelet, windchime bells, miniatures of owls, pigs, a stall selling hats, soothies..Worth visiting"
Nice place^^ ,Its really an awesome place.. u feel peace & calm here but a pity when we came theres also heavy & windy rain... In fact you can take a cab to the temple from Busan station & it cost about 21000₩ & it only takes about 45mins. You will not need to walk uphill & get tired out before you start exploring the temple^^ 
Popular landmark,"Not too far from city Centre. Several stories attached to this temple. t is steep , up & Down so elderly or disabled may struggle though I saw a few walk it all the same. On the entrance there are several ""korean"" food shacks which can provoke the western olfactory senses. At entry - 12 statues of local Korean Zodiac animals opposite which are elegantly lined Cherry blossom trees which beckon camera & selfie obsessed local tourists. Mainpillar has a ""Tyre"" thats worshipped- I believe local Taxi drivers contributed to pray for their safety. Golden Pigs & Golden Buddha statues on banks of Sea make this beatiful scenic landmark. There is a walkign path for 1-1.5km which leads to maritime museum. several Curio shops allow tourists to buy beads and local stuff. There are no western cuisine restaurants - though there is a coffee & Ice cream shop on campus that is recommended. five min drive to nearest crossing takes you to Korea's Largest Shopping mall. "
Picturesque Yonggungsa Temple,"Sweeping views of the shoreline. Cherry blossoms lined both sides of the road towards Yonggungsa Temple in spring. Sunrise is probably spectacular provided transportation is available. Lotte Premium outlet, an unexpected find, was 1 bus stop away from Haedong Yonggunsa."
"Small temple, but beautiful","This temple is quite small and very busy. The temple itself is nothing to write home home about. But when you add in the fact it's right on the coast it becomes one of the most beautiful and unique temples in South Korea. It is dog friendly, but the subway line does not go out there so you have to bus or taxi if you are going by public transportation."
Very unique location,"I have seen several asian temples, but this one was very unique owing to its location along the coastline."
The temple to visit in Busan,"If you are going to visit one temple in Busan, then this should be it. It is very prettily set against the coastline and the architecture reflects that. There are only a couple of halls, but the overall feel of the temple as a whole is worth the journey. The best way there is to take the 181 bus from outside Centum City or Haeundae metro station. It is about a 20 minute bus ride."
Not just another Temple,The setting sets this Temple apart from all others. Leave enough time to explore the markets leading up to it as well as the multiple levels of the Temple itself.
Beautiful,"The temple was beautiful, perched on the sea cliff, with the waves crashing around the grey rocks, amidst pine trees. Photogs will love it."
"Nice, but crowded temple on the sea","Nice venue, but too crowded. Beautiful views as it is on the sea. Interesting history, 1080 stops of agony (officila name) but easy access for healthy person. I enjoyed. It was just uncomfortably crowded on my Sunday visit."
Beautfule but busy...,"First thing you need to know about travel in Korea, most everywhere you go, you will go with about thousand or more of your Korean friends. Koreans like to travel and they do it in droves. Most every travel site is chocked full of visits. This place is no different. After two years of living here in Korea, we’re still amazed just how many people travel. Remember when visiting that this is a real Buddhist Temple, so please have some reverence for the temple and the people at worship. All of this being said, this place is very beautiful. You can get to the Temple by bus or cab. Bus is only about 1050 won (about a buck) or by Cab 10,000 won ($10) from Busan. When we visited, we traveled by bus to get there and took a cab back into town. From the bus stop there is about a kilometer hike up hill to the parking lot. There are plenty of signs, so just follow the signs up the hill. It can be pretty hot, so water is a must. The first thing you’ll come up to is a big shrine that looks like a big black tire. It’s a shrine for safe driving/travel. Just off to the left you’ll see the entrance to the Temples. Right at the entrance there is the typical mini market place with people selling everything you might want or need for your visit. Plenty of places to get street food. After passing the little market the trail leads down to the ocean. There a lot of steps and stairs up and down. The path is clearly marked, or just follow the throng of people. You’ll pass through some gates and come up to a row of Chinese Zodiac. Just keep following the trail down and you pass through another set of gates. Just as you come in view of the Temples there will be a spilt in the path. From there you can see everything. Now you have the choice of going two different ways. I recommend going both ways. But know either way you go there will be a couple of hundred steps either way you go. The hike is worth it. The trail to the left will take you down towards a rocky outcrop of rocks. You can get some pretty stunning views of Haedong Yonggung Temple. Now head back up to the hill and cross the narrow foot bridge to the main grounds. On the bridge people stop and toss coins into the little stream. There are little statues that have bowls to toss your coins into. The statues are arranged into varying distances making some more difficult to hit. Crossing the bridge there are several temples there and one that is underground. You can spend hours there looking at everything. We spent maybe four hours looking at everything. Don’t for get to visit the Buddha up the hill. The views are incredible. You will also find a restaurant and restrooms on the grounds. You might want to wear good walking or hiking shoes as there is a lot of walking involved when visiting this temple. We recommend that you visit earlier in the day before the heaviest crowds arrive. Another note about the busses. In the afternoon the buses leaving the Temple were very full. We waited about an hour wait to get on the bus. We got tired of waiting and caught a cab. It was worth the crowds and all the walking. We tend to wall all the time anyways. For those who have problems with walking or stairs might have trouble with visiting. You might think about visiting at sunrise for the best photo opportunities and smallest crowds. The sun sets on behind the hill the temple sits on. When visiting Busan take the side trip to Haedong Yonggung Temple."
Catch the amazing Sunrise here!,"To make your trip here a memorable one, I would recommend getting here by 6am to watch the sun rise. My friends and I went during the tail-end of Winter on 9 March and the temperature was freezing cold at 0 degrees. We stay at Elsee Hotel at Nampodong and took a cab here which cost us 130,000 won, both ways - which was pretty convenient and cheap since we split the cost. We woke at 4am to prepare, left our hotel at 5am and got to Younggunsa Temple at 6am. The sunrise for that day was slated at 645am so we spent the first part of the walk down admiring the scenery. The sunrise was spectacular given that you have a first-class seat of the red yolk rising from the sea. Amazing experience! The golden Buddha and the temple surroundings were also a joy to explore given that the surroundings were quite tranquil. Going early in the morning has its benefits as there were lesser people/tourists around.Didn't try to take public transport since the trains/buses don't start so early. While we were on our way back, we spotted some people waiting for buses and in the end gave up and tried to hail cabs but cabs were few and far between.Tip: Getting here to watch the sunrise is highly recommended. A few food stalls only open at around 8.30am while we were about to leave and we managed to get some snacks."
Temple on the cliff,"This is a well known temple that is built on the cliff with nice scenery. This is a beautiful place, is worth the time travelling here. It is not difficult to travel here by public transport. From Haeundae subway Station, go out by exit 7 and walk to the bus stop next to it. Take bus 181, for about 25 mins and dropped off at ""Yonggungsa Temple"" stop. From the bus stop,need to walk uphill 10 mins to get to the Haedong Yonggungsa Temple. There are food and drink stalls before the temple entrance. It advisable to wear comfortable shoes as there are lots of stairs to climb up and down."
Beautiful Temple,"We took a train to Jangsan and later took a cab in which cost arond w6000. I will recomended that instead of taking bus and had a long walk in. The temple is beautiful although small, the design of the temple is detail and in bright colours. The view of the ocean is breath taking. After a couple of days in Seoul; this is refreshing change. Highly recommeded!"
Great view,It's located quite far from city centre. We took subway to Haeundae and continue with bus no 100. We got off in Lotte Mall and walked about 15 minutes to reach the temple. It is not big but quite a view because the temple is located on a cliff edge. There are snack stalls on the way entering the temple.
Full of culture,"Great place to visit and get some culture out of your trip, especially if your a Buddhist! Awsome temple situated right on the shores of the pacific. Good view and many places to pray if your so inclined. Lots of walking and many stairs to climb, so if that's not your style then steer clear, but the climb is worth the visit. Great photo ops, but if you venture down to the ocean shore, be careful, very slippery (I may have slipped into the ocean a bit lol)"
Wonderful historical temple,This attraction is far from the city center. The only best way for the travelers to reach here is using taxi. It was about 40 minutes from Haundae beach to Haedong Yonggung Temple. The temple is built years ago and worth a visit if you would like to pray and take scenery pictures. 
Great Temple (not easy to find if you travel on your own),"had spent a few days in busan, and stayed over night in Haeundae, so decided to visit the Haedong Yongung Temple due to its uniqueness being adjacent to the water. Tip, if travelling by public transport, its doable, from Haeundae subway take exit 7, and go on bus 181, (also 100) its about 30 mins, you will need to keep an eye out, its the stop after you see the gigantic Lotte Mall (i believe just recently opened, its like a castle with blue and most of the building painted white). I went to the long way walking up the hill, however on the way back, i exited the temple via the way to the Fish Museum, i believe this may be the short cut back to bus stop. ( I did a pit stop at the Fish Museum, lots to see, great especially if you have little ones they will love this place, theres also an area where you can see lots of live fish and one mini turtle).At the temple theres reasonable number of street food, i didnt try any but believe it should be ok as some of the locals were eating.If getting lunch , i suggest you take a stroll to the Lotte Mall, that i mentioned thats nearby heaps of choices, but I ended up going to Korea Food buffet.(quite nice and reasonably priced)"
Peaceful and beautiful,It looked interesting in the pictures and we decided that we had to go even though it was a bit out of the way. We explored the area and stopped a few times to just admire the place. It was beautiful and the pictures we took there turned out wonderful. Do take the time (and effort!!-many steps) to go to the place by the cliffs where you can enjoy watching the waves and admire the temple from afar. I sat there just admiring the beauty of this whole place when I was there. 
Interesting sightseeing but a bit hard to go,"The temple is beautiful and interesting. Site is nice. All gimmick about lucky symbol to pray are varies from transportation to health and study to wealth. Few street foods and souvenir kiosks are there. Nice restaurant and cafe are nearby.**Warning: may not convenience for older people or people with health condition especially legs. Because the walk way is high and steep.By visiting there by ourselves I think it's a bit tired. Have to ride subway then change to public bus no.181 I think. (the service bus to the temple is limited and not operate all day)---> while the public bus is a bit hard for foreigners because driver can't speak English and there is no English information such as the name of bus stop...yes completely not! So I recommend to look carefully to the Korean name alphabet in each stop and count the stops. <I like the local restaurant in front of the bus stop before climb up to the temple, grilled fish and fish soup are so yummy! The smaller one in white building near the temple bus stop.>"
Makes You Stop In Your Tracks,"My wife and I were in Gamcheon village when we met some young Koreans who we're also sightseeing. We became friends and ended up adenturing the rest of the day with them. The Haedong temple can be a challenge to get to through the city traffic but it was well worth the effort. As a westerner, the place will capture your imagination and never let go. The views are absolutely breathtaking. Places like this are the reason expensive cameras are made."
