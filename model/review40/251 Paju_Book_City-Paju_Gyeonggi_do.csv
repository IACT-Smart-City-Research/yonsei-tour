A cultural experience in Paju Book City,"If you're an architecture or arts lover, Paju Book City is a place you should visit when you're in South Korea. There're a few iconic photo taking sites in the building such as standing inbetween tall book shelves. This is definitely the place for people who are interested in getting korean books as there are way too many korean books catered to different age groups. You can enjoy drinking in Cafe Pascucci (which is located in Paju Book City) while reading books. Suitable for family (with young children), friends and couples."
Paju Book City,We had a very pleasant stay in Paju City. Away from the hustle and noise of Seoul. We also went to the DNZ from here as Paju is about 10 kilometres from the North Korean border.
Away from the crowds,"If you've tired of the hordes, a trip to Paju Book City is a godsend. Recently visited on a Sunday afternoon and I counted on one hand the people I saw on the street. Took in a movie at the Megabox cinema and then cruised a couple of book cafe/ coffee shops. Take 200 bus from Daehwa Station in Ilsan."
Must visit if you are a book-lover,"The city of Paju is well-known to domestic and foreign visitors as a city where they can indirectly experience North Korea but recently it is gaining a fame as a stylish city where visitors can have special memories. Paju Book City is an industrial district where many publishers gather together. There are many unique book cafes and restaurants. Among them, I'd love to recommend a place named 'Forest of Wisdom' surrounded by many books. You could take a seat where you want and enjoy reading books free of charge until closed. Even in the building where the special book place is located, there is a guesthouse named 'Jijihyang'. Each room has books written by an author or issued by a publisher so you can read them while staying the room. If you are a book-lover and has a plan to visit Paju, don't miss to visit there. "
"Great for walks, ice shaving in summer, green","Its a nice place to visit together with Paju provence village. There are many cute cafes and restaurants, and lots of green areas, great for walking. I think they just opened an outdoor cinema too. "
Our day out to Paju,"The family and I visited Paju on Christmas Day and loved it. Very nice place with many beautiful/artistic buildings and museums. Plenty of cafes to wind down after all the walking too!Around an hour by bus from Seoul, would definitely revisit if I have the chance! "
Nice Architecture Surrounds,"Paju Book City is surrounded by terrific architecture structures and buildings. It's a pretty quiet city on its own, but the trip to the book city's library and cafe was quite an eye opener. Worth a trip there if you're an architecture or arts lover. "
Library lover for family,"It is a cool library town for whole family, events and picnics, wonderful bike leisure, calm library atmosphere, fairytale village for kids, chic architectures."
Publishing haven; chic architecture,"It took us about an hour by chartered bus to Paju Book City from Seoul. When I got off the bus, I got curious about the peaceful surroundings. The modern/hip buildings--which house publishing companies, book stores, art galleries, cafes, and even a hotel--were healthily spaced apart. It did feel a bit sterile and cold for me, esp. since I was expecting more traditional hanok types of structures than very modern ones.I was able to do a short tour with my colleagues to see some publishing houses' facades, and also other buildings including the Pinocchio Museum. Too bad we didn't have time to go check out the museum itself. We did, however, go to the Culture and Info Center where the ""Forest of Wisdom"" is housed--book shelves line the walls from floor to ceiling! It's definitely a bookworm's dream.We had business meetings there, so there was very little time to explore the Center as well as the other buildings in the complex. Will definitely go there again to carefully check out the exhibits/galleries as well as buy books."
Autumn in Paju Book City,"This place is quite good to take a walk alone. When I want to come up with some ideas, I used to visit here."
Fairytale village ,You can see every corner fairytale characters and rest place Good for piknick with lunch box there are good libraries you can calm to study 
Nice Architecture,"All buildings have nice architectures. Center of Book & Publishing. Some book stores, stationary stores and museums. "
Paju book city is amazing,"an amazing place in an amazing town, lived there for over 1 year, this place has advance technology and lots of interesting activities to offer. close to ilsa and to the subway station blue line and orange line. accessible from any part of Seoul. must go. "
Nice but don't go out of your way to come here,This is the book publishing hub of South Korea. It is a group of many small companies and a lot of great architecture. The area is walk-able in an hour. The area is beautifully landscaped and calming with little cares all around. It is very close to the Lotte outlets so you can do a day trip and see both.
