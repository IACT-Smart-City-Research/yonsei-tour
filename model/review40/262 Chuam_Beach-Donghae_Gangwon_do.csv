Small and beautiful beach.,"CC+c ( 19.05.17 ) My family visited this beach for viewing Candlestick Rock. The beach was not big area, but beautiful and calm. Though another beach in East Sea was good, this beach was more calm and good. Some restaurant was operating, and proper size to enjoy sea. One of good beach in Gangwon-do."
Beautiful Beach,This is a very beautiful beach right near the candlestick structure. The surf pounding the beach late in the afternoon is awesome. 
Day is better than night,"It is recommended to go there in the day rather than at night. The view is more beautiful but there is constructiom going on so it would not be as beautiful, yet."
Beautiful beach,Beautiful and busy beach. Lots of umbrella and safety tube facilities. Lots of eateries opposite beachfront Water good swimming temparature
Far East coast,"Clear water, Great scenic view,Good food and Friendly people. The Perfect weekend scape with family in relaxed atmosphere."
Relaxing afternoon at Chuam Beach,This is a wonderful place to relax and enjoy the beautiful sea view while sipping a cup of tea at a cafe just along the beach. The caf√© even played the theme songs from a few of the Korean hit drama. Such a nice cosy ambience .Remember to bring along a big straw hat and apply enough sunscreen as there are not many places with shade. The sea is very clear and the place is currently not crowded with people.
