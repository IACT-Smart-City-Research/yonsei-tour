Interesting and efficient tour,"We took a half-day tour that efficiently covered a few interesting spots including the conference room.Our guide was friendly and spoke good English, and made sure everyone on the bus could hear. For the most part he was informative and interesting, and for the most part what we were told seemed to be free of bias or anti-NK propaganda.Unfortunately I've got to remove one star for the random anti-Japanese remark he made about Japanese being stingy - that kind of racism was totally off topic and uncalled for. He managed to get it in before the Japanese tour group joined our bus, but I wonder if he still would've made it if he'd known I live in Japan?"
There are better tours available,"My father died in the Korean War and we booked this tour to learn more about the DMZ and Korea. The pros: good lunch, comfortable back support, safe driver. The cons:We were provided with an English speaking tour guide who spoke for most of the ride to the DMZ, but the only attendees able to hear were in the first half of the bus. The engine noise did not allow the back half of the bus to hear what was spoken.We arrived early in hopes of getting seats in the front but seating was assigned and we were in the furthest rear seats. This tour company used a bus not designed for a proper tour. The speaker system was portable and not installed in the bus, thereby providing sound only to those near the guide. I was on the ""sunny"" side of the bus round trip and there was not a curtain in my window to protect me from heat and sun. I would not recommend this company."
The JSA section is what I wanted!,"The folks running this are all very well organized and people friendly. I had only wanted to see the JSA section and that was every bit what I wanted to experience. The rest as okay, lunch was fine as where the other stops but i can eat Korean food out and about in Seoul while there so that was not a highlight for me. But the JSA, that is pretty awesome! Did the Saturday at 11 AM tour as it was the only one I could fit in."
A unique experience that sheds light on the conflict between the two Koreas,"My husband and I took the full-day Panmunjom/DMZ Combined Tour on our recent trip to Seoul. It was a fascinating experience. The tour takes you to the Joint Security Area (JSA) where you receive a military briefing from the United Nations Command and visit the blue buildings where various discussions/negotiations between the two Koreas have occurred. From an observation area you are able to view armed North Korean soldiers standing guard just metres away, which brings the still-unresolved conflict and physical stand-off into sharp relief. The 2nd half of the day is devoted to visiting Freedom Bridge (a former-railroad bridge that was used to repatriate POWs returning from North Korea immediately after the war), the Dora Observatory (which offers a view of North Korea's uninhabited Propaganda Village, known as Peace Village to the North Koreans), the 3rd Tunnel (one of several massive underground tunnels believed to have been built by the North Koreans to infiltrate South Korea) and the Dorason Train Station (which once connected North and South Korea but is currently inactive). Although all of these afternoon sights were of historical interest, there was not a lot to actually see, with the exception of the infiltration tunnel, which offered a more immersive and visceral experience. Note that to visit the infiltration tunnel requires taking a small mine-style railway down a narrow shaft (picture entering a coal mine), wearing hard hats, and walking through a damp tunnel with very low ceilings and uneven ground, which was fine for us but would not be ideal for anyone with mobility issues or claustrophobia. The day ended with a question and answer period on the bus ride back to Seoul with a North Korean defector, which was the most revelatory and human part of the experience, providing a rare glimpse of life across the border and the harsh daily conditions faced by North Koreans. All in all, this was a very interesting tour. Our only complaint was that our tour guide was not fully fluent in English, which meant that it was sometimes difficult to have more subtle or complex questions answered. This surprised us somewhat because we met many fluent English speakers in Korea. Despite this shortcoming, however, we found this a rich and educational experience. (Note: That there is a dress code to visit the Joint Security Area; dress in business-casual but with comfortable shoes.)"
Must do the DMZ tour!,Don't miss out on a unique opportunity to see this living history. Access varies almost hour by hour in this dynamic environment. We were fortunate to get access in to the JSA and were just metres from North Korea. Lunch was very a good traditional meal. Be aware that the Third Tunnel is very low and tight (anyone taller than 160cm will be stooping). All in all a very informative and interesting day. 
Good half-day tour,"Selected this tour over others due to the responsiveness of staff to initial email inquires. The tour takes a half day (8:30am-2:30pm) and covers the basics of the JSA, including the ability to visit the conference room. For a more detailed overview of this historic area suggest a full day tour to cover the wider DMZ. Was a bit disappointed that unlike other tours this one did not include interaction with US personnel who it appears do some other tours but it was nevertheless still very good and worth the trip. Our tour guide Sunmi was nice and her English was easy to understand. Lunch was included and good. Reasonable price for tour that checks the 'been there, done that' box."
The best tour so far in all my travels across the world...,"We booked this tour a month in advance by mailing them scanned copy of our passports. The tour got approved in 3 days time but still they were unsure as it can be cancelled due to security reasons at the last moment. We reached Lotte Hotel on time and the bus which takes us to the full day (DMZ + JSA) tour started bang on time. Our guide was a sweet lady who was not very fluent in English but had a lot of humour. The tour throughout was conducted in a very professional manner and the lunch (Beef Bulgogi) was awesome. The best part of this tour was the Dorasan station and the JSA tour in the UN bus. Never been part of a live war zone. Hence extremely thrilling and nerve wrenching. Thank you for giving us the tour of our life in KRW 130,000."
ICSC a great tour option,"This tour was one of the highlights of our trip to Korea. We booked our tour through ICSC and I think we made the best choice. Staff were very helpful and also had a good level of English. We booked before we left Australia and this was all handled by email in English and was easily completed. The tour office is located in Lotte Hotel - so relatively central and easy to find.We had a particular challenge with children who were too young to go to Panmunjom. With the other companies my husband and sons would have had to go on a completely separate tour from me (who wanted to go to Panmunjom/JSA). With ICSC we were able to stay together for the first part of the trip - to Imjingak, 3rd Tunnel via monorail, Dora Observatory, and Dorasan Station and lunch. After lunch my husband and children returned to Seoul and another bus collected me and a few other passengers for the Panmunjom/JSA section.The tour guides on both the first part and second part of the tour were great. A younger woman on the first part spoke passionately about the desire for a unified Korea and was very insightful/knowledgeable about the history. The older woman on the 2nd part of the tour was also knowledgeable and also had a fantastic sense of humour. She kept us informed every step of the way through the entrance to the JSA - which can be a bit daunting.Both the half day tour that my husband and sons went on, and the full day tour I went on, were very comprehensive - we got to see all the major sights."
Panmunjeom is a must visit!,"Visiting the Panmunjeom is a must when you're in Seoul. ICSC's tour was well-organized but not really exceptional. Lunch was quite good. The tour guide was very knowledgeable and friendly but her English was hard to follow. In addition, half the tour group were Japanese so there were always two languages going. But don't miss the NK experience whoever you go with !"
Half-Day Tour to JSA,"One of the main things I wanted to do whilst in Korea was to get to the JSA.We booked through the ICSC via email- an easy process.We had a knowledgeable tour guide with a great grasp of English. Stopping off for Korean food before heading to Freedom Bridge for half an hour. When we entered Camp Boniface we were taken under the wing of the US Army who then conducted the rest of the tour.I am thrilled to have visited, it exceeded my expectations. ICSC were flawless through the process.One must remember that as soon as you enter the JSA you are to do as told at the discretion of the American soldiers. On our trip we had to miss out certain parts of the itinerary so be prepared for change- it is out of the hands of ICSC."
"Average Tour, USO tour is better","This was my second time doing a DMZ tour. The first time I booked through the USO and was very, very impressed with that tour. When my friend came to visit me in Seoul I decided to book the Panmunjom tour through the ICSC instead. However, I was a bit disappointed in this tour compared to the one with USO. The English tour guide was good. She was easy to understand and had a good sense of humor. But our tour had both an English group and a Japanese group which meant the two tour guides had to share the microphone on the bus in order to say everything in two languages. The briefing at the JSA was very hard to hear and understand since it was being done in two languages at the same time. I much preferred the USO tour since they have an actual US soldier do the briefing and touring through the JSA. I felt like he was able to provide much more information than our tour guide on this tour did. This tour is fine if you want the bare minimum, average tour, but I would strongly recommend booking a tour through the USO instead."
"Full Day Tour - Unique experience, good operator",This tour was the best part of my trip to Seoul. I went on the full day tour that stopped at Dorasan Station / Dora Observatory/ 3rd Infiltration Tunnel in the morning and Panmunjeom Joint Security Area in the afternoon. In the JSA there is a conference room that straddles the Military Demarcation Line between North and South Korea and you can walk to the North Korean side of the room and briefly visit North Korea! Lunch in a traditional Korean restaurant was included in the full day tour (a vegetarian option was available).The tour operator did a good job. There were different guides for the morning and afternoon sections and both were enlightening and entertaining. The Service Club/TourDMZ office is in the Lotte Hotel near Myeongdong. I stayed at the Metro Hotel which was on the next block.If you’ve got time I recommend a visit to the War Memorial & Museum of Korea before going on this tour - it will put the DMZ and the tour content in a historical context.
Do combined DMZ tour,"We had an enjoyable day at the DMZ - we did the full day tour for W120,000 which covered JSA (border) and the 3rd infiltration tunnel. You should do both of these - the tour fitted well together and we had tow good guides. This company seems to be cheaper than many of the other commercial ones."
Must do in Seoul,"Went on the DMZ tour while in Seoul, and I have to say it is a must do. Lots of great history and puts much of the current environment in perspective. It also is a reminder for those of us who don't live in this environment, that this fight is not over. A couple suggestions: 1) if you do the tunnel tour, make sure you line up the monorail to take you down and up. Long steep walk otherwise. Also, if you are more than 6' 3"", could be a challenge as the tunnel height is less than 6'. 2) You must do the second half of the tour that goes to the Joint Security Area. That is the real rush to get right to the border and see some history. 3) The RoK army takes this seriously so expect some delays as they process things. I will say that there is a bit of repeat on the commentary and some of the things you do, but worth it for the overall experience."
Great DMZ Tour!,"We have a great time at the DMZ tour. We selected the combined tour for 120,000 and the tour was smooth and our guide was very informative. I've written a detailed blog about this experience here: http://twotravellingpassports.tumblr.com/post/42123334085/demilitarized-zone-dmz-tour-of-north-and-south-koreaHighly recommended."
DMZ tour,"My daughter and I did the full day tour visiting the third tunnel and the border with lunch and hotel pick up and return included. It was a very full on day with minimal time at each destination. The history was interesting, but nothing more than you could pick up from a book. The third tunnel was a long walk with nothing really to see and as it was raining we could not see the border either. Price wise it was great value and we are thank full we got a pick up and return from the hotel due to the rain. If you are into history probably a good pick, if you are just a general tourist I wouldn't say this was the best way to spend your time."
Scary but very interesting,We visited here last year at the end of a 2 week trip. Very interesting. You must do both tours as the second part of the tour is scary but eye-opening. We stood in North Korea. The scary bit was stood opposite the North Korean building with curtains twitching and a guard popping out from behind a pillar every now and then and the fact that you had to be quiet and not move.You have to make up your own mind as the South Koreans will tell you what they want you to know.Guide was very good. Meal was also provded with the tour.
"DMZ tour, truly gripping, a must in Seoul","We loved the DMZ tour. The day started at 9 when we got on a coach from one of the numerous lotte hotels around Seoul. The group was divided into English and Japanese speaking tourist. Whilst en route to the dmz, The Japanese were given a long 40 min brieffing. The English brieffing followed after, given by our funny, charismatic tour guide. Upon arriving at the DMZ our coach was inspected by the military. Each of us had to hold out our passports as the men walked around the coach. Entering the DMZ was a harrowing experience, upon driving past the concrete walls, barbed wire and endless roadblocks, the chatty Japanese tourists in the front, and the noisy American tourists in the back all went dead quiet. During the tour we visited dorsan, the only railway station connecting the south and North, one of the infiltration tunnels and an observatory point from which we could see the neighbouring north Korean town. A truly unique and interesting experience. Well recommended!"
Recommended,"Took the tour from tourdmz.com, went for the combined tour at a cost of 120,000won which worked out to be approx £67 .Its a bit of a pain they do not do hotel pick up, so you have to make your way to the Lotte hotel near city hall.Having said all that tour was well run, we did the DMZ in the morning and the JSA in the afternoon, im not sure i would have wanted to have missed out on either part so would recommend doing or the full day combined tour. Lunch was bulgogi (beef in stock with rice and pickles) with a vegetarian option. Plenty of photo opps, didnt seem to rushed apart from JSA which is not under the control of the tour guide anyway.No big pressure to tip or buy souvenirs which always makes a refreshing change when travelling. Nice tour very unique and is to be recommended. I reserved online, and paid on the day."
A back pain-inducing but fun activity,"Took the morning half- day tour. The tour entails many stops but what stands out is the trip down the tunnel which the North koreans dug through the supposedly demilitarized zone. The tunnel inclines down at a supposedly 10 degree angle but it was definitely more than that. We went down running pulled by gravity- our poor lower back receiving much pressure as we attempt to remain upright and not end up rolling like a ball. After 5 minutes the tunnel settles evenly and it was now our helmeted head that took some slight beating as the ceiling at several points dips low. What I described was actually the fun part. It got tough as we went back up along the supposedly 10 degree incline. This part separates those who do their cardio religiously and the sad, unfit slackers. Good thing there were chairs strategically placed for those mulling on climbing out on stretcher. Note- there is a monorail for the those who dare not take this fun challenge. Unfortunately for me, it was broken when we visited."
