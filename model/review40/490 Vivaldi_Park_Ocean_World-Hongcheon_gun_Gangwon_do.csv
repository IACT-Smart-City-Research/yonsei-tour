Great water park!,It was a great experience and personally think it is slightly better than the Caribbean Bay. More food varieties and facilities are more organised. But the slides and waves are not as exciting than the Caribbean ones
Summer escape ,"What a fun day at Vivaldi Park Ocean World! My friend and I went there last weekend, and we had so much fun Lots of rides, cafes and good changing room facilities One thing tho, I would definitely recommend going there during the week, as we went on Sunday and let’s just say- it was PACKED so we had to wait long lines for slides & rides~ Other than that, it’s a perfect getaway "
We went during the winter season but is still good fun.,"We stayed at the Vivaldi Oak Suite for a 4 nights and took ski lessons. We spent one afternoon at the next door Ocean World. It's only a 10 mins walk to the ocean world from our hotel. It's all heated indoor, and the water is quite warm, so it is still okay to go. At first, I thought it might be too cold. Once you went in, they had a ticket counter. I think is 50,000 Won for adults and 40,000 for kids. Then, they would give you a key to put on your wrist, and there was a number on the key, and that's the number for your lockers for shoes and inside the changing room. They have a huge sauna area in the ladies changing room and the men changing room. After you walk out from the changing room, then is the main play area. They have a lazy river, a small lap pool, a large kids playing area with slides and huge bucket on top that pours water down every 5 mins, jacuzzi, a small children play area where they can scoop the gold fish, and 2 long slides for older children above 120cm. My daughter was presently surprised to find a slime corner at the entrance level, where you pay 50,000 won or something to play with a cup of slime and some decorations and to bring home. That's the highlight for her. I enjoy the hot tub jacuzzi both near the pool and inside the ladies changing room. Overall, it's good fun, especially after a day of skiing.. will definitely go back. "
water park & winter ski resort,"world big 4th water park. winter ski world resort. 2,500,000 peoples come every year세계 4대 워터파크이고 강원도에 위치하기 때문에 연중 2백5십만명 이상이 찾는 유명 리조트이다.외국인들도 많이 오고 서울 경기 충청지역에서 무료셔틀버스를 이용할 수 있어 인기가 높다."
Need to pay for everything ,"Spent 5hrs in ocean world with my 5yr old daughter, height of about 110cm. For families with younger children or height below 120cm, or those who are planning to drive, please read my review. Please be prepared to pay for everything within the park. I know most parks do not provide towels for free, ocean world is not an exception too. But i am surprised i have to pay to rent the life vests and sun beds, which most theme parks would provide for free. I m saying sun beds, not cabanas. Well it comes as a shock to us that we have to pay for everything else after paying entrance fees of $160 in total. Theme parks such as Atlantis in Dubai or adventure cove in Singapore, do not even charge for sun beds or life vests. You may be thinking ok i will do without a life vest, sorry, they insist on their patrons putting on life vests for most of their pools. Note: -parking in located right in front of the theme park, just drive to the entrance of the park, you’ll see a multi storey carpark-signages to park is not clearly visible, pls take note if you r driving. I did not know the carpark is right in front and hence parked across the road, and had problems finding the main entrance. They have 2 entrances, 1 located near the youth hostel, that entrance is for groups. The other entrance is at the opposite end of youth hostel, nearer to vivaldi main centre. So just drive to main entrance as per your gps instructions. Carpark is there and main entrance is right there too.-pls pick up an info guide from info counter next to ticket booth and read it carefully. They are very systematic. Shoes needs to be removed immediately upon entering and kept in lockers.-pls get a coin band for all purchases within the park at the coin band counter once u pass the entrance. No cash or card is accepted within the park for all rentals and food n drinks.-no outside food and drinks is allowed, they would ask and check your bags. Kids’ water bottles seems to be fine. -entrance to the slides and play area is accessible through the stairways in the changing room. Meaning, if you have a son and the father is not with you, your son would have to go to the men’s changing room by himself and meet you at the entrance after going down the stairways and vice versa. No way you can enter together. For younger kids, this may be a problem if the same gender parent is not around. -everything is in korean, announcements too. -staff don’t really speak English fluently or understand english very well. Pls be prepared for that. signages are in multi languages though.-Please bring your own towels otherwise you’ll have to pay to rent towels too. -pools in indoor area are heated -Please book your tickets in advance which i did, so you won’t have to wait for admission time. The park do not allow more than a certain number of visitors at one time, hence, patrons have to wait for the time allocated to them to enter the park. Tickets bought in advance can enter without waiting. Was glad i did that. Anyway i had a hard time searching for tickets online, Klook did not update theirs, still winter tickets....KKday don’t have either. I emailed damyeung to ask if i can purchase online tickets anywhere, nobody replied my email. I finally found tickets on indiway. Hope this helps. Or perhaps, you may try klook again.-do not be alarmed, people walk around naked in the changing room. And do not stare, its rude in their culture. Basically nobody would be bothered by one another’s nudity. Its part of their korean sauna culture.-all patrons MUST wear a hat/cap/swimming cap/bandana OR rash guards with hoodies is fine too.-sun is scorching hot and glaring but its windy and chilly at the same time around this time of the year, pls prepare your kids to brave the weather conditions in advance.Ocean world is a huge water theme park, consisting of several zones, including a indoor zone. This indoor zone basically is a miniature of whatever slides, playground, heated pool, massage pool and lagoon they have outdoor.It is especially made for kids like my daughter, height below 110cm. They are extremely strict with height restrictions and will have their staff roaming around taking the kids’ height. If your kid is over 110cm, they are NOT allowed to play in the indoor playground. Yup, over the height limit, please use outdoor playground, which means if your children are of ages 5 and 8 etc, 1 has to play indoor, the other pls proceed outside. I am not saying that older kids are not allowed indoor, but definitely not at the playground. Other areas is fine. I must say my daughter had a splashing good time in the indoor zone. For adults i think it can be quite boring if you have a young kid in tow. I yawned several times in the park. Think height limit is way too strict, if the kids are accompanied by guardians, there should be some exceptions to use their bigger outdoor lagoons which seems to be more fun and exciting, just like most other theme parks. But your kids need to be at least 120cm-130cm. 120cm accompanied by guardians, 130cm to go alone. Well i guess its a safety precaution which I cannot blame them. There are many heated pools, massage pools and jacuzzis within the park as well, something that i have not encountered in water theme parks, which is a plus point. They have their traditional saunas in the park itself, if you would like to use the facility, you have to pay extra. Pls avoid going on a Public holiday. I made a mistake not looking up their local calendar and booked the tickets on a PH. The park was swarmed by their locals, i would say its over crowded. We went on a 21 days road trip in South korea with my 5 yo daughter. If you have any qns with regards to driving etc, do feel free to ask. I will try to help. Hope my review will help you plan your trip better. "
Vivaldi!!!,"It's a winter wonderland!!!Ski, cable car, snow, snow boarding... very very cold! White Christmas and everything!"
Surprisingly Crowded During Early Winter,"We bought discounted tickets from Funtastic Korea. Didn’t notice the fine print that the vouchers had to be PRINTED (no access to printer in korea), but decided to try our luck anyway. Luckily the ticket office was flexible and did not deny us entrance to the Ocean World.It was early winter, and only the indoor section was open. I was surprised to find the indoor section so crowded (weekday afternoon)! It’s not school holidays yet. Don’t the local children have to attend school? Although there were no queues for the pools, the noise level from squealing kids knock off one star from the review.Dr Fish (extra charges apply) was cool! The wave pool was a hit with the kids. I found the water not warm enough though. So I spent more time in other massage pools. Again, very crowded.Some tips:1) Cash not accepted in the compound. Please charge wrist band before entry. Minimum charge 10,000 won.2) Life jacket compulsory is wave pool and indoor flow. Rent at 6,000 won.3) Swimming cap compulsory. Buy at 4,000 won."
Good place,Big and nice place to have excellent time.ticket prices is same regardless which time you go so it had better to visit as early as possible.For foreigners there is a 30% discount. that is very nice )))Closing time is 7pm. be sure to have good time before that time.Enjoy )
Fun Day!,"Really enjoyed Ocean World. Booked on klook and klook gave the wrong info on the voucher re the timing and korea contact number, so we did not get the bus on Friday. Contacted Daemyung Resort directly and the service was great, they found us the local provider who solved the problem and brought us there the next day.Ocean World is very well organised, with place to keep your shoes, lockers, towels, plastic bags for your wet clothes. There's a hot tub / bath area after you are done with the park. It was kind of cold but there were tons of people there. The longest wait was 1 hour for the monster blaster which is only open without reservation after 3pm. The other slides (both indoor and outdoor) were all good fun. There were jacuzzis everywhere so we hid in those from the cold. And the extreme river and wave pool's waves were real large and amazing. Perhaps one improvement could be the food though, as there's not much choice (most stores sell the same food). Ride from Seoul took about 2 hours both ways (free shuttle bus)."
tourist package deal 35000 won w/ sleigh ride 2 hr,"Got the tourist package for 25t won, The sleigh ride is ok, for a few mins than you get bored of it fast. but the water park is great for kids, Adult go to the spa where you HAVE to be NUDE/ NAKED. They have all what you expect from a spa/ water bath in asia. First time I experience it and I liked it."
Fantastic,"One of the best water park in South Korea. Less crowded and less expensive, but has many different rides and swimming pool. Food here are delicious too."
A hidden paradise just couple of hours from Seoul,"Vivaldi park is a popular resort open all year round. It is easy to access it from Seoul by bus, which according to the tourist visitkorea.com website is free for foreigners. The buses leave Dongseoul bus terminal and are very frequent, almost every hour. The resort itself is located on a mountain and is very popular and busy pretty much all the time. During the summer months the main attraction is 'ocean world', which is one of Korea's famous water parks and definitely worth a visit if you have the time. According to their website it has the longest water slide in Korea! It is family friendly and offers a great variety of rides and pools to suit all tastes. Also, for golf lovers it is the place to be as the mountain is used as a massive golf course.In the winter it operates as a 24h ski resort. Coming from Europe where the slopes and lifts are shut before night time, I was surprised to see that there was a longer queue on the lifts at 2am than 10 in the morning! The slopes are generally short rides but they are for all levels and abilities, including one only for snowboarders. The main building complex has a number of restaurants, coffee shops, a mini market, a small cinema, ping pong, pool tables, darts and a bowling alley among other things. As it is expected it is a bit overpriced but not by much.You can book accommodation to stay over night. There are few hotel buildings that overlook the resort and the view from the rooms must be stunning.Overall, it is a great place to visit any time of the year. Highly recommended!"
"Good accessibility from Seoul, but crowded.","A big ski resort with hot spring pool called 'Ocean World'. Very well access from Seoul cause it has a many free ride suttle bus for Vivaldy Park from capital areas.(But you should have to reservation a free suttle at the VivaldyPark website before you ride)There are many but shortl length of slopes, and many lifts for going up to the top.But too many people on weekend, so that you should wait for a long time for going up.(Especially, novice/bigginer level of ski)Despite crowded site, it would be a very special expirences that you can enjoy ski and hot spring pool at the one resort. (Moreover, from 17:00 o'clock, it's a free entry for hot spring who bought ski lift riding ticket) At the summer seasons, it's a famous vacation site for whom want to go on a waterside. (And very very crowded also)There is perfect hotel facilities in basefloor beneath on hotel, it's very convenient for everyone."
Skii,First time that I did skii in my life and it was pretty cool. The roads were cool and the people was really nice . 
Water theme park next to a skiing resort,"Going to Vivaldi Park from Seoul take less than 2 hours but the traffic jam can be bad and take much longer time.The lack of signs in English and the staff can't speak English is a problem. Here I am reviewing the water park which has an Egyptian theme. We pay our entrance fees and get an access no. like a watch to wear on our hand for lockers and various payments. We put our shoes in the shoes locker and will be separated into male and female sections. So if you want to meet your partner, tell them to meet at the children pools or fish spa in let say about 20mins. You can rent all sort of swimming gears, enjoy the fish spa, buy burgers and refreshment by swiping your locker no. and pay when you exit.After meeting my partners, we went to the outdoor park, passed the herbal fragrance pools, sauna pools and into the big slide. Have great fun here. I was looking for the natural hot spring and could not find one, I could have missed an entrance into the natural hot spring or is this just a water park with ""hotwater""? Correct me if I am wrong! We used the various pools, and later go to the indoor or children pools for the waves pool, cold big splash and massage pool.After that we went our separate way, I went to the female jjimjilbang. striped and enjoyed the mint, pomegranate fragrance hot pool. I can't stay longer as much as I wanted to, went to the shower area to shower, next to the dressing rooms, there are hair dryers, comb, hair gel, body gel and plastic bag for your wet suit.The water park is clean and life guards everywhere ."
Fun place to go!!,"Back in May 2014 I had a great day with my friend but we needed to go back to Seoul and that made me upset because we were having so much fun. I was very pleased about everything so one day I would come back ready to have more fun. We played at the spacious swimming pool and the water slides. There were lots of water slides and one of my favorite was the inside, that was so fast and fun that I rode it ten times in a row but we needed to wait quite a lot. I liked the part when it was so dark that you couldn't see anything, that made my feelings four times better. As I get through the dark part I saw a light, I recognized that it was the exit and at that moment.... 'Splash' I landed in the water. That caused my heart saying, ""Do it again, do it again."" So I got addicted to it. After the fun water slide, my friend was already at the spa place so I followed him. When I arrived there, I saw waters bursting from the top, when I stood there it really did the magic. My heavy shoulders were getting light but it damaged me a tiny bit. We figured out that we could go outside, when we went there we thought that we were in the maze. The water pushed us to different path and that was when I almost lost my friend but I didn't care that much. So my conclusion is to go there. At winter, you could go skiing and at summer you can go swimming. Isn't that wonderful?"
Ocean World!,"In Vivaldi park, I went to ocean world. It was BIG. The lockers was huge. Also has a sauna(hot bath)! There is lot of BIG thing you can do! I will say that the monster slide was the best! There is and wave pool that makes huge waves. It is two times bigger than YOU!So many water slides! In the winter, you can ski! I had lot of fun with my friends and i do not regret that i went to Vivaldi park! i loved it :-]"
limited english translator,"we booked a free shuttle bus through the tourist information center at Myeongdong. Since it is holiday season we had booked 3 days in advance to be able to be accomodated. As we arrive at the ski resort, we found it a not so tourist friendly...we felt at lost the moment we arrived since this is the first time we went to a ski resort. There are payment counters however, if you have several questions on how to go about your first ski experience...such as renting boots, ski, lockers...the ski personnels had a really hard time explaining thus we spent a lot of time observing other people on how and where to go...after paying you still have to get stubs then find a locker (very hard to spot an empty one). then pick up gear and so on...but after getting exhausted in looking for a locker which we eventually found one at the other building (wearing your ski shoes (heavy) to walk at the other building plus bringing your sled...took a toll out of our strength and time...but eventually we got to enjoy the basic slope for beginners!! was so happy and we really enjoyed..hopefully, the management would have a tourist lane for information and for us to enjoy the ski experience!!!"
Fun place to go once in a lifetime,Vivaldi water park was amazing experience. I have been there to participate LG Snow Festival. Had an amazing fun with friends learning Skiing and then water park slides.
Ski world with hot spring ocean park,"Vivaldi Park is very close to Seoul as a ski resort in the winter. Compare to other ski stations in Gangwon province, the quality of the snow is so, so as long as it does not snow. However, after enjoying ski or board, you can also enjoy Ocean park's spa. Some of students stay over the night in order to enjoy the morning ski session too(at Jjimjil bang). I recommend to book a room at the condo there, if you schedule to enjoy 2 consecutive days for ski. Another good point is there are free shuttles during ski season, from Seoul(major hubs like jamshil, sinchon, gwanghwamun, etc) and its satellite cities. My main reason to go quite often is the location. within an hour and half is good enough to enjoy winter sports. From in the afternoon, it starts crowded with many school boys and girls!"
For Spartan Race I visited here,"15, June, 2014 There was a race named ""Spartan Race"" at Vivaldi park.My friend and I booked a room here. And enjoyed its water park one day ahead of race date.It was good enough. But if you want wide, more equipped facilities, it may be out of your choice."
Awesome water park,"Spent 2 days here. Its expensive but was lucky enough to get in for free via a friend. Hired a cabana to use for us to rest, eat etc. Best do this with a family or two to share the cost. You MUST go early ie morning, else the lines for the big rides will be too long. But still many other rides to enjoy. A really fun ride with short waiting time is located in the indoor pool section - but tucked away in the back right corner. Its quite thrilling even for adults but safe enough for my 6yr old daughter as you simply sit on a big pink tube.There is a Burger King located inside upstairs which was a welcome sight. TIP:: bring a baseball cap or sunhat to wear while in the pools. Its compulsory. Also for most outdoor rides you will need a lifejacket, so hire one there for only 5bux if you dont have your own."
Very fun water theme park,"There are indoor and outdoor areas. The indoor area has slides, wave and wading pools, and a hot tub area. But the outdoor area is where the fun really is. There are lots of slides big and small, splash pools and hot spring pools in different colors! We had lots of fun and were sorry we could only spend an afternoon here. It does get very crowded though and there'd be queues not just for the rides but also for registration and the lockers, so best to go on a weekday and during off-peak seasons. Only downside is that the hotels there are a little old."
Very nice aqua park,"Big and full of surprises, everybody can have a good day visiting this park. Circuits are amazingly long and very adrenaline producing, this is good for famillies as well as youngs."
Amazing fun water theme park!,"We only stayed for 1 night but we thoroughly enjoyed the water park. There were so many rides to go on but be warned the queues can be long! The centre offered a lot of activities but we didn't get the chance to try them out. the threat of typhoon looming prompted us to leave early. Next time, I'll definitely spend 3nights at least. Very nice surrounds "
