Historic catholic church ,This cathedral church is historic & oldest one in Daegu. The church isn't giant & great structure inside & outside of the church such as European ones but its breathing with Daegu. The cheongla hills and seomoon market are close from it.
First Catholic Church built in Kyoungsang province of Korea.,"First Catholic Church built in Kyoungsang province of Korea. It was originally a Korean way house but it was built in a way of western style after the church was burned down in 1901. It is one of the three major Catholic Churches in Korea.  Myoungdong Church in Seoul, Jeondong Church in Jeonju, Kyesan Church in Daegu."
Daegu Gyesan Catholic Church - email address,"Hi , do you know the email address of Daegu Gyesan Catholic Church? We are organizing a pilgrimage and I tried looking for the email address in their website but I cannot find it."
Oldest Catholic Church in Daegu,Attended evening Sun mass with friend. Very solemn and calming. Organ was playing. I don't understand any Korean but enjoyed seeing people of faith worshipping. No kneeling took place during the service. 
Illuminated at night,"While you probably can't go inside if it is late, the building is lit up, making the stained glass images really stand out."
"Serene, tranquil place for worship","The only remaining structure in Daegu from the 1900s, according to visitkorea website. As catholics, this church was something we really looked forward to visiting in Korea and I'm glad we did. The church was so serene and the architecture was impressive. The church surrounding was also beautiful and green. The church can be visited via the Daegu City Tour Bus, Stop No. 5. Near the church is a big presbyterian church and a museum, which is also a great place to know more of the modern history of Daegu. Across the street was the location of the K-drama Love Rain."
Old,"Nostalgic, serene, accessible, good to be visited in Daegu. Masses at mid day. (Banwoldang station, Exit 18).Nearby: Protestant Church in Cheongna Hill"
2D1N K TRAVEL BUS 대구투어,"아주아주 이쁘다 !!! Gyesan Catholic Church was built by Priest Robert, A.P. in 1899 which was constructed with wood using a Korean-style design."
"Catholic cathedral, like many others","Nothing special, although important cathedral in the centre of Daegu. Worth paying a short visit, if you are in the area"
Beautiful interior! Lovely serene church,"Found it interesting and convenient that there was a TV in the church for those in the back who cannot see the altar and the priest. The interior is beautiful and unique to Korea. Felt at home, considering I'm a foreigner to Daegu, South Korea. "
Nice Gothic Cathedral in Daegu,"This is a nice cathedral in Daegu, near some other historical areas. It is nice and serene and quite pretty."
NICE CHURCH STRUCTURE, The church is DAEBAK!!! I find it quite pretty and very solemn. But I can see few people only.
