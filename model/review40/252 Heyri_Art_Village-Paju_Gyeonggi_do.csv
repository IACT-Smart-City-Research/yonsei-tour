VERY DIFFERENT PLACE IN KOREA,It seems quite a few of the galleries are empty these days -- at least compared to a trip I took with friends 2 years ago. Restaurants are plentiful and good. Those galleries and museums that are open offer an very eclectic array of art in various forms. If you are family with the southern California city of Laguna Beach -- it has a very similar feel. Worth the time.
Memory box,"Good atmosphere, suitable for holidays. There are many coffee shops to choose from.you can come here also"
Interesting place to visit,"The art village is about 45 minutes on the bus (number 2200) in Paju, northwest of Seoul. I went on a Tuesday and it's quiet, with few visitors. It was an overcast day (turned rainy in the afternoon), so everything was a bit grey. I had a leisurely stroll around. A number of buildings have nice modern architecture and designs, like a showcase of modern Korean architecture. There are art galleries, museums, artist studios, bookshops, cafes, restaurants, coffee/dessert/cooking/chocolate workshops, etc. On this visit, I checked out the Hangil Book House, the White Block Art Centre, a jewellery gallery, a music studio, and had coffee and cake at a cake studio. There are cafes everywhere, so it's quite handy. It is an interesting place to visit, a nice day out, in particular if you like architecture and design, coffee, and when the weather is good."
Interesting Artsy Village,"Heyri Art Valley is is less than an hour northwest and was the vision of a book publisher many years ago. The inhabitants of Heyri Art Valley are mostly Korean artists such as writers, painters, actors, architects and musicians. Due to the artistic nature of the community, there are residences, workrooms, art galleries and museums, all of which are owned and operated by the artists themselves. In addition, there are also cafes and food courts for the convenience of visitors. We were there in the evening and most of the museums were about to close. So instead of taking the shuttle tour of the village, or visit a museum, we had wanted to just walk around and absorb the artsy vibes of the village.Unfortunately for us, the weather was pretty cold (and it was pretty dark), so we changed our minds and hopped back to the car to drive around to look for some nice café to chill. We finally settled on this book café which had shelves upon shelves of books. It was called Foresta Book Café. From the moment we entered, it was as if we were magically transported into a different world. The café has a bookstore and a museum within its premises. The café is on the first floor and has floor-to-ceiling shelves full of enormous collections of books, vast spaces with tables and chairs and aesthetics that book lovers would drool over.Definitely worth the visit the next time we are in Seoul (for really nice photos and atmosphere), there are still so many places we did not get to explore. For more on the experience and photos, please check out my blog. ^^"
Interesting place to visit,"Had a lovely morning here . Had a late breakfast at a bakery/cafe. Then a leisurely stroll around the shops, musuems and art galleries.Webt to the Time and Blade musuem, extensive collection of clocks, watches swords and knives from all around the world and different time frames. Had lunch at a quirky Korean restaurant where you shake your food in a hot tin to mix it up and blood sausage. Tasty! Book cafe well set out."
Artistic stuff in the cafe ,"Initially thought it’s an art village though they have some 3D and some art outside. Most of it are cafes here, where they have some parts of it to allow people to appreciate art in their cafe. But it’s quiet on a Friday. Good to spend time away from crowds if you like coffee and art. "
Napkin art and miniature place ,What more can I say. All 3 of our children said this was the best part of the entire trip to Korea. And we were here for 4 weeks. 
Quirky - not typical tourist location ,"A very wet day brought about a change of plans & we ended up spending Sat. in this Art Village. It contains a hodgepotch of buildings (some odd looking ones) with different exhibits. In spite of the weather, there were lots of cars. These were probably people eating at the many food outlets rather than art enthusiasts. We visited exhibits with 3D art, musical instruments, jewellery, wood craft & pottery. In most of these places, we were the only people there. It should be even quieter on weekdays. As it’s about an hour’s drive north of Seoul, I would not put this place high on a tourist itinerary unless you like quirky architecture. "
Don't go there in Winter!,There is nothing there except few cafe. Buildings are normal and not like web site described. It was freezing cold in Jan and I cannot see any interesting thing there.
"Interesting, but quiet","We went to this village from Ilsan on Tuesday afternoon, by taxi. It was about 20000 won taxi fare.The most interesting attraction to us, was the Museum of Modern History of Korea, located just at Gate 4. If you are middle age people, or even younger.. you would find this museum interesting.For us, it was like we went back to our childhood, with things and life styles in the past, around 1930(?) to the end of millennium. Brought back the memories, and eventhough we are from overseas, the lifestyle was approximately the same. Just like back to the past.The other attractions was quiet, not many visitors. It was like ""deserted""; may be it would be more people in week ends?.The public transportation was only bus, no taxi stands,"
Shipping ,Here nice place you must to visit It the most interesting arts cultures Special African beautiful arts were amazing With much nice restaurant caffe shops And so on. So many traditionally things 
Disappointing,"Read from blogs and reviews that Heyri was an area of museums, but it was more like galleries, cafes & restaurants. My friend and I took bus 2200 from Hapjeong station exit 1, to Heyri Village exit 4 (bus ride is about 40mins). Guides and tour bus drivers spoke in Korean, and there was minimal English translation/explanations available in the galleries, even at the ticketing booth. Perhaps because of the language barrier, my friend and I found ourselves bored after some time as we could not understand much. Overall, it was a rather disappointing place for us. "
Interesting place,"Be in South Korea was a good experience for me, I have the opportunity to visit to many places in Seoul, but after few days walking in the big city we decide to stay in Paju and visit the art village, they have small stores with to many souvenir and artists paints, a nic little restaurants and cafes, was very relaxing and very interesting to expend a day in the art village"
Nice day trip!,"Decided to go somewhere away from the usual Seoul attractions as it was my 4th trip to Korea.Went straight from Incheon airport by train to Hapjeong station. From there Bus 2200 took us past the book city and outlet mall. There was a bit of difficulty identifying the correct bus stop as the bus announcements were mainly in Korean. We ended up stopping one bus stop too early but the walk was not far. Entered through one of the gates and tried to get directions but very little was available in English. However, the lady at the counter was friendly enough and recommended us to buy tickets for the Museum of Modern History of Korea and Norang Museum. She put us on the Dona Dona bus after giving us a wrist band, map and receipt and through the rest of the day, the bus drivers were looking out for us to pick us up and to drive us to different spots. One even, with his limited English, gave us a tour around the village and showed us what he thought were interesting places visit.Very picturesque, and if you are a KD fan, you may recognize spots where the dramas were filmed. Some stores were closed on Friday when we visited.Definitely worth at least half a day. "
Artistic Building Structures,"I'm quite impressed with the artistic building structures. It's nice to view them and take pictures. It's not like you're in Korea :) I noticed there are a lot of cafes rather than restaurants there are some clothing and accessories shops inside too.Because I'm a Korean drama addict, I enjoyed Farmer's Table Restaurant (near Exit 4). This is one of the filming sites in Boys Over Flowers. It is their luxurious canteen inside the school. Downstairs is like a kiddie trick eye museum. Entrance is only 5000 Won. There were a lot of people when we went there probably because it was Sunday.Mostly families with their kids and grandparents.I also noticed it doesn't have much of English translations but the staff there are very accommodating and some can speak and understand English too. If you want to see the whole village I suggest you take the mini electronic car from Exit 4 so you can see all of it. We regret not trying it. LOL I think it's only 5000 Won.The bus you rode from Hapjeong has a stop to Exit 4 after Exit 1.I pretty much enjoyed it but will not probably go back though It's worth a visit if you are in Paju. :)"
Inspiring Place,"We loved visiting this place, and found it really inspirational! Could totally see ourselves living and working there. Act"
One of my favourite places in Korea,"A place for couples to have a romantic date or any exhausted Seoulite that wants to recreate a bit. Heyri is a small 'village' in the close proximity of Paju city that offers various things to do and see, museums, galleries, romantic restaurants and cafes, quirky architecture. Some may call it an art village but don't expect art in the form of high culture, so you can avoid disappointment. I wouldn't suggest art lovers to visit here for the art; it's not a challenging place, it's a feel good place. It's a place to have a comfortable promenade in a nice surrounding, to break out from the bustling everydays of Seoul. My favourite places I've seen here so far: Museum of Modern History of Korea, currency museum, toy museum, restaurant in a bridal salon. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because most attractions are closed down now and it's not well maintained."
A little art village,"We stopped by the village after a visit to the DMZ. Nothing stand out to be very extraordinary except that it is one of the location of filming of ""My love from the star"".We spent maybe half an hour just to walk about."
for the art enthusiasts,"I went here during the winter season seeing some snow remains. It's so nice to walk around to appreciate the houses, cafes, structures and the arts all over the village. It's an hour bus ride from Seoul, just take the bus 2200 to get here."
Tourist trap,During our visit we didn't discover any real art. Most of the shops sell cheap souvenirs. The village is overcrowded with parked cars. It's a weird posh Asian place. I wouldn't recommend going there.
Arty Farty Hangout,Love this place with its unique museums and cafes. Wear comfortable shoes for a nice stroll around this area.
Modern village,"The theme of this village built in modern style , if you an artist or architect you ll enjoys the atmosphare around, Its quite place with very friendly people, With lot of well designed cafes, restaurants, galleries and museums.Great for relaxation and clear the mind from cities. "
Beautiful architecture and museums,"I visited this place on a Tuesday. Managed to avoid the crowd. However I realised not many places were opened. Conversed with a cafe owner who explained to me that most of their museums were closed on Mon-Tues. Good to visit this place on Wed-Sun. Map provided by the tourist information booth is only available in Korean. However staff was very helpful. Back to Cafe lady at Books Cafe -she was very helpful and showed me where to explore and popular sights and buildings to visit. I'll return again to do this. Remember to wear comfortable walking shoes. Be prepared to spend 4-6 hours here. Bus ride from Seoul takes about 40-60mins. Take bus 2200 from bus stop no. 1 from Hapjeong station exit 2 - note that they have relocated the bus stop which is not far away from the previous bus stop. Bus also goes the premium outlets so if you are bored, do pop by to shop. Sit on the left of the bus to locate some sights of DMZ zone. In all, Hyeri art village is a must visit. "
Just to visit for one time,"I past the place a few times when commuting for work and we decided to try a visit.Most shops sell soap, scent or coffee. As said, for a one time visit it's OK but I'm not sure if we may go back.The underground shopping area has a few shops we liked and the restaurant/bakery on top of 'Maison Objet' makes good pizza. "
A nice little town inside of Paju,"You can walk around for a while. There are mostly restaurants. But it's nice to go for a walk anyways.There are also some art shops and wineries. Things there aren's expensive, but not cheap either."
Enjoyable for a one time experience,"First, I really enjoyed certain aspects of Hyeri (correct spelling) Art Village. My fiancé and I found an excellent Vietnamese restaurant that had good food. Was it worth the price? Not completely but the food was above average, it was a touristy area and she enjoyed it. Therefore I had no problem paying a little more for good food. The other aspect was the Concrete Cafe. The owner was very nice and there was a cat there that the owner had. We played with it and the cafe was very quiet and had a nice atmosphere of artwork and books. I could easily study there if I lived in Paju.Unfortunately, there's the other side of Hyeri Art Village which was frustrating. If you want to visit a museum and see its artwork, you'll have to pay for it. And not only do you have to pay, but you have to pay a pretty penny (W6,000-10,000). There was a small jewelry shop which you would expect to be free just to look inside. Nope. You had to pay W5,000 just to browse a shop that would take less than 10-15 minutes to browse in. We quickly walked out and moved on.So what did my fiancé and I do after that? We took pictures of the surrounding areas including English Village and then took a bus to the Lotte Premium Outlet and did some shopping. Would I go back to Hyeri Art Village? Not likely. I loved the serenity of nature but I think I could do that while hiking or going to Chuncheon and get a better value out of it. Having to pay admission prices for a tiny room of artwork makes this place a tourist trap."
Lovely day out,"We took a bus from Hapjeong station. It can be a little confusing where to alight as there are 2 bus stops that are along the village. I recommend getting off at the 2nd bus stop as there are more amenities such as restaurants and cafes etc. The place is pretty big so if you can rent a bicycle, that would be better else you can take a nice long stroll. There are many cafes and restaurants around the village, and different museums such as Korean folk history, watch and swords, movies etc. Do budget more time for a leisurely exploration. I highly recommend this for something different from the usual Seoul sights."
Culture tripping," This is an artist heaven! And a coffee lovers delight. There as many museums, shops and cafe around this large place that you can spend half of the day! Museum overload. Although some of the museums require an entrance fee ranging from 6 won. A bit pricy considering the museums and grand palaces in seoul cost 1-3 won only. There is a ticket booth that sells for packaged tours. Sorry wasn't able to read it.  Restaurants are plenty in this place. But what is obvious is their love of coffee! Cafe in every corner! "
Sampler day trip,"Easy journey from Seoul to Paju. Fantastic place to spend a day there looking at works of artists and displays in various ""houses"" like set up. If you arrive earlier in the day, do buy special combination tickets for entry to the various museums or pottery; ceramic making classes. One may go to the Korean Modern Days museum and the Alive Museum and other galleries for some fun taking pictures.. Best to avoid weekends but then, only during weekends you get to see more events taking place. On a weekday, you get more peace walking around with lesser crowd. Have fun venturing and coffee places plenty there"
Interesting walk,It can be reached by public transport using bus 2200 from Hapjeong station. There are a lot of restaurants in the area. A walk around allows one to see different works and interpretations of art. Good place for taking pictures.
"Leisurely place for a walk, coffee and art","If you enjoy spending leisurely time walking about and getting a little lost in the large walkable Heyri Art Village, if you like visit interesting cafe with different character and concepts, if you enjoy the occasional surprise here and there, then this is the place for you. Hang loose, chill out and enjoy."
A must-see when you visit Heyri :-),What and how Korea was -- before all the advanced technology and fast-paced lifestyle. This museum showcases Korea before and after the Korean war.
Heyri art village when art meet fun,"the place is so huge, nice for taking a photograph, peaceful, place to escape from the hustle bustle seoul, the air so fresh and the bulding were nicely built, lot of museum and cafe with their own theme. You also can choose the experience activity like korean pottery making, korean rice wine making, korean food cooking activities, bread making, clothes designing, korean traditional music learning."
disappointing!,"We visited here on ouy way back to Seoul from the DMZ and were quiet disapoointed with the art village. there is more in the museum rather than on the streets of the village. there are plenty of nice, cozy cafes but very very overpriced. i beleive its good for small children otherwise definately not worth it."
Lovely Art Village,"I love Heyri's fancy museums , cafes and nice restaurants.A real eye opener. Will definitely visit again and spend a longer time as lots of walking to do."
Beautiful art village,"This is a very nice place with many workshops and nice ambience, lakes were frozen, there have very nice shabby decoration around like London bus and stray cats around, I enjoy strolling around taking shots in hidden lanes and beautiful workshop interior despite the very cold weather.Skip this place to avoid disappointment if you are not an adventurous person and loath walking as this is a very big place and from workshop to workshop it needs few mins walking.If you are an art and craft person and photo taking traveler, you will love this place."
Cosy cafes and fancy musuems,"I have visited Heyri Art village several times. It is really good place to relax and to have fun during one day. Actually, it is the village that artists are gathered and live together, but there are a group of cosy cafes, nice restaurants, and fancy museums."
Beautiful boutique cafes and galleries,"Visited the book cafe, levels and levels of books! And also really really enjoy the classical music cafe! The cafe is set up with great acoustics and LPs of classical music (you can request also) and just sitting there was amazing. When I walked in I was looking for the violinist because it sounded live! Make sure to check it out when you're there."
Art Valley for Art Lover,"It's quite a big area for this village. There are a lot of studios and museums. The main gate is Gate # 4, go straight and you will see coffee shop, gallery and museum - Alive Museum (Trick Art Museum)."
"art, archtecture and cafe","If you are bored and annoyed by all the crowds and shopping, here is a great choice to relax. not much ppl, easy to go to (just take a bus and get off at the right stop, no need to change), you can find a lot of artistic cafe for you just sit down and relax, but the place is a bit big for walking if you need to see all buildings, make sure which one you want to go and choose the right route."
The Farmers Table,We got to Heyri Art Village after 5 PM and the studios and galleries were closed. There was still a lot of food stands open as well as make and take art places. A lot of little kids were enjoying zooming around in little electric rental cars. We were hungry and lucked into a great dining experience at a farm to table restaurant called appropriately enough Farmers Table. The caprese salad was the best I have ever eaten. The bread was good and straight from the oven. The spaghetti carbona had a thinner sauce than normal but tasted great. The house wine was also good. The decor and service was really great and it had very nice clean restrooms. All in all a great experience and definitely worth a return visit. The food was moderately price especially for Korea where prices are high.
Nice day trip,"We took off from Incheon by car and after an hour drive, arrived shortly before lunch time. Even though it was a saturday, the place wasn't crowded at that time. We decided to have lunch first and I was surprised that there were cheap options available. Several restaurants serving Korean and Western food as well as lots of coffee shops. We had noodle soup 6000Krw, Korean dumplings 5000Krw and pork cutlet 6-8000Krw.After lunch we left the kids at a playground that was 20000Krw per child. That price includes activities such as cooking and crafting. Lots of museums but you have to pay for each. We went to the one that showed how Koreans lived in the past-1950's-1980's. 7000krw per person. Well worth it, maybe 45minutes to go through with lots of items to look at. They also built replicas of old shops and houses. I also wanted to see the coin and paper money museum, 3000Krw entrance fee but wifey didn't want.After the kids finished, they wanted to paint pottery. You can make your own cups/bowls or you paint already made cups, plates etc. After you are done, the shop will bake them and ship them to your house. It takes 4 weeks to arrive. Prices start from 15000Krw for a cup."
A nice day trip,"Heyri Village in Paju is a nice day trip for couples, friends or families. On first look, it seems spectacular. A 'village' full of museums, coffee shops, bistros. While it is nice - no doubt about that, I found it overall to be less than what I expected. The museums were small and expensive. The food was just okay. The park itself was well maintained in some areas, and completely forgotten, overgrown, and trashed in other areas. And what is the deal with the apparent lack of garbage cans? It's a nice place, don't get me wrong, but it can easily be better. It's a nice place to stroll through, as well, and just enjoy a beautiful day. Stop by nearby Little Provence and make a day trip out of it."
Nice art installations--best to go with a friend,"I think that getting there by bus was not inconvenient at all. You just hitch a bus (I cannot remember the numbers anymore) from Hapjeong station, and it takes about 1 hour or so to reach the Heyri Art Park. The park has various gates of entry, from 1 to 8 or so, and entering via each one gives you a chance to walk around various quarters of the Art Park. On the whole, I enjoyed taking photographs of the art installations, but as for parts like the museums and so on, it is better to go with a friend or family because you enjoy yourself more by taking pictures around those 'trick-eye' type of pictures."
Fun place to be,"Lot of Museums, good food and retro of the South Korea's history. Simple fares and coffee. Do not expect any high end stuff here. More of a day of fun. Two words to sum it up : Old School"
Truly an escape to an art world,"Lots of great museums, restaurants and a very interesting old museum to see. Houses in the village are so modern and have their own stores. Souvenir shops and very near Provence and paju outlet stores"
Nice day trip from Seoul,"While on a short visit to Seoul, went here with my family for a day trip. It was a nice place to walk around and see some eclectic art work and get a light snack and coffee. Don't expect much in the way of high end cuisine and a visit here is really best on a nice weather day."
Various experience and many museum.,"CYC ( 2013.11.03 ) There was a village with many museum and experience place. There was a good place for walking a day with no definite idea. Many building had own distinct charaterishtic, and various experience activity could. But this village left a little to be desired, in village too many cars, and bicycle. I think, there would be a good place if without car, bicycle."
Weird and Wonderful Place off the Beaten Track!!!,"I had heard whispers about this place from a couple of friends who were based in art studios up in Heyri and it sounded like a bizarre and interesting place to visit so I was desperate to check it out during my stay in S.Korea. It was early June when we headed there so the weather was just starting to turn toasty, although not uncomfortably hot and there were plenty of places to grab refreshments so we picked a nice day for it! I didn't know a great deal about the place and the info available in English online was somewhat limited but I had a vague idea of what this village was about so it was a kind of turn up and see how it pans out situation.Getting there was not too tricky although I was glad I had a friend with me who was able to decipher a bit of hangul which was a reassurance when travelling out of town and not being able to speak the lingo! We opted to take the express 2200 bus from Exit 2 of Hapjeong Station~ the bus stop is right at the top of the stairs when you come out and there is both an express and slower service with the difference being 40 mins versus an hour and a half. Bus was rammed full and we found all of the stops to be written in Korean so it was vital to keep an eye out (once you get to Paju with it's small cluster of shops/ cafes etc then keep a lookout for the entrance to Heyri by the roadside a few minutes later and this is where you want to hop off the bus!!) It's an interesting ride up to Paju as you creep closer and closer to the N/S Korean border as there is more military presence and an abundance of barbed wire~ the whole atmosphere of the place shifts as soon as you live the neon jungle of Seoul and find yourself in the countryside and so eerily close to the DMZ so it makes an interesting trip out of town and a chance to see another aspect of Korea.When we arrived there were no maps available and no English guide so we freestyled it and just took to wandering around. There are a tonne of little galleries, art studios, workshops that you can participate in and endless eateries, cafes and snack stalls. The place has a carnival meets commune type of feel~ it was like no other place I have ever been to in my life. There were conceptual white walled galleries dotted with the sporadic piece of contemporary art sitting next to a sparkling Aladdin's cave full of vintage toys and trashy trinkets so it's really a mixed bag over there! There is a toy museum, Trick Eye gallery, installations around the site...something for everyone! Galleries each come with an individual entrance fee so whilst entry into the actually Heyri complex is free, expect to pay for each gallery or exhibition which tended to be around the 6000 won mark.There are some really cool cafes in the art village ranging from an awesome book cafe lined floor to ceiling with colourful tomes and a scrumptious pizza joint housed in a snazzy bit of architecture! We opted for some pizza action in 'Cafe Between' which was lovely and came in at around 15- 20,000 won per pizza~ was so happy to find some vegetarian options all this way out in the Korean countryside and they also serve sandwiches, salads etc!!! There are plenty of places to grab coffee and cake so it's worth taking a stroll around and seeing what delightful cafe you can find out your way! We had the best ever strawberry shortcake in the cute Toy Museum cafe!!!! There is a section in the centre that has kiosks selling fast food including hot dogs, BBQ, ice creams and the most glorious patbingsu that I have ever eaten that even came topped with cornflakes!I just adored this place~ it was weird and wonderful with something strange and unexpected around every corner! Fibreglass cartoon statues, amazing sculptures, contemporary art, candyfloss, surrounded by bright green mountains and beautiful Korean countryside...even a random novelty mushroom perched on top of a building!! So bizarre and magical!!!Overall it was a really great day out~ Heyri is such an obscure and one of a kind place that will appeal to all from families, to art lovers, tourists, adventurers, foodies and people looking to stray from the usual trail so it makes a really fun trip out of town. I would definitely recommend that you put this place on your list as it was a fantastic experience and and interesting spot to check out!"
Nice Weekend Getaway,"A friend and I made the way to Paju from Seoul for a weekend gateaway. Seoul's weather in July was terrible - hot and wet! Heyri Art Valley was surprisingly a respite from the heat although it also drizzled several times on the Saturday we visited. It was easy enough getting to Heyri Art Valley from Seoul as it involved a bus ride that takes under 1 hour. We booked an overnight accommodation at Hotel Wiz and got terribly lost trying to find the hotel but that's a separate review.When we got to Heyri Art Valley around noon, it was rather quiet and pleasantly cool. We enjoyed the walk around the village admiring interesting architecture of the buildings. And when we got tired or wanted to chill, there were numerous cafes to step into. My favourite must be Foresta, a book cafe.The local crowd with their cars started coming in by mid-afternoon where it got crowded and by evening time, every single parking lot was occupied. Thankfully by then, we were ready to return to our hotel after an early dinner."
Nice but.....,Not a good idea to visit during the hot and wet months unless you can take the heat and humidity as you need to walk (quite a lot!) from 1 gallery to another in the sun and sometimes rain. Otherwise it's a good place for art lovers and to chill out in the cool cafes.
Artsy Fartsy in a cute way.,"Besides the fact that it takes 1 and half hour to get there, everything there is wonderful. food was kinda pricey but when you're in the mood its all good. "
Good place for a day,"Its a nice place to visit for a day. Famous for restaurants and coffee shops, look up the list in the internet before you go. A nice day course would be Heyri Village followed by a visit to the Paju Premium Outlets for cheap shopping."
art village,It's far from Seoul (about 1.5 hour distance) but worth to visit
Great Potential,"Ever since my daughter moved to Paju to teach there, I've been threatening to visit, and I finally got around to it this last weekend. After discussing the merits of various attractions, we decided to visit the art village.First of all, it's a long way from where she is, Geumchon, to the village, so if you take a taxi be prepared to fork over about 8000won. Best would be to head to a subway station closer to it - but as for which one, I'd be unable to advise.Having been to the ceramics village near Ichon, I was expecting something similar - a colony of artists all living together and working and selling what they produce to the public. Instead we found a number of houses still under construction, a lot of museums, each charging and entrance fee in the 6000 to 10000 won range, and a section that has been thoroughly commercialized - lots of upmarket and upscale restaurants, some take-away eateries and knick-knack sellers.It seemed that we chose a bad day to visit, as the previous day had seen many workshops and events, so my perceptions are based on what we experienced on a Sunday. I was very disappointed that there was literally no shop where art was on display, or where an artist was working at his or her craft.I was also not impressed by having to fork out for each museum visit. Since the layout is such that there are two main entrances, I would have preferred a flat fee at the entrance and then access to such attractions as were available."
Heyri Art Valley - Museum of Modern history of Korea,"This place is consisted of many personal collections' builidings. The owners of each buildings are maniac to music, history, comic books, sculpture, etc. Close to DMZ area, so it is good to make one day trip with DMZ and ""Paju Provence"" - this is name of place, too. Even if Heyri has many spots to look around, I personally admire one spot, ""Museum of Modern history of Korea"". You can enjoy Korea from 1940's up to now. According to coordinator, I became quite regular with this museum, the owner collect whole items of the museum. Those items are from the real time. You can be witness of poor Korea 1940's and of glory Korea of 2002, worldcup. It is very nostalgic and wonderful place.http://www.heyri.net/blog/http://www.kmhm.or.kr/"
An art preservatory,Wish there were more places like this in the world. Here in this village they preserve the old traditional art methods and develop for the younger ones. There are lots of art cafes and restaurants to choose but the most important is we were living in a pure art atmosphere.
Art village is extraordinarily interesting,"Heyri is extraordinarily interesting and well worth the trouble of getting there. The Tour to Korea web site has information about how to get there if you don’t have a car. It’s a newish township where a wide variety of artists have built studios and homes, and there are several cafes and restaurants- in a range of pricing. The gallery of each artist has art works on display, many of which are wonderfully captivating although the quality does vary. Many items are for sale. The architectural design of each of the buildings is also a feature of the village, as is the landscape setting. Plenty of opportunity to wander around and visit different artists’ works. There is a more commercial centre on the north edge near the bus stop. On the weekend it can be altogether too busy so a weekday visit is better. I don’t know of any place to stay overnight in the village."
