Hidden in plain sight ,"This was my first time eating budaejjigae, and it was excellent. I'm glad there was another customer who spoke English, because the restaurant workers did not."
DELICIOUS,"Heard about this place being famous for their budaejiggae -- I had never previously been a fan of spicy food, but this was delicious. There was countless restaurants to choose from. The atmosphere was very authentic and cool. If you are in Uijeongbu -- definitely stop by this street!"
Delicious,"Uijeongbu is famous for 부대찌개. I went to one of the famous 부대찌개 restaurants with my boyfriend for lunch. The taste is really good. The price is also quite affordable, which is about 10,000 won or less per person (if I am not wrong). Must try 부대찌개 if you are nearby Uijeongbu station."
