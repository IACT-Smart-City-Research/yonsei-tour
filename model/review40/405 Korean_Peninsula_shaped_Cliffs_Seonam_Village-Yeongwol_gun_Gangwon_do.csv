Worth a Quick visit.,This is another example of Mothet Nature creating something natural and humans making a tourist attraction out of it.I wouldn't recommend drivng 100 kms out of your way but if you are in the area its definitely worth a look.There is plenty of parking.A small parking fee.Then 15-30 minute easy walk to the viewing platform.
Good short hike to the cliff,Itâ€™s a short 15 minute hike to the cliff from the parking lot. Nice trail walk and you have vendors around the parking lot selling local delicacies and drink for your post-hike rehydration.
Nice walk of about 2 km,"The parking lot is about 1 km from the main viewpoint. The walk is winding through the forrest - you can make it a round trip of slightly more than 2 km and get a few extra vistapoints over the river. There were sticks that you can borrow at the start of the hike. The viewpoint is, as the picture suggests fairly high over the river so that you can see the opposite peninsula well."
