fun-filled activity,"I really enjoyed this activity, a good way to break away from urban living and experience a different kind of activity. Each tunnel has different attractions that you can look forward too, everytime you pass the tunnel."
For a fun filled adventure ,"We visited Gangchon Rail Park as it was part of our tour package that we bought on Klook. Went by tour as we were unsure on how to get here by public transport as I googled it and it looked pretty complicated. Even though it was sunny when we went, it was still cold about 0 degrees, and even though you will be doing most of the cycling, please ensure that you are warm enough as it can be quite windy when you are cycling through the tunnels. 10/10 for the amazing views while cycling and would recommend renting the VR goggles for the last tunnel. After the ride, you will have to take a train back. The train is called a “Romantic Train” although nothing romantic about squeezing in the indoor train cabin. It was probably because it was too cold to be in the outdoor cabin. "
Funny experience!,"It’s far away from town, we joined a local tour that included the transportation. The scenery is spectacular all the way, even in tunnels , there’re decorations! "
Chasing the sunset with our rail bikes,Booked the last slot at 530pm which was great because we could catch the beautiful sunset as we cycled past the route. Passed through various music themed tunnels from classic to romantic to dance pop which livened up the 40 mins route before we took the mega red train back. Easy activity even for the not so fit as you don’t actually have to cycle a lot. There is a engine that helps to keep it moving most of the time. 
New experience out of seoul,Was part of nami island tour package. We took 2 seater and went in oct. Remember to wear thick jacket and go to the toilet before the ride as the weather is quite cold during late noon time. Will recommand this for couple and familyAnyone know what is the song name in the light tunnel?
Fun experience!,This place is part of the itinerary for our day tour after Nami Island. The ride was pretty easy as most of it was downhill. The scenery was beautiful and passed through themed tunnels.
Probably the highlight of my while Korean trip!,The ride was easy and the view was wonderful. Whole experience was awesome and really enjoyed the whole tour with my family
"Pretty view , amazing experience. ",Good weather in september 18th... we took 4 seater bike... pretty view .. you must try this... in finish line you can buy your photo including frame for 10.000 won... 
Very fun activity with friends,"It was a fun activity and a new experience to bike along an abandoned railway, such a good use. The bikes were comfortable and the views were stunning, and the tunnels were very nice to see as well. It was a bit of a workout especially on the uphill climbs but it was not too bad, very manageable. Recommended for group of friends and families but not if you’re traveling with little children or seniors, as you might have to pedal for them, and it was not a quick ride. "
"Fun, relaxing with a bit of exercise.","This place always gets crowded with visitors so it recommended to book ahead or be early in this attraction. We got this ride as a part of our tour package (on sale via airasia activities and Ktourstory).The Rail bike runs on an old rail tracks in the area. The seating capacity is 4 so if you are only 1 or 2, you may be sharing the ride to other guests.There is a photospot before the entrance to the tunnel, make sure you spot it and smile at the camera to be able to get a good souvenir picture at the end of the trail. Purchasing the souvenir picture is optional but the photo quality is good tho.The tunnels are decorated with bubbles, stars and lights for enjoyment.The whole area is so scenic with the river and the vegetation, it really does make you feel relaxing in a rural country side of Korea.And make sure you don't run too fast or too slow since there are other bikes ahead or following you.We just loved the place, even the small waterfalls at the resting area and the train ride going to the exit. Loved this trip.BTW, recommended for all ages."
Great family activity. Fun with great scenery and exercise to boot,"Gangchon rail park is basically riding 2 seater or 4 seater rail cars by pedal power along an approximately 20-minute ride along a scenic route along the upper tributary of the Han river.The route is nice and scenic, can be very peaceful.You also go through 3 tunnels which are specially setup with lights, music to add a little spice and interest along the way (with VR on the last tunnel)Kids loved the trip and lots of scenic countryside picture opportunities (you cannot get off the bike in the middle).The park runs in intervals so you book for a specific time and a whole bunch of (individual) cars run in that group, so you will likely have a car in front and behind you.There is also a picture taking near the start of the run which is similar to other theme park rides which takes a picture and at the end of the run, there is a stall which shows the picture and lets us purchase a copy in a frame (remember to smile)At the end of the run, there is another train which will take you to the final destination P.S. At the start of the rail park there is a mini Zip Line activity which is suitable for small kids, not too expensive (10,000 Won for 2 trips - there and back), something the kids loved too."
Great scenery but rather short,"We started early in the morning on a 4 seater. It was a good day out in the open, fresh air and great scenery. There where 5 tunnels each with its own theme. The last one was the one with the VR. The kids had the VR - think can do without. Mostly downslope but getting stuck behind slower carts is a bit of a pain. Found it too short. "
Fun Ride on old rail way tracks,"Before your ride, I recommend trying the restaurants just outside entrance of the rail park . They serve a very sumptuous chicken dish. We encountered a large crowd queuing at the entrance of the ride. But once we started we had a good time.It's a fun experience pedalling over old rail way lines. The ride brings you pass small farms with vegetable plots, the rail way lines follows the banks of a scenic river. There were 3 tunnels. Going into the tunnels were fun, it's like going into a disco with loud music, flashing lights and bubbles blowing at you. Generally it was a easy ride with down slopes and flat runs most of the way. "
Country Rail Park Fun,"Bicycle pedaled carts on rails?! Up to 4 people in a cart which is pedal-powered by its riders. Most of the trek was either down hill or level through the beautiful country-side. Pedal through 2 or 3 dark tunnels, each uniquely themed with lights or bubbles.Although, located 1 1/2 hours from Seoul, I’d recommend this activity. "
Rail bike experience,"Took a package to the Nami island and La Petite and came upon this rail biking exercise at Gangchon Rail park. It is a 8 km rail track where one needs to cycle on the rail where the whole duration takes about 1h 20 min. You will go through three tunnels, first tunnel is a happy tunnel with bubbles blowing at you, second tunnel with music and the third one is a VR where you need to purchase additional 3000 won to experience the effects. You get to see the beautiful scenery as you work hard on pedaling the bike. Just make sure not to drop your phone on the track though. It has been a fun activity."
Very Trippy,"Can’t believe that too many copies of this experience exist. You get a peddle car for 2 or for 4 and you set off as part of group of cars. Very peaceful along the farmland except for the rumbling of the cars on the rails. Going through the 3 tunnels along the way was very trippy, each with a theme. Our KKDay bus was waiting a the end for us."
Exercise and Relaxation,"A rail bike trail through a very scenic location with lots of greenery and fresh air. A very fun bonding experience with the missus. They have themed tunnels (bubble, starry, Techno) which I enjoyed although I did wonder about the ajusshi and ajummas in the car ahead of us when we entered the EDM tunnel lol. Overall very fun."
Fun adventure and great workout,"This is one of the highlights of our vacation. As a family we were able to bond due to the fact that we were able to paddle the bike as a family of four through beautiful terrains and entertaining tunnels (yes they have bubbles and music in the tunnels). Try to enjoy this ride on a sunny day and don’t forget to smile when the camera takes a picture of you. Stop by the souvenir shop for the printed picture and glass frame for 10000 won, and I guarantee it’s money well spent on a beautiful souvenir. Afterwards enjoy the ride on the romantic train, but it’s basically only a ride on a train that’s filled up with benches. Overall. it’s an amazing experience for the whole family"
Worth it To Try,"We enjoy beautiful scenery along the way. The journey take 40 minutes for ride, 20 minutes rest and 20 minutes by romantic train to ganchon old station. We love it. "
Must do,Pick the 4 seater so that you can take turns pedalling. The lines may be long but they move really fast so dont worry. Dont bring any bulky bags because there won't be any space for it. You can bring food and water. Your departure point is different from your arrival point so plan accordingly. Took the klook tour together with nami island and garden of morning calm.
Surprisingly Good,"We had a 4 seater and a 2 seater bike costing 56,000won after discount. I have to say the bike ride was very fun and enjoyable regardless of age from young to old. While we get to enjoy the scenic views along the track, there were also tunnels which we will ride through which really surprise us and made us look forward to seeing and experiencing what was inside the tunnel prior to every entrance. Greatly recommend to try."
Memorable experience along Bukhanggang river,Very fun and enjoyable rail bike experience. You get to enjoy nice breeze and scenic views of the river at your own pace.
Surprisingly Good,"This was my last stop for the day after visiting nami island and I’ve to say it was really an interesting one. Weather was great other then the occasional flies getting in the way, the view was surprisingly amazing. Really enjoyed the entire ride esp with the different themed tunnels that added that extra fun element. "
Great way to spend an hour or so.,A little expensive if you are alone as it costs 13000 per car.A two seater or a 4 seater which you pay more for.Peddling was easy as it was mostly downhill.Because so many people are on it you are constantly slowing down as you catch up with the person in front.You go through a few tunnels.some with music and lights.At the end you catch a train which takes you to a place where a shuttle bus takes you back to Gimyujeong Station where your car would be.All included in price.
Nice but not amazing,"Good queue system.Bikes were easy enough for use.Had a four seater bike.The tracks of 8km were not downhill all the way. I remembered paddling hard for half the time. This means sweating in 10 degree weather with my jacket unzipped.Scenery was nice. But simply not amazing. Nothing breathtaking. Nice means nice.. Amazing to me would be niagara falls. This? A local knoll with a local river. Normal. Nice. Nothing bad about it.3 tunnels had themes to them. Was cool. After returning your bike, wait for the shuttle train to fetch all customers to main road. Then need to walk again for about 10 mins to the shuttle bus back to start point.Would i do it again? No. Once is enough. Tks."
Bad time to visit,"Easy enough ride for people of any age or fitness level. Mostly downgrade. Tunnels were cute with bubbles and sparkling lights. Final tunnel was too loud with flashing lights but teenagers in front of us seemed to enjoy. First week in April, sunny but still too cold. No color on any of the trees, ground still brown. Better to come in the autumn I've heard. Return train was crowded. Get a spot on the right side of the train, better views of the river. "
"Gangchon Rail Park - Good bicycle ride, good exercise for the the family","Rent a bicycle built for two and embark on a ride that takes you through a series of unused railway track that offers breath taking views of the farms, lakes and mountains along the railway track."
Stunning view,One of my favourite part while travelling in South Korea is the rail bike. If you are the type of person who loves nature then this activity must be in your to do list in Korea. The view are beyond amazing! 
Wonderful Experience with Toddler!,"We were still apprehensive whether to ride the rail bike with a 16 month old toddler. But since we were at Nami Island (nearby), must as well! It turns out to be an awesome experience for a first timer like us! The tunnels were interesting, the autumn scenery breathtaking. It's also slow and safe enough for us to babywear or sit our toddler on our lap. For more words, photos and video about our experience, search keywords: ""joogostyle gangchon rail bike review"""
countryside,"other than the typical railway cycling where you will be able to witness the beauty of the countryside, there is also VR cycling which is different from most places."
Awesome adventure!,"We didn’t know what to expect. Thinking that we will be cycling normal bikes, we were pleasantly surprised that we will be actually cycling rail bikes on the rail tracks! Beautiful scenery along the tracks and the weather was cold. Thus, the activity warms our cold bodies. An activity not to be missed."
Kids had fun,"During spring time it must be beautiful scene, when we were there it was late autumn but it was enjoyable anyway. You can go there all year round but they will stop operating only during the rainy day.From Seoul city, it took about almost 2 hours (plus walking and get lost). Since the railway route was quite confused to us so we arrived there later than what we booked the time but it was fortunate there were not many people on that day so ticket officer still let us ride without purchasing new tickets.Most review recommended to purchase ticket in advance and I do agree. But if you would purchase in advance you need to arrive there 30mins before your booking time. What happened to us we just got lost and arrived there one hour delayed. VR can be rented at ticketing office and not via online, you will received VR at the last tunnel of the ride.It might not be worth for adult to play with it but for the kids they kind of enjoyed it.(Shooting monster)When the ride was done, we had to wait for about 20 mins to get a train (Romantic train route) and then take some walk to get on a bus back to Gangchon Rail Park. It was kind of one way ride.These were all included with the ticket fare.We were there when it was cold and blanket can be rented at ticketing office."
Fun Activity & Amazing Views,"This was the first time we were experiencing a Rail Bike in Korea. It lived up to the hype surrounding such an activity. We thoroughly enjoyed the about an hour-long experience. It was a bit short in my opinion just as i was thoroughly enjoying the biking, but nevertheless, the proximity to the hills, river and the countryside was overall the ideal experience to relax. Suggest to take the 10am slot so that it is not too cold or misty but there is a good dose of sunlight without being too hot. Also, if you are looking for a slow, relaxed biking, then opt for the last few cars so that you are not pressured to have to speed up. There were a fair bit of very gentle slopes along the journey, so I personally feel the ride is very bearable even for those who are not generally fit. That is of course, assuming you are going at a slow and comfortable speed without needing to cycle quickly all the time. We took our time to venture around the village at Gangchon, instead of opting to take the shuttle bus back to Gimyujeong station. There are several eating outlets and restaurants along the road leading to Gangchon train station. The walk from the shuttle bus pick up point to Gangchon train station takes about 15 minutes. From Gangchon, there is an option to visit the Gugok falls as well, reachable via bus 50 at the bus stop near the shuttle bus pick up point. (bus 50 comes only once an hour)"
interesting work out but poor scenery in late autumn,"It was rather expensive. we paid about $15 SGD for person. Come in early autumn for the fall foilage, or winter for snow scapes instead."
Awesome ,"Wanted to skip this attraction but lucky we decided to proceed. Advise to make a booking before going down as the rail ride has hourly time slot and crowd is there too. Total rail ride is about 30-40 mins which brings us to another location wherewe will be transferred to a train which takes about 20-30 mins. From there, we can either walk to Gangchon station(one station away from the original station of the railpark) or take the free shuttle bus back to the railpark entrance. The whole rail and train ride is Super scenic and beautiful. Seeing mountains with beautiful autumn leaves and along a Long stream. They named it romantic Chuncheon and is definitely renowned for that. Will strongly recommend visiting this attraction. Needs to allocate at least 2 hours for this activity. "
Worthwhile attraction,The Ganchon rail park is an old train track that was converted to a rail park. The attraction for this park is that you pedal your way in a track inside a small bike train car. You can do the bike train for 4 people or 2 people. The route has great and stunning views of the river and mountain side. We had fun pedaling our way to the other side of the track which passes thru tunnels that have different themes. The stunning views of the route make this attraction worthwhile.
First Time Riding a Rail Bike,"One of the attractions included in a 1-day local tour trip. Fun experience in riding a 4-person rail bike passing through several tunnels. Bad experience was the front bike stopped for taking pictures (found out later that they were local Korean women) and created a rail jam, all bikes packed together. It started to rain heavily half way on the bike however thanks to the local tour company as they provided raincoats for all of their customers."
Book Earlier Times!,"I joined a tour to visit this rail park, during Korean Thanksgiving. Everywhere was packed with people and the traffic was very congested! So once we arrived and wait till our turn for the rail bike, the sun is gone.To be honest, the view was great, and is a nice experience. But without the sun, everything seemed a bit dull and temperature a bit cool, and the destination felt a bit far.Tho i would still recommend to have a try!"
Book ahead!,"Just thought I would leave a review here. We went on the way back from Nami as a sudden decision. It looks fun, but we couldn't go on as it was booked out. If you want to go, would be wise to book ahead so you don't miss out "
Great view and a great experience,"If you ever wanted to ride a ""bicycle"" on a railroad, this place is for you. Visitors are able to ""cycle"" on a modified bike along what used to be a railroad across themed tunnels and fields of scenery. While the ride got tiring at times, I enjoyed this place as the views were absolutely amazing and the place also put together some quirky tunnels that we had to cycle through. Quite an interesting experience.Would recommend visiting this place as part of the tour, as getting here from Seoul alone is not easy."
A Great diversion for a few hours with great views!,"This is a pedal bike on a railway where you can choose either a 2 seater or a 4 seater. The 2 seater is more expensive. The entire experience takes about 1.5-2hrs, depending on how fast you cycle. After you complete the 6km ride, a train will take you back to the beginning at Gangchon station. I am very tall and could not pedal. Therefore, the other 3 riders made up for my slack. If you do choose to come here, try to do so when there is an overcast - unless you are looking to get a tan. It's very hot during the summer and there's very little protection from the sun. The best part of this ride are the majestic views of the Korean countryside. There are some tunnels with light and sound shows, but they only act as segways to the next landscape scenes."
Exciting Riding With Nice Scene,We do take the 2 seater instead of 4 seater eventhought the price is higher. But we do enjoy much with the beautiful scene and cold weather during the riding. This is really fun and exciting.
Interesting ride,"This ride is an hour away from Seoul. There’s options of 2 and 4 seater bike. Booking can be made online. It seems fully book when I arrived as all the seats were taken up. The ride bring you through a couple of tunnels and some greenery views. Interesting ride, we took it as it’s was on the way while we are travelling to another part of Seoul. Probably won’t recommend if to make a special trip down just for the ride "
Very nice railbike experience ,"My kids loved it so much! It was so fun for them to do railbike, they enjoyed the journey! beyond our expectations ❤️ "
Fun and entertaining ,"Gangchon is a beautiful place to visit and to experience the rail bike ride and train ride.We drove in from chuncheon city area and arrived at the park in 15 mins. It was an easy drive and there was a carpark right infront of the gimyujeong station. Parking is free. Pls book your tickets in advance online via various sources like klook or kkday. There will be different time options for you to select. The entire experience took about 1.5-2hrs, depending on how fast you cycle. After a 6km ride, a train will take you to Gangchon station. Thereafter, you will have to walk about 500m to where the shuttle bus awaits to bring you back to the starting point, or you may opt to stay in gangchon or go on as per your itinerary. We took a 4 person rail bike and my 5 yr old daughter enjoyed it the most as she did not need to peddle at all, the parents did the job! The railbike will enter a few tunnels along the route, 1 is a bubble tunnel where bubbles would be floating about as you ride through it. My daughter loved that tunnel! At 1 point, they would take a foto of you and you may purchase this foto when u complete the ride at the foto booth for 10,000won.We had an amazing time at Gangchon railbike and would love to visit again in winter sometime in the near future for a different view and experience!"
railbike in korea,"very good entertainment, railbike from one point to another point, then go with the big train to other point then can walk a little bit in this area, there is a big bus very many buses to go back to trainstation of the beginning point, is all incl the price of the railbike. please when buy railbike mention to buy the AR view, is very fun dont mind what time as all is full but 1730 is ok take that one, then just stand in quee, as you are at 1200. waiting list. "
Fun experience,"Did not expect much when coming to this rail park but indeed enjoyed it! Scenery was great, streams, paddy fields and mountains. The place is slightly off city centre but I got a tour there so it was easy for us to get there. Sad that the paddling part was relatively short - roughly 30-45mins for 6+km. The other downside is when there are bikes too close to you and you have to keep a lookout to prevent accidents but such things can’t really be avoided. Depends on how crowded it is on that day as well.Should try at least once if you are travelling to Seoul."
Cool,"The view was fantastic. It’s fun actually except that it’s a bit tiring. The tunnels surprised us with music, bubbles, light, etc. It’s cool and entertaining for adults and kids. "
Not in Seoul!,"Please be aware that even though the Gangchon Rail Park is described as being in Seoul, it is realistically at least 2 hours from Seoul by any means of transport!"
Too hot for summer,"Despite having booked the slot at 12pm. We had to stand in the sun till 12.20pm before we finally get up the bikes, with the person in charge speaking in korean for the past 20 mins and I had no idea if i was in the right queue. The cycling portion was quite interesting since it's my first rail bike experience. However, the view was pretty normal. Maybe going in autumn or spring will be better?After around 30 mins of cycling, we had to get off our bikes and wait till the last bike to arrive before we had the romantic train ride. Again, the view was pretty boring on the romantic train ride.We had 2 choices after the train ride. Either we can walk for 1.3km to gangchon station. Or walk for 10 mins and there is a free shuttle bus back to Gimyucheong station. We chose the shorter route which is to take shuttle bus. 10 mins walk under the hot sun and when we arrived at the shuttle bus the driver was not there and another 10 mins under the sun before the driver finally came and opened the door. Recommend people who are interested, to come on a cooler season or a more interesting season. If not, do prepare yourself for the sun and very normal green views. "
One of the most interesting and fun exp for allfye,"Total tour duration about 1.5hours. Suitable for everyone regardless of age. Didn’t had to paddle much as it was mostly downslope. The ride was fun and interesting. Beautiful scenery and interest tunnel with specialised theme. Bring a wide angle camera to capture all your picture!Paddle for 20mins and there’s a pit stop for you to buy photo and snacks. End of rail bike. After break, board a bigger train to the end stop with rest of the people who started at the same timing as you. Everything is in Korean and no English, we had no idea what we were waiting for untill the bigger train arrive. There was nowhere to go at the the pit stop, no toilet as well. Minus the no English translation, everything was fun!! Highly recommended "
Railway below the mountain,"Rain didnt stop us in trying this activity. The store sells rain coat and even shoe cover to prevent us from getting wet. You will pass by tunnels with different teams. You can see the mountain, fields and rivers along the way. I would like to come back here during autum or cherry blossom to enjoy the view"
Better to visit in Spring or Autumn,"Was there with my 2 teenage girls in early April and the ride was good. However, I believe that the scenery would be much nicer if it's spring (later part) or autumn. The trees were still bare and no flowers when we were there but the view of mountains was good. Have to book the timeslot earlier (through online), otherwise you might have to wait for 2 hours for your turn (tour groups comes in batches)"
Unique activity,At first I was hesitant on taking this activity as it seems boring but I was wrong. My wife and I really enjoyed this. We get to see the suburb places in Korea. Although you need to have energy to do this activity. You will be pedaling until the pitstop to complete this activity. I suggest to be in active wear when doing this activity. Must try!
Change of date ,I have made a booking but the system showed a different date during the booking process . I have been trying to contact the trip advisor but can’t get thru the line and there is no email that I can send my request . 
Not in Winter,"We came here with the tour from Seoul. Definitely did not expect the temperature here is so much colder than Seoul. The Bike ride should be very fun and scenery. Unfortunate, the temperature was just too cold for us to enjoy. We wanted to ride faster so we can finish our trip earlier; but as we moved faster, so do the cold wind on our bodies........... Not coming back no more."
Nuce but tiring,Scenery along the rail was nice but I find the VR inside the tunnels to be too artificial. The entire was also slightly tiring especially for elderly people and young kids.
Great!,"Fun afternoon at the gangchon rail park taking you through all the scenic routes by a now disused railway, me and my partner got a couples carriage and you have to pedal your way around, great fun and great views definitely recommend if you have a couple of hours to kill!"
"It's fun, but it's way to cold at this time of the year","The rail bike is fun. Basically you'll bike for 6 km (mostly downhill) and then you'll take a train to the old Gangchon station. There's a shuttle bus to take you back to the starting point at Gimjujeong station. They decorated the tunnels with lights and the sound effects are also cool. The scenery is quite beautiful along the way too. On the down side, it's way too cold to do it in late January (it was -28 degree Celsius that day with windchill factor) and I could barely feel my toes and fingers. The small train was not heated (kinda a norm in Korea -- most subway stations and train stations are not heated either) and the bitter coldness took away the fun partly. Besides, it's about 2 hours away from Seoul. It makes more sense to do it as a bundle with Nami Island, Petit France, and Garden of Morning calmness. As we've been to those places already, we came just for the rail bike and had spicy chicken lunch in Chuncheon. I think it's not that worthwhile on its own."
Rail Biking! Nice new experience.,"We tried the Gangchon Rail Park, and took the Rail Bike. It was freezing, as heavy snow wad falling, but it was exciting and a new experience for us. We would try this again, if we ever get back to Seoul."
Totally excellent experience!,"This is a unique and excellent experience in the South Korean countryside. I visited in winter (January) and the area had a light amount of snow around.Most of the rail bike journey is downhill, therefore, you don't actually have to pedal much.I want to do this again in the summer months."
"Great, fun, special unique for a family","Depends on the number, you can get 2 or 4 seats car. Staff will help you to take photo. Honestly, they are the friendliest staff you will meet in Korea. A couple of minutes are enough to judge. At the beginning it is a downwards slope, so a little cycle is required. You will pass through short tunnels and river on your right. You will enjoy the scenery. Balance your energy and keep something till the end. One rider front and back should be ok and can swap. After all cars reach the end line, a train will escort all to near by station, so finish line is not the same as end line. Ride start each hour, first come first serve."
A different experience during winter,The rail bike is an excellent different activity. It is cold during winter so must peddle so that we dont feel cold. Scenery was beautiful during dec. Be armed with heat packs. 
Fun Ride,"It was -9c when we did our rail bike activity but it didn’t stop us, not that we can stop also after you have started biking. ;-) The route brings you to the pretty sceneries of river with mountains as their backdrop. A relaxing ride, don’t need to feel in a hurry, and the paddling is a great exercise/movement while being blasted with cold winds constantly. Go on with full winter gear when you are there during winter. The mid stop gives you a chance to rest your legs and buy some hot food n drinks while waiting for the train to return to the final stop. "
Fun and interesting activity to do along with Nami Island visit,"Fun to ride the rail bike and get to see the scenic views of the countryside. It was a leisure self peddle ride and we did not find it to be tiring.The activity had a 40mins self peddle ride before stopping for a brief stop and transferring to a 15mins train ride. At the end of the ride, a short walk to the shuttle bus to take us back to the entrance. Total time 1.5 hours.Probably the only cons is to have to wait for slow 'riders' who clog up the track in front of you :)Overall, we would recommend this activity as part of the day visit to Nami island.To get to this place, you will need to take the ITX-Cheongchun express train to gapyeong station and transfer over to the normal train on the opposite platform. Do remember to tap your Tmoney card on the transfer machine. Stop at Gimyujeong statntion."
Fun but chilly,Biking is about tedious for people with long legs. Scenery during ride is enjoyable but do put on full winter gear (including mask & beanie) as it gets really chilly. Unique and fun experience that everyone should try out
Tiring but awesome..,Great place to go if you have a young children..great experience for my family as we cycle using the rail bike and enjoy the scenery..
"Fun two hours, but could be run better",The 45 minute ride can be pretty fun...they did a good job of using a defunct rail line...some of the tunnels have some cool lighting and even offer a virtual reality goggle section for an extra 1000 won...the problem is there is only one rail line...and all it takes is one group to hold up the line by taking selfies or just not pedaling at a decent pace...the bikes need to be spaced out better...or separate by slow/fast riders...
heavy snow and rain,"I booked the tour to nami island + petite france+ gangchon rail park through KLOOK .While nami island and petite france were great this was the worst experience we had at our holiday in korea.The railbike was our last destination of the tour so it was arnd 4pm when we boarded the railbike . It was already raining heavily when we boarded the railbike but the rain got worse 5min thru the ride and it started snowing heavily.since u need to stretch out ur legs to pedal and the shelter doesnt cover ur legs if u seat at the front. Me and my daughter had to endure the heavy snow with our two layers of pants,shoes and socks soaking wet when we finished the ride while my father and brother who sat behind werent as wet tho still to the extent of getting their pants soaked. we were just too cold and uncomfortable to enjoy the beautiful scenery creating a terrible experience for us. people frm our tour also had their clothes and shoes soaking wet when they finished the ride . We then had to endure 50 minutes of the train ride which nobody cld not enjoy at all with such soaked clothes when evrybody was just too cold .since the ride is q far frm the city at seoul we still had to endure 2 hours of bus ride back to seoul.Therefore i strongly recommend u check the weather forecast before u go to the railbike ride as u will not enjoy it at all in case of bad weather. Especially during winter, I strongly recommend for children to sit at the back in case of bad weather. While i didnt have a good experience there i wld try and go back tho no during winter and strongly recommend u not to go there during winter if theres bad weather."
The Fun ride ever for with kids. ,"Arrive at Gimyujeong Station, walking distance to the entrance at rail park. The day we when was raining. It was unexpected. Just prepare urself a poncho. U can bought it at a nearby shop in the area. The mnth we get to used VR for uder tunnel ride. So much fun especially for kids.the ride is cool enuf.Theres 10-15mins interval break and change for a train inside of ride. *for muslim, pls note that there is no halal food out there. Just bring light snack for ur lil ones like i did. HeheAfter finish ride, proceed and follow the crowd to get a free shuttle bus back to gimyujeong station. Basically aftr ride, just go to straight and turn left side and straight till u saw gs25 n turn left and turn right after u saw few busses. "
A new try. Fun but crowded,"A new try for us. We were unluckly that there's lots of people playing railbike that day causing a traffic jam, otherwise it would be fun."
Views and Tunnels were AMAZING!,"I didn't know too much of what to expect, but my experience was very pleasant! It was very easy pedaling through as there is a lot of momentum throughout the trail. the views that you ride through are amazing and breathtaking as well as being a breath of fresh air from the bustling city. The tunnels that you go through are so fun and at times i wished we went through more! Only downside to it is that at times there could be alot of slow traffic since if one group decides to slow down it affects everyone! the second half of the experience you ride a old steam train which was very pleasant also!"
Pedal to the End,"The concept is pretty neat and fun to ride in a cart and peddling with friends or family. It was a good distraction to the usual tourist offerings but after a while, I simply wanted to reach the end and get off. If you can, do not engage during the hot humid summer months. It is no fun. The 6.5 km peddling did not offer much of nice sceneries and the tunnels were the only reprieve from the hot weather."
Fun rides with family,I booked gangchon railbike via funtastickorea and incorporated in the last leg of my private van hire day trip.It is a 30min drive from nami island. I booked 5pm bike but the sun was still scorching hot. My young kids could not reach the paddle but they have fun on the railbike.The ride starts from Gimyoujeong station. The mixture of beautiful scenery and themed tunnels made the whole ride enjoyable though the 50min ride was quite tiring when on upslope. We were given 3free VR spects for trial in one of the tunnels. But we couldnt really figure out how to shoot the monsters by pressing the side buttons.There's a 15 to 20min break at the rest stop where you can grab a snack. The final part is the 15 to 20min romantic train ride ending at gangchon station. My whole family enjoyed the railbike package very much.
HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!,"If there were 10 stars I would give 10. Despite the long traveling time, my friend and I decided to try rail biking at Gangchon rail park. After exiting at Gimyoujeong station exit 1, turn right, and the rail park sign should be visible. We went on a Tuesday, so the crowd was not that bad. Even though we reached at 4pm, we managed to book 2-person rail bike for 6pm. The trail was relatively easy to bike through, as it involved quite a number of downward slopes. There were also interesting tunnels the rail bike passed through; my favorite being the 'happy bubble tunnel'. The view was SPECTACULAR even during summer! We passed by many fields and streams, and it was not as hot as expected, as there was wind while cycling. My friend and I were surprised when the trail ended, as it seemed far too fast. The timing was great as it was less sunny, and we managed to catch glimpses of the sunset nearing the end of the rail biking.Overall, a great experience! Highly recommended if you can afford the traveling time :) would definitely go again!"
Very interesting experience,I went there in April this year with good weather. It is not hard to finish the whole trip but it is quitter far away from the down town. The view is so nice and my friends also enjoyed playing there!!! will go there again with other people.
Summer @Gangchon Rail Park,"Was there in end Jun. We booked the 1st timing at 9am on a Monday. Hoping to avoid the crowd and also, not too hot for the rail bike and more time for other sight-seeing places. We took train from Myeongdong at about 6am and reached Gimyujeong stn at about 8.15am after few changing/transferring trains. Not that difficult to travel on your own actually. Rail Park was just few minutes walk from Gimyujeong stn. Ride was not tedious at all, after 50mins, there was a rest stop followed by a romantic train ride and free shuttle bus back to the stn. Fun and nice experience. But not much scenary actually."
Lots of fun,"When you go to Nami,don't miss Gangchon rail park..At first i can't imagine how to ride in the same time with others..maybe with 50 people..but when i saw so many railbikes there..it was so exciting.We move together and rode the bike..especially when moved so fast and saw beautiful sceneries and also tunnels.really fun!"
Very fun activity! So worth it!,"We booked this activity as part of our anniversary trip and it was one of the hightlights our trips! Unbelievably, we had so much fun. We had so much laughter with all the thrills and fun we had. I surely clocked a lot of my ""steps"" in my activity tracker. Highly recommended activity not only for couples, or family but a great bonding for friends too! "
Fun day trip from Seoul,"Went to the Gangchon Rail Park with my wife and 2 boys. We booked as part of a one-day tour out of Seoul that also included Nami Island. For us, the Rail Bike experience was great. The staff knows enough English to help you understand the basics of operating the four-seater bike we used. The rail bike uses tracks that are no longer used by proper trains and it goes on a gradually downward slope for a great part of the course. There are a couple of flat stretches where you have to pedal, but it doesn't require a lot of effort. The tracks go through rice paddies and along a river and through a couple of tunnels, some which are themed (bubbles, star lights, and a war/fire mildly scary for smaller children). It is a great getaway from the frenzy of Seoul, although the KPop played at the station at the start of the course is a bit off-putting. The views, especially those overlooking the river are great. The tunnels provide cool relief if you are doing the course in warm weather. If in Seoul with family, I highly recommend this day trip activity."
Interesting rail bike ride,"We went together as 3 families with young children. According to my husband, the rail bike ride is the best attraction for the entire korea trip. The railbike is an interesting concept. Though it was an 1.5 hr attraction, we cannot feel really feel that 1.5hr has passed. In fact, time passes very quickly. There are 3 tunnels along the way which make the ride even more interesting. All adults and children enjoyed the ride except that we dont understand why we need to take the train back, it will be good if we can take the rail bike back. Nice scenery and great attraction! "
Remarkable,"Rail bike is an interesting and unique, a must-try activity for all visitors. While pedalling the bike on a discontinued railroad tracks, we enjoyed the beautiful scenery of Bukhangang River area. The track is long enough to enjoy the views but not too long to make the ride too tiring. We passed by a few tunnels, made interesting by music, lights and even bubbles.The bikes can accommodate up to 4 pax. The ride starts from Gimyujeong Station and ends in intermediate station. From there, the journey continues by taking a train to Gangchon Station.Two thumbs up!"
Fun! Favourite activity in Seoul,"Love this ride, it's fun with good view along the rail. Every tunnel will give you a little surprise. You do not have to ride your way back~ there is a train ride back to a designated pick up point. Something interesting other than shopping and food hunting in Seoul. "
Rail biking in korea!,"We went in March it was a little cold as the start but once we were moving was fine. It was a beautiful and unique way to see the countryside. The park was right in front of the station , we booked online and it was as easy as that. It only takes up 2 hours so afterwards we zip-lines across to Nami Island and spent the rest of our day there."
Amazing views!,I took the 1 and a half hour rail bike tunnel route and it was amazing! The countryside view was very beautiful. I also went through a few tunnels during the route and each of the tunnels had a different theme and was well decorated. Would definitely recommend this to anyone. 
Fun!,Had no choice because the family already booked this in advance. It was fun until we had to follow an old couple which could not catch up with the rest of the group. Over-all it was ok.
Definitely a must-try activity,"Our family enjoyed this activity when we were in SK. We enjoyed not just the experience of rail-biking, but also the beautiful sceneries of the countryside. The best part for my kids are passing through the different tunnels that have different setups - bubble, lights, and especially the VR tunnel, which my son absolutely loved."
Fun activities,"visit this place with booking one day tour location is nearby to nami island around 20 minutes by cari went to this place with tour because i want to visit 4 places nami island, petite france, rail park and garden of morning calm which location os nearby and dont want to waste my time waiting for local bus and trainbike are so fun if u visit with family and friendsu can enjoy farm view while u are bikingu also will enter a few tunnel with music and lights insidethey have stop area for resting and u will transfer to train and no more bikingstart area and finish area is different placeso if are coming with no tour you need to follow the sign on finish area for taking shuttle bus to start areabiking in spring, wind was cold so u can use mask to cover your nose but overall it's not tired activities it was so fun and my family love it"
OB & YB competition. ,"Our family enjoyed a lot this place. It was a very unique and unforgettable experience. They built on the site where the train on the Gyeongchun Line stops, Gangchon Rail Park is a popular tourist attraction where visitors can pedal along old railroad tracks while taking in the lovely Bukhangang River scenery. We competed and the OB team won the game and the lunch as the prize!"
Cool Thing Must Do in Seoul,"Ganchon rail bike suitable for those who like outdoor activity while see the beautiful scenery of the Ganchon. The riding experience was fun and not strenuous at all and we enjoyed it. It was as we had expected. There were 3 tunnels along the way that were decorated with loads of lights and music. Everyone of us have a great time cycling along the rail. Overall experience is very good.Actually, the rail was all flat or downhill for about 50 minutes then take train to the destination. Finally, we take shuttle bus back to Gimyujeong station."
Great experience ,Went to the park in early Mar'17. Booked the tickets via klook as the official website is in Korean language only. It's easy to cycle and great way to enjoy the nature. There's a rest stop before you transfer onto the 'romantic train' where you will enjoy the rest of the park with the driven train. Shuttle bus provided at the ending point to bring you back to the start point where kimyoujeong station is. There's also a dal komm coffee next to the park. 
Railbike for 80 minutes for 10 KM,"Start at Kim Yujeong station( named after a korean poet) Worried if it was too strenous having to pedal constantly for 80 minutes. Actually, the rail was all flat or downhill for 40 minutes then. take train to the destination. you can take shuttle back to Kimyujeong station. or go from gangchon station to next destination."
Great experience,It was a good experience. U will love the 30 minutes cycling on the rail bike. I went during winter so I could still see snow. The view around was really breathtaking. U can book this through KLOOK apps and it's easy to use and book.
Lots of fun,I like my trains and what a great use of some old track. We could do with a few of these in the UK. The rail park is well organised with cars? Bikes? Trolleys? for 2 or 4 people. They are well maintained and not hard to peddle. A lot of the route has a gentle decline so you don't even have to peddle much of the distance. There are set departure times so bikes leave en masse. For good reason because after a few km there is a picnic spot and then a train journey to the far end of the track where coaches return you to the start. The route follows a pretty river valley and passes some mountain hillsides and smallholding farms. Works well for all ages and easily accessible by train from Chuncheon. 
Boring place,Its my first time to take a rail bike .... i have no idea why its popular.. Cant believe that i heard Gangnam style again here.... every each tunnel they turned on some old song.. well of course it depends on person but fot me... this is waste of time and money. Kimyoojung station is beautiful tho
LOVE IT! tiring but spectacular view,"Can easily get package of Nami Island + Rail Bike + Petite France from Funko or Trazy which include transport that transfer us to these places, pick us up from and to our accommodation area and entrance fee. Started off with safety guidelines by the safety officer to a big group of us riding at that timeslot. No regrets. Love the experience or rail biking. Distance is quite long though. Can be tiring. We rode in a group of 3. One of us must keep paddling or the bike will stop and that will cause hogging on the track. Although, we started off with a cold day, I can guarantee you that you will be taking off your jacket by the end of the ride due to perspire. The surrounding view is just spectacular. Went through several tunnels with music and lights inside.At the end of the ride, we will have to transfer to a train that brought us back to our coach. The view thereon is even much scenic.. Overall, it was tiring but worth it. LOve Love...."
Unique way to experience scenery,"This place is located in Chuncheon, so it take about 2 hours to reach here from Seoul. Upon reaching the station, the entry sign is large and obvious so you cannot miss it.It's not actually really tough to cycle the rail bike, but do not believe that it will move by itself as mentioned by some others! The bike eventually came to a stop if no one is cycling, except when on downhill of course~ Slowly take your time and cycle and you will find that it is very enjoyable, like a mini workout with great scenery and ""oppa gangnam style!!"" (try it and you will know what i meant!)"
New Exciting Attraction,"This place located around 1 hour train ride from Seoul. A little bit tricky when you have to change train from one to another, but we manage to arrive without a problem thanks to the informations from internet :). Located just beside Gimyujeong Station, the entrance already make us amaze. Even though it was freezing at that time, we had a very great experience. Fully recommended, for couple or family."
Lots more fun than expected even on a freezing day,"Some part of the route is scenic. it doesn't required a lot of physical strength. I can imagine that it can be a romantic ride for young couple. There is photo spot that takes photo automatically and you can buy it at 10,000won. After the rail bike ride there's a concession stop and a few souvenir stops while waiting for the train to arrive. "
Unique attraction which you have to try if you visit Korea,"Visited this attraction as part of a tour package. Its about half hour drive away from Nami island.Besides the railway, there was a cosy cafe nearby.The whole ride was approx. 8 to 10km long and took around 1 hour return trip.It was very scenic and went over a wide river too.After one half of the journey, there was a turntable to swing us back the opposite direction.We rode this on 23-Dec so it was right smack during winter and the temperature that day was 0 degs celcius so it was really cold, windy and snowing lightly. Not recommended to ride in such weather.However, it was a very unique experience which I recommend to try when visiting Korea."
"Good, exciting ride!","A very good ride, even in the cold weather (snowing when we rode). We pre-booked tickets, were late, but the counter staff changed it to a later time for us. Maybe because it's not so crowded in winter. The scenery was good along the way, and there was staff to supervise and some small decorations to keep the ride interesting when the scenery got boring. I liked it also because there was no need to make a U-turn and go back the same way, which might have been boring. Good to go, but do cater for wet weather. Tend to get wet if it rains."
Good choice of outdoor activity,"First time experience rail bike and it was great!Best rail route ever, all along the way we can enjoy the spectacular view which is really amazing. When you tired, you can slow down your pace and no one will shout at you. 2 hours of rail bike is just not enough for me. Although i go on Sept and weather still hot, but is not really very hot when i do rail bike as there is shade on top of the rail bike. Along the way i ride, i feel quite enjoy as it is windy. Highly recommend must go place in Korea. This place is also easy access with LRT."
Gangchon Eco Rail Ride!,"The journey was abit chilling with less than 5 degrees. However with you putting in work on the pedal, it sure is not an issue. Beautiful scenery and with prepared themes in 3 different tunnel passage will make you go wow wow wow."
Highly recommended!,"As this is an off-peak travel season (in Winter), I do not have a problem renting a 2-seater bike with no prior reservations, and it is a truly exhilarating, fun way to take in all the beautiful scenery that Chuncheon has to offer. The entire 50 min (including a 20 min ride on their romance train and free shuttle back to GimYuCheong station) went by in a flash!"
Marvellous views and unique experience,"If you want to experience what it feels like to cycle along old rail lines, look no further. This attraction is as authentic as it gets. Not only does it leave you with an unforgettable experience, you get to enjoy scenic views while giving your legs a good workout! This is a must-visit if you are in the area!"
An interesting easy going activity,"An interesting outdoor activity for families and couples.Am convinced that the carts would move without pedalling as it was very easy to move. Some nice views of the countryside and some quirky tunnel experiences ranging from bubbles, romantic music to a rave style light show with Gangnam style music!!We took the trip at end of October and it was cold so make sure to wrap up well if you dont like the cold!Toilets at the changeover stop are not great (hold your breath!)Overall an enjoyable experience but did not feel the need to do again,"
Stunning views and great opportunity for leg workout,Booked online. A worthwhile trip. A great experience and a good activity to do with friends or family. We got to enjoy the beautiful scenery as we cycled. Cycling was fun and not strenuous at all. Loved going through the tunnels especially with the one with music. It was very fun and loved to do it again.
Great for couples ,"Very nice and romantic place to be when you travel with your love one. There are lots of sight seeing throw out the rail. And it's very easy to get it move, you don't need a lot of energy. Very fun and relaxing:) will love to go again!"
Stunning views!,"This was such a wonderful way to take in the beautiful mountains and countryside of Korea. It was not very strenuous and the views were amazing. It lasted long enough and even had some fun tunnels to go through with led lights and music blasting. Pro Tip: Go early and have a beer outside while you wait. The best time to go is in the Fall before it gets too cold so you can see the colors changing. I imagine the Spring is nice too. Also, book a tour just before sunset to get some amazing pictures!"
Nice scenery and workout,"Went as part of a day trip package. Had no option to change to a 2 seater bike.. ended up peddling like mad as the couple behind decided they were too good to be helping out.Overall view is nice and the tunnels with the music and lights was an interesting touch to the ride. Bring along some water as once you reach the end of the station, you will be thirsty and the stalls selling drinks are at a premium price."
Thrill & Fun,"The weather was good, sunny with breeze. The scenery was extremely beautiful. The ride was thrilling and fun. I highly recommend this activity. It's the best of my whole trip!"
Fun but tiring,"We spent a day out of Seoul, and this was the first stop after a 2hr subway ride. It was a week day and we got a four seater without a problem. The ride was fun but tiring. We really enjoyed the ride. Wirth a visit if you plan going outside Seoul. Nami island and Petite France is also nearby."
Very fun leisure riding around the mountain,"It was still summer but as the rail was around the base of the mountain, the ride was cooling. The ride starts from gimyujeong station, exit the station and Turn Right"" and walk about 100m across the carpark. I went on a Thursday (which most tours surprisingly don't offer) and bought tickets on the spot for the 12 pm slot. 25000 won for a 2- seater. Everyone rides on the same track and we all set off together 1 by 1 keeping about 3m apart. After 1 hour you change to an old train to gangchon. Supposingly you can get on the Seoul train at gangchon, but we couldn't see the station and the staff spoke in Korean, so we just followed the crowd to walk towards the shuttle/dedicated bus about 300m away and took the bus back to gimyujeong station. After this consider visiting Nami island. "
Fun Riding with Very Nice View,"I really want to try this, since I watched it on Running Man (Korean reality show). I have so much fun riding the rail bike. Outstanding view and riding the rail bike with good friends was very entertaining. 1,5 hours seems like minutes only. You don't have to worry, the rail tracks is decline. It is easy to pedal, especially for 4 person.Since it is a popular tourist attraction, better you make reservation. Remember, be on time, as the ticket will be forfeited. If you go in the summer, remember to bring sun glasses and hat. The heat is really annoying. However, with a nice breeze and nice view, it is still a pleasant exprience."
Enjoyable trip to Gangchon Rail Park,"We went in Summer. Weather was good and not too warm. The scenery was beautiful. I can imagine it will be even more beautiful in autumn or spring.We enjoyed the ride in the tunnel with music and special lighting.The ride was about half an hour and we took a train ride. After this, we walked quite a distance to the shuttle bus which brought us back to the starting point."
Fantastic experience!!!,"We went for rail biking on 22nd April 2016. We booked our tickets 20 days prior to our planned date as I had read in some blogs its safe to book well in advance. They have limited bikes, especially two seaters, so its recommended to book in advance. There are many ways to book the ticket online. We booked a 12pm slot through the main rail biking korean website with the help of our korean friend. For a two seater we were charged 25,000KRW.To reach the starting point, we took a regular all stop subway till Gimyujeong. Come out of the station and on the right you can locate rail bike centre. Takes 2-3 minutes walk from subway to the ticket counter. Collect your ticket and wait for your slot to get started. At the starting point, they we will tell you some safety measures in korean only. We were only able to understand them whenever they used any hand gestures.Rail bike experience was an amazing one. Riding a bike along with your loved one surrounded by a nature's beauty. It was greenery all around us at this time of the month. I wish I had come here in the winters when I could see everything covered around me with snow. Tunnel experience was also really good, but do keep a check on your speed as its dark inside and takes a moment to adjust with your eyes. Rock music tunnel and romantic song tunnel were too much fun. There will be a stopping point in between where the guards will ask you to deboard the bike and wait for the train to come. An open train will arrive and you will have to board it to reach Gangchon station.All in all, it was a different and a very new experience for us. Would highly recommend to include it in your itinerary if you're planning to visit Nami Island. We clubbed rail biking and nami island including ziplining to make our day more exciting.Good luck! :)"
Interesting experience,"We booked out trip with Trazy and this is one of the trip destination. We went there by the tour bus. Good thing our guide brief us on how to use the rail bike as the instructions given by the staff there are in Korean only. The ride was very interesting and wonderful view from the surrounding area. Halfway through the ride you will see a signage that says ""Photo Point"" or something like that, please get ready to post for the camera ahead. The whole journey as our guide told us was roughly about an hour including the train ride back. We did not really looked at the time while cycling so not too sure whether it was right or not as it may also depend on the cycling speed of people in front of you. When it is time to stop the staff will tell you to do so. The stop area has a little store that sell ice cream and some other snacks, no sure how long we waited before we saw the staff signalling everyone to back off the track, as they spoke in korean we were not so sure but we saw a train in front and everyone starting boarding so we just follow the flow. Once up the train, there was music and recording being played, it was in korean again so not sure of the content. When we reached the end station, everyone alighted and went to view/purchase their photo taken eariler. Our tour bus was there to wait for us to board. Overall not to be missed ride. "
 Train ride of a different kind ,Very nice adventure. You are riding your own train and see a different aspect of Korea. Friendly and well organized. English speaking staff. And don't forget to smile for the picture they will sell at the end of the ride. Plan for 2 hours total. Was really fun for our 2 children aged 8 and 10. Will go back again....
A unique and fun experience,"I booked my tickets through funko. It was a little difficult to reach there and as it was out of Seoul, the frequency of trains was very low. We had to wait more than 20 minutes for a train. However the ride was very fun. My husband and I had a great time. Bear in mine though that no English instructions will be given though they do try to do more hand gestures when they were trying to explain the safety regulations. The scenery was great. We passed by mountains, lakes, fields and also people's homes. There were also caves along the way which they creatively decorated to make the entire ride really wholesome. Would definitely recommend couples or families to go if they want to experience something unique in their trip. "
"Nice scenery, though a little short","We booked our tickets through Trazy a week before, and got the 2-seater bikes. Off we went -- but the front bikes were so slow, we had to stop several times. Kinda wished we had taken the front bikes instead. It didn't help that the bike behind was way too close for comfort several times. Before we knew it, the ride had come to an end and we took the train back.Complaints aside, we had an amusing time traversing through the tunnels blasting PSY's Gangnam Style and Gentlemen over and over again. The coloured lights made us feel like we were in a disco. Of course, the scenery was beautiful.We didn't see the shuttle bus when we got down from the train; there were signs but they sort of trailed off towards the main road. We ended up walking to the subway station, which was quite a distance. Truth be told, I didn't enjoy this quite as much because of the fellow bikers and the short distance. "
Ain't getting sick of it,"It's my 3rd ride and I've yet to get sick of it. The different seasons provide different sceneries. The rail park has always been renovating and improving! It's a die die must try experience, but do remember to buy tickets in advance as it's too popular. Always buy it online before heading down."
Best railbike route,"My hotel recommended going to Gyeong-gang Railpark as it is nearer to Seoul and Nami Island/Petite France, but I chose to go to this Gangchon Railpark (Gimyujeong) since it offers more scenic views and an easier descent (less tiring on the knees). We pre-booked our tickets via Funko tours and it was a hassle-free experience. There were a large group of ahjummas with us for our 11am slot so we couldn't ride as fast but it was enjoyable nevertheless "
Best time!,"As part of our private tour, we went to this place. Didn't expect it to be this much fun! You have to book in advance so make sure to let your tour guide knows. We are lucky that it's spring and all the flowers are blooming. The landscape is amazing. The bike can go really fast at times and it was so much fun!!! You can keep riding back and forth until your time is up. We did only one loop as we were really tired from the whole day of tour but I can see other people going round and round :D Definitely recommended!! It's also very reasonably priced."
Nice way to view the scenery and excerise,"The Rail bike could only be booked by Korean, you can either join local tours or ask local tours operators to book the tickets for you. There are 2 people bikes and 4 people bikes. About 8 km, not difficult. Nice way for enjoying the scenery! A bit cold on windy days though. The whole trip lasted about 1 hour, a train will take you to the station."
Half fun left,"Only half way left by bite, another half way by train. Return by shuttle bus. Everyone has to leave bite and take train after rest point! But same price, I believed. 4 seats for $35000won."
Tons of fun,"Make sure to purchase tickets before showing up. We are very glad we drove (traffic there was great and only took us just over an hour! But coming back, there were a few accidents in the tunnels so be careful) but make sure to have money for tolls and parking if you do drive. Everyone working was very nice and helpful. There are a few small arcades with games to play to spend your time before the rail ride. We had the 12 o'clock slot and packed a lunch. Which worked out perfect for when we stopped. We were in one of the first cars which made it easy for us to go fast but man. We are tired today (the next day). Highly suggest!"
Must see.,"This place took two hours by subway from Myeongdong. I was a bit skeptical to come here since it was so far from the city. If you plan to see Nami Island, Petite France or the Garden of Morning Calm then this place is worth adding on. Some people book a tour for this but I did it myself on others directions and it was easy to find. You can book your tickets in advance if you think it might be busy. I visited in March 2016 on a cold cloudy Sunday and I had a great time here. I would recommend this place."
Must be physically fit to do this,Be ready to pedal at the same pace as everyone else before and after you. I remember that the passengers of one car was asked to get off at the rest stop because they were too slow. :( I suggest that you use your strength on the uphill and use inertia on the downward slopes.
something new,it is really cool for sightseeing. and good for family bonding. you can talk and laugh surrounded by beautiful nature. it is a must try. you will really enjoy it.
A wonderful experience!,"The rail bike ride is new adventure experience for me. You can go there by subway train. The ticket is available at the entrance. There are a few routes that you can choose. The views along the ride are to die for. Blending with the nature and perfect sceneries, make my trip to the railbike park a wonderful experience."
Awesome rail bike,"Biking on the old rail to Gangchon station. You can go there by train at Gimyujeong station, the rail bike locate 500 meter from this station. The fee is 35000W (As of JAN 2016) for 4 person with the Big bike. You will see the beautifule view of the old rail road along the riverside. When bike through the tunnel they prepare amazing light for you. After finish bike, they will take you to train and explain the history of Gangchon (but in Korean) along with the beautifule river side. At the final destination they have the service bud to take you back to Gimyujeong Station.Caution. In winter it's freaky cold, be prepare the cold and wind protection as much as you can. I just face the -13 degree biking in 2016 January"
Pretty landscape,"While riding,you will be greeted by beautiful landscape. However,need to travel about 2 hours from downtown seoul. Worth visit if have time to spare."
Great activity with great scenery,"Visited Korea 4th time and this is my first time visit Gangchon Rail Park. This is a great place, great activity and great scenery. Everyone of us have a great time cycling along the rail. At the end of the rail ride, we waited and took a train back to the start point. Do visit after your meal. I will do it again cos is fun."
I would do this over and over again!!,"It's a long ride about 2.5 hours but totally worth the time. We were greeted with snowy landscape along the way by train and the moment we stepped out of Gimyujeong station, what appeared in front of our eyes was a white blanket of snow! Picturesque and breath-taking that my friend and I wanted to go back the next day just to take photos. Anyway we booked the 9am slot with Trazy but arrived slightly past 9 and the staff were nice enough to change our slot to 10am. I knew about this place from Running Man :) The rail bike was fun and we had a scenic ride. It lasted about 1.5 to 2 hours which included 3 tunnels. Totally stunning when you see snow everywhere you pedal. Yes it got a bit tiring after a while but it was worth it. At the end of the bike course we boarded a train and continued with the lovely view. Then you board a shuttle bus which brings you back to Gimyujeong station. Oh by the time we got back to Gimyujeong station, all the pure white landscape we saw earlier in the morning had melted away. If given a choice I would recommend morning slot during winter for the snowy landscape. I suppose it would be a nice view during spring and autumn as well. We very much wanted to do the rail bike again the next day but time didn't permit. Perhaps the next trip in another season for a different experience!"
Fun activity and beautiful scenery,"It is fun to bike on old tracks, and the scenery is beautiful. As it takes 2 hours to get there from Seoul city centre by metro, advance booking is recommended especially during autumn. I booked through Funko Fantastic Korea. They provide very informative and useful information in their website, and communicate quickly with you to confirm your bookings and answer your inquiries. Booking on Gangchon Rail Park's own website is possible, but you need a Korea mobile phone number. While many online bookings can be done directly with the operators, they seem to be open to Korean only as a Korean mobile phone number is always required.Gangchon is on the Choncheon Line of the Seoul metro, where Nami Island, Petite France, and the Garden of Morning Calm are on the same line. Visiting these places before heading back to Seoul is recommended."
Fun And Tranquil Ride,"We took a package tour by Ktourstory (3 places that included Rail Park, Nami Island & Garden Of The Morning Calm night light up). The ride began at Gimyujeong and stopped at a terminal about 50 mins. later. Everyone is then transferred to a shuttle train for the remainder of the journey to the end terminal at Gangchon. Our experiences at the Rail Park were as follows :Pros :1) There are 2 types of rail cars, i.e. double and quad.2) The ride was mainly downhill and easy.3) Scenery in winter was good and I suspect autumn will be excellent.4) The second tunnel were well decorated with LED lights and the last tunnel was lighted up with disco music.5) The mountain scenery was amazing and romantic.6) Managed to see a few small ""frozen waterfall"" at the terminal while waiting for the shuttle train.Cons :1) Not allowed to ride independently. Every rail car must travel in batches on the hour, i.e. 10.00am, 11.00am, 12.00pm and so on.2) Insufficient spaces in the rail car to keep small bag or haversack.3) The ride stopped at a terminal and had to wait for 30mins. for transfer to shuttle train to the end at Gangchon.Will definitely go back again during another season by train. A must visit experience."
Refeshing!,"Finally, after a couple visits to Seoul, we actually had time to allocate a good half day to have this activity 'squeezed' into our itinerary. We were here on 17th Dec on a cool wintry thursday morning - 11am slot for Quad(4 paxs at KRW38,000).The ride itself was rather short - approx. 45-60mins. Still, it was refreshing & a great change to the maddening crowd back in Seoul. Here, there's only serenity ... tranquillity & some beautiful scenery along the rail route - what better way to spend 'quality' time with loved ones and/or with one's family!. Tunnels with different themes(there's one with lights & pop music!), streams/rivers, farms & so forth. It's great tonic for the soul especially if you're coming from a city state like where I'm from - Spore!. Such simple yet beautiful scenic environment are a sight to experience & cherished!!. I would encourage all to accommodate this wonderful attraction at least once whenever they're in Seoul.Getting here from Myeongdong takes some time ... approx. 2hrs25mins. Here's how my family did it :-1) Myeongdong station(Blue Line 4) to Dongdamun History & Culture station - total 2 stops & transfer to Green Line 2 heading for Wangsimni station2) Dongdaemun History & Culture station(Green Line 2) to Wangsimni station - total  3 stops & transfer to G Line heading for Mangu station3) Wangsimini station(G Line) to Mangu station - total 5 stops & transfer to G Line heading for Gimyujeong station 4) Mangu station(G Line) to Gimyujeong station - total 17 stops. The waiting time for  the train from here to Gimyujeong will take some waiting. onwards will takeTotal, it took approx. 2hrs25mins from Myeongdong station to Gimyujeong station. Once out of Gimyujeong station, turn to your right. Walk past the carpark & head towards the booking booth to your left.Heading back ... ok, this is where the 'confusion' begins!(Lol!!). After having alighted from the 'shuttle train' which had earlier picked us up at the 'end' point' ... we were all left somewhat 'confused' as to whether the ride had ended. it certainly did not help a bit when you have the guide who could not speak a single word of English!!!. All of us were wondering whether this stop was either just a 'halfway point' of the ride or end point. Eventually, we got 2 different groups - 1 that just stood & waited around the guide while the other just took off towards the nearest train station(hand signals & signs were communicated between the guide & the group as to the general direction to the train station). We followed the group that opted to walk to the nearest train station. It was a good 20-25mins walk!!! ... before we 'found' our way to Gangchon station(the station just before Gimyujeong ... from the direction of Mangu!!). It was basically a pleasant stroll from one end to the other on a long stretch of road!!!. Still, no complaints as the weather was cool & in a strange way, ... we enjoyed the long walk!!!. So, from Gangchon station, we headed back to Seoul via reverse way when we came.Overall, it was fun ... & we enjoyed every bit of it. Cheers! - virgopq"
Riding the Rail on you own,"My family enjoyed this rail ride very much. You ride the whole rail car by yourself, for 4 or 2 pax and at your own pace. It is a one way ride between Chuncheon Station and Gim Yujeong Station. You start from one of this station and ends at the other. We decided to start from Gim Yujeong as you can reach there by the subway from Seoul. The subway ride is more than an hour so you have to plan your trip early. The rail ride is about 8km and the shuttle bus trip back to Gim Yujeong is about 6km."
Endless beauty scenery,"This rail park located a bit far away from the city. A long way to go from our station because i cant remembered how many time i fell asleep on the train :p Gangchon Rail Park is a popular attraction because many people know of this Rail Biking from the scene in Running Man tv shows and you get to ride one the ‘bike’ along the old railroad along the Bukhangang River. I recommended u guys should have a breakfast or drinks before u start ur ride to boost ur energy. Yeah u need a stamina to cycle it will get pretty tired too! As we ride, we got to see and enjoy the pretty view and scenery along the railway track. its a fun new experience to cycling and relaxing while feeling fresh breeze across ur face from nature surroundings."
Fun rail in Nami,Its a fun way to tour nami with the rail but there's just schedule you need to wait or que. Really really fun.
