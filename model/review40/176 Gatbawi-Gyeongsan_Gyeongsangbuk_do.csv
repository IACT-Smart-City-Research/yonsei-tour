Long but worthwhile climb,"Gatbawi is a good half-day excursion from Daegu but be prepared for some serious climbing! There's a map at the bottom but frankly it wasn't terribly helpful, I just followed other people. There are two ways up. The path initially heads up in one direction from the bus stop/car park. A short way up there's some stone steps off the right - take these if you want. Both the main path and the narrower path the steps lead to go past two temples before the path really diverges; one small temple and one much bigger one a little higher up. The main route up to the Buddha statue is off to the left of this larger temple, and leads up a long flight of even stone stairs. Once you're on the stairs you can't get lost. The other route is off to the right (climb up through the temple and there's a gate on the right-hand side). This is a little more of a hike with less well-defined steps and I think it's slightly longer, but the ultimate height gain is the same! There were a couple of forks towards the top, just stay left. At the top there's an area for praying and a little shop selling trinkets and water, and a toilet. Various other paths lead off into the mountains but I would recommend being properly equipped with food and water before trying those. It was a cloudy, windy day when I did this and the views were hazy but I suspect on a clear day they'd be fantastic. There is a good sense of achievement at the top and it is a very spiritual place especially with everyone praying."
a test of your physical and mental endurance,"I was one of the few non Koreans up there and to be truthful, it's not an easy climb up there. there were tons of steps that you need to conquer but the view up there was amazing. felt amazing to see how many devotees made the effort to go all the way up to pray!"
Great hike and view,"Steps! Sooo many steps but the hike takes only about 30 minutes each way ( depending on your level of fitness and whether or not you stop at the temple, etc) You can skip the steps and take the route on the other side. Less steps and more hiking up a mountain type feel. Check out the souvenir shop just past the bowing area/stone buddha. Over the years, I've gotten quite a few cute/cool things there "
Amazing Hike,The views were gorgeous and the top was an amazing site. There are temples off to the side and along the trail. Make sure to bring a little cash so you can buy a trinket at the top as a memory!
Gatbawi- South Korea ,A good hike. It can be challenging for some. It can be demanding in some areas. But nonetheless it was great. 
Worth the Effort,"Long hike up the mountain. Several ways up, including a less-traveled route toward the top. Use that was to see additional temples. Be sure you have a good-weather day to view the Buddha at the top. Make sure you come down the correct way or you'll wind up at the bottom on the wrong side of the mountain."
Challenge yourself to the climb,"It gets steeper as you are closer to the peak, but worth the effort. Great view from the top and the statue is one of its kind."
Gatbawi Stone Buddha,If you like stair challenges then this trip is for you! The incline on the mountain is so punishing so take water. The buddha/view from the top is still worth the hike. Be prepared to take the hour long bus ride from Daegu in order to reach it.
The best place in Korea ,"Well, I believe that this place is by far the most remembering and exiting in Korea. It situated at the top of the Gatbawi mounting, I did my best to climb there, approximately 1500 steps. But at the top you can find the Buddha statue and a lot of praying people. I'm not a Buddhist but this place is really exiting. So peaceful place, it is really crucial part of my Korea trip. I will strongly recommend everybody to visit this place. "
"This is Budda, most famous for praying. ","This is Budda, most famous for praying. You can pray when you have a big event : promotion, exam, getting a job etc. You have to clime the mountain to peak to visit here. All stairs. Nevertheless, here is very famous place. You are real Korean lover if you visit here. "
not for the weak kneed,a lot of steps but a great view from the top and a tiny buddha statue that is very old. Take water and maybe a packed lunch.
Amazing experience,"We hiked up the 1,500 stairs to the Gatbawi Buddha. Once we made it to the top it was beautiful to see all of the people praying. I highly recommend this hike. I did find it quite strenuous; however it was very rewarding to make it to the top."
A great local visit for a nationwide-reputable Buddha statue,"It's a great local place to visit for a short, easy hiking purpose. For foreigners, I think, this place will still give them a sense of Korean Buddhism cultural taste and experience related to it. Definately worth to visit any time of the year."
