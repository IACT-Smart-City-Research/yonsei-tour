A challenging hiking place,"Easy when it is at the beginning part of the mountain. However, it gets really steep and quite dangerous when reaching the summit of the mountain. Do get proper hiking equipment such as hiking shoe as sport shoe is too slippery. Spend 4 hours going up, and 4 hours down. Never climb down during the evening as it gets really dark and dangerous. Overall it was a great experience, would definitely want to go back again."
Great and challenging hiking,"Don't be fooled by the casual demeanour of the Korean hikers, and the neatness and cleanliness of their equipment. If you get up into the peaks of Bukhansan you may find yourself descending a cliff with only a steel cable or an iron bar to hold on to. Safety ropes are for sissies and westerners, apparently. But it is beautiful to be out among nature (but solitude is not guaranteed, you may find yourself in a throng of Korean hikers). I strongly recommend October to see the red maple leaves, so different than the North American maples. Some parts are accessible by subway (Dobongsan and Mangwolsa stations) and others by bus. Anything you need before (such as lunch or a forgotten item of clothing or equipment) or after the hike (such as food and beer) can be purchased between the subway stations and the mountain."
Prachtig!!,"Een van ‘s werelds populairste hiking trails is Bukhansan Mountain.Dit is een prachtig berglandschap, vlot te bereiken met het openbaar vervoer vanuit Seoul. Het meest uitgelezen tijdstip voor zijn beklimming is oktober tot november, vermits de herfstkleuren het landschap dan in een schilderachtig tafereel omtoveren.Er zijn meerdere trajecten mogelijk, doch de mooiste tocht is deze van Bukhansanseong Fortress tot aan Baegundae, de hoogste piek. Een pittige wandeling waarbij het laatste deel zelfs wat avontuurlijk is. Om de steile paden te beklimmen zijn de staalkabels die aan de rand van het pad gespannen zijn een welkome hulp. De fenomenale uitzichten van op de top maken de inspanning meer dan waard. Als het meezit met de smog krijg je een uitzicht over heel Seoul en omstreken. Wauw.Afdalen kan je langs de andere zijde van de berg, langs de oude stadsmuren. De tocht neemt zonder pauze zo’n 5uur in beslag.One of the world's most popular hiking trails is Bukhansan Mountain.This is a beautiful mountain landscape, easily accessible by public transport from Seoul. The most suitable time for his ascent is October to November, since the autumn colors transform the landscape into a picturesque scene.Multiple routes are possible, but the most beautiful trip is from Bukhansanseong Fortress to Baegundae, the highest peak. A tough walk where the last part is even more adventurous. To climb the steep paths, the steel cables that are tensioned at the edge of the path are a welcome help. The phenomenal views from the top make the effort absolutely worthwhile. If there is not too much smog you get a view of the entire Seoul area. Wow.You can descend on the other side of the mountain, along the old city walls. The trip takes about 5 hours without a break."
Baegundae Peak - worthwile,"Easy to get to the start of the hike via metro and bus (Gupabal station, line 3, exit 1 followed by 704 bus). I did the gorge path up which I understand to be slightly more difficult. Yes it was tough going, but so worth the experience at the top. I went at 8am on a Monday morning so there were very few other hikers. The most worthwhile day in Seoul!"
"Amazing view, climb not awful either","Let me get this straight, I'm not a climber and I haven't been to the gym in over 3 years. I have a decent staminia though. Not having a fear of heights was also helpful in my case.When visiting Seoul last summer, I decided to climb Baegundae peak because ... why not?I was wearing shorts, stockings and $5 primark shoes which were almost falling apart: perfect climbing gear, right? I was smart enough to pack 2L of water and lunch though. I went on a Monday I believe around 9:30 AM. The park ranger was super kind to me, but he made fun of my shoes lmao. He provided me with a map and drew a route for to climb. The first 1,5 hours up were AWFUL. I'm sure ANY other way up would have been better, but I spent the first 1,5 hours climbing uneven, very high stairs and it was almost bad enough for me to quit. During this period I only passed a couple of other people, which was really odd to me, since in other people's reviews I read that the hike is always busy.I started at the Jeongneun parking lot and made my way up to Youngchusa. This part is in the middle of the forrest and this is the part where I was just doing nothing but climbing stairs. I passed Daeseongmun and Bogungmun and this part was super nice, literally like taking a walk in the park. I decided to continue. The forrest ended and very suddenly I was confronted with how high up I was as I was on the edge of a cliff. It was very intimidating at first, but I soon got an adrenaline rush and was excited to make my way up. The next part I spent climbing on all fours over huge rocks and pulling myself up. I didn't find this hardly as draining as climbing the stairs though, and it was honestly very fun. The view from Baegundae peak is kinda unreal and it was really relaxing to sit down and eat my lunch. The locals were also super nice to me and pulled out their best english skills to have a conversation with me: why are you alone? Why are you wearing these shoes? The park ranger had told me to make my way back down to Ui-dong, which I think took me about 1,5 hours. The climb down was really nice and I came across a small shop, where I purchased some more water. There was also a traditional-style restroom which is not for the squeamish, but hey, I had to go after drinking all that water. After arriving in Ui-dong, my very sweaty self made her way back to the nearest subway station and went back to Hongdae.Over all, the walk was really nice after it was more than just climbing stairs. The view is beautiful and the adreneline rush is real. Not sure how difficult it is, since I haven't done a lot of hiking in my life, but for someone with average stamina it's deffos do-able."
A tough climb but worth the view.,"A would say you need to have decent decent footwear and I recommend padded/gripped gloves as well. In the later parts of the hike you have to climb over boulders and pull yourself up smooth rock whilst holding onto a wire rope. Gloves certainly made it easier. The views from the top are amazing, some of the best views of Seoul, and it really gives a scale of how big the city is. The down side though is getting there is a chore. The subway station that is closest is still bus ride away, and its a very popular route and you will be waiting a very long time to get on the bus. I decided to walk to the entrance to the park, which I would not recommend. Also there are multiple routes to the top, and I couldn't find any kind of visitor centre at the bottom to get a map.So when you start heading up there is no way of knowing if your are going up a harder route or an easy route. And in fact since the routes criss cross its very easy to go a much longer route. Also the ascent is mostly covered by forest so you really don't appreciate your altitude. The first time you come out of the forest you look out over a cliff and it really hits you hard. I'm not scared of heights but that sudden look over a cliff face still came as a shock. I would say its a reasonably tough climb as well. I wouldn't recommend trying to climb this unless you hike regularly."
Beautiful,It was really gorgeous. I love walking around and drowning in the beauty of nature. Fresh air and nice weather thou
You need to be fit for the climb up,"Its amazing that older Koreans of 60+ age can climb the Bukhansan mountain with ease. The climb is quite steep and rocky. The trails are not always that clearly marked out. You definitely need good hiking shoes and walking sticks will also be a great help. Don't forget to bring food and water. You can fill your water in streams on some of the trails. Toilets are few, far and minimal. Its something different to do in Seoul if you are fit for the climb."
Experience Korea,"If you like to hike, or simply take a long walk in nature while staying in Seoul, this could be the answer for you. Quite near the city . Nice views. You should bring along comfortable hiking shoes.Plan a half day; bring a snack/lunch."
Wonderful hiking ,"We are a family of four with two children (4,7). We started hiking up towards Baegundae Peak, however with the 2 kids we made it with in about 1.5k from the top. My 7 year old was fine, but my 4 year old had to be carried by daddy the further we went up. The hike was just lovely...wonderful smells, fantastic views, the nature was just gorgeous. We hiked about 4.5 hours with my kids. Stopped for lunch break (brought lunch) half way. Even if you don’t hike, I think the park is definitely something to visit to leave the hustle and bustle of the city. "
Beautiful spot...,Bukhansan National Park is a beautiful spot with spectacular views looking up and down... a nice reward during and after an enjoyable hike!
Hiking to the Peak of Baegundae Mountain,"Great mountain hiking, spectacular views over the city of Seoul and just a quick transit from the city. We can see Seoul city at the top of the Mountain but the weather just a little bit cloudy. View the weather cast before hiking up ."
Then need better maps,Brilliant hiking but quite a few climbs. We did not get lost but were never where we thought we were.Lots of friendly people. Take more water than you would expect. Easy to get to from the metro - just follow the other walkers
gorgeous views,"Spent the afternoon hiking this amazing area. Vigorous hiking, so wear good shoes. Views of Seoul are spectacular"
Fantastic hiking and great views,"For those who enjoy hiking, this is a great way to get the legs moving and see some great views of Seoul from above. I would warn that the hike is tough, so only recommended for those with hiking experience.I entered at the West side by taking the subway to Gupabal, then walking 30 mins to the park entrance (You can also take bus 704). I then hiked to the Baegundae peak via the ""easy"" route (as opposed to the ""expert"" route), then came down the mountain on the East side, eventually leading to Bukhansan Ui subway station. The whole hike took around 6 hours.Make sure you take plenty of water and snacks as there are no places to buy these after around 1km in. On the way down, there is a shop selling drinks, snacks and basic pot-noodle style meals at the Bukhansanseong fortress on the East side of the peak.Entry to the national park is free. Make sure you wear good hiking shoes as the terrain gets tough towards the top."
A great way to take a break from city touring,Wear shoes with good treads and head to the mountains. We loved our day hiking and would recommend this area to anyone who enjoys beautiful hiking trails.
"nice hike, but horrible bus driver","we did the most difficult hike, which was absolutely stunning. when we got back, we wanted to take a shuttle bus to the nearest station, like a lot of people were doing.However, when the bus arrived, only locals were allowed to enter. The bus driver literally grabbed us and pulled us away from the shuttle bus and started shouting angrily. Since we can't speak Korean, and he didn't respond in English, this Korean girl started talking with him. He wouldn't give a reason as to why we weren't allowed to join and eventually we had to walk back ourselves to the nearest station. He told us to take a cab.I guess racism isn't gone after all... If anyone knows which company this shuttle bus service belongs to, please let me know."
An amazing park right by the city,"This is an amazing park with surprisingly good hiking, that you can get to by taking the metro. It is extremely popular and basically every day there are people everywhere, but you can still enjoy a quiet hike. Note that many of the hikes, even the ones labeled Intermediate, are non-trivial. Don't assume that because you see a group of retirees while hiking that the trail is easy! It's generally steep and rocky so be ready for hills. If you have a free day and good shoes, this is totally worth doing."
Enjoyable moment,"How to go: from Gupabal station take bus no 704 to Bukhansenseong and walk in 10mins to the park entrance. Ticket fee is only 1000krw. After 35-45 mins of waking, you will choose betwen hard route and easy route. For Hard route, it's a challenging hike, quite tall and steep. On the way to Baegundae Peak, you have to climb on the steep and flat rock in the last section. But the view from the peak is amazing. Summer is too hot so I recommend you to be here in spring or autumn. When I went back, I didn't choose the same route, I chose Baegundae route, only took 1.5 hours. After get out of the park, I took bus no 120 to go to Suyu station. You should bring sthing to eat and drink (snack, water, lunch..) by urself. Total hiking and taking a rest is 5hrs (only for me). Not many foreigners hike here, most of hikers are Korean ppl, especially the middle-aged, and the elderly ppl."
Must do if you're in Seoul!,"We reached Gupabal at around 1020, took bus 704, following the people all decked in hiking outfits. Then there is a 7 minute walk to the base/ information centre. We started hiking up at about 1050 to BAEGEUNDAE peak. We probably walked about 1.5km before there was a big rest stop. Following that, there was 2 options to the peak - 2.4km advanced train & 4.1km easy trail. We kept right and went with the easy trail. Good thing about the easy trail is that it passes a long stretch of fortress walls, which was nice(pictured). We went on a non crowded day and at some points, we were the only ones on the trail and we might have gotten lost. The last ascent is quite steep and was quite challenging. But it is quite worth it!Going down, we followed a sign that said 2km to base (forgot the exact description). It was quite arduous, very steep and rocky. When we reached the base, we realised that it wasnt the same base as where we started. Instead, we had to walk a further 2km to the Bukhansan Ui station.In total, we took 3h to go up and 2h to go down. All in all, it was entirely worth it.If you can, I would reccommend bringing hiking shoes instead of trainers, or at least the grippiest pair of shoes you have. Certain routes and especially near the peak, it's mainly just walking along rocks which can be very slippery."
On top of Seoul,"I went to Bukhansan in September of 2018. It was a great experience. I was grateful that it was easy to get to the base of the trail from the subway/metro. I was 23, so I had youthful energy, but I believe it took me around 2 - 3 hours to reach the top. There were many older people scaling the mountain as well so I don't think it's a problem, and you don't feel alone doing it. Bring water, sunscreen, mosquito repellent, and snacks (basically, your standard hiking equipment)!"
A good place to forget about the hectic city.,I got on foot. I got a lot of pleasure and good photo galleries. Great views! In foggy weather visibility may be reduced. Take the road drinking water is useful.
So peaceful,My daughter and I went there and walked up the mountain. It's so peaceful and beautiful once up the mountain you can see the city .
Mangwolsa Tempel ,"Worth the clime...My condition is not perfect at all. But ones you are at the Bouda temple you forget the clime.It is perfect!In a perfect setting.As it was, originally..... not many tourists at all. Not during the week any way."
Just do it! its worth it.,"Hiking up Bukhansan mountain is not easy, especially the last 500 m or so, but it is definitely worth it. We did it with two children in tow (9 and 13 years old) and they were able to conquer the mountain. In total, it took us about 5 hours there and back. the view from the top is spectacular."
Popular among the local hikers,"I took the subway and arrived Gupabal station around 09:30hr. At the exit, there are already a group of local hikers queuing at the bus stop. They were all dressed in outdoor performance, which is part of their passion too. I joined the queue waiting for bus 704. However, when bus 8772 arrived, the local hikers were boarding the bus. I just followed suit as it could not be wrong, Entire bus is packed with hikers. Bus ride is only 10 mins ending at final stop. From the bus stop to the park entrance is a 15 mins walk. Along the way, I bought an isotonic drink from a mini mart, and kimbap, 2,500 won, from a street vendor. There is no entrance fee. At the base, there are many trails to various parts of the mountain. I just followed the crowd. Later on, I followed signs that point towards Baegundae Peak. The beginning part was easy, along well paved paths, stepping on large rocks, boardwalks as well as steel stairs. However, it got tougher with steeper incline. Towards the last 400m, I needed to use ropes, already anchored to ground, to pull myself up the granite slopes. Suggest to bring along gloves.I took about 3 hours to arrive at Baegundae peak. The summit is just a small platform with a Korean flag and a large stone inscribed with figure 836m. I needed to queue for 20 mins just to take photos, as the short stretch to the summit is narrow and single lane. After that, like all hikers, I rested just below the summit in the open space ground. I had my kimbap for lunch while enjoying the beautiful view - truly majestic, surrounded by multiple peaks against the clear blue sky. Overall, I was glad I finally managed to hike highest peak of Bukhansan National Park."
Amazing but I wish I was 20 years younger,"Amazing plants, butterflies and birds. But tough trails if you are above 55. Koreans how ever - old ladies 65+ passed us like nothing and we are reaonably fit..."
Nature so close to the city,Nice place to escape the stress of the city and breath some nice air. Recommend going witin the week.
Beautiful Hike Right Outside Seoul,"I hiked up Baegundae peak, the tallest mountain in Bukhansan National Park, on my last day in Seoul. It was completely worth it. It's quite approachable in an afternoon, but just make sure that you have OK footwear. I just wore tennis shoes, which worked OK, but I did slip and fall once on some loose rocks. It also can be quite windy at the top. The views of the surrounding park and Seoul are wonderful, and completely worth the trip if you at all enjoy hiking. It's very easy to get to Bukhansan from the metro and buses, and quite cheap too. If you're not sure you're at the right stop for the bus, it's usually quite obvious, because all the Koreans in colorful hiking gear will get off.Overall, I would highly recommend Bukhansan for anyone who loves the outdoors who is visiting Seoul. It's a very beautiful area."
Life's a climb and the view is great,"Bukhansan, B in Korean is pronounced as P ""Puk’ansan"" - Tallest Peak is Baegundae Peak at 836 m / 2,744 ft.Take Subway line 3 to Gupabal Station and get out at Exit 1. 180 degree turn around to the bus stop. Take Bus # 34/704/8772 bound for Bukhansanseong Fortress to the Bukhansan Mountain entrance bus stop (20 mins). 6 stops total, off at Bukhansan Ipgu, after Heongkuksa.‎ Sign in english in the bus. Turn left on exit of the bus, walk up to the next cross street and turn right (toward mtn). Stores along route to top up on food/drinks/gears if reqr. Can purchase a map at entrance for KRW $1000 or use sign posts and maps along the routes. At the last washroom, there is a bridge crossing the stream. Do not cross but use the dirt trail south of the stream, it's an interpretive trail (shorter & less travel) or take main trail (paved then packed). Both routes will link up near a bridge in order to cross the bridge.I returned down the other side of the mountain along the old fortress wall through Daedongmun Gate route to Akademi Info Center. Once outside the park, walk down maybe 50 m to the bus stop. Catch Bus #1 to Suyu metro station on line 4.From Bukhansanseong Info center to Baegundae Peak approx 4.3 kms. From peak to Akademi Info Center approx 4.8 kms. Time for each leg based on your fitness level and crowds on the trail(s). I did it on Friday 14 Jun starting at 1pm from the entrance. Low crowds. Enjoy!"
Peaceful ,"I have done Yeongbong Peak, it took me about 30 mins to be there. If you are new to hiking, I recommend you this peak"
Tough but fun,Bukhansan is the highest mountain around Seoul. it is quite tough if you have worked out for long time. It has beautiful steams along the trail and view from the peak is amazing!! 
Beautiful hike!,"My brother and I climbed up to the Baegundae peak, which is the highest one in the park. It was a great hike and the top was quite spectacular. However make sure to have great shoes. The last bit of the trail is very steep, sometimes slippery (even on a sunny day) and you have to pull onto ropes to climb. I could easily imagine that people who are too reckless could very well fall and seriously injure themselves! "
Great Place for Hike and Views,This is a great place to hike and enjoy some stunning views of seoul. Easily reachable from any part of seoul. Must see place in Seoul.
Great BUT,"Really easy to get to by public bus.ButIt’s serious hiking.We did a 2.5 hour one way which was uphill and over rock trails the whole way. All the locals are in hiking shoes and using hiking poles.We hoped to get away with casual shoes, but after 5 Kms taking almost 5 hours, you get a sense that it’s steep up and down. Ours was deemed one of the easier walks and classified intermediate. Would not take children or anyone with health problems.Great views, helped the aching legs.Would also mention that despite some good signage, there are many times when the path seems to have multiple options with no sign. We got lost once and discovered that many locals go off the trail on their own to find somewhere quiet. There are many options for this and so it can be hard to know what is and isn’t a trail"
"Great climb, rewarding view ","We checked out a lot of reviews and decided to climb Bukhansan based on the good feedback. It was indeed a fantastic climb with varying treks of cobbled path, stone steps, man made stairs and rock climbing. We started rather late at 1130am, but in hindsight was glad that we did as we missed the crowd entirely. The weather was perfect and didn’t get too hot at all, forecasted at 23deg. It took us just about 2hours to get to the peak. According to the iPhone health app, we climbed 200floors! Coming down though, we had read reviews about coming down the trail and getting to the Suyu Train station and was planning for that. We asked the guide at the peak which way to go and he pointed us in the direction saying it was a 1.5hr trek down. We walked for about 1hr and reached what seemed to be the base, the Begundae Information Centre, only to realise the actual base was a further 30-45minutes down a driveway road with pretty heavy traffic. The train station at this end was the Uri Station, not Suyu. We’re not sure where we went wrong as there was only seemingly 2 ways to go at the top.In any case, there are taxis that will take you down to Uri station for 1000won per person, they will even squeeze 5 passengers in to maximise their profit. At this stage we were beyond exhausted and was glad to pay that 1buck for the 5-7min car ride. So if you have to hurry and want to do this hike, our journey only took us 4hours in total including stopping for a bite and photos along the way. "
Amazing,"What a place it is truly wonderful, the views are outstanding. make sure that you stop and drink everything in."
Great trekking,"We took 2,5 hours (ca 4 km) trekking route to the peak. Good path, nice view, but also a bit challenging. I did not have any sports shoes and it was doable! Shoes have to be comfortable and reasonable sole. "
Breathtaking view of Seoul city & Nature,"It's very accessible and can reach the peak of the mountain within 2hr and 30min. The hiking course was intermediate and had tough short course before reaching the peak, but it's all worth the effort to hike to the top. Recommended to...- prepare hiking gloves for need to climb up holding to metal wire ropes- bring a bottle of (iced)water. If you prefer to hike light, there is resting area on the middle spot where u can buy iced water for ₩2,000. - small snack to nibble on as there are few amazing spots where u can eat while enjoying the amazing view. Not recommended to...- wear jeans"
Highest in Seoul,"if you want to take an excellent view of Seoul, take the challenge and climb all the way up. Follow the correct trail to get to the Baegundae peak which stands at 840m above sea level. Equip yourself with hiking gear if you want to head all the way up as there are slippery slopes near the top. Dint make it all the way up as i did not wear the correct shoes. there is no stones or steps to head to the peak when you are near 20m away."
Epic hiking,Most reviews I read talked about approaching the peak from the west side of the park. That takes a metro and bus to get to. They also talked about crowds. There are 10 entrances. I chose to enter from Dobongsan side on the east. It’s a mile from the metro stop so you can just walk there and it was very sparsely populated. Really an amazing park so close to an urban area. It’s very rocky and solid shoes are a must. 
True hiking in Seoul,"Really amazing hiking. There weren't that many flowers when I visited in early April.- The shortest route for Baegundae Summit is to start from Ui Line 'Bukhansan Ui' Station and coming back.- My recommmendation is Bukhansan Ui Station-Ui Ranger Station(Baegun Visitor Center)-Harujae-Baegunbong Ammun Gate-Baegundae Summit-Baegunbong Ammun Gate(passing)-Yongammun Gate-Doseonsa Temple-Ui Ranger Station.- Other popular starting point is Gupabal Station. So, the route of starting from here and ending at Bukhansan Ui Station is also popular.- It was more challenging than I thought. Some tracks require grabbing railings or ropes. But, if you concentrate, it's not that risky. A fatigue will be an enemy too.- For those who jump into the Bukhansan and are afraid of hiking, there are other walk-around courses called as Bukhansan Dule-gil. This is more recommended to kids and seniors."
"Excellent Hiking/Views - but ""Easy"" trail is quite tricky :(","3 adults. A lovely experience near the city, particularly if you can make it to the top! DO go to the Information Centre first where an interactive screen explains the routes - and they give you a free map. The EASY route was the 'Easiest', but still tricky for those with frail knees :( The rocky path got steeper and steeper.) This was the trail from Bukhansan National Park Visitor Centre at Jeongneung-dong. Perhaps the walking section at Sonamusup-jil is easier? but we didn't go there. However, The blossom was beautiful and the view from the top, superb!For those who use the underground system, there is a station 'Bogungmun' which is only 4 stops away on the 110A bus. Otherwise, get a taxi. About Won 5,000.Be prepared : good walking boots/sturdy trainers, hat & water bottle. :) It says no pets allowed, but I don't know about service animals? Picnic? There is a lovely, shaded 'Teahouse' at the beginning."
Amazing Hike for beginners & experienced alike,"We trekked up the Bukhansan as part of a team building activity and it surely worked. The trail starts right from the bottom (although there is a way to drive up halfway), and it starts very gently at first, with walkways past narrow streams and wooden bridges.But once you cross the Buddha temple halfway true, the 2nd half of the journey to the top is what needs more skill & teamwork.We had the added challenge of rain once we reached the top, so our journey down was even more challenging & worth the fun.Overall, the visit is a must do, for kids & adults alike, for beginners & pro climbers alike."
Majestic rocky mountain just north of central Seoul!,"This mountain is perfectly located just north of Seoul. It offers several hiking trail options but due to its height and steep gradient, it is definitely not recommended for everyone though. Some of the rocky hills are massive and truly impressive to look at. Really enjoyed hiking here for a few hours."
A Rocky Mountain for All Hikers,"Every time I am in Seoul, I always try to go hiking in Bukhansan National Park. It is easily accessible by trains and buses. This time I took Bus #704 in front of my hotel to Bukhansanseong (Fortress) Entrance. On the way it stopped at Gupabal Station, where many hikers got on the bus.Bukhansan is a rocky mountain. After the Bukhansanseong Information Center there are two choices: an intermediate course and an expert course. I chose the latter toward Uisangbong (Uisang Peak). At several places, there are steel cables to help you go up the steep granite. At some places you have a nice view of parts of Seoul.Rather than going up to Daenammun (Great South Gate), I made a loop of four hours. Near the end is Deog-am-sa (Virtuous Rock Temple), whose main hall with three Buddha statues is in a stone cave, which is the temple’s unique feature.I look forward to going on another hike at Bukhansan."
Beautiful Fall Foliage - Multiple Routes to Apex,"As an experienced hiker (for comparison, I did the longest route up and down Mt. Halla in just under 5 hours), I took the longest/hardest route to the top, which was quite fun. For less experienced hikers, there are easier and shorter paths to the top. The path I took had an area where you had to climb up rocks assisted by a sturdy rope that was installed at the top. Along the way, I found a wild snake among the rocks and saw some other animals and birds you'd never see in the city center. It was a nice escape to nature from bustling city life in central Seoul. The fall foliage was beautiful (although not quite at their peak as I went in late-September) and I imagine going here on any clear day (when the air quality is decent) would be well worth it for those who enjoy outdoor activities. The entire hike up took about an hour and another hour down with some time spent at the top and short photo breaks along the way. The trail I took was incredibly peaceful (there was literally no one else there), and I thoroughly enjoyed the solitude being in nature... until I got closer to the top, then there were a ton of other hikers :D."
Beautiful spring hike,"Bukhansan National Park is in the middle of town and with the exception of one other group, the trail to the temples was empty on a mid-Monday morning; an unexpected treat. The forest was blooming and our walk was the perfect break from the city bustle. We would have never found the trailhead without a guide but otherwise the trails are well traveled and well marked. "
This is a real hike!,"Hiking along the Seoul City Wall is very rewarding because of the stunning views to enjoy. But the path is steep and your knees should be in good condition. Take your water bottle, you will need it when temperatures rise."
Take a day to hike this mountain,"My very first hiking experience was Bukhansan, starting from Bukhansanseong and hiking up to Baegundae peak. The trails are beautiful and I got a lot of great nature shots along the way. The people I met on this hike were all very nice and friendly and when I got lost on my way down, a man volunteered to guide me all the way down and even all the way to the subway station. I had a great experience on Bukhansan."
Excellent,"Excellent place for multiple hiking trails, various difficulties.We arrived at the entrance via Dobongsan station following the flow of Korean walkers in mountain-climbing gear.We went up to Uiam rock by Gubongsa and Cheonjinsa in 1200. Ascension sportive, it must be in good condition. Lunch break on the rocks with beautiful views of Seoul and the mountains"
Need to do,"First visit to Seoul and worried due to language barrier and lack of info bubeforehand. However , it was so easy to get there. Took line 3(orange line) to Gudapal station , exit 1 and right away saw bus stop and took bus 704. You can see street signs leading to Bukhasan park and follow other hikers to get off. Park is in a suberb in very modern pretty area and gave us the feel of a ski resort village when you arrive at entrance. We went up to highest peak and found it challenging but it was totally worth it. Make sure you do carry lunch, water, hiking shoes (no tennis shoes), and flexible pants or shorts. There are temples , waterfalls , restrooms and beautiful views on way up. "
Beautiful views & perfect amount of challenge -- if you're prepared!,"MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE RIGHT GEAR -- crampons and hiking shoes as a bare minimum! The trails up to the mountains (we went up Jaunbong and Podae Peaks and stayed around the Dobongju, Podae, and Sapae Ridgelines) are manageable, but they can get dangerous if you're like us, who only had running shoes on hand. The way up from Dobongsan Station was fine, but the far side of the mountain was covered in snow, and trying to get down without gear turned into an impromptu sledding experience. No serious injuries or anything -- it was actually kind of funny -- but we had a lot of close shaves. You'll have a great time here if you do it right rather than doing it like us. Directions we took: the 1 subway line in the Soyosan direction to Dobongsan Station (it opens up to a street with clear signage and a lot of little stores that sell hiking gear, which is super helpful!). On the way back: exited via the Hoeryong Info Center, walked for around 15 min (again, signage was pretty clear & also in English), and took the 1 line in the Incheon direction from Hoeryong Station."
amazing oppertunity close to seoul city center,"amazing oppertunity close to seoul city center; if u like to hike korea is a paradis for u. From easy paved walks to more forcing tracks to challenging tours u will find everything. Korea national parks tracks are best marked and maintaned. Even u will find toilets, fitness stations, guard ropes, stairs, ... Don't expect stations where u can buy drinks or food. U shoud bring by your own."
A must visit for nature lovers and hikers,"This place is located just outside Seoul and can be reached via an hour public bus ride from Central bus station. The park is well marked and hiking up the various peaks are well directed.The hike up and down is not easy with medium level of difficulty. Certain areas are accessible with the help of ropes or chains.There are many streams and floral scenes along the way.The view on top , at about 1000 m above sea level, is awesome with a good 360 degree view of the surroundings and distant view of Seoul. "
A mind blowing hike just outside of Seoul,"Bukhansan national park can be reached by taking subway line 3 to Gupabal Station. If you get out at Exit 1, you can take bus 704 to Bukhansanseoun Fortress. The main peak is called Baegundae peak which takes quite a bit of effort to get toWe came during low season in the middle of winter (it was -14 degrees celcius at the time!). Although it was super cold, there were still quite a lot of hikers during the day. We recommend bringing ample food and drink on the way up as you will struggle otherwise. Whilst it was the dead of winter we did not encounter snow on the day, and i think were there snow, this hike would have been a lot harder. There are many intermediate and beginnner paths, but to get to the main peak, you will need to walk through difficult and what looks quite extreme for the average walker. I do quite a lot of hikes during my holidays but the final 30m or so is no piece of cake. There are metal cables attached to metal poles in the mountain side and parts of it requires all your strength to get up. During the peak season, i assume you may need to wait around to get up as you will have hordes of tourists trying to come the opposite direction. You may be greeted by families of mountain cats at the topBe prepared for extreme wind up there!One tip we learned was to make sure you have ample time to come down. It took a bit longer to descend due to the steepness and if you descent the way you came up, you will catch the afternoon sun. Make sure you reach the paved path before nightfall as there is very little light pollution on the mountain paths and you will struggle if it is pitch black!"
Be prepared for a mighty full day workout!,"Good hiking shoes, sticks and gloves are highly recommended. Not suitable for children. There no proper tracks - rocky roads, stoney slippery road, and also fallen leaves making it slippery. Water and snacks are necessities.The scenery is breathtaking once you are up there, but do train up a little before attempting this ""hike"" which is more like a mountain climbing."
 Need a full day & hiking sticks ,You can buy hiking sticks for USD5 on the way to the entrance & I highly recommend you do.National parks in Korea are not for the faint hearted! We only did the very short walk to the closest view point because we’ve been hiking at Busan & Gyeongju & also only allocated a couple of hours here. It takes 1hr by train from Seoul to get here. 
Beautiful,Pack accordingly and bring money. Not for people with poor health. This is a popular place for Koreans and tourists. 
Baegundae Peak,"Amazing views and excellent work out. Things I'm glad we brought up the mountain: water, snacks, good hiking shoes, winter hat because it gets very windy, walking stick and gloves. For the gloves, you don't necessarily need them for warmth but to pull yourself up, using the steel ropes. I've read that people have gotten blisters and the gloves really helped. Be prepared for some very slippery, flat rocks. We took the city bus there and had no issues. Highly recommend this for anyone visiting Seoul!"
Youngbong and baekundae,The trek up youngbong and down took 4 hours with a good sized group including a short stop for lunch. Adding the trek to the peak of baekundae was an additional 90 minutes. It was difficult in some areas due to the ice and snow. Most people had crampons on their shoes which were beneficial but not 100% necessary. It could be done without them but people were slipping a little and you had to hold on. It’s a beautiful hike with great views. 
Good workout,"Manageable climb to the peak. Took about 1h45m to 2h to ascend. Unable to estimate the time needed to descend as I fell and sprained my ankle just after leaving the peak. Due to the rocky terrain, recommend wearing high-cut hiking boots and also walking stick. Otherwise, it was a good solo experience and awesome view at the peak. It was windy (at the peak) and cooling hike in early Sep 2018."
For mountain lovers,"A lot of amazing trails to choose from to get up one of the many peaks. Many spots to stop along the way to admire the view, but the true reward is when you finally reach one of the peaks."
A Seoul Must-Do Experience,absolutely stunning views. i did the hike with 2 good friends. it took us 2.5 hours to hike up and about 3.5 to come down. Go earlier in the day so the path isn't crowded and the line at the top of the mountain (to take a photo with the flag at the top) isn't long.
Fun day out with a 4 hour hike,"We chose to do the peak trail and inadvertently picked the difficult trail. It is quite steep up and then down but worth the calorie burning trek. I wouldn’t call this a typical bushwalk or hike as much of the walk s actually climbing over rock.They don’t kid you when they say that HIKING boots are recommended. We have normal sneakers and there were some parts that were quite difficult. As you get closer to the top, it gets much more difficult with the last 300 odd metres to summit literally climbing up steep rock with ropes to pull yourself up.If you are afraid of heights, you may not be able to summit as it is not completely fenced off. Calves were hurting for days afterwards but worth it."
Tough but rewarding,"Took the subway and followed another hiker to a nearby bus-stop, where, by this time, was already over-flowing with local hikers. Admittedly, it was a Sunday and it was a choice day, since hiking alone, my preference is to encounter hikers along the way.I made it to the peak, and boy, was it tough! I wasn’t expecting snow/sleets and had to walk gingerly as I was devoid of crampons. Definitely worth the hike as one could view downtorn Seoul from the top! The hike itself was satisfying, as with all other mountains, is never short of scrambling over huge boulders - rope and support handles were aptly anchored."
Surprisingly challenging hike,"Amazing escape from the city. Temples, ancient gates and walls and the serenity of nature. Big enough for several days of hiking."
Stunning but not Easy!,"I got to Bukhansan National Park from the metro and hopped on a bus to the park entrance. My goal was to make it to the top of Baegundae (Peak), boy it was not an easy hike! I am fit and hike a lot and absolutely enjoyed every minute of the thrill getting to the top. The views were absolutely stunning, and some of the historical markers along the trail were fascinating. There were a few spots where I accidentally left the trail, signage was rare in some spots. Toward the top, it gets very rocky but there are cables to hang on to. Once at the top, you can see the whole city and surrounding area. Bonus, there are a few friendly kitties at the top that can't wait to get their photos taken! The views and experience was well worth the effort to the top. There are several trails near the entrance but to reach the peak, I would not recommend it for kids or others that are not physically fit, just being honest. I was here in October, I hit the fall leaves at the perfect time. Bukhansan National Park was my highlight of Seoul, superb experience!"
Great escape from the city,It is great place to get back to nature. Many locals visit this place to keep their body fit and here and there you would find foreigners who would travel there to have a hike for their lifetime. Park itself is the standout among Seoul or nearby parks. Hike is pretty intense where you find certain place thet you have to have certain rock climbing experience.
Amazing hike up a mountain less than an hour from downtown Seoul,"Bukhansan National Park has trails for all levels of hikers. Trail maps accurately indicate the level of effort required and trails are clearly marked in English and Korean. Our guide kept us moving at a comfortable pace for our small group of 4 and we were able to go to one of the peaks (Baegundae Peak) and down in 5 1/2 hours with a few very short breaks (including a lunch). Even if you don't climb to a peak, the views at various points along the way are spectacular. If you like hiking, then you should not miss this opportunity when in Seoul. Make sure you have proper footwear as you will need it to climb the rocky trails and the peak. And give yourself ample time to come back down in daylight. (We were there at the end of Oct)"
Thrilling yet compelling,"After researhing this hike, we were confident to go for it, but got lost along the way. First of all, for some reason, bus 8772 never arrives. we took bus 34 and we double check with the driver. secondly, we waited at wrong bus station, be sure to ask. it is opposite exit 3. so ya we arrived and around noon and follow the thrail yet again to wrong peak, U-turn and went along the ""water-fall"". if the fall is on your left, you are on the right track. after we reach one of the ""temple"", we realised alot of locas actually drive there (at this point, we really wish we knew) and start the real ascend up. this will take you at least 2hrs. we had a little adventure oursself when we trek till the night, bcos of my wife injuries and with 2 kids. Be warn and please do take extra precaution for all this emergency and prep touchlight, rope and first-aid, also water to last, caneed food in case. ANOTHER WARNING is the top 50m up with steel rope is really not for the untrained or kids. its really scary as theres no safety line and the slope can be 70degree steep and no climbing accessories and its a long way down...."
just 25 min by subway from heart of Seoul,"Just 25 min by subway from heart of Seoul. To take to the top of Baekundae it will take about 3,5 h (up only). After hiking there are some nice local restaurants near subway to enjoy Korean barbecue."
Heaven on Earth,"If you like nature, this is a must visit in Korea. Seriously. I went during the peak season in autumn. It was a bit crowded near the entrance and as well as for the cable car, but once you hike higher, there were less and less people. The view once you are up top is AMAZING. I went there for 3 days and hiked to 3 different spots: Ulsanbawi, the cave and the waterfall. Each has different beauty. Do expect the koreans hiking with K-Pop music and walking stick and super delicious hiking meal. I would suggest you to bring a proper meal instead of just sandwich or onigiri."
Nice but busy,Worth jumping on the metro and then getting a local bus. Lovely park. Especially nice in the autumn as the leaves change colour.
Bukhan=North Korea San=Mountain,"On Saturday morning, I woke up and decided to climb Bukhansan Mountain. I took the subway to Gireum Station (Line 4, exit 3) and took the bus 110B and got off at the last stop. I then looked for the mountain and headed towards it!It was a gorgeous fall day. Not busy. Saw some older Korean people taking pictures and babies pondering their future. There are many trails and is not over strenuous. Worth the trip and a good way to get your step count up."
Beautiful sightseeing.,"A large park on a high hill with a tower from which you can have fantastic views of the city. I wish they had made a  walking trail separate from the motorway, which could be used for a pleasant walking from the city to the park."
Beautiful!,"One has to climb with cable ropes a lot to get to the peak, but it worth it! I think this is a must have, while you are in Seoul. During autumn, it has beautiful colors, and there are several trails to take, each one has a very nice scenery. "
Such amazing views!,"Loved this park, wish I had more time to explore. The hike was not as easy as we thought but it was worth it. So lovely..."
Fantastic experience in Seoul,"We had a fantastic day hiking in Bukhansan National Park. We loved the convenience of being able to get the metro to a national park, it's so accessible! The park is beautiful and it's full of locals out hiking, making the most of the gorgeous park. We went on a weekday in Autumn when the leaves were changing colour and it was a little crowded, but not too crowded."
Awesome Hike up to Baegundae Peak!,"Visited the park on 2nd November morning. Rocked up early @ about 7.15am to avoid the crowds. Had a friend who so kindly drove me to the trailhead so I cannot share on the public transport to the trailhead. I wanted to get up to Baegundae Peak so i started the hike at Bukhansanseong Information Centre.Restrooms available for use before you start so no issues there. The shops were not opened yet so if planning to start early, pls bring along all your food/water/equipment and don't hope to pick everything up here before your hike!The trail was well marked, with signs showing you where to go to get to the peak. Difficulty: - starts off easy with slight inclination and well paved. - hard to get lost all the way through right up to the peak. - trail gets difficult as you progress. as you get close to the peak, you will need the help of the metal ropes to pull yourself up the rocks. the rock face can be quite slippery even in great weather when i was hiking up. i can imagine it would be very difficult if it was raining. - Rocks are large and vertically challenged pple (like me ha) really need to scramble and pull yourself up and over. - Overall: moderate difficulty. Shoes:- trail /hiking shoes advised. Views:- absolutely awesome! was treated to fall colours all the way through the hike. =) made the workout worth it! I believe there are several ways up to the this peak. I came down the mountain via another route and ended up at the Bukhansan National Park Ui Ranger Station (followed signs for 'Ui Descent Route') and walked to the Bukhansan Ui Train Station and took the train back to the hotel=)A Definite MUST DO while in Seoul!"
"Intense Hike, Amazing View",By the time we were done my step tracker said we'd walked 16.75km. The majority of the trail is large rocks that you must scramble over. This is a strenuous hike. We didn't see any water filling stations on the trail so definitely make sure to bring water with you. Bathrooms are very limited so plan ahead.The views at the top are well worth the hike. It was breath-taking. There is also plenty of open rock front at the top for people to stop and have a break. 
Nice! Difficulty depends on your hike,"Will be providing a long review as I found the information online kinda confusing and not too much of info. So hoping this review will be able to help anyone who is going at this time. I went in late October (on a Sun) as it was known to be one of the nicest view in Autumn. I reached Gupbal station, exit 2 and took bus 8772 (though online mentioned 704, but I followed the crowd). Temperature is around 11 degree when I starting to hike at around 12.30pm. Contrary to what other people said online, there wasn’t as many people as mentioned. Probably ‘cause I started quite late. Apparently there will have a few paths available to hike. Easy, intermediate and expert. I don’t understand Korea language, but I just wanted to reach to the highest peak - Baegundae.So basically there are few mountains in Bukhansan National Park. The highest stands at 832m which is the Baegundae peak, and also I believe might be the hardest as well. From the starting point, the distance is somehow 4.5km to the peak. I took about 3.5 hours to reach to the peak. Oh let me side track awhile to talk about my dress code. I wore an inner shirt and pants, on top with a t-shirt and hiking pants, followed by a Columbia hiking jacket. Shoe, is just a normal sport shoe. I wanted to bring light, otherwise would recommend wearing a hiking shoe for a better grip. Brought a pair of gloves as well (would say this a must).Well.. the beginning 2 hours, likely you will feel hot instead. Somewhere in the middle of the hike... it suddenly rain and was raining ice cubes instead of droplets. It was then very cold and windy as well. The tough part begins at around 1.5km to the peak. Where they steep slopes and for me, I have to rely much on the wired poles or using my hands to pull myself up (gloves comes in super handy and it was cold). Furthermore, the slopes were kinda of slippery especially with a sport shoe. Many times I thought I might couldn’t make it back. Talking about coming down... there will be a fortress (about 300m before the peak). There’s two ways to go down. One is how you came up (for me it will be a 4.5km down), and the other is 1.8km down to the information center (apparently there’s many ways to come up depending on where you starting). So logically, I took the 1.8km down. It took about 30 mins to the information center but you will need to continue to walk about 20 mins to reach to the subway which is the Bukhansan UI station. ConclusionApparently, there’s a shorter alternative to go up to the peak which should takes like about 2 hours. Regardless, at the last between 600m and 300m, it will be tough. Parents need to supervise and pay many attention to children if they going for this highest peak. I find is not a joke when it rain. That aside... the whole hiking trail is so nice~"
Stunning,"I visited here from Dobongsan metro station, which avoided an extra bus journey. It was a perfect place to do the trekking to over 700metres. The climb towards the end was not easy, but so worth it. The views on the trek was incredible. One of my best days out ever. I joined the tradition of the Koreans and drank thier rice wine on the day. Lovely drink it is too. Highly highly highly recommended."
Not an easy stroll,"I'd read that this was a picturesque, popular weekend walk for locals, but was very surprised to find that climbing the summit is an all day, strenuous adventure. My teenage daughter's & I are keen walkers, but it was unexpectedly challenging for us, so I was very glad we'd brought enough water and had the right clothing. It is incredibly picturesque at every turn, with the side steps to temples and statues well worth it. The summit portion was actually quite frightening with quite a crowd holding onto cables embedded in the sheer rock, hoping no one above us took a tumble. An exciting adventure, with a magnificent view at the top, but not for children."
wonderful,"Beautiful nature, nice walk until the top. you don't have the feeling to be next to Seoul. view is just no words for. if you love nature, you should go hinking in the nat. park"
beautiful park and very accessible from downtown,"I recommend coming here as early as possible. It is a large park and best visited 2 times (once for the east side and once for the west side). If you only come once, the west side is more attractive. The east side was mostly grueling and not enjoyable due to the rocky trails and gnats everywhere. It is rare for me to want a hike to end but I was relieved to finish. Fortunately, I went to the west part later and it was excellent. Trails are much easier overall (only a small portion was rocky). It is steep to get to the top so bring enough water. The views are fantastic from the top. My regret was not starting earlier the 2nd trip since I had to skip part of the park. I would definitely visit the western part again. The guide warned about crowds but due to record breaking heat and it being a weekday, it was not too crowded. I read to avoid autumn weekends though. "
Beautiful scenery,"Well worth the trip!As a recommendation, take the train to the end of the line at Bukhansan Ui (light green). I can’t recall the exit number, but there is a bus depot around 50m from the station, and there is a free shuttle bus that will take you to the entrance for the hike to the peak. It was much more convenient than the route that we took which led to Dobong where we then had to hail a taxi. We found this shuttle bus on the way back so hopefully it works both ways!"
Amazing views,"We came here to do some hiking and get away from the city center for a day. We didn’t really have a plan and didn’t make it to the highest peak, but got some amazing views of the city from the route we took. We didn’t start our hike until after midday, so it was almost 6 when we came down. I would recommend starting a little earlier in the day. This is definitely a great way to spend the day in Seoul! "
A very enjoyable hike for all ages.,"A very enjoyable hike, You will see people ranging from 5 years old to 80. Koreans love to hike. There is not a tram to the top, so schedule between 4-8 hours to hike to the top and back down. More than 18 km of trails."
Moderate hike,This is a beautiful hike with moderate challenge. The view is just magnificent and and the trail is also clean. There were mostly koreans and they were super fit. I hike twice a week and even I found it moderately challenging.
stunning place,"if u want to do something a little different u must go here, theres different routes depending on your experience and level of fitness and the views are outstanding all the way up i couldnt recommend it enough. dont worry about food and drinks when u get to the start of the mountain range theres loads of shops to get everyhing from snacks drinks to hiking gear. but make sure you wear proper hiking shoes and take a bag with standard hiking equipment as this is a proper mountain range and you dont want to get caught out "
5h Walk from the Metro and Back,"Fantastic views with some strenuous bits. Mainly I the forest until you reach the mountain where you need to do some climbing. Take a hoodie for the top it gets cold.Metro is 30min walk away from the start of the walk. It always go up.For the way back take a different route going around the mountain. Take Maps.me with you because the park indications are quite bad, it will stop showing your main route after a while. Pay attention some names sounds the same but are totally different."
Worth going to the peak,"The trail is easy to follow on the trail map and is also in English. The trail starts out easy to go to the summit, but evolves to a moderate rock climb. Hiking boots are recommended for the portion of the trails that take you to the summit with the Korean flag at the top. There are many trails, but this is just the experience that i had. Bring a backpack with water and food to eat on the flat stone when you reach the top. Remember there be many others on this trail as it is very popular."
"So close to Seoul Metro, but feels like world away.","During my last visit to Seoul with my wife, we decided to hike Bukansan National Park. Getting to the park/mountain was super easy via metro/subway then one bus ride to the entrance of the park. Though the path is well marked, and signs are clear, please keep in mind that it's pretty strenuous hike if you wish to get up to the top/summit. I hike on a regular basis in Colorado (various trails in the Rockies), I have to say I was pleasantly surprised at the level of difficulty. If you're not in shape or would prefer an easier route, please choose a beginner route, but keep in mind that final .5KM or so is difficult no matter what path you take as it involves climbing up the granite face. However, there are metal ropes that will assist you. I highly recommend this great treasure. I plan to visit again during my next visit. "
Awesome Climb and View,"Climbed up Baegundae Peak through the valley route. Takes about 3hours and the climb is no joke. The difficulty level gets higher the nearer you are to the peak. The view at the top is breathtaking. You can choose the same way back or take another route - Ui Dong route (which i did and its way easier). You will exit the other gate of Bukhansan.You get get a map for 1000KRW ar the front gate.You gotta make sure you pack enough water and perhaps energy bars. Use hiking shoes instead of normal shoes. The track is really a kill on normal shoes. You will be stepping on rocks of various shapes and sizes.Directions:- Gubapal Station- Exit 1- Bus 8772 (lesser stops) or 34 (lots of stops)Alternatively, there is a new line UI Trans (grey line) at the top of the train map. You can find two stations for Bukhansan.From what i know, the trails are closed from15 Feb - 15 May01 Nov - 15 Dec"
Nice day trip with an amazing view,"Seoul may not market itself as a place for casual hiking which is a pity. Because within an hour from Seoul city, there is this gorgeous hiking trail that has an amazing view when you reach the peak. Great to spend a day out ouf the city without having to travel for hours to get there. "
Not one to do in Summer,"Will probably return back to this park in another season other than Summer. It is really not for the faint of heart. We made our journey there by bus and it was so incredibly hot. We also saw other hikers who were pretty much geared for the climb, with hiking poles and backpacks. We weren't geared up as much and so we decided not to attempt the summit. If you do plan to go, bringing lots of water is important! "
National Forest,"The name of the park stands for ""big mountain in the north"". It has dozens of granite peaks and is great for hiking across the numerous valleys. Expect to spend at least half a day here."
Great hike!,"The stunning view from the top of Baegundae is indeed worth the long hike! The hike takes approx. 5 hours, from the very bottom to the top and back, including stop at the temple. Bring plenty of water and good shoes!"
Top of The Hill,Check out the view to appreciate the entire city of Seoul & look into the hills to see military bases and equipment all around
Great view and not too crazy climb,"It took me around 2h 20m to reach the top inclusive of resting. Coming down is around the same duration as you got to move downwards slowly. Really nice view! I went on a Monday and was expecting a huge crowd since this is the day most museums are closed, but there were just sporadic hikers along the way. It is pretty steep and rocky but nothing too crazy. Wouldn’t recommend this for young children though."
Worth the effort!,"I looked for an accurate time for the hike to baegundae peak and found conflicting reports. I am a steady but not serious walker and it took me 2.5 hours up and 1.5 hours down. The signs can be a big misleading as lots seem to sign for the peak - I actually went wrong and ended up at another peak meaning I lost time to descend from that and then walk up to begundae - so it may well be less that 2.5 hours up. The last km or so is quite challenging with big boulder steps and the climb to the summit involves using wired fences - these are safe but you will need a head for heights. The flag at the top is the ultimate photo spot. The walk wasn’t that busy and I often didn’t see anyone - unusual that this was a Saturday but may be it was too hot. This was my second walk in South Korea - first was uksanbawi Rock- begundae was higher, more challenging but also more spectacular!"
"Crowded, but worth the quick trip out of the city","Especially beautiful in the Autumn, though there are crowds, everyone is pleasant and it's a really nice way to enjoy the space a little outside Seoul. Just beware of American and Chinese tourists, they're the only rude ones and they will embarrass you by playing weird loud music and trying to knock you off the mountain."
Great hike!,"We chose BUKHANSANSUNG course and it took us roughly 5 hours to complete the hike (round trip). Do bring food and plenty of water as there is no food/water once you start the hike. Also bring along mosquito repellant as there are many mosquitos at the foot of the mountain. The last part of the hike to the peak was very challenging due to the steepness and we had to climb up via the ropes. Thankfully, we read some of the reviews that the ropes can be quite painful and brought anti-slip gloves (we bought a cheap one from Daiso costing 1000 won for 2 pairs). We ate kimbap at the peak while enjoying the stunning view. Recommend!"
Dangerous hike for an awesome view,"Planned a hike to the mountains and it was really enjoyable. We were a group of beginners and did not have any special equipment for the hike. Went on a pretty rainy day, so it wasn't very suitable for climbing, however, we did manage to reach one of the peaks. Ended up on the advanced trails which was very steep and physically challenging. The rain didn't help since it made the rocks very slippery and there were a few portions of the trails that were very dangerous especially in the rain. Overall, the experience was worth it because the view was awesome. Be sure to check the weather forecast before planning the trip and also be sure to know the route you are heading towards."
good for hiking as it near with seoul but getting good view of it,not so far from seoul taking metro & one of good hiking place in korea. i love the view & overall environment. not so tourism place but getting many local people to do the hiking. spend a day to do it esp for autumn. that was quite beautiful & peaceful place. love it.
Great place to go for hiking...,"Went here today and thank god there was no rain. The hike wasn’t bad but it was very hot. We didn’t make to the big Buddha and I was looking for that but didn’t know how far we should go. :( We stopped at the first temple & that was about it. Overall, to me the hike was bad. Make sure to bring a few bottles of water, sunblocks, & mosquitoes spray. Wear tennis shoes or hiking shoes. "
Mount climbing with Metro in a half day in the center of Seoul,"Where you can enjoy mountain climbing in half day by subway in Seoul city,If the weather is not cloudy, you can see Seoul at the top of the mountain."
Amazing views,"Absolutely amazing views. We went on a Monday, since other landmarks tend to be closed this day. Though the hike was by no mean easy (and I hike regularly!) the views at the top were amazing. To get the full view, you'll need to go on a clear sunny day. But make sure to bring plenty of water, as it gets quite hot and the hikes are not casual. Some of the paths have vending machines / stalls selling water and the entrance has many sporting goods stores and cafes to help you prepare for your hike, or recover afterwards."
We summited,"Awesome hiking experience to the top of the Bukhasan mountain which is 832 meters altitude. Took around 2 hours from the small village before the entrance to the national park. we took the expert gradient route, which has an average ascent steepness of around 25 degrees but at time it felt more like 50%. Hike down took around one hour maximum. Although very hot and sweaty to climb up, have a warm pullover for the top as it is rather cool up there. "
Very nice hike to the higest point in Bukhansan national park.,"It is a good and fun hike. Unfortunatly the route is not that exciting as I hoped it to be. Furthermore, the hike was not that difficult either. At the end it becomes a big challenging, in sense of steepness. Therefor, I would not recommend to do this hike with small children, 14+."
Fantastic experience but come well prepared,"I went here at the end of my Seoul trip to hike the Bukhansanseong trail (the most popular trail) to Baegundae Peak, a bit overconfident and with no actual hiking gear and no prior hiking experience and with no hiking partner and just slightly above average fitness level. I did bring 4 bottles of water and walking shoes with decent grip though. It was definately doable, but I would highly suggest that you bring actual hiking shoes, gloves, plenty of water, a snack, sunscreen and maybe some insect spray if you visit during summer like I did. Why? Because near the top the the sun is scorching, and the rocks you climb are smooth and slippery and you have to drag yourself up with steel wires that can hurt your hands without gloves. And near the bottom of the mountain are plenty of mosquitoes and some Giant Asian Hornets (can actually kill humans if stung many times). All that said, this truly is an unforgettable experience with some awe inspiring scenery and views and I would highly recommend it if you're well prepared.Getting to the Bukhansanseong Trail: Take subway line 3 and get off and Gupabal exit 4 and go to the bus stops in front of you and take bus 34, 704 or 8772 to Bukhansan Ipgu (it shows on the display at the front of the bus). When you exit, go left in the direction the bus was going and take the next right turn and keep going forward until you see the park information booth on your left near a Bukhansan National Park sign (where you can buy a map for 1000 won if you want).And if you don't want to backtrack, like me, you can take the Daedongmun Gate route back down after reaching Baegundae Peak. To access that route, backtrack past the stone gate near the peak and go down the stairs a little bit until you see a split, where you take a left turn and keep following the signs for Daedongmun (Gate). Keep in mind that this route is a bit longer and has some additional uphill hiking, but you get to walk along the Bukhansanseong Fortress wall and after crossing the Daedongmun Gate there will be some very beautiful creaks and views. Many more mosquitoes here than the previous route though so keep that in mind. After getting down this route at the Academy Park Information Center you will have a bus stop just past the info center on your right side, for bus number 1, which you can take to Suyu station, where you can take subway line 4 back to Seoul Station.This hike took me in total 5 hours at a brisk pace with only short water and photo breaks. 2 hours to the peak, and 3 hours down (including a 20 min stop at the peak). Skipping the Daedongmun route, and backtracking instead would probably be a bit faster going down."
Enjoyable and worth the bus ride from Seoul ,Went to climb Ulsanbawi (pardon the incorrect spelling) with a friend from Seoul. The hike itself was easy at the start but gets harder with the steep stairs and strong wind towards the end. The view at the top was spectacular and I really enjoyed the hike and views along the way. There are restaurants at the bottom of the mountain. (Apparently it is Korean tradition to eat the Korean pancake and drink alcohol at the end of a hike). Make sure you wear something warm and put on appropriate sun protections. 
Steep hike with cables up Mt Beagundea,"* Nice hike up highest peak in the Seoul area - Beagundae 836m* Top section involves scrambling on rock with fixed cables for security, some may find scary, others may find easy* Round trip took up about 5 hours, including 1/2 hour at summit* See attached image for GPS track, we came down a longer and perhaps more interesting and less used route. All the tracks are pretty well marked and you can get a map (we paid 1000) at the park information office.* No fee or permits required to hike (unlike Taiwan)* Loads of gear shops near at the start of the route, and a few places where you can buy drinks and snacks * We used bus number 704 to get there from city (every 12 mins, about 1200 won each way, use a TMoney card)"
"Intensive climb to Baegundae, worth it for the views","The park is a nice trip out of the hustle of Seoul but gets busy as well. We hiked to the top of Baegundae on a nice sunday morning and while probably every senior citizen of Seoul was hiking at the same time, the crowds were not a big issue. Only for the last 300m which are narrow and steep whilst you have to hold on to chains and ropes, there was a lot of traffic. We took the one of the less traveled routes down. The park is easy to hike since there are signs and well connected to public transport."
Baegundae (highest peak in Bukhansan),"One of the toughest challenges i have ever faced. This hike is about 836 metres high up a number of tough terrain trails of rocky steps, travel slopes, forest trails, slope rope climbs and wooden staircases. The whole hike involves a range of categories from amateur to expert and can take 1hr 30mins to 2hr 30mins to climb to the top. There are some stunning views (unfortunately my climb was on a smog day) and there is more than one trail and other peaks. You can do some rock climbing or mountain biking if you don't want to go hiking. Also it is tradition to have a drink of Makgeolli (Rice Wine) at the top of the peak so don't forget."
Wonderful view of Seoul ,The view of Seoul on a clean day is definitely worth the hike. The last part of the Baekundae peak's hike requires hiking shoes although I've seen people wearing sneakers. Be careful when going down as it can be slippery. On the way up there is a toilet and a place where you can buy icecream :) 
Well worth a visit!,"Bukhansan isn't the most straight-forward place to visit (a subway ride and decent length bus ride are both required), however it is well worth it for the best outdoor walks close to Seoul. There are a large amount of tracks that range in difficulty from very easy, to medium-hard, with all sorts of different lengths (both time and distance). Be careful visiting in winter though as it can be deceptively dangerous and hard."
Breathtaking,"Two ladies on their rubber shoes tried to climb this majestic mountain and it did fill their eyes with awe and admiration on the view, the trees, the stones, the trails, the streams and the locals. It was not an easy hiking for a beginner but since we decided to climb the mountain we stop after 1.4 km away from the peak. No need for guide just follow the trails and the locals who are hiking, they will guide you also which way to climb. Free entrance and you need to carry your water and snacks if you havent had a full meal before the climb. There are easy and hard trails. Its was tiring but you can stop anywhere to admire the view and catch your breath. We went just after the rain and i was expecting to be slippery but its not. Just beware of small worms hanging on a spider strands along your way. Its cold and windy when we climb so be prepared with your clothes. Not sure during summer. Overall i would like to climb it again to the peak if had another chance. We stayed in myeongdong and we took taxi going there as the fair is the same with both of us taking the bus. We saw buses doing in and out near the park. Hiking gears was all around before going. "
A bit more like Cliffhanger than we were expecting!,"Expect some exercise with this venture into the park!Very popular with locals on a weekend, all decked out in their active wear and hiking poles.The first hour has a paved path that will take you up past a number of temples, and their are other tracks of varying difficulty as well. Very pleasant experience, with babbling brooks and other natural beauty.You can then venture up further to the ... wall or if you are really brave, up to the one of the peaks.Once the paved path ends, the path gets a lot more ambiguous, for example 15min before the shelter on the way to the Begondae peak the paths non existent and you are just walking through trees. Thankfully there should be a big enough stream of locals to follow. Tracks and stairs do eventually come back though.We decided to go to the Begondae peak and around 1km to go (approx 700m altitude) things start getting pretty hairy. My husband tapped out around this time when we got to the point where only a steel pole and cable was between you and a sheer 100m+ drop. The space also gets quite limited around here as people are traversing in both directions. That said, there were plenty of locals in their 60s and active wear with apparently no fear plodding their way up towards the peak. Even at this point, the view across Seoul was amazing.All in all a great experience, albeit a little hairier than we expected. You have been warned!"
Calmness and nature just next to the city,"If you want to get out of the sparkling city of Seoul to feel some fresh air and the nature around you, Bukhansan is probably the fastest way as it's literally right next to the city."
Amazing hiking right in Seoul,"I happened to be able to go hiking in Bukhansan on a Wednesday by myself. In Seoul, having anyplace that is not crowded is an amazing luxury! In addition, weather was a perfect 60 degreees F, skies were crystal clear and the spring was just blooming everywhere. I wish I could have done more--but climbing up Wonhyobong Peak was enough for me--it took about an hour and change, plus a little extra to look around. Coming down was a lot faster (duh). Apparently there was a waterfall on the other side but I didn't do my research on the trails and so forth, so I missed it. Trails are not that clear at the bottom/park entry, but once you get on a path it is well-maintained and not hard to follow."
Beautiful mountain just 30 mins from Seoul,My husband and I love to hike and were glad that we kicked started our Seoul trip by hiking this mountain. We loved every minute of it and wish we could spend more time here.The views here are incredible from picturesque streams to gorgeous blossoms. We can't wait to come back here again on our future trips to Seoul.
A Spectacular Trail for Intermediate Hiker,"As we get used to hike a mountain in Hong Kong, this time around we wanted to try hiking in Seoul and we found Bukhansan as it is quite close to Seoul. It takes us about 35-40mins by bus from Hansung University area. Our starting point was Bukhansanseong up to Baegundae peak, the highest in Bukhansan and most well known. The first 1hour was pretty much fine , it was mostly flat path and stairs to go up and down. Then it started to change as we went up more and more, it was kinda tough as it took us to keep climb up the mountain and it has a rocky terrain. We spent about 3.5hrs to reach the peak with a bit of rest here and there. It is important to pack up your lunch and water as you can enjoy the view on the top while u have ur lunch. As we hiked in Spring time when the weather still pretty much milder, it will be more difficult during Summer time as the weather gonna be super hot and u may need more water. You may also need a hiking stick especial when you go down !!! Unfortunately, we didn't bring any as it was quite tough for my knee to keep going down without any helping tools. In total we spent about 5hrs from starting point to ending point (Bulgwang Station). Please note that is better to wear sport shoes as we saw some people wearing converse or Adidas Superstar which is not suitable at all for the terrain if u want to reach up the peak. "
Amazing hiking destination!,"Seoul is a highly underrated destination for hikers. There are lots of fantastic hikes of various grades with stunning views! Living in Seoul, I hike in both spring and fall. There are hundreds of different trails, ranging from easy to quite strenuous. On a clear day, you are treated to a mixture of city and mountain views. There are often bathrooms, exercise parks, badminton courts, benches, pavilions and more along the way. One trail even has complimentary bug spray. Another has hammocks (not Bukhansan National Park I don't think...it was a trail near Seodaemun). Seoul's hiking is one of my favorite things about the city, and not one that many people expect to find in this concrete jungle. However, it's very fast and easy to find yourself at the base of a hike from many parts of the city. "
Good place for hiking ,"A really nice place for hiking if you're in Seoul. It'll take about 2 hours to go to top of the mountain. I went alone in a Sunday and there I met one of the locals and he helped to understand the trails. Also, there're signals to direct you though the trail and tell you about the distances either you going up or down. "
Great view and easy to hike ,I decided to go on this adventure with my boyfriend and I didn't regret it. Since I come from a city surrounded by mountains I was quite impressed by the view. It is indeed easy to hike and it can be done by people of any age. What I loved the most were the Buddhist temples and the Fortress combined with the peaceful atmosphere. 
nice hiking tour,"As it was my third time in Seoul, I decided to go exploring outside the city. I went hiking in this NP. At arrival at the subway station, just follow the locals ;-). At the NP gate, a ranger came directly to me to explain in English how to fo to one of the peaks, and gave me a map in English. Only confirming my experience with Koreans: very helpful and enjoyable people."
Easy hike,"Bukhansan national park is just near the city of Seoul and it is easy to get there by public transport. There are many hiking routes to take, most people start from the east but I start from the west and come down by the east. I trusted maps.me and found this weird path that start from like a small village. The route require you to hike up one of the peak (forget the name), then proceed to follow the path downhill and hike up Baegundae Peak which is the highest peak with the Korean flag on it. The path I took was harder but shorter as compare to the normal route people take from the entrance. I did stumble upon a few old forts and bunkers along the way. Take a look at the photos for the views itself."
Excellent getaway from the city!,"Extensive network of well-groomed trails, with English on maps and signs. Some steep sections can be hard to complete for unfit people, or when ice-up. Many users even on a winter weekday with marginal weather, so expect tons of people on a nice springtime weekend!"
Pretty tough hike but so worth it for the view!,"We climbed the highest peak in an afternoon in Autumn. Views were stunning and such gorgeous autumn colours but its a tough hike. Rocky and steep, and towards the top there are sections you have to pull yourself up the nearly flat rock using the ropes provided. Not for the 'fair weather walker' and you need to have a decent level of fitness. I went up in trainers (sneakers) because I didnt have anything else, but I would recommend hiking boots for sure, and some gloves to protect your hands from the metal cable/ropes."
Incredible views.,"If you are in to walking an hiking this is a great park yo go. Is a really pretty park you will enjoy the nature and the wonderful views that his park has to offer. The weekends is a good time to go a lot of locals are walking in this park. Koreans love walking, hiking and camping you will never feel alone is always people walking in this trails. Be sure in check the weather and how hard or easy is the trail that ypu are taking."
Good hike,"Hiking Bukhansan is not as easy as what was written here. I didn't know which track i took as i engaged a guide to bring me up. It was drizzling when we started and got abit heavier along the way. By the time i reached the peck, it was foggy and i couldn't see much. Only after the climb then i realized that July was their raining season. However, i still enjoyed the hike even though i didn't get to see the view at the peak. Overall, it was an enjoyable hike and i will definitely do it again."
Asian Holiday,Amazing in autumn!! The foliage is beautiful and the air crisp and clean! Worth the little trek. And so accessible by train.
Hiking in Bukhansan is a must-do!,"If you’re looking to get away from the hustle and bustle of Seoul and you enjoy hiking in the outdoors, I highly recommend climbing one of the peaks in beautiful Bukhansan National Park. I climbed the tallest peak, Baegundae Peak, and it took me 2.5 hours to get to the top (I am a 52 year old woman, in relatively good shape). The climb is moderately challenging, and there are sections with chains and railing to help you along. In winter, you should attach chains or spikes to your shoes to climb on snow and ice. I went in both November and late December, and I enjoyed both the beautiful foliage of fall and the lovely snow in winter.For those like me with no car, Bukhansan National Park is easy to get to using the metro and bus. Take the metro to the Gupabal stop. From there, take bus #34, 704, or 8772 (you will see other hikers fully decked out in hiking attire). The bus will take you to the stop that leads to the main entrance of the park. It was pretty obvious to me which stop it was, especially when all of the other hikers got off at the same stop. From the bus stop you will need to walk for 5 minutes or so to get to the park entrance. Along the way, you will pass shops that sell hiking gear, clothing, walking sticks, snacks, etc.Bukhansan has many different trails to choose from, of varying degrees of difficulty and length. There are also different peaks to choose from. I chose the highest and loved it! The views are spectacular, and you can also visit a temple along the way. The trails are marked pretty well, and there are always other hikers around since it is a very popular pastime for Koreans. In fact, try to do the hike during the week, if you can. It gets super crowded on the weekends. Bring water and a snack, and enjoy!"
Scenic National Park Right in the Center of Seoul,"For a quick hike up a mountain right within Seoul, Bukhansan would be your option. Weekends tend to get a little packed as the locals also hike the trails to the peak, though the crowds are still manageable as there are many trails. "
Wonderful views and beautiful scenery.,"Whether its a visit for a full day trip or just a few hours, this place is great for unwinding and seeing beautiful nature and scenery."
Nice half-day trip away from the city,We hired a private tour guide to be able to drive us to Mt Bukhan and Bukhansan National park- this was really one of the highlights of our trip—we walked a shorter trail up to Harujae ridge that just took ~1.5 hours round trip—nice stone steps looked natural but made it easy to climb- great views. Teenage girls enjoyed it as just a short enough hike. Pretty steep so coming down would be difficult for people with knee problems. Very nice morning outing for the drive and hike and able to get back to Seoul city center in the early afternoon.
Unbelievably convenient and gorgeous,"Trekking is super popular in Korea, really the national pass time. As such, there are trails for all levels of ability in this national park. Views are stunning. So many temples to visit and paths to get you all over the park. Unfortunately, the hardest part is finding information in English. Blogs help. Public transportation takes you almost anywhere around the perimeter of the park. Well worth the effort!"
Highlight of my trip,"This was my very first solo hike up a mountain..took the Bugandae trail up to the peak...The hike up was challenging enough especially towards the top where i had to use steel cables to haul myself up...the trail was very scenic during autumn and i was amused to see local hikers much older than I zipping past me with ease while I was trudging slowly trying to catch my breath! The view at the top was breathtaking and there's a flat rock where everyone would sit to have their lunch and njoy the view of Seoul city. Took almost 3 hours to reach the peak from the main entrance with some photo stops along the way and another 3 hours down the same way. On the way down, i slipped a few times as I wasn't wearing proper hiking boots and the rocks were slippery. So anyone who wants to do this, please wear hiking boots for safety. Overall, this was a great experience and the highlight of my trip in Seoul! "
Not for the faint of heart,"Bukhansan is located in the northern part of Seoul and has an elevation of 2744 ft. If you are into hiking, there are several courses that you can take. On each course is a support center that has information about the park. It is not for beginners as it can be challenging as you climb the peak. I climb this mountain every year and each time I always thought it’s a never ending hike! On the trail you’ll meet all kinds of people: experts, “strugglers,” tourists, and expats living in Seoul. Koreans are very friendly so don’t be surprise if you get an invite to join them for a picnic on top of a boulder. At the peak is the most glorious view of Seoul!"
Just try any trail,"As it has several trails, why don't you try one of these?This is not that big or spectacular, it has quaint lovely trails ypu would love.."
There are no words to describe it in winter!!!!,Amazing Place. I only visit in winter with a lot of snow and love it. The possibility of being so near of the city center and have a place like this is incredible. It's nice to go all day. In weekends it's full of locals all dress up to go to the mountain. If you want to go to the top be aware that if you don't have good boots with good grips it can be danger (in winter).
Nice Park directly by the city,The National Park is a very good place to experience nature in the massive city.It's important to know that Koreans are hiking very often. That means you should definitely choose one of the easier tracks if you aren't hiking often (like every weekend).The view of the city is awesome. You can see the mountains on the other side of the city if the smog isn't too bad.
AMAZING,"So beautiful and amazing. We visited in July and went to one of the top-outlook while it was still dark to watch the sun rise, and it was just incredible. So amazing like you were suddenly standing in another world. Really worth a visit"
Challenging,I wanted to climb Baegundae peak while visiting Seoul. Getting there was a bit confusing but basically just follow people in hiking gear. I am not a very athletic person so when I say this climb was difficult it was difficult. It took me a total of 5 hours to climb up and down including breaks. It was so rewarding to climb though because of the view from the top. I visited in autumn so the park was beautiful and the weather was nice and cool. Make sure you pack a lot of water and snacks. It’s a whole day event. 
I did not make it on top,But the mountain was gorgeous! I will return to this place using the other side for goin up/down the Peak. It was a wonderful autumn.
Challenge ACCEPTED!,"I would say this hike starts of pretty comfortable but perpare yourself because it may take you at least 2 hours to get up. As you hike higher up this mountain it becomes a bit more strenuous. At a certain point right below the summit you have to climb up the ""never-ending"" steep stairs, then use a rope that is provided to help pull yourself up. There were many people on this hike it was well trafficked. The view is breath taking.BRING lots of water and snacks to eat along the way. "
Better than Hallasan,"The view at the top is much better than the view at Hallasan on Jeju Island. Hallasan is a little more difficult, maybe, but this mountain is actually beautiful. The scenery starts to look amazing after climbing maybe 2/3 of the way to the top. Favorite hike so far"
Morning hike,"Excellent area for hiking as long as you start early otherwise it gets very crowded. After reading some reviews, we opted to follow someone and actually made a friend with a very kind hiker who stayed with us till the peaks. Many thanks to him, this made the experience even more memorable. We were on our own for the way back and struggled a bit to find our way as the directions are not so well indicated and there are many many trails. We managed to get back to our starting point eventually. Very good viewpoints, definitely not an easy hike. Hiking shoes recommended, some climbing.Good exercise for a Sunday morning.We came from Intercontinental coex, took the subway (9 then 3), about 1.5h to get there, less than $2 per person! Go by yourself, you don’t need a guide or bus or car. Traffic in Seoul is bad, the subway is for sure faster!"
Lovely views!!,"I went hiking by myself and was a little worried whether I could find the way to the top or not but it's well signed and I had no trouble getting up there. It's a lovely hike, I was there when all the autumn colours came out and the views from the top are spectacular! Really beautiful and so nice to be out of the city and surrounded by nature and breath in fresh air. Take some food and drinks with you and you'll have the best day! "
Solo female hiker in autumn,"Read the reviews and made this a must visit during my recent trip to Seoul. Did a weekday hike to avoid crowds. Set off from air bnb place in Bulgwang and proceeded to take metro to Gupabal station and then take exit 3. There is a bus stand just behind the street level entrance to the station where you take bus #704. There are also other buses which go to Bukhanseong Fortress entrance. Ask Driver to inform you when to get off as it is about 15 mins bus trip. The Park entrance is across the street. Along the way there are lots of factory outlet type shops selling branded hiking/winter gear which is quite handy. Usually there are groups of hikers going up. Would be best to trail behind them but there are sign posts too. However when coming down there are many forks in the road which you may get lost unless you follow a group. The locals seem to come from different areas, Tourists from another. Please do make sure you wear proper hiking boots and not trainers as the rocks are rather steep and slippery especially for the last part of the hike. It took me just over 2 hours to reach peak with some picture taking and water breaks. Stayed at peak and ate lunch and took more pictures! Take your time and enjoy the hike. Autumn is a nice time to go as weather is cool. Bring some extra food for the lovely cats up there!"
Great hike,"Great hike up the Bukhan mountain - definitely challenging enough, but not too hard and anyone without serious health issues should be able to do go up in a few hours. The final 300m ascent is something else, but the view and satisfaction is worth it!"
Great hike,"Yes, this is definitely a hike, but we saw people of all ages there hiking to the top so there is no reason not to. The views from the top make it worth it"
Excellent hike,"We hiked up to Baegundae peak. Wow, what an experience! We finished a round trip in a little less than 3 hours. We did not stop for breaks at all on the trip. We began at the Bukhansanseong Fortress entrance. We had locals trying to stop us because they thought we would get caught in the dark but they had no clue how fast we were going up. Getting to the peak takes quite a bit of physical ability. At one point you’re pretty much pulling yourself up by a rope. It’s awesome if you’re up for the challenge. The view from the peak is second to none. This is a must stop when visiting Seoul. "
Amazing trek up the mounts,My trekEntry : west and exit at east Duration : 4.5hours but general info is 6hoursBest time to go : fall. Nice colorful maple trees along the and wayTime to peak : 2 hoursFitness level : min to moderate 
Beautiful time ,"We took subway all the way to Donbongsan Station. Then just followed local hikers. All locals are nicely equipped for hiking, you can also buy everything u need in the market between subway and park entrance. We got little freshmade sushi roll for 2000 won, was a nice snack during the hike.At the entrance we talked to a ranger, and sent us to the highest peak of this side of the park: Jaunbong Peak. Going up and down took 4 hours with taking pictures of local cats haha the only animals we saw. We went during national holidays, wasn't very crowded, but we did meet quite a few ppl. After hike you can have lunch at one of the places back at the entrance. Certainly recommend."
Nice trekking place,"It's not to far from Seoul, beautiful park with nice rock mountain where we can trek and enjoy the beautiful views around, take nice photo of the natures, mountains, forest.."
Great place for a hike,"This is a national park very easy to get to from Seoul. Lots of hiking trails. Locals all fully kitted out, tourists usually not. Good views of the city. Some very challenging hikes to the summits, but easier ones too. We went to Guknyeongsa temple with the huge Golden seated Buddha. A much shorter walk, well sign posted but with some slippery paths, so good shoes useful Go to the main park entrance, Bus 34, 704 or 8772 from Gupabal station on line 3, or just follow the crowd of hikers and get off when they do. A nice break from the city, and pretty views."
Not precisely a walk in the oark,"Rain was expected, but skies were blue when we took the bus (704) from Gupabal Metro station (line 3) to the Bukhansanseong entrance. The start was both nice - a lovely creek running next to the trail - and easy, but it soon became steeper and steeper. Actually, it was more like a staircase than a trail in many parts. The last stretch to the peak (Baekundae) was both crowded and steep and the wire ""handrails"" were necessary for both ascent and descent.At the top, skies were grey, but the 360 view with equal parts of rugged wilderness and metropolitan Seoul was even more breathtaking than the trail.We had some few drops of rain on the way down - heading for the eastern exit in Ui-dong - but as the trail is made almost entirely of stone and rock, there was no risk for muddy conditions, though there might be some slippery slopes in case of heavier rainfall. We had only jogging shoes, but it is probably better and safer to wear shoes with harder soles.At the eastern side the autemn colours were stronger, especially the maples (Acer palmatum?) but in total less than one would expect in early October.The signs on the trails were partly in English and the risk of getting lost was minimal as there was a constant stream of hikers. Suprisingly, all trails were neatly included in the of-line map in the app ""maps.me"". Highly recommended.Our trip took us around five hours, including quite a number of stops, and was the highlight of our stay in Seoul!"
Fun hike,We enjoyed hiking up here followed by an afternoon in a Korean spa. We would rate the hike as moderate difficulty. We went with a guide for ease but it could be done without one too.
Autumn Solo Hike at Bukhansan,I hiked around 2nd wk of November. I took the train to Gupabal ( Line 3) went to Exit 1 then took bus #704. If you hike on a weekend expect a lot of people.I went to Baegundae trail. There were signs in English but I noticed that after about 1km I couldn't figure out where exactly I was. Bring food so you can eat at the summit. You will find a spot no matter how crowded it gets. I started around 10am and was able to get back by 4pm. You should do this when you go to Korea. Regardless if you are a hardcore hiker or not. It's an awesome experience!
great view in this city,"it's not too high, but it's really good view! it takes just 5 hours to get a top. specially sunset fi very nice!"
Great hike - tougher than I expected,Loved this hike but be ready. I'm 47 and this hike was tougher than I expected. We picked up Kimbap at the food stand right off the subway (line 3) and had a picnic on the mountain. Really enjoyed this hike but I was sore the next day. 
Wonderful Park Within the City,"Bukhansan is a beautiful mountain, the tallest in Seoul, and a gorgeous, clean park. It is dotted with many cultural and historic sites. We saw numerous birds and small animals, which was also fun. Definitely recommended. "
Took the challenging Baegundae trail!,"There are several trails to the Baegundae trail starting off by the Gupabal entrance, this was my second big hike of the year and boy was it tough still! Especially when you get the the rock itself, it gets really steep and triring especially in the heat. However, once you've reached over the tree's and take a look behind you...the views are breathtaking, its definitely a WOW moment seeing the view for the first time. Despite the difficulty it was definitely worth the energy. Definitely go as early as you can with available sunlight, as we started the hike around 8, and it was very empty, however getting down around 12 it was starting to build up. I could imagine the rock being very hard to climb up and down when there are crowds of people."
So good for hiking! Reward is priceless,"This is a hiking park. It is recommended you wear the right outfit and bring lots of liquids. It is not for beginners, you can make it as long as you have worked out in the past because the paths to go up hill are tough. Once you reach the top, you will have the best reward which is a great view of Seoul and other mountains."
An excellent hiking park,Tallest mountain in Seoul. Popular mountain hike place. Be prepare to spend at least half day to go the peak. Outstanding view of City of Seoul. Many international travalers in th peak. Better to go a weekday and week ends are crowded with locals.
Best 12 hour layover ever,A 12 hour stop at Seoul's Incheon International airport left me eager to get out and move around a bit. I decided to head for Bukhansan National Park to climb the highest peak 'Baegundae' via the vertical ridge route. I left my bags in a locker that cost about $9 and took a taxi (the only transit available at 4am). The park had signs in english at all of the trail intersections so it wasn't difficult to find my way. What started as a rocky trail climbing to better and better views quickly escalated into some pretty committed bouldering on Joshua tree-like rock overlooking the city. I followed some different trails out of the park and ran all the way to a train station where I got directions to the airport line in broken english. After returning to the airport I used the free transit shower and took a nap in the transit nap area. What a brilliant way to spend the day in a new place 
Best place to hike in Seoul,"There are many trail, the highest peak is Baegundae Peak (approx 2700feet). It took bout 2hrs to reach the peak, not an easy hike, but after reach the peak you'll get mesmerised by the view of seoul."
Highly recommended!,"Not the easiest hike, but definitely worth it! Baegundae peak has an amazing view, and we enjoyed a mini picnic before descending. So do bring some food with you, you will need the energy. Spot the mountain kitty! There are many many trails, so do enjoy taking different routes for the scenery & nature."
"Amazing views, worth the hike","This hike was not easy but it was definitely worth it. We went on a weekday and it wasn't too busy but there were still many people. We took the bus 704 from Gupabal station to the entrance and the hike to the top took about 2 hrs (with breaks). We saw a cat and a kitten at the peak and a dog on the way. The peak is beautiful and there are tons of areas to sit and rest/enjoy the view. If we go back, we'll definitely pack a lunch and have lunch at the top! We took a different way down (opposite of the way we came up) and that wasn't as nice as the way up. Definitely worth the day trip if you have time :)"
Best hike near Seoul,This is my favorite place to unwind and decompress. I love Bukhansan!We have gone here with our family several times and the views are incredible and the trails are well maintained and easy to follow. 
My First Summit,"My fist is the only highest thing on this place.All your tiring journey will be paid off by its beautiful scenery along the way, fresh air, awesome view at the top and satisfying feeling when you get the top."
Challenging but worth it ,We took the train to Dobongsan station and walked 10-15mins to the park entrance. The ranger counter was just opened when we arrived at 8.20am. There are maps available. The level of difficulty is shown by the route (different from what is on their website). There were many solo hikers and elderly climbing too. We found some parts (especially towards the peak) quite challenging but still manageable as there are rails to hold on too. Took 4.5 hours to and fro. We went in August and weather was hot. Good hiking shoes and plenty of water! 
You must visit this during your trip,Beautiful park and very large area mountain walks and restaurants . Good parking avail el and well managed . 
mountain high,"I lived in one of the neighbourhoods below the park, it was a park I frequented for both short and long hikes. It has so many to choose from and all of them are well used and peaceful with something wonderful to enjoy no matter which way you choose. All paths are well marked."
Hiking in SEL!,"I took the metro and got off at Dobongsan Station which is roughly 45 minutes by train from city centre. You get off the train and only have to follow all the Korean hikers . The park entrance is maybe 15 mins by foot and you pass many equipment stores that provide EVERYTHING for hining (you understand once you are there) and a lot of convenience stores and street stores so you can purchase you water and food supplies.At the park entrance the rangers will explain the different routes in this huge park. I chose the Jaunbong which is the Dongbonsan Peak. Total distance going up only 3.3 km. Follow the signs towards Madangbawi which is the big rock. This 2.5 km will take you about one hour. Rest at the rock and start the hile to the three peaks and expect another hour.On a beautiful day you habe fantastic views on SEL!I decided to go back the same way to the rock and then towards Seongdowon temple because lateron towards the ranger station you will find the small river to cool your feet.My recommendations: i hiked on a Monday and had some fellow hikers, not sure if it was due to a weekday or the hot temperatures- take enough water supplies as you can only resupply at the gates. Total hiking incl brakes was 4 hours. Hiking gear especially boots are highly recommended. Njoy!"
Nice break from the busy city,We went there on a sunny day and had a great time exploring the national park. Some of the hikes were quite difficult - especially the peak of Bukhansan. Be aware that there are many entrances to the park. So plan ahead where you wanna go. 
Don't underestimate it! It could be overwhelming but definitely worth it!,"I hiked it through the easiest and shortest course, (Dosunsa course)I got off from Su-yu station, and grab a taxi to Dosunsa. It took me about 2.5 hours, the last half hour was quite challenging (do not wear Vans shoes when you go up this mountain lol) At the peak, I mean it was really worth it. The weather was perfect and amazing. But I recommend you to wear proper shoes and make sure to bring your water and towel. "
Hike to one of the peaks,If you want to hike to the peaks take the subway line 3 and exit Gupabal. Take then line 704 to Bukhansan National Park information center or just follow the hikers. If you want to return to the subway station take bus number 8772. Bring some snacks and enough water or drinks with you. The sight is very beautiful at the peaks and you can also visit some temple's. 
Perfect for everyone to walk,There were so many different ways to choose from with various lenghts of routes. We didnt have so much time or the right equipment so we took one of the shortest routes. If I ever come back to Korea I would like to go for a longer tour. Really Beautiful nature.
Tiring but fufilling hike,"We started our hike at the Jeongneung Information Center. From itaewon, we took the Seoul Metro and get off at Gireum Metro station. From exit 3, I took bus 110B. After that we hike to daeseongmun gate and then to the peak, Baegundae. I had the taste of taking the toughest route towards daeseongmun gate. It was a great hike and along the way, you can spot the locals. At the daeseongmun gate, we had lunch and I was amused to notice the locals having kimbab. We managed to reach the top after 5 hours. It was a good hike! We ended off near Suyu station where there was some machine to blow dry my clothes and bag. What a hike!"
Great day hikes!,"How to get there: Take the subway to Gupabal Station. Love the station at exit 1. Get on the 704 bus and get off at Bukhansan bus stop.There are numerous great hikes in the park. And some of the hikes are for advanced people, because it is more like climbing rocks. We went to Yonghyeobong and Uisanbong and these trails are quite hard. Many people set off to Beagundae, but I could recommend doing this when the weather is clear so you can look far away. The mountains that I mention above are very nice and I would certainly recommend them if you want a nice adventure. Enjoy!"
Very tiring hike,The views are wonderful however the hike can be very steep at times. I would say prepare ahead of time.
peak experience,"I think it's fair to say the hike to Baegundae Peak is pretty tough for the casual or non-hiker, but is definitely worth it. Not just for the views from the summit, but for all the gorgeous scenery along the way.The trails are well signposted and the very steepest sections have cables/steps to help you along.There's lots of trails to choose from and more than one way to Baegundae Peak itself, so I would recommend coming down a different trail to whichever one you take up in order to see more of this lovely park.A quick google search will give you easy instructions on how to get to the park from Seoul."
A Diamond in the Rough.,A beautiful National Park. A bit of a challenge to get there as a Tourist as many locals have never set foot in it even though it is only a few minutes from Seoul. The Park is beautiful and quite wild. The baths are demanding but fun. There are a lot of Boulders to climb over and the paths are quite steep. 
Fabulous hike away from hustle and bustle of the city,"The Bukhansan National Park was on our bucket list for the visit in Seoul, and we were very happy we got to do it. It was a hot morning in early June, and we brought about 4 litres of water and Gatorade for the hike. Not very crowded track, but be prepared for the steep hike and approximately 700 meters you have to go up. The scrambling at the top is not for the faint hearted, but feels very safe with steps chiseled into the granite, and ropes to hold on to. I was almost seven months pregnant at the time and managed to do the return trip in five hours. For some weird reason both our hotel and taxi drives seemed unaware of where we actually wanted to go for the hike, so we were almost dropped of at the complete wrong place. The taxi ride from Myeongdong to the park entrance was 40 000 won, while the return trip was 15 000. Go on a day with no rain, I would imagine the granite slabs at the top to be very scary and slippery in wet weather."
Amazing place for hiking!,"This is by far one of the best attractions in Seoul! Amazing views of the city, great nature (especially autumn), lots of routs for both experienced and beginning hikers. Highly recommended! "
Amazing!,This place is great for people who love the outdoors. The park is so big and there are so many different mountains you can climb if you're a hiker. I've been to a few different parts of the park and each part has been stunning. There are also some areas where you can just go for a picnic or an easy walk if hiking is not your thing. 
Such a lovely day!!!!!!!!!!!,"I climbed up the mountain with my family on this holiday. We had a craving for some fresh air. Also, the weather was very nice! "
Exhausting hike but worthwhile,"This hike is not an easy one! Prepare ahead with a route, water, and plenty of food! But the view at the peak is well worth it. The hike is absolutely gorgeous."
Difficult But Amazing Hike to Jubong Peak,"We were confused by all of the different trails and peaks and ways we saw to get to Bukhansan National Park so we ended up on the east side in Obong & Yeoseongbong' Dobong District of the park that leads up to Jubong Peak. This does not seem like the route most people take. There were still many people on the trail but it wasn't over-crowded. One reason we took this route was because we could take the subway all of the way without having to deal with any buses. We took Line 1 and got off at Dobongsan subway station. It was easy to figure out which way to walk to the entrance of the park because we just followed all of the other people that looked like they were dressed for a hike! It was about a 1.5km walk to the park from the station and we picked up some gimbop and water on the way - there were many food vendors. The hike to Jubong Peak was 2.9km but it was not easy! The first half was uphill but the last .9km was incredibly steep. We had our 8, 10 and 12 year old kids with us and they made it too. I think it was harder on us than them. The last bit to the actual peak was almost vertical and you had to hold on to the railings to climb up. Thankfully there were railings at the top or I would not have let my children up there. It was incredible and the view was absolutely worth the difficult hike! We arrived around 12:30pm at the park and made it up by 3pm which included a stop for lunch."
Breathtaking View,"If you love hiking or trekking, Bukhansan is one of the best. It was Spring when I tried trekking. Go early in the morning like 7:00 to enjoy going up. I do not have complete gear but I made it. Well, I am not telling you to do it also (because we can hike without nice pair of shoes for trekking or hiking in the Philippines). I saw many oldies who enjoyed going up. What I enjoyed was seeing those flowers blooming around. They were beautiful. I definitely do it again when I go back to Seoul."
A Wonderful Day of Hiking,"Highly recommend taking a day and hiking in this park. There are many trails and I don't think it will be hard if you do not have a local, to get around. It is hilly, but doable, even if you are not in shape."
Rewarding hike!,This is something you should wake up early morning and head up the mountain. There are different routes depending on how challenging you wish your hike to be. Just make sure you bring plenty of water and a nice snack such as Kimbap to refuel you when you get to the top! 
Great place for a hike!!,Brilliant national park with some advanced hiking to the top and across the plateau. Definitely a must if in Seoul.
Must See and Do,We took the private tour and the employees were amazing. The hike is not for the faint of heart but it was well worth climbing. The views are great. The sauna experience will shock you as to how detailed and exotic it is but you will love it. The lunch was absolutely delicious and filling. Our tour guide moon made it so much fun for us. Strongly recommend.
Amazing views at the highest peak,"We took the most common trail to the highest peak (Baegundae). We went on a Monday and got to the park around 0730. At this time, there was barely anyone on the trail. So when we got to the top, there was only ever 3 other people at the top. We spent about 30 minutes at the top and on the way back (around 1130) we started seeing a lot more foot traffic. So come early and try to avoid the weekend/holidays. Do not underestimate the trail, it is only 4.2km but it is very steep. Very challenging, and the view on a clear day is definitely worth it!"
Must do it,"Be ready to experience real hiking workload, but at the end you will agree that it's absolutely worth it. View from the top mountain is breathtaking. Sea, city and park panorama is amazing. Seoul is great city itself, but this sight must be included into your trip. So wear convinient for climbing outwear, get more water in your back pack and just do it! You will never regret."
Family Adventure to Baegundae Peak!,Best part of our Seoul vacation was family hike of Bukhansan National Park to reach Baegundae Peak. The views from the top are breathtaking and not to be missed. You need to have the proper hiking gear to go up as the trail is long and challenging. Took our family almost 4 hours to reach the peak.
Solo hike,The view up there is nice and refreshing. its not the hardest place to get to but you still need to do a bit of research. i went there really early in the morning so there was hardly anyone and at times i am quite worried that i will get lost but all in all. its a must do if you like nature and hiking :)
Amazing hike,"We started the hike early in the morning and had the Baegundae peak to ourselves! Starting from the east side, it is quite challenging (there is an easier route from the west side of the park). It's a short drive from the city - 15 min by taxi. Highly recommended time away from the busy city. "
Thrilling and scared,"If you stayed in Itaewon then you could take a bus number 110B and wait till the very last stop. Straight to Bukhansan National Park main entrance. For me, it was good hiking for someone that is not really have a good fitness. Many trails to choose, from easy to extreme but at some point will meet at the same checkpoint. You can enjoy the view of Seoul city during this journey. And its look easy and yet so challenging especially when you about to reach the summit. Its kind of mix feeling for me to be on the summit but I guest it was good to challenge myself here to encounter my fear of height. And the view on the summit, especially during the sunny day is quite worthy with the trail I encountered. "
Awesome,Wonderful mountains!!! Great for trekking or hikking. Would defenitky recommend to anyone interested in nature.
Very great place for hiking,"Been there during Spring time, cooler than i thought. I suggest you bring a jacket along when hiking and bring more water and fruits. And I really recommend you to bring your lunch and snack and have a nice rest on the top of the mountain and enjoy the nice view!!! It was really nice but strong recommend wear long trousers and bring a coat ahhaa"
Breathtaking view!,"I took about 2 hours to climb to the top, spent an hour at the peak and took 1 and a half hours to climb down. The hike is an intermediate level I would say. It would be best to have proper hiking shoes because some of the rocks might be slippery. I wore sneakers for the hike, making my climb a lot more tiring but it was still manageable! The hike is really tiring but the view at the top is well worth it! Very important to bring enough water for the hike, at least 1 litre in my opinion. I would recommending bring some food too so you can picnic at the top! Kimbap is a great choice!"
"What an amazing place, right out of the city.","If you love hiking, don't miss. Take a bus to get there and enjoy yourself. It's best if you get a map of the trails before you get there as all they have are maps in Korean. However, everyone is very friendly and eager to help you. You might not be able to communicate, though. As a foreigner, you will feel perfectly fine and safe there."
Amazing! ,"We did the hike all the way to the rock at the top - 2 1/2 hour climb. Hardest part is the first 2kms as it's very steep, after that you might as well continue all the way. Then after about 1/2 hour at the top it took us 1hr 45min down (via a different route). We followed the instructions (for option 2) to go all the way down to the township and then caught the bus to the metro station. We aren't hikers and we found this a manageable and enjoyable hike. Stunning views. So happy we took the time to visit. It was very busy for the short 300m part to the top, patience required. We took 5L water (in two camelback reservoirs) and ran out of water with one hour to go on the climb down. We also took plenty of food including snacks with us. I'll include a picture of the transportation instructions we followed that I found online - we used the first as our accomodation was in myeongdong. "
Wow! Most visited National park in the World,"You will love this trip. Only a 40 minute bus ride from central Seoul. Well maintained, there are paved walks if you want them. Lots of temples and incredible flowers. Very well maintained."
Hiking in seoul,"There are numerous entrance to Bukhansan national park and there are different trails. We didnt reach the peak, but we enjoy the hike. We met mainly locals during the day."
Highlight of our Korea tour,"Bukhansan is amazingly beautiful. We did a 3 hr. hike and there were cherry blossoms all around. Take a picnic and buy a korean flag beforehand like we did for great photos on top. To get there: Take subway to Gupadal station, exit 1. From there take bus #704, 34, or 8774 (you will see other hikers) towards Bukhansanseog Fortress (about 10 stops). We just got off with the other hikers, no problem. There are restaurants at the bottom too. "
Fantastic place to escape the bustle of Seoul,"This is a large mountain range, popular with hikers. There are short and long routes with many peaks, but most of it is accessible for casual hikers. Some routes take you along valleys with streams, some go along ridges. There are tree covered and bare parts and the rock looks stunning in morning and evening light.There are quite a lot of small local restaurants on the small roads leading to the main trails, and these are perfect for a post-hike feast of pajeon and makgeolli.The map website run by Naver (search for it) will show you most of the routes. If in doubt,l just follow the people in hiking clothes."
Great hiking experience!,"Superb view at the top! And though the path got relatively more challenging halfway through (the first half is nicely paved and even has stairs), it is well equipped with steel cables to provide support for people like me who are afraid of heights. The peak has quite a small area though so you have to snap your photos quick as people will just keep swarming up. Also, advisable to bring a windbreaker as it's very windy up there."
Beautiful,"A metro and bus journey to get there from Seoul but well worth it. Beautiful, natural park, lovely scenery and an excellent hike if you want to make it top the top of the peak(s)"
Worth every step,"We left from downtown Seoul -- took the purple Line 5 train to Jongno-3 station and got on the orange heading towards Daewha. Got off at Gupabal station (use exit 2) and got on the 704 (or 34) bus. We went on a Sunday, so there were plenty of other hikers to watch and follow. Got off ~10 stops later at something that sounded like Bukhansan and followed the hikers into a small town (lots of hiking gear and food/drink). BRING A LOT OF WATER. If you're going up to the top, you need minimal one bottle per person, but 2 would be better. You can buy this in the little town. There are also a couple of bathrooms on the way up, make sure you use them while you can!To be honest I have no idea the route we took, we just kept following signs toward the peak. Took us ~2.5 hours to get up there and another 1.5 to get back down. If you've read some other reviews, you'll have seen people recommend gloves - it's because of the lines you have to use at the top -- we made it without gloves, but they sure would've been nice, especially with sweaty hands! Absolutely worth the effort, even on a hazy day like we had. Not sure it'd be possible to get to the top on a rainy/wet day, so plan ahead!"
Absolutely beautiful ,A must-do in Seoul !! The hike was challenging at times(be ready to use all fours)but it was absolutely worth the time and energy!!
Golden Buddha - hidden gem,"Great place with easy access from Seoul center. Baegundae peak with impressive view of the city is quite challenging. Final part you must go next to the ropes. Best place in Bukhansan is Golden Buddha, not very popular trail, only 40-50 minutes from the entrance of the park. Very calm and beautiful place."
"Intermediate to advanced hike but fun to the top, even for kids (9, 12)","This was an unexpectedly difficult but fun hike. You should be in reasonable shape or you might not enjoy this. Don't trust the Korean national park website that claims this is a beginners hike with slight slopes. When we arrived, we saw the sign - intermediate/advanced and even expert at the top. We decided to just go for it anyway and try to hike up as far as we could. And eventually ended up on the top. Our kids were actually not the problem, they kept jumping ahead over the stairs and boulders, but we got a little tired instead - it is a lot of stairs going up through the forests but you are frequently rewarded with great peeks of the surrounding rocks and summits. The last (optional) part of the hike is pulling yourself up along huge steel wires leading to the summit, but every post is secured by 3 wires, so I personally found it very safe for kids. No danger of slipping off somewhere.We started around 12 when a lot of older local folks were already heading down and when we arrived at the top 3 hours later, it wasn't crowded. It was on a weekday though, a Wednesday which is probably the best time to go up, the weekends are supposed to be very crowded. It was a bit chilly up there. We ate our snacks with great views over Seoul and accompanied by 5 cats (who knows how they got up there).We headed down the other way on the back of the mountain which had fewer stairs and a shorter way down. There was also a small hut where you could buy snacks and refreshments. We heard from hikers there were buses leaving from exit of the park but we were picked up by a very friendly Korean CSI guy (haha) who also took us to the nearby Buddhist temple around the corner and drove us to the next metro station. I was a little suspicious at first but he turned out to just be a super nice family father.Take the Metro Line 3 to Daehwa and get off in Inchuk. Wait for bus 72 that takes off at the exit and tell the driver (Bukhansan). When you are dropped off, continue to walk past a kiosk with barking dogs and then take a right. Walk up the street past the big signpost saying Bukhansan National Park. Keep walking up the road past all the hiking equipment stores on your left until you come to the little hut where the paths start off. Definitely grab a pair of gloves on the way if you plan to make it to the top, it will prevent you from getting sore palms. English maps are out of stock at the moment, but everything is signposted well enough that you neither require a guide nor a map. Oh, when you see the signpost to the left to Baegundae peak, don't cross the river but continue to walk up the river on the right river bank. The rest is well posted. You cannot get lost. Have fun! Bring lots of snacks and water."
Spectacular!!!,"Celebrated my birthday march 9, 2016 at the top of Bukhansan Mountain. Started trekking at 8:30 in the cold morning ( forgotten which base we entered). I was with a Priscilla , Malaysian- Canadian i met in the hostel. It was the best birthday ive ever had in my life. Saw lots of locals and foreigners in small and big groups. We reached the top of the mountain and you can see the whole city from the top. Took lots of pictures, stayed for a while , we went back after we were fully rested. A must place to visit for all, not good for children though"
Awesome!,My friends and I actually climb this moutain to the peak and when were halfway up there we realized that we've been climbing at advance level and to the peak its expert! No wonder we were tired but it wass all worth it as you felt a sense of accomplishment up there
Great place to hike,Very close to downtown of Seoul. Great place for hiking. Some trails are very difficult. You have to be equipped before go.
Worth the visit,"I initially found most the reviews pointing towards taking the subway to gupabal/gireum. With a stroke of (bad) luck, I woke up late on the day I planned to visit Bukhansan. Googled a little and found that the quickest way to reach the Baegundae peak was via taking the subway to Suyu station exit 3, crossing the road to the busstop in the middle of the road and taking bus 120. The bus 120 will stop at the bus terminal. Here it gets tricky, I got lucky and spotted the shuttle bus that takes temple visitors to Dosunsa Temple which is the base of the climbing trail. There isn't a sign or any counter that I could see that indicated that so maybe it would be helpful to ask anyone around. The kind bus uncle asked me ""Dosunsa""? and pointed me up the bus. Prepare 1000won but you don't have to give it to the bus uncle - when we reached the temple destination, there will be a donation box of sorts once you alight the bus, place it in there. From there, the entrance towards the trail sort of starts. I arrived at the temple/entrance at 2pm (I wouldn't recommend reaching there so late, I was really taking my chances, I thought I'd be the last one ascending but there were a couple more people behind me soon after. I didn't want to descend when the sun was setting so I had to maintain a rather regular pace) I reached the peak at around 3.30pm, it took me around 1.5hrs. There are signages along the way that are in English so that's helpful. There weren't many people taking the same path, perhaps this path's view isn't as nice. The view's good, it would have been better if it wasn't cloudy. I started the descent at around 4pm and reach the starting point at around 5pm. It was rather slippery going down so I'd definitely recommend actually hiking shoes, I foolishly brought my old running shoes in hopes that I could use and throw it after the hike, bad mistake. I had to use my hands a lot so a pair of gloves would be useful, the ropes are cold. The same shuttle bus would take you down to the bus terminal. There is a time schedule near the place where the shuttle bus stopped (I took the bus at 5.20pm, there was one at 4.50pm) So thereafter it's the same journey back to the subway station Suyu. I would have wanted to try a different trail down but it was getting late and I didn't want to risk descending in the dark with no clue how to get out. But it's a doable hike and I did enjoy myself, good for day trips for tourists who are interested to see nature.Done on 3 Apr 2017"
"Breathtaking view, and a good day's exercise in beautiful nature.","I took the 160 bus from Geondeok station and transferred to 162 at the Samseongyo Bridge Hamsung Uni. to end up at Jeongneung Daewoo Apt, which was a 15-20 min. walk from where I started the climb. The buses are good in terms of the fact that they convey in English the next stop -- pay attention and you will be fine. Transportation took about 1.5 hour.The total hike took about 5 hours in total to reach to the Peak and back (my Fitbit tells me that I have walked 21 km today, but believe the walk itself is about 10-14 km from start to finish). Don't give up -- it is totally worth it! Beautiful view, a nice cabin where you can enjoy hot ramen on the way down, and the possibility to reward yourself with sauna at Back Doo San sauna on the way down. The sauna is a bit run down, and not the most elegant sauna that I have attended in Korea/Japan, but it was extremely comfortable to feel hot simmering water for sore legs. Bring lots of water and hot clothes (I walked in March and it was still snow at some few spots). There are signs that can guide you, and helpful locals -- enjoy!"
Top of the mountain,"Wow, getting to the top was amazing, took the easier route up 1.9 km from the beagundae starting point, then took the 3.4 km down the other side. Went around 9 am on a weekday and there were only a few people at the top, coming down there were a lot more people. Hiked there two days, wish I could do more."
Beautiful View and great hikes,"There are so many great trails on this mountain. I have only done the main hike up to the top point. I have done the hike twice, it is medium difficulty throughout and takes up to 4 hours. As you get to the top it become more challenging and really tests your fear of heights or lack thereof. So many little stops to chill and talk with locals or eat some snacks and take pictures. It is a tradition for my friends and I to bring traditional Korean rice wine to share on the top a long with some food. There is a so many picturesque views that you can not pass up. "
Climbing the highest peak,"Without doubt a trip here is unmissable if you like hiking/climbing. We had a complete day here and it is soooooo beautiful. There are multiple sections to the park and you could come here time and time again to complete a different trail. We climbed the highest peak and the view made the climb worth all of the effort! Free entry to all and the car park is very cheap also. The photographic opportunities are plentiful and the weather was very kind to us. Lots of hiking shops around to stock up on items you may need also. Allow yourself plenty of time and definitely take water with you. We took our dogs the first time but then discovered that they are not allowed in the National Parks so we went back without them the following week. Lots of trails of different ease and difficulty with temples dotted about all over the place. Well signposted, immaculate and a must see."
Fantastic Hiking and Views,"I have been a Boy Scout leader in Seoul for the last nine years and have hiked Bukhansan dozens of time. This park is in fact my favorite hiking location and is one of the most hiked in Korea. The park is formed by two parallel mountain ridges with a steep valley between them. Hiking starts on paths at bottom of the mountains and go up to the ridges. Hikers then walk along the ridgeline enjoying the sights. Part of the old Seoul defensive wall runs along the ridgeline on the east side. Located north of the outskirts of Seoul, mass transit is available to several of the start point where outdoor stores and restaurants can be found. A day spent hiking the ridges of Bukhansan is a fine day indeed. "
Beautiful views!,I love this park! They have so many different paths to get to the top depending on your skill level. Totally worth taking a day to hike! 
Frozen waterfalls and amazing vistas,"Located in the near approximately twenty minutes from Uijeongbu, Bukhansan offers caustic views amongst the wildernesses; a far cry from the bustle of the city. You are greeted by a traditional temple which we were fortunate to visit on a day when monks walk the grounds willing to give a history of the location, a blessing for good health, and a cup of local tea and a pastry. Restrooms are plentiful and clean. Stop by the small restaurant for a bit to eat or a hot tea. Scrambling is necessary in many areas but if you're up for the challenge the scenery is worth it. Be sure to wear good hiking shoes. "
Bukhansan Trails!,"Lots of paths to take which could take you hours, days, and weeks. Make sure you have some good shoes or walking stick because there are lots of potential chances of slipping"
Good medium hike,I loved the idea of being able to hike a mountain in the middle of a metro city! a must do in Seoul.
Fabulous mountain views with many trails for various skill levels,I have hiked 3 different trails in this park area and each time have been inspired and amazed by the beautiful mountain views there. This is a great park to hike for people of any skill level.
Tough climb in the snow - but worth it,Climbed Mt Baegundae the tallest mountain in the park in the afternoon in the snow on the day i arrived in Seoul. The trails were good and well marked but the steep slopes on the last 1km were tough in snowstorm and icy conditions. Ice Cleats (spikes) are needed for the climb - which can be purchased at one of the many outdoor shops near the park entrance. The mountains looked beautiful in the snow.
Top of the World,"We hiked the summit of Mt. Baegundae: Very recommendable challenge! Cables and stairs help, ice and snow did not, but we made it :-)"
A lovely afternoon out.,I went there for an afternoon walk with my boyfriend on a Friday and there were barely any people around. It was incredibly peaceful and not that difficult a walk. We took the bus 143 from crown hotel near Itaewon to the end of the line travelling North. It drops you off very close to the National Park building with the information office in.
Great Hiking location with a multitude of trails,Hiked this area almost every weekend. There is a wide variety of trails so that you can keep coming up with new routes every time you visit. Great view of Seoul once you get to the peaks as well.
Just do not miss it,Great way to experience the outdoors when you visit Seoul. The views were great. You should not miss it
Perfect for a weekend getaway,"To climb to the top of the mt you might need about 2 hours, and it's definitely worth it. The view was spectacle there on the top, but you probably need a pare of climbing boot to avoid some potential injuries."
Beautiful!,After the bussle of the cities it is great to get refreshed by taking a hike in the National Park. Work a few hours.
Cool place to hike,"You can hike the whole day there if you want. The way to the top is quite difficult. Koreans are very rude on the trail and stupid, they block the way and don't go away. You can visit several temples and Peaks."
"Tough walk, what lots of locals do during the weekend","Be aware this is a tough walk, have some good mountain shoes (beter then sneakers), a walking stick can really help, and bring enough water. When we reached one of the tops, it was cloudy so the view on Seoul was not very good. The taxi's to go back were difficult. The trick is to have your hotel name and the adress in Korean on your smartphone. We even had to swithc from taxi to get back to the city centre."
Beautiful but confusing,"Its lovely here, its amazing that you are so close to 25 million people in Seoul. However getting your bearings here if you don't read Hangul is almost impossible. The basic hiking map provided is just some squiggles on an A4 sheet. If you go do your homework fist and print out ant directions you can find on the web (few and far between) otherwise you will still be there in 2018!"
Must do,"Great way to experience the outdoors when visiting Seoul. Dozens of well maintained trails with varying degrees of difficulty. Peaceful, with great views. On top of that, there are about 20 Buddhist temples throughout the mountain. Makes for a great day of hiking."
Beautiful,The trekking trails are well maintained. Views were great. Baegundae peak is quite challenging. Need strong arms and legs for the last bit to the peak.
Great view from the top,The view from the top of the mountain is always great. I used to climb to the top on the weekend. so fresh and nice view from the top reminds me of the old days.
Fantastic place to hike. Hikes are 1 hour to 5 hours..,This is a great experience if in Seoul..although it will also test your fitness. Its best hiked weekdays at 7am ~ 9am start and aim to return by lunchtime. 
Great Day Hike Location Near Seoul,A great place to experience a local hike in the outdoors and meet locals. Very accessible with a bus trip stopping in front of the national park. Just 45 minutes from the city centre. Trails are well marked and beautiful maintained.You will be rewarded with a fantastic view of the city if you make it to the peak.
Worth the hike,"If you are up to a hike then this is worth a visit. I am sure you can get a tour that will drive you up the mountain but feel the true beauty of the mountain can be lost, we managed to see some wildlife on the hike up. Make sure you dress appropriately, comfy shoes or hiking shoes are a must"
"Overall, thrilling exercise, with the city vista : the last 30 min to the top was challenging!","From Gangnam Station, the taxi ride was mere $25 with tip (45 min), to the entrance roundabout. The taxi driver forewarned us that there would be any public transport from the drop-off/entrance back down to the town. Indeed, there is no public transportation on the way down from the park entrance to the local bus terminal. Obviously, there wasn't enough parking space for all the park visitors either. There was no one leaving the park when we arrived. I thought we would call for the taxi later, but, later, it turned out that the dispatchers said no driver would come up to pick us up either, although it was only 5 min. ride to the entrance. No Public Buses, either. Later, another taxi drivers in Seoul told me that, over the weekends, only a few taxi drivers would hang at the entrance to pick up the hikers back to the subway or bus terminal for the quickest and shortest ride at the fixed higher fare (illegal) but, I thought that would be better than no connecting service. Now the physical and mental preparation_________________Plan ahead for the rough day if you hadn't exercised for a while, or feeble. And, try to make it to the Stone wall Gate North at the castle wall (Bukhan Sanseong), that is, IMO, how far the younger and shorter ones could get to, but none of these courses are suitable for little ones. Now, the really steep part is the next 20 min. just a bit further beyond the Cabin Rest Stop (with log seats), but it was manageable with log steps and metal steps. The last freaky part after the Stone wall gate, was beyond my limit. No one told me that Stone wall gate was just the middle stop, before the next challenging leg. It was windy, and, if you miss any control of your balance, there is no tree or flat ground to catch you anywhere. Frequently pulling your body weight dangling to the metal wire rope rails, you will feel you are soaring above the tree lines to see the distant vista to Modern Seoul fabrication. This is where others said you need a Sun Screen. It appeared that I was standing on one giant grey granite formation in the last leg to the top.  Again, if you are not able to pull your body weight and lift your legs up high up on your chest leaning on the ropes for quite a distance (vertically) in this last leg (Stone wall gate-Top), you should stop at the stone gate of the castle walls. Upon this far up, you will have already experienced quite good mental and physical challenging moments and it would be equally rewarding looking around at 360 degree from the mountain top.Again, don't ""exhaust"" yourself until you see the last leg begins at the cabin rest stop. And, the stone wall gate next.Even for this short trip, you will need a proper gears_________________The high-neck hiking boots and the anti-slip gloves are a must! Lots of Korean Climbers brought walking sticks and they were wearing mountain gears that are bright and flexible. Unlike those Fit Korean Climbers, one of us was a big guy with some disability. He gave up at the cabin rest stop, which meant we had to come back to the same route to descent, instead of several other options to exit the park on other trails. But, I am glad he stopped there as it was impossible for him to climb the last legs. There are lots of sings, in Korean, that warns the elderly and the cardiovascular unfit people not to climb, it wasn't just the “at your own risk” sign. No Wonder why we saw a remote police station along the trail earlier. Until I tried the last leg, I did not know I was the unfit case myself. I was out of breath just short of one last turn to the top of the world, I exhausted myself too soon thinking the stone wall gate was the stop. The shaky legs and the spinnning head tells me to stop, while my arms were pulling my whole body weight on the ice cold metal rope fo quite a while. And, these descending group climbers would not give any room for me to continue upward.At the top of the last step, I freaked out, and there was no one in sight. And, minutes later my buddy who was ahead of me returned and said I just missed the last turn. But, I did not have any energy left.And, I was thinking of a leisurely climbing like Mt Sorak. But, this last bit is not for the amateurs. I can now believe the annual casualty reports at the base info center. One climber said later that he could not get to the top for the past 20 years, until the park management laid the metal rope rails and metal steps.The afternoon Sun was warm and downcasting its golden rays onto the city. Who knew that one could experience the nature so close in the city? I thought it was a bless to the Seoulites. It is within Seoul, and short, yet quite challenging to anyone. The rocks are ridiculously beautiful and vista at the top was woeful. In comparison to Mt. Sorak National park last year, near Sokcho city (East of Seoul)where the trails were slow, fun and minimally challenging. this Baekun-dae trail, although I was told that it is only the beginner's level, I find it much harder than Mt. Sorak. Or, I am simply older and unfit. The descending was less tiring but it took us quite a while being careful not to hurt our joints or spines. 2 + hours. Altogether it was 5+ hours for us with lots of mini stops. No Public Transportation service to the town_______________________Now, back at the foot of the entrance, as the night falls, the temple shuttle bus driver refused to pick up the last group of the climber, unlike we were told. With no available Taxi, I even called for the taxi but no taxi would want to come up to pick us up. We had to walk down another 35 min. in the dark path, spotting the wild boars along the way, to the bus terminal. What I find ridiculously unsafe was, the asphalt road was all well-lit, but the walking path down, was separated and often above the road level, with uneven ground or steps. In the dark night, it was really dangerous. And, we noticed some abandoned dogs approached us probably for food. Then, almost half way down, we saw the same bus passing by us with the climbers on the bus. Why didn't he take us in the first place? I have no idea.We grabbed a random local bus heading to South of Seoul, Gangnam (well, I could read Korean to use Korean Transport app). Otherwise, the destination on the buses was clueless for a foreigner. Many other buses were heading further North East. After 20+ stops, we got off the bus at a busy commercial area where we could find a taxi.This limited access to the transportation after exiting the park made us feel vulnerable and quite annoyed. But, the whole half a day trip out here was really memorable. And, I can see its rank on TA is soaring, too. So, when you plan to come to Seoul, pack your hiking boots, gloves, and a bright windbreaker jacket.We really enjoyed the day.Duration : 5+ hours"
Must do,"A good place to hike. Hike in South Korea is a must to do experience. You can hike without food and the Koreans that you meet during the trail are more than happy to share with you their food and rice wine. Beautiful view. I was very lucky to meet a guy, that explain me a lot of things about of the mountain and showed me some rocks with particular shapes, that I couldn't notice if I was hiking by myself."
Great day out in Seoul,"Not too rough yet challenging enough for a day out in Seoul. A steep climb for last 1km route but well equip with stairs and rope. Took us almost 4 hours to and fro while the park assistant told us about 2 hours plus. We went on beginning of October, suppose to be nice chilling day but the sun was too kind to us. Make sure you have sun screen with you all the time. After all, we had really good time.We took subway till Gupabal station then transfer to bus (704 or 34) then walk about 5 mins to park entrance. Just follow the local or other tourist :) Bring some snacks along. There are many restaurant near park entrance, those with english menu mostly more pricey; the local stall offer good food but language may be problem."
"Great hiking experience with good view, but prepare for rough hike!","We went to Gupakal station, took bus 34 or 704 and walked straight to information center. We saw long queue for the bus so we just followed. Many Korean come here for hiking on the weekend. It started off easy with proper road, on gravel road, & with easy rocky paths, challenging rocky paths & the final stretch looking like Mission Impossible scene. The path we choose is only intermediate, but it is actually very advanced level for normal people like us. So please come prepared with good hiking shoes & gears. If you are not sure what to get, you can refer to the Koreans outfit & gears which you can get around the information center.It took us at least 3 hours on the way up for the 4.2km to Baekundae Peak. We had to turn back with only 300m to the peak as it looks too dangerous without the hiking gears. We had lots of respect for the grandpa & grandma who hike so swiftly & jumping from rocks to rocks! The way down is a lot shorter as we dont need to stop & catch our breath. Despite all the challenges, this place is worth a visit but please get ready your gears, bring drinking waters & at least a Snicker Bar as you will be famish when you are at the top, especially when you see the Korean Grandpa & Gramma come prepared with Hot Cup Noodles or drink & a tiny stool."
Good walking trails. east to get to.,"Being seniors, we were a little concerned about visiting Bukhansan - not sure if we could cope with the walking trails. I can tell you now that it is definitely worth visiting. After visiting the lovely Gyeogbokgung, we took the line 3 metro to Gupabal station. Outside the station, jump on to bus no.704 and that took us to a stop just outside the Bukhansan National Park. It's a short walk into the entrance of the park where there is a ranger station. Speak to the lady at the window and she will show you an appropriate walking trail on a map. As it was late in the afternoon, she showed us a trail that will take 2 hours (end to end). The trail is most suitable for us as most of the track is bitumen and therefore easier on our feet. It was a delightful walk to the big Buddha temple in the midst of autumn colour."
"worth your morning time, every time you stay!","Went hiking there in the morning and almost have the plave to ourselves. Koreans are late risers. Excellent hike up the Baegundae takes you 2 hrs to go up and the same to go down. And than take a great lunch afterwards, can not get better. All you need is good shoes since path is very rocky and some water and snacks and you can go. Path can get very crowded and the top is only a small place so if you start late prepare to stay in the hikers queue!"

The journey took about 45 mins and costs W30,000 by taxi metre. Some taxis refused to go, maybe because it is an outskirt drive. It is advisable to get the hotel concierge to write down the address of the information centre in Korean and the telephone number too, to show it to the taxi driver. Our taxi driver called the info centre to confirm the direction and venue. We were happy to have met a taxi driver who is kind and friendly. It was ultimately a wise decision as we avoided the crowded metro and bus rides, and the 35 mins walking up the mild slope to the information centre from the bus terminal. The climb wasn't an easy one I must say, but manageable with intermittent rest during the climb. Some climbs were steep and rocky, a few flight of long stairs too. It is definitely not recommended for children, especially at the final climb to the peak. You will need to hold on to iron railings and step on the steep rock in order to climb up to the summit.Proper covered track shoes or mountain shoes must be worn, otherwise your foot and toes will get cuts from rocks and stones. There is a rest station midway, where you can purchase drinks, ice cream or cup noodles. A few decent toilet stops are available too. The climb to the summit took us about 1.5 hours, and is certainly worth the effort. Along the way we see beautiful autumn leaves, forests, magnificient mountain views at the top and breathtaking scenaries. It is advisable to start the trail earlier, with lesser mountain climbers. The crowd picks up gradually. When the peak area is packed with people, it makes it harder to climb up and down the narrow and steep slope. Happy climbing. "
The best place around the Seoul area !,It was certainly the best place around Seoul during my trip. Its good to choose autumn months (not that hot like summer and cold like winter and beautifull colors on the trees). Hiking is kind of national sport in Korea so expect many people especially during weekends and sunny weather. In my opinion is not that easy to hike so better have proper shoes and clothes (although its possible to do it in jeans and trainers it will not be a pleasant journey). There are many paths that you can choose but it may be not that easy to get there with public transportation. Views are breathtaking. You have to see it!!!
One day trek to the top of Baegundae Peak,"Took the tube from Anguk to Gopabal then the bus (I have forgotten the bus number) arrived at the park very early on a Wednesday morning, about 7.00 am and it was still a bit dark and I appeared to be the only one there. Two other people soon turned up so I just followed them. It took me about 6 hours to do the round trip to the peak with a few stops for rest and also to take in the stunning views. The climb was beautiful through wooded areas with lots of birdlife (many woodpeckers) and squirrels. The foliage was autumnal with beautiful colours.I saw very few people on my way up and there were only about 5 or 6 at the summit. It is a hard climb but perfectly doable with reasonable fitness. I am a 60 year old female and I made it with no mishaps other than some wobbly legs on the way down.Well worth the minimal trouble of getting there and I would advise going as early as possible to avoid any crowds. I did meet more people as I came back down. A good day out and I am so glad I made the effort as the scenery was stunning, especially at the peak when the mist appeared making the mountains look much more foreboding than they actually were."
Baegundae Peak - one of my most favorite hikes EVER,"Wow, where do I start? How about you can get there by SUBWAY? If you go in the fall, you will see the most incredible display of fall colors this side of New England. People all over Asia fly to Korea in the fall to witness the colors turning at Nami Island, but this hike is much more hard-core and cool. It's supposedly only 2 hours to get to the top, but you'll want to budget more time for hiking it, especially in the fall, because you'll want to take a lot of pictures and also, that last 1-2 kilometers is GRUELING. I did okay, despite the fact that I only brought water and no food. Was kicking myself about that, because it would have been fantastic to eat a sandwich at various points along the way. There were some poor people I heard along the way seriously struggling, making groaning sounds with every single step. I'm not sure they even made it all the way. The last kilometer or so is cables, and I think anyone with a fear of heights probably shouldn't do this hike at all. There's a fair bit of scrambling. I definitely used my hands quite a bit. It's somewhat like the cable section of Half Dome in Yosemite, but maybe even more technical (although at least, compared to Half Dome, this hike is much shorter).The views at the top are spectacular. In one direction, all of Seoul is spread out before you. And in the other, mountains. The mountains here have a gorgeous shape. And there is a mix of granite and trees, so they are especially photogenic. Plus, there was a family of 3 cute kitties at the top! I cannot emphasize enough how fun this hike was. I did the hike on a beautiful autumn Thursday afternoon, starting from the national park entrance (bus 704 from Gupabal Station) at 12:30 and coming back by 5pm. I didn't use poles or gloves, but I think they would have been handy. Not a hike for those with bad knees! A lot of rocks. The cables weren't rusty at least, so gloves are not essential but I think they would have made going down a bit more comfortable. I am so glad I did this before leaving Seoul. I think this hike should be on any hiker's bucket list!"
 Birthday Hike,"We hiked on the most beautiful fall day. Weather was perfect with sun and a light breeze. We traveled on the subway then bus to the park, so worth it! We saw birds, squirrels, a couple friendly dogs and cats. The hike was a great workout with the amazing gift of beautiful views at the top. Best birthday gift!"
Tougher than I thought it would be,"We hiked it with our daughters aged 9 and almost 11. And the trails were a lot harder than we expected them to be. We all wore sneakers and that's a minimum. I asked at the information counter and was advised on the route to walk. We ended up walking 11k with almost 700 meters in elevation (Hike from Bukhansanseong Information Center to Daenammun Gate via Daeseongmun gate to Jeongeung Information Center.) Apparently easier and shorter routes are available but I didn't find them. We did it a nice and dry October day, I can imagine when it's hot, colder or wet the hikes to be quite tough and you would need better gear to cope with the circumstances.But it's an excellent day trip when visiting Seoul and definitely worthwhile the trip out.It's easy to get to the park. Several metro station feed into bus lines that will take you to the start of the trails (just follow the other hikers). Bus also announces and displays in english what the stops are called so it's fool proof."
WORTH the hike!,"It is relatively easy to reach the entrance by public transports. We took the easy trail, rocky mostly. Regretted i wore the thin-sole hiking shoes, as i was not aware of the rocky trail. but it is definitely awesome view at the summit! we brought coffee but no food and that's really bad! overall, check the weather for the best time and day to hike as we went during rainy season and based on weather forecast, we started hike at 10am instead of 7am and that is totally fine. entrance is free but u need to pay a small fee for the map."
Hike it for the view!,"I've hiked some nice tall mountains in Quebec, Canada. But nothing compares to the hike that I've experience in Bukhansan National park.The view at the top is definitely worth seeing, but don't take it lightly as this needs good hiking boots!The area is easily accessible by metro followed by a ride in the bus. The time that we went, there were a bunch of people dressed for hiking, and they took the same bus as us. We weren't 100% sure where we were supposed to get off, but when they got off the bus, we got off as well!Careful at the top, it's so high and a tad bit crowded that you might feel like you're going to fly off the summit.*No entrance fee*"
Great for walking,"We wandered around a short trail on the park which still took a few hours to complete and let us see some amazing views of the surrounding mountains. There are a few temples dotted around the park too, which are great to discover. There are plenty of maps located around the trails too. "
Amazing View of the City,"I was able to get to the entrance of the park using the subway station then taking a taxi to the entrance of the park. I went in 2015 and Google maps and Apple maps did not work in Korea. It will give you an idea of what train to take to your destination, but it will not show you where you are accurately. Despite this, they are still helpful and will point you in a the right direction. I would sched a full day for the trip. Despite the maps posted along the trail, we still got lost. We wanted to be able to go back the way we came, but ended up on the other side of the mountain. However, despite that, all the locals (who spoke a conversational amount of English) were so nice to us and helped us get on a taxi back to the train station. I felt like this was a moderate hike, but due to the distance, some may think it to be a bit more strenuous. A lot of the locals will bring trekking poles (although I do not think it's needed). I would dress in layers because the top of the mountain is fairly windy and cold, while the bottom can be warm. One thing I wish I did before going to the top, that a LOT of the locals did, was bring a cup of noodles and a hot thermostat of water to eat at the top. It looked so good and my stomach was jealous. I definitely think this hike is worth the work and was my favorite part of my trip to Seoul."
Tough Hike with an Excellent view,"This is not an easy hike! Lots of steps and boulders to climb steeply to. Its a great work out. Do not climb if it rains or have rained few hours before your hike. it can be slippery. But end of the day, when you reach to the top, and get motivated by the locals to move; its all worth it. Stunning view! You get to see lots of great scenery and views. Every hikers dream. 2.5 hours to get up and 1 hour to get down. Enjoy!"
An oasis in a crowded city,Great park with walking / hiking trails. Wonderful scenery. Great for dog walking. It is a bit uphill but wonderful views if you don`t mind the steep hike.
Stunning Views,Absolutely beautiful and well worth a trip. Very easy to get to via bus. A stunning natural landscape.
Great hiking with stunning views of Seoul,"Beautiful National Park on the outskirts of Seoul. Easy to get to, we took the metro line number 3 to Gupbal station, exit 1. Then took bus 704 to the entrance (just follow all the local hikers). We climbed up Baegundae peak one of the highest in the park. Started off easy but the route does get harder/steeper as you go on up. Think this peak is for advance hikers!Took us just over 3 hours to reach the top (we are novices) but we did stop for a picnic lunch half way up. Views at the top - stunning. You can buy a map for 1000 yen and the lady marks out the route and times for you.This national park is big. There are many different routes and entrances so do you research before you go and be prepared with fluids and food. At the Baegundae peak entrance there are many hiking shops and food stalls if you forget.In all had a lovely day in the fresh Korean air."
Fantastic Scenery,Went there by an accompanied coach tour. Amazing scenery with the mountain and the river specially when viewed from high up on the mountain that is accessible by cable car. Unfortunately did not spend enough time. There are lots of tracks for adventure. Should go there again and spend more time and may be stay a few days. The speciality at the restaurant is the stuffed quid which is very good. There is a huge statue of Buddha and a temple.
"A lovely national park, I'd a little steep","This is a great national park conveniently located in Seoul by subway and then a short bus ride away. The view from the top is great, if only they had a bit more to see at the Base of the national park. Still it's not seorksan or jirisan national park. But it's a great way to spend a day in Seoul in autumn. "
Beautiful,Went here a few days ago to explore. Was really beautiful. Plenty of restrooms spread around and tons of scenery. Make sure to wear something comfortable because you will want to see it all!
Steep trails and great views,"Hiked to Bukhansan peak with my wife and in-laws who are Korean natives so cannot be much help on directions. However, please be prepared for this hike and don't make all foreigners look bad.Koreans do not seem to use switchbacks, and Bukhansan peak is about 2700 ft elevation, so yes, all the trails up are steep. Expect lots of stone or boardwalk steps, some bouldering too, all very steep.I have hiked multiple trails in the Smoky Mountains and other places in east TN, USA, and though Korean mountains remind me a lot of this environment, the Korean trails I have hiked are without exception steeper overall than trails back home.Considering this, our party was hiking at about 1 mile per hour on the way up, perhaps slightly faster going down. Plan your water and food requirements accordingly based on the length of the trail you choose. Even the shortest trail is likely to be a 2+ hour climb up. Could easily be an all day hike, so most hikers you will see packing a lunch, snacks and plenty of liquids.Wear sturdy shoes if you have them, though the hike can be done in tennis shoes if you are careful with foot placement.Finally, enjoy the magnificent views from the top - there is a reason this is so popular!"
"Great, fun hike, could get crowded. Hiking boots recommended.","For a hiker visiting Seoul, I would say Bukhansan is a must. There must be few places where one can take the subway to a National Park and hike a nice trail.There are many hiking options. This review is for Dobongson Peak (aka Jaunbong), one of the most popular hikes. Take the subway to Dobongson (not Dobong, the stop just before). It's a pretty long ride from the city (40-50 minutes).You don't need a map or gps to get to the entrance from the subway. Cross the street, and follow the long line of hikers who know where they're going, or the shops that line the path from the subway to the NP entrance.Once there, pick up a map from the rangers. The ranger recommended the popular trail (highlighted in picture). The trail to Jaunbong is only about 5 miles (5.12 with several sidetracks), but it's a 1900+ feet ascent. There are several sidetrails to temples. I recommend a visit to Cheonchuksa, which requires a detour. Most other temples are right on the highlighted route. The junctions are not obvious at times, and they are not always marked in English. However, if you keep going up, you will likely find your way there eventually.Hiking boots / poles are helpful, but not essential. I went on sneakers because I didn't want to pick my boots / poles. Prepare for some slippage, esp on the way down. However, the trails are very well maintained (though it is possible to get slightly lost). Most of the trail is in the shade. There are many stop areas. You need to bring water and food for sure.The peak gets a little crowded, but the views are amazing. There's a little stream at the bottom where people like to hang out and have a picnic.Because of its easy access, the park must be a madhouse at times. It was mildly crowded when I went on a weekday morning. I read somewhere that it's the highest hiker / area NP in the world.There are many outdoor-gear stores on the way. The stuff is not cheaper than back in nyc. There are also many little restaurants that dot your path, and a couple of 7-11s for drinks, etc. There are several bathrooms at the base."
"""Great things are done when men and mountains meet"" Whiskey Bravo","Take the subway to hike a mountain = gotta love it!My revelation (and I reserve the right to be wrong) is that there is no Bukhansan Mountain. There is a fortress that you can hike along the perimeter that seems to be more than one mountain. There are definitely multiple mountains to climb in park. I hiked two to the west of the fortress. The fortress hike can be crowded, but it is worth the crowds and heat/cold. The two I hiked to the west of the fortress, I found simply by probing the perimeter of town. Those trails had excellent views too. Additionally, one mountain required climbing gear to summit (research for a local club) Its all free :)Consider a bandanna map of Bukhansan fm one of the several hiking stores around fortress access points/trail heads. Fortress trails are more fun and scenic than difficult (IOW fairly established and well maintained paths... some of the more vertical stretches may require some rest stops but overall the fortress are not demanding. As always w/ hiking = check the weather forecast and bring 'sufficient' water = make fun!"
The most beautiful views of Seoul!,"This national park covers a huge area, and the walks we tackled were quite difficult and involved literal rock climbing - not for the feint hearted! We entered via suyu station and then no.2 bus to Hwagyesa temple. From there it was a steep climb to the top, only about an hour, but many tracks we followed signs to the 'ridge walk' and then just followed any heading upwards. The most breathtaking views at the top! "
"If you like hiking, it is a must.","I love hiking and I had planned to do it. I was going to join a tour group and pay about $150 for the hike, lunch, and Korean spa after. However, by the time I knew I could go, there were no more spots on the tour. So, I went by myself with public transportation. There are excellent articles on the Internet on how to go to the trail head on public transportation. The hike was wonderful but challenging. I had jet lag and did not have enough sleep, so it was very hard for me. However, I see a lot of people do it, young and old, men and women, well equipped or causally equipped, all made it. You must have enough water and pace yourself. For most people, it is 2 hours up and 2 hours down. It is an extremely popular hike for the locals, so there will be people. It is unlikely that you will be lost if you just follow the trail. I did find a few cross-roads to be somewhat confusing at times and wished I had a guide at the moment. But I managed to make it to the top. You are rewarded with an unparalleled view of Seoul. "
Unforgettable hike!,"This is definitely the most exciting and challenging hike we have ever done so far. We went for the highest peak which is the baegundae peak. Perhaps we were too ambitious. We should have went for lower peaks rather than the highest.It started off easy but along the way it gets tougher and harder. We were actually on the right path until we reached this intersection where we did not know which way to go as there were no directions given. We saw a group of locals and we asked them for direction. However, according to them, we were taking a longer route to reach baegundae peak. They advised us to take a shorter route by asking us to follow them. We backtracked for about 45 min and finally reached the route which according to them supposed to be the shortest and fastest route to reach baegundae peak. However, they did not warn us that this route is for advanced climber and we are obviously not advanced climber.We followed the recommended route and soon the route gets really tough with steep rocks path where we have to literally climbed with our arms and pull ourselves up with the help of steel cables. My fiancee is definitely not up for this but she tried her best to do it. Even I find this route really tough. We feel like turning back halfway but we wanted to get to the peak. Each time we took a break along the way, we looked up and what we saw was just rock paths, nothing near to the peak. The climb seems forever. While taking breaks, we get to meet some locals and some offered us food and drinks. It's really nice of them. Finally, we reached the last checkpoint which says 300m to baegundae peak.The last 300m to the peak was the toughest and most dangerous route of the entire hike because the slope got really steep and slippery. Steel cables are available for support but it requires a lot of arm strength to pull ourselves up which my fiancee has difficulty of doing so. We endured till the last stretch of the route to the peak which was extremely steep which my fiancee is unable to continue. I can tell she was very scared and due to safety reason, we turned back down. Going down was not as simple as it sounds too as it seems like going down is even tougher than going up.Finally, we reached the baegundae info center and we were so relief that we made it down safely. At this point of time, we were extremely hungry and tired. We approached the info center staff and requested for her help to call for a taxi which came after 15 minutes. We went straight back to our hotel.Altogether, we hike for 7 hours, 4 hours up and 3 hours down. I read online that some people only took 4 or 5 hours up and down. We even missed our lunch. We only ate some snacks along the way. I regretted not bringing more food for this hike. We were slow but we completed the hike safely which is the most important thing.My advice is do not attempt to climb this mountain if you are a novice climber like us. This is definitely not for faint heart as well and please bring more food! Our last overseas hike was at Hong Kong's dragon's back which was so much easier than this. Dragon's back was like nothing compared to this. Please do more research and be more well prepared with mountain climbing gears if you really want to climb this mountain.Lastly, I gonna say the view from the top was simply breathtaking but it can be dangerous if one was to fall while climbing. Overall, it was an unforgettable experience which we will remember for the rest of our live. I am glad we made it up and down in one piece and I am really proud of my fiancee who has stepped out of her comfort zone for this hike. I know she was very scared at some points of the hike but she endured the entire hike without any complaint."
Amazing Park!,"We went down there on a Monday (all information desks were closed) so you just have to start walking. I think there are a lot of easier ways to get to the top (see pictures) but it was amazing. It took us about 2,5 hours to get to the top. only saw a few locals during the hike. Not one tourist we saw during the hike. ( we started from the main entrance, see picture) and just started to walk. if you are not able to climb rocks, get up and down by a rope don't go this way! but if you like some adventure....this trek is amazing!really loved it! and the views are amazing! No information in English during the hike, so you have to go by yourself (but follow the path and you will be fine)"
Superb views,"The Seoul City wall goes straight through this park. This is a military zone, so take your passport and get there in plenty of time. Some parts are steep. All the great views have a sign saying no photographs. What a shame. A great day walking."
Not for the faint of heart,"We went to Bukhansan mainly to hike. When I hiked it three years ago, I swore I would never do it again. It was a challenging hike. But then I went back the year after and again and again. The hike is challenging but enjoyable. I met so many people on the trail - professional hikers, students, locals, tourists and it's always so much fun to talk to them - about life, about hike, about Korea. The most rewarding part is reaching the summit. It's simply beautiful up there. I am not a professional hiker, not even amateur. But I have learned that I just need to take it slow, enjoy the people you meet, and enjoy the beautiful scenery."
Temples and tranquility,"This park is a hiker's paradise, and I believe that it would be ideal to hike in the spring/autumn months when the humidity is lower. There are many different trails with varying levels of difficulty and the park is accessible by local buses. Very often you will come across a temple during your hike - very peaceful and amazing to behold on a mountaintop. "
Stunning!,"We visited the Bukhansan National Park as part of a tour to get up to the Bukhansan monument. The views at the top are incredible. It's a robust hike but the view at the summit makes it well worth it. In short, well worth doing. It was one of of the main highlights of my trip!"
Beautiful!,"I took the subway to Dobongsan station. Exit left and followed the hikers to the park. I asked at the Information Center for hike suggestions and a map in English. Also filled up my water. Ample water stations and bathrooms. Very well organized park. I hiked to Madangbawi Rock. I loved it. Stopped at a couple of temples, and enjoyed the fantastic view at the rock. It was about 3 hours round trip taking my time and enjoying the experience. "
visit bukhansan. and do hiking! join us!(kakao; whygain86),"i usually go to bukhansan and other mountains near seoul with my friends.. there are so many different beautiful places and courses.. im not good at english but we have many experiences in hiking.. so if u wanna join us and share hiking experiece, that will be very greatful! if wanna contact us, plz give a message.(kakao talk; whygain86 --add friends)"
An excellent hiking experience.,Absolutely wonderful. We went hiking there on a Sunday with dozens of locals and it was a great cultural experience!
One of my favorite places in Korea,"Bukhansan is a beautiful hike and one of the hikes that first made me fall in love with hiking to begin with. If you live in Seoul or are just traveling and want to do a hike in the city, Bukhansan is definitely the best of the bunch, and it is one of my personal favorite things to do in Seoul.One great aspect of it is that there are multiple routes to the top, so you can do the hike in a few hours, or you can spend more time exploring the mountain's trails and peaks and make a whole day out of it. Whichever one you decide, you will not be disappointed. The contrast between the rocks and the trees make for astounding views of the mountain, and once you get to the top, the views are just as breathtaking.Signage to get to the top of the mountain is also plentiful. It's easy to navigate where to go, and if you get lost, you can always follow the horde of Koreans also making their trek to the peaks! Just make sure to stock up on water and snacks for the hike, and prepare for a great adventure. It's one that shouldn't be missed."
Most beautiful hiking site to see Seoul city!!!,It's very beautiful moutain near Seoul city dwontown.Bi-Bong(비봉) was best site to see the Seoul's sky line.It's not long route so that you can tour 1/2(6h) day tour.Starting point is I-buk-oh-do-chung(이북5도청). and You must ware the hiking boots.
Nearest hiking mountain from the center of Seoul City.,Easy access from all parts of Seoul City that takes an hour+ max. via Seoul Metro. Excellent place for Hiking & Climbing which is a suburban area of the Seoul City.
cannot belive that beautiful mountain is just behind the city,"what about hiking in metropolitan city, Seoul? there is really beutiful mountain just in Seoul! on the top of any peaks, you can find beautiful scenery of Seoul! This is the one of the memorable stops in Korea! Eventough it was so hot weather but it was ok sine there are many trees making shade for us! On the way to top, I found a temple, it was beautiful one,too like Jogyesa in town, can see real monk,too^^If I had more time, I could go for longest course. Recommend to visit! Tips : you can see variety of course, so choose one on your level, and there's a course you can see the fortress of Joseon Dynasty"
Magical views and Sneaky Temples,"Bukhansan is another true South Korean Gem. A national park that can give you so many different experiences from it's endless entrances. It is a mountaonous paradise but inbedded in a city once you have entered the depts of it's beauty, you see a different world of nature and Buddist solitude. There are hundreds of treks that go from dry river beds leading to waterfall to steep mountain climbs to the most breath taking views. The odd buddist Monk dwelling a temole will pop up to give you a real insight to the life of these people. Wilderness is something to behild in Korea because no matter how high you go, a bottle of rice wine or a pop up cafe are never too far away. I spent many a"
Amazing Hike!,"What I thought would be an OK hike turned out to be pretty awesome! I planned to do a trail that was approximately 5.6 km long, however when I reach the gate the ranger recommended a different route to take that would lead me to visit the mountain peaks and several temples. I was spontaneous enough to agree on the route he suggested so 7 hours and 13 km later I was exhausted but soooo satisfied at the same time! The natural beauty of the mountain blows your breath away. The temples within the mountain are majestic and are visited by Monks from all around. TIPS: things to take with you that I wish I had brought along: extra water, food, toilet paper, extra pair of clothes, towel as you can cool down in the river pools, for those who don't like mosquitoes take insect repellent. NOTE: only attempt the hike to the peak of the mountain if you are in good health as it is physically challenging at some points and you could over exhaust yourself if you don't take your time."
Good experience. Use VIP tour company,"Great. Would recommend 3h hike not more in hot summer weather. It's not an easy hike if you are not used to steep mountain with lots of rock. Chance was our guide. He was great. Korean sauna experience was ok, not great. Would probably skip if you have korean sauna in your hotel. Don't skip lunch with the guide. "
Nice Part but big,Difficult to rate because this park actually covers a very large area of northern Seoul. Nice walking paths. Families picnic on weekends. Used to be cleaner but seems Koreans are leaving more trash behind these days.
Great Hike!,We had a beautiful hike here one of the hottest day this summer. The view was breathtaking and the paths was great!
Beautiful views!,I would love to come here again! The views are spectacular and your fellow hikers will sure offer you some of their food!
Took Easy Trail,"It was a great experience to try hiking in Korea. My Korean friend could not accompany me during our visit, but since we are not well prepared, he recommend us to take a route from Dobongsan Station. As we went on the weekend, we met lots of hikers along the way, so it is easily for us to find the way up. It was crowded but also very calming area surrounded with family, elders, and even couples during our visit on mid May. The weather was good, and we decided to got the map from the information office and took easy trail. But i have to warn all of you, it was not that easy even in Spring. You have to well prepared especially with great hiking Shoes since the path was slippery because of free stones. Many locals were well prepared, and most of them had trekking pole. At the first part of trail, we still can find families and young children enjoy their time near the river. As we went uphill, the chance to meet people even rare. Fortunately, The mountains filled with many temples where we can stop by, and take a rest. It took us 3-4 hours return to the entrance. Also 2 hours return way from seoul station. So it would take a day if you would like a hiking experience in Seoul"
Good for hiking,"Around 1 hour on the train from the city. It's really nice to get our of Seoul and see the suburbs and this national park. Most people there are prepared hikers, but it's nice just to go walk around and see some of the temples. There are a lot, but at the entrance you can get a free map, and ask for advise about which route to take."
Nice hike,"View was nice from the top, and the trails were all nicely maintained. Could have had more English signs along the way, as there were a bit of confusions at some junctions especially at the part near the temples and the ranging station as we couldn't read the Korean. There were not much hikers as we were going on a weekday. It was only around 45 min from the city center and so was very convenient and accessible by subway."
Amazing view on top of the mountain,"This place is suitable for nature lover, but bear in mind, please do wear appropriate clothes based on the climate/season you visit that mountain. I wore a winter jacket during winter, but still, the strong wind will make you freeze."
Amazing views and lovely hike ,"This was a really good half a day out. But be careful I would only recommend you do the hike in good weather as most the track up is rock, stones and mud. There are two trails up to the peak a beginner/intimidate and an advanced both which a fun to climb and both have amazing views and temples to stop at along the way The views from the top are incredible but make sure you take some food and drinks with you!"
Beautiful NATURE MOUNTAINS ROCKS VIEWS,"gogogogogo Don't miss out on an amazing trek. Might be a little tricky for those who suffer from hights, but all well if you are with others. Join Meet up group Climbing in Korea, they organise lots! "
climb this mountain with locals,"I visit Seoul and unexpected find this exciting climbing activity. I was a bit worry about the arrangement on the activity, as i don't expect to have this outdoor activity in Seoul, but my worry is gone when i reach there and saw my private guide. I meet him on TravoAsia.com which offer many special and unique activities in Seoul. The climb took a day, so prepare yourself for a day of workout. but the experience was really good and they all speck english. We meet some other travellers as well and end up eating dinner in a traditional restaurant nearby. It was very helpful when you join an activities with local. I strongly recommend that apps. Go check it out. Have a good trip"
"Long trails, suited for any experience level","Despite reading blogs online regarding transportation of bus and train, if you are staying in the northern part of seoul, just take a taxi as it is around the same price.Do check the weather frequently if you are coming, especially in the summer, as the terrain will be several folds harder if it does rain. If you arrive at the base and you see many other people there, you'll know its safe to go. Some routes may be blocked if there was heavy rain during the past few days. I couldn't see a waterfall because of that.Terrain wise, even though the route i took was rather long, seeing Wonhyobong peak and then Baegundae(highest peak @ 836.5m). Despite being relative beginners at hiking, the terrain is very manageable. There aren't any areas where you have to go on all fours to climb. Be warned though that the peak does look a little scary, but there are metal ropes for you to hold onto. Hiking sticks can be easily found near the bases and i got one for 5k won. It is a good investment imo.There are also rock climbing routes that seem well maintained."
family hiking,"This mountain has various hiking trails. Our family of 5, including children aged 10, 8, and 4, hiked 3.2 km to Daedongmoon and back down. It took us about three hours. It was very enjoyable but not so easy for the young one. We hiked without hiking shoes and my wife ended breaking her converse walking shoes. For your best experience, hiking shoes are strongly recommended. There were a couple of running wells along the way. They were refreshing and safe to drink as well."
The most challenging hike I've done- gloriously beautiful!!,"We started our ascent by 730am on a Sunday, there was a nice cool breeze and the shade of the trees covered us most of the way. By the time we were done, the park was super busy and we enjoyed the park before the crowds really hit. I LOVED the route we took up - it was a straight rock scramble for most of the peaks. I never would have found the path (our route for that matter) but our cab driver had just hiked it the weekend before so he recommended we start from the path we did (it was about 200 meters maybe from the Bulgwang subway station). We hiked up to Jokduribong peak first, it took us 25 minutes but we were pushing really hard. (Our can driver said it would take 1 hour). Being naive we thought this was it, but once we got there we looked behind us and saw the rest of the park. It was huge and we had a ton of time to kill so we headed for the next peak. With no map, no trail markers, we just kind of followed a few random hikers and the one trailhead pointing the direction. Thankfully that worked out for us! The next peak we hit was Hyangnobong Peak. Now understand that none of these peaks are SUPER high, but the change in elevation is pretty intense. You will hand over hand climb to the top of most of these peaks. Then we hit Bibong Peak and on to Samobowi (Rock). After Samobowi, we went to Seunggabong Peak and finally reached our summit at Munsubong Peak and down through Daenammun Castle Gate back to the Gugi Information Center. If we had taken the trail from Gugi up and done this hike backwards it wouldn't have been as pretty or fun. That trail is manmade and very foresty. It was more fun to hike up the rock scrambles and pull ourselves up via ropes and metal handrails. At one point, if we slipped we would have plummeted to our death. It was so fun! It took us 3 hours and 40 minutes, but we pushed hard with short few breaks. Absolutely recommend this route!!! I wish we had more time to hit the highest peaks in the park!!"
"Great experience, some planning required","Absolute worth the hike to the peak. Some planning required though, if you decide to go for public transport, there are apt descriptions on how to get there on google. Be prepared to change public transport at least two or three times if you are going there by public transport. If you're going by taxi, please remember to write down a phone number, or install a taxi app, to ensure you'll get a taxi when you're done. As getting a local taxi near the National park is very difficult.In terms of trip length etc, there are multiple paths and trips. Would recommend to go to the peak, but to take some detours to see local attractions (such as building and temples on the way). It is possible to take a different path up and down to the peak. We were told that getting up and down the peak would take 5 hours. We talked with some locals afterwards, which informed us that it was not unusual to spend as much as 9 hours getting up and down, with a lot of rests.If you are going to the top, pack stuff in a backpack, and not a shoulder bag. Also, bring some food and snacks, and minimum 1 - 1,5L of water per person (possibly more if its a really sunny day).In terms of other equipment, hiking shoes is not required, some good sneakers will do. If you have sensitive hands, you might want to bring some gloves for the parts where you have to pull yourself up alongside the wire fence. Bringing children below 10 years to the peak, is possible, if they have previous experience with walking and hiking in mountains. We had a couple of 8-year olds with us. But they had quite some experience from before.Also, make sure someone brings a map, and reads it. It will save you some hassle following and reading signs. There are however, signs everywhere, both in English and Korean."
Worth all the effort,"Its almost 60 kms out of the city and you might need to take 2 -3 transport to reach the place. It's a trekker's paradise but not totally out of reach for others. Yes the last 1 km is quite steep but once you reach the top you will realize its absolutely worth. Better to go in the morning so that you can reach on the top by lunch...take rest and back before 3pm. light clothes, trekking shoes and water. "
The best day you'll spend in Seoul,"Head away from the city for just a day, and spend it hiking with the locals! (Weekends are best for spotting the locals in all their hiking gear, having picnics.)There are a lot of different routes to take, and none of them are particularly tough, so just try one of them. Once you get higher up, you will see the old wall and lots of guard towers/gates.We went on a Saturday, and it was one of the best experiences I have had. We went all the way up to some peak and the view of Seoul was incredible (you can really see how big it is). The best thing was probably on the way down when some of the Koreans started speaking to us and we ended up having a swim and some food/drink with them in/next to a creek."
Peak so beautiful ,The national park is easily accessible via a train from the city then a bus afterwards. Quite a tiring hike but definitely worth it because the views are all around from the peak. :)
"Hiking they said, it will be fun they said","So, got persuaded by friends to hike up Bukhansan. Seems easy on paper to say the least, but that's what they said about Calculus too. Journey to the park itself was pretty manageable and accessible. There was a kind soul handing out free packets of wet tissue near the park entrance too, good start. Slowly realised we were so so ill prepared for the hike. I was in jeans, two of my group were in berms/shorts. We wore running shoes, where traction was not a guarantee in the terrain. And that's not a good thing. Local folks had like hiking shoes, hiking sticks, proper hiking outfit and they were struggling alrdy. Just imagine how we did it without those. Kudos to us indeed. Views were spectacular at the peak. Felt great when u can take a short nap at the peak after the arduous journey up. Then slowly come to the realisation that what goes up must come down. Yup, u would need to take the same route down. Some sections of the hikes are really steep and hardly have any steps or rocks to step on. U just need to grind on the sole of ur footwear and hold on tight to the metal ropes along the way. TL:DR - if you like to take in some fresh air, enjoy some scenery of Seoul at the peak, have a good workout, hike up Bukhansan. If not, stick to reading reviews and start convincing ur friends and urself to go visit Myeongdong instead.Oh, do bring loads of water and some snacks up. Great to have a picnic up there. Wished someone told me that earlier sigh."
Fun hike,"We, going very unprepared, picked the route for advanced hikers and had great fun. There were many shops / stalls selling hiking gears and food at the bottom of the mountain and you can get prepared there. It took us 2 hours to reach the peak. At the beginning the route was very well paved and easy to walk. But as we go up the road has become sandy and slippery. I recommend wearing proper hiking shoes / boots if you plan to get to the peak. There were big trees on the side for most parts of the path and it helped block the strong sun light. The view was great and it was worth the muscle pain that followed haha."
"Great Trekking, Massive Workout","If you head there on a clear day, you would be able to see some spectacular views. Unfortunately, there was a bit of an overcast when I went.The treks are all clearly labeled, so you won't get lost. I hiked up to Daeseongmun and Bogungman which is where the ancient fortress wall is. The roundtrip took about 3 hours to do, well worth the hike and definitely a great workout!"
A fun climb with great views !,"Great park to visit with local hikers of all ages moving at a quick pace.Easily accessible by taking the subway to Dobongsang station.Bring good hiking shoes,light garment and enough water supplies since you will most likely sweat it out on the climb !The hikes are mostly moderate to intense and none require special skills or climbing experience but couch potatoes may consider excessive.."
One of the most beautiful areas around Seoul,"Due to it's closeness to the city, it's a popular weekend getaway destination among locals, as well as expats. We didn't actually walk through the trail but the surroundings are amazingly beautiful, you can get one of the best views of Seoul here. There's a few temples scattered all over the mountain, which is always a delight to visit. The nearby district has a small town feel to it, at the foot of the mountain you can enjoy a cafe at one of the tourist catering places/eateries. The park is extremely well-maintained, all in all, it can be a perfect choice for a quick trip out of Seoul as well as for hiking, obviously. Totally recommended!"
Worth the pain,"My husband and I who are both in our 50's and our 17 year old son decided to hike Bukhansan. We asked a staff to recommend a short trail, so we took a trail that is supposed to take 3 hours. Because of my bad knees and my habit of taking lots of pictures, it took us 5.5 hours. Needless to say it was difficult for me and my husband but not for my 17 yr old son. The view up top is just amazing even on a hazy day. The fortress wall and temple were a delightful bonus. Bring good shoes and lots of water specially on a warm day. There were a few spring water post (Thank God!) along the trail so if you ran out of your supply, make sure to look for them. "
Trekking ,Best of trail in Seoul.Panorama mountain veiw.Iong and short course trails.Wonderful and Amasing trekking. 
Stunningly beautiful area ,"I love this park. I went on a climbing trip here and the area is just jaw droppingly beautiful. If recommend a stop by here for any adventure traveller, or even just for a Sunday afternoon hike and picnic. "
Fantastic hike ,"Spent the day hiking, took a wrong path and got a bit lost, turned a 4km hike to a 12km one, fantastic views the whole way, friendly locals. Great day. "
Beautiful views!,The hike was moderately challenging. There are various trails to climb and peaks you can summit. It was pretty easy to find after getting off the subway- just follow all the people in hiking gear and if you get lost just say Bukhansan to a local and look lost and they will happily point you in the right direction. The views from the peaks were fantastic and the hikes take about 3-4 hours roundtrip. Bring a snack and water so you can relax and enjoy the view at the top!
TOUGH HIKE!,"We're amateur-ish hikers and we decided to tackle one of the trails to get to the top. It was not easy (We've also hiked in Colorado, Peru, etc). Overall a very enjoyable hike though. The area around the mountain is nice with a nice mountain village feel to it. I would highly suggest going early to avoid crowds!THERE IS A VERY EASY TRAIN FROM SEOUL THAT TAKES YOU CLOSE TO THE MOUNTAIN/VILLAGE. DON'T BYPASS THIS."
A short hike and Geumsunsa visit,I did not hike all the way up Bukhansan cos I did not have hiking gear on. The area is peaceful and beautiful. I also visited Geumsunsa temple and attended a short temple life program. Hiking Bukhansan appears to be a popular weekend activity for locals. Come early to avoid crowds. 
Attraction list,I’m lucky able to visit this nice place even needed bit struggle to walk long. If you like outdoor activity this should be on list but if you like to enjoy peaceful circumstance this is not the right place for you
Dare to hike the dinosaur ridge!,"The national park is beautiful. Some trails are easy, some exhausting - so something for everyone. Really astonishing is the trail which crosses the so called dinosaur ridge - because it looks like the stony back of a dinosaur. Really nice, but not really easy to hike. If you´re fit or sometimes hiking you can make it though. Not just for real pros."
Great place for birdwatching,"Was in seoul for 5 days and arranged a trip here to see what I could see. Nice walks, fairly easy but steep at times up to some of the gates on the old fort. A massive park and really close to the city. Nice to see a place where apparently asiatic black bear, serow and leopard cat still roam. Saw marsh tit, nuthatch, jay, mallard, spot billed duck, magpie, flycatcher, and a nice surprise was a few Asiatic chipmunk. Really nice place. However, be warned: lots of hiking enthusiasts that are dressed and geared up for Everest listening to their music really loud from phones! Crazy, was a fairly warm day, we were in jeans and tshirt and trainers, these people were wrapped up in winter gear, hiking poles, felt like an amateur! So you definitely won't be alone here. But lovely none the less."
hike combined with a temple stay at Geumsunsa,"I very highly recommend the temple stay at Geumsunsa, which is right along a path up the mountain. On a lovely two hour hike, I only saw two other people. The view from the temple is astounding."
A great hike. A bit dangerous at times!,"You have to do this -- it's gorgeous. But know that some routes have, say, a chain or rope that you have to use to get up/down, and even when you get to a top point, you still hear the city/traffic sounds, which is odd."
"A tough walk up, beautiful scenery","Spent a day walking up to the Dobong Peak, it was pretty hard but local seniors did it, I should too! It was awesome scenery from 700 meters and walk down was easier :D There re easier routes too and you can always turn back. But definitely worth it!"
Bukhansanseong ,"I hiked to bukhansanseong (bukhansan fortress) which took me approximately 3 hours return. The hike was difficult but the amazing views at the top and feeling of accomplishment were worth it. There's a reason the locals all have hiking poles! There were a few small groups of people and a few other solo hikers. People stopped to say hello. I saw some locals eating a picnic at the fortress, I would definitely recommend that you bring food. Bringing water is also important, but there are springs you can drink from along the path as well.There are plenty of English signs to help you find your way once you are on the trail. You can also pick up an English map at the visitor centre located at the park entrance. Plan to spend the whole day here and dress appropriately - especially shoes. Admission to the park is free, they are open during daylight hours. I took the train to Gireum (subway line 4) and then the 143 bus. Follow the local hikers if you are lost."
Seoul's Wilderness,"I love being able to get to the mountains in Seoul on public transportation. If you are up for a challenge, climbing Bukhansan is a great half/full day activity. I didn't plan my hike when I went, but I would recommend planning a route so you can get to the peak you want to reach with an efficient path. This is a strenuous climb so make sure you are ready to walk a few miles uphill/stairs. I went on a weekday morning from 7am and it was very quiet and peaceful. I didn't see more than 50 people during my climb. I think it's much more crowded on the weekends. Foliage in spring is a little sparse on the mountain, so next time I want to visit in Autumn when all of the leaves change colors."
Get your heart racing with a spot of exercise,"A nice national park which was only a metro and bus ride away from the main city area of Seoul. Took us a couple of hours to make it to the summit. A word of caution, wear proper shoes and not casual shoes like I did. My husband proceeded up to the summit but I stayed back as it was getting cold, rainy and wet- a dangerous combination once you take the final leg up to the summit. I would do this again next time - with proper footwear. "
Baegundae Peak,"I decided to hike this mountain all by myself. Getting to the base was easy. Get off at Gupabal subway stn then take bus 704. If you don't know where to get off, follow the other passengers like I did. Getting to the top was not easy for me as I'm not a hiker. Being all by myself did not help either. The view at the top was amazing! I think hiking Bukhansan would be even more beautiful during Fall season. I took the other way on my descent. You could hire a taxi at the base(2 km) to take you to Suyu stn but I decided to walk to the bus stop( i think it was Ui-dong Bus terminal, bus #120 or 153) then to Suyu stn since I was on a limited budget. My legs were sore for the next 3 days but it was worth it. "
Difficult climb but worth it,"If you enjoy hiking, this is a great experience. My 12 year old son, two of his friends, my 14 year old daughter climbed, and I climbed to the Baekundae peak in early April 2016. It was a challenging climb but worth it at the top. You should go prepared, water, some protein, and ready for a nice climb. Be aware, the is a lot of hiking/climbing on rocks. While there are some hand rails and stairs in specific spots - it is not a maintained walking trail (like you find hiking to the Seoul tower). We went up on one side and down the other. Total time with about 30 minutes at the top was about 5 1/2 hours hiking. Children under 10 will find it difficult. You can take the subway, then bus - very easy."
Beautiful Park -- But Trails Were Not Well Marked,"I had a wonderful day. But I was lost several times. There were no signs in English and I quickly lost the trail I intended to hike. But the scenery was beautiful and the first temple I came upon was stunning--with those iconic, jagged cliffs as a backdrop. "
Mountain range in the middle of Seoul,"Huge national park in the middle of Seoul. Well worth a day trip. Plan ahead, there are several peaks to climb and temples to see, so you should now where exactly you want to go. Easy to get to, usually involves a ride on the underground followed by a short bus trip or walk. Different paths laid out depending on personal fitness. Beautiful and calm."
A nice family outing,The trails are easy to follow and well worn in. The mountains are a nice break from the congestion that is Seoul. The temples within the park are interesting. Avoid going during the weekend. Koreans like to hike and they go by the droves. 
Beautiful views...not for the lazy,"This is an amazing place and we absolutely loved our day here. We decided in advance of arrival to climb up to Baegundae Peak, the highest point in the park. Since we're Colorado natives and frequently climb 14,000 foot mountains back home, we assumed a 2700 foot peak would be an easy/casual climb. However, what we didn't know if that there are at least two entrances to this park. We ended up on the ""harder"" side of the route we had planned. Unfortunately, the Information Center was also out of maps when we arrived, so we only had the little bit of information we had researched ahead of time. I recommend printing out a map ahead of time from the park website just in case you get there and they don't have maps left.From the entrance to the park to the top of the peak was a constant climb. Approximately 4.6km and nearly straight up. Most of the trail is rocks and steps until you get near the top. Near the top it's massive rocks with limited foot holds and cables that you will absolutely need to hold on to in order to pull yourself up. We went on a weekend and it was incredibly busy, but the people were very nice and even with two-way traffic up and down, we were able to hike at our own pace. Be sure to bring plenty of water and snacks as it is a long hike up.On the way down, we found the route we had originally researched and planned. It's less than half the length of the trail we took up and it was a lot less steep. We took the shorter path back down. It was an easy trip down and we soon arrived at the parking lot. You can wait for a taxi or take the shuttle down the hill. We didn't want to wait, so we walked down the road for about 20 minutes to the bus stop. There were plenty of restaurants and outdoor gear shops on both sides of the park if there's something you need. I definitely would bring/buy trekking poles. It would have made our trip a lot easier."
Long Hike,"My family hiked to the peak, it is a very long and time consuming hike, it took roughly three hours for the ascent. The trails are hard on your knees and at points it can be VERY dangerous, as at the top, it is all sheer rock at a very steep pitch and you rely on holding onto a cable with your life. It is a great trip to make. I'd recommend it."
It doesn't mean the mountain from North Korea,I went to the Bukhansan through Bogukmun st.I'm not good at hiking it was enough to see many locals especially Ajummas.It's not easy to imagine there is a huge national park in Seoul.
"Well maintained park - Don't get lost, and Avoid crowds","This park is well maintained and worth a visit. Two tips: be wary of crowds on the weekends, and get a map or local friend to avoid becoming lost. Bukhansan has a variety of trails available, most of which are worthwhile. Koreans love hiking, and traffic can be bumper-to-bumper on weekends, so I recommend going on a weekday. "
Fantastic view!,"Initially I plan to hike the Bukhansanseong Fortress Course.However, information from Bukhansan National Park main website is not so informative. I just follow some hikers and I ended up at Obong Course instead of my initial Bukhansanseong Fortress Course.The Obong course was more tough than I expected, hence, for those who are not prepared may like to reconsider.The view at Yeoseongbong peak and Obong peak is really superb!It make you feel on top of the world.I was a bit lost going down the mountain.Fortunately, I met my survivor, Mr Jung. He and his group of friends offer to show me the way down to the park entrance and direct me to the nearest subway.If wasn't for Mr Jung, I may take very long time to go down the mountain.It was a very great experience!"
Nice view at the peak,"A lot of locals go there for hike. There are quite a numbers of routes, be sure to ask the information counter before proceeding. Can be quite challenging if you are not a season hiker. However the view at the peak is worth the effort. "
worth it,Great hike. Took about 4 hours total. Great views of the city once you reach the midway point. it was a very rewarding hike. I don't think its safe to drink the spring water anymore. I heard an older gentlemen telling his grandson it was fresh spring water years ago but has since changed. Not sure so I would ask the visitor center next time. 
breathtaking,"amazing hiking trip, lot of locals go there, but the views are so worthy, experience you can not buy, only walk for it"
worth the hike but take it easy,"There are couple of routes to get to the top. I suggest you ask the information center before hiking. Being brave and adventurous I hike behind a group of hikers and went up the most advance route. That was one of my biggest regret going the wrong route, I was not expecting it to be so hard. I did not even stretch and boy was I sore the next day. I literally couldn't walk up the stairs and it kind of ruin the rest of my vacation. It's worth it but make sure to take the easy route so you can finish it quickly. It took me a total of 6 hrs to hike up and down and a whole day resting the next day."
Good place for nature lovers,this place is amazing for hiking especially since its really close to the city and you can get there easily . once you get there you leave all the hassle of the city and you find your self immediately inside nature and fresh air. the roads are maped and it has good facilities 
Very tough climb but worth the visit!,I chose the easier course however it is still quite tough for me as an amateur hiker. I took 3~4 hours to finish the course and I was met with magnificent view. Do take a walk around if you do not wish to have any strenuous exercise!
Great place for hikes and views,"If you enjoy hiking and national parks, Bukhansan is a MUST! Take the subway to ""Dobongsan"" then go west towards the main entrance. If you go on a weekend, you're sure to have a few Korean hikers to follow. I did the climb up to Jaunbong peak, which was challenging even for an experienced hiker if you take the most difficult route (including ropes, rock scrambling, etc), but there are plenty of options for varying skill levels -- easy to hard. After your hike, enjoy a meal and well earned beer or soju in the ""hiker village"" community surrounding the entrance. You can also pick up any gear you'd ever need here -- boots, poles, tents, gloves, jackets, and more. "
"Beautiful, historical, close to the city","Bukhansan is fantastic. It's quite close to various parts of Seoul by subway and bus (the city has grown around the sides of the national park so you could hike across it and end in a very different area from where you started) and yet it is a grand, majestic and natural space.In terms of hiking there are some tough but perfectly manageable courses, the peak of Baegundae being the toughest. But there are also pleasant valley trails that are easy on the knees and pleasantly shaded by trees. A real highlight is the ruined gates of the old Bukhansan fortress wall, some of which have been restored. It gives an historic dimension to a natural experience. "
This was my favorite site in Seoul,"I hiked here recently on a rainy day, and despite the inclement weather, this was by far my favorite activity during my visit to Seoul. As other reviewers have mentioned, if you plan to summit the peaks, you are in for a difficult hike. But what they don't mention is that the lower trails are easy, and in some cases even paved, and offer some beautiful views in their own right. I think that this free attraction, which is easily reached from downtown Seoul, is worth visiting for anyone, regardless of physical abilities, for that reason.To get here, take Subway Line #1 to Dobongsan station. It's 18 stops, about 40 minutes, from Seoul station. After you exit the subway station, follow the hordes of people dressed in hiking clothes through a market selling hiking gear and food to the park entrance, about a 10-15 minute walk. There, you will find a ranger station where you can pick up a map and mark out a route depending on your hiking abilities and the amount of time you'd like to spend there. The ranger who assisted me made a tremendous effort to help me despite a language barrier and my lack of knowledge of rain in the forecast later in the day. His patience was immense and appreciated. I decided to hike to Madangbawi (a large rock with some good views, it seems), which he advised was an easy hike. The bad news: the maps available at the ranger station are not very good. The good news: you will encounter many other hikers who can help you find your way, as I did. The wonderful people I met on the trail hiked with me to my destination and back. Total hiking time was about 2 hours and the views were wonderful. I would say that it's not an easy hike, more in the moderate spectrum of difficulty.A few mostly commonsense tips: bring your own water, and don't skimp on the amount; if it will rain, bring a raincoat and an umbrella; wear sturdy shoes with good traction; wear sunscreen and sunglasses in sunny weather; and bring food with you. Some hikers brought poles but I didn't and made it just fine."
Great hike not far from Seoul,Great break from Seoul CBD. Possible to get there by train - approximately 45 minutes and another 10 minute walk from the train station on arrival to the park entrance. Various different paths to choose from - some treks more strenuous than imagined but the view is worth the effort. 
Prepare for a meal!,Great view and not too far from Seoul. Walking up 1.5-2 km to take a break at the beautiful antique temple. Then go to the rooftop of the Seoul!! Best experience at Seoul. 
Breathtaking - literally,"My friend and I hiked Baekundae Peak, the highest peak in Bukhansan, and what a trek it was! The park was easy to reach, just take a bus from the metro station. We thoroughly enjoyed the hike and the spectacular views, but it was probably the most difficult hike I've ever attempted. The trail goes from mild slopes to intensive stone steps to scaling sheer rock with the aid of a rope. Towards the top, everyone had hiking poles and chains on their shoes because the summit was icy. We were a little under prepared for the difficulty of the hike, but we persevered and the views were well worth it. I recommend climbing Baekundae if you enjoy an intensive hike. If you are looking for a casual stroll in which to snap a few photos of a view, Baekundae is not for you."
Great day hike in Seoul,"Stayed in Seoul a few days and went to the top of this mountain. It will take around 4-5 hours and is well worth it. Very nice views from the top. its a bit challenging in spots, but not too difficult. We had beef rib soup at a restaurant at the bottom after the hike and then went for sauna and massages on Itaewon St. Very pleasant day in Seoul."
One of best Mt. In Seoul,"If you love hiking but don't have enough time to explore other side of Korea, you must visit Bukhansan Mt.You'll love it for sure."
Hiking and views,Don't underestimate the time and difficulty level of the trails based on the appearance or age of the local hikers. These are steep trails (mostly shaded) with some rock-hopping in places. The views at the top are well worth the effort and it is a truly beautiful national park.
Wonderful Park for trekking,"A lot of trekking options in this excellent park, near Seoul. I have done two hikes so far and I will keep on trying new treks."
Beginners to Advanced Hikers,"Just a stone throw away from Seoul. The main road to the base entrance is lined with hiking stores and restaurants so even if you do not have hiking gear and equipment at first, you can buy some. Excellent sceneries, multiple peaks to hike and offers varied views."
Had one hard spot to hike,"Went there with my professor from Uni and had a good time hiking. Nice view and has several different paths. Honestly, had a really hard time going down but was so ashamed when old ladies and men were constantly passing me."
Nice hiking place not far from Seoul,"I went to the main peak, but there are plenty of other trails to try. The view was amazing and the hike wasn't too difficult. It took me about 40min by subway to get to the start of the trail. Many Koreans regularly go to this place and bring food to eat at the top, so if you're lucky, you can find new friends and have a picnic together. "
"Breathtaking scenery, with various trekking trails to choose from","This was one of my best experience while travelling in Seoul. I travelled with a small group of friends and it was easy to access the park entrance. We hiked up to one of the lower peaks and spent some time at the peak to rest, talk and soak in the scenary. It's ideal to plan your trekking trip as there are several entrances to start from. Make sure you wear proper trekking attire and shoes as the terrain can be quite challenging especially nearing to the peak. And it's good to pack drinking water and some food to hydrate and nourish when you reach the several rest stops along the trails or even at the peak."
"Nice views, satisfying climb, treacherous and icy at the top but glad I did it!","Went during the last week of December, up the route to the highest peak. The signs were in Korean mostly so we accidentally went up the intermediate - advanced route instead of the beginner route. It was very cold, and things got a big snowy and icy as we progressed. At the top, you are climbing up rock face. There are wire cables to haul yourself up and hold onto and steps hewn into the rock in some places. It was icy, and my friend who had worn runners which had hardly any grip could not get any traction at all in some places. I was wearing boots so I was okay, but there was a couple parts where we slipped and if we hadn't been hanging onto the cable we would have probably slipped off the side and fallen to either death or serious injury. I was glad I did it, but we definitely should have been more prepared. If you are going up in winter, bring gloves (that are able to grip cable), hiking boots or shoes with good tread (maybe ice spikes as well), a hat to cover your ears, and enough water and snacks for 6 hours. You need to be in recently decent shape, especially at the top where you need upper body strength to help pull you up. We started at about 10 and got down at about 4. There were many people also doing the hike, so we just followed other people from the station to get to the mountain and back, as per other trip advisor reviews."
Breathtaking Views,It was so nice to get out of the city and hike. We went on a really clear day and could see the entire city and some beautiful mountains. I would love to come back and go all the way to the top (We only did the gate route because we got there too late)
Must do for Trekkers,"The five main treks of Bukhansan are all doable within 5-6 hours up and down for relatively healthy trekkers. Most beautiful is Obong Trek and most dramatic is the Bukhan Fortress route. You can get off the orange line subway at Gupabal for Bukhan Fortress route and Bulgwang for Obong route. Just follow the hikers dressed for Himalayan adventures!If you wish to do all of the peaks over some days, it is easy to find jimjilbang (hot springd with sleeping rooms) near all of the entrances to the park. Cheapest and most relaxing way to soothe tired muscles after the treksCarry bottled water and snacks. Wear sensible shoes!"
Mangwolsa Temple ,"Walking up to this temple and back is probably the highlight of my trip to Seoul. Beautiful, serene temple, and majestic views all the way. "
"Excellent hiking experience, easy access","One of my favorite hiking places in the world. Easy access via public transit, loads of restaurants near the Dobong Metro Station, sweet views along the ridge lines and beautiful temples. If one even mildly likes outdoor activities, then this is a place that should be on the list of attractions if visiting Seoul. "
"A bit of nature in Seoul, but crowdy","Want to find some peacefull place with mother Nature ? Don't go there :-)Although it is crowdy and really difficult to find peaceful hike there, this park is accessible by subway from Seoul (45min from center), easy walk (except for vertigoers). Count 3h on site for back trip to the summit. The view is extraordinary and you are in a park, so it is pleasant anyway!"
"Beautiful & picturesque views, worth the walk.",PROS: Best stop of my South Korea trip. Beautiful place. Hiked alone and enjoyed every moment. Every views were worth the snap. Baegundae Peak was beyond amazing. CONS: Long walks but you'll regret it if you're not going to put this on your itinerary in Seoul.LOCATION: 3/5PRICE: 5/5HOSPITALITY: 4/5ATTRACTIONS: 5/5
"Was lighter in the past, but...","Back in the day, Bukhansan was only available to people, who knew, how to get there. Nowadays, everything is arranged: Transport to get ther, being there, finding places... There are telekommunication towers blocking the view and still...It is there, you have a good view, it is very nice, if you are early, etc. Do not miss one of the best views of the City!"
It is amazing. ,"It is very excellent snow trekking. I was reluctant to evaluate but many people want to go to the Mt. Seoraksan but too far so this Mt. Bukhansan is very good. Because it is inside the Seoul. You need to be well prepared: With emergency food, crampons, spats, Trekking shoes and clothes, lunch etc. especially in the winter. :) "
Great hiking place.,If you are a fan of climbing or hiking a mountain this is the place for them. Mountain is not that high and rough. And its national park cleanness will help you take a deep rest. 
great view,"satisfy with the view, I use cable car to go up, not many people. I think bcos of weekdays. overall, really enjoy the trip!"
Red and Gold,"A hike through the park at the start of winter offered a kaleidoscope of colours, fresh air and unforgettable views. "
Great for hiking and spectacular view!,"Can recommend to do hiking, its easy to find a starting point and then on the way there are always maps that show you the direction. Great view from the top."
Not that impressive,"We took the Uiryeong-gil. It was recommend as ""Nature Lover"" trail. And it was supposed to be the peak of foliage, but not that impressive at all. I think the short climb to Seoul Tower at Nansan has better view.The trail is very easy. The website says that to take this trail ,one need to register in advance. However, I guess autumn is low season, so no registration needed. The trail took us around one and a half hour to finish. You get to see the 5 peaks."
"Great hike, stunning view, experience Korea's loved hobby","Koreans love hiking. Feel local by taking on Mt. Bukhan. If you are diehard for the local experience, then take your lunch including hot soup and side dishes up the mountain too. Forgot some essential hiking gear? All you need can be found in the various shops on the foot of the mountain. Bukhansan National Park is immensely beautiful, with also a temple to visit if you take certain paths where you can do a temple stay. Most people want to reach the peak of the mountain however. And there is the possibility for extreme sports for daredevils unafraid of taking on vertical lines.I took a trail of about 6/7km from one side of the mountain to the peak and going down the other side. Hiking path is very accessible, though on some intermediate/expert levels it does include taking on steep paths for which you might need your hands for extra support, though there is no real hoisting yourself up involved. I was a bit daunted by the word ""expert"" since I never hiked before coming to Korea, but even 70 year old ladies took that trail on, so why shouldn't you? Do expect to feel your calves burn. There was a queue up to the peak of the mountain at the last bit to the peak, which was a funny interesting experience. Everybody neatly lined for the same Kodak moment. That view however was breathtaking and so worth it! All in all took me 5 hours.Excellent day trip!"
Love this place!,"Amazing hiking trails and some breathtaking views, paths can be easier or more challenging, depending on which you prefer. Watch out for 100 year old koreans who can about 5 times faster than a fit twenty year old!This is a beautiful chance to escape from the city, while staying in the city. Good in summer and absolutely breathtaking in winter (just bring crampons for grip...they sell them at the base of the mountain)If you like the outdoors and a bit of fresh air in your lungs then don't miss out on this"
Incredible hills so close to city,"Outstanding park, great views if no smog or fog. Clear sign-posting, useful to pick up map first though. Generally english signs at a reasonable frequency. Well maintained tracks"
Avoid the weekend,"I did this hike on a Sunday which proved to be one of my least smart ideas. It was so so busy, the last 50meters took around 30minutes with the queue, but other than that, I thought it was awesome. The views were great and the colouring of the leaves was beautiful. The hike was more challenging than I thought it would be and I would recommend boots. I did it in my sneakers and found it very slippery in places. Very good!"
Breathtaking view,How to go: take the metro to Gupalan Station and boarded the bus 704/34 to the Bukhasan National Forest. Don't forget to bring water and food in case you may tried and need to refill your energy. Proper clothes and good shoes. Hiking to Bukhansan peak around 5 km. There're many Korean hikers on weekends.Suggest your guys go to hiking in Autumn. Very very beautiful view . For avoid climbing back in the dark you should come in the morning cause it's take time around 5-6 hours up there. Highly recommended escape from the city.
Climbing in Autumn weather,Was there a couple days ago for my first hike up to Begundae peak. Took the metro from my hotel nearest station to Gupalan Station and boarded the bus 704 to the Bukhasan National Forest. Detail Map of the various trails can be purchased at 1000Kwon at the Park Information Counter. I attempted the 4.2 km trail which was told to be the easy for beginners novice like me. There are street vendors selling food stuff that you can bring for a picnic lunch which I bought a sushi roll for 2000 Kwon. I bought a hiking stick for 6000 Kwon too seeing it as essential for the climb. The road leading to the start of the rocky climb was scenic in cool Autumn weather passing a few Buddhist temples along the way and including the West Gate of the Bukhasan Fortress. After the temple the real rocky trail starts and it was pretty challenging mid way as the rocks are not flat step and one need to be constantly focus on which step stone or crevices that could support myself to climb up the rocky mountain heaving a heavy back pack ( carrying an SLR camera with water) . Being a novice it was pretty daunting seeing many experienced climbers bypassing you quickly and jumping like jackrabbits to the top. I purposely planned to hike up on a Monday to avoid the crowd which was publicised widely. This gave me ample space to take it slowly and steadily to the top of the mountain. Instead of the reported 2 hours time frame I took nearly double that as I was awed by the picturesque autumn foliage along the way and took opportunity to enjoy the scenic moments and shoot pictures along the way. Coming down was a damper as my shoes werent so suitable for sharp rocky terrain but I managed to climb down rather carefully and slowly to avoid slipping and falling into the ravine! My knees hurt a little coming down but with rest it healed and I dare say it made my knees stronger now! 
Korean Hospitality and Breathtaking Views,"This was one of my favorite things on my vacation to Korea. I recommend it for anyone who wants to feel like they are part of Korea and do things that the Koreans do. Like other travelers have mentioned, finding the trail was quite easy. Get off at the Dobongsan subway station and follow the herd of hikers. I went on a weekday and there were still plenty to find my way there. Be sure to stop in at the information center. The Rangers were so helpful and entertaining. They also provide a map that is in English with the major landmarks. This comes in handy to make sure you are on the right path once you head up the mountain. Shortly after setting off I was adopted by a group of hikers who I walked with most of the way to Jubong peak. The hike was of an intermediate level, not too hard (but I am a pretty regular hiker) and it was steep in some areas. After rain there could be some slippery portions so watch your step. They were not going all the way to the top but pointed me in the right direction to continue to the peak. On my way down I was adopted by another couple of hikers. They didn't speak any English like the first group but helped me find my way down and made sure that I didn't slip on all of the leaves. The views at the top were incredible and well worth the trek up. It was a bit chilly on top but felt great after the work going up. Definitely with the trip if you want to get into the natural beauty of Korea and away from the city."
"Excellent, not to challenging.","Went on a weekday, although the there were still lots of people in the bus and a short queue there were not too many people. We went from Bukhansanseong to Baegundae peak. Good views and, as it is very developed, you don't need anything other than comfy shoes, water and maybe some snacks. If you have moderate fittness then this route will only take a couple of hours, but give your self more time as you will want to look around and there are lots of small detours you can make. We followed the advice given by others and went in the morning which worked out well as we got a little off the beaten track and climbed about, meaning we stayed most of the day. We also took bus 704 from Gupabal station. Looked like buses were very regular and both 704 and 34 stop at the enterance. Highly recommended escape from the city."
"Innsbruck, Gangnam style","If you prefer to avoid tourist traps and would rather see what the locals do in their spare time, then this is for you. Other posts adequately describe how to locate the main park entrance gate from Dobongsan Railway station. You'll notice other train travellers all decked out in the latest hiking fashion. I'm told they are not so prevalent midweek, but on the weekends there was no doubt you were heading in the right direction. The main gate would not be more than 500 metres from the station. The short walk that can only be described as Innsbruck done Gangnam style. This area is worth the effort to see on its own. It is unique. The walk from the station is lined with shops and market stalls selling all range of hiking and outdoor gear. All you'll ever need and plenty that you won't. The locals obviously frequent these stores. I did the short loop walk as I arrived there to find it was raining, which caught me out. This loop is an easy walk, for anyone of reasonable fitness, of about 5.2 kms. It passes through natural forest settings and past a couple of Temples and their gardens. This walk is well sign posted and could be easily navigated even without knowledge of the Korean language. I'd recommend doing this walk early. Aiming at getting back to the entrance gate around 11-12 o'clock. Then sit back for something to eat and watch the endless parade of happy locals pass by you. A highlight of my trip."
Highlight of my trip!! Must go here!!! ,"I suggest to go here in the morning. We went here after lunch. We went through different mountain peaks ands its amazing!!! wear a proper hiking outfit, hehe. Cus i just wear a casual one. and.. You know, we are still on the mountain top at about 5pm and it got really scary to be trapped above! Thank God! There are hikers who helped us go down before sun down! But its a great and memorable experience Overall! "
amazing trail,"very nice trail, better in a clear day. back and forth with a break of 30 min on top can be done at 4.5 hour. 2 liter of water is enough + some energy snacks and fruits. transportation: Gupabal Station (Subway Line 3), Exit 1.Take Bus 704 bound for Bukhansanseong Fortress (북한산성).Get off at the Bukhansan Mountain entrance bus stop.great view from top!"
Amazingly beautiful!,Best views! It's a serious hike to the Baegundae Peak! We took the Bukhansanseong Fortress Course up but ended up taking a different path down. Bring food and water as there will not be any chances to buy it after you leave the entrance. Also in the autumn you will want to layer your clothing as it will be hot as your hiking up but cold at the top!And recommend going on a weekday otherwise you'll have to contend with thousands of Korean hikers.
Totally amazing for hiking lovers!,"It is very crowded, but it worth it! Take a trip to Baegundae Peak. It is the highest mountain at Bukhansan. The view is amazing. Not suitable for small kinds, the trip is is in some places very advanced. Take good shoes and food, u can eat at top of the hills. It is 800 ascendence of 5 km."
A view like no other,"It is a free attraction and is very popular in Seoul. To avoid the crowd, we went for an evening hike. I would not recommend doing this to everyone as it is a little bit dangerous due to the darkness. However, the view at the top was breathtaking. There was beautiful Seoul at night on one side, and darkness on the other. An experience we will not forget!"
"take time to go there, you wont regret it","30mm by metro from downtown, I went there 20 times over 5 years. I took many foreigners there and everyone enjoyed it. Plan your trail, with water, food and good shoes. You can buy all at the bottom of the trail. Go see the 1000 Buddhas and enjoy the experience, or for the most adventurous, climb the highest mountain (BaeKumBae) in Seoul and see a breathtaking view of the city"
Hiking with locals,A wide range of hiking routes at different levels. Easy access by public transportation like metro and buses. Clear signage and map along the path. You will see how Korean love hiking.
Highlight of my trip to Seoul,"We love hiking and do a lot in Hong Kong. So baegundae peak in this park was an absolute must. It took us 5 hours in total. So be ready to spend half a day there. We started from the Jeongneung Information centre. Before you get to the information centre, get your snacks and water. There is a lady on the main street who will do you coffee and we also bought boiled eggs. She is on the same street that sells all kind of mountain and hiking gear. Take gloves, you will need it. Make sure you have enough water, fruits and snacks (no littering, so a bag to put your litter too). The information centre has a map in Korean. But you can ask them to pinoint the various points (gates). We did the following route - Daesong Mun Gate - Bogungmun gate - Daedong Mun - Youngammun - Baegundae peak. 4 hours to the top, more time if it is crowded.The climb is challenging but magical. Try to stay on the well trodden path. You can get lost if you leave the trail. We had a Korean guy who kind of adopted us. He didn't say much but just walked with us. All we knew was that he was going to Daesong Mun gate. But he decided to walk with us upto B. gate. We shared our snacks with him as he revealed some look out points with us. Walking along the fortress wall to Bog....Peak has amazing views, but it is a stony path. I have runner's knee and that didn't help especially going down ( I really had to watch out as my next marathon is only 2 months away). But spectacular panoramic view of Seoul from Bog...Peak. Then it is an undulating climb, fairly easy but once you cross Youngammun and there is baegundae challenging your spirit. here you are clambering onto flat granite rocks, holding onto steel ropes (that's why you need gloves). IT is a challenge so worth conquering. It is steep so just be cautious, move your body forward and heel down. Just climb. At the peak, the views of Seoul are magnificent. We were there on a particularly perfect hiking weather day - blue skies, clouds and no humidity. Just perfect. At the very top, you know it was all worth the 836 metres you just climbed! Make your way down and depending on the time, you can choose the route you want to take back. We arrived at the Ui DOng side where there is a temple. The temple bus will take you down to the main street to further catch transport.If you love the outdoors and hiking is your thing, this is a must"
Breathtaking view,"It was my first time hiking a mountain , thus it was a great challenge.The steps get steeper when we were reaching the peak and climbing down was tedious. Luckily we met a helpful ajusshi who helped us navigate the way .Other hikers were cheering for me when I looking worn-out. There's a small stream at the end of the trail, we soaked our strained feets in the ice cooled water was relaxing ~"
Fresh air and natural splendor right in Seoul,Beautiful hike can be had right within Seoul. Park is densely wooded and a moderately strenuous climb should one choose to ascend. Allow several hours to include a good hike.
Seoul is also about nature!,"having been to seoul a few times, it was great to do an activity outside the city. The walk along the fortress walls was one of the highlights of our stay. do your research about how to access it and take your passports as it is a security area and you have to sign in and out of the wall. "
Nature at its best,"Wonderful nature! I love hiking in the mountains around Seoul. There are literally hundreds of little trails snaking through the mountains and if you go with your gut it can bring you to some amazing sights The air is clean, the birds and nature is loud around you and it is not busy on a weekday."
Great place to visit!!!,"In Uijeongbu for a short time? You have to visit Bukhansan National Park and take a hike up to the summit. From Uijeongbu Station it's a short 15-min ride to Dobongsan Station. As described to me, ""step off the train, exit Gate #1 and follow the ajummas and ajussis in hiking gear"". Literally. No hiking gear? Don't worry, you can get the items you need at a decent cost ($-$$$) on the way. There's an extensive market area before you hit the park entrance. The views are breathtaking, lots of photo opportunities. There are at least three temple areas that make spectacular photos. If you can, get Mr. Koo to give you the introductory brief. A challenging hike or climb. Well worth your time."
Accessible and a place for great workout,"Did my hike today. This is one of the more accessible mountain from the city. I reached here by taking the metro to Gireum station and bus 110B till the last stop. Just follow the koreans professionally dressed in their hiking attire and you wont be lost. A pity the map at the beginning of the entrance is written only in korean. It wasn't detailed enough on how the exact route to take to reach baegundae peak. Hence, it was pretty much guesswork most of the way. Along the way, stop by for a breather and to snack. Some of the local people even offered us food and they were also very friendly. Good to trek with some friends so that you wont feel lonely. Overall, a great workout. It is also very clean mountain as people take their trash along with them instead of throwing it everywhere."
Saturday in September,"Went with a couple of friends. As everyone else stated, it takes a couple hours to get to the top but wow, is it worth it!! On the steeper portion of the climb/hike there are staircases and cable rails to guide and assist your momentum. Well worth the sweat. I would gladly do it again. Take a lunch and plenty of water for the hike up. You can relax at the many flat spots for lunch. There is a small store on the way down the other side that sells drinks, so you're not in land of the lost by any means."
Challenging but very rewarding,I went here during the week as I heard there are many people hiking at the weekend.It's very quiet and the air is way better than inside the city. You can even see some animals like squirrels butterflies and birds.Sometimes there are rocks you have to climb on ot walk over.The way is very steep at times so you need good shoes especially when climbing down again. I wore sneakers and were sliding around a lot.Also take enough water with you and something to eat as -depending with route you take- there are no places to buy stuff.It takes about 2 or 3 hours to be on the peak but the view there is simply amazing and a nice reward for the hard work climbing to the top
Free weekend in Seoul? Go hiking in the city!,"Easily accessible by metro (+a short walk), this park is a great place to hike. Take the map at the start and use it along the way if you want to make a change from the recommended route. I suggest reaching Dobongsan peak and from there hike along the Podea ridgeline if you have time. There are some cables to use on this ridge but you can bypass it if you want (in fact there is a sign recommending tourists to take the bypass. The hike up is full of stairs and in summer it is very humid so make sure you take enough water with you (and maybe a towel because you're going to sweat a lot). There are signs on the way indicating number of kilometers from place to place. When I hiked there the view from the top was very hazy, I hope you'll get a clearer view - enjoy!"
Amazing hillside walks...,"We came here by mistake.. insufficient instructions to the cab driver. The mountains are beautiful and we arrived to hear chanting at several of the Buddhist Temples. The temples are beautiful, done in teal, blue, red, pinks."
Great nature almost in the city,"Such a great forest, easy to reach from the city center. Offers loads of hiking possibilities and mountain climbing! "
Take the expert route for a real challenge!,"I climbed the expert route and it was very tough! like i have never sweated so much in my life, but once you get to about 500m, you can get to the different peaks very easily! bring lots of water!!"
Like stairs?? This is the place for you,"We had a good time and getting here was easy enough. But we climbed stairs for and hour and a half for underwhelming views. Nice break from the city, but meh."
Great views over the city,"Requires a certain level of fitness, and the signs get less English the further you venture from the start. The Koreans who were the only ones we saw on the walk roam all over the mountain, so try and remain on the widest most used path. The higher up you go the more spectacular the views become, so if you have the time go to the top, which considering the stops for photos can take between 2 to 3 hours. The path does rise up and down and at places you will find wooden steps to help your ascent, but be warned at times you will have to make your way over boulders. Closer to the top you will find the remains of the old forts that use to watch over the valleys, which give commanding views of the city. Take water and food with you as there is none available on the route, and you will be hungry after the climb. Overall we found it an enjoyable experience and would recommend it for anyone if they like hiking, if you don't please disregard this review. "
Go Hiking!!,"I like this Mountain. You can choose many different trails, and each trail has its own beauty. Check out some traditional Korean food while you making your way to go down."
An Escape from the City,"We took some time to hiking the trails on our trip to Seoul, and it was well worth it! It is very serene, it is hard to believe you are so close to the city. A must see if you love the outdoors!"
Very good!,"Really ice, with great views and photos. The drive up made you feel a bit sick though. I really enjoyed it. I would recommend going there."
Go for a swim,"Amazing place for a hike, get away from the city and after a good rain many sport you can go for a swim in the mountains. At the end of trail many restaurants to enjoy traditional Korean cuisine."
Beautiful!,"This is worth the hike! If you're on the fence about climbing a mountain, I encourage you to go for this one.The only complaint is that I needed to use my inhaler halfway up. :P But that's on me, not the mountain! I met a couple of kindly older gentlemen and we shared a picnic under the trees at our highest point of our trip.Great view of Seoul!"
Great hike,"wonderful hike, lots to see and a great workout. Really a must do when in the area!Dont miss the chance to visit."
Polluted Heights,"If it is your first time here I suggest climbing the tallest peak. Just get on bus 704 from whatever station is closest and walk through main gate, you will see the signs. It is around 4 km to the top.Entrance is free, there is no food or drinks to buy after the road is no longer paved, so bring enough water for 2-3 hours of hiking (there is a stream near the top that a lot of Korean people drink from, they said it was safe but I didn't risk it, especially with all the rubber smell from the shops you can smell).If you go at a good pace you will do this in 2 hours, plus the time you stay at the top. The rocks are slippery when wet so be advised. The restaurants and cafes around the base are overpriced, but I recommend Cafe 1%, the desserts were awesome. The base has around 20 different shops selling mountain climbing gear... pretty pointless, you could do this in flip flops if it's not raining... but 90% of the Korean people were all decked out for this short hike.The view at the top is so-so, which is why I gave 3/5. I prefer natural beauty, cities only at night. You couldn't even see the city barely because of all the pollution. Pictures of the surrounding mountains were also not good. It has been this way every time I've climbed here and Namsan, no matter winter or summer."
Bukhansan... Free leg day👟,Go to gupabal station and take bus 704. Then prepare to spend several hours conquering Bukhansan. The road was long so bring sufficient water; 3-4 Liter should be adequate. The forest walk was uneven and full of rocks and dirts and remember this: climbing is tiring but it is less risky while descending down was easier but more dangerous. The mountain hike is the grand finale of the trip as you can see Seoul clearly from the top. Bear in mind that you need to be extremely cautious near the peak as there is no proper place to step but they do provide us with ropes to grab on into.prepare your camera as the view either at the top or in the forest are both worth the taking. Don't rush! my friend sprain his knee when he slipped on our way back.P.S. You might want to consider carrying extra ration or have lunch first before start climbing. remember there is no public toilet except halfway through the climbGood Luck!
Natural refuge from the bustling city,"If you aren't so much a city person, you must go here to get away from the hustle and bustle of Seoul. If you are an outdoorsy person, but don't have enough time for one of Korea's many gorgeous national parks, then this is a nice alternative, just a short bus ride from Seoul.From the Bukchon Hanok village, we took a bus up to Bugaksan mountain. From the bus stop, it is a short hike until you reach the old city wall. While not as impressive as the Great Wall of China, it was still an impressive wall that followed the jagged mountain tops and encircled the city, and offers beautiful scenic views and great views of the city. Because there is a military area somewhere along the wall, they check your IDs at a certain point. This place closes at 3 pm so make sure you go early enough to get through the gate at 3 pm. In my opinion, best to visit in autumn when the mountains are red and orange, but I'm sure its beautiful all year round."
Great way to spend a day,"It is not banff or anything however to be able to find such a place in the bustle of a busy city like seoul can be truly refreshing. A great contrast from all the shopping and city life, to be able to be outdoors and enjoy nature. There are some fantastic views. Be prepared to walk and ascend fast. Take your time if you are even slightly out of breath or out of shape. "
Beautiful and scenic,"There are several different paths to hike so I highly recommend you look into thr paths first to determine which level is for you. The beginning paths are nice and paved and at a low incline. As you get higher up some paths leads you through rough rocky path ways that could be a bit dangerous and definitely physically straining on those who arent use to hiking. Dress appropriately with running shoes and and bring lots of water (there are places in between where you can buy small bottles of water as well but once you get higher up and the trail gets rougher, theres no water avail). Many older koreans seems to go through these trails alot but are fully equipped with walking sticks and etc. Going up its very scenic and the tall trees offer you shade so its not too hot even in the middle of july. Hope everyone enjoys the view!"
Amazing Place! Nice People!,"Last November 2014, my friends and I went on vacation to Seoul, Korea. I decided I wanted to hike Bukhansan National Park because it is the most visited scenery in Seoul. I have never hiked a mountain solo, but none of my friends wanted to come with me. But that wasn't a problem at all! I learned that Dobongsan gets a lot of visitors even on weekdays so I wouldn't really be by my own self. I met a lot of people on the way up, a couple of ""ajussi"" who kept me company in the most difficult last 1 kilometer, and an ""ajumma"" from the temple who offered me kimbab and coffee and how can I forget ""abeoji"" who was really nice to drop me off at the subway station. Korean hospitality at its best! How can I forget those Korean ajummas and ajussis in their full climber outfits! I felt under-dressed! Overall, it was a very relaxing experience. I love nature and it was the best part of my visit to Seoul."
Beautiful,Beautiful and exhilarating hiking. Quick and easy way to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city.
Get out of the jungle and into the forest,"This is one of the most memorable things that we did during our visit to Seoul. Mr Koo the park ranger at the entrance is one of the most energetic and helpful guys I met in the whole of Korea. He gave great instructions and tips on which routes to take up the mountains and even offered to come personally in the 112 helicopter if we critically injured ourselves. The path up the mountain is pretty good and would be achievable for people who are not experts, despite the signs. I wouldn't recommend the very top for the less fit people, it takes a bit of upper body strength to pull yourself up the ropes/rails for the last 30 metres. At the top, the view is great. Overall our round trip took 3 hours and 40 minutes with some needed stops. The atmosphere within the park is quite good, although not as pleasant as some other hiking I have done in France and Australia etc. It was still a great break and you get a great fashion show of locals in full hiking gear sporting every colour of the rainbow.Take the metro to Dobongsan metro station and then cross Dobong-ro on the overpass and then pedestrian crossing and head south 100 metres and turn onto Dobongsan-gil. Follow this wide road past all of the hiking shops including Mountain Hardwear, Patagonia, Mammut etc. Keep going straight and you will eventually find the park entrance after about 1km. If you are hungry just cross Dobong-ro and go straight when you come out of the station, many BBQ places which was maybe not the best idea before a large hike."
"2 hours up, great views","There are several summits that can be scaled. Accessible by metro. Dobong-san is where we hiked from, a major access point. 2 hours up for us as a determined middle age couple, one of who has never previously hiked. In July it was very sweaty and we drank 2 litres of water each going up, but it was relatively easy to head up with normal sneakers. You'll be sore the following day. Great views from the summit of Jaunbong."
Breathtaking views and great hiking place!,"If you are up for a hike and want to see some awesome views, then you really have to visit Bukhansan National Park!It was truly amazing and I didn't expect anything.As I went there solo, I would recommend you to go there with some friends, which are not frightened by heights and are brave!It was quite rough to get up there, if you have no clue at all, but it was pretty cool.Must see, when you are in Seoul ;)"
Hiking worth the while ,"The trails are easily accessible and well entertained. Yes it's hard to climb to the peaks, but it's absolutely worth the while! The view is worth the while when you are up at the top! Absolutely stunning views! "
Wonderful!,"We climbed one of th peaks and had a terrific view of Seoul. We meet a lot of Koreans on the way (not too many though, we hiked on a Sunday). It felt like we did something Korean, and it was definitely a nice change from the noisy city. "
"A Total ""Mountain Top"" experience!","What an experience! My friend and I climbed Wonhyobong and Baegundae Peaks. The trails were amazing-difficult, but do-able for those who don't hike regularly. We met lots of cool people who seemed burdened with too much equipment, but it turned out they were right-it rained on us and they were totally prepared. Make sure to check the weather before going!We exited Gupabal station at Exit 3 and took the #704 bus until Bukhansanseong Stop (6 stops later) and then followed the trail on the left of the trailhead. Highly recommend this route to anyone willing to hike for 3+ hours and see some awesome views!"
An amazing view that is worth the climb,"This turned out to be the highlight of my trip to Seoul. A great way to enjoy nature and it was a good workout too! We took the metro and alighted at Gupabal station, then transferred to bus 704. We didn't have to worry about missing our stop because the bus was filled with local hikers all decked out in their hiking gear. Be sure to plan your route first before you start the hike, and look out for the signs which tell you which direction to go as there are multiple trails you can pick from. We ended up losing our way initially as we missed the sign, but we made it back to the entrance at about 3pm and began the hike up to Baegundae Peak, which is the highest summit at Bukhansan National Park. Good shoes, a lot of water and small snacks are a must as this climb is an arduous one! Definitely not for young children. Towards the top, we had to use the cables to pull ourselves up as there were no more steps. Just be mentally and physically prepared for the hike. The view is definitely worth the climb as you can see layers and layers of mountains on the horizon on one side and the city on the other. When we got to the peak, it was almost 6pm and there weren't many people. We took about 3 hours to get up."
Views!,Gorgeous views of Seoul and surrounding countryside. Also a really interesting hike featuring some historic Korean buildings. 
Very nice mountain,"The park is easily accessible by metro and bus from Seoul and is a great day trip. There are several treks which you can undertake, for all levels of fitness. Obviously we went for the most challenging: Baegundae Peak - which is the highest peak. I understand that some people might find it difficult, there are some parts which are really challenging, but to be honest it's not so bad. The views from the top are excellent and we enjoyed a good Kimbap lunch (which we bought from the station). The descent can cause a few problems due to the many steps which can cause stress on the knees - a walking stick is recommended. Entrance was free which is always a good thing :)"
Worth the hike,This mountain offers stunning views of the city and an example of Korea's beautiful nature. It's easily accessible by subway and offers a half day's worth of hiking or more.
Great hike and views,"The main peak trail is harder to get to. Takes a while by bus. The peak on the north west is reachable by train. But to get an early start, my friend drove there by car. Trail very well maintained, but not much English signage. Hope u don't go the wrong way. It gets steep and rock after the first half. But at 700m of elevation gain can be peaked in 2-3 hrs. The air was very hazy when I was there so can't see much of the city."
