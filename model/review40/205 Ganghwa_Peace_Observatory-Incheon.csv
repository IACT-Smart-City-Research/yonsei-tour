Daytrip,"We went as part of a tour with korridor, as DMZ got cancelled due to African swine virus. It a look. Out point over to NK, very sad and touching. There is a short video and a little room with pictures, along with a peacetree."
Peaceful and Unique,"The view from the observatory is amazing. Except the fact that I could see a part of North Korea's land, there are many reasons why I recommend the place. Fresh air, beautiful sunset view, and unique atmosphere. A guide there told visitors and tourists lots of stories. If you have a plan to visit the island of Ganghwa, it will be a great choice to add the place to your itinerary. "
"Gaze into North Korea, step back in time.","I visited here on a company team building weekend back in 2015. It was a truly surreal experience. To get a first hand view across the Han River right into North Korea was looking into a world trapped in a time warp. It made me appreciate just what we have in our convenient everyday lives when you see farmers still using bullocks and bison to drag things around through barren farm land. Watching the people ride the bikes, wearing old style poor clothes and working the fields was ....as I said ....surreal."
North Korea in front of you,"DMZ is a well-known place for domestic and even foreign travellers. If you want to see directly the land of North Korea, not just see soldiers between the zone, this observatory would satisfy your desire. Tip : There is a parking lot so you can drive there but after parking your car, you have to walk to the ticket booth about 5 minutes. The path is a little bit steep so you had better wear comfortable shoes. "
See North Korea Like Never Before,"The peace observatory was part of our one-day trip to the Ganghwa island clusters. We visited the Bomunsa temple in Seokmodo before this and spent quite some time at the temple so ended up reaching the peace observatory at around 5.30pm thinking we had time because Google showed opening hours to be till 8pm but it was actually 6pm so we were unable to go up to the observatory point. Nevertheless, it was still quite a sight to see N. Korea just across the sea when all we saw of it before was from what we read. Cons: really quite inaccessible if you don't have a car. For a few reasons - public transport there is infrequent and there is a stiff climb up a steep hill to get to the info counter. Getting there via public transport: from oepo-ri dock, we took a public bus from the area where the bus from Ganghwa bus terminal drops passengers off for oepo-ri dock. There are no distinct signs to indicate where the bus stop is exactly at. Getting back: buses are really infrequent and we were unable to find information about the buses so we used google maps to find out buses that would bring us back. Do not depend on Google maps though as it does not reflect the timings and availability of the buses accurately. We waited for at least half an hour before a bus came by. The wait was rather experiential as N. Korea can be seen from the bus stop. So as you're waiting for the bus, you can take in the sights of N.Korea in front of your eyes and listen to the korean broadcasts at the same time. Tips: It'll be good if you're going with someone who can read and speak basic korean to communicate with the driver and confirm your destination. Alternatively, write down the Korean translations to show the locals. Definitely an off-the-beaten path destination for the adventurous!"
Excellent alternate way to view North Korea,"For those with their own transport, this is a great North Korea observatory option. Plentiful coin-operated binoculars, large viewing platforms, and ample parking. The place was virtually empty on a gorgeous spring Saturday, late in the day. We could see homes, farmers, and other daily activities just 2.3 km across the river. I'm sure much of what we saw is staged, but that's part of the experience. The observatory is on the northern tip of Ganghwa-do, and it can be combined with a day trip to see other sites on the island. The one downside -- the little museum is entirely in Korean. "
Incredible,It is amazing to see this place. The quality of the presentation is very high the meaning of the view is extreme.
