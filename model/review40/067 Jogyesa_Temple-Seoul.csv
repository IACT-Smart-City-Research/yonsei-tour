Not so much for tourists as religious devotees,"A beautiful temple, but definitely a working temple. Worth a walk around (its free), but work your way around the worshippers."
An ok visit for a temple in Seoul,"We signed up for a Seoul city/temple tour. We were picked up from our hotel in a medium sized shuttle bus and taken to this temple, to meet the rest of the group (then went to other locations in a big bus). The tour guide gave some explanations of this temple and gave us 20 minutes to look around, take pics.Part of the temple was roped off. We saw a lot of people inside, and also many people kneeling outside in a roped off area, praying and paying tribute. There are three golden color buddha statues inside. It is a relatively small temple/site, therefore an easy place to meet."
"Quiet in a busy city, beautiful.","I visited Jogyesa Temple on a Sunday afternoon. The temple is small. It is on a corner of center of busy city. However, once inside the temple it became quiet and tempo became slow. It was time that mum bloomed. The flowers and plants were fully and creatively integrated into many many objects in the temple - trees, statues, characters and bonsai's. The main build is quiet and peaceful. You can enter it after taking off shoes. This is a temple that is unique. I recommend visiting it if you have time."
Chrysanthemums,This large and important temple holding three golden buddhas is located in central Seoul so it is easy to get to. Although it is surrounded by high rise office buildings it still manages to retain a sense of calmness.When we were there in late October we were lucky to find that the Chrysanthemum Festival was in progress and the whole of the area outside the temple was occupied by statues and sculpures made out of thousands of the flower in a myriad of colours. It really was spectacular and a photographers dream. If you can I'd suggest you time your own visit to co-ordinate with it.
Beautiful place,"Really beautifully Tempel with lot of flower work in the courtyard. Impressing contrast of old temples with modern high rise buildings in the surrounding.Not much time needed here, but worth a stop for 15 to 20 minutes "
Beautiful temple in a city street location,The decoration both inside and outside Jogyesa Temple is beautiful and if you are lucky enough to visit when a service is being conducted you really get to experience the real atmosphere.
a nice relaxing place,"I went there when there was a flower festival. It's nice and quiet in a busy town. The temple is impressive - worth to gather your thoughts for a min, "
very interesting,We visited with a guide and so were able to learn about the temple and its history. There were people worshiping at the time so it was also interesting to see that.
Nice Temple in Heart of Seoul,"This is a working temple. Locals use it for daily prayers and the interior to the main building is reserved for worshipers. However, it is open to see inside and take pictures. Interesting architecture and murals on the outside of the buildings are beautiful. Worth a visit."
"Pretty, and different","This complex is structured quite differently from others that I'd been to - the grounds feel very open and rather haphazardly laid out. It's right in the middle of block after block of office buildings; you might think you were looking in the wrong location as you're headed towards it. The main temple building is definitely worth a visit - that's where you'll really get a sense of the vastness and serenity you might normally associate with the more traditional temples.As temples go, I think it's worth a visit because it's so different, but not necessarily a must-see if you're crunched for time."
Visit during chrysanthemum festival,Temple is absolutely beautiful. We visited during the chrysanthemum festival so it was full of flowers. We were made to feel very welcome. Definitely worth visiting in the evening to see temple lit up.
Beautiful Buddhist temple focused on Academic wishes,"This temple is very beautiful, easy to reach and fits as a small visit in between major nearby attractions.It is said people with wishes for academic achievement go to pray at this temple."
Festival,We attended the Chrysanthemum Festival recently. The setting was beautiful with well tendered manicured gardens. Monks were chanting inside the temple and the atmosphere was joyful and serene. We were offered free water and red bean cakes which just highlighted the warmth from the people. We lit incense and meditated at the shrine. 
Excellent,This temple was very beautiful with many forms of Buddha. The garden with all the lotus flowers was also very beautiful .It felt really good to be there in the temple . It is a very peaceful place and you can feel it in your heart.
Lovely temple in the heart of city,We enjoyed seeing this huge architectural temple.Outside the temple the area is developed with varieties of trees and flowers and buddha stupa with his disciples.I enjoyed this place spiritually and environmentally with good clean natural environment.Must visit this holy place even if you are non buddhist
Sthis is budist temple,"Great area to explore, has two 500 plus years trees, lovely place to go, with a diferent type of budismo "
Lovely temple in the middle of the city,"The temple was full of people at prayer.I enjoyed seeing a busy temple rather than an empty building. As a nonbuddhist,I found it a very interesting visit."
A peaceful retreat tucked among the hustle & bustle of Seoul ⛩ ,"Jogyesa temple is beautiful temple situated in the middle of Seoul. A colorful and peaceful temple with beautiful structures, ornaments and greenery to take anyone’s stress away for a little while. If you are in the area, swing by to enjoy this little piece of serenity. There is no admission to enter and there are plenty of places to relax and take in the sights. This is an active temple as well, so it amazing to participate in or just watch a service. "
Birthday trip,Jogyesa Temple was one of our first stops on the first full day tour in Seoul. The lotus garden/the pagoda tree and baby Budda were the highlights for me. Our guide Kasey was very accommodating/ and patient while each member of my family made their private wishes while rubbing the famous Pagoda tree n taking pics. It was surprising to find this temple so close to the big city not to mention to lotus garden. This temple was the precursor to our other temple visits. Because of the size and time of day we only need 30 minutes to tour and hear the history of this temple. Definitely put it on your list if you are in the area. 
Stunning temple - the highlight of our trip ,The temple was absolutely stunning. We visited it during the afternoon and then again in the evening to see the lights lit up. It took our breath away and the photos really can’t do it justice! 
Large Buddhist Temple,Jogye-sa is a very important buddist temple in Korea. It is the largest buddhist temple in Seoul. A very active temple there was a ceremony taking place when we visited and the ritualistic chanting was very atmospheric. Classic Korean architecture combined with Buddhist detail.
Nice peaceful temple,The temple is easy to visit if you are touring around Seoul. They apparently offer instruction to newcomers to Buddhism - a monk was giving a powerpoint lecture the faithful in the main temple. ;-) 
The most important temple for Koreans.,"An ancient temple in the old part of Seoul, in Jongno. According to the Koreans, for them it is as important as the Vatican for Christians. Many locals."
Beautiful serene place,I have been to many temples but this one was different with all the multicoloured balls seemingly floating in the air. The temple itself is an active one and there is not this feeling of a place set up for tourist but rather a genuine place of worship. People were friendly and tolerant of us.
Atmospheric,Came here by accident as I was following my map back to my hotel. The smell of incense and the beautiful buildings made this chance discovery one of the highlights of my stay in Seoul. 
Truly beautiful ,Just wow. You must visit. It’s so gorgeous and peaceful. Small so you don’t need long there but the colours are divine.
Moving,I am a Christian but I could not help visiting this wonderful Temple. Buddhists are very friendly people. Everyone should explore culture and visit this Temple.
Important temple,"The temple is very important for Korea, and has a long, and complicated, history in Seoul. Active and interesting. "
So beautiful!,"I wanted to see the golden Buddhas. When I got there, there was a service going on, so I didn't go in. Nice to experience the service. I sat on the benches toward the back fence. The lanterns in the tree and entrance were lovely. I loved all the lotus flowers and architecture too. Definitely glad I made the time to do this!"
Very interesting,We went to the Jogyesa Temple and were glad we visited. The lotus flowers all over were lovely and the entire temple area was very colorful. It was interesting to see the active worship going on.
One of the Most Beautiful Temples I've Ever Seen,"This is a quite unbelievable shrine, as nice as any I have seen in my travels through Japan and Korea. It defies belief that it is not better known I certainly have never seen anything quite like it.Beautifully lit at night, gorgeous colours. The Golden Buddha statues are just magnificent. Loved the lights in the trees and the heart shaped corridor you enter through.Beautiful smell of insence in the air and the most beautiful atmosphere of serenity. I discovered this place on my second night and will come back each evening now to enjoy its splendour.Quite, quite magnificent 5 stars doesn't seem enough to give."
"Beautiful, but confusing without a guide","We visited on a Monday, when the museum is closed. The temple is worth seeing, and it's in central Seoul near the main palace and the US Embassy. But without a guide, it was hard to understand what was what between the different buildings. It was hard to find a pamphlet in English (though there is a pavilion we eventually found that had a little brochure in English). Beautiful temple, but it was not the highlight of our visit because we didn't learn as much as other places we went."
beautiful temple,"Easy to find and get to. The temple was beautiful, some smaller temples were under construction though. The monks were really nice, and there were many people who prayed when i was there.Many tourists were also there and unfortunately did not follow the rules while inside the temple."
Very UNIQUE Temple!,"I haven't seen a temple quite like this one before. The multi-colored lanterns strung up in the skyline are mesmerizing. You'll find yourself staring up there, unable to stop yourself. The temples are beautifully painted and decorated. A must-see in the Insadong area. However, be respectful. We went on a Sunday morning and it was filled with local worshipers. Please treat their beliefs and ceremonies with respect and do not try to pose in front of their statues as they're trying to pray (which we saw on more than one occasion in our brief time there) Also, refrain from entering the main temple as a ceremony is going on. It's allowed, but how would you feel if someone entered your church in the middle of worship, loudly, and began taking pictures everywhere?"
Beautiful Buddhist temple,"A lovely, serene temple in the midst of Seoul with three giant Buddha statues inside and a 10-story stupa in which is enshined a relic of Buddha which was transported to Korean in 1913 by a Sri Lankan monk."
History in the middle of town!,This temple is located right inbetween officebuildings and daily life - it has 3 majestic buddhas to see and you can catch a ceremony if you are lucky! So go for it.
Interesting old temple setting amongst modernity ,Must see part of any Seoul tour surrounded by modern tall buildings. A relatively small temple compared to other major temples in Asian cities but still in a nice setting with a peaceful and reflective atmosphere. 
Well worth the visit,The Buddhist temple was amazing! It's incredible how well the grounds were kept and we even got to see the monks conducting a service. 
Taking you back to the Joseon Era,Great tourist attraction taking you back to the Joseon Era! Lovely place to take great photos and to learn about their history.
Stunning,"Preparing for Buddha birthday celebrations meant that the temple was covered in coloured lanterns and there were ladies pracising their dance in costume, absolutely stunning!"
Wow,"I didn’t know what to expect when my friend took me here, it’s beautiful and colourful. I arrived when a service was happening which was really interesting to watch and listen to."
Respite from the Heat,Lovely and relaxing place to visit. Saw a lot of office workers taking a break at the temple grounds and having cold brew and popcicles. Buddha's birthday has just passed but the colorful lanterns were still hanging. Interesting gift shop to visit and bough incense sticks.
Best go around Buddha's birthday,"The main hall looks very nice, both inside and outside. The whole temple was decorated because of Buddha's birthday so it looked great."
Beautiful temple in the middle of the city,"Jogyesa Temple is definitely worth a visit if you find yourself in the area. I don't think I'd go out of my way to visit, but then I have seen a lot of temples in Asia in the past. I suggest leaving your shoes at the door and going inside to experience the tranquility and ambience. For Buddhists this would be a must-visit. The three Buddhas are quite stunning. No photography inside is allowed."
Colorful,"There were numerous lanterns handing with papers from them. It is a small temple grounds but still has much to offer. They still had prayer areas, theater, shop, cafeteria, and a few other things. Like many other reviewers, I have been to larger temples but do not compare temples due to size. The colors on the temple make it more than worth the trip. Despite its size, it is one of the most important temples in Korea for Buddhism."
Serene and beautiful...see my note on how to enjoy Seoul. ,"Fortunately we were here early May when they celebrated the Buddha’s birthday. Lighted lanterns strung all over the street and at the temple. Three Buddha’s each having a different function. There is no organized tour as far as I could tell. The first ever post office in Korea is also located on the same grounds. Tip: If you want to really get a lot out of touring South Korea hire a private tour guide from VIP Travel (Susan). We had the concierge from the hotel organize or for us. Car and guide 500k Won plus fees. We really developed an understanding for their culture this way and saw a lot with the car whisking us around town. No more than 6 hours is my suggestion. She also took us to a local place for lunch. Again, a cultural experience. "
Spiritually important,It was worthwhile visiting to see this important temple and our visit was enhanced by the various displays of lanterns and offerings for Buddha’s birthday. But it was more moving still to see the many faithful showing personal devotion in their prayers 
Spectacular,Worth a visit. The restoration is amazing. Understanding these ancient buildings is difficult for westerners. Beautifully maintained and the new museum is woth the entry alone. Lot of kids on excursions but they a respectful and keep out of the way.
Go here around Buddha's birthday!,"It's a pretty small temple, not much to explore, but it's so worth the visit. Inside the main temple building you can see 3 big golden statues of Buddha (pay attention on where you should take off your shoes). Yet, it's most worth visit on around the end of April, during May, and beginning of June (around the date of Buddha's birthday), since they decorated the whole temple with the most festive looking lanterns! Guaranteed to take the most mesmerizing pictures!"
Paradise in the Centre of Seoul,"On our trip around South Korea with my husband we visited many temples and so we almost didn't visit this one- but I am so glad we did.On our last night we walked around the area and found ourselves so close we thought we should pop in. It is beautiful. An incredibly tranquil, peaceful place in the heart of Seoul. We visited quite late at night & would highly recommend.(sorry- we visited the year before but I really wanted to let everyone know that it is worth a visit for sure!)"
Temple Stay - daily stay only,"Great time viewing the temple rooms, making crafts, traditional Korean soy flour cookies and sharing tea/experiences with one of the nuns. "
Quiet place in a middle of noisy city.,"Easy to find Buddhist temple. Piece of quiet on busy world. Friendly monks. If you are there during the working day is quiet but when monks are meditating start to be quiet crowded. Nice and colourful. Monks are offering to stay with them for one day, but this need to be booked separately in advance by the temple website. Web is also available in English. Nice place to visit also with young children."
Beautiful place,The Jogysea Temple is a very beautiful and peaceful place. If you are in the area take the time to visit here. 
Stunning Buddha temple,I lucked out because we visited this temple just as it was being prepared for Buddha's anniversary and the temple and surroundings were being prepared for ceremonial duty.The interior of the temple is simply stunning with three magnificent Buddhas taking all of one wall and the remaining three walls liberally decorated. It is a working temple and most of the floor is covered in people in prayer and one is required to leave one's shoes outside. Beware of the shoe thief!
Peace in mind,Got by chance to visit Temple art shop where to decorate lotus flowers. the place is nicely peaceful and free tea time. 
Mesmorizing and informative,"We loved this temple. It happened to be a great time to visit during Buddha birthday celebration, they have a tour and it is just an overall peaceful place. "
Among buildings!,"We have mixed feelings after visiting this temple. is beautiful, in a typically Korean style, kept in a modest style, but ... she does not fit there! around huge skyscrapers, busy city and the sound of this modern Korea! There is a lack of peace and quiet to appreciate this place"
Calm and Beautiful,"Jogyesa is a beautiful temple with impressive Buddha statues. The decorations in the temple are intricate and the courtyard is beautifully lighted up. We landed up in the evening when there was a prayer service going on and we witnessed the local people performing their prayers. The chants accompanied by the drums have a calming effect. The temple is right next to Insadong, the best place for souvenir shopping in Seoul."
Easy to find ,"If you find yourself in downtown Seoul and want to see a Buddhist temple, this one is your obvious, maybe only, choice. In my opinion you can find much nicer temples in the Korean countryside, but for those with only time in Seoul this is the temple you will find most easily. I like the concrete Buddha statue next to the main building the most. "
Head temple of Korean Buddhism,"Considered as the most important temple of Korean Buddhism, this temple hosts many religious ceremonies, rituals all over the year including the Lantern festival. There is a huge praying hall, where anyone can pray, and one can see lot of local population visiting and praying. The temple complex also has a small garden.This temple is right in the heart of the city and can be clubbed with visit to Buckchon Hanok Village or G Palace."
Okay,We went there in the morning.is a small temple we were there about 20mins.good for photos.and a message on paper and hang them up on part of the tenple for luck and make a donation.not like the tenples in thailand but ok. 
Beautiful temple,It's a very serene temple with amazing interiors. There was a large prayer going on when we went there. The giant Buddha statues inside leave one with pure awe. The grounds of the temple were very well decorated. 
"Nice to visit, close to other attractions",Enjoyed our visit to this temple and was also close to Insa Dong and Gyeongbokgung Palace. Free to enter and look around. Recommended time 30 minutes. 
Seoul trip,"Visited when I did a trip around Seoul, there is many things to see in Seoul but I wanted to visit a temple and this was worth seeing"
Korean Buddhist,"come with our friends before flying out the country to try out new working experience . it is must do / it is very nice and beautiful Budha , the garden is amazing and the temple have very well setting and great design with High Architecture"
Spectacular Architecture and Tranquil Setting,"For first time visitor if u wanna have a glimpse of the Buddhist religion for the South Koreans, this temple is a highly recommended venue to visit. A very sacred place with locals saying prayers in their offerings to the golden buddha statues. A thumbs up!"
Quiet in the middle of the city,"We happened to find this little gem on our walk around town. The first thing that hit us was the overwhelming smell of flowers. The area is covered in small pots of flowers donated by people. Surprisingly it was very quiet considering how close to the streets it was. When services are going on, do not enter the main temple without removing your shoes and avoid snapping photos during this time out of respect. "
Buddhist en-light-enment,Visit at night to see the gardens lit up and lanterns on display - a magical wonderland! Only needs 1/2 hour tops so check out on the way to / from shopping and dining in Insadong.
good companion attraction to Insadong,went late October as a side trip before visiting Insadong on a Sunday afternoon. the temple is a short distance from Anguk Station and Insadong with no entrance fees. this was a very worthwhile 1 hour stroll among the dazzling mum displays around the clean manicured grounds. the flowers were in full bloom and the temple structures are equally colorful. the visitors were quiet and respectful of this peaceful environment. this is a good attraction if you are in the Insadong area.
Beautiful flowers and a respectful temple,"Visited the temple during prayer so didn't go inside out of respect, but the gardens around the outside are beautiful. The flowers had such a lovely smell, and the buildings are traditional and oozing history. "
Awesome view,It was a first sight in my tour! I wa imressed by the beauty of a view and flowers around. Very splenfud view. Budda is a super hero in South Korea. It is prohibited to make picture inside the temple. The statues of Budda are huge and beautiful. I would recommend this temple to my friends. Must see!
A unique spot in the middle of Seoul,"For someone not in the faith the temple represents, it was a curiosity. But, if you go, please be mindful that people are actively praying all around you, not just inside/in-front-of the main temple. It is a colorful and joyful place. At first, some of the figures in the garden made me feel like a child. I expected to run into Hello Kitty or somewhere. I didn't read up in advance about it so I missed appreciating in the moment what it all meant. Regardless, it is interesting both from a cultural standpoint for a non-believer visitor, and though from another faith, I certainly appreciated that this place is very special to many. Check it out for sure. Dress appropriately."
Annual Flower Festival!,We were lucky enough to be here for the annual flower festival and it was amazing. (late October). This can be a quick stop visit if you need filler in your schedule. Worth seeing!
Blooming Flowers,Temple with big golden Buddha statue. But the best part of this temple are the flowers! The colourful flowers are beautifully arranged around the temple. 
Jogyesa,"A nice pagoda near Anguk station. I think you should come there at least once time. The pagoda is smaller than Bongeungsa . From this, you can go to many place around."
Blooming flowers,"Yes that's what hit me first, the abundance of colour. Beautiful flowers outside the teample that were so delightful and welcoming."
Stunning flowers,"We came across this by chance when visiting Insadong Street (also well worth a visit!) and were charmed by the lush display of flowers surrounding many Buddhas at the temple. Very busy, but a calm and peaceful atmosphere."
Very impressive experience...,"We discovered the temple by chance, but, by all means, try to go there if you are close. Situated in the city center, easy to reach."
Worth a visit to see the Buddhas,We fit a visit in to see this after visiting the Bukchon Hanok Village nearby. The floral arrangements and sculpted hedges of elephants and dragons were unexpected. Seeing all the worshippers praying to three massive Buddhas is awe inspiring.
Beautiful temple,Walking distance from City Hall if you are okay to take a slow stroll. On the way you will see a lot of shops selling ornaments and the place was really beautifully decorated.
The headquarters of Jogye Order,"The Jogye Order is the biggest Buddishm sect of South Korea. And this place is their headquarters, located in central Seoul.The palace itself is not very big. But it would be nice to take a visit and see how locals pray and pay respect at this place. Take a visit when strolling around Insadong."
Jogyesa,Beautiful and vibrant temple.2 stalls in the temple that sells very simple local delights too. Good to visit if you need a peaceful and yet centralised place
Beautiful peaceful place to visit.,"The Jogyesa Temple is must a visit when is Seoul. The temple with a great history, with gardens and the number small buddhas arranged within the plant life Go first to see the main atrraction of the three large gold buddhas. Allow enough time to soak in the atmosphere and feel the vibration of the Temple and Buddhas .This is a busy temple, so is a great place to observe people and appreciate some wonderul Korean temple architechture at the same time."
good,"This is a nice temple in seoul i loved visit tempels, every temple is special in it's own way. this one you should do if you are in insadong"
popular temple but as good as many others,This is a large temple and has beautiful Buddhist statues inside but not as nice as many other temples in Korea. It is worth visiting simply because it is so close to other sights in the area (including Korea's first post office next door).
"A real delight to visit, and pray if desired.","We just loved the ambience and appearance of this lovely temple and surroundings. Meticulously maintained and obviously lovingly attended to, this temple was a delight to explore. Colour abounds with flowers, and sculptured tree decorations. Wonderful Buddha statues to see. This is an active temple for Followers to pray, and a great place to visit and enjoy."
Very nice temple,It’s in the heart of Seoul. Very easy to get around. Grounds are well maintained and grounds are lovely. Typical Buddha tree. Active temple so please show respect. Lovely golden Buddha s inside.
Buddha temple in the city ,"Very beautiful temple , not far from gyeongbokgung station! Highly recommend it for visiting !!! I love Korean style about mix high tech and old school building in architecture !"
"Fascinating temple, full of life","The Jogyesa Temple is definitely worth a look in if you are nearby. It's a fully functioning temple with a great history, with a number of differnt components to explore. Start with the grounds, admiring the gardens and the number small buddhas arranged within the plant life. Then head to the back of the complex to appreciate some of the older parts of the temple before heading to the main atrraction of the three large gold buddhas. This is a busy temple, so is a great place to observe people and appreciate some wonderul Korean temple architechture at the same time."
A must in Seoul,"I was really amazed by this place. It was my first time seeing such huge buddha statues, it was very imposing and majestic. We enjoyed it so much that we went two times during our trip. The first time we arrived at an hour which was filled with people in the terrace, on their knees, praying, hearing the monk speak over the microphone. Watching them being so devote and praying and ... it was just an amazing thing to see. The second time we went it was emptier, but still some people praying inside. We stayed outside - for respect- and had time to meditate and to take it all in. A must. "
Nothing special,Having been to temples all around Asia I don’t find this special. It’s nothing to write home about and worth skipping if you have other things on your list of must see’s and do’s. It was crowded inside of praying people so I felt a bit that I was disturbing. 
Must do when in Insadong,"This was a little break from shopping in Insadong, nice Temple with a path constructed from lotus plants in large pots when we were there. Didnt go in as people were using the temple for what it was designed for, and didnt want to impose. Looked in through windows and impressed by the statues. Like how old and new can live side by side in Seoul."
Take a break and enjoy the moment in town,"I always pass by and take a walk around the temple when I visit to Seoul combine with walking through Insadong. Beautiful Buddhist temple in the middle of city center with trees and flowers, this time exhibition of lotus flowers in the square. Take a break and enjoy. "
Must visit,"You will never imagine how a modern city and history got together in this city, you can walk anywhere, you feel safe and peace in Seoul."
a traditional temple in the middle of modern buildings,The serenity place for the travelers that would like to see the traditional temple and travelers may join the monk's activities if travelers are willing to. 
"A temple, nice but nothing much to do","Part of a group tour. A quite typical temple. nice lotus flowers. We visited this place in a very hot day. With kids. I would say, not for kids."
Amazing place ,It is not so big but is really cool to be there. I went at the ceremony time and it was really cool to see. I recommend it 
Well worth seeking out this temple,This temple is just siting on a main road close to the palaces. Full of people making devotional offerings and some eye catching decorations. 
Worth the visist,Instagram worthy as there are so many great visuals here if the temple is not interesting to you. We loved it all and stayed for an hour when it is about 5-10 min type of visit 
Peaceful and colorful,"It is a small, but an important temple for the believers and for the tourists to experience the atmosphere"
Must-visit temple in Insadong,"This was a breath of fresh air in the touristy district of Insadong. Stepping into the grounds, you are greeted by a profusion of lotus flowers. We were there during prayer time, so we did not go inside the main temple but stood outside, looking in and touring the grounds. Wish we could have seen the Buddhas up close. This is a pretty peaceful, refreshing spot in the middle of a busy city.There are a lot of pictorial opportunities here - from the statues to the flowers to the temple architecture and colorful grounds. Would love to see this place during the Lantern Festival. What a beautiful place!"
Lovely Temple In Insadong,Very close to the main shopping and restaurants area of Insadong. I visited during the spring of 2014 and enjoyed it. It's also along the way to Cheonggyecheon Stream so perfect to plan all three spots in one day and walk from one to the other.
Nice temple in the middle of Insadong,"This temple is in the middle of Insadong. It's easy to find and small in terms of the grounds. We found it on the way from Gyeongbukgong Palace to Insadong shopping area. There are good photo ops and you can pray there, but that's about it."
Great experience,"Beautiful place to visit just off a busy street. They had a table set up for foreign visitors to get information. While I did not participate, they do offer a temple stay program. Spent a few hours here listening to a service that was going on. The place is a constant buzz of activity."
Buddha's Birthday Decorations,We visited in mid-April and the courtyard was already being decorated with colored lanterns for Buddha's birthday in May. We walked around taking pictures and were able to catch a glimpse of the magnificent golden statues inside the temple. It was beautiful!
Good,"when we visited prayers were going on, it seems some renovation is going on too. it is not a huge temple but still loved it. very beautiful "
Beautiful Temple,"also very peaceful considering it is in the middle of the city. I walked here and the surroundings were beautiful. A lot of nature in the midst of a busy city like Seoul. Also across the street is a church that serves a vegan meal buffet, Amazing in case you are around this area, go eat across the street"
Very Nice!,"Walking around the city and came across this temple. Went in and wow it was so nice! Beautiful courtyard, and statues. I would say go, take in the temple and a chance for nice pictures!"
Peaceful place in the mid of the loud city,"A Buddhist Temple just s stone's throw from a busy street. With lots of greenery and very nicely decorated buildings. Free entrance. Many people praying, taking photos inside the building not allowed."
Buddhist Temple,"Jogyesa temple is pretty place in summer. When we went inside there was lots of lotus flowers. In pound I find some gold fish. Then when we went closer there was temple. Inside the temple are three big, gold sculptures of Budda(I think so) and people. After the big temple there was another place were people were prouding. Of course in the firdt one also, but in the second one they were prouding aloud. I really liked this, but there isn’t anything awesome or unusual."
Not that great,"There are certainly better temples to see in Seoul. I thought it was interesting, but overall a waste of time to see."
Nice temple to visit in the city centre ,Jogyesa is not as beautiful as Bongeunsa or other temples we have seen in SK but it's perhaps the most accessible - a short walk from Insadong. There was scaffolding around the main building when we visited the first time but it was removed when we walked past at the end of the trip. An oasis of calm in the frenetic city. There is an impressive pagoda in the courtyard and the Buddha statues in the prayer hall are pretty stunning. Worth a visit if in the area. 
A mystic and peaceful place ,Even when it is restorations across the place it is a wonderful place to meet locals praying so you can get a reference how one of the main religions behave.
Gorgeous Buddhist Temple,My family and I were fortunate enough to visit the Jogyesa Temple while a Buddhist service was going on. Both the Temple and the service were beautiful and inspiring. One the most interesting things to do in Seoul and potentially the most spiritual (if you happen to catch it during a service).
"Colorful, soulful and beautiful!",Gorgeous buddhist temple in the heart of the city. The 3 buddha statues inside temple are totally worth seeing. Loved the energy of the place. Must visit when you are in seoul!
Beautifully colourful temple,The Buddhist temples here were all roofed with brightly coloured lanterns which made for quite a display. Each one was the mark of a family donation and wishes for the future and then there were some areas with plain white lanterns which were prayers for the dead. The buildings were brightly painted and the whole site was quite spectacular. Admission was free and photos were allowed as long as you didn't take them in the shrine itself. There was a bus stop just outside so the site is easy to get to.
Amazing Budhist Temple in Seoul,"Relaxing to visit, the chanting inside.Outside they were handing out free water bottles.Great atmosphere and decor with the lanterns."
Lovely venue closeby Insa-dong,"If you're in the Insa-dong area or visiting palaces, please make a stop by the Jogyesa Temple. Its a tranquil location, beautiful to wander in and there are guides/signages for foreign visitors to direct your visit. Of course as a temple / religious venue please dress appropriately (nothing too revealing), even if the locals do not scold you if you do not.It's a good escape from the hustle and bustle of the city but I would say you can also clear the place in 30 minutes or so. The temple stay information center across the road is additionally a great place to learn about Korean Buddhism and can be additional cultural exposure for those who wish to immerse into the religious side of South Korea."
So peaceful ,It’s beautiful temple I love to visit temple it’s feel so special and wonderful place to relax and see art you can spend hours here to walk around and see a lot of thing and rest if you want too ! Will come back to visit! 
Lovely sight to see in a bustling city!,Visit the Buddhist temple whilst watching the lantern festival of 2018. Don’t forget to take your shoes off before entering.
festival!,On end of May look like there is a festival all around the temples and gardenIt s stunning and so colorfulThe ambiance is unique
Stunning temple especially during the lantern festival,"The grounds of the temple aren’t terribly exciting accept for during the lantern festival. At this time it is absolutely beautiful, especially at night all lit up. The interior of the temple is impressive and opulent and definitely worth a visit. "
Buddhist temple,"Just over 1 week until Buddha’s birthday celebration. 100s of colorful lanterns. If you want to add your note on to a lantern, it will cost you 30,000krw. 500 year old tree in front of temple."
A serene place for worshipping Buddhist,This place is one of it kind situated within city of Seoul frequented by travellers from far away place just to pay respect and adherent devotion to their Buddhist religion. So calm and serene with beautiful century old architectural facade and have colossal life size Buddha. 
BUDDHA BLESS YOU!,I have always been amazed of the Buddha and the blessings it can bestow to people that prays and believes. We went there and the place is so crowded but you can still feel the serenity of the place.
Wonderful!,"Regardless of faith I think it's an amazing place to visit - I especially got captivated by the movements of paper tags (pardon if they're called something different) in the wind. It's a big temple, you would need to take your shoes off. There are a lot of people praying, so need to be quiet and careful walking around. Everybody was friendly and smiling. A must see in Seoul. "
A lovely little temple,"A lovely little temple, which fully demonstrates the peoples' reverence for Buddha. It was colourfully draped with lanterns during my visit that invited you to enter. interesting Icons of worship were around the two courtyards including folk deities. Unfortunately, there wasn't entry to the drum tower. I only saw one monk during my 45 min visit. It's close to Insa-dong so it's well worth a visit. It has an information room for questions and across the road, they organize temple stays."
Go there for good luck,"A Buddhist temple with many people going here to worship, flickering candles, paper lanterns, the gold Buddha's all add to the atmosphere."
Hot tip - walk across the road,"The Jogyesa temple is lovely, particularly with all the lanterns in preparation for Buddha’s birthday, but across the road is the templestay cultural program. You can walk in off the street and make a paper lotus lantern or have a tea ceremony with a monk for free! One of my fave Seoul experiences!"
Peace of mind!,Jogyesa temple was the only temple we visited in Seoul as it was close to our hotel. The temple was being prepared for the upcoming Buddha's birthday celebration with lot of colourful lanterns. There were lot of local worshippers inside the temple. Its worth a short visit.
Really colourful ,When we were there today they were only days away from the Buddha Birthday celebrations so the place was looking really good.Hundreds of lanterns and more being madeThe outside was beautifully decoratedRegrettably when there we couldn't see inside because it was packed with worshippers but then that's what it's there for
Peaceful place in the centre of bustle,A place of calm to allow a break from the bustle around.We enjoyed a calm hour in the middle of the day just walking around the temple surrounds.
The Representative Buddhist Temple in Seoul.,"This temple is the main one of the Buddhist Order, Jokye-Jong. Chosun Dynasty worshipped Confucianism and surpressed Buddhism whereas Shilla and Korea Dynasty worshipped Buddhism. There were rarely Buddhist temples in the center of capital city during Chosun Dynasty whereas there were many Buddhist temples in the center of capital city, Kyung-Joo and Kae-Sung during Shilla and Korea Dynasty."
Beautiful and colourful,We loved the small grounds of this temple. The colours were amazing and there was an extremely serene atmosphere here. Free to wonder around but some areas are restricted if services are happening.
Colorful Lampion ,"Its near the palace and tourists attractions you simply can notice by the bright lampion hanging across the street, its temple for budha religious so we need to respect them and not just consider this place as one of place for photogrid. they actually doing prayers and religious activities inside but its free and open for tourists "
A wonderful temple,The temple is colorfoul and silent in the center of a crowded metropole. A visit is worth it. But please respect the praying people and don't take pics from inside.
Calm Temple,Beautfiul buddha temple in SeoulLot of Decorations with lantern was madeMany people come to prayNice experience
beaeutiful little temple,"Beautiful temple in the middle of Seoul. We went in October when there was some type of flower festival and they had huge ""sculptures"" made of flowers. It was so colorful and impressive. I loved this spot!"
Calm your mind,"I love Korean temples in general but Jogyesa is really good about all year activities. They have lotus flower festival, Buddha birthday celebrations, English speaking staff and of course temple is amazingly pretty! It's so easy to find it and you don't have to climb any mountain to get there. Exactly in the middle of Seoul!"
Nice,"Visited as part of a half-day, multi-site tour. This was our first stop and it was honestly a bit underwhelming. You are not allowed to take pictures inside the temple as it is a place of worship. It was very cold in the morning and not much to see here. Maybe it would be time better spent during the warmer months."
Jogye Buddhist Sect Headquarters,"This temple is the headquarters of one of the major Buddhist sects in Korea. My experience with temples of this sect is they are highly commercialized. Not my favorite Buddhist sect. But a nice place to visit if you are in the Insadong area or staying in or near Gwanghwamun. There is a great hotel, Sommerset Palace, located just across the alley from the Temple. "
Interesting Temple in city centre (near Insa-dong),Jogyesa temple is an interesting place to visit as the colourful lanterns will make wonderful pictures. 
Unexpected Finding,"After exploring the palaces near our hotel, on our way back we saw this temple, located just along the street. At first we hesitated to enter, but it has a very inviting ambiance. The temple is huge, quite and relaxing despite of having a number worshipers on that day. The decorations on the ceiling are bright and colorful. It has sculptures in the area. This place is has free entrance fee and no dress code. We enjoyed touring around the temple and was fascinated with its decorations. It was indeed a great unexpected finding! One of the benefits of walking."
History in the heart of Seoul,This gem of Buddhist history is centrally located in Seoul and is close to many other attractions. The best time is to go just before or during Buddha's birthday when the temple is festooned with colorful lanterns.
Small temple in Seoul and not much to see,"I’ve been to various Buddhist temples in Asia, this one was very small and not much to see. The main hall for prayer is really the only building. There are 2 other buildings but not much. The store had bags of rice for an offering. Maybe it was the day of my visit but not much was happening. Done in less than 1 hour"
Good,Really Nice and relaxing. Close to the other big palaces. Free entry and no special dress code required.
HQ of one Korean buddhism. Less touristic.,"This is the headquarters of Jogyejong which is one branch of Korean Buddhism.The main hall is really big. But, other areas aren't much. Place for Buddhists rather than tourists.- The accessibility is quite nice unlike most other mountain-area temples of Korea. Walkable distance from metro line #5 Gwanghwamun and line #3 Anguk. Taking a look for about half an hour will be okay for tourists.- 4 guardians at the gate are made of steel and each one weighs 1 ton. Good to take a look.- There are huge trees, souvenir shops, the main hall, praying rooms, a museum, etc.- There's the first-ever post office of Korea locating nearby which is currently a museum.- Across the street, there's the temple stay office where visitors can get help."
Nirvana,"A nice experience with my son, an interesting arcitechture, history and religuous place. Interesting with all the People inside praying and study budism. I my reach the first grade of Nirvana :) it is Worth a visit :) "
Only for a quick stop,"Not particularly a Buddhist myself, I would not recommend any tourists going out of their way if only to visit this temple. As it isn't particularly unique compared to temples in China (and this one is quite small), you should only pass through this temple if you're coming through from Anguk station, through Insadong, the temple then perhaps making your way to Geonggbukgong temple.As it is a temple, you will need to be a bit more respectful. Eg: going into the main temple with 3 gold Buddha's, you will need to take off your shoes and maintain peace and quiet. I would not recommend taking photos here due to the nature of this place. Outside, where there is a pavilion/tower, if there is a Buddhist conducting prayer, they may be chanting whilst circling round the pagoda. It may be a good idea to ensure you're not in their way. Despite all that, if you're interested in writing out your prayer/wishes, visit the tourist information office near the gates where you may take one of the wishes card to write your wishes on. Right next to the gate, you will be able to hang your wish card and also take a postcard back home as souvenir.All in all, a quick visit that may not take you more than 30 minutes if you can navigate your way. (Recommend you downloading the Navermap app as it took us everywhere we wanted easily)"
Not much to see,"As someone who is by no means an expert in Buddhism, I wasn't too sure what the attraction of this temple was for tourists. Compared to many temples in China and Japan, I did not find it to be anywhere near as impressive or interesting. And compared to many Zen temples in Japan (Kyoto in particular) it did not seem to have a relaxing feel about it. It's very easy to access, so if you're in the area then maybe it's worth a visit, but I wouldn't recommend going out of your way to visit."
Jogyesa Temple in Autumn 2017,This temple’s design every autumn is very beautiful. It never fails to amaze me every year. This year the design was for autumn flowers in the shape of tulip. How was that? You don’t need to pay to enter Jogyesa. It accessible when you are already in Insadong - a place to find and buy traditional culture and crafts. Please enjoy the beautiful pictures. 
Flashy and fun,"If you are passing by, pop in - I wouldn't travel hours to see it.There is a nice vibe and no-one minds tourists being here."
Centrally located,"This temple is centrally located in the Insadong area. There is an attached store. If you have seen big temples in other countries, this will be a dissappointment."
Great Temple,This temple is rather large with very ornate details. From the temple itself to the surrounding gates. It is definitely worth the time taken to see it. The 3 Golden Buddha’s in the temple were magnificent. Additionally it has an English visitor center. Directly across the street from this neat temple is a cultural center. 
Beautiful Buddhist temple of Seoul,Its a beautiful temple with statues of golden Buddha inside. Atmosphere is very calm & serene. We visited it on 1st January so it was full with local people who had come to offer their prayers.  Devotees also burn incense outside .Beautiful Korean architecture can be seen here. View is awesome.
In the middle of Seoul,"Jogyesa Temple is close to Insadong, about 5 mins walking distance. The temple is not big. The garden of temple is the nicest part. There are trees and lots of flowers with various colors. You can see the high-rise building around the temple, which makes an interesting contrast.The temple itself is built with traditional Korean building / temple style. The ceiling and roof of the temple are painted with bright red and green color with a lot of flower design. You can find these designs in a lot of old temples and palace buildings. There are a few buddha statues inside the temple. People burn incense and worship there. You have to take off your shoes if you want to go into the temple and taking photo inside the temple is not allowed. We took a few pictures of the interior of temple from outside the temple and it was ok. There is a book store / souvenir shop and a washroom in the temple garden. We spent about 45 mins there then we strolled to Insadong. Along the street where the temple is, there are lots of stores selling temple wear for monks and nuns, restaurants for vegetarians. If you go to Insadong, you can spend an hour in the temple and the surround area to experience their religious atmosphere."
Jogyesa Temple with plenty of lanterns,I visited Jogyesa temple on 6th October 2017. This temple has 3 golden Buddhas seated in the main temple with lots of lanterns on the inside roof. The outside has beautiful flowers growing from the ground. The flowers scenery on the outside of the Jogyesa Temple is very pretty. 
Serenity in the Heart of Seoul,"Jogyesa Temple is one of the most important Buddhist temples in Korea and a symbol of Korean Buddhism. It is located in the heart of the city near Insadong. Since 1936, it has been the head temple of the first district of the Jogye Order of Korea Buddhism.The temple was first established in 1395, at the start of the Joseon Dynasty. The modern temple was established in 1910 and was originally located at a different location. At this time, the temple was known as Gakhwangsa.In 1937, it was moved to its current location where it was reconstructed. Construction was completed on October 25, 1938.At this time, the temple was known as Taegosa. This was during the Japanese occupation of Korea (1910-1945). The name stayed the same until 1954.After liberation, in 1954, the Buddhist Purification Movement was established. The goal of the movement was to eliminate any residual Japanese influence from their occupation. That same year, the temple was renamed to Jogyesa. This was a way for Korea to move on and forget the past horrors of the Japanese occupation.In late 1998, Jogyesa was occupied by monks taking part in a protest and power struggle between the Jogye Order organization. After 40 days, riot police were called in to expel the protesters. The story made international headlines.Today, Daeungjeon (Main Dharma Hall) is the largest temple building in the city of Seoul and on its own is a spectacular and colorful sight for any visitor.Visitors here will be surprised to find a beautiful setting and sense of calmness in the middle of the hectic and crowded city. The grounds are a great escape from the big city for both locals and tourists. Some of the nature that is not to be missed include a rare 500 year old Baeksong lacebark pine tree and a 450 year old Chinese scholar tree.Jogyesa Temple may not be the most beautiful or grand grounds in Korea, but its strength lies in its convenient location makes it one the most visited and popular temples in central Seoul."
Very beatiful,"Very beautiful temple. It is located walking distance from the Gyeongbokgung Palace, so one can walk there. Highly recommended."
Quiet and colorful ,"Jogyesa Temple is the center of Korean Buddhism and has a great history behind. Temple’s garden is pretty and colorful, which is decorated in accordance with the season, festival or event."
Peaceful retreat within the city,"After a long, busy, bustling day in Seoul, I happened to arrive at Jogyesa just before 18:00 and the monks soon began to drum and chant in the twilight. The beauty and serenity were quite powerful. It is hard not to notice the juxtaposition of this wonderful spiritual retreat in the heart of a vibrantly active urban location. Very much worth the visit."
Calming and spiritual visit,"Love to visit while I am staying in Seoul. A peaceful and respectful spot. Please see my previous review for exactly how to get to Jogyesa. Also tip for wheelchairs. No major exhibition going on this trip and no major flower presentation, but a calming and stress free stay. It is free to enter."
Peaceful temple,Came here to offer my prayers. I find the place really peaceful even though it is in the middle of the city. The decorations are also really pretty.
Full of chrysanthemums!,"They keep changing its decoration every season. Couple of years they were full of chrysanthemums in fall, so I took my friends this afternoon. Today, I found the main four heroes in the journey to the West(西遊記). They are surrounded by pretty chrysanthemums. Good to visit!"
"Accidentally Went to, but was Great","I saw colourful flowers, monkey king and Korean traditional roof, so jumped out of the bus without knowing what this place was. What a nice surprise! There were huge 3 golden budah, tower... small crowded place with many people praying for their children (heard about a National University Entrance Exam in few weeks). But I enjoyed colourful flowers, decorated cartoon characters, beautiful Korean traditional buildings. Very close to InSa-dong and Palaces in central Seoul. It is free."
Historic Temple,Jogyesa Temple is one of the most important Buddhist temples in Korea and a symbol of Korean Buddhism. It is centrally located near Insadong. It is an important temple because it is the lead temple of the first district of the Jogye Order of Korea Buddhism.The temple dates back to the time of the Joseon Dynasty in the late 14th century. It was located in another location and only came to the present location in the early 20th century and the building was completed in 1938 during the Japanese occupation. It was in 1954 that the temple officially became known as the Jogyesa Temple.Entrance is free. There is a dress code – and visitors are requested to respect the holy temple with appropriate wear.There is a flower garden that is pretty. The temple is beautifully designed.
A sacred experience,"Our daughter lives just south of Seoul and we visited her last summer. First I was in awe of the mandala of Lotus flowers. But as I stepped up to see the 3 gold Buddhas, I was speechless. I must have stood there for 30 minutes. My husband I went inside and chanted/prayed/meditated with those inside. I'll never forget this experience. I've seen many Buddhist temples in different countries, but this one so resonated with me. Such spirit it has. Visit the gift shop too for some wonderful items. I bought a CD of one of the Monks chanting the same chant we heard and I play it in my yoga classes. Everyone loves it."
Mesmerizing,Mesmerizing just to see the large Buddha statues. And even feeling more at peace while worship was ongoing.
Chryanthemum festival,"The temple itself was beautiful and gives you a glimpse of the religious of South Korea but during the Chrysanthemum festival, it looks even more beautiful. Tons and tons of different shades of chrysanthemums are made into different shapes and characters to create a beautiful display. There was so much to see and so many things to take pictures of. If youre planning to come to Korea in autumn, definitely dont miss this temple especially when the flowers are setup already"
Nice temple visit with lunch and tea ceremony with a monk,"Visited the temples during a chrysanthemum festival, so the grounds were beautifully decorated with colorful flowers. The grounds were a nice oasis in the middle of the city, but was not exactly peaceful due to the crowds. Our group scheduled time to speak with a monk for a tea ceremony and a short lesson on mediation which was nice. We also ate lunch across the street, served buffet style, which was the best vegetarian meal I have ever had. The meal was a diverse combination of flavors and used ingredients like black sesame pastes that I have never tasted in vegetarian meals. I was overall very impressed with the whole visit and would recommend it to anyone visiting Seoul."
Oasis in the city,This is a beautiful working and living temple complex very close to Insadong and absolutely a must-visit for anyone interested in Buddism. Not recommended for those expecting a themepark experience. This is a place for respectful quiet and somewhere to appreciate the still deeply held philosophical beliefs of many Koreans.
Beautiful Small Temple in the middle of concrete jungle,"I went in October where the entrance to the temple were filled with flowers. Flowers every where. I walked in smiling and left smiling. It's small compare to other temples. If you are expecting a huge temple in a crowded city, you are mistaken and go out the city where there are plenty large temples. If you are in Seoul for couple of days, visit this. Stop comparing to other temples. It's small b/c its in a middle of tall building in a small crowded city. But go and see this small beautiful place. "
Different from a normal Buddhist temple ,"Small temple with a difference. Plenty of flowers and lanterns, still rather peaceful. Bought some black sticky rice with brown powdery covering from the Korean lady - like a sweet and very tasty."
City respite,"If you get tired of the shopping at Insadong and palace sightseeing, this temple is a nice little respite to stop and have a rest. Spacious peaceful yard which we were welcome to sit in, perhaps you will be lucky to chance upon the prayers and chants. You can take photographs of the building and garden landscape but no photographs of the inside. One nice Korean lady invited us to go into the temple where the prayers are happening in what I assume to be the main hall so it must be okay to go in and sit respectfully, but best to double check if you really want to go in."
"Important temple, not just a calm in the busy streets","This is the central temple of the Jogye sect of Buddhism, the most important sect of the tradition in Korea. The tradition dates back over 1000 years, and connected with prominent places like Haeinsa Temple in the southern part of Korea. Jogyesa is relatively new, but has become important for Buddhism in modern Korea. It has been the site of political protests, and important religious work. Its a small place, so for the tourist looking to take a few pictures, you'll be done soon, but read up a bit on it and you'll appreciate it more, especially considering its central location."
Free temple,"This is a very unusual temple. It's sandwiched in between a lot of modern building, that has clearly encroached on the temple ground. In October 2017, the grounds had wonderful flowers and floral displays, but I don't know if that's always there. The temple 'decor' is a bit childish, which in itself is quite unique. You can visit two temples inside, but you must remove your shoes and no inside photography is allowed."
Small temple,Small temple. Much more people. 3 big buddha sculptures. Almost city center. You can go this temple after Gyeongbokgung Palace. 
Beautiful Buddhist temple,"Beautiful temple buildings, nicely painted decoration and plants. In October-November Chrysanthemun festival. In the area also a Memorial hall for the history and culture for Korean Buddhism"
Nice working buddhist temple,Excellent opportunity to see normal koreans praying and carrying out buddhist rituals in the center of the city
Ornate Buddhist Temple,Interesting cultural site nestled in Seoul. Within walking distance of Gyeonbokgung Palace area. Restaurants and vendors galore
Jogyesa Temple Review,Interesting architecture and ambience. Very colorful decoration inside and outside. I found here totally by chance and I am glad that I entered.
A great find in the middle of Seoul,"It was surprising to find such a temple in the middle of Seoul, it was set back from the road and not so easy to see at first, but well worth the effort. The temple was very busy at the weekend with worshippers, with only a few of us tourists! The place comprised of the temple itself plus what seemed to be a separate building for study on the ground floor (with the 2nd floor being inaccessible). Although not a lot to see, what is there is well worth the trip, and so convenient to reach. We visited the temple after visiting Gyeongbokgung Palace (within walking distance of this)."
Beautiful,Very picturesque! Architecture is quite impressive. This is an active temple where you can see monks and worshipers praying. 
A beautiful and peaceful temple in midst of city !!,This Buddhist temple is a must visit. Its situated right in the middle of city hustle bustle . The most striking feature for me was its magnificent lotus garden. Just fell in love at the first sight with these flowers. Past the garden u reach the temple gate where one can offer prayers and sit for a while. Adjacent to the temple is a small souvenir shop with beautiful collection of candles and bells.
Don't miss this!,I think this was the best part of my Seoul trip. I had the luck of visiting this temple after sunset and everything was beautifully lit and the area breathed serenity. This is a haven of tranquility in Seoul and it is the one place I'm certainly going to (re)visit next time (and I'm not even religious or a Buddhist!).
No.1 place in Seoul to visit if you are a Buddhist!,"A temple in the middle of the city, surrounded by all busy streets. As soon as you go inside, it is a different world with peace and calm enviornment. Magnifient building with beutiful flowers around the temple."
Hidden temple,"It is not easy to reach the temple, it is hidden, Follow the map and then ask the people. The vist is definitely worth the trip!"
Nice Buddhist temple,We had a great spiritual experience here. The monks and hundreds of local Buddhists read the praying in both Sanskrit and sometimes Korean. The red and green theme decoration on the wooden structure is beautiful. The lovely lotus pots in front are so nice and aromatic. I highly recommend this temple in Seoul.
A spiritual and moving experience,"Not only did I feel privileged to have been able to see this magnificent temple, I was also able to be inside and participate in a ceremony. I felt in awe of the warmth people offered us to be with them and to join them in prayer. We were offered cushions by many who welcomed us inside. This exquisite site should be in everyone's list of things to do in Seoul. We happened to be there for the celebration of Buddah's birthday and we're invited to join a large group of volunteers, all Korean locals, to design the paper lanterns to be used in the celebrations the following day. My friend and I were really moved by this amazing experience. So beautiful!"
Must see!,Smack dab in the bustling city of Seoul is this beautiful temple - the headquarters for all temples around Korea. Despite its location and the crowds there's this serenity... the lotus garden is absolutely gorgeous... i could have just spent hours just sitting there and watching the people come to pray and worship... 
Quite small and a bit boring,"I love visiting temples, and I took a trip to Japan earlier in the year visiting a lot of temples and shrines and fell in love with them - I was disappointed with the size of this temple and it is situated in not the nicest area. I would suggest visiting Gyeongbokgung palace and missing this out if you're rushed for time."
Hidden Gem,"This temple hidden in the city is a little tough to find. Once we got there we were mesmerized by all of the beautiful colors of the lanterns that create a canopy over the grounds. The Buddhas themselves are beautiful. In contrast to temples we had been to in Japan, there aren't too many tourists, and you can enjoy the sights without too many people around fighting for the perfect picture."
I love buddha,you need to visit here if you like statues or budhas. we went all over the grounds and loved the statues.
convenient,"Conveniently located in between Jonggak and Anguk station, just opposite the Templestay information centre. I'm sure this place is not unfamiliar to many. The main temple every year during Buddha Day events. There's a vegetarian food fair during Buddha Day period too. The famous vegetarian restaurant Balwoo Gongyang - 발우공양 is located in the Templestay information centre building too. "
Hidden Temple worth the find,I set out to find this temple while walking in Seoul. It is somewhat hidden and out of the way. It is not particularly large as compared to many temples in Thailand. I arrived during a prayer service which was very well attended. There is less economic activity on the grounds of the temple than what you would find in Thailand also. It is interesting and worth the walk but don't expect it to be the same as some other countries.
Breathtaking ,"Absolutely beautiful,soo colourful and rows of Lillie's in bloom ,stunning features ,and you can see the huge gold Buddah inside the magnificent temple ,great place for pics ,feels soo calming here within the sights of huge skyscrapers ,and just around the corner great shopping area ,selling anything and everything such a fab place to visit."
Amazing temple,"The grounds and inner temple are a must see. Beautiful, colorful and dynamic setting. I was offered a cup of warm lotus tea while there, a welcoming and devotional atmosphere. This is a working temple so be mindful and respectful of devotees on grounds. "
It was an okay place,"I fins this place alright. I saw many koreans praying at the 3 buddhas. There were some nice lanterns. But I think it is worth an hour, at most since there is nothign much to see. I think it's meant for worship rather than for tourists."
Visited and worshipped as well,A typical Chinese temple. I and my friends joined in a worshipping ceremony and experienced some peaceful moments.
It's just okay...,I have seen better. Maybe we went here at the temple's most bland days. There was nothing much to see. Didn't even see a single lantern..
Nice experience.,"I visited this Buddha temple and loved it. Never been to Buddha temple before, got inside and stayed about half an hour. Good experience !!"
Jogyesa Zen Temple: Landmark Temple located near Insadong's Main Shopping Street,"Jogyesa Temple, the bastion of Korean Zen Buddhism, is an important landmark in Seoul, attracting many visitors from all over the world. In late Spring every year, this temple is decorated with sea of beautiful lanterns. As the highlight of 3-day festival celebrating Buddha's birthday, impressive Lotus Lantern Parade unfolds along Jongno Street ending at Jogyesa Temple. If you visit the temple in late April, you will be immersed in the spectacle of thousands of beautiful lanterns floating in the air surrounding the temple. Since the temple is not far from Insadong's main shopping street, visitors can combine their visit to Insadong with visit to Jogyesa Temple."
Budhist temple in the center,A peacefull place near Insadong ... the golden Buddhas are impressive. Last year I was there during the festival for Budha's birthday and there were so many bright lanterns all aroung the temple. Nice templs restaurant on the other side of the street
Very special temple,My first visit to Jogyesa Temple in Seoul.You need to take a little walk to get to this temple if you are going by skytrain.A very special temple with lantern all over the place.There are alot of activities in the temple such as charity event and music performance for tourist as well.
Working temple,"An important Buddhist temple which attracts worshippers near and far, so you need to be respectful. Bright colourful exterior with 3 dominate status inside. In the heart of Insadong so easy to combine with our place to visit nearby.Thanks for the vote if you found this review helpful."
Ppl pray here,So be respectful! You can sit down and watch the 3 Buddha's and ppl praying. It's worth a visit for sure. It's a small temple. Free of costs 
Beautiful temple,Beautiful temple with the full range of Buddhist art. It is a little difficult to view the interior which is pretty crowded with worshippers but the courtyard is pleasant too.
"Beautiful, peaceful place to meditate or just sit and relax.","Jogyesa temple is open to everyone and a lovely place to meditate. You can enter the temple but remember to remove your shoes and respect the other people who are there to pray. It appears that it is better to wear socks so you aren't walking barefoot in the temple. Usually, there are Buddhists outside the temple as well (as least in warm weather). You should not take pictures inside the temple. There is are a restaurant and a number of Buddhist supply stores that are very interesting to experience. If you are there in May during Buddha's birthday celebrations, you will be treated to a beautiful lantern display."
Lovely Temple,"This is a relatively small temple all in all, with a central facility and a small group of outlying buildings. The main temple is beautiful, and was in full business when I was there, chanting and all.There's a nice entry gate from the main road, and a few shops catering to appropriately Buddhist stuff along there as well.This is a bit different from my experience with temples and shrines in Japan, with the Chinese influence much more pronounced.Worth a visit."
The Most Amazing Temple on the Korean Peninsula: 조계사 ^_^,"My girlfriend and I went to Jogyesa and wanted to try the temple stay at the best temple in Korea, but then decided not to due to time constraint, because we also went to Nami Island and other fun places in Taehan Minguk.Established back in 1395 during the Joseon dynasty, it changed its name back to Jogyesa Temple after the Japanese were defeated in World War II.Inside the main building, there are three Golden Buddhas, I assume made of pure gold because they are very shiny, and people were either prostrating, reading sutras, or just meditating on their mats.Surrounding the three Golden Buddhas, is the most famous Buddhist Sutra, originally in Chinese Characters, but now also available in Korean language: The Great Diamond Sutra, translated by Kumarajiva, an Indian who also know the Chinese language better than most Chinese Monks.We spent around 2 hours, and recited the Diamond Sutra in Chinese, including the ending Mantra, which is not commonly seen in the Mandarin version.Overall, the temple is amazing, and Buddhist Monks ring the bell and chant sutras that calm the mind every hour, and there is a nice store that sells many books and Buddhist itineraries, and I happily bought a copy of the Prajnaparamita Heart Sutra in Korean.Aje Aje Para Aje Para Sam Aje Boddhi Satvaha ^_^"
Peace center,A spacious place located in city center. Very calm and peaceful. Recommend to everyone visits Seoul who wants to have a mindfulness minute or a spiritual experience.
Lanterns are STILL up from Buddha's birthday! ,"I went on 5/28 and the lanterns were still up! Jogyesa is close to a lot of other cultural sites(insadong, gwanghwamun,bukchon) and you can fit it all in one trip. A must see if you want a closer look at a Buddhist temple in Seoul "
Jogyesa Temple,We happened to be in Seoul in May so the temple was adorned with colorful lanterns to celebrate the Buddha's birthday. It was beautiful and we were able to hear the monks chanting. Definitely worth a visit. Plus the nearby shopping area of Insa-dong is next too it so you can shop for souvenirs too!
Better than Nice,Worth the visit. You could include in your cramped itenerary --- short visit but rich experience. You could go here after your Gyeongbokgung Temple tour. Near Insadong also --- you could buy your souveneirs after your Jogyesa escapade. Also a few blocks away from Bukchon Hanok Village site. Nice place to take pictures.
Colorful Beacon in a Busy City,"We ran into this temple while venturing around the busy walking street of Insadong. Nestled right between the palace and the busy walkway, Jogyesa radiates with colorful lanterns, enormous Buddhas, and meditating locals. Despite its enormous size, Jogyesa is quiet - it's the perfect place to rest your feet or take a break from the busyness of Seoul."
Beautiful and tranquil. ,What a beautiful Buddhist temple. We were lucky to visit during the celebration of Buddha birth as the temple was covered in colorful lanterns. Remember to hug the 400 year old tree for good luck. 
A little site of quiet in the middle of the city,The area is small but a good one to walk around in quietly and meditate while looking at the temple structures around. I came when hundreds of colored lanterns were hung high up creating a colorful ceiling of light. I like stopping by this place when I'm around Insadong as it gives you a moment to gather thoughts and find a little bit of peace.
We visited at the time of Buddhas birthday. The colorful lanters added to the shrine.,We happened upon this Buddhist Temple by accident. Our youngest son had said if we had the chance we should visit this location. We had been wandering around the centre of Seoul when we were attracted by the beautiful colours of the lanterns.
A nice temple,A nice Budha temple in the center of th city very coulorfull outside and very impressive inside with lots of people. 
Go for Buddha's birthday,We visited at night time in May and there were thousands of colorful lanterns for Buddha's birthday. Beautiful! Recommended. 
Beautiful Temple,Beautiful Buddhist temple in the middle of the city. Some nice buildings and very interesting statues and surroundings. We were during Buddha's birthday celebration during the day and in the evening. It was magnificent with hundred of lanterns around.
Beautiful lantern temple,"Magical place in the heart of Seoul, the multicolor lanterns make this temple an incredible place to visit at whatever season."
Beautiful tempke,"There was ceremony there, so we heard nice voices singing. The temple was full of people. The interior is beautiful as well."
A must see,"We were there the day before Buddha's birthday, filled with brightly colored lanterns, and lots of monks. We got to see the ceremony of bathing baby Buddha. They fill a ladle and pour water over the small buddha statue 3 times., 1 wash to eliminate all evil thoughts, 2 to cultivate good deals and 3rd wash to save all living beings, "
"Fantastic, especially during Buddha's birthday","I went on May 3, 2017 for the Buddha's Birthday. Though there were thousands of people, I really enjoyed myself. Seeing all the beautiful colorful lanterns hung above our heads; the performance, and cultural events on the side was fun. Jogyesa is also minutes away from Insadong and walking distance to Cheonggychon and Myeongdong. If in the area, I would recommend to visit."
Beautiful Buddhist Temple,"A must see for any visitor to Korea,it has along history,it was established in 1395,a symbol of Korean Buddhism.At the entrance to the temple there are a lot of colorful flags,quite a spectacular sight."
Awesome.,A very spiritual place to visit. Lovely old buildings to see. A local theatre event was most interesting. I approached from the north.No entrances. Must approach from the south.
Middle of Seoul don't miss it,"There are trees over 500 yrs. old on the compound. Open around the clock, get off at Jonggak Station and exit 2.While there ring the huge ancient bell and take advantage of the opportunity to put on a korean traditional costume (men and women) for free and take great photos!"
Incredibly Festive and Welcoming!,They were setting up celebrations for Buddha's birthday and there were thousands of lanterns everywhere. It was an incredible sight to see and the volunteers working there were incredibly helpful and friendly. 
Head Temple,"This is considered the ""head temple"" of Buddhist temples in Korea. A good stop for sure as you wonder around the streets of Insa-Dong scouting for that perfect souvenir."
Amazing place to visit,Nice relaxing temple a stone's throw away from Insadong. I decided to make a short detour since I was visiting Insadong area. Nice quite corner in the city to visit.
Very inspiring,"A very beautiful & sacred place Kind of relax and quite , everybody is worshiping and doing what they believeThere is some kind of misterIous energy around :) I liked it very much "
Strolled upon this,We strolled upon this site and was totally amazed.. We actually witnessed people actually praying. It was an amazing sight.
Pretty amazing ,"First of all, I don't know a lot of the Buddhist religion other than the basics but I was intrigued to see the believers in their prayers and meditations today. The area is getting ready for Buddha's birthday on May 3 so the place is decorated so pretty with bright colourful lanterns. I went inside the temple, sat down and watch people pray. The area is stunning with gold and with the statues. This is a easy excursion to come and you really only need 30 mins to look around and go. "
Very good expereience,I liked this temple a lot. The 3 big Buddhas make and impression and the temple has a strong positive energy inside. I happened to visit at the time of buddhist service which was also powerful. The plaza in front of temple is also a colourful sight. It is just next to Insadong and very easy to reach. So dont miss it if you visit Insadong area!
"Beautiful, Inside & Out","This temple is a stunningly lovely example of the architecture, design, decoration and care put into a worship site for practitioners of Korean Buddhism. Glory in the beauty both inside & outside. Inside, do take care not to disturb the practitioners as they worship. Absolutely worth a stop, you need perhaps 15-20 minutes in total to view everything."
Peaceful,This was my favourite temple in South Korea (I visited 4). It's near Insadong (between Insadong street 10-12) and I spent 2 hours here because I listened to the monks prayer for an hour. The lanterns everywhere are so beautiful and I bought some souvenirs inside the temple shop (they had nice bracelets). Highly recommend this temple.
Jogyesa,This is a colorful and interesting place near the palaces and Insadong. If you can arrive during a Buddhist service it is even more impressive. 
Peaceful and atmospheric ,We were in Insadong and the temple isn't that far away. It was a day of worship with the monks chanting which was a huge highlight. The temple was getting ready for Buddhas birthday. Just wonderful being there!! 
Beautiful and peaceful ,"We are a couple in our 30s from Florida, USA. We enjoyed visiting this temple. The grounds are very big and there is no admission fee to enjoy the scenery and service. We stayed at Lotte City Hotel Myeongdong and it was walking distance to this location. In fact, we walked everywhere. "
Peaceful temple,"I was greeted by three wonderful, friendly ladies serving hot tea which I really appreciated on the chilly, rainy day that I was there. The multi-colored paper lanterns fluttered in the breeze. I was able to observe the Buddhist service taking place in the temple, and look at the other buildings on these grounds."
Worth a wander in,Low key sight which was quieter in the evening but attractively light with lanterns. Lots of atmosphere. Worth 20-30 mins.
Buddhist Central - Flower Displays in November,"Includes Seoul's largest Buddhist Hall. In November the grounds which are free to enter were enhanced by a myriad of flower displays and flower sculptures. Well worth a visit and visitors can sample tmeple life with the Templestay programme tOpposite the temple is an information centre where you can book to do crafts or eat temple food - all for a cost of course, The centre also has information on the Templestay programme through out South Korea."
Deep Spirituality,"During our city tour this was one of the stops, and thank you! When we entered we found the place full of worshippers praying for the peace of the country. We were offered free tea and encouraged to walk around at our leisure. There is a monument which is reputed to contain a fragment of `Buddha's remains, and The statuary is awe-inspiring. This is a very worthwhile stop if you want to take a little time to center yourself."
Very nice temp'e,Very interesting temple in the middle of the city. There is a free guided tour at the entrance for foreigners and guides are very nice and helpful to give information about history and culture of this templeWe got lucky and we're there for the intronisation of the new monkIf you are tired of the palace I strongly recommend this temple

Temple,Very nice Temple in city center. Very colorful around it and surrounding. Our guide was very informative about the temple.

Buddhist temple,Small temple but many people prayer there and my tourist too. Beautiful place n located at city centre.
Great place to meditate,Religion is very important to Koreans. Korean culture and respect for beliefs is interesting if you visit the place 
An active temple close to Insadong,It is always nice to visit temples because of the serenity of the place. It is an active temple that offer homestay for foreigners who wants to learn about Buddhism. Please be mindful and respectful and do not make noise or take picture of them while there are prayers in the main temple where the 3 golden statues are.
biggest indoor Buddha statues in Korea,"I really enjoyed this place, it's beautiful from inside out. You can enter in, however please make sure you take your shoes off, and that you bow once on entry and once on exit. As people pray here, recording and photo is not allowed. These are the biggest indoor stages of 5 m and are really beautiful to look at. We came and sat on the cushion for 10 minutes soaking the atmosphere, recommend to visit when you are in Seoul."
Nice Small Temple,It's not a very grandiose religious building but it has some beautiful architecture and buddhas to look at. 
Good temple but lower your expectations,Its relatively small but it is well located in between tall skyscrapers and offers a different perspective on bustling Seoul
Working Buddhist Temple,Beautiful temple with historic architecture surrounded by the steel and glass of modern Seoul. Real working temple complete with monks and practitioners praying or just meditating in the serene environment. Temple was OK for taking pictures too. Very nice to visit.
amazing temple,"it's a small place but so nice and if you are lucky you will be able to assist to a buda mass, or also and it wasn't my case, you will be able to see the golden buda."
Jogyesa,Not as big as Bongeunsa in Gangnam but is really beautiful. The three big Buddahs look spectacular!!
A really great temple to see,"This temple was my second favorite in Seoul. It's amazing how close it is to the city, and seeing locals come into the temple to pray, directly from work or during tier lunch break is such a great cultural experience. Try to stop and speak to one of those who works at the temple about the statues and other items in the temple."
Cutest Buddha Ever,"We were specifically looking for this temple, while we were walking there found this and realized it was one and the same. Anyway if you are around the area you should go, but not something to go out of your way for. Found the single most cutest Buddha statue ever though!"
Tranquility in the city,Beautiful and well cared for temple in the middle of Seoul. Highly recommend stopping in. It is a spot of tranquility amongst the towering sky scrapers.
