Door for Jinhae,"If you want to visit Jinhae, you will not miss this place , as it is the main entrance to Jinhae. If you have time, you can take bus 309 from city and enjoy sunset on Jinhae To."
Nice place to visit and learn about the ocean,Nice solar tower on the 26th floor of the building! Nice naval museum and oceanarium!Worth the visit which is cheap!
Great for kids,The whole place seemed to be geared for kids. All the kids that we saw there seemed to love the displays especially the interactive one's. I would not recommend this for adults only since the only thing they might find interesting would be the tower or some of the views of the bay. When we visited there was no war ship docked on the island.
"Interesting,beautiful scenery from 120m above","The entire marine park energy is generated by solar power. One can view the well-planned and impressive views from the solar tower at 120m above sea level.Other than this landmark the other pit stops e.g. the warship, museum etc are equally enchanting.Perfect place for families with children."
Changwon Marine Park,"This park is located a little far from the city center. You can go up to the solar tower, this is not free of charge, where you can see even Tsushima Island belonging to Japan in high-visibility weathers. You can see the sea divide and walk to a little islet. Children are collecting seashells in the divided sea."
Good view from Solar tower,"Park consists of display of a Naval warship, Aquarium and a solar tower. One can go upto 27th floor by lift and can have a great view of South sea."
Very interesting solar tower,"We took a taxi from Jinhae - not sure if there are buses that go there. It was such a hot day that we did not want to even chance the commute. The marine park part was interesting, they have some nice shell collections. It cost won 6,000 for 3 adults to enter (there is undercover parking if you go there by car) The 28 floor marine solar tower was very interesting. There was a fee to go up to the top of the tower (can't remember what it was) the view from the top was incredible and although the day was very hot and visibility was poor, I imagine that on a clear day it would be awesome. One whole side of the tower is made up of solar panels! Impressive. Very little English explanation and detail so we were unsure of the details but absolutely worth the visit. They have a navy vessel that one can apparently board but it was closed when we were there ( Korean Thanksgiving holidays) to get back to Jinhae the man at the entrance gate was kind enough to phone for a taxi for us. He really went out of his way and with his limited English and our almost non-existent Korean we managed to get home. This place is out of the way and en route we did notice what looked like huge shipyards."
