Small Taste of this beautiful Marine Park,"The gateway for much of this park is located in Tongyeong, and you can get a great view of several green covered islands from the peak of Hansan-do island. I consider this viewpoint, an excellent introduction to the park. However, for me I hope in the future I have the chance to explore many of the individual uninhabited islands throughout the marine park.The Southern coast of the Korean peninsula is a wealth of hidden gems for the intrepid explorer. Whether you are searching for dinosaur footprints, treasured wetlands, uninhabited islands, or rugged coastline this region of Korea will not disappoint. I very much enjoyed my time here, but it requires a more lengthy exploration"
it more fun if you tour the world,"the national parks of South Korea are preserved parcels of public land in South Korea, on which most forms of development are prohibited. They cover a total of 3.7% of the country's area, and are typically located in mountainous or coastal regions.[1] The country's largest mountain park is Jirisan National Park in the southwest; this was also the first national park to be designated, in 1967. The largest marine park is Dadohaehaesang; it has an area of more than 2,200 km2 (850 sq mi), but almost all of this is water. The smallest park is Wolchulsan, with an area of only 56.1 km2 (21.7 sq mi).There are currently 20 national parks in South Korea; the parks, with the exception of Hallasan National Park, are managed by the Korea National Parks Service, established in 1987.[2] The Authority operates its own police force, and since 1998 has been under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Environment. It was previously under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Construction."
