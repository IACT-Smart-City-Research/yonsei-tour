Breath-taking View from the Top!,"I am an active soccer player and outdoorsy person, so I didn't think the hike up was that difficult, even in summer's peek heat. But I also took my time and thoroughly enjoyed the journey. The view from the top is amazing, and I recommend taking you time to look around from every angle!"
"Great views, trails not easy to find","We decided to take the cable car up the mountain and hike back down. As we were traveling with a car we did not want to hike to the Yonghwasa temple what most people do. The trail is in the woods but it was hot at 35 degrees. Without our Kakao–App we wouldn’t have found the trail to the valley station of the cable car at all as signs are all in Korean. It starts off from the wooden platform between the summit and the great battle viewpoint. First there are some stairs leading to a trail which forks further down into the trail to the Yonghwasa temple and the valley station of the cable car. Views from the summit are great even when the weather was misty. We visited on a busy Sunday during holiday season, but did not have to wait to go up. Parking was very busy though. "
Awesome views from up a height,"Cable car ride up a mountain side. 6 can fit in a car its all very safe and looks well maintained. Costs 14k won per person for a round trip, you would have to be very athletic and have plenty time on your side to walk back down but you can buy a one way ticket at 7k won.Great views of the islands from up top and you can take steps to even higher view points once you disembark from the cable car. There is a nice viewing deck with tables and chairs above the cable car station and it has 2 glass floored wings off its deck. Scarey views of the drop below you. Theres a number of viewing scopes too.Takes around 8 minutes each way in the cable car."
Awesome,"Beautiful scenery, but can’t beat the scenery that greets the eyes form the Jirisan hike @ Saryangdo. The plus point is this ‘san’ is so much more accessible, so those who are interested in great aerial view of the surrounding islands but lack the time, this will be a perfect choice. We cabled up and hiked down via Yonghwasa temple route. At the base, we were so famished that we ventured into one of the local eatery with fantastic food (frequented only by the locals)."
Cable car+ Mireuk Moutain summit + Miraesa temple + woods trail next to Miraesa temple,"Simply wanted to take a cable car to see the ocean but you can enjoy little bit hike to the Mireuk mountain. Also, there is Miraesa temple near to the cable sky walk, going to Miraesa is ok but coming back to cable car to return was a bit hard cause I was exhausted after exploring mireuk mountain and the woods near to Miraesa. Anyway, worth to visit the area. You can enjoy fantastic view towards the ocean and luge track where you can hear screaming from the kids who take luge."
A must in Tongyeong ,"We spent almost full day in this area, started with Luge then took cable car to the mountain. Although its so hot in summer the forest was good escape. We got our selves lost in the forest. If you wanted to reach to the temple you need to be prepared and not tired. The view from top are amazing. Highly recommended "
"A nice, cheap view","The cable cars are like all other cable cars I have been on. They were clean and it was cheap for a round trip, only 11,000 KRW per person. We went late Saturday afternoon and didn't have to wait in line very long. There is a lot to see at the second station with some hiking/stair climbing involved. But it is not required."
Good to enjoy mountain view..,"CY ( 18.05.16 )We visited this mountain by Cable Car. The end of Cable car had road to top of this mountain about 15 minutes. Because of cloudy weather, we couldn't see beautiful view, but the atmosphere was good to us. We just see cloud, but good."
Appx 500 M above Sea level - cool,"Good to go with Family, friends and partners. Cable cart or tracking both the ways are exciting. Nice view of the city and sea. Clean, neat and aesthetic. Could be more fun in winter time. Also experience Luge sports ride no matter what age group you are. Complete one day fun for sure. "
"Beautiful views, easy hike to the top of the mountain from the cable car","This is definitely a must-see if you're in Tongyeong! I did the round trip cable car option. When you get off the cable car at the top, there is a platform with awesome veiws and a small cafe with snacks. From there, it's a short hike up to the summit of Mireuksan. It was pretty packed at the top, but you could squeeze in a few good photos."
Breath taking views ,The telefreak will take you the most way up to the mountain. The other places you will have to by foot. It will takes a lot of climbing stairs but it's well worth it!
"Amazing views of sea, islands and surrounding nature","The cable car takes you most of the way up the mountain- the cars were clean, spacious and felt safe. Once you arrive, there are various routes to the summit - all involve a lot of stairs and is physically demanding. There are lots of viewpoints along the way where you can stop to catch your breath and take pictures. The view from the summit is breath-taking, although it was quite foggy the day I went. It took me 30-45 minutes to reach the summit as I'm not very fit. There are toilets and a café by the cable cars so you can enjoy a well earned beverage before heading back down."
Spectacular View!,"Took the cable car up and needed to hike about 20-30 minutes worth of walk. It was damn tiring but once you reached the top, the view was spectacular. It would make such beautiful photos for memories. The Q for the cable car ride is really long though! So better be there early!"
Super views,We took the cable car up to the top and had fabulous views from the viewing platform. We didn't hike to the summit as it was a hot day even though it was February. Great experience as I had never been on a cable car before.
"Often cloudy. But, good to look down.","This mountain is located in Mireukdo(island) connected with the land by bridges.So, if you wish to reach by foot, you'd better stay at Mireukdo rather than the city center.The height is 461m and it doesn't take long to climb up.The trekking route passing temples can be a little hard at the end and the other one below the ropeway seemed easier.At the observatory, you can see Tongyeong and other islands. It's pretty cool to see.There's a person to explain the history. But, it's only in Korean.In Feb, 2017, the luge circuit is newly opened near the starting point of the ropeway. It could be an another pleasure to enjoy after the mountain."
Worth it to see the view of South sea ocean park,Don't need a round trip. Ride up to the hill to enjoy the view of the area for photo ops and hike down the way. 5-10 mins from the central town by taxi. 
Breathtaking views,"This mountain and view from the top was one of the reasons we booked our trip to Tongyeong. The cable car ride was comfortable. There's some hiking to the summit that takes about 30 minutes, intermediate difficulty, but saw some elderly turn back half way. Loved the view from the summit~!"
Missed the view due to rainy day,It was my last day in Tongyeong and I insisted to go up with canle car even though the ticket box staff discouraged me not to go. Finally she was correct. I couldn't see anything on top. I remember it had beauteaful view with hundreds of small ilands in my earlier visit on sunny day 10 years back..
Great but lots of stairs,It's a bit crowded but the view and breeze was worth the hassle. I hear tickets are bit expensive but we got our tickets through our tour agency so it was a non-issue. My kids grumbled about the stairs but were impressed with the view as well.
Mireuk Mountain ,"Wow! What an experience. The cable car is 9,000 KRW. From the top it starts a small hike to the summit of Mount Mireuksan. Breathtaking views from the top!"
반드시 방문! ,"통영 필수 여행 코스라고 봅니다. 안개낀날에 가서 저는 별로 많은 걸 보진 못했지만 맑은 날 다녀오면 정말 가치가 있다고 하더라구요. 시내 전망과 여러 섬들을 다 보실수있습미다. 처음 가신 분들은 꼭 올라가보시길 바랍니다. 여름에 가실 땐 물을 꼭 챙겨가세요.If it is your first time of the city, you must visit here! You can see the best view of the city and islands."
a great experience with breathtaking views,The cable car ride to the top was well priced and even though we went on a weekend the wait was not too long. I walked to the top and it was well worth it with some extra track off to the side of the extensive boardwalk with lots of viewing platforms. loved it !
Some great views of the Southern Korean sea,The cable car ride itself isn't that great...but there are several great view point near the top of Mireuksan. We were fortunate to go on a weekday without a huge crowd. 
Nice experience,Long queue for the cable car. Waited for almost an 30 minutes for only buying the ticket. But still it was my best cable car experience in Korea. Beautiful view up above the observatory.
Foggy,If you happened to be there when it is raining and foggy. you wont be able to see anything. I enjoyed the cable car ride though.
Mireuksan Mt cable car in Tongyeong,If you are by Tongyeong you can enjoy the view of the mireuksan mt by a cable car. For a cheap charge you can go on this fun ride.
beautiful views but long waiting time,"if the weather is good, this mountain offers great views across the southern coast with its many islands. Far too often, it is hazy, though... I have visited a couple of times for the views but so far, no luck. Plus, it seems impossible to make advance reservations for the cable car, so there are long queues, as many bus tours come as well and fill the cars, as well as impatient Koreans jumping the queue. Should be a more pleasant experience early on a week day in the off season. It is also possible to hike up (or just down) past the temples for more views and peace and quiet."
Mount Mireuk,"There is a rope way to go to the top of Mount Mireuk. At the top of this mount, you can look down over the South Sea which is veery famous for an archipelago. When it is foggy, it is no use getting there since you can't see anything. "
Excellent views,"Mireuksan shows an absolute awesome view over Tongyeong and its waters and Islands. Took a boat tour earlier that morning, learned a bit on the fights of Capt. Yi with the Japanese army and saw the battlefield clearly from the top. Cable car is very busy, however the queues disappear very quickly. Got there by car, however limited parking spaces. "
Get high!,"Beautiful views, weather permitting.Well connected via public transport.Carry water/energy drinks if you wish to go down to visit the temple as there is nothing available on the way down to the temple.People with phobia of heights may avoid this."
Beautiful if weather is nice,"I've been to the mountain twice. Once in October and once in June. Had two less than perfect experiences.The mountain is GORGEOUS. The views are spectacular and the cable car is great.However, if you go on a beautiful weekend day be prepared to wait in a line for the cable car. The cars are moving continuously so there's not a huge wait but you can be waiting a while.Also, check the weather. The second time I went there were clouds so thick at the peak you couldn't see a thing!As most nature goes it's weather permitting!!"
"Great view, but check the weather beforehand!","We came here on a recommendation, and didn't regret it. It's accessible via bus from the main city centre and even though it was winter, there were many couples and families queuing to take the cable car to Mireuksan. The cable car ride was about 10-15 mins, and seemed endless! Not for those with a fear of heights. However, being newly-built, it was perfect for enjoying the view. However, halfway through, it started to get really windy. When we finally reached Mireuksan, there were spectacular views to be had. We took the cable car at around 1pm, and at Mireuksan, it said that the cable car was closing at 3.30pm as the strong winds suggested incoming bad weather, so we had to hurry to the top and get back before the cable car shut down. After the round trip, we saw people who were trying to get tickets for the cable car but had to be turned away due to the early closure that day. That's the thing with outdoor activities here, if the weather is bad you either have to cancel or plans or make sure you have a Plan B. If it had been a sunny day, the view would have been a hundred times better. Still worth a trip though. Great for nature-lovers, but check the weather before coming down!"
