Theme park about Korea as a divided country.,"C ( 19.10.20 ) There was located beside Panmunjeom and the northernmost area in South Korea. The park had wide parking area, and exhibits about divided country's history. There was a part of our sad history, and included many meanings. There was good point to walk around with many history, and could view North Korea scenery."
Great place to experience DMZ ,"It is great park, where you can see DMZ, mountains in North Korea side, no return bridge.... The park there was really beautiful. You can camp if the weather is nice."
A sort of pleasure park,This park has a number of Korean War sites and is the first stop on most DMZ tours. There is the Freedom Bridge and the remains of a derailed trains. A bit of a tourist trap but interesting.
Korean War History,"Went here as part of a DMZ tour and saw a piece of history. From a demolished bridge, to an old train that was shot up and recovered in the area. There are several lookout points as well to look across the river into North Korea."
Interesting Piece of History,The park is a bit of a tourust trap and it's most peoples first stop inside the DMZ. Nevertheless it has some interesting monuments and of course the Peace Bridge.The Peace Bridge was used at the end of the Korean War to exchange thousands of prisoners of war from both sides. Its blocked off at the North entrance now with razor wire and the like because of a murderous incursion years back. That only serves to make it look more foreboding and of it's time.You can walk the full length from the southern side as far as the blocked northern entrance. The best thing about Imjingak in my opinion.There is a beautiful peace bell and a lovely peace monument using stones taken from I think 86 different conflict zones throughout the world A train carriagecremsins from the line that used to run here before the bombs of war.I really enjoyed the whole place actually.
A very interesting place to visit!,"A very interesting place to visit! Especially if you are curious about the history of North and South Korea separation. You can see the steam locomotive that was shot and derailed by bombs in the Korean war; the destroyed railway that was heading to Pyeongyang; the bridge of freedom; memorials of the separation; and a peaceful park that was built to console the families that got separated during the war.Still in the area, there is a stunning park with thousands of colorful pinwheels. Near the park you can find a simple amusement park to enjoy some thrilling rides. "
Imjingak Nuri Park,You will witness remnants of bullets during the Korean War as well as well-wishers that one day North and South Korea will be reunited.
The train is interesting ,Here you can see the freedom bridge.We felt that the train here was fascinating - destroyed in the Korean War it was moved here so people could witness what happened. On the train there are bullet holes and the wheels are bent. There’s also a wall of prayers. Also a souvenir shop. 
The best park for history,Have you ever curious about how the relationship between North and South korea? you need to come here. in here you don't need tour to come because this place actually still not inside DMZ area. but in the border between DMZ and normal area. in here there is a park that so satisfying to enjoy your spare time.
No tour needed...,"...to visit this park. I think it would be a wonderful place to bring the family on a weekend as a day trip from Seoul. Quite a few monuments to see as well as an old train locomotive. I could imagine hanging out with friends on the little lake below the bridge - maybe a picnic. Why not? If you got kids, it could be educational as well. Maybe jump into Paju town afterwards."
Worth an afternoon trip,"I was on a long business trip in Seoul. Since we had an afternoon free, my colleagues and I took a half day tour of the DMZ.Right at the start, my recommendation would be to take the full day tour which atleast gets you closer. The half day tour does cover a few areas but it isn't the same.The park is the first stop on the tour and the key attraction was the shot up locomotive.We then moved on to other areas. I'd probably consider spending not more than 30 minutes here."
A must see at DMZ,"The Park is The first shop OF The tour. There is a small carnival/rides Park, some restaurants and monuments. Our guide brought US The The monuments about The War, los OF loved ones and The train wreaked during The conflict. The area is wide. There was a kita flying activity by Families when we visited. A must place to see and spend time."
Informative,This park is right next to the DMZ. This is the closest zone to North Korea. There are written information to understand what happened between North and South Korea conflict. There’s an old train stuck during the war and it is well preserved and documented. There’s a freedom bridge and they call it the bridge of no return. The ribbons with written wishes for their relatives in North Korea depict sadness and even the music they play.It’s really a park that will remind you of their sad story. Try to go to the observation deck and the view is great because of the golden ricefield of autumn. Don’t go on Mondays because the park is close but you can still walk around. There are stalls and restaurants where you can buy food if you’re hungry. One hour for me is enough to walk around and go to the next spot to visit in Paju.
The best to visit during Ginseng Festival in October.,"This is a park close to North Korea. There are a tiny amusement park, a huge square and a public park.We had much fun visiting in October for Ginseng Festival. It was so crowded and lots of things to see.- The amusement park was okay. Not that cheap, though.- There were a number of little flies near the pond. It wasn't that pleasant.- Other than the public park with hills, there are decent observatory, broken bridge, monuments and some other things to see. Also, good restaurants and snack bars. - How to reach:About one hour of Gyeongeui Line from Gongdeok Metro Station. Out of Munsan Station exit #1, we had a free shuttle specifically prepared for the festival. It seems bus #58 goes there at normal time. About 30 min ride."
Colourful and extensive first stop on our DMZ tour,"I arrived here with a small group of international tourists in our comfortable tour bus from Seoul. The first impression was of many colourful tent like structures in the extensive car park. It is actually located 7 km from the Military Demarcation Line on the banks of the Imjin river.Here you can visit the Bridge of Freedom, which South Koreans crossed when they came back to their mother country from North Korea after the signing of the Armistice Agreement. You can also see vestiges of the Gyeongui Train Line which was destroyed during the Korean War in 1950. In the short time we had to explore this site I headed to the observatory deck to take a good overall look at the interesting lie of the land. I then strolled over to a sad looking, totally rusted up steam train which had been shot to pieces as witnessed by all the bullet and shrapnel damage.That was it - I didn't have time to see the many monuments, statues and memorials of the Korean war. The tour guide had already called us all together to move on to the next stage of our rather hectic tour."
Super Park with numerous memorials,A well done facility with numerous memorials. Lots of artistic statues and thoughtful representations of peace and reunifications. Hard to pick a favorite. Perhaps the solemness of the bridge of freedom to enable the prisoner exchange or maybe the wall of prayers. The underground bunker is pretty chilling. The peace bell is also very nice. Only thing out of place is the included amusement park for the children. I don’t get that. Nice place to spend a few hours and reflect.
Remembrance,"This is a war memorial park with lots of pictures, statures, monuments and other memorials in remembrance of the various people who served and lost their lives during the Korean War."
Highly recommended,"Very great trip, that provided a good experience and also a lot of information. Would definitely recommend when visiting Korea."
Interesting in context,"Interesting to visit in terms of its context in history and status, however physically or in terms of new information, It is not unusual or compelling."
Sad but projects a hopeful message,"Like all war memorial parks, the site shows a lot of Korean War photos and artifacts that can be a bit heavy to take in. However the message (reunification) is very promising and uplifting."
Closest I've been to North Korea,"When we arrived, we were taken to the 3rd Tunnel dug by the North Korean army to invade Seoul. Walking through those tunnels gave you a sense of what it might’ve been for the soldiers working and sleeping there. Afterwards, we headed towards the observation platform. You will great some great views of North Korea. You might even see some of the locals riding bicycles. There’s a line on the platform stating what you can/can’t do on each side of the line. Careful you don’t cross that line though. You have to stay behind the line if you’re taking pictures towards North Korea. You can cross the line if you’re not taking photos. You are being watched zby soldiers that will confiscate your camera if they catch you taking pictures and erase the content."
First Stop of DMZ Tour,"Our tour bus stopped here during our tour to the DMZ. It took about 50 minutes to get here from Seoul. Stop was supposed to be 15 minutes which was not really long enough to see everything here.There is an old steam locomotive from the Korean War on display next to a souvenir shop. For a view of the surrounding area, there is an observation platform located next to a building with several restaurants and a gift shop. Other interesting sights in the park include the Bell of Peace, the Mangbaeddan Memorial Altar, and the Bridge of Freedom."
DMZ themed park that has some of everything,"Imjingak is probably the closest park to the DMZ that is able to be assessed by the public freely, with numerous DMZ themed attractions. There is a steam train hailing from the Korean era that is on display here and also a bridge that extends into the DMZ.There are a lot of facilities here from eateries, shops and convenience stores. There is also an observation deck that allows visitors to peek into the DMZ. There is also a theme park nearby, which is kinda odd.Not as good as entering the DMZ itself, but if you're not able to get a tour into the DMZ, this park is probably the next best thing. Not a really big place though, you can at most spend about an hour here if you don't visit the theme park."
Imjin Gak day trip,"I was feeling nostalgic, so I thought I'd take a trip to Imjin Gak. Hadn't been for a few years. I always enjoy the time there. This time I explored a part I hadnt seen before. The park area to the right as you come in. A nice walk with some art sculptures a pub and a couple of eateries. I highly recommend for history buffs or someone looking to getaway for a day."
Offers Something For Everyone,"This is a unique park that is unlike any I have seen in the U.S. It truly has something to offer for a wide variety of interests. In addition to several lovely outdoor space one would expect at a park, there’s a small amusement park with rides, a three-story mini-mall with a variety of stores and restaurants and an observation deck on top, an old American bunker converted into an interactive museum, and an outdoor exhibit on a series of train tracks/train that were destroyed during the Korean War and the remains of which still stand to this day, with piers straddling the Imjin River. Highly recommend this park."
Korean War’s place of grief and agony,"There is an ongoing renovation of the place, according to Judy our korean guide. They will erect something to commemorate the recent historic meeting of north and south korea and at at least ending the war. "
Interesting exhibits here.,"A few nice monuments/statues, the last rail car relic, a pond, and viewing of the DMZ. Visibility was quite poor when we were there. The building has a couple restaurants, food stalls, bathrooms, souvenirs. This would be part of your DMZ tour."
Interesting Place,"A local friend brought us here on a day trip. The DMZ is a strip of land between North Korea and South Korea. It was created through an agreement between North Korea, China and the United Nations in 1953, and spans 250 km long, and about 4 km wide with 2 km on each side of the militarized line. There are two parts to the DMZ zone area – unrestricted and highly restricted (requires the official DMZ tours).Located within this zone is the Imjingak Resort, within Paju City. It was built with hope that unification would someday be possible between North and South Korea, with tributes and mementos throughout the resort.Imjingak is one of the places where authentic North Korean food and souvenirs are being sold as well. It was quite odd seeing a mini theme park, Pyeong Hwa Land, amidst all the solidarity and solemnness of what Imjingak is supposed to represent. But I guess you can take it as, in spite of the difficulties in life we ought to not forget to have fun and relax from time to time. This would be one of the stops that gives some insight not the complex relationship between the two countries, with tributes and monuments to the war and hopes of reconcilliation. If you are interested in history, than this might be a good stop. For more on my experience and photos, do check out my blog .^^"
Interesting but not fascinating.,"We stopped here for 20 mins on the way to the DMZ. Whilst I wouldn’t make a special trip to see this park it was interesting to walk around for a short time. You can view the bridge, an old train and the old railway line. Some more context would have been useful for visitors."
Imjingak Park,Interesting place to understand the history of Korea. Most DMZ tour operators stop here to show the park. Worth visiting for Korea visitors.
Scary!,This park is near the Line which separates North Korea from South Korea. They have facsimiles of the Third Tunnel built by the North to invade the South. There is a Bell of Peace.
Imjingak Park,"Imjingak is where the car and bus tours have to park, and discharge their passengers into escorted buses up to the Border and DMZ. Apart from an enormous parking area, there are exhibits and statues depicting various aspects of the conflict with the North."
Lunch Stop,"I came to Imjingak Pyeonghoa-Nuri Park as a lunch stop with my tour group to see the JSA at the demilitarized zone. There were a few historical things to see here, a small amusement park, and a few places to eat. It isn't a place that I would go out of my way just to see but it was a nice stop on the way to my destination. I ate at the Rodem Restaurant (로템 레스토랑) which served delicious traditional Korean cuisine and I tried a cane ice cream cone from the neighboring convenient store which was also delicious."
DMZ tour,"If you wish to do the DMZ tour (DMZ only, no JSA) without paying too much to the tour agencies, you can visit this park and join the tour from there. It is the same tour provided by the tour agencies but you pay half the price including the train/bus fares. Take the train to Munsan Terminal and you will have the options of taking bus/train to Imjingak park. I took a bus there and it took bout half an hour to get there. Ask the staff at the info centre at Munsan Terminal for the direction and bus number.Simply head to the info centre when are you reach Imjingak to book the tour. Please check out my photo showing the timeslots and the fees. I booked the tour course A which cost me 9,200 won, and the tour includes visit to Dorasan Station, Dora observatory, Third tunnel and a small local shop selling local products. At the end it cost me 17,000 won to do the tour travelling from Seoul and return, and i think the averag tour price provided by tour agencies cost around 40,000 won.Be sure to spend some time to explore the park and the freedom bridge."
A short stop at this park,We had a short stop in this place to take pictures and had a chance to read the history of this park. You will see that Stones of Peace wall. 
"Big Park, Tour Place",This is a large park area and includes some DMZ souvenir shops. Our guide told us that they have large festivals at this park. They have some memorials here of the families that got separated because of the war. It is summer but this area was not busy the day we were there. Really the tourist visit to catch their tours(To Travel Is To Live)
Nice views,This venue offers good views of the train and the bridges. It has a few stairs involved but is actually quite easy to get around.
Plenty of views here of the DMZ areas and lots of food outlets,Well worth a stop here with memorabilia and some feelings of the terrible emotional issues created by the separation of Families cased by this terrible war
Historical site that is a bit surreal,"Interesting place full of somber history, memorials and displays which starkly contrasts with the amusement park and stores selling DMZ souvenirs. An interesting place, but do you want a DMZ tote bag or coffee mug to remember the war and the dead? Lots of school children out on field trip contrasting with the bridge of no return closed to the public because of North Korean mines on the other end to deter defectors. A place of contrasts."
A piece of history,"We booked a private tour for 6 to the DMZ from Seoul and I must say it was worth the time and effort to go, especially with the current tensions with respect to the North. The park is the staging point for travel to a spot closer the front line. It is also an educational center where you can understand the history, and see some of the old war relics and monument. There is an amusement park for kids and plenty of things to eat. Lots of local souvenirs, all of which retracts from the reasoning for the park but a necessity. "
Historic landmark,"The Admission: FREE to the parkThe Park: Many status remembering those soldiers during the war. Very informative and educational. There are food vendors on site. A great place to know about Korean history. The Parking: 1,000 or 2,000 won for parking."
Historical location,"There are many things to do and see here. Try to see as much as possible there is a lot you can learn about at Imjingak. We where there during the ginseng festival, we got to try some ginseng well there. Try some of the street food as well. Just remember well there that this is a place of great sadness and hope as well."
Nice park near to North Korea.,"There are many amusing place such as marry go round, Viking, Kids for rides, Kite-Flying, Korean shuttlecock, archery and so on."
Symbol of pain and hope,"This is located 50 km northwest of Seoul. It is about a 40 minute drive on Freedom Road (Jayu Ro). The Kyung-Ui Railroad which is proposed to connect South and North Korea when completed passes through this park. Every New Year's Days, there is a Joint memorial service to comfort the 10 million South Koreans separated from their families in North Korea. Being here gives you mixed feelings of the pain of separation an hope for reconciliation."
Great place to visit,"Nice place to visit peaceful and a lot to see, have to visit DMZ once in South KoreaA big park and nice place to spend time going around and definitely if you have kidsPast and present at the same time"
Historically important site,"This area, visited as part of the Demilitarized Zone Tour we saw the Freedom Bridge or 'Bridge of No Return' where North and South Korea exchanged prisoners. No-one can cross the bridge.There is a park with shop and restaurant facilities. Of interest is an old train engine damaged by gunfire. There are wonderful views from the Observatory."
Spring/Summer/Fall getaway,"Not only does this park offer a nice display of Korean War history, it has food, a lot of green fields, and an amusement park for a weekend getaway with your family. Definitely a nice place to visit and check out to sit back and relax with your family."
A nice end to my tour,"This park was a nice way to end my DMZ tour. It was a quick visit, but still long enough to appreciate all that was there."
Part of DMZ tour.,"part of SMZ tour. A few things to see, train, bridge and views over the river. The ribbons tied to the walls as hope for reunification are quite beautiful and moving. There is a good little coffee shack by the buss stop."
One of the must go spot near DMZ,"This is part of the DMZ tour and the town was built a couple decades after the Korean War armistice and stands as a symbol of hope that, someday, reunification between the North and South will take place. Since the theme of reunification is so strong in this area, 평화누리 공원 was built in 2005 as part of a Global Peace Festival sponsored by Gyeonggi-do."
Introduction to DMZ,"Imjingak is the place located on the banks of the Imjin River which often serves as first stop during exploration of DMZ. It is surrounded by the Unification Park. The parking is ample, the area is large and initially confusing. The best place to start with is the 3 story elevated observation deck allowing for the aerial view beyond Imjin River and towards North Korea. The Bridge of Freedom does not cross the river but is located where the former railroad bridge was located. There is a North Korea Center with its exhibits. Mangbaeddan Alter is a monument allowing Koreans for prayer, reflection and paying respects to ancestors on the other side of the boarder.This is a soothing destination where they seem to find a modicum of peace. A battered locomotive is on display. There are many monuments, statues, pagoda, wall of commemorative ribbons. There are also souvenir stores accommodating tourists. Before you head to Third tunnel Imjingak is the logical first stop offering an overview of DMZ."
Trip to Famed DMZ,"I visited Imjingak recently, I liked the atmosphere, saw the rail engine that bought koreans from north korea, etc. Its part of the whole DMZ tour. "
The first stop,On the DMZ tour it is the first stop. We did not stop for long. There is a bullet riddled old train that you can look at. It is the first glimpse of all the barbed wire to come. We did the morning half day tour.
Look at the markers of history here & then at the mostly elderly on a pilgram trip across the river,"Our Korean-born tour guide helped delivery history lessons as our group's tour bus rolled down the highway toward the 38th parallel & this was our 2nd. stop after the musuem & observation deck, with relatively few PRC mainland tourists rushing all over, it was good to enjoy and take in history - the park, the bridge, the train, the temple/shrine, the viewing stands and some of the elderly Koreans who arrived by car with the younger generation as escort - some frail & needing help in walking and getting around. Families & generations remained apart with the South & North division and armed separations - and, while we're there - ""fat boy"" was apparently stirring up tension so the SK military was out in full force patrolling & drilling.The train locomotive engine was used for the last train that managed to get out of NK, taking easily 10,000 rounds of assorted ammunitions shot at it - short of using rockets. Peace Bridge was once connected across the river but siblings cannot & have not been able to walk across for 65 years - thus, the elderly still come here hoping to see & get re-united as they are aging, leaving those ribbon messages on the wired fence. The memorial, prayer stations, viewing platforms, temple & shrine just help to put the message together - with and without the language translations of a country torn apart and divided - the price of freedom that many take for granted."
Stopped there for lunch,"Just stopped there to have lunch on our way back from the DMZ. It didn't look like there were many rides working, maybe it was off season. Lunch was good though at the Traditional Restaurant."
You have to start here,"We took full day tour through Cosmojin from Seoul. Our first stop (after the obligatory amethyst factory/shop) was here. We ate lunch (bibimbap) at one of the restaurants and then had about 15 minutes to look around the historical monuments. We did not go to the amusement park.Stopping here gets you prepared for what's to come. There's the Freedom Bridge, several monuments, and an old bullet-riddled steam locomotive."
Must Place to Visit in South Korea,Imjingak is located on the border between north and south Korea. This is a very interesting area because can easily be seen any place from here and especially easy when standing on the viewing area of the Imjingak Visitor Center. The Freedom Bridge connects north and south Korea with military personnel from both sides stand guard - how exciting! This is another must place to visit while in South Korea.
Glad this was part of our tour,This was one stop on our tour which took us to the DMZ. Recommend doing it via tour as opposed to on your own.Here you can see the Freedom Bridge. There is a small amusement park. Nothing to see on the North Korean side except plants and wildlife but surreal non the less! There is also an old train car situated here with bullet holes.
Surreal,"We were in Seoul for meetings and had 1/2 day to sightsee. Rather than a tour, we hired a taxi to take us to the North Korean border. Seeing the Freedom bridge was surreal. It's hard to believe this uneasy truce has been/lasted for 55+ years. It is something to see. If we had more time, I'd like to see the DMZ...but we certainly got the feeling where we visited."
Beautiful and very sad,"This is a beautiful park that was built to console the family members of those who remain separated in the two Koreas. There are numerous sculptures, viewing platforms, restaurants and even a small amusement park that was closed the day we were there. "
Part of DMZ Tour. Excellent Korean food at the rest area.,We went to this park cause it was a stopover for lunch for our DMZ tour. The restaurant (the one in the centre) serves really nice stew beef pot with kimchi. Must try that. This park has a lot of interesting history of the Korean War. Suggest to take a full day DMZ tour as this place is not very accessible.
the Freedom Bridge,"This is where last bridge between North and South Korea remains, and there is a spectacularly shot up locomotive on display with loco sounds! Also a peace bell. One hopes for peace for Korea."
Rich History,"We visited this place as part of the DMZ JSA tour. Here we can see the Bridge of Freedom which was used to exchange PoWs, and the Mangbaeddan, which is a monument for displaced persons whose family is in North Korea to pay their respects to them. Nice photo-ops but unfortunately, the place was full of rude mainland Chinese speaking loudly, pushing and jostling around, and generally disturbing the peace."
Place of Reflection,"Among all the DMZ tour sites, I thought the Imjingak Park was the most meaningful and moving. There's the famous ""Bridge of Freedom"", which was built as a walkway for the sole purpose of trading prisoners of war after the Korean War; the barbed wire fence holding streams of colourful ribbons, with messages to relatives still in the North or those who have died in the North; a peace bell; a collection of stones from walls that divided countries in the past (this was really amazing); a relic of a bombed locomotive; and an altar for ancestors and families living in the North, and for prayers for reunification.My experience here was marred by the presence of loud, uncouth and rude Chinese tourists, who were jostling about and climbing over displays and relics just to get a picture. They clearly paid no heed to the signs asking visitors not to step up to the display, signs that were in Korean, English and of course, Mandarin. For a sombre place, made worse by China's crucial role in keeping the Koreas divided, these tourists sure knew how to make a fool and nuisance of themselves (see my pictures to believe it). Many other tourists were clearly disgusted, while my Korean tour guide had a pained, angry yet resigned look on her. I felt sorry for her, but realised that even if I screamed at the tourists, they were going to look back at me like dumb pandas anyway.Anyway. This place is also a good pit stop location, with some good coffee and snacks to keep you going for the rest of the tour.But yeah, find a way to ban the Chinese tourists from this place, please. They can return when they are ready to be respectful and sensitive to the history and cultures of others."
"Nice history stop, photo, food","Stopped here to see some of the local sites, this has lots of history of what happened here, great place to take some photos and gift shops, food on site. The train used to transport items by rail is on site, blown up but worth the knowledge gained by seeing this site. This area has lots of busses coming through full of different nationalities, very interesting place."
Nice place,You can see the old train that transported people from the North and the various bands that were tied by people who have relatives on both sides.
Surprisingly another knowledge gain,"I, myself is a Korean fanatic and I didn't expect they will have this kind of historical sites. My family like the place especially my hubby who is a history buff. There's alot to explore such statues, different stones corner, the bridge, train to have photo ops for souvenirs. My husband is really amazed with the remnant of the train from the previous war. "
photo opportunity,"It's a large area, mostly a car park. The chance to take some photos and get a drink but realistically it is just a pit stop and not much more."
Interesting Statues and Such,I wish we had been given more time to explore this park. I felt rushed and probably only saw about one third of it. You get a view of the Freedom Bridge and a train car full of bullet holes. There are many statues and monuments here.This is where you get tickets. It also has restaurants and shops.
A view into Korean history from the 1950's,"The area is basically way less romantic than imagined, and has a rather sad history, especially if you look across and see Panmunjeon and also Kaeseong from a distance. I went with 2 friends(a Taiwanese and a South Korean senior), and could speak Korean myself, but right down there, I felt as if that area had been converted partially into a camping ground. "
Beautiful Peace Park - more time needed,"The surreal peace park was created as part of the Gyeonggi Province ""Global Peace Festival"" in 2005. It is a wonderful respite and visually appealing area that looks different according to each season. A short stroll from the main Imjingak area (where the Tour buses stop and the main attractions like the Bridge of Freedom are found) - the park is very large in area. Sculptures are found across the landscape and peace 'pin wheels' are found lined across the hills. Kites are flown on nice clear days - and you'll see children around the park area. If you are taking the combined DMZ/JSA tour - your chance to see and enjoy this park is after lunch - you may have an hour or so where you can wander off and enjoy this 'hidden' area."
Altruistic but interesting,"I liked this sculpture, very simple but tells a great story. Made with rocks collected from the major battlefields of history, spanning all continents. It is off to the right of the train so you have to look for it to enjoy it."
Not enough time given to visit,Liked the history and the viewsDisliked not being given long enough on the tour to have a look around
"Just a huge Parking lot, loo break, f&b stop and staging area","just a pit stop, no need to explore...travelers headed to the DMZ or Panmunjeon can skip it."
