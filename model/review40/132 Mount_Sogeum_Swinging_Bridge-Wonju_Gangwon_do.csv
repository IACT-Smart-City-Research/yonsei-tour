Never made it!,"Unfortunately we didn’t have time to walk this bridge but it looked great going between two hills over the river. However, the road leading to it is packed with food stalls which sold some lovely treats! Don’t miss them."
loved this place,"the walk is quite short, but really exciting. I love nature, so it was awesome to me. Therefore, you should keep in mind that there is a lot of people there on weekends, so you might not be able to take nice pictures"
Beautiful scenery,Climb up to get to the swinging bridge. Beautiful scenery will help you walk up hundreds of stairs. It must be worth it!
578 steps of stairs to bridge entrance... ,I went on a Thursday with a small group of tour. Reached there about 2pm. Wasn't that many people. Some koreans and few elderly couples. Can rest along the way up if tired. There's another walkway that just open recently.
Too many people,"We went there on a Korea holiday and it was top crowded. If there weren't too many tourists, we could reach the bridge after 15~20 minutes hiking, but we spent around 30 minutes only for hiking. When we walked across the bridge, we could only walk slowly because there were also too many people who enjoyed the bridge while taking photos. I think it should be limitation for the tourists to walk across the bridge. "
having good holiday.,You can take bus from wonju railway station and also wonju express bus terminal. We are really happy to come this place. the bridge is good and over look site as well.
Too much trash,I’ve visited this area 3 times in the past two years. I visited again in September. It used to be my favorite area in Wonju County. Now it’s my least favorite. There were too people like an amusement park and they were throwing trash everywhere mainly off the hiking course on the mountain. So I don’t like it anymore. I also think 3000won is a little steep for only walking on the bridge. If this is treated like a natural place with proper waste bins and less thought of as an amusement park then I will go back. 
"Exiciting place in Wonju, Gangwon-do",This is one of the must visit place in Wonju. When we visit it was free of cost. We enjoyed very much as because this place is full of incredible natural landscape. You can take bus from wonju railway station and also wonju express bus terminal with cost of 1200 won per one way trip.
Great summer day trip!,"The bridge is a great sight, they’re really developing the area but sadly you now have to pay to go up to it. It cost 3,000₩ but it’s totally worth it. They’re in the process of building a cable car up, it looked like. So until that’s done you must take the stairs. It makes the perfect day trip to Wonju, start with the rail bikes in the morning (A short 5-10 min walk up the road from the bridge entrance) then head over to the bridge. After you come down you can swim in the river below and there’s a bunch of little places for food and drinks, also in the summer there’s a lifeguard on duty. It’s a really cute area, I can’t wait to see what else they build here. The rail bikes take about an hour then the bridge is about another hour and a half."
Fun activity ,"This is a newly built suspension bridge in Wonju. It is currently free of charge to walk across, but my understanding is that they will start to charge admission once the construction work around the area is completed. You must walk up a series of stairs, for about 10 to 15 minutes, in order to get to the bridge. Walking across is fun, and there are some nice views to enjoy. Besides walking across the bridge, it looked like there were some trails to hike and a rail bike park, but we didn’t check either place out since I was part of a tour, and we had to get to our next destination. So, not sure if there is enough stuff there to make it a full day’s worth of activities, but walking across the bridge was a fun way to spend an hour."
"Amazing views, amazingly busy",Newly created 200 metre long swing/suspension bridge with beautiful views. I couldn't believe how popular this place was with local tourists.
