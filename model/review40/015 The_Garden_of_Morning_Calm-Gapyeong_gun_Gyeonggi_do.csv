Relaxing experience while strolling,Enjoyed the cool breeze and smell of pine trees also its relaxing to hear the birds chirping. Our Tour guide also give us some trivia where love in the moonlight was shot for film location and its in the Pond. Aaron from Ktour story give us story behind the reason why Garden of morning calm was made.
This is my favorite place in Korea ,"I have been here over 10 times throughout the years and it still remains as one of my top places in Korea. This 30,000 sq m mountain garden is quite majestic in its natural beauty. It can be accessed by hop on hop off your bus from Gapyeong station or Cheongpyeong station. You can also take a taxi right from Gapyeong station which is what we did and it costed around 30,000 won. The garden is truly beautiful during all seasons but my favorite is during the fall when vibrant colors mark the park like dotted spaces. There is a cafe and restaurant at the park and lots of resting spaces. Right in front of the entrance to the Garden they also sell snacks and local food you can take with you. Go check out this place, it will take you on a relaxing adventure for the soul!"
Romantic Place to visit,"I'm glad to have visited this awesome garden during autmn season last November 16, 2019. I would like to think that this is The Garden of Eden. A must visit place if you are a nature lover."
Beautiful garden all year round,I visited this garden each time I went to Seoul. In spring there were lots of flowers. In autumn there were not only autumn colours but also lots of flowers. They really kept the garden in good order.
"Visit to Garden of Morning Calm, Petite France, Nami Island","The Garden was a pleasure to visit and walk. Landscaping and foliage are excellent. Soft soothing music in the background enhanced the pleasure of strolling and relaxing in the beautiful grounds. At Petite France, soothing music was also played in the background - seems like a common feature in parks... Petite France has lots of French-inspired (as its name implies) architecture especially images / statues of the Petit Prince which are a big plus for a fan like me!Re-visiting Nami Island was great (last visit 10 years ago was in winter) as the gingko trees were changing shade to yellow.Check with your hotel concierge for a day tour to Nami Island, Garden of the Morning Calm and Petite France - it's really worth the 130,000 wons (organised by Cosmojin travel agency, includes chicken bbq lunch)"
Beautiful garden,"If you are planning to go here, you need at least half a day to finish walking the whole garden. Not recommended to follow tour group."
Garden that will blow your mind away,I would prefer The Garden of Morning Calm compared to Nami Island. Not too commercialize and can feel the freshness in the air. I love this place!
Beautiful garden,Love this beautiful garden! We came in the morning and enjoyed the cool crisp morning air with lesser crowd. The garden is perfectly manicured with lots of beautiful pathways
Garden of perfect serenity,"Gardens are beautifully manicured and well kept. It was autumn so the leaves had already started turning and falling. This place is definitely worth a few hours if you enjoy the peace and serenity of nature, even more if you want to get great photos and are a fan of horticulture."
Seoul2019,"This is one place you shouldnt miss when going on a trip to Seoul. Autumn, for me, is the best time with bursts of yellow,red and orange complementing the spectacular garden foliage. Photos taken here are definitely keepers!"
"A delight for the eyes, calming for the senses ","After the congestion of Seoul, this is a welcome respite. Lots of nice walking paths, but there are hills. Definitely felt the calmness and peace. We arrived fairly early and noticed more people arriving later in the day. If you feel the need to slow down, this is the place to go. "
Beautiful oasis of peace ,We had a wonderful time walking and enjoying the chrysanthemums. It was chrysanthemum season and the leaves were changing and getting autumny. Beautiful. 
A peaceful autumn morning,Just beautiful to go during Autumn where the beautiful colors come out with such lovely cooling weather. Varieties of flora to explore. Went with a day local tour as 1 out of 4 locations to go but felt rushed as we were given only 1 hour to walk around. Would go back again myself to take time exploring the area 
I Seoul U,Magnificent!!Very beautiful !!! You will indeed feel calm and belongs to nature. Must visit in Korea 
Garden of Morning Calm,Beautiful landscape with gorgeous bonsai trees. Excellent photo shooting place can easily spend half day walking around enjoying the stroll. Comfy walking shoes needed. 
Gorgeous gardens - well worth a visit,"A common accompaniment on the tours out to Nami Island and Petite France, the Garden of Morning Calm is perhaps the highlight of such tours. Visiting at the right time, early morning or mid-late afternoon when the light is right, the gardens are a calm and peaceful experience. Many of the trees, shrubs and flowers are not seen in Australia. A highlight of the tour is the Gardenshop with many interesting skincare and other products based on many common plants such as lavender, jasmine, mint etc"
Beautiful Gardens,This was an amazing garden. Very spread out. Plan for lots of hilly walking. If you want to visit when it's quiet definitely come first thing in the morning. In my opinion the admissions fee was a bit pricey. My children weren't too impressed as this was our 3rd day of lots of walking so we didn't stay too long. 
Beautiful but perhaps not the right timing,"Visited this place in the summer and while I do agree that the garden is really big and filled with many beautiful plants and flowers, I think the place requires the right season for one to enjoy (e.g. Spring time or Christmas) when they have more spectacular displays. "
Ohhh yes,"Grea, Great, Great, lovely place to go, beautiful, the nature view and it is peaceful, you must go, ."
Picturesque,"Beautiful landscape, beautiful gardens. Enjoyed walking in the gardens, crossing on the suspension bridge, having a coffee taking in the serene surroundings. The beauty of this place does give a very calming feel. We had a chance of harvesting pinenuts — a thrill for us city dwellers."
Happy People Garden ,Beautiful scenery with thousands of flower plants and trees. Some spices are imported from other countries. Gardening are well maintained. By boat cruise to the island crossing the cool windy blue water lake. 
The Garden of Morning Calm,"This is the shooting place of a Korean Telenovela. The area is big and full of very nice plants and trees. Fantastic landscaping, you need the whole afternoon to see it. A must to see."
Serene,The nature perfect garden brings serenity. Walking around the garden was good physical exercise too.
Beautiful sights to wander around and take photos,"This place was breathtaking. The garden is massive and everywhere you look is an amazing view. From the mountains, to the cherry blossoms, to the tulips and Japanese gardens.It’s a big place to allot at least a few hours to go around especially if you want to take good photos. Highly recommended!"
Wow - must visit!,"One of my highlights of visiting Seoul - this place is a must-visit! I'm thoroughly impressed with the beauty of the garden with its beautiful greenery, flowers, and picturesque setting. Plenty of photo opportunities at this place.We took a tour and had about 2-hours to explore this place but I feel even then it's not enough to visit all of the areas. Most of the areas are stroller and wheelchair friendly but some parts are not. Lucky the weather was kind to us but if it rained, there is little shelter so if it may rain, it'll be better to take an umbrella or raincoat with you."

ORBooked thru KKDay for less-hassle tour.You will really enjoy the place."
A Psychedelic Distraction: The Garden of Morning Calm Lights Festival,"When I visited The Garden of Morning Calm; it was at the tail-end of its 2018 Lights Festival called Light Travel. Thousands of colorful bulbs light up the gardens in all imaginable shapes and hues: from animals, to hearts, to random blurbs. Up close, the lights become too tacky and gaudy; so I highly recommend going to spots which give you a bird's eye view of the gardens below to appreciate it. The lights do distract you from the beauty of the gardens' natural beauty (especially since they recommend visiting the gardens dusk time onwards due to the lights); but perhaps it's the best way to present the gardens during the winter-early spring season when it's at it's least photogenic.I'd love to come back to see the gardens in their raw beauty though."
Beautifully landscaped gardens,"A beautifully landscaped gardens atop a scenic hill. Large variety of flowers and even a 1000 year old tree in the centre of the garden.Very calming environment and enjoyable place for a stroll with the family.Among the highlights are the cloud bridge , steps to heaven and the pond (another K drama filming location)."
Like a dream,"An absolutely beautiful garden situated slap bang in the middle of the mountains. You couldn't ask for a more idyllic place, chock full with areas of interest such as a bonsai garden, traditional Korean house, rope bridge, mini-waterfall and 1000 year old tree! A very romantic place for a date and super relaxing. The best garden I've visited whilst travelling."
Heaven on Earth 🌸,We were blown away by the natural beauty and serenity of this place. It was absolutely stunning and took our breath away!! It was fascinating to read the story behind a tree that is over 1000 years old. We were rejuvenated by the fresh air and beautiful scenery that met us around every bend. Well worth a visit. 
A calming garden,"I like flowers and this place is perfect for me. It's in the middle or peak of spring when I went there and all around me I can just see various types of blooming flowers. It is also one of the many filming spots for a Korean drama (I actually forgot its name) starring Song Ji Hyo. One unique thing about this garden that it has loudspeakers playing calming, soothing or in my own words, classical 'lo-fi' music which perfectly suits and blends with the garden. I felt I was like my own main character in my own film. If there were a hammock available to public use, I would lie down, resting my bodies and eyes and enjoy the garden scent together with its beautiful music."
Beautiful!,"It's a private garden. Well maintained. Beautiful scenery, beautiful flowers. Went there via tour agency - It's part of the tour that takes me to Nami Island and Little France"
lots of beautful flowers,"A pretty huge garden. It had lots of beautiful flowers, best visit it on Summer or Spring. I'll definitely visit it again."
Nice and Relaxing,"This place is a must go at least once in Korea. It is very beautiful, especially at night when all the lights are on. It can get a bit too cold in winter.."
Well thought out garden,"Went as part of a KKDay tour (a good deal). Pleasantly pleased, the garden was in full bloom with early summer blossoms. I understand that it is about 20 years old and therefore it mature. Well with the trip."
Relaxing and beautiful ,We had a nice time exploring the gardens. They are beautiful and well kept. There were plenty of flowers out and the grounds were looking beautifully green durung our visit on a hot summer day in June. I recommend good walking shoes and take a water bottle. 1.5 hours is how long it took us to wander around the whole garden.
Wonderful Landscape,The layout of the whole garden is nice! Flowers are pretty. Wonderful place to have family photo shooting.This is one the few nice garden which I visited overseas.Total hours spent about 3 hours
Very beautiful garden,"This is a very relaxing and satisfying place to visit with all the beautiful and colorful flowers that bloom all around this huge garden. The colors of the scenery are a feast to the eyes. There is also a huge, interesting juniper tree in the middle, and several interesting bonsai plants all around. For tourists who would rather not have a hard time commuting to go to this place, it may be best to join a group tour to see this, together with other sights, like Nami Island."
Beyond beautiful ,"I’ve been to many gardens and parks across the globe. And this one beat them all hands down. Everything was so artfully designed and arranged that it makes the whole place seem serene and tranquil. Walking thru Morning Calm makes you realise there are more important things in the world than work and play. Sometimes, you just have to take time to appreciate the beauty of nature around you. "
Amazing!!,"We went there in the beginning of Spring, still cold and we were able to to see the festival of lights. We took the bus tour, first we went to Nami Island then to The Garden of the Morning Calm. I love the lights, I'm totally glad that it was still open during our visit. Well recommend and a must see. Too bad I did not see the garden during the daylight, but there's probably not much flower to see in early Spring anyway."
really calm,"visited the garden of morning calm, wl never forget about the scenery and fresh air. consider to visit again this garden "
Very relaxing,"Our trip to garden of morning calm would have been perfect except we rode on the Gapyeong City bus tour from Nami Island and took 1.15hours and all of my family got dizzy because it was so fast and not to mention the winding road! Have I known about the winding road, we could have gone to Gapyeong Station and used the subway and stopped at Chyeongpyeong station and wait for the bus that goes to morning calm. Anyhow, the garden was very relaxing and they maintain it very well by making it off limits by some distance. We wished we could let the kids run around the garden with their barefoot but then we realized that this is not a park and we should respect how quiet and relaxing this place is. Tehee. Just look after your kids all the time as there are some spots that are a bit steep and they might fall. I highly recommend to use this mode of transportation if you want to visit garden of morning calm and Nami Island from the city. ( Take note: we were near city hall station so yongsan would be perfect for us)1.ITX Train (Yongsan - Cheongpyeong Station)2.Gapyeong City bus from Chyeongpyeong station to Garden of Morning Calm3. Gapyeong Bus to Cheongpyeong subway Station 4. Cheongpyeong subway Station to Gapyeong Station 5. Gapyeong City Bus to Nami Island 6. Nami Island - Gapyeong Station using gapyeong city bus 6. ITX Gapyeong Station to Yongsan (going back to Seoul) We did not bother to go to petite France as we want to explore the real South Korea. Tehee. And we did not book the shuttle (package) even though we have 3 young children as it was so early around 730 to go to your pick up point. And I heard the shuttle bus takes forever to reach Nami Island compared to itx train. (But this is just my opinion, if you prefer a hassle free tour, then go to shuttle bus) We just want to enjoy the place on our own time and not be conscious that you might be left behind by your group shuttle bus."
Beautiful Garden with an Abundance of Flowers!,The Garden of Morning Calm is accessible by public transit but is a little confusing as you must change transit lines. It is a lot cheaper than taking a package tour. The garden is full of flowers of all kinds and lovely landscapes. We visited in May and missed the cherry blossoms but the other flora were blooming everywhere. A lovely place to visit.
Just as beautiful as nami,I wish we couldve spent half a day here. Instagrammable spots in every corner. A lot of uphill climbing though. You can also buy flower seeds at the gift shop. 
Beautiful garden. Must do day trip from Seoul ,"I took a day trip from Seoul stopping at garden of morning calm, nami island and petite France. The garden took my breath away! I visited on 2 may and flowers were in full bloom. The landscape was beautiful too. It's a must visit .."
아침고요수목원,"Amazing place to visit! Beautiful flowers are everywhere, fresh air ...etc. Must visit place. I highly recommend this place. Famous place known for Korean TV dramas, too. Jamsil station, 7000 went to Gapyung station, and then transfer to the local bus. It took about 2 and half hours to go to '아침고요수목원.' But it is totally worth.Opens 8:30-19:00. There is also a zoo right next to the garden. To come back home, since we took the last bus, which was at 20:00pm, we had to take the subway from Changpyung station to Jamsil. It took about two hours and half. Even though it took 5 hours on the road, it was really worh to visit there, since there were lots of things to watch and enjoy the beauty of nature. Thanks to my friend, who has introduced this place. Entrance fee: Around 10,000 won per person. There were many stores, such as coffee&bakery shop, gift shop, Korean restaurant, vendors... etc.꼭 방문하시길 추천합니다! 너무 아름다운 곳 입니다. 5월이라 날씨도 맑고 화창하고 미세먼지 없는날인 주중에 잘 다녀왔습니다."
Good flower garden,"This is a nice private garden and one of two most popular tourist sites in Gapyeong-gun. A great picnic area in a sunny day. Also good for the illumination in the evening.- When it's crowded, it takes quite a long time near the parking lot. The bus was crawling for 20~30 min.- Even though it's crowded, the garden is huge enough to get relaxed.- The entrance fee is a bit high for the flower garden. But, it's not much for the effort and the time to come here.- There are a number of different flowers and plants. Fun to see. There's a shop selling them with affordable prices.- I recommend 2~3 day trip to Gapyeong-gun staying there because it's 1~2 hour run from Seoul and buses don't come often within the city. Some of tourist sites are better in the early morning or in the evening.- There's The Zoo of Morning Calm nearby. Visitors with children will head to there if they have some more time."
Pretty scenery and flowers,"Went in early May and the flowers were so pretty!! The scenery was so beautiful and the place has this really peaceful vibe and lives up to its name of being a ""calming"" place. Recommend everyone to visit this place when in Seoul. A good 1.5 hour should be more than sufficient to explore most parts of the garden."
Wonderful view,"To all those who wants to visit this place: Keep in mind that this place is huge, so be prepared to do a lot of walking - especially up hill.But, if you are prepared to walk, then come visit this place. I visited it during winter a few years ago and it was wonderful. The place was covered in snow and there were lights everywhere. Now that I visited it during spring, it was more beautiful as the flowers were blooming. It was a splash of color. Definitely worth a visit."
A Huge Place to Walk Through,"1st time to visit this place. A very huge garden with sub gardens of different classes. There’s a lot of walking to do. I suggest you start early to finish early. The place gets crowded as the day goes by. What I love most is the tulip garden. So many beautiful tulips in different colors and they are all in bloom. There’s a suspension or hanging bridge to go through another area. The air is cool, there are still cherry blossoms, plants and trees everywhere, ponds, streams, mini waterfalls. Very pleasing to the eyes. With regards to food, there’s only one restaurant and a couple of small stores. Actually most visitors had food with them and there are dining areas.We took the ITX then taxi from the station. Would recommend this attraction to others."
Beautiful garden ,"The garden is beautiful in spring. Colorful flowers were in bloom. A must visit in Seoul. We spend about two hours here walking around the garden, breathing in the fresh air. "
Nice Garden in Winter but Avoid Early April,"I visited the Garden of Morning Calm twice - once in Winter in December and once early April (5 April 2019). The winter views were nice because of the lights and so it is advisable to go late evening to night. However, they remove the lights after 31 March and replant the flowering plants in the first week of April. When I went there in early April, all the trees were bare. The cherry blossom trees have not flowered and the gardeners were just starting to replant fresh flowering plants. So, it was quite disappointing. However, there was no crowd at all and so we could walk around the place leisurely, enjoy the fresh air and watch the ladies plant plants. Therefore, it is best to check out if the place is ready and in bloom before making the trip there to avoid disappointment."
amazing and peacefull,"the air is very refreshing,a lot of tree and flowers with beautiful colour. also have a history place. a must visit if u already come to nami island. this is the last pit stop before back to train station. not sure the website which u can google to get discount coupon online."
Must-go garden in Korea,the view was spectacular will the surrounding mountains in the frame. but we went at the wrong timing as the trees are still leafless even though it is already the end of March.
The later the better!,"We regrettably started the morning late so ended up late at Garden of Morning Calm which became a blessing in disguise as it was less crowded as all the tour groups were leaving as we entered the park.It is comparable to similar night illumination parks in Japan, be perhaps in Japan there was more animation so it was a bit more interesting. Regardless, i still enjoyed the various themes in the different areas of the park. Would not recommend coming all this way just for this, but if you want to visit Nami Island/ petite france etc then it is a nice ending to your day trip.As mentioned, photo spots are crowded so the lesser people the better, therefore go later. Best to self drive as the last bus leaves quite early. We paid a fixed 6000 won for adult, 4000won for child; which brought us from Gapyeong station to Nami Island and then Nami to Garden of Morning Calm. It is a 1 hour bus ride from Nami Island so either eat first or bring snacks along the way!During the light festival it closes at 9pm, but the last bus leaves at 8.30pm so if you drive you can enjoy a little longer. 1 hour should be a enough time to enjoy all the areas of the park (depending on how cold and do well dressed you are) but easily 2 hours if you like to take pictures etc.There are snacks outside the park, and luggage lockers if you need to leave your backpacks etc. Would come back in Summer next time :)"
Interesting but not spectacular.,"We went in the evening to see the lighting. It was surprisingly crowded on a weekday. The lights were dazzling when we first entered but very quickly it became boring. Go if you have half a day free, or with children or friends who love to take selfie. But you will have to fight with countless people taking the perfect selfie."
Day Trip from Seoul in Autumn,"Vast and beautiful garden with varieties of flowers and plants in different cultural settings blended well with the natural terrain of hill slope, plains, ponds, bridges and traditional architecture. Even during wet day we enjoyed the tasteful design and natural feel of the Morning Calm. We would be keen to visit again, probably for the evening light up in future."
Would definitely come back,"I was traveling with parents, aunts, and grandparents. I know that this kind of attraction is something they’d enjoy. We came with a very low expectation as this place was really far away from the port, but this should be a better choice over petit France.Hell yeah it was awesome. We didn’t have this kind of garden back in Indonesia so this was very beautiful for us. Everyone in my family liked it, and I did as well. They provide wheelchair rental and pathways were ok for it. However, you’ll give up going too far due to inclination as it would be difficult to push the wheelchair. The souvenir store was also great, I liked the botanical product they sell over there."
Exceeded Expectations,"We visited during winter and we were pleasantly surprised with what the Garden of Morning Calm has to offer. The beautiful light displays were really a feast for the eyes, and all the colors illuminating the garden make the experience truly magical. Each part of the garden has a different theme and every spot was picture-perfect so make sure your phone or camera is fully charged (or bring a powerbank!). It can get freezing cold though so be prepared and wear warm clothing."
Awesome Garden,Its a beautiful garden. we go there in the winter and the festival of lights is amazing during at night where some of the places are decorated with different lights. There is also a hanging bridge where you can walk and took some beautiful pictures and videos as well. There's a souvenir shops and food stall near the main entrance. and it is also famous for some koreans movie location too. There are thousands of species of different plants and flowers but since its winter when we go there we are not able to see those beautiful flowers and plants. i suggest you go there in summer.
a happy place,"i booked a tour in Klook that includes Garden of Morning Calm, Nami Island, and Petit France. Our first stop was the Garden of Morning Calm. The garden is famous because it is one of the shooting places of the K-drama Love in the Moonlight.The garden is a big place so you can either stay there for at least half day. Also, wear a comfortable walking shoes. Since I was booked in a tour i don't have enough time to explore the whole place. What i like about this attraction are the flowers. My trip was during the second week of May and it's very timely because the flowers are in full bloom. Also, it's a peaceful place and good for relaxation (except for that you have to walk)"
Beautiful lights during winter,"I booked a tour through Klook to visit Nami Island and the Garden of Morning Calm. During winter, there's a beautiful lights display at the Garden of Morning Calm. The garden was very beautiful. Make sure your camera has a good night mode. The garden is also much colder than Nami Island and Seoul - my phone's battery went form 50% to 1% and shut down."
Amazing winter lights!,This garden in winter becomes a blaze of beautiful coloured lights. The garden is sectioned off in different themes with a few long passageways totally covered in lights. You will be amazed!! It will take you a few hours to walk the whole gardens and there are so many great photo opportunities to take. It is a must to see in winter!
Inspired by Sri Rabindranath Tagore,"Inspired by the poem of one of India’s greatest poet Sri Rabindranath Tagore, in which he had described Korea as “The Land of the Morning Calm"", this attraction is a collection of around 13 unique gardens.It takes around 1.5-2 hours to reach from Seoul in the morning, but take a little more during the closing time, visit here if you want to loose yourself in this huge garden.One of the best maintained garden in Seoul, this place also boosts of being the preferred location for many shooting many successful films.The best time to visit is during spring.This place also has a plant shop in addition to convenience stores, Gift Shops, restaurants, coffee shops."
Nice walk ,"Nice walk, we where there in the middle of autumn and hust few days short before the snow it was very cold but a nice stroll. I hist wish that the tour could give us more time to explore the area. I guess it is best to visit at first week of november or early December."
Winter Wonderland,"Visited in late November. The garden was covered in a snow blanket, giving it a different feel during winter. Numerous photo op! Glad to have made it to the small church (which was quite a walk), and mildly surprised that there were pewters and you could actually pray inside."
Magical Moment ...,"Looking forward to this place before visiting Seoul. The name itself is lovely, imagine stroll in this garden in spring or autumn in the morning with flowers or autumn foilage all around will feel so calm & delightful!Went on 7 Dec to see the lights up, our 3rd stop after nami & petitie france with Gapyeong shuttle bus ticket. From Petite France to Garden is about 45 min ride.It's was like -7 freezing cold to take photo but the joys of seeing these beautiful lights keep us moving! Guess we didn't finish seeing all as time is limited need to catch bus & ITX train back to Seoul.Bot lots of great products from the garden shop, do check out. How I wish we came before sunset & see the surrounding before it gets dark & then see the lights up would be wonderful... will revisit again for other seasons!"
Looking for peace and serenity? Visit this place,"One of my highlights in my South Korea travel last October 2018 is this place. The garden is beautifully landscaped and is filled with colorful trees and plants. Upon entering, you will hear an instrumental music that will soothe your soul. The scenery is pleasing to the eyes. It is like being one with nature. It is a must visit specially in autumn season because of the foliage."
"30,000 sparkling lights!","We took a bus trip to see the Light Festival at the Garden of the Morning Calm.There are various themes throughout the park. Our favorite was the little white church and hanging lights that reminded us of the Tree of Souls from Avatar. The restrooms have small (but effective!) floor heaters so it was a nice escape from the cold. There are 3 or 4 food stalls just outside the entrance: quick bites, coffee, hot chocolate, hand warmers. Gift shop OUTSIDE the entrance selling hats, ear warmers, soaps, loose tea, oils. Small restaurant inside close to the swinging bridge with a decent selection. There was a little store close to this area selling warm coffee in cans and other drinks. Good Morning Cafe was closed when we were there but appears to serve waffles. (We were there after 5pm on a Sat) 1-2 miles prior to the garden is lined with restuarants. Not walkable (in my opinion) from the garden.Entrance fee is cheaper during the week.Free parking.Stroller friendly.Also in this area... Nami Island and Le Petite France.432, Sumogwon-ro, Gapyeong-gun, Gyeonggi-do경기도 가평군 상면 수목원로 432 (상면)Runs annually from beginning of Dec to end of March."
Beautiful!,Best time to visit is autumn as the color combination of flowers and the landscape are colorful and truly a sight to see. Every corner is photo spot.
No autumn flowers,"This is a beautiful man-made garden, unfortunately the autumn foliage had all but disappeared in mid November. And the stunning pictures you see on brochures non existent. There was a very good chrysanthenum display near the entrance, and the garden itself is very peaceful and pleasant for a stroll. But then, you must balance that with the 1 hour journey time from gapyeong each way and decide if it's worth your while."
Very Earthy and indeed it’s calming!,"Went to Seoul for the second time this year on early autumn. One of the best scenic Kdrama locations and I must say, it’s indeed overwhelming. The color combination of flowers, the landscapes are truly paradise. Every corner is a spot. You will enjoy to stay here and ponder if you want, the name suit this place. Take as many photos as you like, I like being with nature so this is a plus for me. There’s restaurant inside but they open only on lunch I think. I didn’t try because we went here around 5pm. I suggest you rent a car as we did, because this place is way too far from Seoul city. Though riding a bus will do, but it can cause you a hassle, since this place close at 6pm on weekdays, this place also is quite isolated from public transportation and cabs. Or stay in nearby hotel so you can visit alpaca pasture that it’s just 10 minutes away with car. I suggest joining a tour, if you plan to go to nami and petite France. You can visit them in one day, just like we did but we want to be comfortable as possible. Those three tourist spots I mentioned are very far from each other. But visiting them are worth the time and effort. I like this place way better than nami island. This place is instagram worthy I promise you that! "
First visit,"Bought one day trip to Nami & here during end November .. most leaves withered, the staff busy setting up Christmas lighting in the garden . Worth visit for a time"
Great scene with maple leaves,"I traveled this garden on 7 November 2018. It took me more than 1 hours of drive from Seoul. The scene was beautiful with lots of maple leaves. Although weather was rainy and a bit cold, it created a strong feeling of Autumn."
Autumn... don’t expect too much.,"Friend took us here... not my scene, but, made the most of it.It’s autumn, trees were/lost their leaves... some flower beds of nicely arranged colorful displays, with cabbage flowers to the fore... pity the season limited the flower displays!The hi- lite was the swing bridge ...there were flower displays along hilly pathways, interspersed with trees, shrubs etc, liken to any garden... this is Seoul... a garden is a luxury... therefore, a large number of visitors, local and tourists by the bus - loads ( yeah... unlike me! )flock to look see.Wanna see some flowers, etc, it’s worth a visit ( ie, if you are an apartment dweller)To me, ( my perspective is biased ) It is not my scene! Others may beg to differ!Time spent here is dependent upon the individual/ family..."
Top marks for autumn scenery,"Autumn transforms the garden into a fascinating place, as the trees turn into various colors. The garden is very well kept hence it is easy to walk around. Best time to go there is indeed the morning time; there is a mystic atmosphere of calmness. I had visited the garden several times (all in the morning but most of the time there was a drizzle). This was my visit in autumn. Drizzling again."
The Garden of Morning Calm South Korea,"Went here October 23, 2018. Great time for autumn season. The autumn leaves are blooming in their vibrant red, yellow and orange colors. Lots of areas to take great photos with nature. Since we came here on a tour, time was not enough to cover the whole area. I'm sure there are still lots of areas to discover in this beautiful garden. Definitely worth the trip to this picturesque place."
Very peaceful place,We joined a one-day tour and went to The Garden of Morning Calm in the afternoon. It was a very peaceful place with lots of flowers. The scenary was stunning especially with all those red maple trees. It's not only good in Autumn I believe.
Beautiful Garden,"Beautiful garden in autumn. However it is sad to see tourists who enter flower zones which are prohibited and step on grasses that clearly has a sign ""DO NOT ENTER"" to take photos. They destroyed the beautiful flowers and many just follow suit. Sad to see the plants to be stepped on and became flat on ground. "
Autumn,"It was a beautiful autumn morning on Oct 30, 2018 when we went to the Garden of Morning Calm. Crisp cool air, blue skies, red maple trees, fantastic chrysanthemum exhibit. My sisters and I enjoyed the visit. Nature at its best! "
Beautiful Morning,"We went to the Garden of Morning Calm on Oct 30, 2018. It was a beautiful autumn morning. Crisp cool air, blue skies, red maple trees, fantastic chrysanthemum exhibit. My sisters and I enjoyed the visit. Nature at its best!"
Garden of Morning Calm-Korea,"We were originally planning to visit another tourist area in Korea, however, we were advised to visit the Garden of the morning calm instead.It was raining the morning we went. When it stopped, we were able to go around the garden and we were amazed at the beautiful blooms and trees surrounding the area.It can uplift tired and weary minds just looking at the garden.We are very glad that we listened to the advice given us. The place is highly recommended when traveling to Korea."
"Garden of the Morning Calm, Gap-pyeong","Incredibly beautiful, well thought, well designed garden. I wish we had the whole day to look around, relax and enjoy the sceneries."
Celebrating Mom's birthday,"We decided to celebrate Mom's birthday in Korea and on our 3rd day in Korea, we visited the Garden of the Morning Calm. It was raining when we arrived at the garden, luckily, our tour guide from Here Korea, Michael Son, was always ready as he has 4 umbrellas in his van. Our dampened spirit suddenly lighted up when we were at the garden's entrance as the garden was astonishingly beautiful with all the different kinds of flowers and trees perfectly laid out bursting with vibrant autumn colours. Highly recommended to visit."
Autumn in Korea,"It was such an awesome experience celebrating my mom's 80th birthday today surrounded by the beautifully designed garden bursting with the amazing colors of autumn. This was made possible by the perfect and timely suggestion of our tour guide, Michael, from Here Korea. We will definitely come back for another magnificent Spring in Korea! Thanks, Michael & Here Korea!"
An amazing autumn experience!,"The Garden of the morning calm is a fantastic place for seeing autumn foliage. We were fortunate to have visited at a very good time, when most of the trees are at its peak autumn color. All of us in the family, even my 80-yr old grandmother, really enjoyed walking and taking pictures around the garden. It is a very large place, with several areas to visit. We weren't able to see all of them, and it would probably take half a day to see the whole place at a relaxed pace. Would definitely recommend to everyone visiting Gapyeong, or as a side trip before visiting Nami Island! "
A must see in Seoul.,"The place lives up to its name. Any time of day feels like a morning calm. The landscspe of beautiful trees and flowering plants make you feel calm and yet envigorated. The mass of colorful flowers are truly amazing. Even if flowering plants were just transplanted and arranged on the ground instantly, the sheer expanse and play colors is just too beautiful to even think of the shortcuts they made."
A memorable trip to garden of Nami,According to history Nami Island years ago declared its cultural independence and became Naminara Republic. It was named after General Nami.This place is really romantic and nature exist. A peaceful and you can relax with the sound wind. I love this place really can recommended to my friends to visit it.
nature!,This is a very nice garden to visit. It has a serene natural feel to it and everything is just nicely taken care of.
Best way to start the morning,Loved this garden. Got to have the best 5 fruit Tea in the Korean Tea house. The view was breathtaking and relaxing!
Beautiful landscapes,"It is about an hour and a half away from the city. We took a tour to get here. The garden is very relaxing and calming. There were a lot of beautiful trees, flowers, and scenery in general. It is nice to sit down with a friend, enjoy the view and have a pleasant chat. "
Piece of heaven on earth!,"So this place is really a slice of heaven on earth. The views are breathtaking, and the place so soothing for the soul. Prepare to spend at least half a day here, if not more, to do justice to your trip. There are paved and non paved trails if you love walking or hiking and the views are spectacular. Some small bits of steep sections but you can always take a break and then continue. Lots and lots of insta worthy picture opportunities. I would recommend this place to every Seoul visitor. "
Beautiful Garden with Peaceful Music,"Who would have thought that it would be perfect to play music in gardens and I mean the whole garden with speakers attached to lamp posts! This Morning Calm Garden is quite an exercise and if you want to exploreee the whole garden then it may take you more than an hour. That said, the garden placement really is amazing though. Do get the map, it's really useful so you can plan your route for example we didn't go to all the stops, we started with the bridge and to the juniper and a few more down south then finally to the ""Heaven"" and returned to the entrance downhill.We paid about $8,000-10,000 and only went to the Garden and Nami Island. Skipped Petite France cause we were short on time. Also note that the restaurant there is surprisingly pretty good! I had the spicy cheese rice cakes!"
So pretty,"We went to the Garden of Morning Calm as part of a trip to Nami Island and Petite France as well. This Garden was definitely the highlight of our day, the views were beautiful. It was very relaxing to take a walk around although there are many great photo opportunities as well."
Beautiful ,"If you love flowers and plants, this is the place you might want to consider if you are visiting Nami Island or Petite France. It has also been the filming site for dramas.This place will show its splendour according to seasons. I walked on the 'Best Course'. Pretty nice. Halfway through, after 'Pond Garden', i settled at a Tea House for iced Omija Tea and Korean rice cake, seated next to the window giving the mountain scenery.To get here:1. Get to Gapyeong Train Station2. Hop on the Gapyeong/Nami Tour Bus just outside the station. Cash payment of 6000KRW.3. Check if the place is on the route. Some drivers might take another route. And the bus stop is also serving the Rail Bike Shuttle.4. Entrance to the garden costs 9500KRW for adults."
Spectacular and breathtaking landscaping ,If you love nature and well kept landscaping with colorful flowers then this is the place you should see. You are in tuned with nature and feel the harmony with a positive chi. It’s very relaxing to walk around the garden. 
Heavenly Garden,"If you want to see the natural beauty of Korea in one place, it’s the Garden of Morning Calm! Every square meter of this place is purely amazing! It’s a great place to relax, meditate and enjoy nature. Each season offers a distinct character to the place. "
"Pretty and calming garden, visit as part of tour","We visited this place as part of a tour because getting here via public transport is too much of a hassle and the tour came with 2 additional places to visit and I must say the place is totally worth it, only if you're visiting as part of a tour.We visited during summer and the garden is really pretty and quite well maintained. I imagine it to be a lot more beautiful during spring and summer, but it was pretty enough. Like the name suggest, it was quite a calming experience exploring the different sections of the garden with different themes to it. The mountains nearby also adds to the entire experience.Aside from the garden though, there's not many other things nearby for tourists to do. There are small snack shops at the entrance but not enough for a full meal, so I don't suggest coming here for meals. You also need to pay an entrance fee to enter the place. Ours was covered as part of the tour cost, which was at around 75,000 won for 3 places worth.We spent about one to two hours at this place, which gave us a ton of beautiful photos. I recommend this place if you're an outdoor person, but I strongly suggest getting a tour to come this place because travelling to this garden on your own is quite troublesome and not worth it."
Experience natural beauty of Korea,"We went there during summer and it was scorching, but seeing the variety of plants, trees, and flowers can still be calming. The park is quite big so allot 2-3 hours to truly enjoy all the spots."
Beautiful sights- an absolute must-see!,"I absolutely loved here even though I did not really know what to expect, as the tour did not give us much in-depth information about the place or what we would be doing there. We booked it because of the pictures of the views and were mesmerized. All I can say is you need to visit there to believe it. It was so relaxing, calm, magical and beautiful there. I instantly felt at peace walking around the gardens, walkways and the little English house is a must-see whilst you are there. We were honestly so impressed. When I got home I sent my family pictures as presents and they were just amazed by them. There was a little gift shop selling beautiful perfumes etc but we did not really have enough time to look round, but I would recommend leaving 30 minutes at the end of your visit to do so."
"Amazing garden, a must see",A botanical garden not far from Nami Island. Thi garden was very calm and has different themes in every area. The flowers were in bloom and taken care of. The plants look so healthy. It was really nice to explore the whole garden. Take time to roam around the area. You'll be able to discover amazing views along the way.
Garden of Morning Calm,"Being a person who loves flowers get me excited because I get to see all different types of gardens and flowrrs. Refreshes the mind and makes you want to stay all day. Best to come during spring or fall, when the flowers bloom or when the leaves fall. Be careful during rainy days because it might get slippery. Services such as cafes and toilets are also available. Many spots are able for photo takings as well."
a calm and cool garden,the morning calm garden is not a famous place among tourist and make it a better place to visit compare nami island. i went there during autumn and the garden give the best view with colours and some flower even already pass spring season. even the garden in not big but it is a nice place to visit. really reccommended.
Alot of different type of flower and plant,"Plant and flower must come, will be even nicer if come during none summer period, otherwise you need to wear a hat or cap or umbrella, otherwise you will be toasted by the hot SUN"
Beautiful,Beautiful garden. Fresh flowers. Relaxing place. Recommended for everyone. very beautiful at night very cool and enjoy!
Breathtakingly Beautiful ,"We went in the summer on a Thursday and it was so peaceful and quiet. There were no crowds so you could really enjoy beautiful landscapes in the park. The park had a few must see areas so grab a map at the entrance. Also before going check to see if they have any special exhibits goibg on. During July we were able to catch the hydrangeas exhibits. It was reallt beautiful. There are also lots of shops to look at but do note they close around 6pm. We entered the park at 5 so when we were done the shops were closed. Also note that the park is HUGE so be prepared to walk. All in all I would highly recommend this place for people who love nature and plants. :) If you are unsure if there is food, there are shops before entering so I recommend eating before or after. Enjoy! "
I loved every single bit of this place!!!,"We did this place in combination with Nami Island and Petite France and I must say we weren’t disappointed. The garden was phenomenal. We strolled lightly hand in hand, sat on the benches and enjoyed the view as we listened to the flowing of the river. They have a few green houses that are worth the visit and the garden in the middle is where they film a few Korean soap opera it was breath taking. I would revisit here. There are a few coffee/ tea shops inside as well. This is great for a family or couples excursion( pictures, picnic, date)"
Awesome garden,Awesome garden. Fresh flowers. Relaxing place. Recommended for everyone. A lot of food options outside the garden. Green thumb peeps will surely enjoy here.
Hydrangea,"The Garden of Morning Calm is a must visit to all family members. The garden is 30,000㎡ in size and it, is open year- round. The garden has 28 themed sub-gardens. There is a 50 meters wooden bridge to transfer you to the heart of the garden. The garden is utter beauty and 2 hours visit is not enough. There was a special summer time flower exhibition of Hydrangea. Hydrangeas are large, showy flower clusters of white, pink, or blue. I would suppose nature photographers would be happy in this heaven with the garden’s scenic walkways and beautifully manicured grass. By the way, pets are not permitted. There are a variety of festivals and displays held throughout the year. * Spring: Spring Garden Festival * Summer: Festival of Roses, Hydrangeas and Roses of Sharon * Autumn: Festival of Chrysanthemums and Autumnal Tints * Winter: Lighting FestivalSEE photos."
Would stay here the whole day if I could,absolutely beautiful place! the garden is so huge it will not be hard to find quiet spot to just sit with a cup of coffee and just drink in nature. Especially enjoyed the exhibit they had of different species (kinds?) of forget me nots they had at the time of our visit. Will see if I can post some pictures later. Will most definitely recommend a visit to this beautiful oasis to garden enthusiasts.
beautiful!,the place is huge... filled with flowers and trees we went during summer and the flowers were all blooming they have coffee shops and bakery also small food stalls in the place where you can relax and unwind.. try to alot around 2 to 3 hours so you can walk around with out rushing..
Beautiful,The 3 hour train trip and then 30 minute bus trip was well worth it to witness in person this beautiful garden. So serene and quiet and so colorful. The garden is massive and surrounded by the mountains of thick lush trees. Absolutely wonderful. 
A Beautiful and Peaceful Garden,"It was convenient getting to the Garden of Morning Calm - the last stop on the route taken by the Shuttle Bus for Gapyeong Tourist Resort. The Shuttle Bus starts from Gapyeong Station and drops by popular attractions like Nami Island and Petite France. It costs 6000KRW for an adult ticket and one can board and alight as many times as required in one day. The Garden of Morning Calm was our last stop on a day trip to Gapyeong. Although it was Summer (the Garden is prettier during other seasons), the Garden was still very beautiful and charming. Walking along the various trails with soft music in the background was peaceful and relaxing. There were signs throughout the Garden introducing the various flowers. We caught the Hydrangea Exhibition which was just lovely. Before we left, we stopped by the Herb Shop where products sold are apparently produced in-house. All in all, we had an enjoyable time here."
Beautiful and peaceful garden,"A lovely outing to the garden. Very pretty and calm to its name. It was bright and sunny on the day we went, so we took lots of photos. Worth going."
Stunningly beautiful ,"This garden is really beautiful. We spent about 2-3 hours walking around and resting at the hanok within the garden. You gotta visit this place as no words can describe how beautiful it is. Every part of the garden is of different themes. And at different time of the year, they will hold exhibitions of different flowers. There is a cafe and a restaurant within the garden should you decide to visit around lunch time. There are also snack joints at the entrance of the park. Parking is free and the carpark is located right before the entrance of the garden."
Beautiful and relaxing garden,"Did not honestly expect a lot from the garden as it was my last stop and I had a rather tired and grouchy rest on the bus. But once I entered, I was immediately refreshed and rejuvenated. Beautiful nature with colourful flowers, breezy weather although summer time in the evening and the water flowing from streams. There is a good morning cafe not far off from the entrance with a really picturesque view! Easy and light stroll and totally recommended! "
best ever,"The most beautiful garden I have visited anywhere in the world. I was lucky with the weather and despite it being a weekend and crowded with locals, due to the size it was still possible to find peaceful spots and take amazing photographs. A few hours are needed to fully cover this wonderful place and an excellent map and good signposting make it a real delight."
The name speaks for itself!,"This is a place where you can relax and meditate - the garden is full of foliage, flowers, trees and other flora unique to South Korea. The id a souvenir shop right at the entrance and also a mini museum. "
Beautiful! A real delight for garden lovers!,"I joined a tour group for this trip, and Garden of Morning Calm was our first stop. It is about a 90 minute drive from Seoul, but a world away! The gardens are stunning and full of beautiful plants and flowers. Anyone who enjoys botanical gardens will enjoy this tour. It is not a huge place - we spent about 90 minutes there. There is a tea house and gift shop, as well, that I did not stop in. We went from here to Nami Island, so would definitely recommend coupling this trip with another event to make a full day of it."
A beautiful garden and calming indeed!,We visited the garden in Spring and in the morning. Unfortunately it was a rainy day which was very rare as the guide shared. The rain came and went a few times so it really affected the otherwise lovely experience of strolling and taking photos of the beautiful flowers. They looked drenched especially the trumpet flowers. Haha. The small white church looked good in the photos. The tulips were filled with water droplets for a different effect. Overall it was worth at least a 2 hours leisurely stroll in this garden to calm our busy city souls. Hope to visit in autumn again on a sunny day! Wish you'll have better weather! 
Beautiful during winter,"Took a tour up here, where we also visited petite calm and Nami Island during Winter, and it was snowing heavily but the Christmas lights were gorgeous. Would recommend this for couples and families. During winter it snows very heavily here up in the mountains so I wouldn't recommend driving up yourself unless you have experience driving in heavy snow. We came with a bus tour and luckily despite the heavy snowfall, we managed to get in and out before we got snowed in!"
Amazing sighting ,"It is not close to Seoul, but if you have a lot of time to spare, you can go and visit this place full with beautiful colors, different type of trees, bushes and flowers. Be prepared to find the right spot to snap a nice pic, for sure you will share it with friends and family"
Beautiful tulips,"This was my second visit. Both visits were in the mornings (around 9 am). Again I looked for the beautiful tulips; they still had the dew drops on before 10 am. Soon afterwards the sun would dry the dew drops up. Although the garden is big, visitors usually go to just a few spots eg the pond, the ""church"", etc."
Worth the money,Visited the garden after winter and got to see the lights. The place was surrounded and designed by various lights and it is so beautiful.
beautiful and colorful,"We went there by a local tour on 30 April. It was the first stop of our one day tour. We arrived early in the morning after 1.5hrs drive from Seoul. Not many visitors were there when we arrived. The garden was so peaceful, very beautiful with lots of colorful flowers and trees. We could spend only 1.5 hours there as there were two more stops to visit. It was a bit too short to explore all its beautiful landscape in 90 mins. The whole garden was very well-maintained, and we would suggest to spend at least two hours there. It is a must-see tourist spot from Seoul."
Beautiful Lights,"This was the last stop of a Nami Island day tour. Wasn't sure what to expect when I heard about it but it was actually a lot better than I thought it would be. The gardens are huge and when we were there they had set up lights over the whole garden. Beautiful displays which had so much variety. It was really nice to just walk around the park and look at everything. However, we did not get a lot of time here so we didn't get to see everything like the pagoda over the pond which was supposed to be from a drama series.There was also a museum by the entrance but it was all on Korean. The souvenir shop was decently sized and had plenty of interesting products which looked like it was locally made.Really nice stop. The only thing was that there weren't many food options available so just had something at the stalls near the carpark."
A place to zen,"It is a mesmerizing garden with full bloom of flowers accompanied by cooling breeze. My friend and I spent a good 2 hours strolling around this beautiful garden admiring the flowers, trees and streams. A very serene place to take a break and relax. I strongly recommend travelers to visit this garden if you visit Gapyeong or Chuncheon."
Flowers in bloom,Even with rain the garden captivated us with its beautiful flowers and landscape. Tulips in different colors were all around. Admired the preservation of millineum juniper. Surrounded by mountain that adds beauty to the garden.
Wish We Had More Time,"We visited The Garden of Morning Calm after Petit France and Nami. Thus, you can imagine that we were tired but we were glad to have pushed through with it. It was the start of Cherry Blossoms but rained a lot during the week with lots of wind. Thus, it was very cold and couldn’t really go around extensively. But it was definitely worth our while - and wished we devoted more time for it. Refreshing gardens of different themes, not crowded and the coffee shopped helped warm us a bit."
Garden of Morning Calm,Our visit to Morning Calm was awesome. There were many picturesque viewpoints to see. We especially liked all the flowers in bloom as well as the beautiful lake. We had a good experience.
Sparkling Night!,"We went here at NIGHT, it's a must visit at night I suppose since everything is lighted, just too bad since everything is dark as well aside with their lights so your phone camera won't get you that perfect shot. It was huge! I think two hours were not enough for me to visit the entire place."
Lovely Gardens,"Visited the gardens in early April. Despite it being Spring, it snowed the night before we visited the gardens. The snow on the trees, made me feel like it was Christmas in April.Not too sure about other seasons, but it is a must visit place come Spring/Autumn"
Lovely spring day,"We visited here just as all the tulips were in bloom, which made it very pretty. If you are part of a tour I would highly recommend quickly getting to the pond at the back first, then walking back to the entrance. That way you get the most beautiful parts of the garden to yourself before others arrive.We spent a leisurely 2 hours here but garden lovers could easily spend more."
Gorgeous Oriental Garden ,"It was unfortunately a cold, rainy day in spring when we visited. But it was still an enjoyable trip, the scenery was terrific. Highly recommend! "
Spring and Autumn only,We went here on March where the end of winter and arriving for Spring. Most of the trees have no leaves and flowers were not yet bloom. The staff are starting to remove some decorations from their winter season and starting to change for spring. I think the garden would be great if you come on flower season or autumn.
should open for a particular season only..,"i went on 28th march, and it was full with barren trees without any leaves..nothing to see actually.."
Feel so cheated as there was NO flowers at all,"We were there on the 27Mar, just 2 days after their festival of lights ended.Messy with lights wiring lying on the floor as the staff were busy removing them. There was nothing to see, no flowers as seen, only dried branches. They should have informed tourists about the changing in season at their website or at entrance as we were extremely disappointed upon entering!You can skip this place! A total waste of time!It apparently became a famous tourist spot after the filming of one Korean Drama but when flowers were in season! "
Don’t come in March,"From the photos, this place looks like it would be really beautiful at other times of the year. However, in March it’s not really worth it. There is no snow, but no leaves on the trees yet and barely a flower to be seen, leaving the place looking very barren and disappointing. They were dissembling the winter light show, adding to the feel that this was an awkward, between seasons time to visit. The parts we did still enjoy were the greenhouse and the flower house which were beautiful. Also they were starting to plant out their tulips and they were also lovely. In short, come at a different time of year to us!"
Wintry Illuminated Spectacle,"This was the second and last stop in our Gapyeong day excursion. We took the Gapyeong City Tour Bus (cost KRW6000 for adults and KRW4000 for children and seniors) which cost us KRW2500 per person as we had a discount coupon from the Korea Tourism Organisation. It took us about an hour ride on the bus from Nami Island. As it was Winter, the garden was illuminated with thousands and thousands of LED lights. We initially planned to reach the garden just before sunset. However, we left our previous stop, Nami Island, a little late. Thus, I would recommend that you leave for the garden early from your previous Gapyeong attraction. The garden is indeed true to its name. The walk was pleasant though was extremely cold on the day of our visit. The entire garden was filled with calming music. There are different areas with different themes. This garden is one of my favourite attraction on this trip."
Relive Love in the Moonlight Moments,"The last stop for this tour is the emerging tourist destination in South Korea, the Garden of Morning Calm. We arrive in the place at around 5:30PM, it was very cold and starting to get dark. Visiting this place at night is a highly recommended so everyone can see the beautifully lighted landscapes. However, I think it is also good to visit this place at day time to have another view of the place, most especially if you are a K-Drama or Park Bo Gum fan. This place boast of being one of the filming location of the phenomenal Love in the Moonlight. My photos in the bridge and in the garden where some scenes were shot are not clear because we were there at nigh time. I hope to visit this place again at noon time."
Recommended. Must come here,It is the same route with Nami island so if you go to Nami island you have to come here too. The place is spectacular. Come before sunset until night. You will find two different view.
Hypnotizing!,"True to its name, The Garden of Morning Calm slowly leads you into a state of serene hypnosis. It easily became one of my favorite tourist attractions.It is also the shooting location of various movies and drama series. The palace pond in ""Love in the Moonlight"" (Moonlight Drawn by Clouds) was filmed here.The garden is divided into areas with different themes, all connected by panoramic walkways. Every area was picture-perfect!I arrived in the garden with a restless spirit but left with a tank full of peace… and the desire to have more of it.3 TIPS WHEN VISITING:1. Go in the late afternoon, just before sunset, so that you can enjoy both views - daylight and nighttime.2. During winter - do not miss the Lighting Festival - the biggest lighting fest in Korea.3. Expect to walk a lot, bring water and some snacks."
Not that fantastic,"Join a tour group and reached there about 7pm. It was winter season and they have the light festive. The lighting was nice but it doesn't have the ""wow"" factor. Also, because it was already dark when we reached there, there was basically nothing to see besides the lighting. The natural beauty of the garden wasn't displayed. Maybe it will be nicer in the morning. It was not a very big garden, probably can finish walking in less than an hour."
Beautiful light festival,"The lights in the garden was beautiful. It was a really cold day and it helped that there were huts with heaters. The garden is huge and although we didn't manage to cover all ground, the sections that we visited were pretty."
Everything is glowing ,"This place is the last destination on our Nami Tour package. I am so grateful to my daughter that she got this tour for us in advance it was worth every penny. Since we have been up and about the whole day already, on this last destination we were so tired but upon seeing the spectacular display of lights we forgot how tired we were. We hopped from one garden to another. Each garden having its own unique, bright, colorful design. Taking photo is a bit challenging but I am proud to say that some of my best photos were taken here. Everything is glowing - aesthetically glowing. To my mind, the person who conceptualize this place is a genius because even if this country have 4 seasons, business runs 365 days. "
Highly recommended,"If you plan to visit, it should be at night, for minimum 2 hours. There are a lot of light decorations on trees, ground and sculptures. Most of them are beautifully executed, unique and attractive. It is the largest illuminated garden that I ever visited. Worth walking around every corner. You will be really amazed by different colours."
Calming Indeed,"We visited at night and had only around 1.5hrs to see the place. The view, with the numerous colored lights, was beautiful. I liked the cute little houses, the lake of lights, and the bridge. The place is serene and certainly calming; I wish we could have stayed longer.I think the place would be equally lovely on a fine autumn day.Entry fee was at 9000 won when we visited 1st week of December."
Winter Illumination at its finest in South Korea :),this was our last stop at Gapyeong so we reached at about 6PM there and the lights were already turned ON and the illumination was beyond amazing. an entry fee of KRW 9000 is worth it! :) the illuminations get better and better as you go further inside the garden. I recommend you go there early like around 6-7PM because there will still be a few people and light tunnels will not be as crowded as it will be in the later hours of the night. Just be prepared for a lot of couples holding hands and taking selfies while walking around the tunnes hahaha :P
A Christmas night at the Garden of the Morning Calm,"Absolutely spectacular! I have been to see Christmas lights in many places throughout the world and the Garden of the Morning Calm display is currently my favorite. There were tens of thousands of lights arranged in so many different ways, it was phenomenal. My favorite display was a pair of dolphins swimming in a sea of blue lights. The price for an adult to get in is 9000 won, for teenagers it is 6500 won and for children it is 5500 won. The hours to see the lights run from 5 to 9 pm. Plan on spending at least an hour and a half. There is on-site parking and a couple of food stands at the entrance where you can get some tasty snacks. I recommend the waffles. It is a pleasant way to spend an evening; prepare to be amazed!"
Lighting festival,"Absolutely gorgeous. the pictures do not do this park justice at all. the amount of holiday lights is unbelievable. the landscaping is so pretty. It was worth the drive and staying the night in the area to be able to experience this lighting festival. This is our last year living in Korea and this was on our bucket list before leaving, so glad that we didn't miss this. I strongly recommend coming here."
Nice garden,"we visited during one of the coldest time of the year, but despite the short time spent there (we were freezing!), we felt it was worth a trip. Moreover, there are plenty of very nice cafes enroute to the gardens that it's probably worth spending half a day here if u throw in a meal and coffee as well."
Extremely beautiful during the night ,"The Garden didn't look like much at first since the fallen wet snow and grey skies made everything look miserable, but as soon as the Lighting Fest started at 5pm, the whole atmosphere changed. I won't spoil you the suprise, but the view on the mountain when the lights are turned on is magical.Also visit the gift shop for some relaxing peppermint body mist and the café for fancy cuppas~ Also DRESS WARMLY. "
White Snowing Garden,We visit this garden in the early morning when it is covered by snow. It is quiet and beautiful. We experience the morning calm. The house there is so nice like a Swiss house. All the plants are in white colour which is peaceful and charming in this Thanksgiving and Christmas season!
Nature's beauty,"Its so disappointing that we only had limited time to roam the garden. We took the gapyeong city tour bus at 3PM and we arrived at the garden at 5PM. We thought its just minutes away from nami island but its way too far. It's already getting dark when we arrived there and we only spent 30mins. running, trying to capture the beauty that's fading away. I didn't have the chance to explore more especially the filming area of Love in the Moonlight. Definitely i'll be back next time."
Amazingly beautiful & colorful garden......,"This is one of the few attractions along a designated route by bus that brings you to Rail-Bike, Nami Island & Petite France, amongst others.You pay W6,000 for the round trip. Don't lose your ticket or you have to pay another W6000!This is such a colorful & beautiful garden. Take a nice relaxing stroll along the guided path & take time to admire nature's beauty at its best.Definitely worth the long journey here.No wonder this garden has been used for many Korean dramas settings."
Pretty flowers and colours during Autumn,"This is a place to visit during Autumn because all the flowers blend in so well together with the colours of the trees. It really calms the mind and soul and it is cooling to walk around during autumn (air-con) weather. This place a little big and if you would like to explore the whole place, might need 1-2 hours or so."
Autumn I think is the best time,"This vast garden is privately own, as informed my the day tour guide.During autumn, the colours are wonderful, no wonder K-dramas come here for filming.It is a good place for wedding/couple photography."
Must see for Autumn,Another beautiful place to visit.After Nami Island you can come here.Enjoy the autumn leaves and flowers.It can get crowded on weekends.Worth the visit. Spend at least 2 hours.
Awesome autumn colors in Oct 17,Truly one of the beautiful garden I've ever seen. The way the garden are filled with amazing autumn colors and beautifully landscaped. Do check out the cafe while there. The citrus drink and ice cream to die for.
"O Calm, O Ye Faithful","The winding road and a view of the Han river was a great backdrop on the way to the Garden of Morning Calm - right after the 3-hour stay at Nami Island and a brief stop-over at Petite France.We got to the Garden not because there were plentiful signs (virtrually no English signs!) but because our driver tour guide knows the way. As I mentioned in another review, going places in Korea seems to discourage independent travel by tourists (unless one would be able to get Google Maps which is not available there). Tour guides and package tours are therefore the rule of the day.Once at the Garden, the anxiety ebbs, The trees turning gold from green are a sight to behold even as Selfie-Takers are abundant. We wandered across the trails festooned with colorful foliage, an up and down trek that is a challenge to senior citizens and knee-handicapped. But I managed.The Garden also has cafes and bakery to soothe one's ankles and knee aches after visiting just a few of the multiple sections in the 30,000 sqm garden. I basked in the sunlight streaming from the trees serving as canopy to the cafe restaurant. Closing my eyes, I can hear the calming effect of the birds and if one listens really close some crickety sounds.I was told the garden would be stunning at night, especially during festivals. That October day we visited (by mid afternoon) there was nary an activity except for the continuous flow of visitors of all ages and nationalities.Have comfortable walking shoes and some warm clothing if visiting winter. It was fall and the weather was on the nippy side but not cold enough to warrant another layer of clothing. I love the cold as I had immunized myself from the San Francisco and Pacifica weather of the Bay Area.No cameras could beat what the eyes can see. But even if committed to memory, photos stored in DLSRs or today's smartphones are wonderful reminders of the Calm before the storm of everyday ritual."
Large Garden with nice scenery,"The Garden of Morning Calm is very large garden which located in Gapyeong-gun Gyeonggi-do. If you would like to see nice flowers, you should come around Spring & Summer. If you would like to see colorful leaves, you should come around Autumn (late October - mid of Nov). In the winter, there is ""Lighting Festival;""."
Autumn colours seen now,We visited in the last week of Oct 2017 and currently autumn colours visible here are the best we saw in Korea so far. Nice gardens and flowers. do visit the glass house which is a little small climb up not far from the entrance of the garden itself. The 1000 plus yr old tree is worth seeing. they have a coffee/snacks place inside
Absolutely stunning garden! A MUST-VISIT!,"We were here with 2 young children, age 4 and 6 around late afternoon close to evening. It was chilly but this garden is absolutely stunning!We were really impressed with the flower beds, the tranquility and picturesque scenery. My kids had fun running all over the place while the Hubby was busy taking photos. Known as Garden of Morning Calm, it is not difficult to know why. One must really visit this place!We booked a vehicle for a day starting to Petite France, Nami Island and last stop is The Garden Of Morning Clam, and I would say it was an awesome finale to our day!"
Calm and Relax,"Is a rather calm garden with not too many tourist. We arrived by 10am on 17 Oct and we had a good stroll round the garden and took pictures with no interruption. This season is a little too plain for me as we could see mostly chrysanthemum flowers, colourful and pretty. Well i must be expecting more than that. However we did enjoy walking round the garden peacefully and the good weather with blue sky and colorful background gave us good photos."
Nice Place to visit,"Nice flowers, nice scenery/place & nice Cafe to visit. The place are full of unique flowers and they sell nice coffee/tea & ice cream."
Rating for mid-November visit,"If you are to travel and visit Nami Island and stop by Garden of Morning Calm on a mid-November better think twice. Those who gave this a high rating went there during the right season. Around latter part of of autumn is not the best timing. We went there on exactly mid-November and all trees, flowers and leaves withered. Wrong choice for us as we forgot to factor in the season of the year.Visit this place when there is still good sun light. It got creepier by the minute as it was almost winter and we went there late afternoon after our Nami Island tour. They were still preparing the place for the winter light decor thus it would have been better if they did not let us in. It was clean, you can imagine how beautiful it must have been when the flowers are in bloom.We rented a car and a driver with the help of our Airbnb host so it wasn't difficult for us to get there coming from Nami Island. Parking wasn't hard either as there were almost no one else but us. I'll come back on a different season and hopefully I get to witness it's charm."
True to its name,The Garden of Morning Calm is true to its name. It is a very calming place. The gardens are well-attended and the place is well-designed. It is indeed very calming. I could probably just stay there the whole day and just appreciate its beauty.
Amazing landscapes,This is one place that i would go back to again and again!! Nature at its finest. There are some areas that is so surreal. Like your in a movie set. So beautiful! Like you will be transported in the Joseon area. Highly recommended!
NATURE AND PEACE,"You cant missed to visit Garden of Morning Calm if you will visit South Korea. I know Nami Island is really popular but I like this better than Nami Island (of course, no doubt Nami Island is really a beautiful destination). I suggest to book a tour if you will visit this place because most of tourist spots at South Korea are really far and sometimes takes more than 2 hours . Klook offers really reasonable fee for Garden of Morning Calm with Nami Island and Petite Island tour. I suggest to visit this place on spring (April) and autumn (october) season."
Beautiful garden to view with Nami Island,"If you have time after Nami island, take the Gapyeong tour bus to go to this garden. Remember to keep the bus ticket for it is good for the whole day to travel between different locations. The garden itself is large and beautifully designed, I'm sure it will be stunning during autumn and spring. There are plenty of flowers and trees. A good alternative to Seoul and its not far away!"
Fall in love with nature here.. Flora at its best,"We did a full day tour that include this place was 4 location, this was our last stop by which we were all tired...There is truly much to see and just sooo mesmerizing . I would advise to come here for a full day or half day trip on its own as theres soooo much to see and sooo many sections to explore. They truly do have good upkeep of the flowers. Some i have never seen nor heard off. Loves the small huts, wooden chairs and wooden platforms for ppl to take picture and rest a bit.. Due to the tiredness a bunch of us decided to check out 2 out of about 10 sections... but still that 90mins flew by tooo fast . Will definitely come back here... and truly enjoy the whole place and the wonders it offers. TIPS: Do spend some time in their gift shop.. as its all natural using the flowers, leaves and herbs that they grew on the premises.. and the natural stress relief oil thats comes in a roll-on vial is soo good that i truly felt stupid for not purchasing a few more bottles.  Thirsty ? the shikye at the stalls upfront really took the summer/spring heat away... Yums!!!"
beautiful but a bit out of the way,"If your itinerary includes Nami Island, Petit France and Garden of the Morning Calm, that might be pushing it. They may all be in Gapyeong, but its a huge place!My thoughts:First, one would need a car to go to these places. I have not seen a lot of taxis, but I was told there were buses.Second, i would suggest a trip here early morning or late afternoon. High-noon sunlight is not really an ideal time to take photos, especially if one is just using a mobile phone.Third, as the name suggests, it's a garden. Nice to stroll (but not during high-noon), take pictures, and admire flowers.I went just this August, it was end-summer season. Maybe it would be an amazing sight during Autumn."
Beautiful to visit and EXCELLENT for lunch!!!!!!!!!!,"If you came in Seoul you MUST visit these gardens: really a blow-up of flowers and threes of any kind and colors...!The best way to visit it is by Seul-metro (about 1,5 hours) and after by bus (about 15 mins.).If you are hungry I recommend you to eat at the restaurant inside the garden (restaurant, NOT Café!): it offers food of the Korean tradition. I and my wife have eaten the Mul naengmyeon, an excellent cold noodles soup with ginger and other vegetables.We got our compliments to the Chef!!!A lite and simple restaurant, but.... which flavors!!!!!!"
Amazing garden and beautiful garden,"I went to this garden for the first time. Went i came to this garden, it looks amazing garden that i have ever seen. There's so many beautiful flowers in here and this place have a cold weather according when i gone this place in spring. Please bring a jacket for you preparation and also bring umbrella. It's recommended for those people who loves a kind of flowers and want to take a picture also relax. This place is cozy and leisure. Have fun. Thanks"
What a Garden !!!!,"This garden is incredible. Full of nature, beautiful sceneries, flowers galore. A must see even if you are not a nature enthusiast. I just wish my tour had allocated more time to enjoy the garden because even though it is not very big, the hilly paths slows down the pace. "
Well spent autumn,"I'm from a country where there's no 4 seasons, which brings me to why i love this place to the max. I will visit this garden for endless time."
Amazing garden of lights,It was that time of the year when the garden was dry with no flowers so they installed thousands of colorful and artfully designed lights on almost every surface. Soo awesome!! You wouldn't know which place to see first. Every which way you look was beautiful! It was like being transported into another world. As it was very cold our cameras froze and we lost a lot of photo opportunities. Best decision was waiting for the lights to be turned on which was around 6PM. Otherwise we would live to regret it!
"Beautiful garden, great for a stroll","Took about 2 hours to get there from Seoul. Was worth the trip. You will be surrounded by beautiful flowers, trees and plants. Great getaway from the city. Very big garden, takes about 2 hours to finish walking around the whole place."
Summer @Garden of the Morning Calm,"Was there in end Jun, after visiting the Petite France we took the Shuttle Bus to Garden of the Morning Calm. Reached about 4.30pm but was still hot and bright! My main objective to visit this place is because of the filming site for ""Love in the Moonlight"" . Fortunately and unfortunately there was filming for another K drama when I reached the ""Pond garden"". Didn't manage to take pics of myself at the Pond garden but lucky to bump into the K stars. Overall the garden is peaceful. Quite alot of walking if you want to complete the whole place."
Beautiful garden,This was the first stop of my day trip (followed by Nami and railbike). I left my Jonggak apartment at 8am and reached hzere at 9.30am.Garden is very enchanting and peaceful. I could imagine it would be even better if it is spring or Autumn period. i stayed for 2 hrs here including taking morning coffee at a cafe in the garden. Didnt finish the walking trail because the old folks in my group can't walk too much and a bit too hot after 11am. 
Beautiful and calm-if you go early!,The garden really is lovely and calm nut only if you arrive as soon as it opens. Very quickly the small road leading to the garden gets backed up with cars. The parking gets full and you have to walk quite a distance from the overflow parking. The garden itself has many beautiful areas for photo opportunities but they quickly become full of other people snapping photos too. Definitely carry in your own water ad there are not many places to find drinks and shaded space is at a premium on hot days. It can be a lot of walking for young children who may get bored by the gardens. I recommend visiting the gift shop at the entrance for some refreshing mint body spray samples to cool down at the end. 
Truly Relaxing!,I was sucked in by its calmness and unending beauty that made me wanna stay and stare at its unique beauty till all the lights go off.
Absolutely amazing gardens with fabulous views and walking trails,"My friends and I were blown away by the beauty of the gardens at this park as well as how well-maintained, clean, and organized it is. We visited during the late summer and enjoyed 2 hours of walking the trails, taking photos of the gardens, and enjoying the fresh air. Our friends' children ages 5 and 10 were just as excited about the park as we were! Everyone had a great time and found the gardens very peaceful and enjoyable. There are also plenty restrooms in the large park as well as dining and shopping options at the entrance/exit. We are Americans living here for 2-3 years and plan to bring any friends or family who visit us here in Korea to see this amazing place!"
Lovely garden,"This place is simply beautiful. It was a surreal experience roaming around a massive garden. It was in mid-April when my friend and I visited this place so it was spring time. Not all the flowers, unfortunately, were in full bloom when we went there but the natural landscape of the garden still made the place worth visiting for. As we were strolling around, there was a sense of tranquility and calm zest that envelop the whole place. My favorite spot in the garden was the Road to Heaven. It was an area full of tulips of different variety and colors. It was simply breathtaking seeing an array of tulips in full bloom. So I highly suggest this place especially for plant lovers like me."
Blooming flowers,Totally recommended place to came during spring!! Flowers were blooming beautifully. You can take the subway to cheongpyeong station and take the bus tour (bus will only cost 6000krw for 1 day pass).
Impressive tulips with morning dew,"I went there in a package tour and arrived in early morning. Lots of tulips still covered in morning dew. Not many tourists then hence I could really feel the atmosphere of ""morning calm"". Took many photos of beautiful tulips and I was quite satisfied with the visit."
Serenity!,The place is just perfect. We came here just in time for the flowers to bloom. Indeed the Garden of Morning Calm. Breathe the fresh air the smell of the blooming flowers and serenity of the place!
Beautiful Walk in The Gardens,"Highly recommended for those of you who are into nature and enjoying scenic views of the countryside alongside beautifully landscaped flowers and pants.We spent about 2 hours at this place. Entrance fee was 8000 won per person, coupled with a bus fare of 6000 won from the Gapyeong City Tour Bus (that brings travellers to many other places of interest within the region). Suggest to get to Morning Calm from CheongPyeong train station, if Morning Calm is your first destination in the day, as it is only 20 minutes from CheongPyeong train station as compared to about an hour from Gapyeong train station. Also recommended to visit Garden of Morning Calm in the earlier or later part of the day, so it is less hot and you can enjoy the sunset views and a cool weather after 5pm. The tulips here in Spring time are beautiful :)"
Tulips and cherry blossom in spring,We visited this place on 10 April 2017. Tulips here already blooming and beautiful even though not so many of them. There was also some cherry blossom here. But most of the trees still barren without leaves.
Beautiful View,Still very cold weather when I been there.. even no much flower but got lighting show.. it is very beautiful. Very relax when going there
Unique colorful lights!!,"Spent few hours in Garden Of Morning Calm with my friend Priscilla after Nami island tour and Petit France. We rode in a hop on hop off bus which is very convenient and affordable as well. Reached the place at 5 pm , bought tickets and headed inside. The highlight was at 6:30 pm! The garden was full of beautiful small light bulbs in flowers shapes!! Spent three hours taking pictures and meeting other people. Last trip for all buses were at 7:30 going back to the city. Would have preferred to stay overnight but couldn't. "
Would have been a nice garden.. but all imagination,"The ad and other reviews were nice so we set time to visit this garden, even skipping Petite France because we thought it is nicer to come here with our limited time. When we were inside, we were there earlier than 4:30 and the tea house and morning coffee cafe were closed. There were a lot of works being done but all not yet prepared. we saw ropes on the sides, seedlings that they plan to plant somewhere, closed signs that we couldn't pass through. The most disappointing was we thought it would be nice to spend the sunset and I was expecting they will open the lights, as I have seen in most reviews, but all too depressing. They closed 6:30 (i think, or maybe earlier) while it was still daylight and we didnt see any lightings. My group were waiting for the lights to open and we didnt know that they have already closed the placed. No one told us that they've closed and that they will not light up the garden. What a waste of our precious time in Seoul. Probably better to visit some other time, but not during late March to early April."
Visit after sunset!,"Despite the name, you should come here on the evening after the sunset!The garden here is decorated with colorful LED that's so beautiful and it can only be seen after sunset.I would recommend the following itinerary to get the best out of this area:1st Trip, catch the earliest train to go to Nami Island, explore the area just before afternoon.2nd Go to petite france until just before sunset (catch the bus at 16.30 - 17.30 TOP)3rd Visit this garden to enjoy it's beauty on the eveningTherefore you get the best period of visit on each of the above destination.."
Breathtaking views,"I arrived at The Garden of Morning Calm at around 6 plus in the evening where the sky was still bright. Initially, I thought that the view was average until I walked on to find that the Garden was bigger than expected. The illuminations were really well done and it is pretty much something you should do in winter. Nothing to be disappointed with because you could never go wrong with fairy lights. The food at the Korean restaurant was pretty satisfying with friendly staff there. There are limited choices of food selection though. If eating in a restaurant is not within your budget, there is a small cafe that sells food nearby too. Do take note of the shuttle bus timings back to the station though. I missed the last shuttle bus back and had to take a cab - which cost me around 19,000won."
Real life Alice in Wonderland,"I am a student living in Seoul, and traveled to the Garden of Morning Calm by subway. I really wanted to see the light show in this garden. It was more than I imagined. Had some spectacular photos and had amazing time in there even though we travelled for more than 3 hours to see this. It was worth. After subway station, we took taxi which was cost 15700 won and coming back was 15400 won. "
Fantastic Garden to go to!,We went in late November so was worried that the colourful scenery we wanted to see won't be there.. but luckily that wasn't the case. It is a huge garden with lots of different areas of interest to explore- we also saw a tv or movie crew set using one of the locations!This is a great place to visit if you want to visit a nature based place outside of the busy urban life of Seoul. It is a bit far (you have to catch a train and a bus) but still worth the visit. We probably took maybe 2 hours to explore the whole place?There were a cafe and some souvenir stores as well onsite.
Beautiful Winter Illumination,"Went there after visiting Nami Island. Took the Gapyeong Tour Bus, 1 hour 30 mins ( One Day Ticket KRW 6 000 CASH ONLY, T Money Card not accepted ) . Waited for about 30 minutes in the freezing cold at the bus stop across the road from GS 25 convenience store. On hind sight, should have taken a taxi ( less than KRW 4 000 ) to Gapyeong station and take the Gyeongchun train to Cheongpyeong station and then a taxi or bus to the garden.We reached the garden before 5.00 pm and went for early dinner at the only Korean restaurant ( There were stalls selling street food just before the ticket office )The winter illumination was worth the KRW 8 000 entrance fee."
Wonderful Place!,"This place is a must-visit if you ever go to Seoul. When I first hear it, that sounds so simple, just a place with a bunch of lamps made into cute characters and so on. But it was actually so pretty! They made the lamps into something pretty. There was a sea (I kid you not) made of lamps, then there are tunnels also made by lamps. Then they cover the trees and small plants also with lamps. You have to wait for the sunset then the magic will come out.Although the lamps were wonderful and the garden was magnificent. But it was too cold during the winter, even without wind the place is so cold.Other than that, this place is wonderful and beautiful!"
Winter has its own charm,The Garden of Morning Calm has a different face every season. Most pictures were taken during the colorful autumn or spring. I visited it in winter where the lighting festival was at its brightest. Although a little cold but it's really charming and dreamy.
Quite a Magnificent View,"This should definitely be one of the places you visit in winter! The lighting switches on around 5-6 pm and it becomes a real magnificent sight when the sky turns dark. You'd definitely love it. Also, it is pretty accessible with the shuttle bus service even though it is a good 1 hour drive from Petite France stop. I would suggest planning your time nicely so you can visit Nami-Petite France-Garden of Morning Calm. "
Exceed my Expectations!,Visited the place during Winter season so the attraction have transform to a light festival instead. The lighting replaces the wilted flowers and decorated the hills in vibrant colours! Took so much photos here!
Beautiful lights,"The Garden of Morning Calm is located about 1.5 hours outside of Seoul and is worth a visit during their winter lighting festival. It is certainly quite a spectacle over its rather grounds. There were quite a lot of tourists but other than some of the major phototaking spots, didn't feel too bad. I wish I had more time to slowly walk the grounds but it was also a very cold night."
Good Place with Beautiful Lightings,"The garden lights up only in the winter and it sure brings out the calming feel of the winter. Worth coming for people who appreciates scenic views, lights, and colors."
Colourful lights!,Very nice and romantic view if u come at night whereby the whole garden is litted up with colourful lights and many beautiful designs. Romantic place to visit and also for children who can have some fun in the miniature small huts!
Lighting Festival at the Garden,"Very interesting trip to the garden. We ended up arriving at the garden ahead of our schedule, well before sundown and walked around, taking photos before the twilight hours. Ponds were starting to freeze, but many of the bonsais still kept their leaves and therefore their shapes. After finishing a round of photo taking, decided to fill up the stomach at the Korean Restaurant, while waiting for the light up. Decent bugolgi. The lights came on at about 5.10pm, well ahead of the scheduled 6pm, but that was expected as it was dark already. Lights were amazing and filled the gardens in many places. Got very crowded very quickly as many tour buses arrived just for the lights. Tough to get clear shots of the lighted stuff without having other people photo-bomb your efforts. Recommend that proper cameras are used instead of phone cameras as the lights will over-expose the shot if fill flash is not used. Phone camera flash is just to weak in comparison. Also if leaving the garden using the Gapyong Tourist Shuttle Bus, please gauge the crowd and decide to queue up early. We left the garden at 6.30pm and there was a long queue for the bus. Could not board the 7pm and only got on the 7.30pm bus. Standing room only and packed like sardines. So do plan to exit early to ensure you get to the train station on time. "
Winter wonderland,"It was heavily snow when we came so we enjoy the snow fall and the lighting show. The lighting show was very interesting and beautiful. It was simply awesome! The garden was heavily lighted. However, if the temperature is below zero, there are only few places where you can stay warm. Overall .. 5 stars!"
Winter wonderland Gyung Gi style! ,We visited this wonderful garden on 9 December 2016. The winter garden without lights was good too but after the sunset it transformed into a wonderland and the way they decorated was very creative and intriguing. Really nice and reminded me of the California Disney's light parade which was ceased in late 1990s. Gift shops sell their own products and some are exceptionally pretty in particular pressed flower accessories. 
Very beautiful with all the autumn colours,"This is a great place to visit in ANY season. It lives up to its name where it gives off a very calm, tranquil vibe. Perfect place to stroll through and leave all your worries behind. Do make sure you have plenty of memory space in your camera for photos!"
Nice place for a walk,Lots of well-kept flower beds and paths. Several greenhouses display some nice varieties of native plants.At Christmas there's lots of pretty lights.You could easily spend 3 hours here if you loved gardening and plants.Not enough places to sit and rest if you need a break.
Lovely garden,"Arrived at 1030am, had a very lovely walk around the gardens with nice relaxing nature walk, photo taking, and finishing off at Good Morning Cafe which serves great barista coffee. Nice to experience Korean styled garden, esp in Autumn. Recommend this if you are in Gapyeong."
