A novel experience,"Because Gapyeong is apparently higher than Seoul, and because we could only get a reservation for the 17:00 ride, it was cold. Fortunately I had the foresight to purchase a woolen hat, that covered my ears, while walking around Gapyeong. However my hands were cold on the return trip.The ride itself was nice enough, and we really didn’t have to pedal very much. It is autumn now and the leaves are turning colors. My companion on this journey was impressed, but I , who grew up in an area where the leaves change colors, was not.Despite the nearly cold head, the cold hands, and the not too impressive autumn leaves, it was a novel and pleasant experience, and I recommend to those contemplating doing it."
Good for all age,"There are 2 seats and 4 seats bike. We take one 4 seats bike, cheaper than two 2 seats bike. I find that most 3 people family with 1 kid also choose 3 seats bike. It is easy to ride. The whole ride take about 1 hour with a break about 5 minutes at the end stop to let you buy photo taken by the machine when you are riding. We start at 2:00p.m. and finished before 3:30p.m."
Amazing Pedaling Experience,The last stop of our Gapyeong Tour with KKDay.I really had fun while pedaling with my friends and the foreigner we met.The bubble tunnel and the disco tunnel were so fun.You will really enjoy this park.
Fun activity with the kids,A 6.5km quad bike ride on rails across scenic country side and tunnels.Really interesting experience that is unique.Also great opportunity to throw in a bit of exercise on the pedals during the holiday.Not very tiring as it’s pretty much a downhill ride with some short stretches of climb. The total ride lasted approx 30mins at leisurely speed.Will recommend anyone who wants a different experience besides theme parks.
Actually TWO rail parks,"If you look at their website (English and Korean), they actually show three different locations for their rail bikes. Numbers 1 and 2 are actually the same thing, you start in Gapyeong and end up in Gyeong-gang and then they spin you around and return you to Gapyeong along the same route. It can be accessed via the Gapyeong tour bus that can be taken from the main train station.This is the route that I tried with my boyfriend, which takes you across the Bukhan River bridge and Zelkova tunnel. It was beautiful and a really fun experience. I wish other countries would do something like this with their abandoned railway tracks. Super inventive and super easy as the carts are kinetic and build up energy as you pedal so you don't need to pedal all the time. You therefore can take all the photos you want and eat any snacks you bought that can be stored in the tray between the seats. There was also room for two normal sized backpacks on the rack behind the cart and it even had a tinted canopy to protect from the sun.Number 3 on the website is the Gimyujeong route and this is the one where reviewers have talked about going through 3 tunnels including a VR tunnel. It takes you to Nanggu village and can be accessed via romantic train and shuttle bus. I can't comment on how this one was but be aware when planning your trip as to which one you would like to visit."
A fun activity on an old rail track,"This is a unique activity that is a clever use of an old infrastructure. Instead of the rails being removed or left abandoned, they use it for recreational activity.The trail is 8km long in total, 4km each way with a short break at the turning point. The rail bikes are equipped with a electric motor which only kicks in during the uphill parts of the track. This is not only helpful, but it makes it safer for everyone so that ""bikes"" roll backwards."
Fun,This place is a must if you are going to Gapyeong! A lot of beautiful view that you can shoot along the way and it was so peaceful and calm 
Fun day trip ,"We had such a fun time, wasn’t sure what to expect but definitely good, go one way and then there is a 10 min break. At the beginning of the journey there is a phone op, smile for the camera, and make sure you go to the rest stop to pick up your picture! Definitely a fun must do! Thought it would be difficult to get to but we just took the subway super easy! Subway line GYEONGCHUN LINE and get off at Gapyeong stop! "
A great outdoor experience,"We went there during winter season. It was so cold, but we enjoyed just the same. One memorable outdoor experience fo the family."
Kinda cool concept,The park itself is not so special. A number of statues and fountains but the real draw is the rail car. Ride is s but shorter than advertised but that’s IK as when not downhill it’s a bit of peddling. Tunnel exhibits are hokey but outside scenery is quite pleasant. Cars are a bit too close together and congestion caused a number of stops. OK way to spend an hour and a half I suppose but not a reason to visit Korea.
An enjoyable and fun time on the rail bike!,"My family and I spent an enjoyable one and half hour on a weekday late morning with a blazing June sun at this attraction Getting there: We first took the metro to Yongsan Station (Line 1), followed by the ITX train to Gapyeong Station (ITX-Cheongchun Line), the latter journey took about 60 minutes. We had a tricky time finding the right place to take the ITX train and purchasing the tickets at the auto ticket machine since we don’t understand Korean. My advice is to book the ITX train ticket online and be at the station early because the ITX train departs to Gapyeong every 30 minutes (missing the infrequent ITX train may result in you reaching the Gapyeong Rail Bike site late) When we arrived at Gapyeong Station, we had three choices to go to Gapyeong Rail Park: (1) Take the taxi – the trip is about 5 minutes(2) Take the Gapyeong Intra-City bus - Ask the bus driver whether the bus goes to ‘Gapyeong Bus Terminal’ before paying the bus fare of ₩1300. Upon alighting at Gapyeong Bus Terminal, walk about 5 minutes to Gapyeong Rail Park. (3) Take the Gapyeong City Tour Bus – a one day pass costs ₩6000 per person (excludes entrance fees to attractions) and has to be bought from the bus driver. The departure schedule is at the bus stop and among the stops include Gapyeong Rail Bike, Nami Island, Petitie France and Garden of Morning CalmFor my family and I of four persons, taking the taxi was the most cost effective option and the taxi fare eventually was ₩3900 won. The attraction: I strongly recommend booking and paying online due to the popularity of this attraction. We booked the 10:30am for a 4-person rail bike on Funtastic Korea. Upon reaching 20 minutes before our time slot (don’t be late or your ride may be subject to cancelation), we redeemed our vouchers with tickets at the ticket box. The price is and ₩35,000 for 4 seater rail bike (₩25,000 for 2 seater rail bike). Before we cycled, the staff explained safety procedures - fasten seat belts at all time, do not stand up during riding the rail bike, keep the distance with the front bike etc. The good part is we didn’t have to cycle throughout because at certain sections of the rail (e.g. uphill), the rail bike automatically moved by itself albeit at a slow speed.The route takes you from the starting point (Gapyeong Rail Bike Station) to the half way point (Gyeonggang Station) whereupon after resting, you cycle back in the opposite direction to the starting point in the same rail bike (so do remember your rail bike number). The staff told us the resting time was 15 minutes at Gyeonggang Station but in the end, it was 20 minutes. Nevertheless, the 20 minutes was enough for you to relax the muscles, eat (ice cream) at the cafe, buy things from the convenient store, take toilet break and take plenty of photographs, wefies and selfies of the old Gyeonggang Station and the disused railway tracks. I read that this Station was used for the filming of the 2017 Korean TV drama “Doctors”. What we liked:We enjoyed the beautiful scenery of the Han River and the surrounding mountains, the Gyeongchun-ro Bridge and the countryside. It was great that the rail track was mostly covered from the sun by short trees, which creates a picturesque yellow-green-brown (sun-leaves-trunk/branches) combination of Nature. The tree branches also “aligned” themselves to form a “Zelkova Tree Tunnel”. Lastly, we also enjoyed the thrill of cycling across two rail bridges some 30 metres above the river.  Gapyeong Rail Bike (Park) is such great fun and exercise for the family, couples and friends. I highly recommend this attraction!"
One-of-a-kind experience!,"A much-enjoyed experience during my trip to Korea, the Gapyeong Rail Park allows you to get a great view of the Han River as you pedal your own rail bike across bridges and a tree tunnel. Not tiring at all and very serene, something different from your regular sight-seeing tours :)"
New experience ,"For those who want to experience this rail bike, it is better to book online as they have limited bikes and time slots. We went there by ourselves, we took taxi from the train station. It will be nice to do it in the morning as you can continue to nearby attractions like Nami Island. Arrive early as they will depart sharp on time. You will need to cycle around 30 minutes from Gapyeong station to Gyeonggang station. You are required to stop and alight at Gyeongggang for about 15-20 minutes before continue cycling back to Gapyeong. There is a cafe, washroom and pictures kiosk here. Hence, whole journey takes about 1.5 hours. I won’t recommended for family with very young kids as you are required to cycle manually all the way and you are basically on your own at the rail along the way. Staff are only available at the stations. No emergency call button at the bike too. Unfortunately, they only give instructions in Korean. "
Most enjoyable rail bike ride.,Definitely a must to do the rail bike rail! Don't seems like a 40mins ride as perhaps we were cycling a little tad too fast! Worth a half day trip!
Breathtaking view along the track,"Take a day tour package from Seoul to Nami Island - Gapyeong Rail Park - Petite France. It’s worth to visit and it costs you around SGD200 (booked through ChangiRecommends website). This is a rail bike park (means you take a bike along a rail track). The bikes come in 2 configurations - 4-seater and 2-seater (private, they charge more for this). The whole track spans around 8km which is covered around 45minutes. You take a bike one way and there will be a chartered by a train back to the exit station (beware, the 20-min train journey wasn’t enjoyable at all as the train was super jam packed with people). You gotta keep on pedalling as if your bike stops, the one behind you cannot go on as well. What I love about the track is, it’s surrounded by beautiful scenery! It also goes to a few tunnels (they surprisingly decorated the tunnels with holograms or some glow in the dark deco). I really love this experience but it could get pretty tiring actually especially when it was freaking cold (the temperature was -12C when we went in late Dec). "
Fun & relaxing activity amidst nice views.......,"This is a very interesting & fun attraction where visitors gets hands-on rather than just look around.You rent either a 2 seaters or 4 seaters bike depending on number of people. Pedal the bike at your own pace along a long, closed railway track route - with nice scenic views on both sides.However, you need to look out for the bikes infront & behind you, & keep moving. After awhile, your feet definitely will get tired. The bike moves automatically even if you don't pedal it but at a slower pace. However on upslopes sections, you still have to pedal.The ride one way takes about 30-40 mins. You are told to take a 5 mins break for rest/toilets at the end ( but usually it lasted about 20mins).After which you ride back the same way you came. All in, takes about 1.5 hours.Highly recommended to try this Railbike if here. "
Autumn in Seoul and caves,Very exciting and fun. The different caves we passed through have different themes. We took the 4 seater. We enjoyed it. Should try. 
Fun park,"Railbike? Wow...i can't imagine how to bike half hour...with so many people there.We start at 4 pm,and it was raining...2 or 4 people in 1 bike..and it was really fun..Seeing beautiful sceneries,entering the beautiful tunnels...up and downhills..and also quite tiring."
Simply lovely,"We were toying with making our own way to Gangwon Railbike, Nami island and Petite France as we did in 2014. But we remembered it was quite a pain to miss the public buses and ferry that ran on scheduled time, and queuing for tickets. So we decided to pay extra for the day tours which you can find on trazy, klook or fantastickorea. It was well worth thePrice(estimated about double the price had we DIY). The pickup was so near to our myeongdong hotel and we sat in comfy tour coaches and they even have a guide on the bus. Gangwon rail would be most ideal in autumn. It's a nice experience and we would go again! "
Disappointment,"We have been looking forward to this rail bike at gapyeong. First, we were told there were time schedules for the rail bike, and we have missed the 2pm schedule due to miscommunication from the gapyeong tourist bus driver. The next schedule was 330pm and the unfriendly ticketing attendant did not advised us to get the tickets prior to the schedule. So we went to nearby Isaac cafe for coffee, and approached the ticketing counter at 3pm. The ticketing officer told us it was sold out, no more rail bikes as two coaches of tourists came and booked all the rail bikes. They should have reserved some for the others and not all for the coach tourists. Frustrated at the ticketing attendant very unfriendly."
