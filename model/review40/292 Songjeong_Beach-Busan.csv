A beautiful and clean beach ,"Randomly booked Hotel Laon and when I arrived and initially saw the view from my hotel room, a smile spread across my face. What a view of such a pretty beach. This is what you call a secluded beach especially visiting this beach during the off peak season. Every morning you would see a handful of surfers catching the waves. Waking up to see the sunrise was amazing. This beach is served by the over ground train and can be a trek to go to see some of the sights in busan but is nearby to via the overground and subway station to Haeundae beach which is the more popular beach. Ten minute walk to the closest train station. And a minute walk from Hotel Laon was this place that did fabulous french toast. All in all I was a happy bunny."
L0VE this beach!,"We stayed at Hotel Carib, which gave us a perfect view of the many surfers who were out doing their thing every day....I loved it! True, it's maybe not the best place for really swimming, but for a great view and just dipping your toes in the sea, you really can't beat it!"
The best 'wave' beach along the coast.,"While Australian tourists might be underwhelmed by the wave sizes in Korea, Songjeong is a beautiful beach in its own right and the best for breaking waves on a windy day! Picturesque best describes the view on a blue sky day. Well worth a stop if you are heading north to Haedong Yonggung Temple."
Great beach spot!,"Song Jeong is an awesome spot, especially early in the morning. My favorite beach in Busan to visit especially when the sun is rising. It's quiet and the few surfers out there are having a great time. During the day, the traffic gets heavier so parking takes time, but there's food stalls, surf shops, coffee shops, seafood and the beach to make up for that inconvenience. Definitely recommended as a tour / hang out spot."
Less crowded than Heundae but you still can't swim here,"Good hotels, good cafes at the beach and good and inexpensive restaurants in the neigbourhood. The beach is much less crowded than Heaundae and quite pleasant for sleeping or having fun with little kids.But the rule on guarded beaches in Busan is no swimming beyond buoys that are chest-deep during the high tide and below-the-waist deep during the low tide, so you basically cannot go more than ca 30 meters away from the shore. It's strongly enforced by many lifeguards, you hear their whistles almost permanently. After swimming there and back again and again along the buoys, constantly pestered by the lifeguards, because you're too near to them and kicking the sand in shallow water, you'll get annoyed soon.It is also prohibited to enter the water after 6 PM. Not to swim, they'll kick you out when you're walking knee-deep along the shore.And that surely weren't bad weather rules, those rules apply all the time.If you want to have fun in the sea, just don't go to Busan beaches. They won't let you have it."
Quiet beach and nice atmosphere,"Here is a more quiet beach and beautiful as you expect it to be on a weekend getaway.Sunny day needed to see the beauty of the water and sand tho.I was there on a Sunday/Monday, and it was not crowded at all.its a surfer beach but dont expect waves, that's for beginners.Its still quiet at night, couples and family are coming Some good seafood restaurants, cheap and great hotel (I recommend Songjeong Marina Resort) nice view of the beach.The sunrise at the hotel was breathtaking.If you spend 2 nights there, I can assure you that you would feel disconnected.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for at least a night as it is far from everything else but its worth itI will come back for sure someday !"
Clean beach and water.,"I come from a country that has many vast natural beautiful beaches, so this looks small but well maintained with many facilities for the beach goer. Overall, there is nothing special about it."
In constant evolution,"The beach is great for swimming during the summer months, and it is full of places to eat and dine and have coffee with friends all year around. It is very open sea beach, so you feel nature around, and surrounded by buildings where all sercvices are provided. So close to Busan and as good as the city. "
Nice beach with surfers,Nice quiet beach (off season) to enjoy the sea breeze and watch the surfers . Surfers are out there any time of the year and there are some small coffee shop to relax . Worth the visit as this is only a 10-15 mins drive from Haeundae beach . Highly recommended for people who like more natural surroundings .
Pick up your rubbish,A beautiful place ruined by weekend beach goers leaving their rubbish. Lovely walks at the temple hill end. Lovely old ladies selling their home grown greens early in the morning in the street. Nice places to eat near the reserve road off the beach. 
Excellant Beach,A great place for romance. On one side you can see sky scrappers and on the other side its the fury of the mighty sea. Sunset is awesome.
Coffee overdose,"I have never seen so many coffee shops and vans in such a small area, and go in off the beach and the trend continues in the shops just of the beach. I get the idea that this beach is for the younger surfer crowd judging by the number of surfing outlets and learn to surf adverts. It was a nice beach though, although I would say devoid of enough surf to even warrant a surf board. The town behind the beach was a little drab."
Quiet Beach,We had a great time at the beach. Wonderful for family. You can rent a chair and an umbrella for the day. Tons of coffee shops and places to eat. The crowds were calm and not much of a party place so it was great for a family with children. We will be back. 
Laid back beach.,This is one of the stops on the hop-on hop-off bus tour and we loved it here. The place has a village type of feel to it with its own fishing harbor and nice beach and laid back coffee shops over looking the beach with many many people surfing.
Beautiful and clean beach with many services in the area. Hermosa y limpia playa con muchos servicios en el area.,"We went surfing with some friends and we had no issues finding boards for rental (only soft top though, try Monkey Surf, about 2 blocks from the beach) also there were many cafes and restaurants around. The water was clean too and not too cold at all (Sept/Oct). Fuimos a surfear con unos amigos y no tuvimos problemas para encontrar arriendo de tablas, solo de espuma, y trajes, prueban en el Monkey Surf, 2 cuadras de la playa) tambien habian muchos cares y restaurantes alrededor. El agua estaba limpia y no estaba muy helada, (Septiembre-Octubre)"
Best beach in Busan,"What I like about the Songjeong Beach is the surfing activity. It is less crowded than the Haeundae Beach. And lots of coffeeshops for relaxation and pasttime.I can definitely recommend surfing in this beach. For an additional activity, you can hike the small hill at the end of the beach, where you can indulge in light exercises. They have installed light equipment for exercise. There is also a temple at the end of the trail, where you can just sit down and enjoy the cool breeze. A good spot for an afternoon nap."
Lovely place but not in August,"In June, it was wonderful and quite but I don't recommend going in August if you want to see people camping, cooking and almost living on an overcrowded beach. Anyway, in June... it was nice. There were plenty of shells and surfers. There is only 1 restaurant for foreigners but it's ok."
Good!,"The beach is just nice and chilling, not too crowded. Although here they have a club for surfing, it is quite small for senior ones, just for beginners. Anyway, it is also a nice place to kill your time or you just donâ€™t want to work out too much."
A Much More Traditional Beach,"Songjeong Beach is a breath of fresh air after experiencing Haeundae Beach. It is much more similar to the sleepy little coastal towns up an down the California coast. It is laid-back and relaxed. Not nearly as many people go to this beach and it is longer than Haeundae, so it always has areas for reflection, relaxation, and contemplation. Many coffee shops are located along the beach with views out over the water, so a person can sit and enjoy watching the waves, watching surfers trying to get up on their boards, or just listening to the sounds of the sea. A coffee shop I recommend is the Angel-In-Us coffee shop. Many times friends of mine would go early in the morning to drink coffee and watch the sunrise over the beach. Songjeoung Beach is worth the visit."
Surfing Hits Korea,"For those who have the luxury of great surf beaches in their country, surfing in Korea seems almost ""why""! But if you've surfed around the world why not tick Korea off your list. The surf is ultra small and really only for beginners but there are a hard core of enthusiasts here that love it. so more power to them. The Songjeong Surfing club and others rent out long boards so take a leap into the icy cold waters and have some bragging rights. Sure your sirens have surfed Bali, Mauritius and Portugal but have they hit the swell in Korea? Actually there are several other surf beaches worth exploring. And there's some great coffee shops nearby to warm you up."
Less touristy,"This is a lovely sandy beach, crowded but less touristy than Gwagnam or Haeundae which equates to very little English in the signage or places to eat and stay. . Surfing lessons and also covered with umbrellas but a bit less expensive. Cold water and full coverage swimming, the two women in bikinis seemed shocking in contrast. "
Worth a Visit,This beach is for a quieter crowd than those wishing to go to Haeundae. Check out the organic restaurant for the best food ever.
"Nice little beach with some surfboard rental, shops, and restaurants right across the street","This is a cute little beach, in a sheltered little bay, with some charming little surf shops (tons of surfboard rental), cafe's, restaurants, and stores. It looked very clean (Korea in general is very clean). "
Better Beach in Busan,"One of the better beaches around Busan, it is less expensive and less crowded than Haeundae Beach. There are salt water spas and great restaurants. Also, a famous ancient temple is close by. Accessible by convenient city express bus and local train."
My favourite beach in Busan. But MOVE THE SWIMMING BOUNDARY'S OUT!!!,"Best beach in Busan. The water is clean, the sane is nice and it isn't as busy as Haeundae. Although it is getting busier over the years. But they really must move the swimming boundary out. It is far to close to the shore and during low tide it doesn't give you anywhere to swim. The strip could use less cafe's and more food. "
"A little paradise, close to Busan","My favourite day in Busan was spent at this beach. It is a quiet escape from bustling Busan, and on good days you can hang-ten with other local surfers. Very close to the new Lotte Mall and outlets as well as Haedong Yonggung Temple."
"Best Beach in Busan, if...","If you want to go to a beach that isn't quite so crowded, this is the best beach in Busan. Songjeong's off the subway line, so it doesn't get quite the same tourist traffic that Haeundae and Gwanganli do. There are a few coffee shops (Holly's, Angel-in-us) with 5 or so floors each, right up on the beach so you can see everything for kilometers around. There's also a beautiful little park on a peninsula nearby with walking trails and a beautiful pagoda. That being said, there isn't much foreign food in the area (I think I've seen a McDonald's a few blocks away). We ate at a dwegi-gukbap (pork/rice soup) place and loved it. Otherwise, if you're wanting a full meal, be prepared to eat fish."
