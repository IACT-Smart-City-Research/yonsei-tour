A good place to learn more about the Chungbok history,"We decided to drop by the museum after Sangdangseong Fortress. The bus to Sangdangseong Fortress would pass by the museum. Entrance is free.We visited the main exhibition. They displayed history of the region (Chungbok) as early as stone-age. It was a good learning experience to get to know the Korean history and specifically at the Chungbuk region. Gave us a better appreciation of Cheongju as a place.There were a couple of other exhibition halls and special halls for children, which we did not spend much time at."
Cheongju National Museum,"Youn can see lots of relics of the past, Goryeo and Choseon Dynasties in particular. It is very good to pass a day with children."
Good option,There is some special things at this museun. It's a good option to the city.At this moment trere's a special exibition of Joseon Dinasty's.
