"Mostly good, go early! ","An amazing experience in Korea, probably my favourite so far. Seems a bit overcrowded with stores now unfortunately, but still great. My husband said that about 10 years ago it wasn’t so polluted with businesses and you could enjoy affordable souvenirs and food/drinks, not anymore. I wouldn’t bother eating on Nami because the food is double the price of the restaurants right outside of the immigration area. We spent about 3 hours. Best part was riding our bikes around the island in the first hour. We were the first people on the boat and the first to rent bikes and it was AMAZING to go around, take photos and experience it without hundreds of people. We left at 12 and it was flooded with people and the roads were blocked, you could take nice photos or ride a bike freely. Bikes were poor quality. 8,000 for 1 hour, not bad but when one of our bikes seats were broken and the staff wouldn’t change it, it was frustrating. They were old and rusty. "
Beautiful and fascinating view of Nami,Great visit and I would love to go again and have the view to enjoy the whole day. It is just crowded but this is what makes the place very fascinating to spent the time.
Beautiful lane of Korean Pine Trees,Enjoy the beautiful array of Korean pine trees as seen in Korean tele-novela. I would recommend going to Garden of the Morning Calm if you are not a fan of Korean tele-novelas.
Embrace nature,A nice small island of commemorating the famous general Nami. Suggest spend a day here to thoroughly enjoy nature and different elements on the island.
Absolutely fascinating,"I visit the Name Island every year in recent years, usually end Oct./early Nov. This year the summer in Seoul was exceptionally long and there was little rain, hence the ginkgo trees in the city areas, including the Seoul Forest, had not turned yellow. So when I found out Nami Island still had yellow ginkgo trees end of Oct. (normally the ginkgo leaves would have fallen) I decided to go there 3 times over 10 days, to see the changing autumn colours. Fortunately I got some good pictures of chipmunks and of red squirrels. I had not seen a chipmunk at Nami in the past, as they were very shy."
Beautiful Island!,Went on a Monday and it's still very crowded. The autumn atmosphere is very nice with the cool refreshing air and colourful leaves all around. Getting there from Seoul central by metro is a bit of hassle and confusing due to the need to change lines 3 times. Maybe easier to go by shuttle bus.Nice place to visit if you have an extra day in Seoul.
winter sonata,"if you are fans of korean drama winter sonata, then this is the place you shouldnt miss... nami island still remain nature and good for a day trip.."
Okay,"I do not understand Nami Island. Sure, the fall leaves are beautiful, but I do not think it is worth a trip from Seoul. It is crowded beyond belief and is some sort of children's theme park. As an American, I did not notice a general theme or anything of interest to me as an adult. There is just a mismatch of attractions from ostrich to troll sculpture. It was boring, touristy and not a cultural experience for me. I suppose it is interesting for a child."
Superb scenery,Must visit place for tourist who visit Korea for the first time. Romantic Korean drama Winter Sonata made this place famous.
Nami island,"Nami Island is one of the places for Korean drama shooting, on Nami Island it is suitable to travel with a partner or family and suitable to come there during winter"
So beautiful!!!,"I went with a tour bus in October, and it was so nice to see the color leaves and Fall season here!!! The different colors of the leaves really light up Nami Island :). I would highly recommend to come here in the Fall--October to early November. At Nami Island, you can eat and buy souvenirs. There are some snack shops, as well as restaurants on the island. You can also rent a bike for 8,000 won for 1 hour. I did the bike rental, and it was great to ride the bike around Nami Island. You can also see many different statues, and the famous Korea drama statue---Winter Sonata. Many fans from around the world come to Nami Island to see the Winter Sonata statue. It's smaller in person, but it's nice to see if you are a fan of the drama. Overall, Nami Island is such a gorgeous set it with tall trees on the sides of the path. I love it, and sure would visit again in the future :)."
Lovely but very touristy,"Nami island is a must visit place when you’re in Seoul, at least once. Having said that, Nami is so packed with tourists even on weekdays. We went strolling and love seeing the autumn colors. "
Don't Miss To Visit,A fun place to visit for families and solo traveler. A lot of beautiful views. Prepare your cameras for the wonderful moments.
"Petite France, nami island, ganchon rail bike - south korea","I was in nami island, south korea last october. I was a very nice place. Strategic photo spot and i'm very sure those who came there happy when they looked back at their photo. It was autumn season and the leaves is colourful. sometihing that i want to feel before and now i was at the moment.To get there, i bought package from klook. The package include return transport, entrance fee for Petite France, Nami Island & Gangchon Rail Bike. i'll share the pic here. It affordable. The price of the package just RM235 all in. We really enjoy....."
Best Autumn Foliage in Korea,Nami island or Namiseom island is one of the popular tourist location for beautiful autumn foliage just outside the capital of Seoul. You need to take a ferry or opt for the fun way of crossing to Nami island via zip line. Wear comfortable shoes as travelling around the island is by foot. It’s a picturesque getaway so expect many tourist taking their photos. 
Namiseom Beautiful Autumn view- Autumn Sonata,"Since the drama Winter Sonata i'm always wanted to see the beautiful view at Nami Island. Really, it's very beautiful autumn view with the colourful trees. Nice place for photo shoot.I'm booked a local tour at Hotel. The local tour will pick you from/return to Hotel."
Amazing,"Just came back from Nami Island with many amazing colourful leaves, i think its the peak of autumn in Nami "
Outstanding for all ages! ,"What a welcome relief from the congestion of Seoul! Delightful walking trails, pleasant views. Lots of items of visual interests. Autumn colors had started to appear, so the trees were filled with various colors. A ferry takes you from the mainland and takes only a few minutes. There's a hotel on this island, but I can't imagine staying more than a night or two. A great way to spend a day or afternoon. "
Hype - 1/2,"There were lots of glowing reviews for Nami island and so I was really curious. Due to a cancelled appointment, I decided to go to Nami very early, so I can take photos without other people milling around. The island/ferry/entrance gate opens before 8AM. Entrance fee includes round trip boat ride. The transpo from Gapyong station can either be via a bus or taxi. Taxi fare is about 5000 Won, so this deal is not bad, especially if you are travelling with 3 people.My impression is that it is just OK, maybe the hype should be toned down to about half. Because this is a man made/commercialized garden/island guaranteed to UP your instagram game. The only best reason to visit this place is that transportation is very easy from Seoul, cheap train fare and the island can be navigated easily without detailed planning."
An Autumn love story,"Beautiful scenery with activities abound. Best to go in Autumn with a myriad of colors and perfect weather. Spring and winter leaves you with bare trees and icy ground, and summer is just too hot with all green trees. Recommended to eat at the shops outside before taking the ferry for more options. Ferry just a short 5 mins ride. "
Falling in love in Autumn,"Very romantic and you feel the vibe and energy of the place. The island is named after their heroic general. You can spend the whole day walking around, relax in nice cafe"
"Pretty trees and well kept place, but full of tourists","Nami Island is a great place to view fall foliage and it's easy to access via train + ferry. However, it is quite full of tourists and difficult to actually enjoy the nature amid all the noise. There are little shops and eateries as well, which were pricier than the usual prices you'd see in Seoul."
Nami Island self visit from Seoul with family,"Nami Island is indeed a beautiful place. We have been there this October, and the fall, red color leafs on the trees has started, and it is an amazing view. Our small kids had really good time there, running and playing around. But - there are 2 major disadvantages - one, the place is far away from Seoul. We arrived independently, 2 following trains until Gapyeong, than short taxi and the short ferry. Took us more than 2 hours each direction. Another option is simply to take the tour from Seoul, but it cost much more. The second problem is that the place is very, very crowded. Full of tourists and visitors. So, if you live in Europe/North America, and seeing the red colors of the trees in the fall is usual for you, and/or you dislike crowded places - you can easily skip Nami, and spend your extra day in other interesting places in South Korea."
Beautiful Island but touristy,Nami Island is very pretty but touristy. We were there to see autumn leaves and happy to see many squarrels and rabbits running around. Better to join a day tour as it is very chaotic if go by yourself. Restaurants food are not good and is over crowded. Better to pack your own food and have a little picnic in the garden!
Nice Place,We visit here early in the morning to avoid too much visitors. We can enjoy how peace and quiet here is. The tree are beautiful. We were relax by walking and cycling.
Rendevous in Nami Island,Nami Island is a must see place. There's so much to explore and fun things to do like bike around the island. I would not mind going back there during the autumn and spring seasons.
Good place to stop by,It was good place to hang around with friendsSo many beautiful trees Are there and good photo spots tooWell maintained and clean! Recommend to visit early in the morning there are so many ppl
Perfect for family,Quite place during the week. Not sure on week ends. Plenty of activities for kids. Great place in a sunny day.
Nami Island,"We took a day trip from Seoul to visit this Island.Caught the ITX train from Yongsan Station in Seoul to Gaypeong which took just under an hour. Worth planning ahead as tickets seem to sell out quickly, even on off peak times.From Gaypeong station we grabbed a taxi as there were 3 of us it was quicker and cheaper than the bus. There are two options to get to the Island, zip line (family course) zip line (adventure course or the ferry. The zip line adventure course is a steeper run but takes you to another island , you then get a ferry to Nami Island, the zip line family course is slower and more popular, there was a two hour waiting time so we jumped on the ferry which takes about 5 or 10 mins.The Island is beautiful to stroll around, lots of different scenery, lake views, gardens, forests, statues, water falls and fountains, shops, arts and crafts, bars, restaurants and cultural places to enjoy.We were there in autumn so got to see some of the stunning colours. This was a great day trip from Seoul, easily manageable on the ITX and a lovely break from the bustle and hustle of a mega city. An absolute must to see some of the countryside and this amazing park."
Nami Island,The island itself was very nice! Surrounded by trees and nature (aside from the MANY visitors). We went biking and took many pictures. The air was nice and the pathways were wide enough for bikes and cars to travel on.
Wonderful Attraction,"What a great attraction .we have to go by boat to cross the lake.The island is a beutiful,peaceful park and culturally developed with nice streets.A photogenic place calm and quiet place.Must see in korea"
My happy place in South Korea,Ive been in this place twice but i cant go over it. There is something about this place that makes me feel at peace. It must be the leaves.... changing depends on the season.
Beautiful in Spring,"We went during end of April, it was super cold in the morning. We took around 2 hours to cover the whole place. Nothing much actually, it just nice to take a break from the city as we went to Seoul. Everywhere is scenic so everyone pretty much took pictures at every corner with the beautiful flowers blooming. We ate lunch at Asian Family Restaurant Dongmun as it was the only halal restaurant. the food and portion size was pretty good also."
The inyecto but... Tour guy,"Beautiful place to go, even that Was raining, lovely place to go, ferry takes 5 min eather way, a must"
Beautiful in Autumn,I could roam around this place forever. Autumn is the perfect season with all the warm-colored leaves around you.
"Peaceful, but nothing to shout about","Perhapa because we visited in early summer, it wasn't as pretty as it would have been in spring or autumn. It was generally peaceful and relaxing, but nothing in particular was worth shouting about. Once is enough. "
Reliving winter sonata,We booked a day tour with Seoul City Tours which provided transport and a guide. Spent half a day at leisure walking and exploring the island.
Very comfortable and relaxed,My team and I have a happy morning here.A lot of scenes for photoshooting. We rented bikes to go around. It is better to visit this island in October to see yellow leaves.Must try at Seoul.
Very peaceful and relaxing place,Went here on a day trip with a tour for 4 hours. That was not long enough. If you can spend the entire day out there. The nice thing they offer is you can rent Segway type things to cruise around the island on. They were amazing and so much fun. The only downside to the experience was there was so many people because of the holiday
Great place for a day trip out of Seoul,"Nami island is a good choice if you're looking for a day trip to the outskirts of seoul to take a break from shopping downtown. Even though we didn't visit during the best timing (it was drizzling and in between summer and autumn) we still enjoyed strolling around the island. With a toddler in tow (read: slow pace), we managed to cover the island on foot within abt 3 hours, including spending some time at the Swing Cafe (3 min walk from the jetty). Nice cosy place to stop by for coffee and sandwiches. Surprisingly the price in this cafe is very reasonable. I think the island would be even more beautiful during peak seasons like spring or autumn but even during off peak it's still beautiful. Suggest to visit in the morning as the crowd seems to peak in the afternoon."
Best place for sightseeing,The place was beautiful and clean. It was a great place to go with friends and family. There were also a lot of halal restaurant.
Nami Island,"It's the shooting place of the famous Korean Telenovela "" Winter Sonata"". I think we travel there by ferry for less than 10 minutes only. The island is not that big, you can cover it in 2 to 3 hours. It's a well protected and maintained area. We enjoyed taking pictures all over it. We came on summer and it's crowded. Don't miss it!"
Beautiful,"When we visited Nami it was raining. Still the visit was beautiful. Bring raincoats and good walking shoes, best if water proof if visiting during rainy season. "
Very touristy but worth a visit,"This place was packed with people but still worth the visit. The island is very small and half a day is enough to explore the entire island. There are lots of (expensive) food stalls in the island but it is a good location if you want to take photos. There is also an option to take a zip line instead of a ferry going to the island, but it was too cold to do that when we visited. "
Very Touristy nevertheless worth a visit,"There are probably 2 reasons to visit Name Island - One is that you're not Winter Sonata fan but heard of it and two, you're a hardcore Winter Sonata fan... Since Winter Sonata was responsible for the ""Korean Wave"" catapulting Korean drama on the world stage, Name Island has been transformed by tourism. The island is pretty small, but what attracts people here is the beautiful scenery with tons of photo-taking opportunities. Before entering the island, you can see that Name Island is actually a micronation after declaring it a self-governing country in 2006. It even has its own currency but Korean won is widely accepted."
DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR YOUR DAY,"This island must truly be rated mostly by either Koreans or Asians that haven't traveled much of the world. As islands and day trips go, it is below par and barely mediocre. I don't understand how there are so many good reviews. I think I would take the Bronx Zoo over Nami Island"
Waste of time and money,There is nothing to see or do on the island. It is a complete waste of time and money. It takes about 10 minutes to walk the entire island. The shops are all tourist traps with nothing of interest. I can't imagine how it got such good ratings on trip advisor. I wouldn't even give it 1 circle.
DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME,far away from your imagination and far far away from those romantic pics !! the main boulevard always crowded with tourists so its impossible take fancy pics and it looks not so broad as on post .如果你在韓國觀光行程覺得太無聊或真的時間太多那我覺得可以把這個景點排進去.. 否則完全不建議浪費時間來這裡..到處都是觀光客..整個就是人工造景的感覺有點瞎
My Visit to South Korea,"I went on a tour from Osan AB, South Korea. This is a must do if you are in South Korea. I walked the entire day, ate, took many pictures. The restaurants, museums, stores on the Island were great. It was in the winter so the lights were wonderful. The people were great also. Wear good walking shoes."
One of the most beautiful places in all of KOREA!!!,"I was really amazed about Nami Island. I think everything is perfect here. Evn though, it was still summer when we get here, the leaves are starting to paint red and orange, signalling a new season is fast-approaching.Getting here is very easy with a travel agency. Ours we booked it through KKDay."
Wonderful place in an offshore island at Korea,Fantastic place of visiting the natural side of the Korea. Taking the ferry and enjoy a wonderful island place! Feeling relax and a comfortable day.
I was there because of WINTER SONATA,"Booked a day tour in this island and I journeyed the path recalling the drama Winter Sonata. The tour guide said lots of tourists visit the place because of the Kdrama. It's just an island. It's beautiful in any season of the year. We came when it was all green. Lots of movies and dramas were shot here, that's why people come to see the place for itself, including me. My son loved the animals roaming around the place....squirrels, peacocks, birds of all kinds, the ostrich which were enclosed because they ate a cellphone of a tourist one time and more. I loved the way the snowmen were displayed around the area and in languages from all of the world were in signages thoughtout the island. You can spend an hour or two here. Because it was warm, we stayed in a restaurant for a while and Got pizza, pasta and chicken. It tasted great but it was quite expensive. Aside from the drama, the animals, you also get to learn the way of life of Koreans in the olden times. So that's, entertainment, culture and environment. A must place to see while in South Korea."
Nami Island in Spring,"Nami Island showcases the beauty and stillness of nature. Although it's mainly popular among fans of the K-Drama Winter Sonata since the island served as a site of some of its memorable scenes, it's still worth a visit for people who have never even watched a single episode of the show (like me)!My first visit to Nami Island was during one of its hottest summer days so most of its foliage were dried up and bleak in color. Despite that though, the park still exuded an air of majesty and elegance that's still able to capture your attention and appreciation. Fortunately, the scenery became livelier when I visited it last spring. Since the cold from the winter hasn't died down yet, it felt like you were just strolling in an airconditioned indoor garden (similar to the garden exhibits of Singapore) which made the walk around the park comfortable.Hopefully I'd be able to visit the island in Fall and in Winter next time!"
"Nami Island, South Korea","If you love the Winter Sonata, then you should consider this place a part of your South Korea travel list. The island is about 2 hrs away from the city center. The little ""town"" has their own currency called Naminara thus you have to exchange your Korean won upon arrival. In totality, the place is soo picturesque esp the lined up trees where during my visit, we saw around 3 couples having their prenup shoots. It is very much ideal to go during winter time where the ground would be totally snnow white. You would definitely need a day to go around the island. A day tour would also include few hours at Petite France. A real quaint place with lots of beautiful sceneries."
Really had good time,Nami park really nice place to go.. can take a lot of photos.. should try the coffee to keep you warm.. love it
Nice place,"Great place to visit. Suggest not to go during the summer months as it tends to be very hot. Still very nice place though. There are plenty of places to take photos. NAMI is such instagrammable. There were bands playing. And if you get hungry, there are restos and cafes nearby. "
Beautiful island,"I love this island very much. There are beautiful trees, landscape. Anyone is a fan of Winter Sonata and Bae Yong Joon should visit this place once "
One day fun-day with PLIKO,"A nice one-day Chuncheon trip with PLIKO. Especially our experience at Nami Island was very pleasant and witnessed wonderful natural beauty. A very good trip with PLIKO. Thank you, Ms. Gina and Mr. Toni for this wonderful trip."
An island far away from the city ,"Went there as part of the tour that takes me to Nami Island and Little France. It's a long drive from the city. If you enjoy looking at nature, and you have time to relax and walk around. This is the place for you. Nothing much to shop around here. Cafe and restaurants are available. This place is made famous from the Korean drama - winter Sonata. If the tour guide ask you did you watch winter Sonata - say 'no' . The drama is about 20 years ago, and if you watch that drama, he would guess your age "
beautiful trees,"This place can be a bit muddy when it rains. There were lots of tall trees and some animals. There were a number of peacocks and rabbits too. Not much to do here - just roam around and take pictures, there is a playground though."
Wow. Crapola,"I went there with 2 other families after our trip to SeorakSan national park as it was a part of our tour package. What a waste of time. Save yourself some aggravation and money and skip this place. It is a man made island created to separate you from your money and sanity. There is nothing to do except eat horrible, expensive food and buy cheap trinkets marked up to high prices. There is a pen of tired ostriches and rabbits and a so called song museum which is really not a museum. You get there on a ferry and walk around this small crowded islands where you have nothing to do except wait for the ferry to take you back to your tour bus. I bet my house that the tour companies are paid well to stuff people onto the island. All we saw were foreigners who looked bewildered and lost. Skip this place. You will thank me later, I promise. "
Time out from Seoul,"Great to get of Seoul for a few hours, the island means well, but it a tourist destination and little else. Walk away from the crowds and it becomes quiet. Went as part of a KKDay tour which was well worth it for the money."
Rent a bike,"As other reviewers have said, Nami Island is very touristy. However most of the crowds stay on the main route down the middle of the island. I rented a bike and had a lovely time exploring the more scenic and peaceful paths around the edge of the island. There are lots of seats in shady spots where you can sit and contemplate. The bike hire is located on the left, 600m down the main tree lined avenue from the ferry drop off point."
Place totally for sight-seeing,"The place is like a big park to relax and unwind, nothing much to do here except for biking and some water sports if you are interested. To spend 4 hours there is unnecessary, I would suggest 2 hours is enough to explore. Not many restaurants as well, souvenirs are too expensive to purchase. The walking path is full of sand and mud as well. Should also place more benches and bins along the path as we do feel very tired of walking especially for kids, my child had complained of aching feet. Bicycle rental is out of question since it is too expensive and not smooth to bike as too many visitors are walking on the same path. We have to look out for many fast-moving bicycles too while walking which can be dangerous, proper bicycle lanes are recommended to be built to improve the environment for tourists."
Tranquil and Scenic ,"Unfortunately, it rained when I arrived at the island else I would have given it 5*. Nevertheless, Nami Island is still one of the most scenic places I have ever visited. The filming location for the famous Winter Sonata does not disappoint. The gardens are well maintained and it was also a joy to see all the wild animals (squirrels, rabbits) in a large natural environment, compared to some of the other gardens in Korea when they are cooped up in small cages :( We had hoped to zipline down to the island but the weather did not allow for it. Worth the entrance fee!"
Overrated,"We took a tour bus to the island and the travel time was about 2 hours each way. There were some scenic spots for taking photos. Other than that, the island is boring. However, on the day of our visit, it was crowded with many tourists. I felt it was not worth traveling all the way just to visit the island."
Beautiful,"Nami island in summer may not be as beautiful as in other season, but still worth to see. We were planning to spend just an hour there before heading to garden of morning calm, but ended up spending 3 hours and didn’t have time to go anywhere else as we went with a bus shuttle that left at 4.30. nami island is a very serene and beautiful place. there are some small museums or exhibitions there. we particularly liked the one that showed beautiful paintings of andersen fairytales. we found many people bringing their dogs there and we had fun looking at them. there were also a big peacock and a few ostriches. i could only imagine how beautiful this small island in spring or autumn. will definitely visit it again in other seasons if we could. "
Scenic walk,The best way to enter Nami Island is via Zipline. The view is amazing and the ride itself fast yet comfortable.There are lots to see in Nami Island. I've included the island map below for your reference.
"Peaceful, Romantic and Memorable island a","평화롭고, 낭만적이며 인상적인 장소입니다.년간 1500 만 명의 관광객이 방문합니다.무슬림들이 기도할수 있는 작은 기도방, 무솔라, MUSOLA 가 마련되 있습니다.Peaceful, Romantic and Memorable island and famous Korean drama - ""Winter Sonata"" shooting place. over 15 million tourists visit in a year."
Visit with aged parents (wheelchair),"I found Mr Paul Chang’s Korea Wheelchair tour while planning to take my aged parents to Seoul for a short 4-day vacation. My father who is 82 years old has some mobility issues - he is unable to walk far or fast.Mr Chang has demonstrated his experience and dedication when it came to taking care of someone in a wheelchair. He was extremely professional in our opinion.With Mr Chang and his associate - David, my parents could enjoy the beautiful spring weather and sights at Nami Island. Something which would not have been viable for someone with mobility issues.A BIG thank you to Mr Chang (Korea Wheelchair Tour)! "
place is ok but flooded with tourists,you can hardly take nice pictures of the island as you cannot find a quiet place. flooded with tourists even when we head there early in the morning.
Spring at Nami Island ,Nami island during spring season is a must-see for sakura lovers! The island is covered hy luscious pink flowers and the spring breeze is really one for the books! 
Must visit,"If taking a group tour, best to do the nami island - ganchon railway - garden of morning calm combo, skip petit france so you have more time to enjoy nami. Klook is the cheapest tour provider and very well organized. To maximize time, after you get off the 5min ferry to nami, take the unicef train to the farther end of nami island and then walk back to the wharf. There are italian and asian restaurants near the metasequoia tree path. You can also opt to eat the famous dak galbi at the ferry terminal. If you play pokemon go, there are a crazy amount of pokes and poke stops on the island."
Sightseeing,"I went a bit later than usual at about 11am, was a tad crowded but still not so bad. A friend of mine came about 2hrs earlier and she said it was empty. Ferry ticket prices were ok, got abit of a queue but wasnt too long. I took a taxi from Gapyeong station which wasnt too far but i heard there are buses. My friend also said you could purchase tourist package day pass to have bus rides included for all the nearbg attractions, just head over to the tourist counter. Sadly, i didnt get to try it.Behind the ticketing counter they had lockers near the restroom so i could keep my luggage. They have a zipline activity, which is a way for you to enter the island rather than taking the ferry, which seemed really exciting as well. Ferries are relatively frequent so not bad.The island was BEAUTIFUL. It really was a wonder. It was so quite and serene. Even though at the ferry wharf there was a crowd, once insidez everyone will flock to the centre to take photos. So walk off to one of the side roads and it wont be so bad cox ppl tend not to want long walks, which is the sole purpose of this island. The scenery was amazing. Really worth the money. There are quite afew restaurants if you wish to have lunch here as well and i think there are accomodations options if you would wanna stay on the island though not sure how it works. There are some water activities if you wish to take part too."
An island adventure,"I have heard so much about Nami Island. I stayed in seoul lotte city hotel, Myeongdong. Found that there is a subway that i can take to go to the ferry terminal. Going by subway is inexpensive. The station that i need to get to is Gapyeong, green line. I took from sanbong station which took 58 mins, and cost only 2,250 won for 14 stops. From gapyeong, i took taxi which cost about 3,800 won to the ferry terminal. Entrance ticket to Nami Island is 13,000 won round trip. What to see at the island, flowers, trees and nice walking tracks round the island with beautiful landscape. The island was made popular by korean serial: winter sonata. There are also numerous cafe and restuaranrs. "
Crowded Human Beings,Came here in Mid April with crowded tourists ~ It’s a wonderful place to visit for a whole day if there’s not much people around. Wonderful flowers; trees and scenery 
"Nice, too crowded",It's my 5th time visiting Nami but during this trip we didn't walk through the center route instead we walked along the path near the water. It's better because it's not crowded and the view is better too.
Romantic island,"Nice view, clean and many spot for taking instagramble photos...But when it is raining, it is a little bit difficult to find a place for take a sit...W nee walk for a little bit long way for having the main spot"
Not so nice in early April,Leaves were not colorful. Just so so if you would like to walk in a park quietly. There is an ostrich area.
Nami Island - Fantasy island,"This is a gorgeous place whether in any season as the landscape is perfect with well lined trees, lakes and hills all in its surrounding. A bit touristy but worth the time to visit this exotic island while in Korea."
Peaceful and nice place,"Visited twice in mid-December and early May. You need to take a ferry to Nami Island and the ferry island leaves the port at a 10-20 minutes interval. The place is really peaceful and a nice place to take a walk, enjoy the beautiful scenery and enjoy a snack/drink. There are also playgrounds for children to play in. To tour the island, you can either walk on foot, rent bikes or take the train. There are several restaurants and cafes around the island and the price of the food are the same as any other restaurants in Seoul. There is a place that sells really nice hotteok so DO CHECK IT OUT AND TRY IT! I think that 1.5-2 hour is more than sufficient to explore the island. Unless you are there to have a picnic or take a really long stroll. When I went in May, there were flowers blooming and the trees were really beautiful. On the other hand, in December many of the trees were barren as it was too cold."
Fun to explore,"The island may be crowded at times, but it is still worth the visit. You might have to wait for the perfect picture though because a lot of people will be captured in the photo along with you. The place was lovely, and it has different areas which you can explore. I visited this place during the winter a few years ago and it was simply magical. Visited again during the spring this year, and it is still magical. I think it's magical all year around."
Amusement park. Good to visit when it's warm.,"The unusual park that foreign tourists' preference is much bigger than locals'.Even if this is not one of top places to go, locals love it anyway.Great place for 1~2 day trip.- Since this is a private property, it's well-maintained.- I think the admission fee(13,000 won) is affordable for the satisfaction.- From Seoul, taking a shuttle bus at Insadong/Myeongdong/Namdaemun or taking a taxi at Gapyeong Station is recommended. The distance from Gapyeong Station to Gapyeongnaru Ferry Terminal is almost half an hour to walk.- There is the street of dakgalbi(spicy fried chicken ribs) before the ferry terminal. Places to have lunch. There are restaurants and snacks on the island, too.- Good to connect a visit with other places in Gapyeong-gun. There's a city tour bus as well.- The best export of Gapyeong-gun is a pine nut. Try it if you have a chance.- There are pensions on the island. Find places for families who enjoy the island overnight.- Comparing to the size and visitors, there were quite few stewards and help centers."
lovely place to spend the day,"beautiful paths, gardens, statues, cafés, alleys of beautiful trees, quiet places to sit. This was my first visit to South Korea and I loved to watch local families enjoy this island with their children. The ferry ride is fast and well organized."
Nice place to make a day trip,Good to put aside a full day for this interesting place. Take a slow walk along the pathway and head back to jetty by the shoreline
Beautiful island,"This is a small island famous from the movie Winter Sonata. I know about the movie and have chance to visit the island in my trip to Korea.Nice park to see, walking along the bank of river. Good place to have beautiful photos"
Nothing much,Have been to Nami Island some years ago. Second time here. The place hasn’t change much. We prefer the garden of the morning calm in Spring. Believe this place will be prettier in Winter. 
Spectaculars in all seasons,"It took us 1hour 30 mins to get to Nami Island by taxi from Seoul. My daughters insisted to wait for the zip line for 1hour and 30 min to get to the island and enjoyed it very much . I took the ferry. I loved the Island. I loved the sound of birds. I closed my eyes beside the beach and listened to the sound of nature. Very relaxing, very calming. I walked all the way around the island. I took nice photos. Had lunch in the Italian resturant and bought some souvenirs. People were riding bicycles which was fun. I hope to visit the island again in fall."
Coping up with the changes ,"I have visited this tourist attraction several times. Admired how this has coped up with the defining changes in society. Popularised by the Tv show Winter Sonata it is one that had started the vaunted Korean wave. Frequented not only by tourists but also by locals , lots of activities are available. And you can spend the whole day here lazing away. Even though you need to ride a ferry to access the island , it is not really a hassle doing it. Highly recommended. By the way , getting to know it’s history would be a nice accompaniment. Some photos I am posting. "
Stunning..like a fairytale,"Nami island has to be one of the most beautiful places I've ever visited in my 30 years alive. It's picturesque walk ways under giant lights and big trees to it's scenic water edge that mirrors it's surround landscapes, its undoubtedly a sight to behold.There are many yummy restaurants and snacks to be consumed.  Bicycles and boats that can be hired.Trust me please visit. "
Nothing special in early April,It's a pleasant way to while away the day but too far to travel from Seoul to make it worth the while during early April. Especially if you're not a Winter Sonata fan. We wanted to go to The Garden of Morning Calm which is not too far away but spring hasn't really arrived in the first week so we decided not to go. 
To see then place in Korean Drama,"Get to know Nami Islands is because of a Korean Drama name “Winter Sonata”. but when visit, get to know that there is more in Nami Islands. Nami Island has a very nice walking riverside if you need a silent moment. a big field accompany with a line of trees make you like it much!another thing i would like to tell, there is a Unicef office in Nami Island. please pay a visit if you go to Nami Island!you can also rent a bike to ride around the islands. i do not do so because i would like to feel the island by walk."
Visit in Mid-April,Mid April is the best time to visit. If you go there before mid April there will just be barren tree and everything is brown. There are many Korean movies shot in Nami. It's worth a trip. But if you love flowers go in mid-April.
Great place to spend half to a full day especially if you have kids.,"A fabulous place to hop over on a ferry and walk around for a few hours.There are squirrels,ostrich,plenty of birds and chipmonks. Plenty of cafe and food places.A waterpark which would be great in the summer. Lots of ponds with tadpoles.Kids playgrounds to keep them happy.A zip line into the park for the brave.44000 won will get you in.Admission was 13000 for adults for ferry etc.10 ferry ride gets you onto the Island.Ferry's go back and forward all day."
Vacation it is,I travelled along with my wife to Nami Island. The place was romantic. It is like we are in Korean-novela.
Shooting place,Feels like I was part of winter sonata. Though some flowers has not yet bloom I witness the beauty if nature in this place.
A good palce for sigh seeing with the perfect time,For people who like nature and a picnic maybe it is a food place. But the place needed the perfect time to visit. I went to it at the end of March and and the place was dead.No green at the place nor flower. I think visiting it at the middle or the end of April may be the best where the sakura tree bloom in Seoul. 
Seoul Searching..,"I love the weather now, perfect for Nami Island travel. The place is awesome, with lots of spots for a photo, all perfect backgrounds. It may be the onset of Spring but sadly there aren't much cherry blossoms in bloom yet. It would have been more perfect but still, the place is spectacular. I don't remember finding a gift shop in the island tho.. The island is child friendly, there are playgrounds for them to enjoy and spend their time while their folks are busy taking photos I love the scenery, nature at its finest ❤"
Too early in April ,No leaves on the trees so everything looked a bit bleak. Lots of pleasant trails to stroll but lots of tourists as well. Yummy snacks and things to keep you busy for an hour or two. 
Breathtakingly Beautiful in Autumn!,"We went to Nami Island during Autumn and it was really beautiful. The Ferry Ride was ok but it was really packed. The colours of the trees were so beautiful and rich, the air was cold and crisp and so refreshing. The place should be better maintained since there are so many visitors."
Not worth the effort!!,"Jam packed with people.Efficient Ferry.Beautiful park with photo bombers everywhere.The working staff look disinterested, bored, as if we owe them a living.It was beautiful but expensive and time consuming to reach via seoul. Spend your time elsewhere. Unless you really wanna tick this in your box. "
Awesome ,"Didn’t get to zip line across to nami island due to the long queue but the ferry ride was just fine, with a short frequency of about every 10-15mins. Autumn in Nami island was amazing, with maple trees abundant and autumn colors filing the entire place. I loved every bit of it, coupled with the nice chilly weather and wish we had stayed longer so I could cover the entire island with a bike ride, chill and soak in all the view. But nonetheless, it’s definitely worth going during autumn season! "
Beautiful Island,Walked all the way till the end of the island and it was worth it. Amazing view and will definitely come back.
Painting brought to life! Bursts of fiery red and vibrant yellow in the Autumn. Amazing place!,"Went there in Autumn with my family. It was our first time ever setting foot in Korea and experiencing Autumn and men did it blew our minds. The place was really really beautiful and magical. It was like a painting bursting with colors and the temperature is really cold. Although coming from a tropical country we absolutely loved the weather! We took a ferry boat going to the island. But there is also an option to zipline your way towards the island. The place is a great trail for walking because every corner of it is amazing! Animals freely roam the place. We also found a peacock on a tree which we found peculiar but cute. The gingko, sequoia, and japanese maple lanes are just breathtaking. If you're not the walker-type or your'e not much into walking, sitting there and taking in the view would be the another best option. Going hungry or thirsty would never be a problem also because the place is also filled with cafe's and restaurants. There is also a store that sells gloves and warmers. Absolutely love the place and would always love to comeback!"
Interesting To Do in Nami Island,"This island somehow reminds me of Gili Trawangan in Lombok, Indonesia. In the middle of serene, no vehicles, so peaceful. Two options for amuse yourself circling the place; either cycling or walking. I chose the second option and enjoying myself very much. Listen to sound of wind and feel the breeze. Well, you know Korea, even it's spring but the temperature still low. A cup of hot chocolate make my half day in Nami so perfect. It's very relaxing and I could feel myself recharging from the routine. That's how Nami to me."
So beautiful and green!,"Me and my friends got there pretty late because we didnt take the ktx, and went out a little more late than expected. So we didn't get to explore much of Nami Island, however, it was still an amazing experience. There were chipmunks and bunnies too! If you are planning to go there make sure to wake up super early and buy ktx tickets in advance so you get to spend as much time there as possible. also, We got there by boat but theres also the option to go on a zipline. I'm not sure whether you can rent a place there but I saw some small buildings that looked like rented apartments or something so make sure to look into that!"
Nice place for selfie,Nami is not a natural island but the environment was fine and many corner for taking photos to check in. I think it was like a big park.
Visit either by fall or winter,Visiting here by fall or winter will ensure you get the best colors for Nami Island.Expect hordes of tourists though.The entire island is very walkable and it will be best to avoid the crowd at the periphery of the island.
Beautiful ,I really love the view in Nami Island. It was so stunning and you can do a lot of stuff in there and one of it is you can rent a bike and cycling around the island 
Worn out place,"It's not very well maintaine, things are falling apart.. it's 17 years since the famous drama which turns this place into a tourist attraction.Now it's quiet and peaceful, and that's about it.. not sure if it's worth travelling such distance for a place like this"
Disappointing,Not worth the trip.There isn't anything particular about this island except that its crowded. Unless sentiment from winter sonata adds extra personal value.. One of the last most visited places I would recommend a friend or family travelling from abroad.
Beautiful golden leaves in Autumn,"It's really a beautiful place to visit in Autumn, except it's super crowded along their signature tree lanes. A small island to spend 1,2 hours to half a day, depending on your travel preferences. For what you can do and eat on Nami Island, search keywords: ""joogostyle tag Nami Island"""
Day Trip from Seoul in autumn,"Amazingly beautiful autumn colors are great pleasure to our vision sensation, even on a rainy day. Advisable to arrive and start your visit before noon so as to have sufficient hours for lunch and sight seeing, before the big rush and massive queues (or no queue because just massive crowd moving on to) for returning ferries."
Worthy,"Nami Island is situated about 90 minutes train-ride away from Seoul, tour bus ride from the Gapyeong station and ferry ride from the terminal. It is certainly worth the travel.Beautiful landscaping with so many photo taking opportunities. However they need to station more staff to help tourists with information and directions.Trip to Korea will not complete without visiting Nami Island."
Idyllic,"The tranquil atmosphere in Nami Island combined with its pristine beauty make it a must on any trip to Korea. Just a quick bus ride away from Seoul, the island has plenty to offer. While the island is most popular for being the shooting location of the hit Kdrama Winter Sonata, there is plenty more to do and see. Gardens, groves and pathways abound, as well as food shops/restaurants and souvenir shops. Many spots are perfect for photos. The farther you go inside the island, the less people/tourists will be. A tram and tour bus going around the island are available for those who do not like to walk. Bicycle rental is also an option. The short ferry ride to and from the island also allows for some sight-seeing along the coast."
Mémorable ,"Nami island belong to an individual who was a bank employee and with his retirement fund, own it. It was meant to be his retirement retreat and family resort but change of heart, I guess, it was open to students for holiday bbq n camps before it became commercialise. Prior to that with the help of his good friend, landscape developer, each year, it was groomed towards natures beauty. Tranquil if not for the crowd. "
AMAZING VIEW,"I visit during winter, and there is a snow slope they built for visitor and its all free. You can play the snow sled and take picture. The staff is very helpfull."
Nami Island visit during March (Spring Festival period),"Nami Island is a must visit place if you are visiting Korea. I would venture to say that even if you are just touring Icheon or Seoul. A trip to Gangwon to visit Nami Island is worth it. We visited for only a couple of hours (whole afternoon) so it is not a full experience I'm sharing here.SOME NOTES: We visited as a family and as part of a tour group we were definitely milling around a few hundred people on the island. We visited during spring, it is the best time in my opinion.LIKE!1). Take in the scenery - The main focus of Nami Island is how well the place is maintained. I like the beautiful landscaping or how the different trees, grass, and flowers are blended to give you a serene and picture/instragrammable place. We even chanced upon a group who were almost finished doing a nuptial photoshoot.2). Ferry-trip - I liked how the ferry had a regular transit to-and-from the island. You didn't really have to wait very long to get on a ferry. Plus, the trip was pleasant as you get to see different places within the vicinity before landing on the island. It was also very clean and you really didn't have any worry during the short trip.3). Lots of shops and restaurants - They had different shops offering souvenir items of all kinds/types/sizes, some like the more modern t-shirts, trinkets, toys. And the more traditional ones like hand-carved / wood-crafted items. You won't get hungry here as there are several shops where you can get food from finger foods to full restaurants.CAN BE IMPROVED 1). Tourism / Promotion - I liked the novelty of Nami Island having its own 'government' and currency but didn't really get to experience what the goal of having this was. It was just a curious aspect of the visit for me. Maybe have something more geared towards tourist who just visits the island once and for a few hours only.2). Long ferry trip - I'm not sure if it was intentional, but I felt the ferry was traveling really slow. I didn't believe such a short trip would take more than 30mins (actual travel time only) to get to the island.3). Lack of personnel - I noticed during our visit that not all the shops were open, and there were hardly any person whom tourists can approach if they had questions or concerns. I just saw the maintenance people (like gardeners and attendants) pruning the grass and cleaning the fields. It would help if they had a couple of people dedicated to helping tourists with any questions or help they needed.CONCLUSION:People have different preferences. Some people like the festive atmosphere of crowds in a place like Nami Island, some would prefer a more serene moment in this place. Definitely visit during spring, it is the best time in my opinion, but be prepared for the tourist crowd during spring. It's their busiest season. "
Wonder walk,Walked thru Nami Island and amazed with the natural scenery and plentiful man made structure and scalpture. Truely wonderful
Unforgettable Memories,The island have it own attraction withe a beautiful view. This is must visit place if you travel to Seoul
Good scene,We really enjoy the place although long way to reach there. We took a lot of photo. The kids really enjoy the place and the scene like in the movie 
Fascinating Island,Nami Island. A fascinating island. Before you can go to the isalnd you need to ride a boat across to the island. The boat has no seats but dont worry it took few minutes to cross into the island. We go there in winter and it was very cold and lots of tourists.The island is famous for some korean movies location. there a lot of different koreans tree there but during winter all leaves are gone. There are food stalls inside the nami island and souvenir shops as well. you can even rent a bike to roam around the nami island.
Fascinating scene,"Autumn in Nami Island is lovelier during this season!  Imagine to see the abundance of yellow, orange and red hues dominating what was once a lush green flora!  The scene is stunning and magical."
Our first trip..,"This is our first trip together, the island was good not that crowded and food was ok too.. rather cold for December."
Best shot in autumn!,"I went there in both winter and autumn... different beauty of island. If you are sonata fans, recommend to visit in autumn when we can see beauty of leaves. "
Zipline is worth it,"At first I thought nobody ziplines to Nami Island in winter so I booked ferry tickets.On the ferry ride to the island we saw 2 people ziplining. So we took the ferry back and ziplined there again.The zipline ends at a different spot from where the ferry docks on the island. It ends along a scenic cycling route.The zipline ticket counter is different from the ferry ticket counter. It is located in the zipline tower.We took the lift up, the crew set up the equipment, and we were off in about 5 minutes.I thought we could buy photos at the end but I didn't dare to ask the crew. Maybe I should've asked."

White Nami Island!,"A day walk in Nami Island covering in snow, greeted by the chilly wind , warming up ourselves at the firewood eating hot sausages/ snack, and ice cream are great experience! Not forgetting all the camera worthy sceneries!"
Fun but without the snow,Really looking forward to the visit but did not get the white snow. Either snow has come and gone or not there yet.A lot of other activities to pass your time there.
Not just for Winter Sonata fans,"I booked a tour to Nami Island + Garden of Morning Calm on Klook. During the tour, I learned that Nami Island was named after General Nami who died at the age of 26 and was buried on the island. It took around 1 hour plus by bus from Seoul to Nami. Once you reach the jetty, you can choose either to take a ferry or zipline (at additional charge) to the island. Attractions on the island include General Nami tomb, Elysian waterfall, Winter Sonata filming location, Winter Sonata statue, and Winter Sonata first kiss. I rented a bike and managed to cover the entire island in less than an hour. For Muslim travellers, there's a halal restaurant on the island (Asian Cuisine Restaurant). The restaurant menu includes halal Korean dishes such as bulgogi and dakgalbi."
Nice!,Went to nami island during winter but still not snowing yet but really really cold. Small cute island with loads of area for a good photography session.
Crowded but worth the shot in autumn!,"I Intentionally skipped this tourist spot the first time I went in korea. because I’ve read lots of reviews that this place is always crowded. I give it a try in this next visit to feed my curiosity. To skip the hassle by commuting, we rent a car, gladly my cousin’s husband is a korean and have access where to rent a car from locals (because renting a car from a company is very expensive) and nami island is very far from Seoul. (Literally) anyway, Line for a ferry was too long but the view was fascinating specially in autumn. When we arrived, it’s indeed very crowded! You can’t even find a good spot to get a clear shots with the famous ginkgo trees! (If I’m not mistaken) But nevertheless we did our best to have our own “famous photo”. I think best to visit here is autumn and winter. We came a little early in October as we didn’t get the chance to witness the awesome autumn of this place. I don’t recommend this for summer, it will be look pretty plain and I think a waste of money and time. But I recommend this place to those who will visit alone or with friends to join a tour package, The money will be worth it. Spent 2 1/2 hour here with picture taking and eating, (food here is expensive for average consumers) we enjoyed Italian pizza! then we proceed to petite France and garden of morning calm. This three attractions are very far from each other, like 45-1 hour away each! so renting a car was a good idea in our case. All in all still worth the shot! Just come very early. I will visit this exactly in autumn next time by mid October to early November, and for winter. "
A fitting tribute to a great warrior,"A must place of visit in Seoul and if you’re a nature lover, never miss it. One of the main tourist attractions in Seoul ,this place boosts of large foot falls in all seasons. The island has a entirely different look during each season making it very popular among the tourists and also the local population. During spring one can see the trees blooming with flowers and many visit this place to enjoy the snow draped trees in winter.Named over General Nami who was known for his courage and died at an young age of 26, this island has a swimming pool, a large open grass field in the middle, water boats, water skiing, roller skating ring, a hotel /resort and a many cafes and restaurants. There is also a bicycle rental service ,which is very popular used by many to go around this island which is covers a circumference of around 5 kms.This island can be reached thru a ferry or thru a zip line. But to return back to the main land, one needs to opt for ferry only.This place is around 65 kms from the Seoul and based on the time you can spare, the visit can be around 4-5 hours to full day.One can also reach this place very early morning and then club the visit other attraction nearby. The best option would be to opt for a room at the Island hotel or resort and enjoy the stay.If you are a small family of 3-4, then hire a taxi and if you are a group of 7-8 members, then hiring a Jumbo taxi would be the best option. For individuals and on visiting on limited budget ,there are Shuttle bus services from Insadong, Mandaemun and Myeongdong or one can take a train and get down at Gapyeong Station which is around 2 kms away from Nami Island."
private trip to mount sorak and nami island,"The trip was super fun and relax. The tour guide was so kind, humorous and friendly, he was good at explaining the attractions and it kept our attention during the trip. Mount Sorak is a place that must visit in Korea because it has a beautiful view and it gives us a different view of Korea. Name island is also an interesting place for tourist to visit, it has many games and much more to explore in this island. lastly, I appreciated the tour guide's used of language and he really did a good job and being active throughout the trip. Thanks a lot and we really did have fun in this trip!"
Not enough time!!!!,"We follow the shuttle with island ticket tour from Seoul. Journey starts from 10:30 from Seoul. It’s not that far, about an hour. The place is just too pretty. I’m a guy that likes to soak in as much as possible, and not just rushing to take all the best location shots. so i didn’t manage to finish the place as I would’ve like. Since it was winter there’s man made wintery attractions like sledding which my daughter enjoy very much and decided to just park herself in the sledding park, in the end we did half the island as the tour bus leaves at 4pm.I suppose the best way to enjoy this island is either drive in as early as possible, if you rent a car or perhaps arrange to stay a night either on the island or at the port. It’s worth it. "
December visit. ,"Visited this island as part of a tour package and spent about 2.5 hours here. The ambient temperature was around -3deg, which makes the hot drinks and snacks a wonderful treat. Was told this location was used for the Korean drama - Winter Sonata. Beautiful scenery and a tranquil calm makes this place attractive and worthy of photos"
A Visit to Nami Island,"This island is a great place to visit at least for once. Despite Nami Island is not a very big place, however, it is very cosy and welcoming to tourist and visitors who would like to experience something different and loving couples. For adventurous people, one can visit the island via zip wire instead of ferry. It is quite challenging and exciting. "
Unimaginable beautiful view,"Very nice place to visit. The pictures say everything. The ticket for one person is around 52000 Korean Won. The cruise will take to the island. There is also a zip lining which can directly take to the island. The best time to visit this place is at the end of October and starting the week of November. If you have DSLR then you can have nice photography. It's a romantic destination. The restaurants are available. If you are a vegetarian, then you can have vegetarian pizza. The restroom is also there. You can enjoy high-speed boat ride by spending some money."
Worth a visit !!,We had an organized tour that took us to Nami Island which is almost 2 hours from Seoul. Probable winter isn't the right season to visit the Island and if it was autumn or Spring we would have truly enjoyed the beautiful island with greenery all around. In December it was too cold. A walk through the island and around the edge of the lake was nice and refreshing. There are lots of restaurants and Cafe to take care of your hunger and you can easily spend 3/4 hours in the Island. Worth the visit.
Nice stroll around the island,"it is quite far from Seoul, you have to take ITX to Gapyeong Station, the journey took about 1 hour+ After reaching Gapyeong Station, you need to take another bus which is 1-time fees and allow you to visit multi places.After dropping at nami island station, you need to buy another ticket to take short ferry ride (which is the entry fees). of course there are some restaurant for you to take a break before taking the ferry to the island.Alternatively, you can take this zipline shooting you through the mid-air directly to nami island, which cost a little bit more money.Nami island is great, I visited in September, weather was cooler and nice walking around the island though there's not much of autumn activities to do other than buggy car around the island and scenery photo taking..."
Probably best during spring or autumn ,"Winter may be too harsh for one to truly appreciate this place. I will suspect spring or autumn with the leaves of different shades to be more magical. We took the long way of hopping from one subway line to the next to reach Gapyeong. On the way back, it was much faster in the ITX line from Gapyeong to Yongsan. "
Getting in touch with nature,"Our tour guide was right: Nami Island is enjoyed by walking and getting in touch with nature. Our family walked in the freezing cold (we visited during a harsh winter) and enjoyed every bit of it. Bonfires were in place at certain points to kerp you warm. There is a troll bridge, snowboarding area, an ostrich pen, (frozen ice) fountains and coffee shops and restaurants that offer a warm break."
Very cold and nice scenery ,"Recommended for half day trip to this beautiful place.Entry and ferry ticket for adult costs 13,000 won and 10,000 won for youths.Lots of Muslim friendly restaurants and rest place to chill and relax.Cheers"
"Only 60+ kms from Seoul, and worth a visit","My partner and I were lucky to visit Namiseom (or more commonly Nami) Island at the beginning of November, right in the middle of the Autumn fall period. As a result we not only got to experience the island itself, but the brilliant autumnal colours of the leaves on the trees, from brilliant red, to bright orange and outstanding yellows.The island is actually in the middle of a lake, but has no bridges to it, even though only about 200 metres from the surrounds of the lake. All travel to the island is via one, of a number of, boats that provide the traverse experience.There is much to see on this narrow, and longish island. Plenty of accommodation facilities, restaurants, food outlets etc., although eating on the island can be somewhat expensive. There are plenty of easy walks around the island, with so many beautiful views. It is a VERY easy walk because the entire island is almost totally flat, with no hills or mountains. A reasonably casual walk around the entire island can take you between 1 - 1.5 hours, but by its very nature and design, you can cut short your walk at almost anytime, and return back to the boat port via another easy path. Well worth a visit.And if you have the option, try to do it in Autumn fall time (end of October and first two weeks of November) when you will have the added bonus of the beautiful colours adding to the impressive views that the island has to offer."
nice island visit,"First time there, and everything was as expected. boat ride, many beautiful place for pictures，a number of street food stores. can easily spend 3-4 hours. If going near lunch time, restaurants could be crowded, so consider packing own food. while you are there definitely go for the rail bike - Super fun. There are few options, so be sure to clarify locations before booking (booking highly recommended) in case arriving at the wrong locations. "
Beautiful island ,"Beautiful island. Only 4 restaurants avail. One of the restaurants, the Korean cuisine needs to order compulsory two sets for each selection. Wierd rules. Suggest to get your food at the harbour before or after the island tour at the jetty. "
Nice Natural Setting,"I took an ITX from Wangsimni, and had to change trains at Cheongnyangngi; if not sure, ask the officials around and they will direct you to the right trains. Alight at Gapyeong. If you have purchased a single trip train ticket, be sure to get your deposit of 500 won back. Just insert your card into refund deposit machine to get your money back.Across the road from the Gapyeong train station is the bus stop. We waited for a long time for the shuttle bus to Nami Island Ferry Point. In the end, we took a taxi. The standard fare was 6,000 won per taxi. Nami Island is known for its scenery, its shooting location for Winter Sonata at the Metasequoia lane. Enjoy the stroll amidst the natural setting. :))"
S C E N I C,Nami Island is a must visit when in Korea ~ The whole island is a photo shoot location! 3 hours definitely not enough for those who loves posing for pictures xD There was a dog gallery; with cute doggy pictures and even displaying fake doggos that looked so real. Downside was too many people! Difficult to get the amazing pics you see online as there were photobombers everywhere.
"Nice Place to Visit, Expensive Food and Coffee","It's a great place to walk around, take pictures, and just generally relax and take in the fresh air and scenery. When we went it was nearing winter so the trees were mostly bare. The food in the restaurants and the coffee were a lot pricier so I suggest getting your lunch and coffee before getting on the ferry into Nami Island. If you're in a tour group and you need to get back at a certain time, make sure to catch the ferry 30 minutes before your scheduled departure because there's a lot of people waiting to get back too."
"Beautiful Island, but it is not a must visit place","Nami Island is located around 60 kms away from Seoul. We took ITX from Yongsan Station to Gapyeong Station, then took bus to the island using transit bus. Quite easy to access.The island's main attraction is several lanes with different types of trees line along the lanes. Besides, there are several man-made structures, a few rows of shops, and an ostrich farm on the island.For K-drama follower, the island means a lot as a filming location of several k-drama. Well, the one that brought the island to the eyes of the world is Winter Sonata. The filming locations were marked with special signage on the island.We visited the island during autumn. It was really beautiful with endless stretch of autumn-coloured foliage. We spent around 2 hours 30 minutes on the island. Food and beverages were available (the price was high), and there were plenty of resting area.We enjoyed walking around the island. Anyway, we would suggest renting a bicycle might be a better way of touring around the island. Please read our blog to know more about how to travel from Seoul to the island via public transport. More beautiful photos are available as well.Is it a must-visit place nearby Seoul? We would say- no. However, it is a place that good-to-go, if you have a whole day to spare. By the way, instead of going to Petite French or the Garden of the Morning Calm, pay a short visit to Gapyeong Town and take a ride on Rail Park are great options as well."
Gloomy trees yet refreshing,"We took subway to Yongsan station & catch ITX train to Gapyeong about an hr ride. Exit Gapyeong station, there's tourist information counter, get bus time table & q for bus. Pay cash to bus driver 6000 won when board the bus, u can hope up & down several attractions with the ticket so don lose it!Our first stop Nami. Alight bus, walk about 8min to reach the wharf, no q, get ticket to Nami (include ferry both ways), it's not crowded, board ferry but waited for a while for it to move guess they try to fill up as many pple as possible for each ride.Nami to me is nothing much interesting (guess autumn would be lovely but will be flooded with pple & too noisy). Nice to take photo with rows of trees without leaves, feel gloomy yet refreshing.Had lunch in korean BBQ restaurant (so so) & continue explore the area, about 3 hr include lunch is enough for us. Tried the red bean sticky cake near the fire place, warm & nice.Nice to have fire place around to beat the cold, was -5Board the return ferry, waited quite a while again before it move as they try to fill up with pple before depart. At the end miss the bus by about 8min to Petite France & took taxi there cost about 18K won Ferry to Nami island is fast like less than 10min, but waiting time on the ferry is rather long, hope they can improve on this for those who come by shuttle bus & need to be on time for the bus for next destination."
Beauty of Nami,Beautiful .. Before i go there. Hmm.. How excited i am.. Then when im here...woww.. Yesss for sure i will came again..one fine day. 
Beautiful! But....,The place is beautiful as advertised. But too crowded. One can’t really enjoy the place as some tourists are so noisy.
Not for me!,"Friend picked me up at airport, and showed me around his home area.Nami Island, a world heritage site( ?) a 1 1/2 hour drive way from the city.People everywhere come to this site.i was told that A NUMBER OF Japanese/photographers fly in specially to photograph the Avenue of Gingko trees.To me it’s just a bit of an island with some trees,flowers, rocks, Grass shrubs... I was bored,it wasn’t my scene, but, I feigned interest to show that I appreciated his efforts!!!!But the many who were there, WERE NOT LIKE ME!!!! I have NO APPRECIATION for land scenes, for the MONA LISA etc etc..I am an ignorant, crass, blind non art seeing person!!To me, the climax of the journey, was the two matching rows of Ginkgo trees.. they were straight!!!!!I personally would not waste my time to come here !But, my friend was gushing with pride and enthusiasm!So, how can this ignoramus, critique a World Heritage Site??With a hand on my heart,and OPEN EYES CLOSED... it’s autumn here now. Fallen leaves cover the ground around the trees, whose trunks are now winter wrapped in hessian cloth, and Xmas lighting are being fixed along the branches.A 5min ferry ride to access this island, in the middle of a river."
A must visit for all first timers.,"A beautiful island, famous as the backdrop for Korean Drama Winter Sonata. Nothing much really but a nice getaway. For thrill-seekers, try ziplining to the island. I was too chicken and besides the weather was too cold. Easy to get to. Don't bother to go on your own, although you can. Save the hassle. There are plenty of tours which you can book. Mine was only SGD47, from Klook, to Nami and Petite France from 8am to 4.30pm. The guide was so experienced that we knew the must-see and where the poster perfect shots should be taken."
Beautiful Island,"Beautiful, peaceful island in Korea. Came here during end November, nice place for taking beautiful photos. Booked my round trip transport traveling with coach via Klook with pick up from Myeongdong. Journey takes around 1.5 hours drive. Upon reaching, you will need to take a ferry which will take you to Nami Island. Island is full of tourists, many of them so it’s quite hard to take pictures with clear background. All the leaves have fallen hence most trees are bare. However scenery is still beautiful. You will come across to wild Ostrich area too. There are a number of restaurants around too. Definitely worth a trip here if you are a tourist. "
A beautiful island,I loved the place. Establishments there are pretty over-priced but I understand that it's a tourist spot. But seeing the different views and locations of the island was really breathtaking.
Great Visit,It was nice visiting the island. it's just a short ferry trip there. everything there was so clean and well maintain. My kids like the island so much.
Beautiful!,We went there in autumn and it was beautiful. Well preserved and maintained. The fall foliage against the blue sky is stunning.
Beautiful Island,"This island is famous for its beautiful greens and being a popular location for filming of various Korean Dramas. There are two ways to get here, one being a ticketed ferry ride and another being a one-way zip-line experience into the island itself. Would recommend the zip-line if budget is not tight! Otherwise, the island has wonderful scenery and should not be missed!"
Nice scenery,"Went during late autumn/ early winter and the view was breathtaking. Different kinds of tall trees are planted around the island. Some spots were apparently the filming locations for Winter Sonata so if you are into that, this might be a spot not to be missed."
Island of seasons,"From Gapyeong station take the city bus unli at 6000Won per person. They will give you a table of their schedule pick up and drop off. Interval between buses is 10 to 20 mins so you can time your stops in order to make it back on time.All foods or maybe 95% in the island costs 3000Won... bbq, sausages, ice cream... but nothing we ate was spectacular. All was just enough to keep your stomach full...Try to schedule an entire day so you can enjoy the place. It's worth every minute of your stroll.Tip: book your return ticket at Gapyeong station with reserved seats as soon as you arrive. MAKE SURE you DON'T MISS IT! IF you VISIT IN THE COLDER MONTHS, THIS PLACE WILL BE MUCH COOLER EVEN :)"
Winter sonata,"This place is famous for winter sonata... if you’re hallyu you must visit here... there’s boat that take you to Nami island... this place called naminara republic by local korean... very very good place... there’s 1 tomb for general nami on Nami so you must be careful (location before wood road nearby water, you can see on nami map)..."
Icon of Chuncheon,It is a very famous site in Chuncheon. Travelers should take ship to this island where have many restaurants and walking paths. It would be very beautiful with different colors of maple leaves In Autumn.
Another spot spoiled by overtourism ,"Excellent little island with great natural surroundings and peaceful atmosphere all year round. The trees were already bald when we visited in end Nov but yet the weather was just nice. About 3-4 hours is enough to walk around this island. But tourists are everywhere and IMHO it really spoils the peace and tranquility of this area. Huge huge loads of tourists come here everyday. To get here from Seoul maybe a little bit tricky. We took a normal train to Oksu and direct ITX train to Gapyeong station. This direct ITX train can be taken from 1-2 other stations and it cuts the journey to 1hour. You need to pre-book this ride online both ways. If not, one way using normal train journey is about 2 hours from Myeongdong. Alternatively there are direct buses to & from myeongdong. We just did the normal train as we didn't pre-book anything "
A beautiful place for autumn,"If you have been a fan of love-themed Korean dramas, this is the place to visit. Lovely for couples as the surroundings are really romantic and beautiful. Great for rekindling the love of those who have been jaded through many years of marriage. Here is also where you will be able to capture many a beautiful pictures to add to your library of beautiful places to visit. It is also convenient as good, clean toilets are everywhere and cafes as well as snack counters are plenty. There are regular schedules for the short boat trips from the mainland.There is also an interesting origin and history to Nami Island."
Getaway from the city :D,"As an avid traveler, people always mentioned about Nami Island, and my first thought is that its a tourist trap! Yes it is, but i find it to be quite a beautiful place most especially in the winter! We were actually lucky to catch the first snowfall, although we originally went there for autumn. Play in an actual winter wonderland. There is quite a lot of people, but they come and go due to tour group schedules so you'll be able to find empty places for pics! P.s. Making a snowman is not that easy. Lol"
"Very colorful in autumn, but crowded","I visited Nami Island several times. I was there again towards the end of Oct., 2018 (Sunday); it was a disappointment as It was raining. Unless you have never been to Nami Island before, try your very best not to go there on a rainy weekend. To make up for the loss, I re-visited it a week later, in early Nov. It was sunny but the approaching road was heavily congested. The maple and ginkgo trees seemed to have lost much of their glamour over the week. Nevertheless Nami Island is one of the best places to visit when you are in Seoul; it is so relaxing. I pre-booked online a return trip on the official Nami shuttle bus (Insa-dong -- Nami Island), via Trazy. It was an excellent arrangement. (Although the bus departs at 0930 from Insa-dong and at 1600 from Nami, the nett duration for walking around is perhaps under 3 hours, ie minus the lunch time, the traffic jam and queuing for the ferry.) Ths bus ride was comfortable and the driver was courteous. The best time to see the golden ginkgo trees is late Oct.; for red maples it is early Nov."
Must visit,"Dreaming island .. beautiful place to spend the day .. a lot of activities a fun ... amazing place to take a lot of pictures , a mixture of colors and charming views "
Nice fall day BUT TOO MUCH TRAIN,"Visiting Nami Island it’s a very good and relaxing experience, more living in Seoul. Getting away from all the traffic noise and just enjoying a bit of nature it’s very nice, and the food selection offered in the island it’s varied and tasty BUT please keep in mind that it takes A LONG TIME to get there from Seoul and you would only spend 3-4 hours walking around on average.Beautiful to go during autumn!"
Absolutely stunning!,"This island is an absolute treasure in autumn! The colours were spectacular. The island has restaurants, accommodation and entertainment areas but if you go for the trees you won't be disappointed! We spent several hours here, took over 350 photos and left feeling that we had had one of our best days in Korea! Just make sure you see it during the week, because it is absolutely crammed with people from everywhere in Korea at weekends!!"
Nice trip,"I've gone there at the winter. I dont see any yellow leaf and the autumn forrest. However, I love this place and I want to comeback."
Touristy crowded island,"We came around mid Nov. A lot of leaves already fell but its still a beautiful Island. Sad to said that its too touristy and crowded even till evening. Tour group after tour group just kept coming in! Its challenging to snap a nice photo unless you go to other less well known scenery spot. To escape the crowd, likely you have to stay in the island but I got a feeling that after 7am (first cruse) crowd will start coming in. Will not visit again, because i just hate the crowd!"
beautiful island,"Nami is beautiful in all seasons. Lots of trees, beautiful coast line, quaint houses and hotels. A 2-3hr visit as a day triper would suffice. Ferries run every 10-20min from the mainland."
New World,Yes! what i mean is u exactly will feel like u enter a new world i means everythg in there the beauty scenery food attraction game go picnic snack a show like literally including toilet. hahahha i meant everythg! it really makes u feel to live there! Take noted that price shown in most of bloggers did was ended so u have to pay at the price in there's stated. Slightly different/. Make sure to bring some extra money and ferry fee including round tickets.
Lovers' Paradise ,"Nami Island - Strongly recommended day trip. Even if bus loads or should I say ferry loads of tourists come to visit, there's enough room for everyone. Our tourist guide took us a different route and we didn't have to join the parade of tourists to explore the island. We worked our way back through the main walk/path to get a view and feel of the Island's main attraction - tree lined road carpeted with fall colored leaves.Made more famous by the Korean love story, drama series Winter Sonata, it sure is a lovers' paradise. It is definitely family friendly too. Kids playgrounds are also available. "
Spell bound...,I was speechless and it was so beautiful. We visited in autumn (2nd Nov) from Seoul and seems to be the best time. Trees with beautiful colours. There is so much things to do and can easily spend the whole day. From Gapyeong rail station its just 20-30 mins walk (we went by walk as there was heavy traffic). Then you have to buy ticket and take boat (included in tickets) to Nami island. Or you can take zip line for more adventure. A must visit place in South Korea.
Autumn visit ,Went in end oct and unfortunately some of the leaves have withered. There are still some trees here and there in full bloom in yellow and red. Can causally walk for about 2-3 hours taking photos and laze around. Full of tourists place. Their red bean pancake is yummy and it’s red bean latte (mentioned in menu is seasonal). 
Simply Beautiful,"Nami Island is a very beautiful place. We were there at the beginning of autumn. Weather was nice and the leaves were starting to change colour. For those who love to take photos, this will be the perfect place to do so."
Beautiful in autumn,We bought our tour ticket from Klook which just arranged for return coach and ferry ticket. It took about 1 1/2 hour to reach the jetty to cross over to Nami Island. It’s so beautiful in autumn (I was there in May previously) and everywhere you turn it’s a great scenery. We spent 4 hours on the island walking around including taking a break for lunch. Many restaurants on the island but food is generally more expensive on the island. It’s definitely worth visiting.
Tourist Factory,"Sure the nature is beautiful and people say you haven't been to South Korea if you haven't stepped a foot here.BUTThis place is so small and the crowds are so large. I went there to expect nature and enjoy it quietly but instead I found noisy tourists everywhere. Seriously, walked around the whole island and did not find a spot without other people. You can't take proper picture because there are people every 2 meters.There were very limited restaurant options in the island, eash has looooooooonnnnnngggggg queue. We chose the traditional one, and the food was good."
Beautiful,"If you are traveling free and easy, suggestion is to go to Nami Island early to avoid the Tour group. - We took the 6am ITX (KRW 5,900 book online and print the ticket) from Yongsan Station (stayed at Airbnb nearby) to Gapyeong Station (arrive 7am)- took a taxi (KRW 3,700) to Nami Island ticket booth (KRW 13,000). Ferry schedule is about half an hour and takes 5 minutes to reach the island. Advantage of going early is you get to take beautiful photos without human bombs at the back of your photos. "
Nami Island,"This place is part of our tour. But during the time we visited, it was raining heavily. We enjoyed some hot drinks in a coffee shop while waiting for the rain to stop. Lucky enough the rain stop after an hour. So our time then was limited to explore the area. The fact that it was also crowded with so many tourist during our visit in Nami Island makes it difficult to find beautiful spots without any other person in the way. The autumn leaves are blooming it's vibrant colors which came out great in photos. Definitely a beautiful area to visit when you are vacationing in Korea."
Cold Nami Experience,"We went in December - not quite winter yet, but very cold to warm blooded Singaporean. It was nice still and very scenic with lots of tourists despite the cold or because of the cold weather. Will go again during spring the next time."
Beautiful Fall,"I was there when early autumn season in mid October. It was really beautiful, the leaves start to red and yellow. loving so much the color hue, green, red and yellow, it so beautiful!Go there early in the morning (first ferry will be on 07.30 AM) if you can, to avoid the crowd."
October Best time to Visit,Really beautiful during autumn. Best time to visit but also too many people. Best to go early in the morning maybe less crowded and also more time for picture taking and more time to go relax and try the restaurant.
Day trip to Nami Island,"Take a tour from Seoul to Nami island and the Petite France. It was on Saturday and there are thousands of visitors there. First take a boat trip to the island. The island is famous in the autumn watching the red and yellow leaves. People with camera and it is jamming in every main road with trees line up at the island. I hired a bike and biking around the island and it was fun and we are enjoyed it. Tips, if you dare to ride the flying cable from the car park side to the island, And then take the ferry back to the car park entrance. But there are lots of people waiting."
Beautiful Nami island in autumn,Truly scenic and clean island.Tourist friendly with ample amenitiesBe prepared for rain and lots of visitors.
Best Visit in Autumn!,"only an hour from Seoul, this is also a worthy place to visit. The autumn color of Nami Island is super pretty! better to visit it during workday, avoid holiday or weekend to get the best pics without so many crowd."
Beautiful Autumn !! ,Best place to enjoy autumn! But you can't believe the crowd that visited this place. I was there on Friday around 12pm. Both locals and foreigners are flocking into this island as this is one of the attraction you mush visit when you are in Korea. I will advise you guys to go earlier so that it will not be too crowded.There's around 5 or 6 restaurants in the island. But I didn't get to try any of them because I need to wait at least 1hr for a table there. Try their Nami Sausages (it is nice!) and some other snacks. You can have your meal outside the island. 
Stunning!!!,We went towards the end of October and autumn colours was just beautiful! We got here very early to beat the crowds. We are glad we did as it started to get very busy as we was leaving and I can imagine the line for the ferry would be quite long later on in the day. Definitely recommend if you love nature and walking around. 
Nami Island,"An hour from Seoul, visit to Nami Island includes a very short boay ride. Autumn colors are a sight, except that it was peak season for tourists. Walking along the shore was quiet. Best to walk around and get food to go. Avoid sitting in a restaurant, since time in Nami Island is limited."
Foliage at its best.,We were very happy with our day trip to Nami Island. The island was beautiful. It is a privately owned island wherein the owner planted lots and lots of trees. Today the island is a nature sanctuary. Grown trees with various colors and open spaces make the island great for picnic and outdoor activities.Stream and lakes surround the island. Scenic views and great landscaping make the island a great place to visit. During fall season various colors of the leaves make it a visual feast. It’s about 1.5 hours away from Seoul. You need to ride a 5 minute ferry to reach the island. Another way to get to the island is via zipline. Our tour was organized by Top tours Korea.
Perfect for Fall Season but crowded ,"ITX station: Gapyeong. The attraction is mostly the landscape and that Winter Sonata was filmed there. It’s perfect to visit during the fall with the changing colors of maple and ginkgo trees, however, be prepared to be surrounded with hundreds of other people. There’re regular ferry rides from the wharf to island (5 mins ride). There’s a zip line to get to the island faster too. You can spend 2-3 hours here including a meal. The entire island makes great photography for family and couples. There were so many people waiting for taxi so service back to station could be slow. "
Iconic Korean tourist destination,"Great place for taking photos is just one of the many attractions (biking, zipline, etc.) offered in Nami island. More restaurants were established since i I was last here (2012)....Still is as charming and enchanting as the first time....and will always be. Best time to come mid to late afternoons to avoid crowds. "
A nice place for Nature and picnics.,"The place was crowded even ON a wednesday with locals and Tourist. IT is that popular. You have to take a short ferry ride OF about 5 minutes. The long line makes IT a longer wait. The place have very good scenic places for photo op OF colorful autumn colored trees with some, nicely arranged nito rows. There are statues, some for adults only exhibits. A very good place for picnics and long walks albeit The crowd."
A must in South Korea,"Nami island, located in the outskirts of S. Korea is stunning. It's a must to visit this paradise when you're in Korea. It's quite far but it's worth the visit. I can't find the words to describe it and you'll know what I mean when youget there."
Second and last ,The island alone is beautiful the food food and reasonable the trip however is plain nacked horror and I do not have enough explicit words nor would TA !allow them happy to have seen it but never agqin
Too crowded ,We purposely booked a trip online to go to Nami island. Indeed it is a very nice little island but it was too crowded. You have to take a ferry to the island and it takes about 3-5 mins to reach. The ferry keep sending people into the island and you can only see people in front of you. But can't complain more because this is the time to see the autumn leaves and we are also one of them...
A must visit to this paradise ,Nami Island is a paradise in the outskirts of seoul.Was there during the autumn Foliage and being there in person was nothing less of breathtaking views.Avoid the bicycle or electric renting.. Its a ripoff and is absolutely not needed.There are lots of restaurant inside the park and good seating areas.Definitely recommended. 
SOUTH KOREA AUTUMN FOLIAGE,"An awesome trip to S.Korea, Harry Kim fr. Here Korea Travel is a good tour guide for this trip. He brings us to enjoy many good food. Harry Kim is very knowledgeable and making our trip enjoyable and he has done his job professionally and we know much information from Harry Kim.The best place that i like is Nami Island which is beautiful during autumn, and this is the 1st honeymoon for me n my hubby after marriage 24 years.I will highly recommended Harry Kim fr Here Korea Travel to all my friends who wish to visit South Korea. Thanks to Harry Kim and Here Korea Travel."
Beautiful in autumn,One of the must-visit places (at least once) if you’re in South Korea and especially in spring or autumn. We went during autumn - our kids had fun running after squirrels and picking out leaves. So many gorgeous photos to be taken here. 
Gingko Tree Pathway,"Visited the Nami Republic during the best season of the year ..Autumn. The changing colors is the main attraction of this place. It was also the location of the K drama Winter Sonata ? ? (am not a k drama fan so I am not sure if this was the title of the series ) A short ferry ride takes one to the island. The other option to get to the island is to take the Zip Wire better known to us as the Zip Line. It was a crowded Saturday morning. Tourists and locals are all over the place. As you walk around you enjoy the fresh crisp cool air. You are surrounded by trees which provide the shade for the morning walk. The gingko trees line the main walkway .. At the time of my visit the leaves were yellow I was a week or 2 early as I wanted to see them in the orange to red color.. Families have their picnic baskets and enjoy the day by the lake. Food choices in the island are limited to Korean pancakes, Italian resto, hotdog stand and coffee houses. "
Autumn Leave,"Yes. Autumn leave. We plan for the Seoul trip mainly to see autumn leave and Nami Island is the best place for stunning photo and view. The day on our visit no taxi! We have to take bus (normal shuttle bus). No information and only a photo of bus schedule on the bus stop. But, don't worry. I ton of people same as us looking for information. Here you are. Bus number 33-5 is the shuttle bus. Enjoy the view plus sea of people in your photo."
Worth the long trip from Seoul,"We came in early autumn so the leaves were changing colors. I guess the sight will be even more beautiful at the height of autumn. The scenery is postcard perfect but there are other amazing sights in the island both man made and natural. There's a ferry going to the island every few minutes and the entrance fee includes the ferry ride. The place is so romantic, many couples come here for their pre-nuptial photos."
Short stop at Nami Island,"Visited Nami Island as part of our travel itinerary. Nami Island is one of the most popular tourist destination of South Korea. If you like nature, then this is the place for you. Going to Nami Island, you need to make a short ferry ride. Ferry schedules are very frequent, (like every 10 minutes) and the ferry can accomodate up to around 70 people (if I'm not mistaken). The ferry ride was really smooth.Upon arrival, you can see the big signage "" Welcome to Naminara Republic"" and take pictures there. We were only given 2 hours to roam around so we werent able to go around the whole island. At least I get to see the place where they usually shoot movies (the long line of cherry trees). Got to take a picture at the spot where they shot Winter Sonata. There are many activities at Nami Island like bicycle riding and some kind of small cable car for 2. There were some squirrels running to and fro and they are so relaxing to watch. There are also some restaurants and cafes in the Island and I think, they also have a lodge where in you can accomodate. I think the only problem I see is the lack of clean restrooms. As usual, there is a long line for the toilet for ladies. Best to come here first thing in the morning, to really enjoy the calm and serenity of the place. Very good for family bonding and couple date."
Beautiful Island,Nice beautiful island especially on a sunny day. Tall green trees everywhere during summer season. Peacock wandering freely in the park but please do not feed them with grilled sausages bought there. 
Beautiful and peaceful cute nation,About an hours drive from city hall seoul. Peaceful and quiet place with beautiful sceneries. There is a row of cafes and restaurants on the island too. There are hotels on the island if you would like to stay for a night or two. Worth a short trip to escape city living for awhile!
Good daytrip tour from Seoul ,"We took morning train from Seoul station to city near Nami island, then a 10minutes bus to pier and 15 minutes ferry to the island. Island is actually in the middle of river and has lots of activities like biking or just walking around the island with famous avenue for Korean drama Winter Sonata. It has cafe and restaurant in island. For Seoul visitor, Nami island is good option for daytrip tour. "
Nami Island,"This island is beautiful. Filled with lots of activities: from zip lining, kayaking, biking to simply walking around the island. Famous for Korean dramas."
Winter at Nami Island,Very nice place... especially near photoshoot winter sonata and the location is friendly for wheelchair. But the food at nami island is very expensive:(
Romantic island,"This small independent Island is famous for being the screen stage in a famous 90s drama movie series.Now as a tourism place, they do very good with many attractive site, funny activities.I quiet enjoy the peaceful park though."
Well done park,Really a destination for kids or those desiring a walk along a tree shaded road. Eclectic collection of exhibits mostly attractive to kids. A pleasant walk. Short ferry ride to get there. Great at managing crowds. Food offerings are adequate. Shine shops as well. More for locals than foreigners. Not a bad way to spend an hour if in the area. A bit boring as a destination.
Nice place,"Visited here on September 2018, the weather was nice around 18-20 degree.As usual Nami always crowd with foreign and local tourist.We found Nami Island was the good place to sit and enjoy the atmosphere if it’s not too crowd :)We also enjoy when taking the boat from and to Nami IslandThere was a special entrance ticket fee for elderly and afternoon entrance fee after 5PM (if I’m not mistaken) but it’s gonna be dark when arrive to Nami Island :)"
i can spend whole day chillaxing here!,"During Korea thanksgiving, i joined a tour to this island. Even with packs of people, i still feel this place is so enjoyable! We rented a double bike and rode around the island, appreciating all the green grass, trees, river, breeze of wind and some animals running around, squirrels, rabbits and birds. There were also performances and artistic corners around. When we left, the ferry queue was very long, but we board very soon, as each ferry departs every 5 mins! Even my stay was very short (as i joined tour), but i really loved this place, and wish to come back again for this beautiful park!"
Must Visit!,"To reach the island, either by zipwire or ferry ride. Island are landscaped with beautiful trees aligned and suitable for anyone at any age to visit. Bikes are available to rent or just walk to enjoy the scenery. "
Average attraction,"Nami Island is a two-hour travel from Seoul by train. It recently increased its general admission rate from 8,000 won to 13,000 won per person (inclusive of entrance fee and round-trip ferry tickets). We went here on a summer and it looks just like your average park. Probably best to go here during spring or fall. Tip: Save time in exploring this island by renting a bike instead of exploring by foot."
ONE OF THE HIGHLIGHTS DESTINATION IN SOKOR,"The place is quite far from Seoul, and it will take around 5hours of travel if its traffic...The island is famous because of winter sonata and other movies...It is worth the visit if you are a picture addict... Honestly, what i could only remember to this place is their trees and winter sonata cast statue..."
Worth visiting just for the flying fox!,"A nice little island, but to be honest not much to do here. Restaurant in the middle is pleasant for lunch. By far the best thing here is the awesome trip from the mainland to the island by flying fox! Don't miss it, but not for those afraid of heights! Take the ferry instead. But for those brace enough, fantastic! "
Nami Island,"Went to visit Nami Island as part of the tour. It's the set for Winter Sonata (Korean drama). Found out they are their own ""Republic"" with its own hotel, bank, post office, restaurants, gift stores, etc on d the island. Kinda reminded me of the Vatican in Italy. It will say immigration where you buy your tickets but anyone can go in. It's really neat. Walk along the tree lined path, rent a bike, explore or play on the lake. You can stay the night or just make a day trip out of it. Think of it as a mini resort. Family oriented for sure and for couples too.From what I understand its under 2 hours from Seoul. You will ride a 5min ferry ride to reach the island. Nami is now on my bucket list for next time destination (planning to stay the night)."
Nice place to visit!,"Went here via Bus then dropped us at someplace sorry I forgot. Then continued our trip with boat to get to the Island. I didnt buy tickets because it was included in my bus tickets, sorry I forgot the name and where to but them.At first I just walking around the area then I found out that the renting a bike! So me and my friend we rent a tandem bike for two! It was so fun, to stroll around the island using bike! We can stop whenever we like and take photos. Such a nice experience!"
Picturesque,"It is a good place to have a picnic. There are tall, beautiful metasequoia trees that make it a good spot for photos. The best time to visit is in Autumn when the leaves have turned yellow and orange. Very beautiful. This is the shooting location of the well-known K-drama Winter Sonata. There is a statue of the two protagonists to commemorate this show. You can rent a bike and enjoy the whole island. You can reach the island either by ferry or zipline. There are some restaurants in the island. "
K drama setting,For those avid in K dramas this is an interesting place to go. Much better to come here in spring or winter though. it has been named after a controversial General who was buried in that island. but i think nobody cares about that people just passes his grave. from the parking you can take the ferry to cross the river going to the island or take it more extreme and take the zipline. a lot of trees and small parks. Food is much cheaper inside the island contrast to advise of the tour guide that its much cheaper outside. You can appreciate nature there but nothing extra expectacular. 
Korean dramas came to life,"Being a KDrama fan myself, this place is like paradise to my eyes and to my heart. And so when me and my cousins (Kdrama fan also) visited this place back in Nov 2012, it was a dream come true! So may insta-worthy spots to take pictures with and so many drama scenes to reminisce about. This is just heaven for us. The food here was also good. One bad thing about it (well not that it’s really bad) is that there are so many tourists, so manu literally flocking everywhere. Well it only showes that this is very popular to so manu people, even for those not kdrama fans, I think. And because of this visit, I personally loved autumn over any other seasons those colors I seen there were so unreal that my eyes were in feast. I would definitely go back here when I get the chance to visit South Korea again. "
Loved it!,"This is a beautiful and must visit place. We strolled along the full circumference of the island and it was beautiful. Lots of tiny walkways, cosy seating areas and awesome views. We reached at noon and stayed for 4 hours and were able to cover the full island easily. We didn't do any activities though. The weather was great when we visited 3 days back and I am sure this area will be even more spectacular during the fall season."
great place to visit,"it is a wonderful vacation i have ever experienced since ever. the island is small wonderful and beautiful scene with trees suit for photos. we were happy and had a nice photos finally to show in our facebook. we spent one night there and the resort was excellent with traditional with a Korean typical. the room so clean, no dust even we could touch. the pick up car was on time as well as the ferry.i would recommend nami island to you all to visit."
Nice view and lots of insta-worthy backgrounds,Went there early winter last year. The weather was very cold but the scenery was very nice. Nami Island is a muslim -friendly tourist attraction as there are comfortable prayer rooms provided. Do not forget to try the delish pancakes! 
Romantic and peaceful,"My family and I spent an enjoyable 3 hours on a hot weekday afternoon at Nami (Namiseon) Island, which was formed as a result of the construction of Cheongpyeong Dam and was named after General Nami.Getting there: We took a taxi from the main road next to Gapyeong Rail Park and reached the ferry terminal with a taxi fare of ₩5300. We took a bus back to Myeong-dong that left (daily) the ferry terminal at 5pm, which contradicts the 4pm departure time stated in the brochure. The bus is behind the ticket booth and it reached Myeong-dong at around 6:30pm. Besides the Myeong-dong bus, there are direct shuttle bus to and fro Nami Island ferry terminal from Insa-dong (9:30am), Namdaemun (9:30am), Myeong-dong (9:45am). You have to check the departure time from Nami Island Ferry Terminal bus park with the ticket counter.Depending on the time of the day, the ferry departs every 20 to 30 minutes. The “visa fee” (entrance fee) is ₩13,000 for adults (₩10,000 entry fee and ₩3,000 ferry fare), ₩10,000 for students (13-17 years old) and seniors and ₩7,000 for children. However, we paid ₩10,000 each because the ferry fare was free from January to June 2018. Besides the ferry, you could opt to take the zipwire one way into Nami Island (₩38,000, includes entry fee and return ferry fare)The attraction: The “Naminara Republic” brochure mentions “Today Nami Island is a place for rest and relaxation. Human beings, animals and trees share peace, love and harmony far away from crowds and civilisation.” I agree that the “crowds and civilisation” refers to Seoul and mainland Korean peninsula. But every time the ferry berths, crowds of tourists swarmed the island, hence it is never far away from crowds! You have to be patient and wait for the crowd to walk on and disperse before you could have that private moments and fantastic photos with the rows of trees at the Central Korean Pine Tree Lane, Cherry Tree Lane, Gingko Tree Lane and Metasequoia Lane. The trees are so tall that these could reach the sky but more importantly, they offer cooling shade from the sun. At the Metasequoia Lane, don’t miss the brown statues of the two lead actors of the Korean hit drama Winter Sonata (which was shot here) - Yong-joon Bae and Ji-wo Choi, and a bench with the picture of these two Korean actors as the backdrop. Besides the above Tree Lanes, we enjoyed the Nature walk at other parts of the Nami Island. When the weather became unbearably hot, we took refuge at the Book Café and ate bingsu. You could rent bicycles if you don’t want to walk.My next visit to Nami Island would be during the autumn or where I will stay the night in the bungalows (₩160,000 – 380,000) or cottages (₩119,000-149,000) where we can experience the “rest and relaxation” the next morning and “far away from crowds”.Overall, Nami Island amazed me in that it is well maintained since its opening in 1965. Don’t miss his attraction when you are in Seoul…even though you are not a fan of the romantic Korean drama!"
Awesome Island,I am almost lost for words in describing this beautiful island. Nami Island is a gem of South Korea and a must visit attraction. Every season of the year offers a different character and feel in the Island. I loved everything about it and getting lost is certainly an adventure! 
Gorgeous Island,"Nami Island is a stunningly beautiful place which is reachable from Seoul via subway. The nearest station is Gapyeong, from where the Gapyeong City Bus can be boarded. A day pass purchased in the bus allows one to hop on and off the bus any number of times in a day and travel to other nearby attractions such as Petite France and The Garden of Morning Calm.The ferry ride to the island takes about 10 minutes. On entering the island, one can enjoy the performance by a band, the never-ending lane of tall majestic trees, traditional Korean food, photo opportunity with ostriches, and much more."
Love this place,"Went here during summer. It was hot but there's plenty of shade from the trees to go under. Place is very picturesque so you're sure to make wonderful shots here. A whole day is needed to go around the place and relax. There are boat activities here so check them out when you'r there. There are also restaurants and coffee shops around the place so you don't have to worry about getting thirsty or hungry. Again, this is a really nice place and it's a must-visit if you're in Korea."
Beautiful Island,"Nami Island is one of the places that must be visited if you are in Seoul. The island is always filled with tourists from abroad in any season. To get to the island is actually not too expensive, of Seoul metro subway ride to Yongsan Train Station and then ride ITX and continued to Gapyeong Gapyeong tour bus ride to Nami Island. To get to Nami Island, you have to take a ferry for about 2 minutesArriving there the atmosphere of shady trees will welcome you with a breeze. The thing to visit is the winter sonata filming place and there are several other places that are quite interesting. Recommendations to the island should be in the spring or winter so you will get very good photos"
Nami Island & Petite France Tour,We highly recommended a private tour to this place as it is located outside the city. It is a nice place to see and take pictures with family. Our tour guide was excellent and helpful. Tranport and food were good too. 
Beautiful ❤️,Please have a visit here. it's quite pricey for the ticket but it is affordable bout 14000 won. Enjoying the scenery.
Nami Island ,"Not recommended to visit during summertime, nevertheless, the place is stunning beautiful and planning to visit again this coming December❤️"
Pretty island that is worth visiting,"We visited this place as part of a tour during lunch time and we totally enjoyed the time here. As someone from Singapore, am also totally surprised by the presence of a Merlion here.Even though you may not be a Winter Sonata fan (the island is popular because of this), Nami Island is still very pretty and relaxing. You will need to take a ferry to reach the island (or you can zipline in if you're feeling adventurous for around 30,000+ won), and there are a lot of different facilities on the island aside from all the pretty nature spots. There are cafes, museums, restaurants and even a hotel on the island for those who want to spend the night.Love the scenery here, the line of trees on the side of the path is really iconic and place is definitely romantic. You can also get good water views and you can also do water sports if you want to, for a fee of course. Highly recommend to visit the place during autumn or spring as the place will be more beautiful. You can easily spend up to a day here if you want to complete all the activities.I was okay with just the 3 hours that we spend here, as it was enough to sample what the island has to offer. There are also eateries before you board the ferry to the island and water sports all around. Loved the place and recommend visiting as part of a tour."
Beautiful island of nature ,"Get away from the busy city of Seoul by taking a short trip out to Nami Island! Just an hour’s drive or so out from the main city, take a ferry to the independent island which seems to be a nature reserve all on its own. Plenty of tall and beautiful trees of varying types that give an awesome landscape and backdrop for pictures, especially in the autumn or winter seasons as well as animals like ostriches, peacocks, rabbits and squirrels to be sighted all around. "
Well worth a visit!,"Great walks, beautiful sights, lots of photo opportunities, nice ice-cream cone vendors, numerous restaurants to choose from, a wide variety of drinks (including beer, wine and coffee) available, fun ferry crossing, information boards everywhere, bunny rabbits hopping around everywhere, lovely gift shops dotted around the island, an NSPCC train, games for kids, water sports and a zipline available if you have time. No end to the fun, highly recommend this place!"
Korea trip 2018,Anyongaseo the wonderful day of nami island south of Korea. You can not be happy with this place if you come alone so you must bring your girlfriend or boyfriend 
Memorable experience ,"It was a very memorable experience for us to visit this man made island. Everything was very organised, even including the ferry ride to/from the island.The island has got many beautiful landscapes. Even though many of the places were man made, they looked very natural.We rented bikes to go around the island and it was a very enjoyable experience. "
Worth a visit to Nami Island,"This artificial island is famous because of korean drama ""Winter Sonata"". Really enjoyed walk into woods, take nice photos and yummy dakgalbi."
A great day trip!,"Namisum is a tiny half-moon shaped island located in Chuncheon, South Korea, formed as it was inundated by the rising water of the North Han River as the result of the construction of Cheongpyeong Dam (청평댐) in 1944. Its name originated from General Nami (남이장군), who died at the age of 28 after being falsely accused of treason during the reign of King Sejo, the seventh king of the Joseon Dynasty of Korea. Although his grave was not discovered, there were a pile of stones where his body was supposed to be buried. It was believed that if someone took even one stone from there, it would bring misfortune to their house. A tour company arranged the grave with soil and then developed Namisum into an amusement park.I visited Nami Island with a friend and we took a ferry across to it - although a Zip Line is optional for a higher fee. Nami Island has restaurants with very good Korean food: BBQ and hot pot style...There is a Jittney to drive you around for a small fee so you can see the perimeter of the Island. There is a small Ostrich farm. There are even guest houses available to rent. It's a very nice day trip and worth going to. Very similar to West Lake in Hang Zhou Province, China, but definitely larger."
awesome island,"nami island, as they say is a republic on its own, it has everything from own hotels, restaurants, water sports, nature trip even having its own Cetral bank for currency exchange. a day is not enough though to explore this awesome place"
Zip Wire,"I believe the ferry costs W7,000. If you're more adventurous and want to see beautiful views, take the zip line over the Han River, which was about W40,000. That includes zipline and admission to Nami Island. The adventure zip line is faster and takes you across to a different island, then you will still take a ferry to nami Island. The Family zip line is longer and slower, but takes you straight to Nami Island. Nami island is full of beautiful views and things to look at. There's a few restaurants to choose from. Looks like a great place for kids with a lot of activities. I can't wait to go back in the fall. "
Nami Island,Quite a pretty place to walk along the rows of trees and it was cooling under the hot sun. There were also plenty of restaurants you can take a break and have a meal before continuing the walk at the island
Worth a visit,Its an hour and a half to reach Nami Island from Seoul. Its gets longer if traffic is bad. You go for a 3 minute ferry ride to reach the island. Its quite artistic and its a nice place to spend your day. I would add this to one of the things to do when visiting south Korea. 
Island retreat,"Visited here playing music as a tourist, really impressed with the energy in the island and the level of detail and quality of the landscape, ornaments, restaurants. The design at each turn is apparent, aimed at working in harmony with humans to invoke relaxation and harmony. It is a bit touristy ...probably.... but as a tourist, I loved it!"
I'll love to see it on fall season.,"I went to Nami Island on early April, I guess it was not the best time to go there if you look for the beautiful trees. I recommend you to go on fall season, which is around October or November.Other than that, the place is actually nice, they have bike rent for us to go around the island. They also have zip wire to go to the island if you feel taking a boat to go across the island is a bit boring.There's a lot food choices with variety of prices and also a convenience store on the island.I will try to go back on fall."
A day full of joy💟,"Nami island was really an interesting experience for us...Our visit to Nami island was full of joy; we had a blast riding zip wire ...as we went through the nature side,saw artistically organized worth visiting places in the island such as a kids library, a nice Asian style restaurant,souvenir stores."
too touristy,"nami is a must visit place in korea. the island become popular after the k-drama winter sonata hit the tv show around the world. it is a nice and small island but too many tourist in a day make it crowd and the beauty fade away. the other problem is when to get back to main land, i need to queue for a loooong q. for muslim, there is a halal restaurant in the island and they also make a prayer room. a good effort from the local management sice the island is really famous among muslim from SEA."
Petite France and Nami Island Tour,"We took a guided tour from Seoul to Petite France then to Nami Island on May 29, 2018. We booked it online about 2 weeks prior on KLOOK. It was just under $50 USD per person and only included transportation and some minimal talking from the tour guide. We were picked up by bus from Myeongdong Station Exit 2 in the morning and returned by night. It was a fun day trip though we felt Nami Island was the better attraction because there were more things to do than Petite France, which is more just for photographs. Nami Island is really a park accessible by boat or zipline -- but you can't carry your bags on the zipline. There are food stalls, cafes, and bike rentals on the island which is really pretty for picture taking."
Winter Sonata,"Those who watched the Winter Sonata will see this place before, alot ot good view, we took a vehicle to go around the island for KR7000 20 minutes ride"
"it should be very fun, but…","unfortunately I came here on national children day, very crowded and lots of queues. Even the queue is very long from the harbour to cross the river.Nami island itself was beautiful. Everywhere we looked there were rows and rows of trees. Although it was quite sunny, the trees provided shade in most places on the island. You can spend 2 to 3 hours walking around the island, the scenery is very nice. this island is very famous for winter sonata filming location, one of the most popular korean drama (actually i have never watched).A lot of good spot to take pictures, if you lucky can see the local animals like rabbits and squirrels. Love to be back in autumn peak season. it should be Great."
Nami island,Maybe nami island is beautiful in winter. Summer here is nothing special. Will come again when fall or winter.
Amazing Island ,"It was a very amazing and beautiful island every one will visit this place will enjoy with nature beauty .. also many activities there like ride bike , ride train and water games "
wonderful island,"I been here for summer and all those leaves are different color. I love everything here, all Korean couple are so cute and they were wear the same clothes. all the area are clean ever a lot of people."
Must visit,"Make sure you visit this place at least once.It is a mini secluded island in the middle of Korean Peninsula.I suggest you book a tour service online before your visit (e.g. Klook). To avoid crowds, visit at the earliest time (9 AM-ish) as you still need to take a boat there. We took the path contrary to the suggested pathway so we were able to take in the scenery without crowds at all.The middle of the island is the most crowded especially the Winter Sonata photo spots.You don't need a long time to circle the island, only around 2 hours, or 3 if you want to visit the museums as well."
WINTER SONATA,"Most famous Korean movie , Winter Sonata was filmed here.Its a must to visit for winter sonata fans. The island exectly same as you watching the drama..and Just get ready your camera because Nami is peaceful island with its breathtaking view."
UNICEF family Friendly Island,"Nami island is a must visit for all holiday makers in Seoul. It is the island of Korean Film making industry. You will be transported to the main island through 10 minutes Ferryboat ride. The island itself is small but beautiful. The main walking way is lined with Pine trees. It is usually sunny, so make sure you have your hat and sunglasses with a bottle of water. Our tour guide recommended a traditional lunch at Nammoon (Authentic Korean restaurant). We had a great, healthy and tasty lunch. I am not very sure about the name of the dishes, see photos for illustration. You can stay at the island for a few days in one of the hotels for rest and relaxation. SEE photos."
Zipline to Nami Island with secret photo spots,"It costs ₩38000 per person, including the zipline, private boat to Nami Island and way back ferry. I expected taking Zipline to the main island of Nami. In fact, you have to take a boat transfer to the Nami Island. They have two courses: 30-40km/ for family and 80km/ for adventure. **reservation is not required if you visit Nami Island during summer. The waiting time is short too:)  There are many secret photo spots here and I think it is even prettier than the main Nami Island. We have waited for 10 mins for the short boat trip, which takes around 8 minutes. There are only 10 ppl in the boat and luxury compared to the ferry, which can carry 100+ people. "
Not worth in Summer,"I don’t know. I just thought it’s too much a hassle to travel to Nami in summer. Not that I’ve been during other seasons. But Nami in summer is not ideal. Firstly, the weather is a killer. Super hot. Secondly, there wasn’t much to see. The cafes here and there were nice but not easy to find tables as many people would like to find shelter to hide away from the sun too. Thirdly, too crowded. There were not just tourists but also Koreans. One can choose to either take the ferry or zip line to get to Nami Island when you reached the ferry terminal. The ferry is just a 5min ride. We got onto a coach for a one day tour to Petite France and then Nami Island. Fyi, the coach ride for the last 15 min to Petite France made some feeling nauseous as the road was quite winding. Quite certain even if the tour were to go Nami Island first, would be the same. "
Short day tour to Nami island,Taking coach to ferry terminal for a 5 min transfer to the island was easy. The island look small but walking from one end to the other takes about 45 mins. Took a non-stop tour train cost ys 7000 KW was a good choice so at least we know where are the places we need to explore later. It will be nicer to go in winter to take the stretch of trees where the Korean tv series Winter Sonata was filmed.A trip worth going! 
Best Place to Get Away from the City,"Learn from our mistake: Don't forget to tap out your Seoul T-money card from Yongsan station when you are about to transfer to an ITX train going to Gapyeong.You can purchase your ticket from the station (if you want a reserved seat) or you may also buy your tickets on-board if you don't mind standing. The conductors during our trip were kind enough and knew basic English so it was not much of a trouble for us.Spend your entire day to Nami Island for a picnic. There's no corkage fee if you bring your own meals, although food sold inside the resort were not too expensive as well. You may opt to skip Petit France. :)Instead of paying for an unlimited bus ride for a day, just ride a local bus to Nami and back. We paid for an unli bus ride and we had a not so pleasing experience with it. The bus from Nami to Petit France was full so we had to stand during the entire ride (it felt like almost an hour ride to the next destination). We got dizzy, thus we did not enjoy Petit France as much as we have to."
Flying Zipline to Nami Island,We have good experience taking the Zipline to Nami Island during winter time. Nice scenery from high.
One of my Faves,"Been here spring and autumn twice, this year for summer. Hope next time winter season.Its pretty and very picturesque. Love the trees.Go on weekdays, early morning for less crowd."
The most beautiful scenic island in south korea,When I boarded the tour ferry I felt the wind blowing at my face when I was looking at the island view and it was very magnificent and beautiful. 
Try the Zipline ,"You can choose to go Nami Island by Zipline or ferry. We took zipline and it was fun. Family pass can be bought online to skip the queue. It includes 1 x bus trip, 1 x train ride, Cycling and treego at a package price. Island is relatively small, landscaping was a little disappointing. Suitable for family with kids as there’s activities eg treego. "
Naminara Republic,"Spent my birthday in Nami Island. It was magical. Although the place was dotted with people, I still enjoyed the beautiful garden, tree-lined walkways, the river-view, the art work display, the children's book corner.The korean restaurant in the island also served delectable food (dak galbi) although it is a bit pricey.Wiuld like to return to this beautiful place."
Something to check off list,"People are speaking highly of this place. I would recomend it if you have a special someone, you want to have relive romantic moments from a korea-novela. If you're a solo traveler, avoid this if couples being sweet to eaxh other irritate you.But you can come if you have family or friends with you. "
Nature scenery,"Namiseom or more popular as Nami island is a well known island in South Korea. Filming location for the most famous korean drama “Winter Sonata “ We took the ferry to reach the island or you pay more and go by Zip line. Ferry ride was just 5 – 6 minutes. Half moon shape is a unique feature to this island Attractive landscapes with no telephone poles gives a natural feeling. Tree lined walkways are amazing. Few of them are Pine, Ginko , Matasequoin, Cherry and many more . Cute little kimchi huts adds a different beauty to the island. Bunnies and squirrels roam around freely. Unfortunately Water garden swimming pool wasn’t operating. Plenty of photo-ops. Winter sonata statue and Mermaid statue are the two popular statues. Saw two ostriches fighting with each other. Opens from 7.30am to 9.45pm.Villas and bungalows are available to stay on this island.In spite of many tourists and locals , we had great time walking around."
Very picturesque ,We were there during the winter season and it was extremely cold. Need to take a boat ride to reach the island. It was very scenic and romantic especially along the neat rows of trees.
Romantic island,"For me the best time to visit is during autumn/sping - afternoon 3:30-4pm just before sunset. Once you arrive, don't linger near the ferry wharf, go straight to the farthest point - Gingko Tree Lane/Metasequoia Lane and walk your way back to the ferry wharf. Metasequoia lane would be best around 4pm just when the sunlight is at the right angle. The lighting would be so nice. Other than this visitor can have a relax time watching the trees and enjoying the clean air. There is a famous pancake there, sweet but not that sweet..very nice...."
Good scenery but so hot ,"We went there early of June, was pretty hot, but we really enjoyed the trip.. will go there again next time during autumn or winter! "
Interesting experience,A very picturesque island it was fun to travel on the boat packed out with locals and to see them all enjoying their day out. Several choices for lunch and coffee and many photo opportunities. Not really the place for a solo visit as you feel lonely among the crowds.
Only for fans of K drama 'Winter Sonata',"Nami Island is popular among Koreans as an outdoor vacation spot, but so are Jeju many other places on the Korean Peninsula. It is scenic in autumn when the foliage turns into vibrant hues of yellow, orange and green, but imho not worth a detour in the hot summer months. Indeed day tours to Nami Island are packaged together with two other places viz Garden of Morning Calm and Petit France for a more substantive day trip out of Seoul. Visit the Nami Island Tourist Info Centre in Insadong for help to plan your itinerary. The easiest and most economical way is to take the Nami Island shuttle from Insadong; spend the night before your day trip in Insadong. If you plan to join a Nami Island day tour (semi guided), I recommend spending the night before your visit at Prince Hotel in Myeongdong, as the tour pick up point is at the open space in front of The North Face Store right beside this hotel. Wear comfy shoes and use sunblock liberally as the summer sun's rays can be scorching in the afternoons."
Picturesque Nami Island,"We took the 7 am ITX train from Yongsan and arrived Gapyeong Station at 8 am. Took a taxi to the wharf costing 4000 Won as the public bus won't arrive till more than 45 minutes later.Taking the ferry across was just 5 minutes. The rest of the time was spent at this fabulous island made famous by the Kdrama Winter Sonata.The island was really lovely with plenty of picture opportunities. It wasn't very crowded when we were there. There are some restaurants and shops on the island.By the time we left the island after 10 am, ferry loads of tourists were arriving. We were glad we came very early to avoid the crowd. Nami Island is touristy but a really nice place to visit even if you are not a fan of Winter Sonata.There are many restaurants at the wharf area and other water activities nearby including bungee jumping. Don't worry about going hungry here."
Iconic Island,"A great island to visit, if you love nature this is the island to visit, great for family picnic and photo taking."
Second time visiting!,"It’s my second time visiting Nami Island and it was just another ‘walk in the park’. It is a tourist spot with beautiful scenery for all seasons. There’s nothing much to this place if you’re a camera shy person because this place is meant for photo taking sessions. It’s pretty far off from seoul city centre, only visit if you really like what you see on photos! "
Memories ,"It was the Korean series Winter Sonata that made me dreamt of visiting Nami Island. It was the most unexplainable nostalgic moment I’ve been as a tourist. Only a fan would understand. Nevertheless, everyone would enjoy the beautiful sceneries especially at this time of the year and relax in an atmosphere filled with romance. "
Really good place to visit,"Honestly, I never expected this place to be so nice. It turned out to become one of the highlights of our South Korea family trip. My kids enjoyed the short boat ride and the activities on the island. Would you believe they even have some ostriches there! I think you will love the place even if you're not a big fan of the show, Winter Sonata. There are lots of food stalls and restaurants around the island and tried to eat as much food as we could! Will definitely go back to visit Nami Island again someday."
Enjoyable,"Nice island to visit in April, we missed the cherry blossom, but its still a nice scenic visit and very enjoyable."
Peaceful island! Great for photos! ,"It’s a nice trip if you like nature, trees and love taking OOTDs. A lot of Korean couples come here for dates. It’s a 1 hr or so bus ride from Myeong-Dong and a 5 mins ferry that comes every 30 minutes. There was WiFi on the bus! I went during summer. It was abit hot and my family picked a nice picnic bench to eat our Gimbaps we bought from the underground shopping area at the shinsegae underpass. As the food on the island is more expensive and not as nice, even my Korean friends told me to eat before going to Nami IslandOn 28th May when I visited, the maple garden was so picturesque ! "
Green Trees for Summer,"I think it is better if you book a tour going to Nami Island, just so the transportation is easier. From Myeongdong it was like an hour and roughly 30 mins to go to Nami Island via Bus. There are restaurants in and out of Nami Island, so if you are going to have lunch there it would be fine. After having our lunch outside Nami Island we already went to the Ferry Boat (around 10mins). And voila! Welcome to Nami Island itself. We went there during summer season so the trees were green. There were also quite a number of people, but I still managed to take a good shot. I suggest you go here on weekdays because I’ve heard there are more people on weekends. There are a lot of activities in Nami Island, you could even ride a vehicle for 7,000won for a 20minute tour (or view because the driver didn’t really speak English) for the whole place. You could also rent a bike, because let’s face it, it is tiring to go walk around (since it’s pretty big too)This place has a lot of kids playing around, so this is good if you got Kids with you. Overall, I would love to visit Nami again. Better make sure to check it out when you visit Seoul"
Photogenic place,"Nami Island is a very picturesque place and the location for many Korean dramas. To go there you will have to take a 5 minute ferry ride. The ferry ride is very smooth and uneventful, you won't even notice it moving. For the more adventurous, you can even zipline your way to the island.There are a lot of photogenic spots and secret nooks which you can just pass away the time. Lots of restaurants, shops and entertainment to keep you from getting bored. If it's not raining, best to rent a bike and enjoy the scenery. There's even a little train for the kids."
Go for the scenery,"People recommending this place to go as a ""beautiful place you never seen before"" and I have to admit it is true. However, it is pretty far from downtown Seoul (around 1-2 hours ride) and if you're traveling with small children without a tour bus (or renting a car) I don't think it's worth the hassle. Even though there are so many attractions for children, especially the picture book library beyond the cafes, and many many photo spots designed for families. Another thing, this island is famous for it's Winter Sonata monuments. If you're a fan of Winter Sonata or K-Drama in general, do not miss this spot. Overall, I think it's a nice place to visit, and if you're bringing a travel photographer, you'll have an unforgettable photo album."
Winter sonata,Beautiful island. Not far from Seoul. One day trip to this place is enough. Must visit place in Korea if you korea drama lovers hehe
Lovely island,"Nami Island is always on my itinerary whenever I visit S. Korea. It is a very beautiful place, with cherry blossoms in early April and red maple leaves (as well as golden ginkgo leaves) in autumn. If you look around carefully you can find squirrels. A great place for photography."
Beautiful Island,"Nami Island is a beautiful island with cinematic sceneries, a just setting for the korean tv series winter sonata, that set a trend for korean tv series worldwide. The island is well kept and has different animals co habiting with nature. If planning to go there, set it in the early morning to fully explore the entire island, and wear comfortable shoes for walking."
Felt Like A Dream,"I've read so many things about Nami Island and how it would be amazing to go there on a day trip. But when I got there I just felt like I was dreaming. It really was so lovely to walk around the island. Very relaxing to just go around and explore the area as it really is so beautiful. If you're into photography, you would love this place so many amazing views and spots."
One Day Adventure!,"When we visited Nami Island, we scheduled it for the whole day because we did not know what to specifically do there. We actually planned to go to Petit France and Garden of the Morning Calm, but that did not happen. We just stayed in the island from 10AM to 3PM and we enjoyed! If you are like us who enjoy sightseeing, taking pictures (tons of them), biking and eating, then Nami Island will truly be an adventure. There are a lot of tourists. I mean it. You need to be first in every picture-worthy spot or wait paitiently for your turn to take pictures. We enjoyed biking the whole island. It was seriously nice! The spots at each end of the island is a little different but it gives the same calming vibe. Enjoy taking videos!"
Just beautiful ! ,"For Korean film lovers, this is a romantic place to visit. We were here in April and the weather was really cool. A short ferry will find us on the main river island. Should rent a bike to explore and have an ice cream. Selfie and capture all sweet moments "
Kdrama feels!!,"Nami island is always in the list for Korea trip. This place is very relaxing and very cold. There's so many instagramable spot here. Of course as a Kdrama fan, statue of Winter Sonata and Tree lined path is a must.There's so many restaurant to choose in the island and even before riding a ferry going to Nami."
Nami island 😍,The best thing i have visit nami island and i want to come again. The island is very very beautifull i don't know what to say and i never want to forget it. 
Raining,"My daughter and I came around first week of June and the weather is so unpredictable, the other day it's raining and the next day It's so hot and sunny. But we still enjoy Nami Island. Hoping to see it covered with snow next visit"
Family Retreat,"went to this place called Namimara Republic. a wonderful ferry trip to the island. plenty to see and very good place for family, couple and everyone. the management very thoughtful and considerated to the visitor."
a beautiful island with beautiful maple trees,"We joined a local tour to get there on 30 April. There were many locals and oversea tourists visiting this island. It was clean, beautiful and well-maintained. Many beautiful trees and flowers were planted there. It was also a right season to visit there as we could see a lot of nice flowers with colorful maple trees. There were coffee shops and restaurants on the island too. You can easily spend a few hours to relax yourselves, with a cup of coffee or ice cream. It is a must-see island from Seoul."
Beautiful place!,"Nami Island is a beautiful and relax place to visit! With the nice cooling weather in spring, you can have a cup of hot drink and enjoy reading there."
Comfort to sleep,"Good and comfy to sleep at Nami island. In the winter it’s nice weather. A bit dust if your nose is too close, beware. Enjoy!"
Spring Sonata ...,"Finally visited Nami Island on my 2nd trip to South Korea. I have heard alot about this island from friends donkey years ago before Winter Sonata aired on TV. After the drama, it makes me wanted to visit this place very badly. A small but beautiful island who no residents, purely an attraction of Chuncheon. There is a resort on the island and some restaurants though. There is the Unicef theme park on the island too. We chose the right time to visit as it is not over crowded. Love the rows of straight trees which is the main attraction. A good place to take OOTD pictures though. We also seen couples re-enacting some scenes of the Winter Sonata! Lol We took the bus trail ride that covered the coastline of the island. Breath-taking scenery and locals jogged or strolled along the coastline enjoying the view. An island not to be missed if you are in Chuncheon."
Sights and food,"Stopped by as part of a day tour from Seoul. The tour already included the boat ride to the island. There was an option of zip lining into the island but when I went there was a 2-hour wait so didn't go ahead with it. We were also given maps of the island which was really useful in getting around.The island itself is amazing. Plenty of things to see as you walk around the island. We were there during the winter so they had quite a few ice sculptures around. There were a few water features but they were mostly covered in ice. Interestingly they had ostriches as well. We just had to be careful since the ground was also covered in ice and snow so it was quite slippery.Aside from the sights, there were also plenty of food places around including the snowman hotteok, which was a delicious crispy pancake filled with sugar.A really nice place for a day trip. Even though there were plenty of people we found a few places which were a bit more serene."
Wonderful,We book a tour in going for easy transport and entrance. It was raining and cold but still manage to get a glimpse of the island. Coffee shops and resto were around. Its hard to take photo on the ginko trees and other spot since a lot of people wanted to take photo also. Its a good place to visit and photo taking
Nami Island at winter,"Visit this place last January 2017. Half of the place was covered in snow, nice to eat sausage or corn while walking or you can rent a bike while strolling the island in a cold and breezy weather. A must to go place while in Korea! will try to visit this place in other season."
Great place for nature lovers!,"This was our first visit to Seoul and there was no way we could have come back without visiting Nami Island. We reached there early around 0930am after 1.5 hours drive from Seoul and spent ~3 hours exploring the place. It does get crowded later in the day and its hard to get your desired photo without someone getting into your frame. There are different tree lanes of Korean Pine tree, Gingko trees, metasequoia and cherry trees offering picture perfect backdrops. Needless to say there are enough spots for the K-drama fans of Winter Sonata. I was pleasantly surprised to find ostriches and peacocks in this place besides others like large squirrels! Spent a good time exploring several souvenir shops. If you like something especially the Nami Island snowmen souvenirs, buy them here as we didn't find them in Seoul.Even though I am personally a big fan of bright red and orange hues of autumn, but our visit during the spring time was equally beautiful! This is a nature lovers delight and I guess any season is worth a visit. Besides, the road journey from Seoul passes through the beautiful countryside with mountains and river, which is a bonus. Overall we thoroughly enjoyed the day outing. Definitely recommended."
Feels!,"To be honest there is nothing much to do in Nami, just taking photos. While every spot is intagrammable, that's basically what's in there. Well if you are a fan of Winter Sonata, it's a must, there's their sculpted figures in there. It would take hour/s for you to roam the area. Nonetheless, it is said your Korea trip won't be complete with Nami, and I also do believe too though, it just give you the feels of all those you've seen in dramas."
Surprisingly authentic korean dishes,Had lunch with my family on nami island and was surprised by their tasty korean dishes. Ordered the beef bulgogi stew served with leafy vege and boiled glutinous rice with beans and red dates wrapped in lotus leaves. Another dish was the crispy seafood pancake and lastly we asked for the acorn jelly salad. The serving was big and enough to fill 5 of us. Didn’t expect such a good traditional korean restuarant on nami island. 
Pretty but very busy,"Our trip to Nami Island was very enjoyable. Especially if you walk around the outside of the island, which not many people do. However if you try and walk through some of the main paths, it is chaotically busy (and we went mid week)I’m glad I’ve been, but I don’t feel the need to rush back."
Enchanting!,"This is one of the best place I visited when we were in Korea. The trees, landscape and weather are perfect for strolling. My wife and I rented a biked to see the whole island. There are several site attraction and photo spot in this island. I highly recommend renting a bike to go around this island. The island is quite huge and if you are only on day your, i suggest to go early morning and spend 1 entire day in this island. Will definitely visit this place again and try to stay overnight. "
trees,i can called this as a romantic place. and very nice to visit with family. you must take ferry to go here. wonderful place with a lot of trees make this place to take photo. they also have souvenir shop for tourist who came here. i very recommend this place when you come to south korea. also i recommend you to come at winter season.
Beautiful,Been here during the winter and again during the spring. Both times I enjoyed walking through and taking pictures of the various nature sites and exhibits. The tree lines paths are beautiful. You can arrive here via ferry or the zip line!
place is a nice visit for a picnic..,"nice place for a family picnic..go by ferry or zipline..as there was a long queue for zip line, i went by the ferry and it was a good visit. line of trees, statues and much for the fans of winter sonata..took a bicycle for 30 min and it was fun driving the bike and looking for the spots..overall a fine place for outing.."
"If you go to Seoul and decided to skip this, you are missing out.",The best place for families in my opinion. My toddler enjoyed running around chasing the squirrels and rabbits here. it was so picture perfect! Do note that the hotteok there was overrated. Can be skipped in my honest opinion. The dakgalbi before heading to the wharf was good though!
ONLY for die-hard fans of winter sonata,"The amount of money you pay to get to and enter this place is NOT worth it. If you want to see trees, there are other free parks in Seoul which are just as,if not more beautiful. Granted, the place is not ugly. But let me repeat, the TIME AND MONEY spent to get here is NOT WORTH IT. Wont even bother to write about the food and activities available at the island. It's just not worth it."
Good place to visit ,The scene is nice and the place is pretty big! A great place for photo and relax walking. My kid enjoy running at spacious ground.
Tourist trap,Very very overrated and expensive to travel to. Attractions were very little and you see rows of trees and some little houses. Unless you are a die hard fan of winter sonata.... Otherwise this place is just another park and any other free park would be nicer and more centrally located.
Refreshing afternoon walking,"Nami island is a must visit when you come to South Korea, it's had its own history, beside the popular k-drama shooting. The view will be amazing in spring and autumn. A must experience, you can enjoy the island using rail bike or just walking slowly while enjoying the fresh air and the view."
Nami Island adventure,Our family had a fantastic holy week vacation in Seoul South Korea this last holy week.we visited Nami Island and we enjoyed out stay there. We had a lot of photos taken.we did a lot of walking..sad to say we only have limited time to explore the island because we have other places to visit..the place is great.
Great way to spend the day,My friend and I arrived at the quay and decided to do zip lining- which was great fun and well worth it! We then got the ferry to nami Island which is beautiful and has plenty to see. We walked around admiring the trees and the natural beautiful. We also hired a bike for 30 minutes which is a great way to see the island. Plenty of food and drink plus some great photo opportunities. I really enjoyed my time on the island and would definitely recommend it! 
Nice experience by taking zipwire to Nami Island,"Is the nice place to visit and it is famous mostly due to the Korean drama - Winter Sonata. We not manage to watch the red maple leaves but it still the nice scene. If you brave enough can take the zipwire to Nami Island (besides ferry). Although is quite expensive (KRW 38,000.00 where it covers the admission fee to Nami Island as well as the ferry ride back) but is a good and memorable experience.You may take photo with the couple snowmen which is shown in the Winter Sonata. You can go via First Kiss Bridge and the “real” one is located by the lake after the First Kiss Bridge)"
Not a must,"To get to nami island from Seoul, there are trains to Gapyeong Station. Once there you can choose to take the city tour bus or public bus. The bus stop are just right outside the station exit and there are timetable for the bus and a tourism counter nearby, you can't miss it. The tour bus go to every tourism attractions within Gapyeong area but if you just want to get to nami island, take the public bus as it is much cheaper. At the wharf, you can choose to zipline to the island or take the ferry.This place is for family and couples, the place got the family fun and romantic feel to it. I wasn't a fan of the place though, many places were closed or under construction when I was there on Jan 2018. Still, there wasn't much to see, the tall trees are nice but that's about it, the place doesn't feel natural, it is small and fill with tourists during winter, can't imagine what it is like during warmer times. I can't penalize this place because it is what is meant to be and not a place for solo traveler who like to surround by pure nature."
Stunning scenery,"We visited korea last month and Nami Island was one of the attraction the tourist guide was telling us on our first day..Nami Island was famous because of the korean drama Winter Sonata.I did browse the internet and truly it was beautiful.Unfortunately it was winter when we visited the place so i did not expect so much.The river was frozen and there were diggings due to ice.I guess spring would be better.Overall,the place was nice.We stayed there for an hour and took the time to enjoy the coolness and the fresh air Nami could offer."
A must visit in South Korea,"Book a day tour to visit Namiseom Island - Gapyeong Railbike Tour - Petite France (all cost around S$200 via Changi Recommends website) as they are worth your visit! It’s around 1.5 hour drive from Seoul so if you take public transport, it will be more troublesome. We visited Nami Island around mid december and we were lucky to see some patches of snow (although not heavy snow). Basically you need to take a chartered ferry to Nami Island (the ferry runs frequently, only around 10min journey time).The whole island can be covered within 3-4 hours by foot. It was cold though. There is one halal restaurant swlling Southeast Asian food (tasted good as well). You may want to rent a bicycle to explore the island (but snowy surface may be slippery so we’d rather walk).You must be patient to take photos at good spots that there are crowds of tour groups around. "
Amazing scenery ,"Totally fall in love with this place, it offers a stunning and magical view. Great place to spend some time with family or group of friends, it's a great place take pictures. It's so beautiful!!! "
Winter can be Bad,"We went there with a tour group. The whole island is small but with several good spots for pictures. Unfortunately, we came on a snowy wintery day. There were icy road and cold wind, very difficult to enjoy the scenery. However, I think we will be back again in warmer time."
Beautiful scenic place ,"Lovely scenic island... good for couples as many good spots for photographs. Cover the island by walking... there are people cycling round the island, but it’s a small area so perhaps better to cover on foot than by bike. Do try the pan fried “toebokki” (not sure of spelling) ... oily and very yummy. Worth the calories. "
Beautiful Place not only because of Winter Sonata has taken shoot here,I went to this place on February (Winter Season). It has many beautiful sceneries. They provide the sliding ice (I don't know the exact name) even adult can play. I might wanna come back here to explore more.You have to walk further to get to the statue of Bae Yong-Joon from the port.
stunning beauty of nature,"very clean and well maintained island, great for everyone and we really enjoy this trip so i recommended to anyone that will go to south korea to avail this tour via KLOOK. Thanks"
Relaxing excursion,"You don't have to be a fan of KOREAN drama ""Winter Sonata"" to find it interesting to visit Nami Island. There are enough attractions like the Pine Tree lane, the Gingko lane to enjoy a leisurely walk with your family and lived ones. The island is small 4km at it's widest and laid back. It's a short boat ride 10mins or if you are a thrill seeker you can opt for a grand entrance cash zip wire 38000 krw. Either way you did it a worthwhile visit to the island."
One of those touristy things you need to do,"Nami doesn’t offer that much but it’s still a pretty little island in the middle of a river. I don’t have a thing for Korean drama but walking around on (frozen) ground and amidst (bare) trees was a nice change to the concrete jungle of Seoul. Maybe the experience was a lot better for us because we went on a tour and was there very early before all the other tourists came. Nami felt far colder than Seoul, when I was asked by a local which places I’d been to and mentioned Nami, he said: “ten times colder than here, yes?” It was. If you’re coming in winter, do prepare for the chill. It was pretty enough in winter but I think it would be stunning in spring or autumn. We opted not to eat lunch at Nami but took it instead at the wharf as we had a schedule to keep. There are a lot of restaurants at the wharf and if you are planning to head out to Petite France, I suggest you do the same.Both places may appear to be nothing more than a setting to popular Korean dramas but they still merit a visit even for those who aren’t into that form of entertainment. Nami has its own story to tell, as soon as you’re done with your selfies :)"
Picture perfect,This was my second trip to Nami Island. The first was during autumn 4 years back. I must say that this place never fails to disappoint. Photos taken looks like they were from the cover of some Korean drama. Definitely a must visit for k-drama fans.
Beautiful scenery ,"We went to Nami island by shuttle bus from Insadong Tapgol west gate , departure 9:30am sharp , bought the ticket on the spot from the bus driver . One way ticket was 7,500 won , return was 15,000 won , ferry ticket to nami island & visa 10,000 per person . We reached Nami island 11am . The bus journey was comfortable, free coffee drinks onboard . Once arrive we go direct to take the ferry over to Nami which was a short journey . It was a beautiful island . Spend around 2 hours here and head next to take the city tour bus to petite France . "
Beautiful island with a lot photo spot,"I had been to Nami island in 2011. This is my 2nd time. Past 7 years, the island grows a lot. There are many shops, coffee, and restaurant popped up. The famous photo spot from Winter Sonata is the same. Overall is really good indeed."
Great Experienced in Nami Island,"Its really one of the best travel experienced specially in Nami Island, from climate to beautiful sceneries. special thanks to Jae Won who assisted us in our Tour. A very accomodated person. He make our tour easy and enjoyable. till next tour to Seoul S. K"
Beautiful place,"Very lucky the night before we went to Nami island it snowed, all trees in nami island were covered in white powered snow. Snows falling from the trees made it looks like it's actually snowing. The snow started to melt at noon time and it gets very watery during that time and water droplets kept falling on the trees.We took Metro to Yongsan Station, and from Yongsan Station we took ITX Express(Approx 1hour) to Gapyeong Station. From Gapyeong Station you can either walk(2km) or hire a taxi(5mins, 3,700won) to arrive nami ferry entrance.We arrived early that day and the city tour bus haven't operate so we took the taxi. If the city bus has operated, it's best you buy the bus ticket(1 day pass) for 6,000won if you're planning to go to the other places like petite france, garden of morning calm etc..."
"First snowman village, Unicef child-friendly park, must visit place. ","We never put Nami Island into our winter trip because we thought it is only famous because of Winter Sonata and it isn't children friendly. But while doing our research, we found out that the assumption is wrong. Nami Island is known because of Winter Sonata movie. But not only that, this place was designated the 14th UNICEF child-friendly park in the world and the first in Korea. And for the first time, it has Snowman Village for this winter. Based on that information, we decided to visit this place. When we were there (it's feel like - 24 celcius), everything was covered with snow. Although it was very cold, the kids really enjoyed. They played snowsled, making snow angel, and all kind activities that could be done in winter time. In the middle of this main path, there was a library and indoor playground. We liked it so much. As for foods, we tried lunch boxes and it were very delicious. We really liked this place. We suggest family with young children to visit this place. The entrance fee (including ferry ride) is 10,000 krw for regular, 8,000 krw for senior and teenagers, and 4,000 krw for kids and night visitor. "
Nami: nothing extraordinary ,"Nothing extra ordinary. There’s alot of tourist perhaps because this is the place which some of the korean novelas were shoot. But aside from that, it’s pretty normal. If you want your trip to be a worthit and life changing experience, visit the DMZ and avail the full day tour. "
Worth the Visit - Even During Winter!,"If you love parks, and like walking around, a trip to Nami should be included in your Korea itinerary. My husband and I were there during winter, and despite the -13 deg temp and the blowing winds, we enjoyed our time in Nami, and were able to appreciate its beauty against the snow backdrop. They also had a small sledding hill, where you can try sledding - for free! Another fun thing to do is to try the different food vendors all throughout the park. We found the park food, not only affordable, but delicious as well. "
A must go place; Good place to take pictures,"We booked a tour package to go to this island (go to the trazy.com website). Our tour guide, Andy, was friendly and informative. This is a great place to take pictures. I recommend you to go to this island during autumn, because during winter, there was no flowers and leaves, but the view was still great. There was a halal restaurant with affordable price for Muslims and also a Musolla for Muslims to pray."
Very nice and romantic place,Visited this small island recently and it is a very romantic place for a walk. We took many nice photos and marveled at the nature landscape. there are also a few nice cafes on the island.
Autumn leaves and weather perfect for photography,Your Seoul adventure will not be complete without a visit to NAMI ISLAND•15 minutes ferry transfer from ticket booth to island proper•board an electronic shuttle to go around the island top sites•board a train to go around the garden•on your way back please TRY THE CHICKEN BARBECUE!!! Awesome!
Favorit Place in Korea,"This is the Best tourist destination i've ever visited in my life. It's very beautiful, you can take a picture on every corner of it or you can just enjoying the place by walk and see the nature. I came here on winter, which is one of the best time to visit nami island because when the snow start to fall from the sky, it will be very awesome... oh i really loved it"
Wonderful place,"An absolutely beautiful place must visit if you can spare one day extra except shopping in Seoul. I join the local tour, leave at 8am from Myeongdong and return around 6pm. As most of you know , the island is used for shooting the famous Korean drama Winter Sonata. "
Perfect winter getaway,Nami island is so pretty in winter that every corner is so nice. The vibes given is perfect from a city getaway. We went quite early as there were less crowd. You need to go to Gapyeong station and take a shuttle bus (krw 6.900) or can take a taxi to ferry pier. The shuttle bus is recommended as you can drop by other places as you like. 
Just wow,"Took a day trip to Nami island and what a visit it was. You can either get to the island via ferry or for the thrill seekers a zipline! Fully recommend hiring a bike and cycling around, can truly say it is one of the most tranquil places i have ever had the chance to visit even considering the amount of people that visit everyday"
Fun and a romantic place ,Where winter sonata was filmed... Spend a day here because 4-5 hours is not enough to enjoy this romantic and fun place.Good for family and couples.There are restaurantsSouvenir shopsActivity shopsCafeHistorical billboardsPlayground for kidsBooks for kids Available at the playgroundKept in a character designed book shelves15 mins ferry rideThey also have hotel’s Cabin for rentBike trailsAnd beautiful landscapeGood for photoshootMeditation and Alot more... :) 
Crowded place.,Tour is average but the drawback are it is extremely full packed and when you are with some rude tourists who doesn't speak english it will be a disaster.
Beautiful island,"We took trains than ITX-Cheongchun from Cheongnyangni Station to Gapyeong Station (need to purchase separate tickets when change to ITX as it was a different transport company-we did'nt know and got fined by the inspector). From the station took a 10min taxi ride (4,000 won-better to give exact amount as driver don't give you change back) to reach the wharf. Purchase the ticket and board the ferry to the island. It is a beautiful island where you can walk around or cycle around. We walked around and enjoy the beautiful scenaries. An enjoyable trip"
A Must-See Stunning Island in Korea,"We visited Nami late-November, hence the weather is quite cold. A very calming part of my South Korea Tour. You have three options to roam this huge island either through coaster, bicycle or walking. Remember to get a map before starting your Nami adventure especially if you'll visit it without a tour guide. We were able to see those vibrant yellow leaves of Gingko and orange maple leaves, a great backdrop for picture taking. If you were able to watch Winter Sonata kdrama, you'll appreciate the place even more. I'll definitely visit Nami again, once I'm back in South Korea."
So many tourists,"I visited nami island during weekend period, there is so many tourist there which make it less romantic than it should.There is many food stalls which sells at fair price point, so compare before you decide to sit and eat at a restaurant.Try to avoid minimarket store near fery dock at first point of arrival inside nami island, the lady staff there was rude. And price is very high. 4000₩ for an instant coffee? That is a rip off. Better to look for a restaurant in nami island and enjoy your meal along with whatever you decide to drink. At least you'll get warmer welcome.Scenery is beautifull, with so many photo spot. But since it was weekend, there is so many footprints along the snow, and looks somehow dirty.I would try again visiting nami island during weekdays period, and see if there is less tourists in that period will make it better."
The snowy scenery is AMAZING!,"You must see this island!I went to Nami-island and Vivaldi Park tour package at once.Recommend a tour package.I got a 20-percent discount on the Baynaru site.It is famous for its shooting spot of Winter Sonata.If you like snow, I recommend it."
Day tour to Nami Island,"We went to South Korea mid October, and the leaves are turning its color. I was hoping to see the bright ginkgo leaves (yellow to orange) but it was bright yellow green when we went. I think you will appreciate more of the place if you are a koreanovela fan, which am not. But the place was great."
NAMIss ko! ,"Nami Island is definitely a relaxing place to visit! You can commune with nature and be totally blown away with the amazing views, colorful leaves, flowers and it's breathtaking views! One piece of advice though, be prepared with light snacks and water because it will take you a whole day or even more to enjoy what it has to offer!Kamsahamnida Nami Island for the wonderful and unforgettable experience! "
Beautiful place!,I love Nami Island. The scenic landscape and beauty of this island is truly admirable and worth visiting.
"Nami Island, location of Winter Sonata Soap","Nami Island is a must visit attraction, if you love Korean Television Soap, because it was the location for Winter Sonata. There are a lot of interesting areas. Also there are a couple of cute, but wild animals, so approach with caution. Animals such as Ostriches, Squirrel, Bunny/Rabbits, Magpies, Peacocks, and Cats."
Unforgettable & romantic visit,"The movie scenes from Winter Sonata were displayed here abundantly made me curious about the drama storyline :) It was covered in snow when we visited in January, we came via zipline which I glad we did despite the cold weather, it wasn't bad at all. They also set up snow mountain where you slide down using the provided slides. It was so fun! The place was so beautiful especially the area where the trees all lined up in straight line. "
Scenic Island with Gorgeous Views,"This place is worth visiting any time of the year, though in winter it becomes magical with frozen lakes and snow and a very good feel to the place. A must visit for fans of Winter Sonata, plenty of restaurants and activities within the island itself to fill your time."
Lovely,"This is a must see. Takes more than an hour from Myeong-dong, but it's all worth it. Lots of trees. Lots to do. Good food in the area. One of the best places to go when in South Korea."
feel a romantic winter here,"strolling around nami island for 2 or 3 hrs is such a memorable journey.take photos on trees, try a hot latte on a cold breeze winter.that was minus 15C that time.but still worth to go again and again"
Romantic place with couple,"This place has such a romantic vibes. From the lining trees to the lake surround and the caffe's. This place is popular because of the winter sonata drama setting. Many visitor came here especially on the weekend. Easy to reach by bus (you can buy package which including a return ticket, entrance and ferry) or by train (ktx)"
A beautiful place indeed,"We are just in awe of how beautiful this place was. The color of the leaves was spectacular. Just amazed how the trees were maintained and cared for. For me it is best to go here during fall season. We ride a train from yongsan to gapyeong station, then there will be a bus from the gapyeong station to Nami ferry station. You have an option to take a ferry or a zipline for adrenaline rush In Autumn, Nami island is poetry. Indeed the island is a poetry "
Excelent at nami island,Excellent viewMany ice in the hereMinus derajad at nami island. Many visitors in Nami Island. Like this island 
To visit in any season,"I think this place is worth of a visit in any season. I visited this place twice this year and in different season and all I can say is that this place is stunning. Make sure to wear your OOTD's with comfy shoes and your cameras. You will walk here a lot but it's also possible to rent a bicycle for those who have the biking skills. Here's a secret that I would like to share to you guys, I learned to ride a bike in Nami Island, a total beginner. lol!"
Winter is the best time to visit,"Namiseom in winter is a dream visit. While activities in the island is all about walking around , the place is a good place to let your inner photographer out. There are a number of food outlets , but I failed to try them out. A must visit in Korea."
Excellent Tourist spot for Muslims!,Great environment!Great Halal Food!Comfortable and spacious prayer room!Tons of photo-worth spots!
A great place!!,"Was very surprised by this island. didn't expect much as it was a man made islandIt was a really nice and quaint island, even rented the bicycles to have the feel. Though the winter sonata figurines are quite tacky, the shops are really nice selling those snow man postcards!Even a bank which issue name island coin, was really interesting.Will strongly recommend this island!"
Sureal,Nami island in winter is like a wonderland its snow fields and has a winter sled. We had a trip together with with this suggest to take a half day tour instead of combining it for 3-tours so that you can enjoy the island more.
Love is in the air,"We went to explore Nami Island as we celebrate our 100th Monthsary. The place is amazingly beautiful! The restaurant we tried caters to Asian and we so love the food.Should you get tired walking, you may opt to try renting bicycles or simply rest for a while and just enjoy the scenic view. Would love to come back and try the hotel inside this very island."
Zipwire,"i give all the credit to the zipwire, I like it so much and you should try it. Other than this, it is a very boring island with nothing to do but to walk around trees and some ice sculptures. You are also under the mercy of ferry mood to get out of the island. Departure time is not Organised Nor known. You can find some restaurant and coffee. Don't waste your time if you do not want to take the zipwire, nature can be seen in many other places without Travelling to nami."
Nami Island during winter,Nami island just looks so diffrent during winter and springLike winter nami island the best as there is also snow sledding activity too
Simple but Lovely,"The place is simple but truly lovely. Lots of nice paths, and with good timing, you can take plenty of photos with few or no people in view. If you want to save a few bucks, you might want to check out the numerous dakgalbi (spicy stir-fried chicken) restaurants near the ferry terminal.Aside from some eateries, there are also crafts and souvenir shops in Nami. On our visit 1st week of December, entry fee was still at 8000 won."
Nami in Winter <3,"went there at the start of winter and everything was almost covered in snow and snow sculptures by nature are starting to form. Getting there on our own from Myeongdong thru KTX then the island bus was easy breezy and the ferry to Nami Island was spacious despite a bunch of fellow Asian tourists trying to experience cold like me. :) A giant ice sculpture made by mother nature welcomed us and it was amazing (picture attached). Walking around the island with snow was a bit hard because falling on your butt is very easy thus it is recommended to wear the appropriate snowshoes when going there on winter. :) The view of the frozen lake is amazing, felt like a dream :) Must visit on different seasons probably to be able to experience Nami in different colors. :)"
You WILL love this place,"This is one of the most romantic places for couples! I went during winter with the help of Klook. If I come to South Korea again, I will come back Nami Island again maybe in Autumn. Ferries waiting time frequency is reasonable."
Nami is for me!,A beautiful island not far from Seoul and a fun and relaxing way to spend a day or two. It is family friendly with activities for all. It is worth the trip and bring your camera! Cheers!
"Winter Sonata Famous Attraction Place, A Must See Island!","We went there on a Sunday morning. Took the train from Seoul, bus from Yapcheong Station & ferry to Nami Island. Great view with beautiful scenery. It was snowing the night before so the place was even better. The island wasn't that big so you can easily wander around by foot. To those adventure seeking person, they can opt to go to the island using the Zipwire ride. Adrenaline thrill is a definite thing! We just took the ferry ride, enjoying the cold breeze & beautiful view from the ferry. We get to play in the snow & enjoy our time there. A must see place!"
Beautiful winter scenery ,Allow about 2 hours to slowly tour this windy island and take beautiful pictures. Toilets are clean with several eateries. Worth a visit and do check out their zip line (which looks interesting) during the sunnier months.
Photo hunter,"I visited here in early december and it was so cold but everything was worth a view. Take photograph in every spot and i really didn’t any photo filter since the winter color is so beautiful. Explore more of the places if you really want to di photo hunt with a different angle with others. There’re also some restaurant inside the area, but my favorite is the one outside the area, i forgot the name but it was a roasted chicken with korean style of eating"
Beautiful scenery during winter,It has to be the most memorable place gor me in korea..beautiful scene...it’s just like winter sonata the korean drama during winter...great for outdoor pictures..waiting time for the ferry is acceptable..
Beautiful place,I visited Nami island first week of December and it was already winter time in Korea. The fountains and ponds were already frozen but it still has it charms despite the freezing weather. I would recommend going there though during autumn as the changing colors of the leaves would be an attraction. There is an long stretch of gingko trees and maple trees there. Rent a bike! 
Magical island,"An hour trip from Seoul to country side of Korea. An island half moon shaped, accessible by a tour ship. All I can say it’s magical place, you can tour the island many ways either walking, bicycle, riding a shuttle guided tour. The island is surrounded a river back drop of the mountain. There is a resort within the island, wish I stayed over night.Just a wonderful place for families, couple or solo trip. Tourist and Koreans love to visit this island away from hustle and bustle of Seoul. A place to relax and enjoy nature."
Beautiful scenery from the love of winter ,"The beautiful leaves and trees, colourful autumn. Experience the freeze and breeze. The love of winter "
End Nov - Missed the Autumn Foliage,"We took the 7.15am ITX-Cheongchun from Cheongnyangni Station to Gapyeong Station. After a 10min taxi ride (4,000 won), we arrived at the wharf at about 8am. Great! No crowds. Just what I wanted.There was a cold snap (first snow) the week before. Hence almost all the trees in the Metasequoia Lane and Ginko Tree Lane were bare when we visited in end November. Nevertheless we still found some red leaves for a nice picture, particularly along the riverside paths near the bungalows.Do note that if you are visiting this early, there will be small “maintenance” vehicles on the paths. We had to wait a little for it to turn away before we can take our pictures.The bike centre was closed. As there was ice on the ground, staff told us it would be dangerous to ride. Instead we were told to try the Sky Train. My mobile phone actually dropped out of my pocket during the ride! Lol!The UNICEF trains at Central Station were also not operating. But by the time we walked back to the Wharf Station, it has just started for the day.We left Nami Island at about 11.30am. Many people had started to stream in by then, and the island lost its tranquility. Visit early if you dislike crowds!"
Peaceful place ,Love the atmosphere of the place once you arrive. The beautiful green trees and picturesque sight! A squirrel was there entertaining us with its acorn. So cute! There's even a swimming pool area. 
Relaxing island,"This small island is serene, trees lining-up and leaves are beautiful since it's autumn. The weather is quite cold in the middle of november, so even though it's clear weathers it feels freezing.We'll find statues of the 2 main characters of the drama hugging. It's very obvious that the island is associated with winter sonata.Finding food is not hard, there are some restaurants in the island, some coffe shops and also souvenirs stores."
Fiesta of Colors,"It was a cold morning in Incheon, South Korea when we were talking at the breakfast table at the hotel and decided to go to Nami Island. Armed with the google map, we embark to see this place our Korean friends dubbed as a “majestic show of colors”Using google, we try to find our way. We took a two and a half hours bus ride from a bus station just outside Incheon International Airport to Gapyeong. From there we took a half hour taxi ride to Gyeonggi-do. And that’s it, we reach the famous Naminara Republic, just a boat ride away from the island home of the most colorful set of trees we have ever seen, the Nami Island. After paying our “entry visa” fee of Korean Won 8,000 that includes our boat fare, we hopped in the boat for the short ride from the wharf to the island to start our colorful journey. Red color leaves on one side, red ones on the other side and golden yellow leaves on yet another side populate the island. It was a fiesta of colors in this garden-like pieceof land surrounded by water. A place to see and enjoy. It is good enough to be a natural setting where some Koreanovela scenes were shoot and filmed."
Awesome Attraction,"If you are a fan of the hit Korean Drama 'Winter Sonata', this is a MUST.It brings a lot of memories from the drama. Now, the island is vibrantnl with eateries, souvenir shops and attractions which include performances, kimchi making festival. It also boasts flags and landmarks from many countries e.g. Merlion (Singapore).The lotus ponds are thriving with fishes. And there are a few other animals there too. Hotels and cottages are also available if you plan to stay over at the island.I have attached a picture i took along the banks of the island by the cottages and the directions if you are adventurous. It snowed at the time of my visit.The tour bus to the ferry wharf and other attractions is just outside the train station. It runs on specific schedule. It can be found at the bus-stops. So plan your visit well. Cash payment to the driver as you board the bus. T-Card not accepted.I ate Mozzarella and Tomato Panini sandwich at the island from an eatery called Gomok. It was delish!!!!"
Amazingly beautiful,"Simply Love it!! Went last week with family while it was snowing and it was very beautiful,also a very romantic spot for couples and a spot to take countless number of photos!!A must go if u ever visit korea!!"
Memorable Day Trip,"From Seoul to Gapyeong Station. Take a shuttle bus to Nami island. (Namiseom). Drop at Nami island and purchase the nami wharf for entry to nami. Lovely place and cooling weather. Especially when visit during mid autumn. Almost leaves fall but still there is gingko tree for u to take a snap there. *ps: try to avoid during weekend. To get a perfect pic w/o lots of passerby. For Muslim ppl, you can dine in to Asian Cuisine restaurant there. The price there is a bit pricey. Eg, Fried Rice with 3 chicken wings can cost roughly 16000w -18000w. Rice with Bulgogi is nice. For souveniers try entering the snowman place. 5th pic attached. "
It is worth a trip!,"After travelling to Seoul, a visit to Nami Island give another perspective of what South Korea able to offers. From big metropolitan city to the scenic island, it gives all the nature lovers and photographers time to capture the wonder of the island. From history and nature to music and sculptures, the experience is just mesmerizing. "
Must visit Nami island during Autumn!,The trees are colorful and amazing. You must first visit Petite France then The garden of the morning calm lastly Nami Island so that you can explore the beautiful surroundings. 
"Romantic, Memorable and Perfect Getaway at Nami Island","If there's one memorable attraction or place I will remember for the rest of my life after visiting Korea it will be Nami Island in Chuncheon Gangwon-do. It was early October when me and my parents/sister visited it quite late already past lunch although our trip was short approximately 4 hours it was a moment to remember. The atmosphere, nature and ambience has its own stamp of peace, romance, and beauty that will last for a lifetime. Just an hour's away from the bustling capital city of Seoul thru Yongsan Station then via ITX Train to Gapyeong Station. From Gapyeong you have 2 options: You could take a taxi (approx 5000 KRW) if you only plan to visit Nami Island (recommended if you're a group of 4) and the other option is the Gapyeong Tour Bus (6000 KRW) which will take you to different attractions including but not limited to Nami Island and Petit France. First bus is 0900 and last bus is 19:30 and interval is 5 to 15 mins per stop. For us we took the bus but we didn't get a chance to vist Petit France but still worht it visiting Nami only. Once you land in Nami Island Station you may walk to Gapyeong Wharf then take the zipline or ferry to Nami Island. We took the ferry and it costs 8,000 KRW which included admission to Nami Island and back. It was Golden week and a lot of tourists are there but the area is spacious that you wouldn't have any issues bumping into each other or having some photo bombers on the background. After alighting at Nami Station around 1 PM we decided to take some quick Italian lunch at Winter Sonata cafe (yes you heard it right). Following lunch we brought the tickets for the return ferry and for the entrance to Nami Island. The ferry is big and spacious and you the option to walk on its side to view the surroundings of the lake (caused by the rise of Han River) onwards Nami Island or Namiseom. All in all the trip took about 10 mins and we disembarked on the island. There are many features and attractions inside the island to name the popular ones - the Metasequoia footpath, many monuments, signs, and posters in dedication to the Korean drama Winter Sonata which made Namiseom even more famous, a train ride, cafes, souvenir shops, huge grass field in the middle of the island, ostrich farm, huge bell for blessings, the Nami mascot - the snowman are everywhere and several monument dedications to some friendship countries with Korea. Lodging facilities are also available for people who wish to stay. We especially enjoyed the bench between the lake and the huge grass field, the Ostrich farm, and of course the Metasequoia tree path. We tried some red bean paste snack and Korean vanilla ice-cream while resting for a bit. And of course our shots are moments we would never forget and there to remember for a lifetime. After 4 hours in the island we decided to leave and the memories of it stamped within us. Even if you are single, with couple or with your family/friends the experience with Namiseom is with the nature itself how this tiny island made a big impact in inspiring the beauty of nature within your life - it's priceless and worth a visit."
Awesome place,Me and my friend went there last Oct. 17. We were amazed at how beautiful the place is. Our 3 hour tour is not enough. I plan to stay the whole day touring and enjoy scenery on my next trip. This is my #1 go to place when I visit South Korea again.
Don't Forget to Go Biking,"Nami Island is truly a dreamy place and continues to to take your breath away. There is also nothing better to see the island on bike. Rent a bike and ride around and look for the money shots where you get to take a picture of the trees, the beautiful mountains and the water. Each season gives you a different look and feel of the place so if you have the time and resources, try to visit this place again."
perfect autumn,"You really need to visit Nami if you come to Korea on autumn. This place are just perfect, not only all the nature scene you will see but you can also visit various little museum. We even need to miss our other destination because we spend too many time in nami. "
Really gorgeous island,"Went here on a weekday and it was not crowded. Absolutely gorgeous island with its wide array of autumn colours, really clean and well-kept, very peaceful to just walk around and take many many beautiful pictures! It is really easy to get here from Seoul without paying extra to take tour. Although there are many people, you can still find lots of quiet spots for rest and photos. Squirrels are everywhere."
A beautiful place for rest and photos,"We decided to stay one night on the island to avoid the crowds. Nami is always full of people so for those who prefer fresh air, quietness and great shots, try to stay on Nami at least one night. The island is beautiful in all seasons but we are lucky to get there when all leaves turn yellow and red. We even did not have time to go all places on the island although it is not big as there are so many beautiful places for photos. The weather in the end Oct is chilling. Good restaurants on the island but the night is cold so make sure warm clothes are available. If you just want to visit day-trip, try to arrive the island by ferry at 7.30 otherwise you can only see waves of people after 9am. "
What more can i say?,"Beautiful island, breathtaking view, romantic feeling and the cleanest island in the world. Most suitable for newly weds, couples that are in love and do take your wedding pictures here.Overall, so korean dramas look and feel."
"Trees, trees and views!","For my tour, Nami Island was the second attraction to visit. We went there by boat, almost walked until the end of the island and came back (because of limited time for the tour). The island is absolutely beautiful, with trees everywhere and awesome views! I managed to take so many nice photos here! There are restaurants and shops on the island, so grab a snack if you ever visit!I don't have any bad experiences on the island since I only spent around an hour here... which is absolutely not enough! I will come back for sure and next time I will at least spend 2 hours here!"
Fall Foliage in Nami Island!,An unforgettable place in South Korea. We're lucky to have seen the full bloom of the trees as autumn gives way to winter!
Romantic island 😙,"The island's so so beautiful. It's perfect for all genaration as couple, single, family, friend even alone. "
beautiful!,beautiful and very well kept. enjoyed zip-lining into the island which costs 38 000 Korean won per person which also includes the ferry trip out of the island. island was beautiful especially the autumn foliage. lots of tourists though. enjoyed taking all the beautiful sceneries. doesn't matter whether you are into Korean dramas or not. well worth the visit. best to get there early to avoid the crowd. we reached by 9.20am and managed to avoid the crowd that arrived after. left the island by noon after taking abundant of beautiful pictures
Expectations vs reality,The place was beautiful and cold when we get there. Too crowded but its clean. Love the autumn feels when we were there.
Nice place,This place is so huge. I suggest you to come here early in the morning to avoid crowded. You could take a ferry or ride a zipwire to go to nami island. I rode the zipwire to go to nami island instead of ferry. The view is sooo superb. 
NAMI miss kita!!! ,It's my second time here and I must say that it's a pure beauty to behold during autumn. I love how the colors blend in and how it creates a dramatic and charismatic painting of nature. 
Beautiful sights in the autumn but too many tourists,I went there in autumn. The island's scenery is beautiful but it was difficult to take good photos because there would be someone in every shot.
Beautiful autumn colours,"The island was fun to travel to and we took the zip-line to the island which made it even more exciting. The island was beautiful, especially because of all the trees changing colours. The only down side was that we waited for 2 hours to get off the island as their was too many people and only 2 ferries. Other than that it was a wonderful experience "
My fave place in South Korea,"Always on my list, my 3rd time here.Autumn is may fave season so far because of the colors.Dont go on weekends it pretty crowded. Come in the morning too."
Unique but Crowded,This place is so unlike any other place almost made as artists island with lots of trees with autumn leaves and great views .You must have time at hand to enjoy the island .Some people take zipline instead of ferry to reach from the mainland .Great place to be
Beautiful during Autumn but dont go on a weekend,"We got lost along the way to Nami island so we got to Gapyeong at around noon on a Sunday. Just our luck that everyone decided they wanted to go to Nami island that day. The traffic was unmoving and very rarely did the buses came. So we decided to walk to the wharf. It wasnt unpleasant to walk as the weather was cool.The scenery was beautiful during Autumn, especially the famous tree lined path was so gorgeous when the trees turn yellow. But again, there were so much people that it was impossible to take a shot without other people invading your picture."
A Fall Sonata bring cacophony of colors,"For Asian and other followers of the Moonlight Sonata Korean telenovela, Nami Island is a must-see shrine. While I have not been a follower of this series I have heard of it and my eldest sister was excited to see what the Island offers. Reachable by ferry (after about an hour trip from Seoul) Nami Island visitors are greeted by two snow characters. From there you are free to wander and discover what history from the thousands of years past you need to relive. Or find a coffee shop to write about your travel. Yes, there was a cafe and the pastries and lunch items were varied as they were good.There was an ongoing musical presentation by ethnic and local bands, which give the place a melodious atmosphere that blends with the foliage."
"Romantic & Cozy Island near Gapyeong-gun, Gyeonggi-do","Namiseom or Nami Island is very famous since K-Drama, Winter Sonata, came to shoot here. It's very romantic & cozy island. It's good to visit for every season. But my favorite seasons are late spring and autumn. All tress & flowers are beautiful. You should arrive early and enjoy the moment before big group of tours arrive."
Picturesque,"Tip: Get the earliest boat trip to the island. You can access the island by ferry (special rate for foreigners) or if you're feeling adventurous, you can zipline across the water. At around 9am, this place starts to get crowded so I suggest get the earliest trip so you can enjoy the scenery or find pockets of space where you won't get too many people passing by as you take photos. A tour around the island can be accomplished by foot, but I opted to rent a bicycle since my time here was limited. The island has lots of food options, from the sit-down restaurant to food tents and stalls, selling everything you could want.This is a beautiful place. If you love nature then you will enjoy it here."
Beautiful place,"This place is really beautiful. Admission fee is less than 10,000 won including ship price. It is an hour and a half away from Seoul and it is a movie drama shooting place. This place is open from 8 am to 9 pm"
Autumn is the best season to visit here,"The yellow red autumn leaves are sooooo beautiful !2 hours 15 mins is enough to explore the place with all the selfies, group photos and shopping."
Nice location but overhyped,For a Wednesday it was very crowded and not relaxing and tranquil as advertised. So many school kids making selfies only.Autumn is a nice time to visit with the coloring of the tree leaves.
Lovely island and very tranquil... loving the autumn leaves!,"Although it was a Saturday when we visited with 2 young children; 4 and 6 year old, it was not too crowded and very tranquil. The ferry ride was great and families who wanna bring your kids’ strollers along will have no problem. And at Nami Island itself, can also push the strollers around.It was a small island but we did not cover the whole island. Was just strolling around amidst the autumn’s maple trees and basking in the lovely warm yellow and orange and brown colours from the Fall’s trees.Not much for kids to do but my children had fun picking maple leaves from the ground and running around, enjoying the cool autumn weather on this lovely Saturday."
Positives and Negatives,"It was a lovely island, very big to explore. Can spend the whole day there. Bring a mat and find a peaceful spot and have a picnic if you want. I went at the start of fall, trees were not yellow/orange/red as i hoped for but it was still worthwhile to visit. Easy to get to via ITX then bus then ferry. I did not opt for the shuttle buses from Myeongdong because the timing coming back is early. I highly suggest to purchase your ITX tickets both ways in advance to get seats. Going back to Seoul, i had to take the multi stops train because i ran out of tickets for ITX.There were plenty of restaurants but as expected, prices were steep. Bulgogi with rice costs 12,000krw - that is twice the average price to give you an idea.As all tourist spots, there were a LOT of tour groups. They were so freaking loud and have no manners whatsoever. Some of them littered and some acted like they own the place. If there is a queue for photo opportunities like the Winter Sonata spots, they will cut you in. In the ferry, even if you are already sitting, they will pull you up so they can sit down, they dont even ask. Sigh."
"Relaxing, and great scenery","If you want to see the turning color of autumn leaves, this is the place. They have really well maintained the place with different theme inside Nami island. Aside from rows of trees, you can also see some great crafts, special portrait, or kids section to entertain the young ones. There are several restaurants inside this place, you’ll have choices from Korean food, Chinese, Western, and street food. If you have extra day in Seoul, this place is worth a visit. Tourists gets special rate of Kwon 8000. Just present your passport. "
"Average ""island"" far away from seoul",Located far away from seoul. 1. Recommended transport is you are going on your own : it rail and not the normal metro as it takes a log ride2.Attractions : nothing awesome just like a normal park to me with some scenic trees with colorful colors expecily during autumn period.3. Serene of the area spoilt noise pollution by speedboat activities 4. Too crowded if you visit on weekends5. Quite a hassle waiting for the public bus to connect to the train station 
Very calming island,"I saw the picture of this island in the internet, it was look nice. But when I was visiting them my self..... It was so beautiful, I love it, especially when autumn about to start, the leaves starting to change color. They have cafe n resto there, so don't worry about your belly. Unfortunately I just have a little time. I wanted to explore the whole island and soaking it's beauty. "
Worthwhile Visit,"We didn't book the ITX train to Gapyeong as we wanted some flexibility in our travel. By the time we decided to book the ITX, there was no available ticket. Instead, we decided to travel via the Seoul Metro, which happened to be a cheaper option. The trip wasn't that straight forward because we had to backtrack as there was no direct connection from Kwangwoon University Line 1 to Line G. Therefore, the only approach is to travel to Hoegi (Line 1) switch to Line G to Sangbong, and then switch to another train in Sangbong to Gapyeong. Once we were at Gapyeong, it's recommended that you take a taxi to the Nami ferry terminal. Ticket is 8,000 won per adult for a round trip. I suggest you have your meal before or after the trip to Nami Island, as food and drinks are expensive on the island."
Nami Island,"The full day trip was nice and well oriented, the time division for each place was just right; 2 hrs for Morning Calm Garden, 4 hrs for Nami Island and finally 1.5 hrs for Petite France. Jaypit was very helpful explaining the attraction spots for each place."
Late Autumn Trip at Nami,"If you are a group of 4 it might be a better option to find a car and a driver. It saves time too. We went there in the morning and in mid-November last year. It was crowded but not too crowded that it will be difficult to find a good shot of nice scenes.The colors were pretty as some trees turned crimson and yellow. Fallen leaves gave a dramatic effect as well. The sun perfectly hit the trees. However there was a small pond the looked kinda depressing as it looked like it was an intro for winter.The trip was fun when we all rented a bike. After riding, we found a spot to sit down and chill as well. Nice scene, cool breeze, relaxing and it was really nice in the morning. There were some kids on a school trip, we also some couples taking their pre-nuptial or maybe post (not really sure) in the right spots. I think the island is too big to be explored by foot so renting a bike would be fun and will allow you to see each corner."
Fun and beautiful place to visit,"I am glad that we stopped to visit this place. The ferry was very quick to the island while my husband took the adventure zip line with my kids. It was expensive but they had a blast. It was from a very tall tower. Once on the island there was beautiful scenery, fun sculptures, and other strange but fun things to see like ostriches. We did have lunch on the island, which was expensive, but we liked it. There were tons of other things to pay to do on the island that we did not do. It seemed like a lot of tourist trap things, but there was plenty to do aside from the 'extras', so we didn't feel like we missed out by just walking around. We would like to visit again, and even possibly stay overnight on the island in one of the cabins. "
A must visit when in South Korea,"Another beautiful place in South Korea. Its a must visit for family. Even people with handicap and seniors can enjoy as they provided free use of wheel chairs. The tour of the place will take about 2-3 hours. So many activities to do and you have places to relax as well. Once you reach the dock, you have 3 ways to reach the islands itself. Theres a free 5-minute boat ride and 2 zipline routes. One will lead you directly lead you to the island but you have to queue for the ride. About 45 mins -1 hr waiting time and costs about ₩40,000 While the express zipline is muh faster but more expensive but it will drop you off in another island and another boat ride to nami island itself. If you plan to spend a whole day at nami island then i suggest to ride the zipline as you can get to see nami in another perspective"
Early autumn at Nami Island,"Nami Island is actually located in the middle of wide river, not at the sea. We need about one hour trip from Seoul to Nami Island. There are many beautiful trees such as mapple, pine, ginko, etc. There are many restaurants, one of them is Asian cuisine restaurant that serves halal food. We try bulgogi and it tastes good. We chose one day tour only, but if you want to enjoy more, there is a cottage you can stay.Mid autumn will be perfect time to visit."
Beautiful island to visit,"Nami island is about 1.5 hours from city. The ferry ride to island is less than 5 mins. The island is big with interesting spots for nice photos. The island was the place where winter sonata korean tv show was filmed. You can spend leisure walks around for 3 hours. On the way back, we passed by petite france, nice quaint littlle france for an hour tour."
Perfect Sunday ,"Parking at the ferry lot is 4,000w. Go thru ""immigration"" and catch the quick scenic ferry to Nami. I was concerned about other comments about the crowds and being a tourist trap but I'm so glad we came. Sunday wasn't too bad as far as crowds...lots of space for everyone to enjoy. You can rent bikes, 2wheel scooters, catch a small train, or walk the park. There were even cottages to rent over looking the water! Don't miss the kids library! We Loved this place..."
A small island for relax,"People visited there due to the famous Korean tv drama. I didn't watch that drama. So, may not be able to associate the view with the drama scene. But it's still a nice stroll in this small island. It got trees, animals around. You can enjoy the nature. Not worth to only come to this island all the way from Seoul. But, if you go for other nearby spots, e.g. railbike, sure it's good to drop by this small island as well."
must visit,"after back a month from Korea,i still miss the weather the scene and the environment there.Nami island really a beautiful island.you can a two three hours thrre.the scene there is awesome and romantic.if go there wif couple,can cycling there tgther.the greenery scene as i went there in spring...u can enjoy the scene with the nice weather there..a beautiful island"
You should visit if you stay in Chunchun,Walk and stay in ChunchunHere is great place to stay in Nami island.This is great for kids and romantic couple.
Amazing place ,"First things first - allot a whole day when visiting Nami Island. Going there from Seoul (Myeondong) area takes a while especially if you plan to do what we did which was to take public transport all the way. Expect a LOT of train changes, you may get lost along the way (we did. We rode the wrong train thus we forfeited the tickets we bought and had to buy new set of tickets), and you'll be tired by the time you get to the port going to Nami, but believe me the journey was worth it. The place is beautiful. And huge. Rent a bicycle if you'd like to cover more grounds at a shorter time, or just stroll around and take your time. There are several cafes and restaurants around so you can take breaks, the ground is flat so leisurely walk is easy, there are so many nooks for a photo shoot so that can take a lot of your time, and if you end up staying til sunset, you get one amazing view and less crowd around you. Reserve this day as your personal R&R. "
Tour to Nami Island and Petite France,"Nami Island was just an ordinary small island, and we were given 2 hours to walk around to take photos. The tour guide Brian did his job of showing us the Island before we were left to walk around. It’s a relaxing place but nothing spectacular and pretty pricey tour. We had lunch and the barbecue chicken was very nice. Next to Petite France and we were given one hour to walk around, however there was nothing to see here besides just a short row of European houses. If you like visiting different places, then take this tour but it’s pricey for what you get and nothing spectacular. "
Away from the city ,"It’s a relaxing place to be in that’s away from the city and you can breathe in some fresh air... nice scenery and lovely ferry ride to the island. If you are thinking of zip line, do book your tickets online early if not be prepared to wait for 3 hours or so. Do wear comfortable shoes too. Couple of things could be improved.Frequency of the shuttle bus from Gapyeong Station to Nami Island can be more since there are so many people. We wanted to rent a bicycle but realize the rental center is in the middle of the island which means you have already covered half the island from walking. They should have it near the entrance which makes it more worthwhile. "
A must place to visit when at Seoul,"Spend 3-4 hours here. A beautiful & romantic place to take a pictures. You can rent a bike if plan to cover all the island, basically just a small island. You still can cover it within 2 hours by foot.But if you travel with kids, it might be a problem so you can hoop on the electric bike.Lot of restaurant here so no worries if you need some meals."
Perfect get-away from big city Seoul,"About 2 hours both train and taxi ride from Seoul. We took trains of different lines and finally taxi from our hostel in Sinchon area in Seoul. But the train trip was worth it all cutting thru Korean countryside in early autumn. This tiny island, modeled like an independent country, hence known as Naminara Republic, with breathtaking lake views, unique library and some historical story about General Nami is everything both a little kid as well as an adult need . I would say if you are in Seoul with a spare day, this is the place to be. No mistake about it."
wonderful walk,"This is one place for a really nice walk even if you are not a fan of the korean show that made this island popular. There are activities for kids and adults alike. There are a lot of picture perfect spots. Whichever path you choose, you are left with wonder as you wander thru the trees :) I think it would really be good to visit at different seasons as each season would offer different picture perfect walks ;) Tip: better to go early in the morning to avoid the crowd. good to ride the unicef train going up then have a leisurely walk down to the wharf. If you do not have a bag or stuff to carry, try the zipline going to the island. The island also has guest houses."
Before and After the Revamp,"I've been there quite a couple of times before the place was revamped. Recently I went again after the revamped and thought I prefer the before. It became so touristy with so many restaurants, multi countries displays, hotel, etc. I thought it lost touch with nature."
So Peaceful!,"Nami Island was so peaceful and calming, it was never overcrowded when we went! It was delightful riding the bikes through the island which i recommend if you want to see the island it its entirety, especially if you're short on time! Walking through the trees and seeing the wild animals were also a treat! Definitely nice to take a rest and take in everything around you!"
Beautiful great outdoor close to Seoul,"If you want to get away from the highly commercial Seoul and looking for open space this is the place for you. Particularly during autumn when the whole island change color. From Yongsan Station, take the ITX-Cheongchun train to Gapyeong (加平) Station. The trip will take roughly 60 minutes. You can also take the normal metro but it will take more than 90 mins!! From Gapyeong Station, take the “Gapyeong Tour Bus” to Nami Island Station. (5 minutes). From Nami Island Station, walk to Gapyeong Wharf (2 minutes). Then take ferry to Nami Island. I walked around for three hours and there are plenty of places for photo shots"
Went there For Halal Food,"I went there during week day, so it was not so crowded. I purposely went there for halal food. The food was delicious. My kid enjoy the animal watching there, there were Ostriches, peacocks, squirrels, rabbits running around the island. There was also a train ride, really good for kids."
So so,"The island is big and the ferry ride is ok, but the island itself is a mix of tacky tourist places coupled with a few nice park areas. I suppose if you come from environments where green space is scarce, this may appeal, but for any European or North American traveler this will be a disappointment. Crowded and truly nothing that makes you go WOW. "
Beautiful Autumn here,"This place is very popular and made for tourists. We took a train to Gapyeong station and then took the hop on hop off Gapyeong shuttle bus for KRW 6000/pax. One of the stops was Nami Island. The place was full of tourists. We had to buy a ticket costing KRW 8000/pax and was issued a ticket in the form of a ""passport"". We took a ferry for a very short trip across to Nami Island. The island goes by the name of an imaginary country called Naminara Republic. It was quite nice to walk around the island. Many events are held here. We liked the autumn colours here and it was very beautiful."
Chill out here,A small island that you can take time here. Many resturants and cafe in the island with natural environment. Good place for take a break.
"Beautiful ""Winter Sonata"" Island",We came to this Island due to my wife's love with Korean drama. This is the famous place where the Winter Sonata was filmed. It is a wonderful place with tall trees lined up everywhere. There are many photo op places on this island.We came here during summer and it was so beautiful.
Come here when autum,we came here at the end of autum and begining of winter. its quite cold and windy. but the place is breathtaking. its so big you need more than 1 hour to go around in this island. they provide you place to eat and also coffee shop is everywhere. for Muslims dont worry they also provide you musollah. its very convenient.
A dream land !! must visit !,"Took a day tour to nami island. Its a wonderful place to visit. People mostly come here because of its fame due to a Korean drama "" winter sonata "". I had not seen the drama still I found this place very interesting. There are so many perfect spots for photography. Spent there approximately 2 hours admiring the beauty of nature, visiting souvenir shops and enjoying some local cuisine. One can spend the entire day here with their loved ones and friends. The way to this island is via a five mins ferry ride. There is another way too to enter this island and that is through zip lining. I took the ferry and my husband chose the zip lining. Overall its a must visit when in south Korea."
Must go beautiful island!,Beautiful place mostly filled with tourists. Spent almost 2hours exploring most of the photo worthy places :)
Go if you are a fan of the drama,"It's just an empty big park far from Seoul. Nothing really capture my interest much but recommended if you are a big fan of the Korean drama ""Winter Sonata""."
The best of both worlds,"Nami island is well thought out, huge enough to make you feel ""alone"" in the outdoors, but not too big that you'd feel like you can get lost. Trails are well defined, maps abound and there are plenty things to do and see on the island. Many restaurants and eateries on the island so you can have something even for the unprepared. I am amazed at how clean this place is. Nary any trash on the floor. Just all you want in a park. The lotus garden was blooming when we came. Just an otherworldly experience. I hear it is awesome in the winter when everything is covered in snow.Do not miss this place, it really is beautiful all year round."
"Nature, serenity, tranquillity, relax and enjoy","Nami island is all about getting away from hustle and bustle of city life and enjoying nature in South Korea. It's located about 65kms east of Seoul, so a convenient day trip can be planned, especially for families with kids. Once you get there, you take a ferry to Nami island. It costs 8000 won for foreigners to take the ferry. You can spend about 1.5-2 hours exploring the island. It's very serene and beautiful and you appreciate nature if you live a city life. There are lot of coffee shops inside the island and few restaurants (mostly Korean food though). There are few activities for the kids as well. For example, there's a play area for the kids and a sky ride. You can also rent a bike and drive around the island. You can't swim on the shore, in case you're wondering. Overall, it's a good one day trip away from city and to enjoy nature. "
My Family Seoul-Jeju Winter Dec 2012,"We went Nami Island with our 12 months daughter (that time) and in a group tour. We didn't manage to looking around until the end since our daughter was cold and stayed at the information center near the entrance with a heater. There was a room provided for infant/kids with changing diapers and heater. I went alone walking and took pictures of the beautiful trees, squarrel (so cute),restaurants and so on."
Nice Island,"Not really big forest but they have some beautifull trees, resorts, cafe inside the island... it costs 8.000 for the ferry to get the island and 6.000 for transport hoop on hoop off to get the harbor, the shelter of the bus is behind of Cheongpyeong station, so get the left exit the station. They also have tourist information behind the shelter...you can also get Garden Morning Calm and Petite french before get the ferry harbour"
Beautiful,"Very beautiful island, especially during Cherry Blossom Season. The boat trip over is quick and easy, with the port just a short taxi or bus from the train station. Only downside is that the island is incredibly busy, even going on a random weekend in April."
Wrong season,"We visited at the wrong time, as the autumn were over but there wasn't any snow yet. So we got bare land with the feaking cold temp. Because it was an island the wind made it worst. We have to stop every couple minutes to warmed our body in front of fire or went to the restroom. Fortunately they provide bonfire every 100m. The meals too was delicious but I forget the restaurant. The serving amount was amazing even though we get serving for two we couldn't finish it, I think it could be served for four persons. Anyway really recomend for couple trip. "
This place is people who love K-Drama,"This place has a historic place in the Korea because K-drama like Winter Sonata take a place shooting a drama. A romantic site, must visit for foreigner tourist. You can take so many picture in here. So many tourist in here, amazing!!! if you hungry, Don't worry because there's so many restaurant in here from Europe food until Asia food. You can choose it."
very nice and cool place to stroll,"Going to Nami island, we did not take any day tour trip because we like to experience going there by ourselves and you are not oblige to follow the hour limit since you can manage your own time. We opt to get the the train because we bought Mpass unlimited ride for 3 days. From Myeondong Sta ( Line 4) to Dongdaenum History & Culture park station change to Line 2 towards Sindang Station to get to Wangsimi Station change to Jungang Line ( don't be confused find the sky blue line train - just follow the sky blue line sign in the corridor) towards Cheong-nyangi to get to Mangu Station change to Kyeongchunline towards Galmae to get to Gapyeong station. Go down at Gapyeong station and at the front near taxi station wait for the bus where you can buy hop and hop ticket going to Nami - Petite France - Garden of the Morning Calm at your choice which one you will visit first just follow the bus schedule. Bus will drop you at Nami port where you can buy the entrance ticket/visa at SKW10,000 round trip fare and entrance to Nami. If you want go can cross by zip line but it's expensive. At Nami you can have a cool walk and feel the breeze of the air. There are restaurants available but we only took pictures, roam around and then get back to the port, ride back to the port , take a taxi for only SKW3,000 going back to Gapyeong Station and back to Seoul. If you will just stroll and it will only took you 1-1.5 hours around Nami island. I recommend this place if you want to unwind."
Famous island from K drama,"Small island with beautiful tall trees along walk paths.Since it became famous from K drama, the island has been expanded with more picturesque structures. It is not too large or too small to enjoy a peaceful and nice afternoon. Along with the ferry ride, it makes for a nice tourist attraction. However, when the island has a couple of ostriches, it is trying too hard."
Do not go to the island for aquatic sports,"When arriving to Nami island you see a lot of water sports and you have 2 zip line options, one takes you to Nami island (just a few water sports and a swimming pool, other than that it's just artificially made natural park and squirrels) and the other takes you to the river bank (this is where the cool stuff is).. Nami island is nothing special, people just come here for the zip line..Tl;drRiver bank zip line -> water sportsNami island -> stroll through ""nature"" "
Picture perfect,"This is the 2nd stop of my private car hire day trip. It took around 30 to 40 min from Garden of morning calm to Nami island wharf area. I reached here around 11.10am. The driver recommended that we should have our lunch here as the food was better than at nami island itself. Indeed, price of BBQ pork and chicken were reasonable and food were tasty. We took ferry to Nami island around 12pm. The ferry is crowded but totally bearable. Ferry ride is just 5min. Nami island is very beautiful and almost every photo taken is perfect. We spent around 3.5hr here as we have booked gangchon railbike in the evening.It would be fun to rent a bike for cycling on the island though i didnt try due to limited time available.Though it is hot summer, the tall trees provide much shelter. Friends recommended me to try kimchi rice lunchbox at the island. It was indeed very yummy. Overall, this is a scenic place for nice photo shots. "
Island of Winter Sonata,"A breezy cool island with wonderful landscape....a sight not to miss. Picture perfect scenery. Well maintained and with all facilities. A romantic site, must visit for tourist. Stroll either in the park or by the riverside. Enchanting. Thumbs up....."
WOW!,"I took the flying fox zip-liner down to Nami Island, it was so exciting. Nami island is a must must visit place. On the way back from Nami Island via ferry was so so so packed."
Fantastic place,"There were a lot of people on the ferry over as well as a lot of people at the entrance when arrived on the island so I was pleasantly surprised that soon as I enter the tree lined paths, it's peaceful and quiet almost immediately. A fantastic place to chill out and simply enjoy nature or a great book. "
Simply Beautiful!!,"This place made more famous by that tearjerker Winter Sonata is truly a gem. It would be truly sad if you've not included this in your itinerary. We almost did miss this to be honest! The lush greens of summer was really stunning and a feast to the eyes. Next time, we will go here on a winter!"
Commercial Romance,Beautiful island but too crowded with tourists everywhere. Can try arriving at the island by ferry or 'flying fox' style. Good activities planned throughout the year. Good to visit at any time of the year. Only one hotel here. Many visitors are day visitors. I wonder if it will be better staying overnight n visit the places without the day visitors? Good restaurants. Can move around on bicycles n buggies. 
A lovely place to get close to the trees,"The Nami island is a man made forest like garden located on a little island on the river. There are restaurants, cafe, shops, as well as a few other places for photos. I believe there is a hotel on it but based on my experience, I would not stay overnight there. I went there in summer so there's no yellow brown leaves, still the trees planted there looks quite nice. I suggest a one day trip there would be adequate."
"Beautiful, but not enough time","Nami island itself was beautiful. Everywhere we looked there were rows and rows of trees. Although it was quite sunny, the trees provided shade in most places on the island. We took the shuttle bus from Namdaemun to Nami island, which is quite difficult to book for foreigners because I believe you have to download a program onto specifically a pc computer. Eventually we asked our hotel concierge to call the company and book it for us, but then you have to go to the office in Insadong (very difficult to find) to actually get the tickets. I would definitely recommend not going to Nami island on the weekend if you are taking the shuttle bus and want to zip line. It took about 1 hour and 30 min to get to Nami island. By the time we arrived at 11 am, the line for the zip line was quite long. The earliest time we could zip onto the island was 1:30 pm. But, the main reason I wanted to go to Nami island was for the zip line, so we did it anyways. By the time we arrived on Nami island it was around 2 pm, but we were told to take the 3:30 ferry back, so we could make it to the shuttle bus on time that leaves at 4. We were able to go through the main parts of the island in about an hour, but it was pretty rushed. We couldn't leisurely stroll throughout the island because the time crunch was kind of stressful. I wish we could have walked around the edges of the island and take pictures by the water because it was so beautiful. By the way the shuttle bus takes around 2 and a half hours to 3 hours on the way back on a Sunday due to rush hour. I'm only saying this because we made a friend wait for an hour or so in the subway... so this is just in case anyone wanted to plan for something after Nami island."
Beautiful island,"Nami island is the famous island in South korea..if you go to Seoul,don't miss to go here...You could go by ITX and bus,but to minimize my time,i chose Nami island package with Petite France and Gangchon railbike via Funtastic Korea...and i didn't regret it,cause Nami island is really far..and from there to Petite France and Railbike is far too.You must go by ferry to enter this small island.I like this island,cause it has beautiful sceneries...so relaxing..and you could take many pictures here"
Great Place to bond w/ siblings! ;-),"Went here with my bro & sis... We enjoy every bit of our stroll here, the ferry ride is good if your outside to really capture the view & feel the breeze... Lots of tourist as early as 9am on a weekday. Too bad we only spend an hour here, wasted time on traffic due to street protest. Be sure to allot 3-4hrs here to explore & really see what Nami has to offer. Crowded but who cares? Everyone is busy taking pictures so join the fun! Enjoy nami! ;-)"
it is really something!,"had a wonderful time touring the island on a sunny afternoon. wished i had more time, hope to visit in another season!"
Postcard Worthy,"Great all season round, Nami Island offers different feels to the tourists. Never forget to visit this place when visiting South Korea. You can come here via public transport, or the easiest is to book a tour/private transport (like what we did), and we just explored the place by ourselves. A very picturesque island, worthy to take snaps at every angle! There are a few shops that offer food, but might as well bring your packed snack and enjoy it there with the view!"
Summer Time in Nami Island,"I heard from a lot of people that the best season to go in Nami Island is during autumn. I think thats right, i am also longing for a day wherein i could visit Korea during autumn. But, i think, Summer time in Korea is also rewarding. My Friend and I visited Nami last june 2017, summer time in Korea. If you are going to tour around korea in just ""DIY"" , i suggest you should get up early and start your adventure at an early hour. This is a big mistake for us since we started going to Nami at 9 am. HAHA. its really a very long travel with a lot of subway transfers! We arrived at the station at 12 pm, then ride a touring bus going first to Garden of the morning calm. The bus has a scheduled date of departure and arrival and you should take note of this if you do not want to get left behind and wait for another hour for the next bus!anyway, Nami Island is beautiful even it is summer time. We arrived in this island at 5 30 pm and the sun is still up. There's a lot of beautiful sceneries perfect for your instagram feeds. haha! I also saw restaurants if you feel hungry, etc.Must visit place!"
Nice Scenery no doubt but getting more Commercialized,"Was in Seoul with my family this June and we decided to take a trip from my Hotel (around Seoul station area) to Nami Island. This was our second time going to Nami Island; the first time my family had been there was during an Autumn almost 8 years ago. Scenery wise, I personally feel that Nami Island is definitely more beautiful during Autumn than Summer. I am not sure why but this most recent visit gave me the feel the supposingly beautiful nature is now getting more and more commercialised than it was before. Maybe I had missed it during my last visit 8 years ago, but I cannot remember seeing so many new building structures on the island before that seem now built to milk tourist money. They now even have a new swimming pool and also a new (have to admit it is rather cool) Zipline that would take just 2 mins to zip into the island from the tower beside the Mainland harbour! I shall also share a bit on how my family get to Nami Island from Seoul Station. From Seoul Station, take Dark Blue line 1 to Yongsan Station. At Yongsan station, (transfer to ITX station) buy ITX ticket that starts from Yongsan station to Gapyeong station. (If i remember correctly, one train service leaves Yongsan towards Gapyeong at every one hour intervals) When one reaches Gapyeong Station, one can choose to take a shuttle bus at the 'one and only' bus stop beside Tourist Information Counter or take Taxi to the Nami Island Harbour which is about 5 mins drive away. My family of four took a taxi and it costed us about 4,000won/per trip. Duration of whole journey expected about1.5 hours from Seoul station to Nami Island Harbour. Hope it helps."
For nature lovers!,"Not only this island is good for Kdrama fans, but also for nature lovers. Trees everywhere! It's windy and really a good place to relax. We were there in summer. A lot of families were having picnics when we visited. We had a DIY tour to Nami and we went there via subway/train/bus which was a fun experience! "
Winter,Went here around 5pm and its super cold i think the weather was -10 thats why we did not see all the tourist spots but its super beautiful like in the korean dramas!!! Will definitely go back hopefully in other season spring or fall 
For Korean drama fans only,"While Nami Island is a nice place, it is unremarkable unless you are a die-hard fan of Korean dramas. This is the place where famous scenes of ""Winter Sonata"" were filmed which was a major hit in Asia in the 2000s. There are a lot of things to see in the island, but a lot of it feels like an eclectic mix of faux art or planned natural features. We went during the summer and along the river were many boats zipping by. The island is big enough to handle the crowds that come, but it doesn't feel like the nice and quiet place that the Nami Island ad photos seem to suggest. "
winter sonata,i love this place. this is winter sonata filming location. i'm coming when winter and it's soooo cool. i'm freezing
Lovely trip in Autumn,"As a big fan of Korean Drama, we planned the trip Nami Island weeks before our arrival in Korea. The weather was perfect upon our arrival, end of October, around 8-10 degrees Celsius. The whole island was covered in all different shades of yellow. We rent a bike and ride around the island."
Beautiful Island,It is a beautiful island but we cant venture to far as it was raining on the day when we visited it and we have 6 young children with us. There are a lot of tourists there. hence u can forget about taking good pictures without anyone present. 
Nice view!,"It was a great place to visit when u in Korea, nothing much up there but if u never been here it means u never been to Korea! Its walking distance to cable car from train station! "
Relaxing,"We went here during spring and there are lots of pine trees. It's a good place to relax and enjoy nature. Also, if you're a fan of Winter Sonata, you'd really appreciate this place. There are also cafes and shops in the island. Take lots of scenic photos."
The Colors of Autumn 🍁,"Nami Island is a must visit regardless of the season. Food in the island are quite expensive and just average. This place is famous for tourist because of the Korean Drama Winter Sonata. I really love the color of the leaves and the fresh air. Hence, I would definitely want to visit again. ❤"
Picturesque,"Nami is a charming island, popular with tourists. I am no fan of Korean drama but I still find the island appealing. There are plenty of interesting things in the island beside the beautiful tree lanes and greeneries: children playground, picture book library, waterfall, fountains, cafes and shops. It would make a perfect picnic spot."
Just for k drama location?,"The time we went was just the start of spring so there were few good sights. It was dry so if ever you plan to visit, make sure about the season you want to go. If it is spring and you want to see flowers everywhere, do not go the first week of April. They were just starting to plant flowers. If you have a friend whom you can ask, better do it to catch better sights. Well, the time we went was just okay and we still had fun. We just made our visit more exciting just like taking videos of squirrels and spot some birds. Well, the metasequoia path is crowded taking ala winter sonata picture. Not bad. Next time, I will try autumn to catch another beauty of Nami."
Refreshing ,"You are one with nature , the trees are so beautiful to behold , tall trees and trees with leaves of varied colors . It was just a surprise that I got advice of being very warm at this time of the year ,however temp this early morning is at 17 degrees and even the tour guide said it was going to be very hot hot hot . i guess when your from the Philippines hot / warm means a sweltering 36-40 degrees... great for leisure walk amongst the trees ... everything is green... beautiful ..."
Lovely place to visit during autumn,One of must visit place for Korea trip is Nami island. We went there end of Oct. The weather is not so cold and nice. This place gets very crowded during weekend and you will face jams going to and back of Nami island. You can spend 2 to 3 hours walking around the island. The scenery is very nice during autumn and you can take a lot nice pictures. Experiences yourself it is worth visiting this place.
Lovely visit in cool weather,"I think the best time to visit is when it's cooler. Can't imagine visiting in sweltering heat. Be sure not to visit during a Korean public holiday because the place gets very crowded and you will experience massive jams going to and leaving this place. The island is actually quite small, you can walk round the whole island is 30-60 minutes. People come here to take pictures. There are plenty of food and things for children to do. You can also rent bikes to ride around the island. I loved the natural setting and the pretty flora."
very romantic spot especially for k-drama lover,found what we saw in winter sonata k-drama. they even built the character statue. good atmosphere. will come again
very romantic area especially for k-drama lovers,"came here on winter, very cold, snowing, just like describe at k-drama winter sonata. well spent time here. some chocolate drink stall available, cross the river by ship. but make sure you dont left the last ship if you spend time whole day.lots of tourist but convenient yet"
Good but not THAT good ,"I am a nature lover who is not into Korean movies and have never watched Winter Sonata. Perhaps it is because everyone tells me how great Nami Island is. Perhaps I have been to places like Denali National Park, Shiretoko.....which is way way beautiful in terms of sunsets, and natural beauty. Perhaps, this visit is just one of those days (and it is a Monday) where the island is so crowded. Perhaps I am just not romantic. Perhaps it is just a very hot day.....Honestly, the Nami is lovely but it didn't match up to all the wonderful things I hear about the island. It's seriously way too commercialized for my liking. There are lovely spots on this island.....but the ostrich farm, and that Merlion (Singapore's icon) sprouting water.......is way over the top. It spoils the nature of this island that has so much to offer. The distance is quite long to traverse for what I just saw today......too touristy..... "
Photo-taking,"It's a bit hard to get there. Have to take the ITX to get there, then pay for a ferry (tourist has discounts). Be reminded that you have to pay for ITX and its different from KTX because tourists wouldn't know. More for photo-taking than other things. Crowded so hard to get a pretty shot without photo bombs. I also took the wrong train on the way back because I didn't know the train approaching was a KTX non-express one."
Romantic place,"Winter Sonata setting! The island offers additional entertainments like song museum, mini zoo, parks and picnic grounds. Full of huge trees and lovely arts every season"
best place for all ages,"just a small island but offers many things to do that you need a whole day for you to enjoy. I must say Spring is the most recommended season to visit this place, aside from the green color of the trees this is one of the place where you can see the cherry blossom. If you get hungry try to dine in in Namoon restaurant their seefood pancake is the best!"
A worth to visit and romantic place especially for lovers,"At first this was not included in our itinerary but as I see in many Korea`s tour this Nami Island was never been missed. I booked a tour in Funtastic Korea and precisely fantastic. We spent 3 hours to explore the Island but that was not enough. The serenity of the place was really I love most, the beauty of the trees, the island, the flowers and of course the big portrait of Winter Sonata cast Bae Yong Yoon and Choi Ji Woo. I was not fan of that Korean Drama but after I visited this place I started to watch that drama. Truly amazing and romatic place. There`s a lot of coffee shops restaurant and souvenir shops."
Island experience,"An island full of things to do like scenery, eating and light shopping.. it offers 4 different atmospheres -- summer winter spring and autumn.. would love to come for the other 3 seasons ..."
Romantic island ,"This island is beautiful at the snowing time, lots of big trees, warm open fire available in many places, early winter is one of a good time in this place, delicious hotdogs must try, the night view is charming. A lot of good spot to take pictures, if you lucky can see the local animals like rabbits and squirrels. Love to be back in different season too!"
No flowers..,"We came in the middle of cherry blossoms season expecting to see these popular flowers in abundance on the island. But sadly, they were so sparse. It's better, picture-wise, to go there in autumn where the leaves are golden. But the island itself is nice. The line of trees going to the middle part was still breathtaking. "
Nam Island Beautiful and Peaceful!,Wonderful time at Nami Island.Took the Shuttle bus from Myeongdong. Journey was approx. 1.5Hrs and was comfortable.Spend the entire day Cycling around the island. Very scenic and peaceful!
Peaceful and beautiful island!,Nami Island is a very peaceful and beautiful island. The island is famous for being the filming site of the Korean drama Winter Sonata. The island has many lanes of trees such as pine trees and maple trees which make for beautiful photo spots. I went there in spring and the place was very beautiful and tranquil. A great place to take a break from the hustle and bustle of the city. You can also rent a bike to cycle around the island. There are 2 ways to get to the island - zipline or ferry. My friend and I wanted to zipline in but it was fully booked! So be sure to book in advance if you want the zipline option!
Beautiful any season,"Lots of tourists and locals go to Nami Island because of the nice nature scenes and activities that one can do while visiting. It was a nice spring day so lots of trees have fully bloomed and the temperature was cool enough to walk around.Restaurants are available but on a nice day, it's nice to go on a picnic. Visit the lanes of trees and spots made famous by the drama Winter Sonata.Other pictures in Nami taken during autumn and winter are also just as nice so no matter what season one catches, Nami is a beautiful island to visit."
A great place for couple,"You can walk and take a lot of beautiful shot here especially in winter or cherry blossom season. There are fine restaurant and you should try. I love a library on this island, well-decorated and great books for children. There are some beautiful souvenir shop for you to get lovely stuff."
Very interesting place. ,The only regret I have after coming here was not zip-lining from the parking lot to the Island. It was a harsh winter in February 2016 when I visited but the place is extremely picturesque with the snow covered pathways and bamboo trees along with the frozen lakes. There is also a restaurant that serves halal asian food which was good. Watching people enjoying the snow and music was fun too. They also have some pets scattered around. 
Take time to enjoy Nami Island,"Most reviews and tours seemed to recommend 2-4 hours on the island. By the time we left the island, there were still people disembarking and in groups. What do they hope to see and experience in the last 1-2 hours on the island before sunset, I wondered?We went on a Sunday and, as expected, there were a lot of locals and tourists. Getting there was relatively easy. We chose to use the metro which connects to the ITX Gyeongchun line at Sangbong - on the same cheaper metro fare. If you choose this method and choose to travel on a weekend, be warned - the train gets crowded by mid-morning as many locals are donned in hiking gear for their day outing to nature. We had to stand all the way (45 minutes) from Sangbong to Gapyeong. Once you arrived at Gapyeong, there are 4 ways to get to the port - 1) walk the entire approx 2 km and perhaps get lost along the way, 2) taxi, 3) tourist bus if you intend to go to other tourist spots or 4) local bus which cost 1300 won - there is a bus approx every half hour. If in doubt, check with the tourist info center just outside the train station by the tourist bus stop. The local bus stop is on the opposite side and it's bus # 33-5. We used method 4 as we intended to spend the entire day on Nami Island.Most people go there, stroll, enjoy the nature esp the trees, look for the ""Winter Sonata"" photo spots and miss out on some of the other attractions on the island. The center of activities is in the middle of the island. When we went, the trees were ablaze with cherry blossoms. Some notable attractions1) Liuseum - a museum showcasing the world musical instruments collection donated by Liu Hong Jun2) the Song Musem in the same building3) the guest performances in the middle of the island4) the quaint shops5) enjoy a nice sit down lunch - we went to Nammoon restaurant - the queue was long6) Yu Qing Cheng sculpture gallery whose clay sculptures can be seen when you disembark7) UNICEF Hall8) and when we went, there was an outdoor ""Animalerias"" exhibition by Carlos Palleiro of Mexico.Take some time to enjoy instead of rushing thru in 2 hours."
Romantic Little Island - Endless Love Island,"This island becomes very popular amongst tourist because of the Endless love korean drama. It was so famous until all tourists who come to Korea always have this island in their list. But, this little island is so pretty and so romantic. The trees are really tall.. i went there during cherry blossom season, all you can see are flowers and nature. "
Serene stroll,"Nice to visit early morning as place can be crowded by tourist as it gets late. Direction & Cost (Fastest and stress free way):1. Take ITX train from Seoul Station to Gapyeong Station. Travel time is 45 minutes. Cost: around 10,700 korean won for a round trip. I advise to make your reservation at least the night before on their website then claim the ticket on the station. I also advise that you take the 7:00 am trip, and I will tell you that waking up early will be worth it. Train leaves on time, so make sure you are already seated on your assigned seat at 6:59 am.Tip: train car number is written on the stepping platform. Look for the ITX sign and your number.2. Their are two ways to get to the Port from Gapyeong Station.First is by Bus, there is a bus going rounds on all the tourist spot on the area. But it has a timetable when it will arrive on a specific bus stop. Sometimes it takes at least 30-45 minutes of waiting. See attached pictures for reference. Cost: 5,000 to 6,000 korean won for a 1 day tourist pass (unlimited bus ride to any tourist spot on the area).Second is by Taxi, if you don't want to wait in line and for the bus, I advise you to take the taxi. Anyway, it is just a 5 -8 minutes ride going to the Port. We took the taxi, as we don't want to waste time waiting, then we just split the bill. Cost: 3,800 korean won. 3. Once you have arrived at the port, there are two ways to get to the island.First is by Zip Line, if you are looking for a thrill and adventure then try it. It is about 2 minutes zip line from the port to the Island. Cost: 38,000 korean won. Inclusive of the ferry transportation going back to the port from Namin Island.Second is by Ferry, we took the ferry going to the Island because of the weather. We didn't dare to take the zip line as the weather was so cold. It was 2 degrees that time. Cost: 8,000 korean won for a round trip.We arrived on the Island at 8:05 am. It was a relaxing and peaceful stroll because there are only a few of us roaming around. We were just 6-8 tourist that time. Remember that I said it will be worth waking up early? The feeling was, you have the island all by your self. No noise and No PHOTO BOMBERS. We took our time to get a nice photos on each spot. We explored the entire island for 3hrs.More tourist started to arrived at 10:30 am. By then we are almost finished with our stroll.We left the island around 11am and decided to have lunch at the port and to check Petite France since we still have time left.We went back to Seoul via ITX train. We took the 6:00 pm schedule from Gapyeong Station.Went here first week of March 2017 and we experienced the coldest weather here in the island during our 9 day trip. Weather was -7 at 10:00 am to 12nn, but it a was nice experience.We are already planning on going back to South Korea but on a different season. Then will definitely going back to Nami Island and try the zip line!Hope this helps you plan your travel, and enjoy!"
"Cute day trip, a bit far from Seoul","This place is a random assortment of cute displays, 100 year old trees and small cafes / restaurants. We took the MTR from Soeul to Nami and it was a bit far but we wanted to be able to come and go on our own schedule."
Nami soem,"Nami easy to go, from gapyeong st,go outsite there bus stop to nami island(infront of tourist information).from.nami port use boat arrived to nami.beautiful place,much about winter sonata drama"
Explore,Spring is in bloom looking at the cherry blossom trees in this island. Fresh air and relaxing view i can't get over with.
"Very easy, nice day trip","Transportation :I took the bus offered by Nami Island. I had a bit difficulty booking at the website and I email the customer services for help. Their prompt assistance help me reserve the seats and answer all my questions quickly.I boarded the bus at Tapgol Park Isadong. So easy to find the place and the bus.The bus took around 1.5 hour to get to Nami Island. Good to look around the city and the Han River, plus comfortable.My ticket already included the bus ride, the ferry fare and the entrance fee. No need to queue up again. Well, you can also take the zipline at the pier to go to the Island. ( of course, you have to pay on the site) I didn't try this time. But it looked fun though seeing other people doing that.The ferries is big and it didn't take long to queue up for the ferrry ride. Nice and short view.THe island is beautiful. Well, it is packed with tourists, but you can find quite place at the corners. The cafe near the Song Musemum is so beautiful. Maybe tourist prefer the place offered traditional food. But this cafe is definitely a gem. You can sit outdoor at the back and feel like it is another world. Indeed, Nami Island is not huge. It is for young people to walk around. But for elderly and travel with young children, better to take the tour to look around the island at the pier. THere is two type of tours, one that drive around the Island without stop. One with a few stops. I took the second one and it is good that we can take a few minutes to take walk and take photos. Of course it is a bit more expensive that the one without stop. THe staff is helpful.to take photos too.We went back to the pier after the tour and began our walking tour in the middle of the island. There is also another a little train too. I didn't try this time. i had the red bean bun, It is very simple but you can really taste the nice red bean paste inside. 1000Won only must try.THe traditional restaurant is packed with people. We try the outdoor one with spring onion cake (pizza) Well, I beg you can find similar things outside. But this one is really full of good ingredients. THe acon jelly is wonderful. Enjoy the meal outside wonderful.THe environment is absolutely wonderful.THen we go back to the same bus and go back to the Tapgol park to finish our day. Lastly, I tried the pine nut ice cream at shop at the pier next to bus parking lot. They said it is made from the pine nut from the Island. Anyway, it tasted good.Very easy relax. I pick this rather than those local tours that offered 3 destinations in a day for I don't want to rush a lot."
Don't bother,Went there on a Sunday by taxi (100000) and it takes bout 2 hours.Then you have to take the ferry (8000)At last you are on the island where there are nice plants and trees a few restaurants and that is all. A very average park with some attractions like any other park that does not require 4 hours in a car.Not recommended 
Nature & Scenery,This Island is around 1.5 hours away from Seoul. Its a beautiful Island especially if you are a fan of Korean TV Shows. A lot of beautiful spots to relax and take pictures. 
A serene island,"You can access the island by ferry, with a discount for foreigners (or if you're feeling adventurous, you can zipline across the water).On the island you can hire bikes, tandems, peddle buggies and electric tricycles, or you can get a speed boat around the island.I opted to just walk and there's plenty of scenery to enjoy, as well as some fountains and sculptures. The biggest surprise was a field of ostriches in the middle of the island. There's also usually some live music and plenty of picnic spots."
Very nice place,Good place to remember the film winter sonata hahahaI am fan of that film :pBut maybe more like the film if we go there on winter season :)
Interesting place,"We went on april.. It was quite a busy place with tourist.. A lot of trees in regular arrangement, interesting for taking picture or selfie.. But it will be more beautiful on fall.."
Nice getaway from the hustle and bustle of Seoul,"The train ride from Seoul isn't that long and it is easy to figure out what trains to catch using Korea's subway app. The ferry rides are quite frequent but the bus to the port is not so frequent so it's easiest just to catch a taxi; it's really inexpensive and taxi drivers are used to driving the tourists to the port. The island is really such a lovely place to visit after being in the city, very tranquil and beautiful; it was also fun to see the ostriches and sometimes a glimpse of some squirrels running around. The island is quite small so it's quite quick to walk around the whole circumference of it. There also bikes to rent if you're so inclined, and there's some shops and food places on the island too. This place is really great for families with younger children.Make sure to get to the island early if you're also wanting to include the trip to Petite France after on the same day as its easy to miss the buses that go around."
Beautiful place to visit,I highly recommend a visit here as it is really beautiful during a snowfall. Revel in the beauty of nature all around and make sure to snap a photo at the iconic Winter Sonata spot! Definitely a romantic place to be if you are visiting here with your special other. The restaurant serves really nice food too and there is a halal restaurant within the vicinity. Just make sure to wear appropriate footwear and clothing as according to the season you are visiting as it was really cold and slippery during my time of visit. 
Serene!,"Found out about this Nami Island in the Seoul tv series ""Winter Sonata"", one can understand why you can fall in love with the place and with the person you are with. The place is so serene and peaceful. Everything is picture perfect! A must visit for tourist."
A must visit,"Prior to travelling to South Korea, this is the place i'm most excited to visit because of all the beautiful pictures I saw from friends who have traveled here before. And truly, it is worth the time and effort travelling from Seoul to here. Our hotel is at Dongdaemun, so from there we rode the Line 1 train going to Cheongnyangni. From Cheongnyangni, we transferred to Kyungchun line going to Chuncheon bound and alighted at Gapyeong station. Dongdaemun and Gapyeong are 18 stations apart. So it took us about more than an hour in the train rides.Upon arriving in Gapyeong, it was raining and the wind is really freezing. We are on a tight schedule, so our plan was to visit Nami Island only and nothing else (other popular tourist attractions in the area are petite France, garden of the morning calm and more) so instead of getting a tour bus ticket pass that goes through all the tourist destinations in the area, we just took a taxi going to straight to Nami Island Ferry terminal. The taxi ride which is a short 5mins trip only costed us KRW2900.Upon arriving, we immediately bought tickets. KRW 8000 for foreigners and KRW 10000 for locals. You just need to present your passport to avail the discount. And then, aboard the ferry we go. The ferry had a few seats available so prepare to stand up. But no worries, you may choose to stand in the ferry decks and enjoy the view while taking pictures which is what we did though it was freezing cold.Upon arriving, I was amused to discover that the park was really big. I was a bit disappointed though because their are no leaves on the trees the place boasts because it is still considered winter though it was already the last week of March Nevertheless, I was still determined to have fun. We rented a bike so can explore the place at ease. We took a lot of pictures and visited every corner of the park. We don't want to miss a thing!By lunch, we ate at this Korean Restaurant at the park and the food was wonderful. It's a bit pricey but totally worth it because of the huge servings. Restaurants can get a little crowded by the way, so be sure to make a reservation prior to lunch time to avoid being queued in line.After that, we want back to exploring. There are various galleries, gardens, museums and cultural themed places to check out. Other activities that you can try are: Zipwire, UNICEF Train, Sky bike, Electronic car tour and Boat tour.Tip: Visit Nami during the bloom period of cherry blossoms. I heard it was truly magnificent."
Always a great place for good photos,"The place is famous for its set as a popular Korean drama and it is easy to see why when you arrive.If you are a photographer, then it is easy to appreciate the lighting and background this place provides.A lot of tourists though, so best to either time your visit or find pockets of space where you won't get too many people passing by as you take photos."
Discovery walks,Had a fantastic time here. We were just walking around the whole morning. The pathways were so beautiful. And i loved the love hall...the place felt so very peaceful and romantic
Overally worth visiting,"I visited this place in spring, but my Korean friends told me you'll do best if you come to see this place in fall when the trees are playing all colors and the island allegedly looks like from a fairytale. Also, the cafe in the middle of the island serves amazing coffee and fresh juice (especially reccomending the one with kale)!"
Romantic,"Second time to visit this place, first time Spring 2013 & autumn 2016.Need 10 minutes with ferry to reach this place. Nice place, beautiful place, full with love. So comfort to walk in Nami. A lot of food and there is Mosque on there."
Photo spot in small island,"Nami is an island that can be reach by ferry. From gapyeong metro station exit 1 find the shuttle bus.The shuttle bus run through ferry port to nami, petit france and some other tourist place. You can take the time table for the bus once you buy the shuttle bus ticket.For entrance, you have to buy ticket to enter the island. Take the ferry around 10 min.Nami is famous because one of their korean drama take film there. And also for the trees, snowman feature. The place brings romantic aura. Different season is also different scenery.Strolling around will take about 2 hours, enjoy the surrounding, take picture."
Very beautiful and healing Island!,Nami Island is the shooting location of ''Winter sonata''. One of my favorite drama^^ I visited there during winter. I enjoyed the white snow field and ice lake scenery. Not really crowded because I visited in the early morning^^ Recommend for couples~
Nami Island in Winter,"1st time to experience Nami Island during winter. It's not as good as autumn except for the snow. But the trees are bare, the ground is wet and slippery. Difficult to walk the long stretch because you have to be careful. But of course it's always a good place for photo opportunities because of the snow. And despite the cold weather, there are still loads of tourists and the ferry to and from was always full.I would say it was still fun but would prefer autumn if I were to go back."
Nature and recreation but crowded,Lovely island with great sceneries of nature. It also has a park were guests can rent recreational equipments and has a playground for small kids. The area tends to be crowded especially during peak seasons.
Go for the Zipline (adventurous) and relax in the nice environment. ,"Highly recommended to do the Zipline. Nice weather and wind down to Jaru island and then include boat ferry to Nami island. If you had alcohol, they will not allow you to take the Zipline. Prepare to take alot of pictures once at Nami. Very nice nature and background for photo taking. We went during cherry blossom time. Wish we had brought a mat to lay on the grass and rest. Beautiful scenery. We also rented bicycle for 2 hours to explore and ease on walking the island. Last ferry back to mainland is at 1800pm"
No better way to spend the day,"If you're a photographer, you'll be in heaven. If if you just like taking casual pictures, this is a great destination for the day, and it's inexpensive. A wonderful walk through beautiful gardens, so many things to do."
"Romantic, Beautiful","We gave ourselves a full day to enjoy the sights of this much touted place, and we were not disappointed.To get there, we went to Gapyeong train station, and took a 5-min local bus ride (bus number 33-5). There are a few ways to get to the ferry station from Gapyeong train station. Recommend to take local bus if you plan to spend a full day at Nami Island as it is much cheaper especially if you transit from the subway. If you plan to go to a few locations after Nami Island (including Garden of Morning Calm, Petite France), then take the Gapyeong city tour bus instead. You could obtain information on the various bus arrival times from the tourist information counter just outside the train station.At Nami Island, suggest to walk the Bungalow Row Riverside Path, Metasequoia Lane, White Birch Lane, Tulip Tree Lane, for nice scenic views and phototaking. There aren't as many cherry blossom trees as compared to Seokchon Lake or Yeouido Park in Seoul, but nevertheless, the beautiful row of cherry blossoms can be found along the Cherry Tree Lane and Cheollipo Magnolia Garden. Just take note that the lanes can be dusty at times especially when maintenance vehicles or the electric car tour buses drive past, so be careful.A full day trip is recommended (we spent about 5 1/2hours in total on island), for those of you who prefer a slow walk and take in the sights and sounds without feeling rushed, have lunch at one of their many food outlets and take many photos against the beautiful backdrop."
Getaway from the city,"Reaching nami using ITX and free bus to the ferry is easy and convenient. There's convenience store almost everywhere and food and restrooms too. In Nami alone, there's a lot of trees and activity. From riding bicycle to just finding some squirrels. It's really is a place to relax and unwind. As crowded as the main road, go with the bike to the other end of the island and you'll find serenity. It is a small island indeed but there is still place to spend the night and things to see. The atmosphere is slightly romantic thanks to the film made here but it is a place for kids too. It has a large outdoor playground and did i mentioned bicycle. But if you're not really a nature fan or a kdrama lover, i think you'll get bored around 5-10 minutes upon arrival. Adventure junkie can pay some amount of money to go to this island using zipline, there's a queue and timetable (like every 30 minutes) for the zip line and it took you around 2 minutes to zip above the water. It is faster than the ferry but not when there's a line. The ferry itself is pleasant and you can enjoy the view. In Nami island, like in Seoul too. There's 4 distinct seasons, you will have different sceneries and ambiance when visiting during different times. I was told winter is the best one. It would be very cold but the white snow made this place magical. "
So much to do,"You have the option to take a ferry or zip line to the island. I didn't know there was a zip line until it was to late. I would suggest the zip line if you're not afraid of heights, it looked like fun. There was so much to do here, we didn't have enough time to explore everything. They have an option to take a mini train if you don't want to walk too much. We decided to walk. The island is beautiful. They have lots of souvenir shops and restaurants. "
You have to go to this place,Visiting this place was a memorable experience. You reach the ferry station where you get on the ferry and in 10 or 20 mins you reach the island. The island itself is amazing. Walking around is just peaceful and nice. They have various attractions like the UNICEF building and pond.They have prayer room for muslims and a halal Asian restaurantGreat place
Disappointing ,"We went to Nami Island in the hopes of getting to see beautiful cherry blossoms neatly lined up in rows of tall trees but we were greeted with dried up trees with no signs of cherry blossoms. Although I must say that the trees look beautiful on their own even without the flowers, it would have been much better. We researched about it and all sources say that the blossoming period is on the first week of April. The concierge personnel in our hotel said that the cherry blossoms were late this year. So if you plan to go to Nami Island, make sure to ask a person who is actually knowledgeable to avoid wasting time as this island is far from the city. You can reach Nami Island by bus (tour) or subway. The subway route is quite easy, just know what stations to transfer to, and when to go down (Gapyeong station). Take a taxi from the Gapyeong station to the ferry station (5 mins away). The ferry ride to the island is just 5 mins. There also a zipline near the ferry station for the adventurous people. "
Popularize by Winter Sonnata,Nami island became popular because of the korea novela Winter Sonnata. Before its an isolated island with limited people coming and going. But now there are ferries every 30 mins coming back and forth from Gapyeong to Nami Island. It was developed as a tourist spot but theres not much to see. We paid extra to ride the golf cart to have a tour of the island but we were disappointed because the guide spoke korean all through out.
Romantic place,"You can see squirrels running around. A very romantic place to walk around & photo-taking at Nami island. However, from Seoul to the island is quite a long journey, taking trains followed by a ferry there."
Cool place!!,"It was chilly morning in March of 2016 when i invited a friend to visit Nami island. Its the famous island from the koreanovela Winter Sonata so i didnt miss the chance of taking a visit and it was worth it. Forgotten how much was the entrance fee for the boat. We reached the place and started roaming around the huge trees, lots of restaurants in the area, toilets are clean too, surroundings are neat, museums and other historic instruments are displayed in the area. Took a few hours to stay and just chill and enjoy the view!! "
Nice Romantic Place...,"Naminara Republic or Nami Island is well known for foreigners. Many Korean movies and series take place here. Very romantic to walk around Nami island, especially in winter. Worth your visit and happiness."
Simple yet wonderful,A small island great for strolling with love ones..a short ferry away.. great place for kids with many playground but i went during winter and all the playground is wet and muddy..be careful if you are here during winter..i keep watching people slipping and landing on their back..played snow here and photo session..i roughly spent around 2.5 hrs here..great place and its famous due to the winter sonata drama..
Boring! Not worth the trip,"It was a great disappointment! There were so many rave reviews of the place that I was convinced this is the place to visit when in Seoul. One have to spend a minimum of 1.5hrs on transport from Seoul to the island and this is provided one time all the connecting transport well ie mrt, itx train, shuttle bus and ferry and it's not cheap about 25000 won to and fro Seoul. Boy was I disappointed, the place is so touristy with tacky architectures eg Singapore Merlion etc. I went in the hope to see cherry blossom and there was none. There are some picture worthy places but overall I will not recommend this place unless you are a winter sonata die hard fan."
A romantic day ,The island was so beautiful and romantic I loved every part of it. I wish I can visit it again one day 
Definitely worth a day trip,"We loved Nami Island! It's quite a way away from central Seoul, but Gapyeong station is easy to get to by subway and then getting a cab to the wharf is straightforward. We got the zipline across the river to the island which was beautiful and exciting but set us back 38000W each.We spent around 3 hours walking around the island, which was picturesque and romantic. We visited at the end of March so the weather was clear but chilly; I can imagine the island is even more beautiful in autumn or late spring when the trees and grass have a little more colour to them. However it will presumably be pretty packed at these times of year, since we visited in the shoulder season and it was still busy!"
Family with young children,Recommended to come!! A must s its something u wont get to c in spore.Beautiful n charming Nami Island..Walk down the road with e cool weather n breeze..shiok! Kids love e place n enjoy placing e leftover snow..Will come again if hav e chance.
Not fantastic,Not worth to come all the way here. Go somewhere else. Transportation is an headache. No assistance. I won't come back again.
Winter Sonata,"It sound cliche but this is why people visit this Island. Even though Spring has not arrive, and the Sakura flower is not blooming yet ,this place is still beautiful. To get on the Island ,take a ferry ride and enjoy the cool breeze. And for old couples who can't walk great distance ,take a ride on a buggy ."
Beautiful place,"Although far distance from Seoul to here, but it's worth to visit and walking around. Good location for photography"
Not too much beautiful but Dalgabi is so perfect,"I came to Nami Island in autumn - the best beautiful season here but I feel it's so normal, not special as I imagined through all ads about Nami before. All things look like Seoul's parks with red leaves...and nothing. If you want to find a peaceful, silence place to enjoy yr weekend with your boyfriend( or girlfriend), you should choice Nami Island.But, the most thing I like here there're some big famous Dalgabi/ chicken restaurent oposite Nami's immigration gate checkin. Chicken dishes are so so much delicious, even more than Seoul's and cheap too. Recommend food: cheese chicken with cabage. So damn awesome!MUST EAT! "
A good place for a couple hours of walk!,"A good escape from metropolitan Seoul, Nami (pronounced as Nam-I) is a 5 minutes boat ride away from the ""main land"", thus an entrance fee is required for you to set foot on it. Visited the island a couple days back and it was probably neither too cold or warm enough (Autumn) to witness the glorious snow sceneries portrayed in Winter Sonata as the lakes are cold and plants are far from blooming. A walk around the island can be accomplished by foot, rented bicycle (single, two person or a family or four) depending on your mode. I chose foot and reached the end of the island within 3 hours having stopped by almost every thing I can look at.I will personally think Autumn will be most ideal to visit but no time is best time and I probably feel a little disappointed because there wasn't snow nor beautiful colour leaves for me to appreciate!Hope for a better visit when I return in summer!"
Winter Sonata,I went there with my friend during summer season. It is a must for those who had watched Winter Sonata drama and KDrama. Beautiful scenery I must say. Don't worry the entrance fee is slightly cheaper than their people. So grab a chance and visit the place. I am planning to go there again during winter season!
...must visit in South Korea.,"A beautiful forest for photography. The serene landscape , restaurants and basic facilities makes it a destination that cannot be missed. You need to bring along not only your best camera but an excellent photographer. The feeling and memories are so great that make you want to go back again the next day."
beautiful nami,"I've been to Nami twice, in early fall and in late winter. Still take my breath away. Walk around, feel the mood. it's muslim-friendly place, so its a plus. take a time to explore, you will not regret it."
I love the frozen river and big trees,I visited Nami island during winter and it still looked wonderful. A boat ride is needed to cross the river going to Nami. The river is frozen and when the boat steers you can actually hear the ice cracking. I love to hear it crack. The huge tall trees look astounding. I felt like I was a really small person and the world is really big as I am surrounded by thousands of these big trees. Thank God I was able to visit this must- see place in Seoul.
Certainly Worth the Trip!,The fact that this island being used for a few Korean drama shows was no coincidence as the island is really beautiful and peaceful (provided one visits in the early part of the day before the arrivals of waves and waves of flag-bearing groups of guided tours). One could easily wander around this island for an hour or two taking IG-grade selfies.
Beautiful,"Came here with a group of friends, day tripping from Seoul. It is very reachable by subway or train. After you get off the train station just take a taxi to the port. This place became a popular destination for tourist because it was a filming site for a drama. The statue of the lead characters are also on the island. Ideal for dates, as many couple come here for dates."
Good choice for a relaxing half-day or whole day getaway,"TIPS TO ENJOY THE ISLAND1. There are 2 ways in reaching the island: by zipline or by ferry. If you're a bit adventurous, search for the company ""Zip Wire"" before your trip.2. Watch Winter Sonata before visiting. This hit Korean drama will make your walk around the island more meaningful.3. If you’re a tourist, don’t forget to bring your passport for a discounted price.4. Go early. The island is a popular pilgrimage site for K-drama addicts and a convenient getaway for locals. It can get crowded by midday, especially on a weekend.5. Sometimes, the tree paths can get so crowded, you’ll probably have a hard time getting a clean photo of you. You'll need a good picture-taking strategy to avoid many people in your background.6. If your itinerary is full, you can tour the island in 2-3 hours. However, if you want to get the most out of your trip, you’ll have to stay longer.7. You can also opt to stay overnight in their villas and bungalows.8. This is a nice place to sit, read and write."
Lovely Place!,"This is a very nice place to spend and enjoy your day with your lived ones!Very photogenic and a must visit, if you are visiting South Korea.The landscape was beautiful (we went there during the last period of winter)One of the memorable Winter Sonata scene was shot here, and also some present day series as well!During Winter, this is a must visit, very beautiful!An important tip: make sure you come here early!"
Nice place to visit,"Located at the center of the lake, we go there through the boat/small ship.There are the trees which neatly arranged.The Sonata statue is here as mention in Korean's film ""Winter Sonata"".There are restauran and cafe also some special local food here.Goot times to visit is winter, spring and autumn season."
If only it was snowing..,Would have been a nice place to visit if there was snow.. went in March when everything was dry and sad.. we want to go back again when it's snowing because the trail would have been nice to walk on.. and the pictures would have turned out better. Besides the trail.. there wasn't much to do on the island either.
Very Touristy!,"My partner and I decided to do a day trip of Nami Island. We didnt book it through any travel agency but instead decided to use the elaborate public transport in Seoul to travel to Nami Island. Our commute was smooth and from the Gangnam it takes about 2 hours to get to Nami. To get to the island we decided to be more adventurous and use the zip line! the Zip Line is very high and the it reaches speeds upto 70mph. So not for the faint hearted! The Zip line costed us KRW 85,000 per head but was worth it! Once on Nami Island, you can be overwhelmed by number of tourists there. We found a map of the island in English and decided to head off to explore it keeping clear of crowded areas (mostly any place that sold food!). We hired a two seater bicyle for KRW 7,000 for 60 mins and used it to the full to go around the island and take pictures. Very rarely will you find a photo op which is not bombed by another person! The island has ostriches which were fun to see! Other than that another main attraction was a row of tall trees right from movie sets. Apart from that there was nothing great with the place. People usually combine visiting Nami Island with a visit to Petite France which we decided to skip."
Escape the town !,"Take the ferry to Nami island for only 10 minutes. There are so many thing to do in Nami island. First, take a walk through the island and enjoy the sculptures, trees, arts and animals. Then sit and sip some coffee in the cold weather. You can also watch the shows on the stage. I have been here in autumn and the leave colour changing was so beautiful. This time was winter and the trees were not as nice as they were. It's a good place for couples, family and friends. "
Froze in Winter,"Definitely worth the trip. They have a lot of tree lined paths, and this place is great for just walking around and sightseeing. "
Interesting serene island ,Our family visited in early December early winter with temperature about 2 Celsius. From the wharf the island looked serene and surrounded by water and green hills. Lesser tourists around this time. The trees have not much leaves and the grass was of golden hues. The small ponds and water fountain have frozen. The main gravel paths runs in the middle and also to the right and left ; lined with the tall iconic non-native trees seen commonly in tourism pictures. The island is like a nature park but mostly grassy land with few undergrowth and local tree. There were man-made attractions and galleries but we didn't indulged in them. To get away from the crowds take the side roads and do a longer leisure walk or ride a bike or electric vehicle. One can also picnic around the shaded grassy field. The main building has a halal restaurant and prayer room for muslims. Don't forget to visit the grave of general Nami. 
Overcrowded with tourists,"In the winter especially, Nami Island feels like it was purposely constructed for tourists, without actually having anything really interesting if not for that one legendary Korean drama that started it all. The sights, once you get away from the swarm of tourists in the main road and the Winter Sonata photo spots (it's really still a thing!), are actually lovely. But it's actually just a really big park, not exactly special in my experience. "
I love nature!,"Not only did we get to play with snow, the scenery was very nice. A 5-minute boat ride and you get to see a jaw-dropping landscape."
Beautiful in winter sun,Nami Island is a great destination. Visited there in February on a bright cold sunny day. Easy 90 minute trip from Seoul by public transport with taxi the last 5 minutes. The island is in a flooded portion of the river channel in the mountains North east of Seoul. The are beautiful tree lines paths across the island and along the shore. There are also many museums and art displays and many cafes and restaurants.
Beautiful but too crowded,"This scenery is beautiful but the massive crowd ,which we are part of, means it is nothing like the pictures you see on the posters and ads. You think you are going to get a pic of you on the lonely lane line by tall beautiful trees but it's just impossible, it's you and hundreds of people trying to do the same thing. This place is perhaps significant for fans of the Korean drama winter sonata which we are not but too polite to tell our tour guide to stop talking about it i.e. this is the spot where the characters first kissed, this the field where the female lead did something...I can't remember... So go there if you are a fan or you like great scenery and don't mind large crowds. Once is enough."
Private Tour,Great English speaking private tour guide cum safe driver. We are very happy and satisfied with Mr Smith Chong service. He is friendly and proactive tour guide. We will not feeling bore with him. 
Worth going during Winter season,"Nice ice sculptures were seen during the season, worth going! Accessible by taking taxi from Gapyeong station."
Beautiful place,Nami island is related to korea movie winter sonata. Beatiful place n many attraction in there. Many food like red bean bun very delicious only 1000 won.
Full of romantic couples,"Nice place, regretting because not knowing there is hotel there can stay and can play the water activities there, can cycling or take the train here, can picnic here and feel winter sonata here...hihi"
"Long Stroll, Relaxing, Nice View","I don't watch Korea drama nor am i a fan of k-pop.My journey to South Korea is not influenced by these media.However, i still love the colours, the mood, the feel of Nami Island. It's different, calming, suitable for long stroll and reflections. There is an artificial mini waterfall..and few other artificial stuffs meant for photo-taking. They are artificial but they are still nice.. The surrounding view is splendid especially over the water, not sure if its lake, river or sea. I saw wild squirrels fed by passer-by. There are short-distance train-ride, bicycle rental etc. Nothing much to do except for long walking/cycling, relaxing at coffeehouse or restaurant, taking pictures with the serene and beautiful surrounding. After this trip, we will be heading to the rail-bike rides. Hence, I don't mind a much relaxing activity at Nami Island before our much awaited adventure.There is a halal restaurant called Asian Cuisine with prayer rooms.Ferry can be over crowded that comes every 15 minutes. Not many seats. You will be standing around but it's just a short distance.It was 17 December, Saturday. Get easily get package of Nami + Rail Bike + Petite France from Funko or Trazy. They fetched us in a coach at our area at Dongdaemun History & Culture Park. Winter. Probably 4-0deg. Very cold. No queue at Zipline maybe due to the weather being tooo cold."
Relax and Beautiful Surrounding,"I don't watch Korea drama nor am i a fan of k-pop.My journey to South Korea is not influenced by these media.However, i still love the colours, the mood, the feel of Nami Island. It's different, calming, suitable for long stroll and reflections. There is an artificial mini waterfall..and few other artificial stuffs meant for photo-taking. They are artificial but they are still nice.. The surrounding view is splendid especially over the water, not sure if its lake, river or sea. I saw wild squirrels fed by passer-by. There are short-distance train-ride, bicycle rental etc. Nothing much to do except for long walking/cycling, relaxing at coffeehouse or restaurant, taking pictures with the serene and beautiful surrounding. After this trip, we will be heading to the rail-bike rides. Hence, I don't mind a much relaxing activity at Nami Island before our much awaited adventure.There is a halal restaurant called Asian Cuisine with prayer rooms.Ferry can be over crowded that comes every 15 minutes. Not many seats. You will be standing around but it's just a short distance.It was 17 December, Saturday. Get easily get package of Nami + Rail Bike + Petite France from Funko or Trazy.

Glad I went but once is enough,"Interesting place but doesn't offer much maybe because we went when river is still frozen. Mostly took pictures and nothing else. Train ride to get there is quite loooong and we had to change stations thrice. The last leg was quite burdensome as the train arrived after almost an hour wait. We went directly to the Tourist Information Center upon exiting the train station to ask how to get to the ferry wharf. It was closed with a sign ""lunchtime break."" GrrrrrrWe decided to do trial and error and took a cab since there was no bus in sight. It was a good choice. We only paid KRW3500 which is the estimated fare posted in the taxi stand; 1.5km distance, 10 min ride.Fairly fast in getting the ticket to Nami and wait for ferry was less than 20 min.Didn't do much in the island but we had a very good lunch at the Swing Cafe right beside the Musical Instruments Museum. It's one of the first buildings you will see upon getting to the island after the wharf. The cafe had really super good vegetarian lasagna. It had a little bit of curry in it hence its color was yellow, instead of the usual red sauce. The chopped up veggies were also crisp and fresh, and for KRW10,500, the huge serving was worth its price. Two of us shared my lasagna.Another delightful find was a stall right along the road at the entrance to the train station. There was a friendly old gentleman selling skewered chicken, and they were really good! The meat was succulent and tasted so fresh and naturally flavored. If there's one reaaon i can find to go back to Nami, i will add that old gentleman's skewered chicken as another convincing reason. "
It's a romantic place,"Nami island is closely related to Winter Sonata. To be honest, I never watched that series, so I have no expectation whatsoever other than to go sightseeing. But this place is beautiful. I went there during spring, though maybe it would be more beautiful to go on winter. But still, the view is great. It is like walking in a small village surrounded by trees in the forest. Definitely worth visiting."
Where do I begin with Nami?,"We went to Nami in December and it was freezing (no snow though..growl!) although weather app puts the weather as being minus 1 degrees! Like I was so frozen I decided to get some fluffy ear muffs for me poor ears..and we were freaking glad we didn't take the rail bike option because freezing winds + open rail bikes = death by Olaf.. Looking pass the cold weather, Nami really is beautiful, but crowded.. After 30mins of wild picture snapping, I gave up and decided to just enjoy the scenery. The island is really quite big, so make sure you wear comfy walking shoes and if like us, you are going in winter, make sure you go prepared for the cold, ear muffs are extra helpful since they are quite expensive on the island. Judging by the openness of the island aka lack of shelter, hats/caps, sun screen and umbrellas are a must in summer. Visit the Unicef center while you are there and adopt an Aiwoo doll and donate to Unicef in the process! you can decide to adopt a plain Aiwoo doll and decorate it yourself or do what I did and adopt a designer/celebrity design one instead! There are a number of eating places and make shift stalls that sell yummy foods, so no worries about the hunger part! And good news for all Muslim travellers - they have a Halal restaurant on the island! The food was pretty reasonably portioned and priced, my friend enjoyed it a lot! The gift shops here can be a lil expensive so you gotta know what you are getting! They have these postcards of the famous snowman in different costumes from different countries that I went crazy for cause they were so freaking adorable and you can't find them on the mainland..hah!Ok, so here's the thing.. Some people tell me Nami Island's kinda overrated and is really popular for being the filming location of 'Winter Sonata' so they say just visit for the snowmans placed around the island... Even if you are not a Winter Sonata fan like me, or even if you are, I'd say go to Nami. Once there, you will fall in love with it. There's a certain je ne sais quoi about the place that cannot be fully described in words.. Its a certain something that begs to be discovered in person."
As romantic as winter sonata,"Brrrr cold but very romantic atmosphere during winter. The stream grown with lotuses was frozen and covered in white snow. The pines were all brown with branches covered in snow as well. There's a slight sombre reflecting mood about the whole island. Nice walk along the Main Street of the island. At the opposite end of the street from where we alighted from the ferry, there are some cafes and restaurants to allow one to rest and chill. Oops not chill, to hide from the outside chill. There are burning logs corners that dotted the street for those who just want to warm their feet. "
Beautiful island but everything is very expensive!,"Went to Nami Island during winter, even though there was no snow but it was very cold. It's really beautiful with romantic scenery. Over crowded with tourist and have to wait in a long queue to take photo at a famous tourist attraction. The coffee and other foods are very expensive and really not worth it."
"Romantic place, beautiful view","From seoul station we go by train to gapyeong station (last destination) and continue by bus ""gapyoeong tour bus"" (i think great idea for people who the first time went to korea by bus tour coz u can get 3 place with this bus tour.. nami island, pettite frech and the garden of morning calm) the price 5000 krw for a person. after u arrived at nami u pay 8000 krw for ticket entrace and ferry .. and u continue by ferry to that island.. "
Never get bored of this beautiful Island,"I was here for my pre-wedding Photoshoot. For some reason, the crowd is not as much as the last time I was here so it is consider lucky. As usual, this place have very scenic places and is actually perfect for couples, family or groups.The Island itself is not very huge so a slow stroll to enjoy the scenery probably take about 2 hour or so."
Winter Wonder Island,"They said that the best time of the year to visit Nami Island is winter, and I'm glad we did that (though I wanna get back during the other seasons, too. haha)! The place is known for the setting of the famous K-drama Winter Sonata. The tall trees and the body of water that surrounds it make the place truly beautiful and loved by visitors. Cafes are located in the area, as well as mini museums souvenir shops. It is a child-friendly park, recognized by Unicef. Events are also held there sometimes (There was an Ice Sculpture Making course offered when we visited the place). Overall, the experience was great and I'd love to get back!Take the ITX from Seoul or Yongsan to Gapyeong Station. Tickets cost KRW4800/pax. At Gapyeong Station, you may opt to ride a taxi (KRW3000 plus meter) directly to Nami Island or take the City Tour Bus (KRW6000) which follows a route passing the tourist attractions in Gapyeong and that includes Nami Island. Purchase tickets, which they call Tourist Visa (KRW8000 including ferry from and to the Nami Island entrance) from the gate, which they call Immigration and head straight to the ferry. In about 10mins or less, you will reach Nami Island. If you wanna go via zipwire, separate tickets are also sold."
Scenic Island,This place is popular because of some Korean TV series. It has a lot of good-looking views specially if you are looking for a nice background for taking your photos.
Nice Place but... can't enjoy too long..,"The 3rd trip to Korea, It just the 1st time to go to Nami, We take a daily tour from Hotel, with a bus, we go to Nami Island.. first we arrive to the river port and take a ferry to go to Nami Island... Wow the place really cool and nice for walking and sightseeing.. if too many people it's not romantic and can't enjoy.. but if not too crowded it's beautiful for romance and taking a photos."
I like it,"Nami Island is a famous place in Korea because of Korean Drama named Winter Sonata.From Seoul, my friends and I used train (ITX ticket, it cost 4800 won) to Gapyeong Station and then we went to Nami Island by taxi (It was costed 4000 won at that time).The passport to enter Nami Island was costed 8000 won included ferry ticket(I didnt know why, but it was cheaper for international tourist than local tourist). The ferry trip was a short distance but you could saw beautiful landscape.We went there at winter. There were some bonfire stop to warm ourselves. And then we could also write a message in colorful paper and hung it. We spent about 2 hours and It was a nice walk because of the view. There were also a museum and some korean traditional attraction.It was a good place to enjoy nature and take some pictures:)"
I love it,"it was very nice place, a litle bit too many people but I love it. we were there this winter and it was serene (eventhou there wasnt any snow). you have to spend at least half a day to enjoy this place completely. taking a taxi from Gapyeong Station will only cost you around KRW 4000 so it will be so cheap especially if you come with your friends."
Serene Nami Island,"Nami Island is beautifully landscaped and serene. Stroll along the island gives one a great sense of peace. The ferry ride to the island gives a good view of the mountain range. One can also take the zip ride to the island but not recommended for the faint hearted. Ffrom the train station of Gapyeong, preferable to take taxi if 3 person or more, to the Nami ferry ticket office. With passport, one get a discount off the return ferry ticket. Another good place to visit on return from Nami Island is the Petite French cultural village up the hills; if anything just for photo taking. Otherwise, highlight would be day trip to Nami Island."
Beautiful place in Autumn,"You can easily enjoy a beautiful view in Nami Island by walking around the island.If you are a nature lover, I extremely recommend you to go to Nami you will see little cute squirrels welcoming you there.Also, you will see a beautiful Ginko road where the road will turn to yellow in autumn."
Nice island,"Nice island, i come here in evening until dark, first i think come here in the evening is not good because dark, but i little bit wrong maybe dark but very romantic lighting making the warm atmosphere "
Sensational beautiful island!,"I and my mom joined the group tour from Trazy website. The customer service replied and guided us for booking. They have private tour too but we wanted to experience the group type. I think I have basically can assess their service level in breaking down five categories to ensure myself and others to book from which guide next time. Well, after confirmation, I recoeved a clear guide to wait at the subway station exit. A huge group of us going to Nami Island, Petite France and Garden of the Morning Calm. Our tour guide for this big group is called John. He was a wonderful, dedicated and responsible tour guide to us. We were a bunch of people from all countries joining this group tour. He will always make sure all in and giving us time to do what we wanted. The beauty part was, they never pressure you to buy things unlike some tours that I had experienced before. They are professional and jovial people. Helpful and trying his best to make sure we are all good and happy.Nami Island, truly beautiful that surrounded by trees, mountains and huge lake. I believe you will feel differently when you go in other season and Winter was just as nice as others. A long walk if you do not opt for a ride. I opted ride with stops as my mom could not walk too much during this cold weather although it was a sunny day.Winter Sonata is the key. The little snowman, owls, art pieces, drawings from all artists of the world, souvenir shops, eatable places,music museum and cafes were all around the places. The walkway of the park was truly sooooooooo beautiful that we almost miss our boat back to the other side. Go for it and experience the different. Love this place!! Thanks to Trazy.com!!"
Nami Island,"We went to Nami Island,it is great place to visit. We spend around 2 hours, hope we could spend time longer there. For sure I will be back there again. "
"Great Island, Scenic Views","My wife spent about 3 hours on the Island. It's a great place to visit, even in the winter as we did. My wife, who is a fan of the Korean TV series ""Winter Sonata"" enjoyed the place as the show was shot there. There were lots of scenic places to take pictures and we had a great time there."
Very great place to commune with nature.,"I went to Nami Island for Summer (June) and early Winter (December). There are lots of people visiting the attraction during Summer. I wanted to take the zip line going to the island but waiting time is 4 hours because there are lots of people. Took the boat instead but it was worth it. Because it was summer eating Bingsu at the cafe was perfect. The greens all around are beautiful. You could also see some animals like ostriches, ducks, squirrels, and peacocks. It would be best to bring a small umbrella during this time. During winter, it is much less crowded. It is much easier to move around. When I went there last December there was not much snow. There were several ice sculptures to appreciate. There was even a slide made of ice. Taking memorable pictures is also much easier during this time as there won't be much people photo bombing your photos. It was very cold, it was -2 degrees when we went there. To get by with te cold, there are lots of fire woods burning located in startegic places for people to warm themselves.Visiting the island in both seasons is incomparable. Both are very beautiful."
Nice place to visit,"Visited Nami Island in Dec 2016 as part of a day tour.It was around an hour drive from Seoul.There were 2 ways you could get to the Island - by zipline or Ferry.The zipline was not for the faint hearted so we opted for the ferry.After buying your tickets at the Nami Island ""customs"" we proceeded to the ferry terminal. The ferry schedule was quite frequent, I think it was every 15mins.The ferry could accomodate probably a hundred people at a time and took less than 10 minutes to get to the island.Upon arrival, cafes and shops greeted you.The island was like one huge well manicured garden, with the famous tree-lined on both sides walking trail.There was also a small zoo with some animals, life sized figurines and there were fire-pits to warm up from the winter cold. You could also pose in front of the Winter Sonata poster.You could also take the mini train which circled the island.Overall if you like to visit parks and enjoy looking at scenary and nature, do visit Nami Island."
Lovely Small Island,"We went there in autumn, you can see very colorful scenery in the island. One of my perfect holiday..."
Pretty Island,Spend 3 Hours on the Island. Best to slowly stroll around the island and enjoy the scenery. The cleaners are so creative here! They arrange the fallen leaves into patterns or name of countries!
Beautiful Island,"Beautify island with tall trees. Went Xmas season but there is no snow. Tree are bare but still scenic. There are 3-4 street stalls (red bean bun, sausage etc) and some restaurants and coffee joint. Easy to go by yourself. Take Train to Baegyang-ri. Exit, there is a information centre right outside that sell group bus ticket to Nami. Petite France and somewhere else. I think its $6000w round trip, you can alight and re board the bus. Its a loop service. Didn't go on that as we only have time for Nami. Cross the road and take the public bus. Its a 5-10 minutes bus ride to Nami ferry. There is lots of taxi waiting at the train station as well. If you have 4 people, taking a taxi may be cheaper. The public bus stop at the ferry. Buy tickets $8000w per person for 2 way ferry. The ferry ride takes 10 minutes. We spend about 2 hours there. There are a lot of spicy chicken restaurants at the ferry terminal. Basically spicy chicken with cabbage DIY frying on a hot pan. $25000w for 2 person. There is a museum on the island, didn't have time to explore. A must go place. Small island but great photos."
Must visit,"A must visit place in Autumn.Beautiful scenery.You could ride a train, bike or just take a walk to enjoy the Island."
Too commercialized. Otherwise the island itself is a beauty.,"The island itself is full of history. Yet, it is far too commercialized. The rave is mostly related to Korean drama, Winter Sonata, which was broadcasted at least a decade ago. It is filled out restaurants. It is a tourist attraction but could see a lot of locals going there too for a day trip."
Winter wonderland,"Really worth visiting. Fantastic scenery, quiet and great tour of the island available. The wild ostrich area was impressive and stunning views of the lake surrounding the island. There were also food stalls which were great! On the downside, the Naminara bus from Insadong had an extremely unpleasant driver who told us to be at the bus by 3:15. However, upon arriving at the agree time, he changed his mind and told us he was cleaning till 3:40 and not only wouldn't let us on the bus but wouldn't let us wait on the bus instead telling us to sit in the cafe. Really didn't appreciate waiting in the freezing cold.. Did not see him ""cleaning"" whilst our entire group were waiting. On the contrary the driver to namdaemun was friendly and on time and he let us return on his bus. "
Average walk in the park,"This was a walk in the park, literally. Went in winter, it was snowing, but the combination of ticket prices, larger crowds and increasing tourism made the place less wonderful than it seemed. Worth going if you are a K-drama or Winter Sonata fan, only if."
Perfect place to escape from busy town =),"Suggest not to go on Sept. Season just change from Summer to Spring, temperature still hot and dry. It is good to go on mid of October. The leaf still in green. I believe this place should go on Oct onwards or Winter time. Indeed a perfect place to escape from busy town as Nami Island is a relaxing place where can calm your mind, you can spend a day if you love to take pictures. Suitable for all range no matter family, friends or couple. Easy to access by bus."
Say Cheese!,"A place for photos photos photos. Iconic area is the row of trees which was filmed in Winter Sonata. We got a package deal and getting to Nami Island is a breeze. Look out for agent deal, 1 day trip. Worth it."
Pleasure walking at Nami Island,"The Nami Island is bigger than I thought. Need to spend at least 2-3 hours there. Nice scenic park with nice decorative buildings along the way. Leisure walking, not to far away from the city. Lots of good restaurants there where you may relax and enjoy."
Romantic View ,As pictured on 'Winter Sonata'. No doubts about the scenery and view if this small island. Went there recently during winter and the place is flux with people capturing pictures. A must place to visit!
