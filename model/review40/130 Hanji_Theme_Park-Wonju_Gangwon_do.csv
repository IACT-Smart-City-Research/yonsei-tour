Interesting paper museum,There is an interesting paper making museum here which is worth a visit. It’s the famous Hanji paper. At the time there was a small class of children making some boxes in room and was fun to watch them. The museum is very interesting with lots of examples; there’s also a good cafe and shop where I bought a beautiful fan made with - Hanji paper. A lovely souvenir.

Korean Paper Museum/Gallery/Workshop,"I visited this place as part of a tour group during out 4-day Eastern Korea tour. It wasn’t really a theme park but more of a museum/gallery/workshop about hanji, the Korean type of paper made from the bark of the mulberry tree.We saw a demonstration on how hanji is made and we got to make a paper jewel box. There is an interesting museum about the history of hanji. There is also a gallery with some amazing displays made from hanji. A gift shop and a cafe are located in the lobby of the building."
