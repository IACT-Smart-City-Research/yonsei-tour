Small but pretty cafes around,"It was a bit cold to swim during our Sept visit but found beautiful turquoise water, beautiful breeze and lively neighbourhood with pretty cafes around. Our tour/driver highly recommended us to visit Woljeongri beach instead of other beaches and glad that we did. We found cafe on the right corner of lane on 1/F was with great view."
Chill Beach ,Beautiful small beach with lots of resteraunt and cafes around. Each cafe is so beautifully decorated with some having their own outdoor area for you to chill and enjoy the view. There are multiple area with allocated photo opportunities for those who likes to take pictures. Definitely a place to recommend coming in Jeju Island. 
Beautiful beach,Very beautiful beach with azure sea. Lots of coffee shops and restaurants on the shoreline to grab a snack and enjoy the view.
Beautiful beach Turquoise water,A beautiful beach with turquoise water on the north east coast of Jeju island. Lots of cafes overlooking the beach. popular in summer. The coastal road along this northwest portion of jeju is spectacular with many beautiful coves and places to stop. there are also a lot of windmills along the coast as well as the Korean Energy Research Institute
"Great view, a lot of cafes and restaurants.","The sea view is great. And also you can find a lot of hipster cafes and restaurants here. Plus, this is the spot where you can get a great Electric Power Generator Wind Turbine pictures."
Beautiful Beach,"You can see windmill and it was lovely to take a picture. There are shops nearby and convenient store. Relaxing, windy and nice white sand beach. "
"Beautiful, cozy. The most beautiful scene of Jeju Island","제주 북쪽 해안가에 위치한 이 조용한 해변은, 제주에서 최근 2~3년간 가장 핫한 해변 중 하나일 것이다.'달이 머물다가는 바다'라는 뜻의 지명과 같이, 월정리 해변은 제주에서 볼 수 있는 아름다운 해변을 잘 보여준다.바닷가만 예쁜 것이 아니고, 좁은해안도로를 따라 길게 펼쳐진 카페촌에서 당신은 제주가 선사하는 아늑함과 포근함을 느낄 수 있을 것이다.20대의 커플이나, 동성친구들 뿐 아니라, 혼자만의 사색이 필요할 때도 매우 추천하고 싶다다만, 어린이를 동반한 가족단위 여행객에게는 다소 실망감을 안겨줄 수도 있다.왜냐하면, 해변에 햇빛을 피할 수 있는 나무가 별로 없고 (대체로 강한 바람이 많은 편이다), 해변에 위락시설이 대부분 젊은 여성을 타겟으로 한 가게들이 많기 때문이다.접근성은 그다지 좋은편은 아니다. 101번 버스로 공항에서 non-stop으로 갈 수 있지만, 배차간격이 짧지 않다. 렌트카를 이용하면 쾌적하게 갈 수 있지만, 주차장이 협소한 점은 개선이 필요할 것 같다한국사람들이 사랑하는 해변 월정리로 오세요~Located on the northern coast of Jeju. This small village and beach is the hottest areas in Jeju in recent years.Woljeong-ri Beach is a beautiful place in Jeju, as it means the It is so beautiful that the moon is resting above'.Not only is the beach pretty, but at the cafes are along the narrow coastal road, in there you can feel the compotable and cozy.I would like to recommend not only lovers, but also solo tourist.However, it may be disappointing for family tourists accompanied by young children, because there are no trees on the beach to avoid the sunrays (cause heavy winds), and there are many stores on the beach that mostly for young tourister.Accessibility is not very good. No. 101 bus is available from the airport to there with no transit, but the interval of timetalbe is also not short. A rent-a car is a pleasant way to go, but I think it's necessary to improve the capacities of the parking lot.Welcome to Woljeong-ri, the beach of Korean favorite!"
Relaxing on a rooftop cafe,"Lovely autumn morning, clear blue skies, coolest breeze and morning sun, what else do you need for a perfect morning over hot coffee and some oven-fresh pastries?Absolutely nothing else but time to stand still. Plan a late lunch of grilled abalone after this for a prefect ending to a great day. "
Beautiful beach town,"This place has great vibes and energy of a beautiful beach town. Many cafes offer good views. I spent about 2 hours in one of the cafes and totally enjoyed the views. There’s a very good seafood ramen and pancake restaurant nearby : Sogob-E  소곱에 – Seafood Ramen ShopAddress: 565 Woljeong-ri, Gujwa-eup, Cheju, Jeju-do, South Korea"
Beautiful beach,"Beach is clean, water is sooooo clear with a nice colour. Sit on the beach, enjoy your coffee there. In front of the beach, is a coffee street. If you want to have a relax trip, can spend half day time there, just enjoy the breath of wind, enjoy your coffee and have a pcs of cake, read your book. Perfect! I prefer Cold weather of cause. "
Okay beach,The beach and the restaurants next to it were nice. It was a windy day so only surfers and I were swimming against the big waves. I don't think the beach itself was too impressive. Not for sunbathing atleast.
Architectural nightmare around ,"It must have been quite pretty here back in the days. But now this small beach is surrounded by ugly buildings, that totally do not match to Jeju Island character. Seems like no urban planning in place and land owners try to outdo one another in search of bigger and better. Shame"
Small pristine beach,Not much to see or do except to take a few moments to take it the view and wind of Jeju. Many people (mostly Koreans) are seen walking along the beach picking shells or dipping their feet in the water. Not much sunbathers on this beach. 
Visited for prewedding photos,"Amazing beachside for prewedding photos as there are this colorful chairs that are always available there as props. The beach was clean and there are cafes and the famous colorful candle gel gift shop. Great visit with family, couples or for photoshoots! "
Great view. Friendly people,"Great view and friendly people! A wonderful place to relax from the stressful working environment and find peace. It's very very very windy in May, do remember to bring along a hat or sth else to make sure your hair won't fly all around like mad~~~Very friendly people who are also patient despite language barrier."
"Fine sand, Clear water, VIEW",We stopped by Wolijeongri Beach for about 30 min. on the way to UDO; the water was very clear. There were kids playing sand on the beach. The view was peaceful. We enjoyed our short walk along the beach. You can get some snacks and a good coffee from a café or a convenient store nearby. There is a restroom facility too. 
Lovely place!,"We loved the atmosphere and ambience here.Very local and full of fabulous cafés, restaurants and bars.Pretty place.For the beach itself, it is nice, but average.Whatever you do, never stay at Aqua BEAutique hotel!!"
Very Windy and sleepy beachfront,"The day was dark, cloudy, windy with heavy drizzle. It gave a rustic feel to the little fishing village by the beach. There were two families there and a couple who were taking pre-wedding photos. If the above was a normal situation, then it would be a perfect gateway for writers and people who want to get away from the rat race. "
Small and windy beach,"The beach itself is quite small, however, viewing it from the windows of one coffee shops along the beach is a very nice feeling"
Beautiful water,"This beach is surrounded by cafes, seafood, and one amazing restaurant in particular - ""Arepa Grill!"" At the end of the main strip facing the water, this place offers the most amazing Venezuelan food and ice cold beer They have a delicious vegetarian arepa that they can make vegan upon request. It's a nice change from the cafes that are all quite similar. I did, however, enjoy the bean bags at ""Woodstock."" "
Interesting beach culture,"The beach has some of the finest sand I have ever seen, but beyond that it doesn’t attract me as it’s just an endless expense of sand. However we were told that this is a very famous beach especially for wedding photos. However what interest me are the cafes facing the beach. Most have decks open to the sky or constructed on the roof top, complete with deck chairs so one could order your favorite drink and enjoy the view at the same time. Interesting. "
Beautiful beach,Past by Wolijeongri beach on my way to other attractions. The beach is very beautiful. Good to spend 15 mins of your time there to take some nice shots. 
Beautiful beach,Beautify beach on the East Coast. There are few wooden chairs by the beach to take memorable pictures. 
Pretty blue beach ,"Clear waters, soft sand beach and you can find many people taking strolls and chilling by the beach. You can also visit the cafes along the beach which provides a nice view"
"Relaxing, windy, quiet beach","Love this beach, we went in winter, wind very strong and cold, most of them hide inside the mini bus but few of us walk around, taking photos, see the raw seaweed near the stone "
Amazing yet Quiet Beach,"We went there. picture perfect view, quiet and serene. We had a chance of spending time there on 1 July, 2017. perhaps one of the best beach in Jeju. Please go. you will enjoy."
Amazing beach,"Clear skies, great sun, not overly hot. Only bad thing is the parking but other then that spend about 2-3 hours here sipping jeju famous harubong tea is definately a luxury! "
Cool Beach,Recommended place for photo-taking with a group of friends. There are several cafes & restaurants along the beach. Nice place to chill out.
Love it,Had so much fun biking around Jeju and stopping by this lovely beach. I highly recommend going there for half a day.
Woljeongri Beach,"Amazing beach, arguably the best one in whole Jeju Island. Transparent kayaks are amazing never neen to one before. Is 20,000 KRW for 30 mins. A lot of coffee places around the beach too."
"many cafés, a busy street","There are many cafés, restaurants and convenience stores. Not my favourite beach but in general very nice and clean water. I recommend it if you come with children."
Adorable beach,"We decided to get off the bus on the way to Jeju city and walking towards the sea it looked like a really quiet place... When we arrived on the beach front we were pleasantly surprised by all the quaint little cafes that dotted the shoreline. There's a surf school on the beach and parasols everywhere. It is a smaller beach, but clear and shallow water. You are not short for choice for lunch or snacks. We had a lovely day!"
Adorable Little Beach Stop,"We happened upon this beach while driving around the island and loved the quaintness of it all! Great little cafes although finding an actual meal there was hard. Perfect place to play on a clean, sandy beach or to grab a dessert or coffee. Loved the bright colors and quaintness of it all!"
Pristine water,"The beach is pristine even it is quite far. However, I love the real atmosphere of Korean style here.You can take photos by sitting on the available chairs near the seashore."
Amazing California-vibed beach,"This beach is amazing. It is by far one of my favorites on Jeju. As soon as you arrive there is just a great atmosphere and a great vibe! The view is amazing. There are rocks to take pictures on, chairs set up for the perfect beach picture. The white sand and the blue sea water are beautiful. The water is clear and inviting! It also has great places to eat, a burger place, a taco place, and many cafes where you can get coffee, teas, ice creams, etc. It can get crowded, but should be expected for any beach in Jeju during beach season."
Nice view and there are many cafe around,There are many couples taking photo at the color chair. You may want to sit at the chair facing towards the sea and take a photo from the back. Such a nice and great sea view. There are also many cafe around where you can enjoy your drink and at the same time enjoy the wind and view there.
Beautiful beach :),"Woljeongri Beach is the best beach in Jeju and many people go here in Summer. Beautiful, calm, quiet and beautiful beach, and plenty of cafes nearby. Worth to visit!"
