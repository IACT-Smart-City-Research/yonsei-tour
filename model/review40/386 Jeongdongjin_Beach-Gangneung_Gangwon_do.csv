Clean sand & clear water,"Leaving the train station, straight ahead was the rail bikes. Super fun with minimal pedalling. Wished it was a little longer.Leaving the station to the left is the pristine beach with magnificent views of the Suncruise hotel. Hourglass park a little more farther.Good day trip."
Lovely beach! ,This is a clean and great beach. It also has lots of sea glass so we enjoyed an afternoon collecting lots of beautiful pieces. There is no shade however. There are lots of touristy things next to the beach like the time museum and the little peddle train but we chose to just walk. 
Rail Bikes,Foreigners can not ride nor register to purchase the rail bikes since they are only required Korean credit card. Global Korea???? A representative couldn't (did not) know what is going on.외국인은 레일바이크를 탈수가 없는걸 아시나요? ISP 프로그램은 한국 현지인에게만 할수 있는 프로그램입니다. 외국인은 할수가 없군요. 한국사람에게 현금을 주고 해야 할 지경 입니다.글로벌을 외치면서 너무나 아쉽습니다.
The train station is cool,"We checked out the beach through the railway, we checked out the station too. Fits couples and families with small kids."
in the middle of not really somewhere - but I didn't check before,in the middle of not really somewhere - but I didn't check before - hence - perfect for lovers.maybe more liveliness in peak season. 
Beautiful beach in a small town.,Beautiful aqua green ocean in a small town. I loved the smell and nice color of the ocean. Beach trail that starts from the parking lot on top of the Sun Cruise hotel was awesome.
Beautiful quiet beach,"We took an overnight train to the beach and as a result we saw the sun rising over the ocean. It is a very special experience. The beach is beautiful and easy to get to, but its a little rural and people don’t speak a lot of English. There is a good bus system that can be used to get around as well. "
Nice beach,"Cute little sea side town with quirky attractions, nice beach and lots of local restaurants but not a lot of English"
Great view and rail bike,"Beach was not that long but the scenery itself is very satisfactory, there is a rail bike you can ride - from the railway station nearby. it is around 40~50 minutes experience. good for family activity."
"Beautiful, quiet beach","This is the beach near the Sun Cruise Resort-- famous for that ship hotel on a cliff. In fact, you could take a scenic photo with that as backdrop.At the time we can when it was a super peak season in the country, this beach just had few people. The sand is light brown. It's a relaxing spot. Swimming is only allowed till 6pm although the sun set at 7:30pm."
Interesting beach where you can see a ship on top of the hill and rail tracks,Interesting beach where you can see a ship on top of the hill with rail tracks along the beach itself.
Sunrise. It depends on when you go. ,It is the one of the best place for sunrise. Its name named aftet the lattitude of Seoul and this Jeongdongjin. Jeongdongjin is located directly in the east of Seoul. :) 
"Fun activities, nice beach","The name Jeongdongjin comes from the fact that it's directly East of Seoul as the crow flies, and a lot of people go here to watch the first sunrise of the year on New Year Day. Jeongdongjin itself boasts a train station that's closer to the beach than any other (at least in Korea), and indeed the station is practically on the sand. You can take a real train here, heading south, or you can take a really fun tourist train where the ocean-facing side of the train is all windows. It's a fun, beautiful trip.Right next to the train station, you can ride a rail bike here, which is a peddle-powered four-seater that runs along railroad tracks. Don't worry if you're not fit; the bike as an electric battery that will power it if you want to just sit back and relax. It's a bit of a long ride, so set aside an hour or two and come early to get tickets.Aside from the trains, Jeongdongjin is a popular domestic tourism site because it was the filming site of the popular Korean soap opera Moraeshigae (meaning Sandglass) in 1994. There's a big sand-filled hourglass commemorating this. In August, there's also a film festival here.The beach is nice, and sometimes has a little tide pool. It's definitely not a ""hidden gem"" beach, but it's a nice sandy beach. You can rent ATVs on the sand in the summer, or just hang out and enjoy yourself. Not far from the beach you can check out Haslla Art World, which is a kind of outdoor museum on a hill. There's also a hotel in the shape of a big cruise ship overlooking the beach, which is kind of cool to walk around. Be warned that the prices of coffee and food in the cruise ship hotel are outrageous, but once you've paid to get in the front gates of the hotel there are nice views of the cliffs and the sea."
Popular place among the locals,Caught the new year sunrise at Jeongdongjin Beach! Probably the most unforgettable view I'd ever remember. It's a popular place among the locals and I'd say this place is very worth a visit. Lots of local stuff to explore here!
Beautiful beach and great food,"This is such a beautiful beach, probably one of the prettiest I have seen in Korea. The water was crystal clear blue and the sand was clean and white. I recommend avoiding going during ""swimming season"", as you will likely be unable to find enough space to spread out a towel. I went in May, and it was warm enough to swim, and we had plenty of beach all to ourselves."
Great for pictures!,"Due to the arrangement of my schedule, I did not take the direct night train from Seoul to Jeongdongjin station. Instead, I spent half a morning traveling from Seoul to Jeongdongjin. It was a hectic morning, making sure I don't miss the first trains to the bus station but it was worth while. I went in October and the weather was just nice, not too chilly or too hot. I managed to walk along the beach, enjoying the breeze, without feeling sweaty. Perfect pictures could be taken almost at every corner of Jeongdongjin. I understand a lot of local Koreans or even tourists will catch the night train and arrive at the Jeongdongjin station to catch the sunrise. Jeongdongjin is a popular place for viewing sunrise since it's is facing the East Sea. The night train will leave Seoul at about 1030pm and will arrive at Jeongdongjin at around 4.30am or so. There are a few cafes which open at about 5am for people to keep warm before the sun rises around 615am to 630am. Other than the famous Jeongdongjin train station, there are also time museum and rail bike around the area. I enjoyed the place a lot, it is a slower paced attraction, great for pictures and for relaxing."
Picture-perfect Beach,I gotta say that this is the most beautiful beach I have ever seen in Korea. The scenery was just picture-perfect and the pristine sand just feels so good on your feet. Near the beach is Jeongdongjin rail bike which I highly recommend visitors to experience to explore the entire beach area.
Nearby JD Rail Station (Tokyo) is interesting walk-thru with beach stopover,"Jeongdongjin coastal area is a popular summer getaway for locals and for the older generation of Japanese, referring to it as the East Sea as it brings them closer to the island of Japan. The well maintained Rail Station seemed semi-frozen in time despite modernization and the surrounding houses & buildings resembled close of Japan - it would've been nice to experience the sunrise but our travel plan did not allow for it - our bus ride from Seoul took almost 3 hours on a weekday morning traffic, with a restroom stop - as even long distance buses apparently do not have restroom facility on board, thus - it's common to give riders a rest & time for the ""powder room"" every 1.5 to 2.5 hours. Citibank has a presence here in SK and we've pleasantly surprised to see their bilingual ATM at the rest stop for cars & buses alike. The small village area in front of the rail station has numerous small restaurants & shops, and has restrooms for male & females, making it a popular sightseeing stopover - the cruise ship restaurant perched on a hilltop is not far away & can be easily observed in the parking area."
The great beach in Korea ,"This is my favourite beach in Korea ,very nice beach that not too crowd and great sea for swimming! The view is prefect that you can see the sun cruise resort and the best place for sunrise !"
The most beautiful beach.,"The most beautiful beach in Korea which I never seen it in Korea. I strongly recommend this beach for everyone, the water is very clean as well."
great sunrise view,It is very convenient to go to the beach for the stunning sun rise from the Jeongdongjin station. There are a lot of restaurants that operate even in early morning when we arrive at 4.30am. it was such a great experience with the calm and nice scenery of the beach.
Anniversary trip,"Beautiful beach, amazing view , especially at night.. yummy food .. we enjoy sight seeing.. worth to visit."
Great beach,"We were in Gangneung for a couple of days and decided to go there to check it out. We took the train (regular train) from Gangneung station to go to Jeongdongjin. The trip took aroung 10 minutes and you have a great view on the sea before arriving. One way ticket is around 2500won.When you arrive by train, you are litterally next to the see. I think it's the world clothest station from the sea or something. Since there are almost no train passing by, you can walk on the rails which gives you some great pictures opportunities. Then we went down on the beach and enjoy the see. In June, it was hot enough to swim even though the Koreans didn't seem to agree. I wanted to go see the unification park but it was rather far (I guess you need to take a taxi) and we enjoyed the beach so much we decided to stay there and enjoy a peacefull afternoon."
Sun Cruise Resort and Hourglass / Moraesigye Park,"This is a unique area with an opportunity to take some interesting pictures. Honestly, this is a bit of a ""tourist trap"" but the beach is beautiful with blue water and the ship on top of the mountain is pretty cool.You can get on the train and pay a small fee to walk through it (it does not move), the carriage cars have around 60 antique/old clocks. If you have some extra time, no pun intended, and are in the area then check out this location. For a separate side experience try the food at one of the many restaurants in the area (seafood)."
Beautiful beach,"CYC ( 2014.01.17 ) There was famous for sunrise view. But except sunrise, there was very beautiful beach and had good atmosphere. In the beach, there was a park, museum, and some cafe. In east coast of Korea, many beautiful beach was located, and this beach was good, too. Good beach."
Amazing sunrise,You can see the amazing sunrise at here. That was my first time to see the sun in my raw eyes
Prefer this place than Jeju.,"It's much entwine with nature than beaches in Jeju, with not so many people,although on summer, the locals will swarm the place. It's better to visit the place during Spring. The temperature is just right during that season."
