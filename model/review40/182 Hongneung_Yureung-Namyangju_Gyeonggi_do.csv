Royal tombs of Hongneung and Yureng ,An emperor's royal tombs. Difference from other royal tombs are the details of stone statues in the middle guarding the path way. Very peaceful place. A UNESCO world heritage.
The graves of the last king of Joseon.. Especially Empress Myeongseong who was killed by Japanese blackguard..,"CY ( 2013.05.25 ) There was two tombs. One was tomb of Gojong(25st king of Joeseon) and his wife Empress Myeonsiong, the other was Sunjong(26st, last king of Joeseon) and his wife. There was a diffenrent from another Joeseon's tomb. There are good air and good scenery, and there was museum about Joeseon and tomb. Unfortunately, I should wish to build memorial about Empress Myeonseong who was tragic queen, and dark history of Japanese colony. There was a good place, historically and restfully."
Exalted Tomb of Gojong,"The Hongneung Tomb complex stands in stark difference from tombs of the Joseon dynasty. The design imitates that of Chinese Emporer tombs. This is because King Gojong became Emperor after Japan successfully broke all ties China shared with Korea. Visitors who have visited any other Joseon tombs will recognize this difference in style and layout. While Joseon was in practice a completely independent country from China, the Joseon Dynasty recognized the Chinese Emperor as the first son of heaven and sent envoys to the court with tributes. Japan successfully implemented a policy of divide and conquer in the late 19th century concerning China and Korea. The most exceptional aspect of these tombs is the very large wooden altar to perform the Confucian rites, and the stone guardian statues. The guardian statues are numerous and even include camels. Indeed this is where the imitation of China is the most obvious, because obviously there are no camels on the Korean Peninsula.I've had the opportunity to visit about 10 of the Joseon Dynasty tomb clusters. Hongneung is interesting, but it lacks some of the most unique elements of traditional Joseon tombs that are uniquely Korean. King Gojong and his ill-fated wife are a tragic chapter in Korean history, their remains are found here. It might suprise visitors to learn that this tomb complex is only about 100 years old, the last built by the Joseon dynasty."
