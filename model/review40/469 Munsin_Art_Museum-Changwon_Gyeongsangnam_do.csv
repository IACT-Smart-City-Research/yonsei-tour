Dazzling outdoor sculptures,"What a fabulous discovery the Moon-Shin Art Museum was and to learn about the famous Korean sculptor and painter Moon Shin. For a very small entrance fee of 500 won we were immediately dazzled by the large stainless steel outdoor sculptures, in fact it was quite difficult to view them in the midday sun, intense reflections, so we headed indoors to view the collection. This was a beautiful gallery, welcoming staff, very few other visitors, wide open exhibition rooms with large sculptures and paintings to view at a distance and up close for the fine details. We learned who Moon-Shin was, that he was born in Japan in 1923 and moved to Korea as a child, studied art and practised has craft in Paris for many years and that he is much loved by the South Koreans. In another building his workshop has been set-up for all to see and a large collection of sculpture prototypes. The gallery is located high on the hill in Masan and from the outdoor terraced gardens there are wonderful views over Masan and the harbour. We easily accessed the museum on foot from our hotel down near the harbour, if you are driving up I would think it best to use the carpark next to the Changwon City Masa Museum and walk the short distance."
All for the view.,"The museum displays the sculptures of a local artist. The works are beautiful, but English information is limited. An added benefit to this museum is the view. Amazing! "
outdoor sculpture garden is amazing,"The Moon Shin Museum is an interesting little place. I didn't know much about this sculptor before visiting, and learned a lot. The museum itself is a nice building, but the exhibits are a bit redundant. The outdoor sculptures and surrounding scenery are well worth the climb up to this location, however!"
