A large park with few interesting things to do.,The situated in delta of small river. It has a working salt farm and feet dipping hot spring. Locals come to fish on the small river. Not a park to visit if you are far away. 
the view was mesmerizing,"not a reachable place, but the view is beautiful. I went there just by walking. there was no tourist and not may things to do there, just take a picture and go back "
A MUST see and do for all Artists,"The red bus 1302 takes you there from Seoul station and its route stops. Bus comes every 30 minutes so it is very easy and convenient. Alternatively you can visit by train. Soraepo train station is very clean as it is fairly new and lots from the doorsteps. It can be a full day visit starting from museum, easy walk to the fish market and surrounding parks. From the market, it is only minutes walk to the entrance. There is NO entrance fee which is fantastic! Great to explore different parts of this amazing parkland. So natural and so different from other parks. An absolute healing retreat for the sole and mind. Hope everyone who comes to visit as much as I did. Sunny "
