Good but expencive,"I liked the outdoor hot tubs and the jjimjilbang, but its quite overpriced. I would only go here when I can get a discount."
Pretty lame and very overpriced,Super overpriced (even with a gift card discount). The outdoor hot baths were too cool at only 36 degrees. The place is generally pretty lame and dissapointing. The jimjilban is very limited and very poor with only 3 sauna rooms and no hot baths - which is why i paid more for the waterpark as the hot baths are located there (bit of a con). Would recommend avoiding this place and not waste your money.
Place for young and old,"A place for young and old. There are theme park, hot spring, Korean sauna for everyone. There are 2 different pricings, full day pricing and afternoon pricing. We bought the afternoon pricing at ₩38,000 (S$45.80), that’s from 2PM – 7PM. Once you entered, you will be given a watch, it will act as locker keys, virtual money and a watch. First you will need to place you shoe at level 1, and head to level 2 to change into your swimwear, level 3 are theme park and hot spring (outdoor) and level 4 is Korean sauna.And yes, do remember to deposit some money to the watch. If you are not using, it can be refund fully."
Relaxing ,"The children could play in the water park while the parents could enjoy the hot spring, both outdoor and indoor one. The indoor one is separated into males and females and is located in respective changing room as you can go stark naked in the indoor hot spring. "
"Small, not too many attractions","It's average, there's an indoor side and like 4 slides. The indoor side is basically just for kids and the slides don't impress. It's definitely not the highlight of the resort, guess it counts more like just its pool side."
Too expensive on the extra's + Rules and regulations spoil the fun,"60.000 KRW (+-52 USD) & 45.000 KRW (39 USD) (adult & child) which is not cheap and then realizing, once inside, that you have to pay extra for things one would expect to be 'FREE' and / or included! If you wanna go inside the wave pool (one of the main attractions) you need to wear a life jacket beyond a certain line for the deeper part (for your safety they say in Korean - don't expect English from the majority of the staff!) but you need to pay a deposit for this 5.000 / 4.000 KRW (adult/child)! For starting, I can swim so I don't need a life jacket (as do my 2 small kids!) and 2nd, they should offer it for free (included in the already expensive entry ticket).Sitting outside and enjoying some sunbathing is not possible unless you pay for a sitting chair or a small cabinet! No 'FREE' seating available outside w.t.*.!!! Going to a swimming resort, you'd expect to be able to lay down at some time to rest and / or enjoy some nice sun shine; nope, not here, pay first!!!And rules and regulations is something typical Korean I suppose, though my wife (Korean) doesn't agree on it as well as we have been living overseas and have seen that you can also have fun without them. The kids couldn't enjoy some (for the oldest boy) or any (for the youngest boy) of the slides with and without tubes! We have been to water parks in Belgium, Middle-East, Singapore, Sri Lanka and other places that I forget here, some regulated (like Singapore) but most not as strict as in this one (or other amusement parks in Korea f.e. Lotte World in Seoul) and the boys were enjoying the fast glides the most, even the small one. Both boys love speed, love action, can swim and we are of course always joining them on those slides. But even then, nope, not allowed because less then 120 / 140 cm! This is not only a problem for this water park, it is a general 'over caring' thing in Korea we think. Let the kids play and experience there own boundaries, which includes sometimes hurting themselves yes. Don't make to many 'rules and regulations' is our point of view."
Have to wear head coverings but fun when it was too cold to ski,A heads up about the very liberal nakedness in the change rooms- had to help the kids deal with that- but its a cultural thing both ways- the park was not that big- and it was fun to muck around in- but nothing compared to home ones-also our kids were exceptional swimmers and kept scaring the life guards with underwater swimming- funny to watch them panic when the kids were under for ages- They seem not to be good swimmers there! It was great for a laugh and to sit outside in minus 20 and freeze your hair in outside hot tubs! So if you want to break up the time of skiing then go for it- but dont go to this resort just for this park- !! We had a good laugh all day though!
Kitsch but great fun on a cold day,"This place has a two great water, a lazy river, massage jets in pools, outdoor coloured spas, a wave pool (have to wear a life vest at additional cost) and a younger kids water playground. Dated but fun. "
Peak Water Park,This is a must for after ski relaxation for a few hours. Food is also sold.Tips: bring your own one piece swim suit and cap (baseball cap is ok). 
Poor Poor water park,"My advice is, no need to waste your time to go to this water park AT ALL.If you have been to many water park before, especially the water park in Singapore at Santosa, this water park is consider very small, items are limited. Worst of all, if you want to go deeper water, you need to RENT a Life Jacket, not cheap, at Korean won 4,000 where Singapore giving for free.Also, when we step into their water park lobby, we need to take off your shoe... (Do not know why), after putting your shoe in a small shoe locker, then they give you another locker for your towel etc. Many restriction applied.The water is not really hot enough especially in the winter. The air is freezing near the door and you need to use the staircase to the change room. You will be freezing with wet body on the way to the changing room.Perhaps there will be fun for age 2 to 6? My son aged 8 just play for 30 minutes already wanting to go back to the hotel room.The ice cream cost me Korean won 7,000 for a small scoop, worst still, I left mine and my son's swimming trunk there, next day it disappeared and could not be found again.We were not impressed at all. We will never go to this water park again, it is also a distance of walking to the water park from our hotel, walking thru a big outdoor car park."
Great relaxing,"Spent almost two hours in the water park. It is good to wind down with a relaxing hot spring bath after a day of travelling. The changing room is very small inside a only three toilets room. Some even changed clothes in the locker area. MUST bring your swimming cap (like in Taiwan). Inside the warm water spa area, there are some spa for different part of the body such as massage the back, shoulder, legs or feet.., but there is no any picture or description, you need to try each spa area to find it out."
Amazing water park for all ages.,"If you stay at Yongpyong resort, you can get 50% discount for water park. It is amazing and beautiful water park really for all ages. On my travel, it's too cold to enjoy the park."
Average,Water park is well facilitated. The Water slides are in small scale. Good for family outing. Nothing spectacular.
Something different,- We liked the outdoor hot-water pools (the outdoor temp. was -10 deg. C); the massage pools and the tube slides- Dislike that we need to rent PFD in order to get into one of the wave pools.
