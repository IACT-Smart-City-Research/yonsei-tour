Fascinating ,"This review is in three parts - the Observatory, its accompanying museum, and the new DMZ museumWe drove hire car so getting there not a problem. When we got to the military checkpoint, about 5 km out, a pleasant, young soldier explained in passing english that we had to turn around and go back to the other side of a tunnel, turn off and get the pass we needed there. We followed those instructions and they were fine. At the office, located in the back of a souvenir shop, a man gave us a form and english translation for how to fill it in. We paid him 6000 won. When we had completed the form we handed it to another bloke and he took 5000 won. We think 1 was the Pass fee, the other the Observatory fee.We returned northwards, the soldier greeted is worth a cheery 'welcome back'. Car, boot was checked. Given some instructions about not photographing military and a bright yellow card to put on dashboard.We went to the DMZ museum first. We were in by 9.05 and the only ones there for an hour or more. Another very good S Korea museum, in parts. It focuses more on the DMZ than the War. There is english on the ground floor, though more would be better, but little on the upper floor. It is all very modern. We them drove the 2km or so to the Observatory. You park below and it is uphill walk to the building. There there are outside platforms to look across to the border. There are also some pay for binoculars. If you look carefully you can make out a ridge running fence and path away in the distance. All looks pretty desolate It looks like they are building a higher modern observatory, all stainless steel and height, but when open don't know. Only date we could make out on the building screens was 2017, so they're late. Across the car park there is then the War Museum. Pretty depressing and aging somewhat. Also hardly any english there, just some English headings above Korean writing We were in the area for about 3 hour and it took more than an hour each way from Sokcho. At no stage were poor passports checked. Nor were we stopped from taking pictures at the observatory towards the borderCertainly an historical and fascinating place to visit"
View of the North,"Pretty amazing, hard to get to if you don't have a car and no buses go right to the observatory so plan your trip."
Not quite what I was expecting ,Did this as part of an organised tour run by Hanjin Tours. Not quite sure what I was expecting but ended up being a little disappointed by the experience. You get taken to an observatory where you can see the DMZ in the distance and there are a few artefacts (and some art) to look at. Didnâ€™t get to see any guards etc.
Experience,This was a great experience and a must see if you visit South Korea. You can see where North Korea starts and the observatory has a great history.
A unique and most do experience while in South Korea,"Probably hard to reach without a car. You have to stop and register 10 km before reaching the guards. Feels a bit tensed while passing, but once you're in it feels like you're in a tourist area again. Not crowded at all, at least not in March. The observatory is easy to reach, it's a five minute walk up a hill. The view is great, I would even say beautiful, but of course its chilling when you think of what you are actually looking at. You can se the border and far away a small city. Not too much information in english, but it's not a big problem. Among the most interesting and unique things we did while in South Korea."
Great views,"Not sure how easy this is to access via public transport. Most drive. You must stop 10km south of the observatory and fill out a form and pay. Then you are shepherded 30 vehicles at a time along the road, in and out of weaving tank traps and barbed wire. Car will be checked out by ROK military and then a 2km drive to the observatory. There is a white building on the left at the top of the hill with uninterrupted views over North Korea's beaches. In the car park there is a small, awfully presented museum (free) about military life. It was mostly fascinating for its awfulness. Not many food options here. "
"This one has improved a lot since I last visited, 20+ years ago","The drive from Seoul is not hard, maybe 120 miles, and then all the way north on Highway 7. The ""educational"" film is 4 minutes all told. 2 minutes on the rules, the rest is all about how awesomely Korea put itself back together, better than ever, following the war. The restaurant at the site is a train, you eat inside. Korean food (Hwang tae is the local fix of choice) is good there, but I tried Pizza Don Katsu, so pizza fixings deep fried together--might fine. The observatory allows you to look into NK, but nobody is visible, probably ever. The beaches are beautiful, and sadly fenced off until who knows when to stop infiltrations from the north. The museum at the observatory is free and has a very interesting section on South Korea efforts to recovery missing war dead from around the country. Also a great display of how many UN troops from what countries came and fought and died here. When you leave the slightly run-down observatory place there is a new and beautiful DMZ museum just down the road, very nice. Interactive themes for kids and a lot to look at. Gift shop is nice too. This entire day is great cheap and easy if you speak Korean. If not, find a friend to go along."
today of korea unification,you can know today of korean unification and see north korea's nowadays.
If you want to see north Korea,If you want to see north korea safely and know the sad history of Korean division
DMZ visit,"The most interesting part was the DMZ museum. It gives good explanations in English, though everything isn't translated. The staff at the museum speaks good English and will be able to help you with directions to the observatory. Though it isn't hard since it's on your left when getting out of the museum and there is only one road. The observatory isn't that much of a big deal we thought. Try going there by good weather if you want a chance of actually seeing something. And if you are going by your own means, you will need a car to get there since they don't let motorcyclists or pedestrians in. Don't forget to get the paperwork done in Machajin at the Tongil security park. The staff there doesn't speak English but patience, good will, your best efforts and a smile will get you there :)"
The Farthest North DMZ View,"This is the farthest north anyone can travel to see the DMZ. There is also a GREAT location to see a wonderful DMZ Museum a little south of the the Unification Observatory (as you drive north on Route 7 the Museum will be on your Left. It's a brand new building and you can't miss it). The Unification Observatory is fantastic because you can take photos anywhere along the DMZ (seriously there are no restrictions).To get there: Drive north on Route 7 (you will feel like you are about to drive in to North Korea, the road has many turns so be careful), You will see several cars turn off to the left at a building that is painted white/redish orange on your left (stop at this building and by a pass...if you do not by a pass then you will be forced to turn around by the military and go get a pass), the pass is inexpensive (less than 10,000 won or $10 dollars), the staff there speak very limited english so bring a picture of the license plate that is posted in my post and hold up your passport and/or money, pay for the paperwork, fill out the paperwork (there is an english translation example they have to help you translate), then stand in the next line and pay a second small fee for the processing of the paperwork to travel north, then get in your car and manuever your way out of the rows of cars, then drive north (turn left out of the parking lot), then you will reach a Republic of Korea Army Gate and they will ask for your paperwork, the soldier will hand you a license plate and then you will continue driving north on Route 7. Basically, most anyone that is in this region is there for the exact same reason...just follow them! Take your time on the drive and be transported back to a very different and much more harsh way of life in South Korea. The trip to this remote part of South Korea is well worth the adventure and one excursion you will always remember!Website:http://english.visitkorea.or.kr/enu/SI/SI_EN_3_1_1_1.jsp?cid=264161"
