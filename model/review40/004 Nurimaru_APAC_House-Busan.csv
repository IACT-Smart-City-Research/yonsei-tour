Gorgeous historical attraction! Loved it,"The nice thing about the place is how much history it holds while also having an amazing location overlooking natural greatness. The place is really grand and nice, and you can learn about the summit as you visit. Itâ€™s also in a location that allows you to visit many other spots while visiting it, which I found very convenient and nice~"
I don't get it,"I really don't get the point of this APEC house. Why don't they do something nice with the building? It's a nice building, but they kept it exactly the same as at the time of the summit. Who cares what those leaders had for dinner back then, or who sat where during the meeting? Luckily it's free."
An Historical House ??,"The people of Busan are clearly proud of this venue but I found it hard to get excited over a building where the leaders of APEC's twenty one members signed the Busan Declaration way back in November 2005.The House was apparently built (at great expense !), specifically for the event. At the entrance is a panel of lacquer work, inlaid with mother of pearl and showing the 12 symbol of longevity !!"
Quick visit into a piece of history,"Its on Camilla island as you walk around Heundae beach. Free to visit, you'll walk around the displays to understand its history."
"Nice setting, but could have provided more historical context","The building was at the top of a path that would have been too challenging for some but the Guide did not mention this. Attractively set overlooking the sea, the building was expensive to build so it is no surprise there was discontent with the original plan to take it down after the event.Worth a visit but it is a shame there was not more information provided on historical context."
Of historical interest,"Out main goal was to walk around Dongbaek park, and we visited this site along the way. It's clear that the South Korean people are proud of the role they played on the national stage for this event."
Pretty setting,"This is an elegant building with Korean touches round the supporting pillars. There is a beautiful picture at the entrance and the gardens surrounding it are lovely. The diamond bridge, the longest suspension bridge in Korea can be seen from here. "
Like a Little UN House,"If you enjoy the locations where global economics are discussed you will enjoy this visit. There is a Peace Garden, Conference room for events. The best part is the Photo Gallery and the meeting rooms as they were set up for the 2005 APEC summit. Admission is free and entrance is between 9:00 and 17:00."
In and Out Look,I came across this buy chance as I was walking from the beach. Built for the 2005 APEC conference the building gives an insight into the vast expense of hosting such an event. Inside you will get the opportunity to look at the meeting room where the leaders of APEC met and you also get to see memrobilia from the meeting. You will get some great views from the building across the bay and to the lighthouse. Certainly worth a quick visit and it is free. 
<3,"A nice place to see, walk and breath. This is the first time I come here but I like this green and this sea so much :)"
Nice piece of architecture in a stunning setting,"The location of structure is at the end of a very green park. There are few flowers in the park, but the trees are big and the walk is cool. The reward for the long walk is the view of the APAC House--a very dramatic piece of architecture set over the water. The inside is interesting, but not great.The views over the water are beautiful and you can walk down to it if you are so inclined. The setting is great! When you walk out of the park, the view of the city skyline is quite nice. It is a very beautiful and modern city of 5.5 million!"
Interesting and easy to visit,"The place is an interesting visit, as you can enter the room where the Asian leaders met on one of their summits... you can imagine the meeting itself. Then, the building is of great modern design, nice to the eye, enjoyable to navigate and not that big, so the visit is easy and light. However one of the big pluses is the scenery around the place, amazing views of Haeundae `beach and of the suspended bay bridge at the other side,... unique place, and it is in the middle of a very clean and neat park.... lovely place to visit."
Great meeting place,This must have been quite a meeting when it was held. The rooms are beautifull decorated and there are many photos of the delegates.
"Not much to see , not worth a visit","You may go there as this is free of charge if you happen to walk in Dongbaek Park , this place doesn't have much to offer . Just enjoy the views and the nearby park ."
Pleasant Walk,Pleasant walk towards the APAC House. good scenery. Small exhibit area. Good clean toilets inside the building.
"It's suppose to be APEC house, I think","Never bothered to know exactly which were Asia Pacific countries (despite being a citizen of one) before I went there, now I know! I find the location most interesting, right in the middle of such a panoramic view. Wouldn't mind attending a meeting here myself ;-)"
An Interesting Sight,"It is not often that a country makes a building for a conference and then entrenches that conference into history. This is what APAC House is. It celebrates the Asia-Pacific conference held in Busan. You can see where each of the heads of government for their respective countries sat, who they were next to, the masterpiece, as it was called to my travelling party, and not much more. However, the grounds are well set out and definitely worth the stroll to the building. The views over the city are excellent and there is an excellent mermaid sculpture leading up to the hill made out of recycled plastic. Have a look but don't be expected to be amazed."
and so what,"I guess the APEC meeting was quite monumental for Busan, but to turn it into a museum - a bit over the top. Even reproductions of the food they ate. If they turned the place into a restaurant/cafe then it would be a real good place to visit with its views. But other than to kill 10 minutes as you wonder through the park, don't go out of your way. Free to enter."
A historical building,The Nurimaru APEC House was built for the 2005 APEC summit. This is a tourist attraction on Dongbaek Island. We came here using metro line 2 and exiting at Dongbaekseom Station (exit 1). There is no entry fee and you are free to walk around this building and look at the exhibits. We were fortunate to arrive here in the late afternoon and managed to watch a beautiful sunset here. There is a cafe on the lower level.
Nice view,From here you can see the famous bridge and the beautiful beach. I go to here by 1008 number bus and take a long distance by walk by the side of beach to see APEC HOUSE. 
The United Nations of ASEAN,"This building is situated in a waterfront park. You can tour the building and rooms used by the ASEAN leaders when they meet. It is modern, regal and has great views as well. "
Interesting and scenic,"Great location, interesting architecture and a fine way to spend a morning or afternoon. Walk, jog, or picnic."
Take photo stand at your country,There is a very nice sea view and sunset view. There have a area for photo taking. The photo taking area is face to the best view of Busan. 
Beautiful historical site on the sea,"We saw the APEC house on a cruise tour of Busan. It's located on the side of a small mountain right next to the sea. You can see the skyline of Busan, enjoy the forested mountain, and even see a small island of Japan in the distance."
Architecture,After A long raining day I be been walking in the forest garden and discord this place the apac houseIf you like architecture this place should fulfill your curiosity 
Something educational,"Historical meeting places during the APEC Leaders (2nd APEC Leaders' Meeting, Leaders' Luncheon, and the Official Photograph took place during APEC 2005 KOREA)- Hours: 10:00 ~ 17:00 / Admission: Free / No guide - tour is pretty straight forward just follow the sticker foot print- Plenty to read and explore- YAY !! We saw our Prime Minister :) in the board of leaders- Awesome place to take pictures :)Tips:- Camera and plenty of water (they have a tiny shop selling some snacks at the ground floor)- Don't forget to check out the Master piece ""Mother of all pearl"" art"
Didn't really know what this was...,"...until inside. Nice scenery outside. Free but it was just a building. If you really have anything else to do, check it out but thats it. Don't expect much :D"
Some where to spend a short time,Outside the views are beautiful as it is position is elevated. Looking around inside doesn't take look but what you see gives you a sense of history as you look at all the countries involved. It is worth a visit here and was part of a tour. Would I feel the same if I had come to see this on its own - perhaps not.
Great building,"It's my first time to go to South Korea. Although I was not going inside the building, from the outside it looks gorgeous. And I wish I could go there someday "
Just stop by..,"It's a place to stop by for a short time, and maybe for a free restroom break, during the walk in the dong baek island park/trail. "
A quick glance,"Place is interesting. Saw where the delegates of each country were seated, the type of food they ate during APEC 2005. Worth checking out. "
Nurimaru APAC House,"This is a modern house where an APAC meeting wre held under the administration of Muhyun Noh. There, you can look over the sea of Haeundae area."
Scenic Nurimaru,"The Nurimaru Convention Centre was the site of the 2005 APEC Leaders meet.The main building sits on top of a knoll with a commanding view of the sea and the oark surrounding it. The view to the right is the Gwangan marine bridge all the way to Grand Lotte Hotel area. On a clear day and when the atmosphere is right, one can see the outermost island of Japan.The tall glass windows spanning 3 floors of the Centre allows the same perfect view. There's a traditional Korean garden next to the Centre, with a pretty gazebo and a sundeck to take pictures and to enjoy the seaview. Listen to the waves crashing onto the rocks. The contrast between the serenity of the garden and park with birds chirping and the wild waves crashing - 'Beauty and the Beast'.Take a walk inside the Centre to see a bit of history. The items and utensils used by the Leaders. The traditional Royal Court meals served. It's miniature plastic representation of course. Listen to the narration. Various languages available.A microcosm of modern Korea still practising its ancient traditions.It was a wonderful rxperience."
Best convention center,The convention house APAC is very beautiful and historical and very beautiful designed and attracts everyone everything belong to here is well placed and mostly recommended
Meeting Place of the Great and the Good,"APEC House (not APAC as sometimes listed) sits at the end of Dongbaekseom Island in the Haeundae Beach area of Busan. The Island in reality is no longer an island but a prominentary due to land reclamation. APEC House is a circular three storey building akin to a large flying saucer. It was completed in 2005 to host the APEC (Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation) Conference held on 18/19 November that year.The upper level is laid out as it was for the Leaders' discussions in 2005, with the circular conference table set below an impressive dome. The design of the ceiling was based on the Buddhist Seokguram Temple at Gyeongju. Informative displays show how the Leaders were dressed in traditional Korean costume, with examples of the choice of blue or gold colours. The obligatory official photograph of the meeting is also on display. Observation areas provide stunning views of the local area.Whilst the top level of the building remains as a museum having been used only once other than the 2005 APEC conference, the next level down offers a conference suite for private hire. Stairways lead down to attractively laid out parkland.The House and surroundings provide an interesting visit."
APAC house,"This House was built to host summit leaders of APAC (Asia Pacific economic Cooperation) in 2005, there are round table where all leaders meet,large auditorium, on walls Korean stile pictures,and view on ocean,and forest around. It worth after visiting APAC stroll in forest and go to ocean view."
