Great Place to Checkout!,"This is an incredible area of Seoul worth checking out. If you are young and visiting Seoul for the first time, I would also suggest staying in the Hongdae area, it's really never a dull moment here even at night time. Amazing restaurants that are very affordable, cheap street food and of course arts as well. You can also check out the Hongdae Free Market on Saturdays."
lively and great for teenagers,"it was a ncie street, full of cute lil things. it is basically for teenagers especially for girls. They have many quaint lit shop that sell cosmetic, jewelleries, accessories and clothings too."
nice street,For my opinion should go on the night. you can saw so mouch live music and dancer on the street it was enjoy.Also you can buy clothes in the street
Hongik University Peonpeon Slime Cafe,"It is a good place to relieve stress not only by children but alsoadults at slime cafes. The inside of the cafe is clean and the staff is kind. The price is low, soyou can build memories with friends and get closer. As soon as you start to touch it with yourhands, you will feel better."
Very Chic,"This area has a California Berkeley University flare. Diverse eatery’s, beer, coffee houses, etc. The metro stop is in the middle. A great kick back place a cute walking area."
Lively!,"Pretty cool. Lots of activity. Right behind and parallel to the street, in the evening, it is bustling. Lots of people, restaurants, and K-Pop bands showcasing their skills!"
Gotta get some street food,"Plenty of good people watching, shopping, and eating to do here. You can walk for a while and eat your way along. Fun way to spend a couple hours exploring some of the local area."
"Shopping, food and so much fun","Hongdae shopping street comes alive at night. Highly recommended to stay near the area if you enjoy street food with reasonably priced restaurants, fashionable streetwear, clubbing/bar hoping and noraebong (karaoke rooms). Everything night is a Friday night so a warning to those who don’t enjoy crowds and noise until the wee hours of the morning. "
Student town,"Lots of food and bars, very reasonably priced, also good for shopping. Much busier then Ewha Women’s University. A must visit spot."
Amazing Food,"There is food all over this area, From Korean BBQ, to Sushi, to Bibimbap, Coffee Shops you name it. My personal favorite is Bibiri for Affordable Delicious Bibimbap. It is in a basement and hard to find, but totally worth it."
"Great Fun, bustling nightlife","Great Chicken and Beer restaurant, great Bars, for the young at heart. Crowded but great vibe with a huge variety of places. "
Very good crab restaurant in the area,We visited the area solely for the purpose of having a crab dinner at the restaurant called Kim & Kim. If you like giant crab this is a good place to go. It is near the station on Line 2.
Don’t go in the monrong,Hongdae I’m sure is a great and lively place to visit. We made the rookie error of going at 9.30am one Sunday. It was a ghost town. I guess it wakes up in the afternoon and certainly the shops were closed until 11.30. So just time your visit accordingly!
Freshmen ,Crowded with freshman age people. In the morning you can shop for a bit and at night you can also club here.
Place where the art is start,In here you can enjoy so many performances by the young korean in the street. Also the stores and food that they sell in here are a lot. So you can have a lot of selection of food that you can enjoy. This place is also heaven for the people who likes shopping.
Young and Vibrant ,It’s an area full of university students. You can feel the vibe and energy. Relaxing area to shop and dine. I enjoy sitting in the café while the rest shop. 
hip and young,The Hongik University Street is full of young people. If you look for some fashionistas its the place to go. 
Garden theme cafe and shop!!! Inner peace ,"Spending Sunday afternoon at Hongik University street... plenty of cafes, clothes, restaurants, pub and live performances.Indeed a place for young blood ... feel the sugar/blood rush!!! *_^"
Great Vibe,I was on my way to a workshop and accidentally ended up in this area. I love the park area and all the people! Great young vibe without it being overwhelming.
Unique creative atmosphere!,"Very interesting, peculiar, dynamic district of Seoul. A lot of youth, creativity, music. Lovely cafes and youth clothing stores. I think that next time I will stay in this area."
Typical shopping for cheap clothing and souvenirs.,"The street is full of stall vendors selling unbranded , hip and mod clothing for the 20 somethings.... The quality is above average for these types of stores. The value was pretty good considering the USD vs KRW exchange rate."
Large Beautiful Landscape and Facilities,"One of our travel mates with teaching the summer session and we went to support him a give a brief presentation on Criminal Justice. They university was so happy that we volunteered our time they gave us a takeaway good bag and provided us with dinner. such a great experience, top quality staff."
"Young people, Busking, Restaurants and Shopping area","The street is located near the university so there're a lot of young people. There're so many busking and it's really fun to watch them perform singing or dancing. There're a lot of stores, cafe and restaurants. I really enjoyed the area."
Great vibe,"Visit in the evening/night time, great vibe, lots of shops and food, and street performers, cafes, karaoke, should have a visit. "
Too Convenient - 太方便了,"We enjoyed too much about the area. It even has great breakfast restaurants & shops. It has many famous flagship shops for many famous brands locally & internationally suck as Kakao, Line Friends & shoe and cloth. It has restaurants & street vendors everywhere, with street artists & performance on and off to create the variety & richness of the area. It is easy accessible to go everywhere in town including the airport, and subway system nicely makes here a hub. 我們真的太喜歡這一區了！甚至有很多吃早餐的餐廳和小店（首爾很多地區都沒那麼方便吃早餐），很多國內國外的旗艦店都在這一區，例如Kakao, Line Friends和鞋子、服飾店，到處都有餐廳和路邊攤，還有不時出現的街頭藝人和表演，讓這裡更多樣化和豐富性，從這兒到哪裡都方便，包括機場，而地鐵系統讓這裡成為一個很好的轉運站。"
Good vibes!,"Lots of energy and lots of people hanging out at night, with live music and street performances - this street is hip for the university crowd. Throw in an abundance of quirky shops, cafes, restaurants and clubs, and you can start feeling younger yourself. So go feel the energy - it's contagious, and free!"
Stayed 3 days here - Truly korean,"Reading all the reviews here on trip advisor i stayed 3 days here and 2 days at Itaewon.I have to say - i liked it better here. Itawon is very touristy, so if you need to get a true flavor of Korea, stay here, The streets are very busy- i'd say till 12 midnight on weekdays, and till early am 8am on weekends. They have some amazing Barbeque places @ 9000 KRW for Pork/Beef Barbeque that gives you free sides and a dedicated table to cook, But u need to order minimum 2 dishes. amazing experience + music on the streets is fantastic. Very lively, loved it here."
Must see,"After living in Korea for some time I can say I know Hongdae really well even though I’m not living as near. I like it for having foreign brands stores, such as h&m, forever21 etc. Also, it’s a great place to buy some other stuff, cheap smartphone cases and cosmetics - in one place. There are many, many pretty cafes near, very instagramable places. Also, be sure to visit Yongnamdong (Hongik Uni St. exit 3) for some really good food. "
2nd time visit,"Lots of teenager or young guys there, street performances, lots of restaurant, coffee shop, and cosmetics shop, accessories and everything. Love to visit this places , so go 2nd time because it is easy to find great food and lots to buy "
best place to hang around in the evening,very lively street where you can see a lot of street performers every night. on top of that it is full of small bars and restaurants and definitely worth checking out.
Go at night,"That whole area is very busy and bustling, but it gets interesting once the sun starts setting and different people start performing. A fun place to spend time or sprint through if you have seen it once too many times."
Holiday,"Blown away by the vibe of this place. I am 72 years old and this place excited me. Street performances, shops, bars, restaurants and crowds make the atmosphere electric. Easy to walk and spend a few hours just observing. I walked till 10:30 pm and the place was jumping. Furthermore I never felt unsafe. Put it on the must do list. Excellent. "
Must visit esp if you travel with teens,My 16 yr old son absolutely loved the vibe here. Lovely place to walk around and the atmosphere is different in the day and evening. There are always a lot of teens ganging around the place. Couple of vintage stores to check out and 3 animal cafes located within walking distance. Do visit Bau House (loads of friendly dogs) and Meerkat & Friends cafe. Plenty of BBQ choices and street performers. The place is packed weekends night and abuzz with excitement till post midnight. 
Interesting street,"So much happenings here when we visited on a Saturday. There are so many streets performances by various individuals and they are all quite good. Food aplenty and lots of shops selling clothes, cosmetics and spectacles etc. "
Fun performers!,We just happened to walk by this place without any expectation of seeing much but we were surprised to see a few different dance groups performing for the crowds! We ended up watching for a while and the dancers were quite good. We didn't explore the rest of the area too much but it looked like there was some street food and some cute shops.
Great place to shop,Will go again as it is a good place to shop. Things here selling at reasonable price. Good for girls who love to shop. 
Hongdae,"get out from subway Hongik univ u'll find Hongdae street activities n nice bbq pork n beef , crowded !!! "
My #imightSEOULyou trip @Hongik university,If you go to seoul its a must to go here. You can see young people performing song or dancing its really entertaining.
Good place ,"Good place for shopping or meeting. Lots of shop with variety of goods and things to eat. In the afternoon, there are lots of street show; dance, music, etc. Some shops close late at night. "
Full of people.,"It was really busy. Bustling to be exact. There was a cafe or something called **Tiger and I've never seen a line this long. There are a lot of restaurants and retail stores. The layout of these neighborhood streets are unique here in Korea, but once you've seen one area you've seen them all. I didn't get a sense of much handmade goods or any unique boutiques. The brands were unfamiliar to me as I'm not used to the K-Brands, but it was fun to be around this area. I did get a hipster feel to here. Like many areas they had big department stores and it felt the crowd here was a bit younger, maybe late teens to young 20's. It's worth a stop and visit. Bring some cash, these districts aren't cheap.Also it seems this would be a good place for night life, but I was here during the afternoon. Smoking a cigar in this area, you stand out."
Lots to see and do,Highly recommend staying in this area. So many cool bars and places to eat. Great location that has literally everything you’d like to see in korea. Chimaek (chicken and beer combos) 24hr Korean bbqs Shopping mallsLive performances 
Free drinks!!,Come join our parties in Club Vera in Hongdae! For free drinks and free entry contact me on kakaotalk: jadawelin or dm me on instagram @vera.jada !!!

"Great area for eating, drinking and a night out",This is a very vibrant and busy area with so many restaurants and bars to chose from. There are both big and small places and many up the many alleys either side of the main street. A great place for an evening out and getting a feel for the less conservative side to Seoul.Street performances are here too along with nightclubs with a friendly vibe. Completely safe and fun.
Cool vibes and lots of good eating places,Vibrant feel and a lot of shops to see and good restaurants to eat at. The train is conveniently located and it's near to clubs if one likes to check out the night scene.
"K-pop groups street performances, food & shopping","Second time we visited Seoul, we decided to stay at a hotel close to this street (stayed at Myeongdong last trip). And we really like this place!K-pop performanceEveryday in the evenings, there are k-pop groups performing on the streets. It’s not some trashy performance like you see on tourist overloaded places. It’s performance on designated places where they dance and sing with large crowds. Food & drinkThere are both street food and restaurants here, overall cheaper than Myeongdong but much more places. There are some places open 24/7 and a lot of great bars and nightclubs. Great vibe during weekends!ShoppingYou have a few large shopping stores (HM, Bershka, Forever21 etc), small stores and “street stores”. And of course a lot of beauty stores. "
Buzzing with life,"All tourists should experiene hongdae street. Great for shopping, eating out and also for watching performances. (great for nights out too but I dont go to bars/clubs) They usually take place from 6pm-10pm, mostly on weekends but you can also catch some great performers on weekdays. I enjoyed spending my evenings in Hongdae"
Cool street. Always something going on. Tons of restaurants!,"There is almost always something going on here. Day or night. Live music in the street. Other types of street performances, too. Restaurants galore. Street food. Definitely a young crowd, most of the time."
"Hip vibe, great street foods & shopping","If you want to experience a young & artsy vibe, you must visit Hongdae. There are street performers, yummy street food, sale shops galore, etc. Really exciting vibe! Next time, I will get a hotel near Hongdae so we can spend more time experiencing their night scene. Can't wait!"
Lively street full of youngsters! ,"Hongik University Street, also known as Hongdae is a very lively shopping street, similar to Myeongdong shopping street. It’s an area in which many youngsters hangout with their friends. There are many shops at Hongdae, along with a ton of Korean Barbecue restaurants, and traditional Korean restaurants. "
Another vibrant place! ,Love the vibe at this place. I was fortunate enough to visit this area on a Saturday night. It’s filled with people and buskers. The buskers put in their heart and soul in their performances.A nice way to spend a Saturday evening. 
Happy vibe!,There is always a crowd in this street. The happy vibe is contagious.Rented an AirBnB in the area and I was not disappointed. You get to see a lot of stuff here. Food choices are every where. Shops are many.
1 st time seing street show,"We discover another pary of Seoul visiting the area of Hongik university and its painted walls, the streets full of people and great shops, good restaurant and bar.We liked in particular the singers and dancers found on the streept.Grab your camera and video if you visit Hongik university. "
Great night out ,You 100 percent need to go to this area during your visit to Seoul. It’s brilliant and has really good atmosphere.
Awesome street dance party,Me and me family especially my teenage kids enjoyed the various dance groups and singing groups and artists performing at Hongik University Street. There are also several food options and shopping!!! Super enjoyed it!
Fun place to be!,"Great vibe and lots of energy on these streets. Great expressions and performances. From what we experienced on a weekday in November, this place was quiet and like a ghost town at 9am. Things started perking up around noon, then came alive in the afternoon. We didn't stay for the evening, but imagine it must have been a big block party all over."
Studied here for exchange!,"I have exchange with Hanyang University during the summer here. It is nice place as there are lots of cafes, restaurants and things to do! Also, Han River is nearby and I love to run there in the morning."
Too crowded,"It was just too packed. Lots of great restaurants there and cheap place for great clothing. Also I have to love the ""butter"" shop inside the Hongik Station (near exit 6 if you are interested). "
Buzzing with great energy,"I absolutely loved roaming around this street. Although it is very busy (which was surprising with the temperature being below zero) I never felt overwhelmed by the crowd as I often do in other places. It is so full of life, with street performers and food vendors and plenty of good (and affordable) shops lining each side. The street performers were young dance groups and musicians, which were much more enjoyable than say, the robot people in Times Square or the kazoo men in Barcelona; these performers were genuinely entertaining. If you are in Seoul, it is worth spending at least a day in this lively neighbourhood. "
Hongdae is the living heart of Seoul,"Always full of people, lights, music and such. Anytime of day and night you will find animation here, it's really a trendy place. "
Nice to walk around,"It's definitely a tourist place when you visit Korea, although it might peak sometimes it is worth to walk around. A shopping paradise, have a break, walk around. Let yourself missing in the area. "
Lively street,Lovely and lively street with loads of restaurants and shops. Gets really crowdes in the evenings especially on weekends. Still safe and interesting place to hang out!
"Lots of food, shopping and entertainment!!!!","I like to come here to kill time and shop. You can shop, go to cafe, eat street food, and watch street entertainment, especially in the summer time or when the weather is nicer. You can see many different talents on the street, trying to make it big :). I like it, the area is a nice way to stop and watch from all the shopping and eating that you have done for the day. You can see many different performances, such as, magic show, singing, tricks, dance, and etc. Also, Hongik University is nearby, so there is a back way where you can see where all the cool kids hangout, if you are into that. You can see people rapping, singing and dancing over there. "
Shopping Place,"We took subway green line 2 from euljiro 1 to hongik station ( direct line ) = 10min from myeongdong area. There are many shops to sell cheap bags and clothes. I bought 2 bags @10000 won. There are so many korean bbq restaurants. There are some cosmetic shops such as Ettude House, Faceshop, etc."
Lovin’ the vibe,"One of my fav place in Seoul, for sure. It has this chic vibe. There are so many good and not expensive restaurants (맛집) here and so many good little boutiques. There’s a movie cinema too and one of the Nanta show theatre is located here."
Exciting atmosphere,"Hard to explain what exactly this place is about...it has good shopping street, loads of small eateries to sink your teeth into, and not to mention the street performances by what seems to be young budding K-pop singers, dancers, performers, etc."
Harry Porter cafe,"Went to this Harry Porter themed cafe. 3 floor of decoration similar to the movie. Quite interesting. You can borrow the Harry Porter robe to do you IG shot. However there are only 3 robes, find it if you can."
Amazing ,"Have everything restaurant,shopping , street food crowdedness but manageable you will enjoy many makeup and natural creams shop for ladies who skin care fan , shopping princess not expensive just be selective "
Better Then That Other Place,Hi. It's me again.... the guy who is not much into shopping centers. Well this one surprised me a bit. I do not know if it was the lay out of the center or if it was more organized. I did not get to visit this center at night but during the day I enjoyed the shipping experiece with my companion. I would recommend this place over that Myedong..... whatever place.... Happy traveling folks.
Shopping and food,"I could see why many people reviewed that this is a place for the young crowd. We enjoyed walking around and shopping (oh yes, the 10,000won bag shops!) and eating. Watched a group or two perform. Unfortunately it was just too cold for us (-9C that day excluding wind chill) so we left after about 2-3 hrs. Would have loved to spend more time. Next time!"
The Most Happening Street in Seoul,"You can see students dancing on the road. The street food is very tasty and the price is reasonable. The market closes at around 11 pm in night but after that you can see the crowd in the club street. You can find the information guide person wearing the red dress, they will give information about the area and also explain everything on map. I recommend to visit Saturday evening."
Mix of locals and tourists,Quite a bit to see here and shop around. Spent a half day here and enjoyed the stroll and people watching.There’s a mix of handmade goods and typical cheaper items. The place is aimed at Uni students so you can understand the buzz surrounding the area. Some really good cafes in the area if you’re into that scene.
Cheap goods and food,Nice shopping street with cheap goods and food compare to Myeongdong. The street is not so crowded as in Myeongdong and if you intend to get some clothing here's the place.
Tour trip,"Stayed in Hongdae. Hongik Exit 9 is famois for street entertainment, street shopping too. Quite a nice place to explore"
great place to see the young nightlife here.,"very very busy street esp at night and on the weekends. lots of food options, cafes, bars, and casual clubs. you can see students busking and dancing on the streets. hongik university is known for there arts program, so this area is full of culture. i wouldn't suggest this place if you hate crowded streets. hongdae is a popular hangout place among locals, not just a tourist place so its almost always packed. "
Young and Vibrant ,"I chose this area to stay because of its vibrance, and the reviews that Trip Advisor contributors provided. The street performers I saw weren’t that good, but that’s not what attracted me to the area. The presence of a diverse set of food choices and the small pubs made it a good choice. It’s also an easy train hop to many of the local attractions."
Good food and cute shopping ,"This area is perfect for teenagers! Lots of shopping and cute clothes and accessories. Good, quick food everywhere and pet cafes everywhere. "
"Lively, youthful, energetic",The ambiance is youthful. Flea market and street performances packed this place with people and excitement. A picture of energy and freedom
K-pop incubator,"The street is full of fun and performances by budding K-pop interns if you pay a visit during weekends. The exit 9 of the metro station was well packed with people when we went there on a Saturday. Apart from the the shops snd cafes, you can just spend a nice afternoon walking around and get entertained by the various groups of performers. Though crowded, the place is quite orderly. A nice way to understand the K-pop culture and share the fun."
Feeling young in Hongik!,"This area has many shops, restaurants and stalls around. Prices are relatively cheaper than in Myeongdong. At night, there is a part of the street where the youth perform for free. They dance, sing, play instruments. It was very entertaining and the whole place was just so full of energy."
Bustling street with live entertainment ,"I dropped by on a Saturday night and the streets were bustling with wannabe artistes performing side by side with each other. Most of them weren’t good though, haha! But the crowd and music added to the vibrance and bustle of the area. Lots of shops and restaurants in the area so it’s a great place to stroll around and make cool discoveries."
An interesting weekend sight!,"Aside from the young and hip retail stores, the sidewalks comes to live during the weekend (I was there in the early evening) with group performances by young girls and guys... singing, dancing and it was all done at pretty high standards too! Imagine K-pop MV live performance! There is a great creative vibe and lots of energy all round. A great experience. "
Street of Youth,"If you are young or if you want to know how younger Koreans enjoy their life, visit Hongdae.Hongdae refers to a whole area which includes Hongik university. By the way, it is on metro line 2. I have lived nearby for 8 years, and now I am tired of it. However, there is a lot to do, eat and watch. Every day, especially weekend nights, there is a lot of busking. People sing, dance and play instruments then passers-by join and enjoy altogether. How good it is! You can feel the youth in the street. Oh, by the way, if you hate crowds, you may not like it because there are a lot of people:)"
Hongik University Street college vibes!,Hongik University Street has the vibes for youth. It gives us the impression to be in our youthful days. Very recommended street to stroll. :)
Romantic place,A pretty and beautiful place to stroll around. Many unique cafes along the street. A good dating place to go
A very hip place for young adults,"Hongik or known as Hongdae is a very happening place in the evening where wannabe korean artists will have performance on the streets everywhere. There are plenty of restaurants to chose from as well. But shopping is more expensive here vs Ewha University. So if your main objective is to shop for clothings, go to Ewha instead & skip here."
Best walking shopping street ...buskers...fun..students..,local tourist info desk...401 korean restaurant is great food....just city tour bus...on and off.... fun neighborhood..better than dongaonman...etc...
Chicken and BBQ,"This street full of chicken and korean bbq with beer. Good place for dinner. In fact i have been staying here for 8 days and having 3 day dinner here trying different type of food. After dinner, having a short walk and enjoying the street performing is good. But if really really enjoy, then please give some tips."
"Super lively, young energy street, lots of street food","I would rate this as better than Myeongdong, where I have stayed a few times, in that it is less touristy. But it's packed with people and on a Saturday there was lots of amateur entertainment and dancing, a little busker festival was going on."
Street pack with young adults,We came out of the subway exit and found lots of ppl. There r people performing and branded shops r all around d area.There s also an information center there.Very helpful
Eventful and interesting part of Seoul to visit,"Easily accessible by Metro, this street is bustling with shops that caters to the young and trendy. Wide variety of food choices anytime of the day. I went during a weekend and there were many activities happening, which was enjoyable to see."
Best part of Seoul,"This Hongik University Street is my personal best experience of my Seoul trip, at first I am not sure why my wife brought me here, it just a street in my mind, but after we arrive at the metro and walk into this street, the atmosphere is superb, mind blowing and you feel younger for sure...I hope I had come here 10 years younger when I can mingle more with students, but is still great to feel how lively and energetic they areThe performers mostly are singer and dancer, and they do really know what they are doing, all is K-Pop Star like performance.I am not sure this is daily night thing or only weekend because we are there during the Chuseok holiday. The street is full of performers and visitor... and little up there is the shopping street I guess,... is too full of people... so lively...you got to visit here to feel what I am trying to express....Highly recommended for all Seoul visitor to try it out !"
great place,"Full of young people and subculture stuffs.If you are interested in these kind of things,I think you will love here, which is like Si-men-ting in Taiwan.這裡充斥著年輕人以及次文化。如果你對這類的東西很感興趣的話，我想你應該會蠻喜歡這邊的，這邊有點像台灣的西門町。"
Great,Fabulous place...Great value for money...we shall come back whenever in Hongdae...service was superb.n atmosphere lively...TKS a lot
Very fun,Super busy and fun to walk around. We went at night and the place was still super crowded with students. Lots of snacks and shopping 
Good place for shopping and sightseeing the night life.,"It is the place where teens get to relax, meeting, hopping or playing together. Many restaurants, BBQ, desserts and bars open till the midnight or 1AM. (There are a few places open 24hr - at least 1 BBQ restaurant as I've seen) Shoes, sports shirts, beauty stores all you can find here. "
Good vibes,"AMAZING nightlife. Such a nice area with a very artistic and youthful vibe. Plenty of wonderful independent bars, restaurants and boutiques to explore."
My favourite area of Seoul,"Especially on the weekend, this is a very lively place to shop and explore Seoul's youth culture. At night, buskers, generally young adults, come out and set up areas where they sing, play music and dance. The dancers, though, are amazing. The atmosphere is spectacular and there are so many people crowded around these performers and you can just stand there all night, absorbed in the enthusiasm and passion."
A very happening place!,"Hongkik Exit 3: Chill college area with a lot of small winding streets and cafes. Main area has a small green parkway surrounded by bars and shops. Off the main streets are some higher end restos and a ton of hidden shopping and great cafes.Hongkik Exit 9:This is food/shopping galore. If you came to Seoul to buy something, chances are you will find it here. Attractions include TrickEye museum (3d museum), Nanta theatre, some animal cafes (raccoon cafes are a thing here) and all the shopping.Street food is also very nice."
"Buskers, chill, coffees and snacks!",Grab your coffee to go or have a great meal around this Hondae street is best! Then walk around to enjoy the performances of many different buskers from singer to dancing and you can also ger yourself caricatured! Definitely a must visit!
Enjoy The Youth Culture,"Located near Hongik University. This place is a favorite hangout spot for youngsters. Lively, bright, colorful street full of cafes, clubs, restaurants, unique clothing & accessories stores. Shopping, food & accommodation is budget friendly. Underground basement shows, live street band & performances. Best place to enjoy Seoul youth culture. * Clubs are packed on Saturday night and have entry fee 10,000 won & above.* Must visit Hongdae Free & Hope market (March to Nov every Saturday 1pm - 6pm)"
Definite ,Great place for cheap eats and fun shopping. Busy at night with Street entertainers. Not necessarily good but interesting. Lots to choose from. 
Nice and fun!,"Good place to hung around... bice restaurants, shops, people, views, presents, clothes, old style and traditional... everything for a nice sunday afternoon "
Lots going on on a Saturday night,"This was a very fun pedestrian street walking seen with lots to see and do. The amount of performers packed in tightly was surprising and the amount of support most got was great to see. There is a large swath of different kinds of restaurants, bars and cafés to choose from as well as little shops to scope out. The variety of the things to see on a Saturday night will keep you entertained for hours"
Area to walk,This is a place where you can enjoy walking because there are many shops and also you can enjoy watching performances from amateurs to professional artists!♥
Great place for clothes shopping and cute cafes,Clothes are half the price of regular stores. Many interesting cafes with beautiful decor. Make sure to visit Line Friends flagship store!
Shopping & Nightclub district,Great place to enjoy street performance from young generation who's love on K-POP dacing. This place is one of the best shopping district in Seoul. Also In the night time you also can enjoy with many nightclub that located on this area. 
Excellent ,Alot of shops there. Highly recommended for all to go. Prepare your cash. Shop till you drop there. Nice
nice lively place especially at night,"Since there is a university located this is obviously a place for young crowd. Lot of discounted shops but with an intension of selling stuff which students require such as mobile covers, stationery, bags, purses, t shirts, tops, etc Many restaurants and bars also."
Free live music and dance,"The food here is relatively cheaper compared to other touristy areas. The are rows of clothing shops to choose from. Once light falls, the area is crowded with street performers and you will find boy-bands, girl-bands, soloist, dancers etc taking up every space they can find to perform. Good experience."
GREAT!,"My husband and I enjoy street performances very much. Personally Im not a fan of Kpop, but it was impossible for someone to not enjoy the street performances here. This is the most happening street that I've ever been to in Seoul and Jeju."
Lively place,"Visited on a Sunday and it was really vibrant and lively. Lots of teenagers, a lot of restaurants, cafes, shopping as well. There is the hongdae hope Market and lots of stalls set up and you can shop till you drop. There is also theme cafes like bunny cafe, dogs cafe. Previously I watched the Nanta show in Hongdae as well. Overall, I really like this place a lot. "
Adore this place,"One of my favorite places to visit, it is buzzing and vibrant with life. Go on weekend especially where young students and artists busk and perform on the streets. All the shops are here too, buy everything from fiery korean instant ramen to delectable cookies to masks"
Not too baf,"Went to hongik to check out the street performances, there were a lot of students dancing and singing. Not too bad except that the street was quite narrow so it’s hard to check out the performances when it is very crowded "
Hongik University Street Seoul Korea,This is a lovely area to stroll along as there are many fashion shops and street food catering to the university students...
For the younger crowd ,"Fun with a bunch of friends, lotsa food and beverage outlets catering to younger crowd. Even spa as Korean love their relaxing soak. Night time is preferred time to go "

Vibrant,"Vibrant atmosphere that you can feel at evenings till night lot of street art, music and dance also street parties"
More Lively At Night Than Anywhere Else,"We found that the Hongik University area had more going on and was packed with more people late at night than ANY other area in Seoul. It was disappointing to find that the popular markets such as Namdaemun pretty much closed up after 7pm on weeknights, but the shops and restaurants in Hongik were packed and fun well past 11pm, even on a Tuesday! If you’re looking to grab some food and explore the city in the evenings and it’s mid-week, definitely visit Hongik University instead of the other markets. I wish we had discovered this sooner. "
Great Area,I would recommend for anyone looking for the best in Seoul shopping and young life entertainment. I have learned a lot about the mellinials here. Go for the experience if nothing else.
Young vibe,The whole street has a very young feel about it. This is definitely a place to visit just to soak in the young energy! 
Place for the youth,A very interesting place when there is a lot of students including students from overseas. Many street performers and F&B outlets.
Crowded fun,"We went here in late afternoon into the night primarily to shop, eat and drink. We had coffee and snacks in a cafe, spent considerable time shopping that the sun went down. Night time brought crowds more of people but the mood was fun due to the street performers. We ended the night with korean BBQ and soju right off the Hongik University Street. We really enjoyed our time here because the goods, food, and drinks were cheaper than Myeongdong area. (There was a big cute statue of a bunny rabbit holding a telescope outside Exit 1 or 2 of Hongik Station which was good for photo ops.)"
Nice fashion,I love this street so much. You will feel young. Got so many shops. Many cafes. You can what is in trend by walking at the street. During the weekends its pack of people.
Crowded but great,I suggest if you are staying in the area to take a walk in the morning to get a feel for the layout and what stores are there. In the evening it gets very crowded and harder to navigate. We enjoyed the buskers.
Best hangout place for youths,"Kinda regretting that we didn't spend longer time here. Make sure to visit during weekend, especially Saturday as you can spot many busking activities. The places to eat, shops and strolls are in abundance. The place is near a campus (Hongik University, hence, the name) so expect lively and vibrant place where you can encounter young people everywhere."
Home for the youngsters,"If you enjoy street art scenery, then this spot is for you! Hongik University (Hongdae) area is full of it from day to night. There's always a performance that you can see, from singing, dancing or even magic. And to make it even better, this location is packed with cosmetic stores, clothing stores, restaurants as well as street food stalls. The crowd is mainly youngsters and you will see many foreigners here too. So pay a visit to this place when you're in town!"
I loved it ,"I visited this street so many times. Travel via the metro to get to the street. So much offers of food, clothes, drinks and the prices are competitive. Pop Entertainment on a weekend is the best. Massive crowds however it's safe and the market is still active way after dark! "
"Young, wild and free","Hongik University street or simply ""Hongdae"" is becoming quite popular among both tourists and locals. It is definitely a ""must see"" when visiting Seoul. Some perform famous song covers sitting on a bench while the others try to copy dance moves from famous K-Pop videos. When young and talented people of Seoul want to express themselves and demonstrate their abilities Hongdae is the place to go. But not only that. When the night comes Hongik University Street turns into one of the most attractive party places in Korean capital. Bars, clubs, food stalls, expats and locals drinking and chatting at the playground - incredible vibe. Want to get to know about modern Korean culture, get inspired and make new friends from all over the world? Hongdae is your place then! "
"Cool and quirky, comes alive at night","Lots of great shopping at cheap prices, very quirky and fun especially for teenagers/student ages, but can also be enjoyed by others too. Awakens at night time with street performers, vendors, clubs and bars etc. Loads of food options, not all cheap but plenty of happy hour deals on or lunch offers. Some bars charge entry at weekends after 10.30, most places have free WiFi. "
Lively!,"Starting around 10am shops start to open with a variety of wares, lots of clothing here - though you'll also find the obligatory beauty shops here. Towards the evening food stalls and street performers will come out - for me this was the best part of Hongdae. There are plenty of bars and clubs on the southside, and smaller boutique restaurants in the northern alleys. Overall it has a quirky, young feel that you don't find elsewhere in Seoul."
"Bars, cafes, crowded fun neighborhood!!!","We are traveling around Korea in summer and staying at this street. The street is crowded with young people sitting on the grass and having drinks and picnics every night! It's fun, beautiful people, nice bars and restaurants, very pleasant and hipster area to be in!"
I love,Go for it u will enjoy .. i love to live herThe accommodation is so comfortable.. and the shopping is so excited .. 
Vibrant Night Life,"One of the must visit places in Seoul to experience the night life. Due to the close proximity to Hongik University, the place is teeming with teenagers and has a very vibrant atmosphere; choices for street food are abundant."
cozy place,"a good place to know about korean life. Lots of street food, a bit pricey but worth to try. Street shop also interesting."
Many street performance available,"During weekend, friday nigh to sunday, we can see many street performance here, such as dance cover, singing, etc. it's good place to hangout for who love the crowd. "
Youthful place,There were many shops there selling things ranging from bags to tshirts to food. We went on a saturday when there were many street performances. Cafes are available for chilling.
Lively place ,Went on a winter afternoon. Super cold but the streets was filled with crowds. Good for teenager to visit. 
Amazing place,"For first timers in Korea, I would suggest staying in this time because you get a feel of the Korean culture, their lifestyle, their food and their fashion. The place is lined with restaurants, shops selling clothes plus a number of specialty stores such as Line shop, Kakao shop to name a few. The place is also near proximity to places such as Gyeongui book street with speciality book cafes or to Yeon Nam dong. All within walking distance."
Cool place to wander around,Load of restaurants and street vendors for food and selling stuff. This place is so great for shopping especially clothes. Open around 6pm to midnight and very convenient as it's not too far from underground.
"Shopping, food and pubs","Great area to spend the day shopping and eating. Items are priced for the student market it serves. Seems like many students part-time in these boutique shops around the area. Most can speak some sprinkling of English, Chinese and even Japanese."
Lively street,"The average age of this street must be around 20 or less. The streets are full of shops selling everything youths go for / hang out - fashion, accessories, cafes, restaurants, etc. There are also spots where some of the youths are performing anything from singing to dancing to juggling - you can find these where the crowds are gathering. "
Place for the young,"It comprises of a few streets near the entrance of the university and you can find a variety of food, beverages and clothing for sale. I was expecting fashionable street wear to be available since this is a spot for youngsters but the clothes sold are generally too ordinary."
Beer!!!,"great food place. found lots of food and bars, so this will be awesome for avid beer drinkers out there"
"A vibrant, fun area to visit","While catering to the young (it is the university district!), it was very fun to visit. Street vendors, shopping, entertainment - worth seeing."
"Modern and trendy street,","Nice to stroll, see people perform on the street (singers) get a coffee or look at the shops, Raccoon cafe."
"Vibrant, safe and interesting","As in all of South Korea I felt safe and secure exploring this area with my English teacher son and his friends. Overpriced, sure, but it is a tourist area. Duck away from the main streets and explore the side alleys, underground restaurants, or above street level cafes. Or sit at the tables outside a convenience store with a drink and watch the world rush by."
Nice street and lovely ambience,"If you have time during your travel to Seoul, must drop by to visit this street. It is very happening and lively. Good place to chill, shopping and during Saturday there are street perfomance."
Super favorite hangout spot!,"I was in Seoul for two weeks, and came here three times because one is not enough. It's the best place to hangout for the young, shops are open until very late, lots of izakayas, restaurants, and hip cafes around, even some animal cafes. On Sunday, they have free market. It'll be super busy, but worth to check out. Also, you will probably meet your favorite idol here."
Can spend days here,"This whole area contains some of the best things in Seoul. Tons of dog, cat, rabbit, and even MEERCAT cafes. At night there is always different street performers (dancers, singers, etc) gathered throughout the streets. I’ve spent days here just exploring and still haven’t seen even close to everything. Monster Pizza and Gusto Taco are the best places to eat here. Great for vegetarians and everyone.Also has a bumping clubbing scene. Would DEFINITELY recommend a night of Korean clubbing, followed by some night karaoke.Great for all ages."
Entertainment street,"The street is a good place to shop, get your food and entertainment also can be seen, and it is also crowded and pack with youngsters. Overall a great place to visit."
Quirky and studenty,This area has the most interesting small shops where you can buy a very random collection of items. The place feels alive and very different to the rest of the city whatever the time of day.
Packed with youngsters!,"If there are really good buskers and you came late, you won't get to squeeze your way in to see the performers lol there are good restos around and other shops that are worth a visit as well. Friday night is fun too lol You'll see a lot of drunk girls dragged by their friends or boyfriends. Not a good sight, but it's their culture. This place is worth a visit. :)"
Shopping street,"Cheaper stuff, but still, tourists always get expensive price lol!Me and my 13 yr old daughter enjoyed the place. We watched the street amateur performers, left and right from afternoon til night.Lots of shops around, tattoo and piercing shops, coffee shops, restaurants, ice cream shops, foodstalls, convenience store and english speaking tourist information. There’s also a police station in the middle.Really nice place to stroll around with teenagers. Don’t forget to take a look of noraebangs and watch those funny teens dancing and singing lol"
Always Live!!,"The streets and the area is always crowded.. but you can find a lot of fun there.. also you can find a good food. (i found a turkish restaurant there also :) ).. and if you like to drink something with your friends you can find any type of bar, pub, club there.. "
You can feel the energy in the Air! ,"A great place to stroll for shopping, food and entertainment. Street performers are everywhere! You will never be bored! Youthful, creative & fashion-forward crowd. Filled with vibrant energy! A must visit on Fridays! "
Artistic Part of Seoul,"Did remind of Australia where street artist performed their talent along the alley. Best to visit during night. A lot of Korean teenagers filled the street to watch the artist, or just hanging around to eat and did shopping. Located quite far from the Seoul city center (around 30 mins by subway), I needed to clear my schedule to visit Hongik Univ Street.Very recommended."
Lively Street,This street lively all the time! You can find a lot of shopping place in there. And also this street full of art performans. Oh by the way you must to find Waffle House and try their waffle number 6! Hmmmmmmmm Yum yummmmmmm!
"Late Night walk, Super fun.","A lot of Food, talent performers, shops.It is crowded and lively at night. Restaurants are open until very late in the night. There are performance on the street at night. The youngsters present themselves in various forms."
Endless Entertainment,"This area is the best. You never run out of things to do. The more time you spend here, the more interesting places you find. It's definitely worth taking time to explore."
See the life of local youngers,"This place is truely lively. Overwhelmed by Korean youngers. Extremely busy on weekend’s nights. Full of good restaurants, shops, and street performances. Recommended if you want to feel the real teenages’ vibe in Seoul. "
Very lively place,Filled with shopping streets and food streets. Koreans singing and performing along the streets as well. Filled with youngsters. 
A busy places with a lot to see,"With all the shops you can name and the malls locating around this area, this is a good place to shop with metro station just nearby. Stuff are a little more expensive than the one you can get at namdaemun and myeongdong though."
Shopping..Mural art,"Located in front of Hongik University, it is a center for children and teenagers. It is a romantic atmosphere ... interesting performances and festivals. In addition to the walls around the campus, Hongyi also has a street art. Many paintings on the wall. This is another attraction of this district."
A Vibrant Place for Youngster,"You can literally feel the young vibe in this place. If you are visiting on the weekend just be prepared it will be so much crowd with more street performance. Hongdae is one of the hip place for youngster so if you don't really enjoy crowd and noisiness,please don't come to this area! As you get out at exit 9 at Hongik Univ station, you can just follow the crowd to the street with a lot of street performance from singing to dancing which usually more popular with k-pop dancing. Along the street you can find a lot of restaurants and small shops as well. "
Authentic atmosphere of korean young people culture,"Nice clubbing area, moreover streets with food and exotic shops are cool to walk around. By the way we bumped into Trickeye Museum, which is sort of extraordinary Augmented Reality museum! Overall the experience was delightful :)"
Best place for hanging out at night,"This area is just awesome. If you want to hang out at the evening, you just need to go there. You will find everything you want and even more. It is very crowded at the weekends. When you walk around you will see a lot of different artists and musicians and you can enjoy different street food."
Hip clothes and bars,"If your looking for hip clothes, this is the place. Also had a lot of bars and clubs that are open late at night."
Vitality area,"I ve been seoul twice, compared to myeongdong here is much more fun n easy to see some new stuff. if u want buy trendy but not expensive things. On weekend many young ppl will perform on the street , can feel the energy from this area."
Cool!! ,"A great spot to spend an afternoon. You can enjoy everything from shopping, spending hours long in cafeterias, watching KPOP-dancers on the streets and just watching talented people do their thing. Highly recommendable! "
Tourists of different nationalities are flooding the street and a Tourist,"This place is located at Hongdae, and very accessible via Seoul’s subway through Hongik University Station. Just follow the arrows overhead, and it should tell you which exit to take. Hongik University area appeared to be one of the most popular sites to visit when in Seoul. Tourists of different nationalities are flooding the street and a Tourist Information Desk/Assistance is even readily available to assist. A lot of the shops and stores were already opened as early as noon time, while few were still closed. You may want to bring an extra shopping bag, since a lot of items for sale are very affordable."
Vacation,Went to this area to go to the trick eye museum and was pleasantly surprised with the little shops along the way. Could not resist shopping. This is a place to visit. 
AMAZINGLY ALIVE!!,Every imaginable store is around this area. Also there is an alley filled with some marvelous graffiti and art called Mural Alley. 
A Street that Comes Alive,"The young people of the country makes the street very lively and it showcases the current Korean pop culture. There were students performing live, singing K-Pop songs and groups of female students dancing to the tune of K-Pop songs. Watching them perform are other students and passer-by; cheering and dancing along. I think the street was filled with more performers as the night get darker.Besides performances, the street is home to many stalls and shops selling cheap accessories. Further up the street, there were also stalls selling snacks and food.We also find that the street had some cheap food, most probably due to its close proximity to the student population.Recommend a visit to experience the pop culture through the students' lifestyle."
Come during the weekends ,"It's more lively during the weekends where street art performers come to perform , watch the young Korean singing , street dancing , other than that it's full with lots of restaurant here even halal one like kebabs . "
the university itself is not a touristy place,"I was expecting Hongik as the same level as Ehwa University but this place is like the usual school and nothing special to see there. Yes there are shops and restos around the area but you can buy those in Ehwa, Myeongdong and other places as well. Not worth the visit. Did not meet my expectation."
Lively Road with Food and Street Performances,"Hongik Night life alone makes this location worth checking out, but atop that there are food spots open late (Kebab, egg bread, Turkish Kebabs). Lastly, you can usually see plenty of street performances from aspiring singers, dance teams, even magicians. I genuinely miss this aspect of Seoul and I recommend you don't pass it up."
Great Enjoyment in Seoul.,"If your for looking for great places to eat, shopping that is geared to college level students and raw street entertainment for people looking to be discovered in the KPOP world, this is the place to go, Very easy to reach on the subway and has a ""taco bell"" which is nice to eat at sometimes."
Fun Crowded student area,"Arrived there at 7 pm, this place was packed. So many young people ! So refreshing haha !Full of restaurant everywhere, bars, dancers on the street.You absolutely need to stop by one evening."
Hongdae,"In Hongik University Street you can find a lot of shops and restaurants and ""street fods"" . I liked mostly the Haitairo restaurant where you can find yummy cips.W Hongik jest mnóstwo sklepów i restauracji. Najbardziej polecam restaurację Haitairo, w której można znaleść wiele pyszności."
A constant street fair,"From all the shopping to the restaurants to the novelty coffee houses (cats and bunnies and dogs, oh my!) this entire area has something for everyone. Like video games? They've got then. Fancy food? It's there. There are street performers and carnival games. And entire stores devoted to crane/claw machines. Overall, an experience you shouldn't miss in Seouls."
Fun,"AKA Hongdae. Always busy, fun, and full of young people, shops and restaurants. Trendy and cool. Nightclubs nearby too."
I stayed for a week,This area is straight up epic. The airport train comes here directly so that was a major bonus for me. Overwhelming number of things to do here and food hunts here are not very wallet friendly. For nights of fun no matter the day of the week Hongdae will keep you imensely entertained. 
Favorit Street in Korea,"this is my favorit pedestrian in Korea.. always filled with young people and very lively... every night, there will always someone who perform on the street, and it was really entertaining.. also there is a nice bibimbap restaurant and BBQ restaurant which was reccomended by chef Gordon Ramsay.. i would love to go back here"
Good for shopping and street food.,"We find clothes here are cheaper and more suitable to teenage girls. We also visit Sobok, ice cream from grain, it's so yummy!"
Lively on a Saturday night ,We were there on a Saturday night and it was quite packed. People were performing in the streets and it was a very nice place to find a good bar.
Rubbish..,Maybe it was because its a cold winters night.. but the food was just normal shops.. as for the street 'entertainers' there was 2 youngsters singing in the street... I have seen more effort from a busker outside a London subway exit..
Korean most trendy place,"A place where young people would like to visit . When you leave from exit no 9 of Hongik University mtr, especially in weekend, there are a lot of hawkers selling goods and food. You can see a lot of young boys and girls dancing in the street like K-pop groups. Sometimes there are arts students selling their paintings and handmade accessories. This is a great place you must visit if you want to know more about Korean culture."
Nice place!,"I stayed in Hongdae area when i was in Korea. Cozy place, meet so many students here. Easy to get. You'll love it!"
Always lively place,"A lot of people coming here/ Especially at Friday's night and I know why! Cheap and tasty street food, many talented guys and girls singning or dancing - that a perfext combination for the evening :) Also, many small shops open very late. I love to stay at this area next time"
Good place but not on every weekends,"I have been there for several weekends, there is a really great place to walk at night and enjoy the street singers and the environment of youth excites and many bars, clubs and lunges; but there is a thing to consider: Do not go there on the last weekend of the month! Usually, the last Friday and weekend of the month is one of the especial dates for youth to enjoy, then this street gets more crowded, noisy and dirty! Just avoid this time to go, otherwise, the street is really fantastic!"
Hongik University Street,"Went there for dinner with a friend, this place is so lively and there are so many things to see. A lot of youngsters at this place, you will see people performing/singing/dancing. It is next to the metro station so it is very convenient to get there"
Join the young people,"Experience it best at night. Buy your beer from a take-out counter and sit around the mini park with performing artists for free. Watch dog owners walk their dogs around. Or eat at one of the restaurants overlooking the park. Good food, friendly waiters. Bars, coffee shops, convenient stores are available."
College town culture,"Because it's so close to Hongik University, this area is crawling with college students. There are fashion, cosmetics, and tech shops all around, along with different bars and restaurants. Street performers abound, with people singing, dancing, doing magic tricks, etc. The weekends can get pretty crowded, especially at night. If you'd like to immerse yourself in youthful, energetic culture, Hongdae is for you."
"Energetic, Must visit","The street is located not too far from the bustling Hongik Univ. Station and offers a wide selection of fashion shops, restaurants, and other stalls. Quiet is word unknown to the visitors of this street. Wherever you look you will see and hear many Koreans busking to different well-known Korean songs, and even their own! The place gives out a very welcoming, alive and enjoyable vibe to be a part of. For shoppers who want to find trendy, affordable clothing, this area should be on your list. For enjoying a nice day/night, this street offers an inviting vibe which makes you not want to leave! Great place, would come again next time I'm in Seoul.*Tips*-If you are travelling here with others at night, it can get very crowded, so keep your group/family close to you-If this area doesn't offer the wide array of shops you might be looking for, you can see Myeongdong which is quite similar, yet with more shops-If you want to go when it's a little emptier, check Hongdae out before sunset:)"
A vibrant and youthful street,We went on a Saturday early afternoon and the place had buskers and flea markets and lots and lots of youth. Very vibrant.
Nice place!,"Just like Myeong-Dong but minus the crowd and wide array of shops. I wasn't able to get free masks here unlike in Myeong-Dong but the place is so nice! It's usually full of students and young couples. Here you can find LOHB or Love, Health and Beauty, a store you can't find in Myeong-Dong. "
A very fashionable street with positive vibes!,"Full of teenagers performing K-POP dance along the streets. A very happening place with fashion, restaurants & cafes!"
Great atmosphere with loads of bars and restaurants,"We chose to stay in the Hongik area and so the streets around us became the go to place for meals, drinks, supermarkets etc. Also, close to main MTR lines"
Great place to find dinner,When you are in Korea for a few weeks you kind of give up on kimchi hahahaha. So it is good to know you have more options and this street is nicest to walk and explore new restaurant and stores. 
Best Street in Seoul,"This is with no doubt the best street in Seoul and I want to stay there when I come next time.The activities there are just amazing, people play music, sing, draw, talk and talk and talk, actually, this is the only street in Seoul where young Korean people introduced themselves and had conversations with me."
Hongdae street,"The most famous street near hongdae university. Cheap, trendy, all you need fashion item. The busy street to come, sightseeing, eating and shopping and take a picture with friends."
A vibrant shoppers’ paradise ,"This street leads you to all kinds of alleyways that offer a variety of clothes, shoes, accessories and cafes. Hongik seems to be an oasis for foodies who love hunting for that sumptuous fare or simply relaxing over coffee and cake. At night, the streets throb with Kpop Star wannabes who belt out songs with gusto. I personally prefer it to Myeongdong as it has a good blend of dining options, street snacks and clothes n accessories stores. There is a huge Bershka there. The biggest i have ever seen."
Kpop extravaganza for free,"Went on Sunday night. Snow flakes falling. Young people dancing. Not just dancing, but Kpop style the kind that makes your body subconsciously while watching. It is that addictive and these people ARE good. You see (sometimes) the coach by the side or by the corner teaching the steps and polishing their moves. A must see ! Also loads of restaurants here. Very crowded on weekends."
Friends ,It is small street full of shops and restaurants. I heard there are some clubs but I haven’t been there so far. But it is sure that area is full of energy from youngsters.
"Cover Dance, Song and Many teenager","This here have many activity (Cover Dance, Song) at Main street on Thursday until Sunday. So many teenager at here and a good night life"
Myeongdong lite,"A trendy part of Seoul, which I would describe as ""Myeongdong lite"" because you can't really differentiate the merchandise or the food being sold there and those at Myeongdong. The area is a lot smaller though and not as insanely crowded, hence the ""lite"" description. One thing is unique though, and thats live performances. A lot of new young talent showcasing themselves to the public."
Day & Night hangout space ,"Hongik or Hongdae never sleeps. You can shop and hangout here day & night! There are lots of shops, restaurants and clubs to explore. You will never get bored spending times here!!! "
One of my favourite parts of Seoul,"Great place for shopping and relaxing at cafes or bars. Younger area of Seoul but affordable fashion, awesome street performances and trendy shops. Would recommend!"
Great place to relax,It is a great place to relax and enjoy nightlife of Korea.Been with friends several for nightouts .Enjoy in best Pubs of Hongdae.
Great place for shopping especially for youngster,"This is like Bugis shopping street in Singapore. Alot of trendy things here, especially the clothing and bags. Prices are reasonable. More suitable for youngsters as the things here are pretty trendy. Street foods are available."
Artsy and cool,Vibrant university area with many buskers singing and dancing. Lots of shops and the coolest was called the MAKEUP PUB...go here for the swankiest makeup store ever!
Nice Modern Area,"This is where you can get the latest trends in music, bars and food. Musicians busk in the area (though they can really do away with loudspeakers), new ideas and cafes, and new beer pubs."
Youthful,"At night, this is an open stage for local students and some foreigners to show off their talent. A long walking street full of beauty shops, coffee, branded clothing, school supplies. Don't missed those theme cafes especially Blute."
Hype place for young people,"I stay here one whole week for my korea trip, this place is very convenient, lots of restaurants, cafe etc.. the best part is whenever i book my one day tour, usually they will ask you to wait at hongik university station exit 4, so is super convenient and save my subway trip money as well!! "
Lively and trendy area,Lots of young people hang out here especially at night where the place will come alive with music and foods and dances. Can find reasonably priced clothing around this area as it mainly caters to the young crowd. It gets very crowded at night.
ok,"youngsters busking and dancing, showing their talents. lively area to visit. free market available on saturdays but there werent that many stalls set up. beautiful hand-made crafts though"
Recommended spot to hangout!,"Situated near the university, this place is a great place to visit day and night. Lots of shops and restaurants, and lots of musicians play there.Very lively and crowded."
Lively neighborhood,"This is a lively neighborhood with lots of shops and restaurants frequented by millenials. Cheap, fashionable clothing are sold around the area and at nighttime, the bars light up and the young adults become wild."
lively street scene at night,"reasonably easy to get to via railway, near central Seoul. Lots of neon, younger generation out at night. Plenty of food options. Felt very safe. Lots of 'retail therapy' available ranging from street stalls to high end retail"
Life and energy in Hongdae,"A place where young people ( Students, young couples, tourists) loves to hang out. Lots of shops selling fashion items and many eateries. Street performances attract screaming young fans and curious tourists... worth a visit"
Not for family with Kids,It's a very lively place. Great for young adult and teenagers. Too crowded. Not for family with young kids.
funny point,"It is the most trendy place in Korea. On weekends, performances by unknown singers are often held. You can enjoy the main street by subway station exit 9."
"Great place for cheap eats, street performances and cheap Korean fashion","You can always feel the energy and liveliness of this area. Bustling with students and young people, the area has catered to its mostly younger clientele with cheap eats yet delicious restaurants and stores selling items with prices aimed at students. You won't find items cheaper anywhere else: clothes, accessories, etc.It's like a Myeongdong for the youth who don't want to be ripped off.The area has also many cafes and a lot of teenage girls gathering around to see guys performing live.Everyone is bound to have a great time here!"
"Shop, eat and drink",Great place where got everything. From shopping in the daytime until bar and clubs at night time. Nice cafes ans boutiques!
 Check this out at night,"Fun area. Mostly local youth going around at night into the different shops, restaurants and bars. Worth checking out - be prepared for large crowds! "
Hongik University Street,"Lots of fun and young people all around, street food, shows, art, music and activities everywhere. A must-visit place especially for night life lovers."
Stayed in this area for a month,"Hongik Uni and the hole area is really cool!!! You see only young people, street food, music n art. Cool place to get inspired"
Better after renewal.,Clean and convenient place after renewal. You can easily see a good performance. You can socialize with others.
Lots of food and shopping choices,"The area is full of restaurants, street food and various stores for happy shoppers. It is quite nice to immerse in the youth vibe and during night time, there might be some performances on the street. I walked quite far away from the crowds to this quaint area which has a number of cafes. Would have went in for a drink if I wasn't full from my earlier meal... There is also a cute stationary store which sells stuff at cheap prices, such as notebooks, pens, envelops etc."
Fun day and night activity! ,"If you’re in the mood to shop, grab a coffee, visit a cafe, drink with friends, then this place is for you! Easy to get around and find something to do. The hongdae Park has a flea market each Saturday. "
Great Place for Food and Shopping,Very international environment with places like Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory and Taco Bell. There are even more exotic cafes where you can pay to play with exotic animals like meercats or racoons. Very interesting experience. I especially liked the Jjimdak chicken and cheese dish across the street from Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory.
Overrated section of Seoul,"The ""hip"" part of Seoul is anything but. It has some pricier versions of the street food I love so much in the city. The night clubs are not worth the effort. You're better off finding one of the numerous other Korean drinking areas. "
Young and Vibrant environment,Lots of street performances. Come there to feel young and hip! No lack of food and great place to be in.
Over rated,More restaurants than shops and they are mainly for ladies. Quite disappointed that I couldn’t get anything for my son.
Younger shopping street , this shopping street has a lot of bargains to be found and a lot of people and energy. Located at Hongik university station. Walk around and soak it up. So so many shops and stalls and coffee shops and restaurants. I enjoyed it here very much 
My fav market in seoul,Things here are cheaper and more locals come here than foreignersFood stalls and fashion stalls everywhere
Shopping Bargains and Entertainment in One Place,"Visited this on a saturday because that's the only day where there's a free market. Everywhere you go you'll see tons of people selling either clothes and accessories or people showing off their craft whether it's singing, dancing or drawing.I had a blast playing darts though on a stall. It was for 8000 krw and you get 8 darts. I hit all 8 and I won a blue devil plushie. So stoked because I didn't even know I was good at darts. So I recommend heading down Hongdae during Saturdays for the fun and entertainment. "
대학촌,"It is a place where Hong University students pass through as a famous spot. It is a place where young people and a place for nightlife are formed. It is also a place where foreigners visit a lot, but it is also a decadent place.유명한곳이라고 해서 찾아온 장소 홍대학생들이지나다니는거리로서 젊은이들에 마남에장소 밤문화가 형성된곳이다 외국인들이 많이찾는곳이기도하다 하지만 퇴폐스러운곳이기도하다"
"Vibrant University Area: shop, dine & expect the unexpected!","I absolutely love staying in this area and try to do so every time I am in Seoul. You'll find shopping, street food & other delights in the area from around lunch time, in the day. But being situated in a university area, this street REALLY pulses with life, at night!After-dark, you can shop, dine in restaurants, or find trendy street treats until the wee hours, plus all manner of bars and nightclubs. There are also nearby spots catering to a variety of buskers, which seem a VERY popular attraction in nice weather.The streets and shops are alive with the local youth culture and tourists alike. Very crowded on the weekends, but like other parts of Seoul, quite safe to be out at any hour. Well worth experiencing once... or enjoying the area for an extended stay, if it appeals to you."
Good shopping street,"Local shopping street near school and university. Cheap things that you can buy. You can see the Korean fasion here. Everybody is in the same style; bright faces, red lips and see-through fringes."
Fun to stroll around,"Great area, with lots of stuff to see, eat and do. Loads of future K-pop, b-boys and Bbongjjak superstars are practicing on the street, including the obligatory screaming teenage girls."
Beautiful University setting,"We stayed on this street in a small apartment upstairs from the Hongik University metro station. It is a busy, but fun university setting, not unlike most US university towns. Lots of college students out at all hours, lots of restaurants and bars."
must visit! ,"the place has a great vibe, young and refreshing. There's a few street artists performing at that time we were there. Also, the clothes there are cheaper than other parts of seoul probably because it's a university area. "
The place to be!,"Surrounded by the universities within the area, this place is filled with great eateries. There are many interesting cafes along the way. If you are lucky, are able to see the young generation showcasing their talents on the street. "
Vibrant and alive,"Anytime you hit Seoul you need to be here to experience the vibrant, street performance and food. Plenty of restaurants, bars, and shops. Enjoy a good cuppa from any balcony cafes or bar to watch the street performance"
Lively youth street ,"Very exciting,especially during the weekends. The street is quite large and there are things to do there for all times of the day. Cafes are dotted around including some animal ones like meerkat cafes. There are some multi storey arcades as well and hidden noraembangs (karoke) . Lots of good food options around although they aren't really cheap. Nightlife here is bizarre. Other than bars and clubs there always are skilled buskers performing in the evenings. Atmosphere is really great at night. Went there 3 times in a row and am still not tired of it. If you love nightlife, get an accommodation in, or near hongdae."
"Many cheap shops, street food, busking","If you want to have a good taste of Seoul in one day this has got to be it. Shopping, cafes, bars, street food, busking all in one area.It will get crowded even on a weekday. But really all the good food is here!! Check out Yellow Chicken in Hongdae area if you can. It has the best chimaek (chicken + beer) around town."
Floral cafe,"One of the popular floral cafes in Seoul. Some pops and decorations you can wear and wear for selfies. All drinks look very romantic and rosy. This place is pretty small but cozy. There are friendly visitors' guides dressed in red-T on main streets, normally near major subway exits to show you maps and directions."
hippie street,"crowded street full with youngster. It is heaven for shopper, the price is more cheaper compare to myeongdong street. Most of the restaurant full after 6pm. Lot of performance started in the evening. It is the best place to hang around."
Don't go too early!,"9 0'clock on a Friday evening and young people are out in droves, and the majority are not the usual hungover kids. They're singing, drumming, dancing, performing. The energy is incredible and it gives you a sense of why everyone says the edges of fashion, music and culture are really being pushed here in Korea."
Went back 5 times!,"Went on a trip with my friend and had a whole itinerary planned out but we were so in love with Hongdae we returned 5 times in our trip! So many shops to see, nice stalls to visit, adorable cafes, musicians on the street etc... a must see!"
For Younger Generation's Place - 屬於年輕人去的地方,"This is the place for younger generation. You can find dancing teams and singers performing beside the street & they are students. You will find many shops selling cheaper goods for the fact most people in this area are younger. Surely some shops are still in good quality & suitable for hangout for a while. In comparison with other area in Seoul, the varieties are not here.這是個屬於年輕人的地區，可以看到跳舞團體或是獨唱者在路邊表演，多數為學生，大多的店賣比較便宜的東西，因為顧客多為學生或是年輕人，還是有些店家的東西還不錯可以來逛一逛；跟其他首爾區域比起來還是單薄了點。"
average visit,"alight at Hongik University Station. its very convenient. it is quite similar to the myeongdong street, to me at least. heaven for the ladies definitely!!"
"A tourist-friendly, bustling university town","We had an enjoyable morning taking in the sights and vibrancy of the area. You get free wifi even in the streets, so I was able to send real-time photos to my colleagues in Singapore."
Young people haven,"The street is crowded from afternoon to midnight at the weekend we visited. The place is filled with music, smell and young people. Cosmetic shops and eateries were on both sides of the busking area where young people dance, drum, sing and rap. It's a great place to go if you are a kpop enthusiast as the street is filled with wannabes showing off their talents. Some buskers were more entertaining than others. After performances, you can take photos with the buskers or even a light chat. Opposite the busking area, are streets that sell clothes, shoes, accessories and food stalls. I bought a few nice Korean tops there and ate beef skewers, spicy chicken with rice cake, ice cream there. The whole place is vibrant, interesting and fun."
shopping!,"Other than the countless cafes, it is also a good place for cheap(er) and fashionable korean-style shopping. There are street performances to watch too while shopping. There's also a Ryan cafe / Kakao and Friends store located between exit 8 and 9 of Honggik station. It's so happening here!"
Wild and crowded BUT nice!,"I've been here several times and I think it's a place for youngsters! Cause there's clubs, especially when there's these two clubs that were opened by YG, which is one of the famous entertainment company in South Korea, named NB1 and NB2. Also, there's shopping districts where you can shop for trendy clothes at affordable prices. If you've watched South Korea's variety shows, you'll know about tarot reading, which is quite popular among Koreans. There's tarot reading shops everywhere in Hongik University Street. Must try food: Cheese pork ribs! :)"
Experience Kpop singing and dancing performances,"There were lots of shops for cosmetics, apparels and food as expected when one is in Seoul but there were more to it here! Come during night time and you get to watch youngsters dancing, singing kpop songs and many other performances. Some of the must try foods are the barbecue meats on hot stones(where the smoke doesn't leave a smell on you when u leave the place and the meats don't get burnt! The shop is just opposite CU mart), fried chicken with beers, chicken galibi with cheese and many cafeterias which operate till late nights!"
"Amazing destination for entertainment, shopping and for just chilling around","I went in the winter holidays, so unfortunately I did not see much busking or sorts (I am certain there are lots of singers and dancers busking on the streets when the weather becomes hotter though) but the atmosphere was still very vibrant nonetheless and busy and there were so many stores I did not know which to go to first! Here there are bigger stores like Nike, Adidas, Mcm and also smaller clothing stores, cosmetic stores and such; perfect for shoppers! As well as this, there were many clubs and I believe there are many festivals here. There was a lot of good food here and I would really suggest coming here for at least 2 hours if you have the time. Although not the sole purpose, there is also a great likelihood of meeting Korean celebrities here which is just an extra bonus for coming here. I would definitely suggest coming to this busy, young, exciting place."
Bagets!,"If one intends to experience an upbeat vibe almost nightly, then come to Hongdae, where weekends become a festival in itself."
Crowded but nice,"I went during summer holiday to this area. There were many street artist doing dancing, singing, and playing music. They were plenty of restaurant and of course clothing stores for ladies :)I also a very nice bingsoo in this area, for unfortunately I forgot the restaurant name :( because the store all written in Hangul.."
"Art, Music, Dancing and Shopping","Art, Music, Dancing and Shopping ... and Eating. This place is comprised of a young and vibrant crowd have fun, being in a place to be and enjoying all the street vendors, food joints, shopping and the gathering of people singing, K-Pop dancing or showing art designs. Very enjoyable to spend the day."
Buskers and KPOP fangirls,A cool little street lines with lots of great places to eat and snack foods to buy.The buskers vary in quality but it can be a small insight into the youth culture specific to Korea.Easy to waste a lot of time here.
Must-see at night,"We lived in the Hongdae area and went there on most nights. It's very lively and there's always something to do. There are many shops in the area and food. Our favorite thing to do was to simply walk around and go see the street performers at night (dance, singing). They are very talented!"
Taking a walk,"We came here on our first attempt to use the metro after we had been awake for 24 hours and we made it! I particularly liked the energy: young people everywhere , little boutique eateries and bars! I particularly liked the look of what a lot of them were eating: a large drink container with a plastic tray fitted to the top, with meat in it! Interesting place to visit!"
Great vibe,Lots of shopping and restaurants in the area. Many street performers around as well. Street food is available too.
One of the places to shop,Affordable price in this area.We bought ice cream waffle and pie waffle at the price of 1000 won each compare to Myeong-dong at 2000/3000 won.It's delicious too.
Great atmosphere,"If you want to spend a night on the town, go to this place.It really has a nice atmosphere and there is live music everywhere on the streets. There are a lot of restaurants and shops. It is a better place than the Myeongdong area."
must go,"shopping, eating, enjoying street performances - all in one.this is more high-end compared to Ewha women university area. but the things sold here are compared to designers' quality and more unique finds can be found here. alot of cafe with great interiors decoration and free wifi !! guys you can wait here for your gfs to finish her shopping ! "
"Very vibrant, lively and lots of shops","ironically, i found the shops here sell cheaper for some items compare to myeongdong. Anyway, it is full of people , so many things to do and eat"
Taste of youth culture in Korea,"Although it's a bit far from city centre this place definitely worth a visit. You'' be a part of some art performances, you'll taste local street food, you'll meet students. And you'll just feel as if you are in college again :)"
Hippest Cat,"Funky, petite ,chic are the words. Ideal place for shopping , dinning and spend a whole chilling afternoon. Wish I can find a decent boutique hotel around for my next Seoul Visit. Tags: Young people or at least Young At Heart."
Shopping is good ,"I have a 16 and a 12 years old with me during this trip. They had fun walking around the area and shopping around. You won't be disappointed. Oh, try the Isaac sandwiches shop, unlike the other Isaac shops on the street, this one is like a coffee shop that you can sit down and enjoy the sandwiches. "
Just different ,"We have visited the main road at Hongik University Station every visit but never taken a step back to see the streets around the university itself. We were blown away by the difference one street made. The stalls, shops, restaurants and atmosphere were just so different and the student base really captured a lively presence. We found an amazing all-you-can eat Korean BBQ restaurant and my daughter found some well priced trendy clothes to take home. Watermelon juice in a small watermelon. Visited 2 afternoons in a row to see it all."
Opening Ceremony of Mapo Tourist information center ,"Mapo tourist information center's opening event was held at Hongdae exit 8, Hongdae pedestrian street. It's a new tourism resource of Mapo to help people to know more about Mapo. If you ever visit Hongdae, do stop by there to get a map or ask informations about Mapo or Hongdae. "
Lost it's uniqueness.,"This place used to be the hub of art and culture, the heart of creativity.Now, it's just become a shopping / eating district.Sad."
"It says University. If you're in college, this is THE place","Shops open until 11, restaurants open till 4 on weekends and sometimes it's 24 hours for your KBBQ fill. The youth are everywhere. Your favorite brand name shops are here as well like Adidas, New Balance, etc. Two ABC Shoe Marts here from Japan, too, if you're into it. If you need a quiet coffee shop to get away from it, take exit 3 from Hongik Station and it should be to your left. Have fun. "
Hipster and lively place,Hipster and lively place For street shopping and people watching.Many local uni students around and cute cafe to sit and take a rest 
Great teenagers place to enjoy nightlife,I went there with friends then we bought the ticket inside the club it was total different from the club in my country 
Go on a Saturday,Saturday night is the best day of the week to visit. Full of university students doing street performances.
Opening Ceremony of Mapo Tourist Information Centre,"I attended the opening ceremony of Mapo Tourist Information Centre just two days ago. It was nice to see them making so much effort to introduce tourists to different places in the Mapo area and not just the famous shopping street. They also had a traditional korean dance performance, also known as ""samul nori"" to let tourist get in touch with the more traditional side of their culture, in addition to other activities like customized paper fan with calligraphy written by hand of your own choice of wordings and sending a postcard home for free. There's also a hanbok wearing experience too. My most memorable experience was taking the cycle rickshaw. It was a bumpy yet thrilling ride as the cyclist brought us around the Mapo area."
"Busy, bustling, loud, crowded, full of everything","There are several areas in Hongik - I recommend leaving a few hours and allowing yourself to wander and get lost/get found/get lost again/get found again. This, plus Trip Advisor, is the best way to find a great place to eat, or hang out. "
Hello KITTY cafe HONGDAE,Hello kitty cafe moved to a new location in Hongdae that is off the main waking street. So it's not as easy to spot and it's a lot less crowded since we last visited in 2014. It's on a much bigger premise and we recommend this cafe to everyone to visit. Yummy yogurt! 
Makes me feel young again! ,"Lovely place especially at night, with street performances everywhere. Lovely crowd! And when you're tired of walking or shopping, there are tons of cafes and restaurants to choose from. Great place to feel the local young vibes! "
Can't go wrong,There's always something going on in Hongdae. Good shopping and people watching. Great way to spend a day!
Always a show,"You can always listen to an indie band, watch a K-pop girl band show or some people doing some acrobatic figures with advertising signs."
Local Vibes,"We strolled around this area after dinner and there was a small street fair. The area is famous for the nightlife because of the college students. The koraoke and lounges are pretty nice, just make sure to check online which ones have better reviews, some try to trick tourist!"
Capital's youth-culture hub,"There's a lot to do in Hongdae as there's many universities around this area. Lots of streets performance, restaurants and cafes around. If you need to have a great time you can find it here. I've heard from my Korean Friend that clubs here are quite good. I must try it next time. :)"
Free entertainment!!!,"Lots of kids come down here to sing and dance in front of an audience, they are very good! We even saw a magic show. Tons of shopping and cafes. "
Super crowded,"Charming neighborhood catering mostly to younger crowds. Shopping and eating being the main attraction, it is worth visiting."
Arts and crafts gem,"A vibrant and youthful place to spend a few hours! The art market on Saturday afternoon are filled with young artists who specialise in painting, sewing, engraving, leather work, jewelries, and music!"
A place suitable for young people,There are many restaurants and shops in the area which attracts many young people to come in the evening. Sometimes some people even busking and performing guitar or dance in the area which attracted so many people to enjoy their shows. Products are quite fancy in the shops and a good place to spend an evening with friends by shopping and playing different games such as baseball hitting or darting.
Definitely a must go for young people ,Needless to say there are a lot of nice coffee shops and cafe to choose from. Also good for shopping for young people. Really like it here and next time I should come here at night. 
Love it ,"I think its a great place because of the buskers and all the livelihood. People are hanging out and having a good time and you meet lots of cool people, and when you are in Korea is this area a must visit ❤️"
Teenagers spot,"Hongik, teenagers favorite place, is a place where is full of shopping stores with fashionable clothes and lots of restaurant. In the weekends, there is full of teenager. Some shows their talented voice or dancing. Most of shopping stores sell their stuff in non-expensive price. You can see how Korean fashion is in Hongik. It is like Myeong-dong for teenager. Moreover, a famous club named ""Cocoon"" located there near Artbox. Its the place I recommend to go. "
Youth culture in Seoul,"HongDae has a different feel then the rest of Seoul. It has a youthful vibrancy, with many hip stores and cafes. "
A fun place for youths,"Hongdae area (as how the local would call it) is full of energy and creativity. It is a good place to shop and eat during the day and to have fun and enjoy the youth-vibes during the night. There are many busking performances and clubs operating at night. Hongdae also offers a wide range of food and dessert places, you would never run out of choice!Hongdae is designed for everyone, with a very good location and subway connectivity. Yes, you can be very cultural in Hongdae with plenty of Saju (the Korean fortune-telling) and K-style clothes at a very affordable price. However, if K-style clothing is not your style, you can always visit the international brand stores like Bershka and F21. Tips: there are many affordable lodgings in the area, suitable for you who want to feel K-nightlife. But I don't recommend Hongdae for people who do not like crowded places as Hongdae tend to be swarmed with youths."
 Beautiful tea house,Very refreshing cafe with decent selection of tea offering. Seats are on 2nd and 3rd floor and it's very very pretty. Good place to hide from crowd at hongdae shopping street. 
a street with many things on sale as it was started out for university students,"This place was meant for university students who has little spending power in the past, however, due to popularity in products, it has attracted more and more foreigners into the place. There are many shops selling things at a cheaper price, and don't be surprised to see many students walking around. Easily access by the Seoul Metro network."
Interesting and fun place to visit,It is different from other shopping areas that I had visited. Many interesting shops and restaurants. Suitable for young and old. Very alive and busy place
Full of energy and fresh blood ;-),"Really loved this part of Seoul, it is full of energy and fresh blood ;-)Either you come here in the afternoon or in the evening you will experience hustle of the youth and great atmospere. A lot of small and big shops, different cafes and restaurants, hundreds and hundres of young people moving back and forth. Must visit, absolutely!"
Bustling street!,The area around Hongik University is very happening from evening onwards. There street performances like singing and dancing all along the street. There is also a lot of shops and restaurants around and the street is most famous for its nightclubs. 
Vibrant Area,"It's such a joy to be walking around in Hongdae area. It is so full of life. There are many teenagers doing their musical & dance performances everywhere on the street. Alot of eatery, not much of a shopping area compared to Myeongdong. Tonnes of street food too. We hang out in this area most of the time."
congested with uni students. beware of the super active youths that will run to get to the subways,i enjoyed this area as this is packed with the youths who are energetic. the surrounding also happening suits the youth souls. little advance in clothing gadgets cafes compared to other places in seoul. but the price is bit higher compared to the shops in other streets.
Cool vibe of modern Seoul,"Went here mostly for my 22 yr. old daughter but my husband and I loved it too. So much to see for all your senses-street food, entertainers (mostly singers) on the streets, loads of eateries, shops including skin care (in beauty obsessed Korea) and best part was the people watching!"
Too loud and too crowded ,We dropped by to see how the area is like at around 7pm. It was very noisy and crowded. Lots of street performers with amplifiers and smokers around. We walked around for a while and couldn't bear it any longer. Guess we are too old for this neighborhood. Couldn't find any nice shops which I was hoping to find either. 
Shopping eating shopping eating ,Wow a place that I spend too long due to shopping and eating ... even with baby ...For us not a problem .. able to do people watch...Nice place Feel Young 
Youth and trendsetter,"Hongdae is always known to be the IT place. Weekday is good for you to stroll around the art school. Weekend night, hongdae will be crowded with people line up for clubs and food. Lots of street performers on the street also. It's quite an experience when you're there to join the crowd. If you like street fashion, hongdae is the place to go.You can find the HQ of famous make up/street wear style nanda.You also find kakao talk store and museum"
Love the Street Performance,"Came here several times during the daytime to hunt for foods, clothes and local goods as souvenir. Heard from my friend that there will be street performer showing their awesome talent on weekends night and I want to check that out (I never watch any street performance in Seoul before). To my surprise, there was a lot of street performer teams scattered throughout the street, and most of them start do their things (dancing/singing/magic show etc) as early as 5pm. I'm interested in watching the dance group do their synchronize dance move, some have group names some don't. There is one dance group so memorable and amazing, they made me stuck there watching them until 10pm!!. For me, this was the first time I feel the charm of Hongdae street (even though I went there many times), it was so lively and happening during night especially on weekend."
Best Tourist Spot for young people,So many things to do in Hongik street or commonly referred to Hongdae by the locals. Many restaurants and shops around this area. A 5/5 star location if you are a young person who is in Korea.
"Hangout, Chill and People-Watch",Lots of coffee shops to choose from. I like coffee shops on the higher floors so I can just enjoy my iced coffee and people-watch. :)
Nice street for a walk,The street is nice and you can find many youngsters around the area. Many shops selling fashion wear for youngsters. Do visit some of the cafes.
Vibrant shopping and eating street,"Prefer this street to Myeongdong. You would still get the skin care outlets here but less crowded and harassment from the sales staff. Clothes, socks and caps are cheap. Good selection of restaurants."
"Great spot to.eat, shop and.chill","Lots of shops and.stalls, but not fancy stuff, mainly food and accessories. Its better late afternoon to evening when it gets more lively with Uni artists performing in the streets.Evenings there are discos and pretty girls walking everywhere."
Hype area,"This area is for people who like to be surrounded by many people, with a lot of shops, restaurant, cafe. You never get enough time to spend here.A lot of young people gather in this area. They made street performance, such as K pop dance, singing and other art performance.It so much different in the morning, while this place is quite and not so much people pass over.If you like to shop for unique things, tried to open your eyes looking in the distro shops here. And the price is reasonable.For clothing, there're a lot of fashion shops here. Must visit place while in seoul "
Vibrant and great atmosphere !!,We came across this street on our way to the trick eye museum. It's a great spot for shopping and just roaming around to see free street performances. You will find lots of young college and school kids roaming around . Overall the place is very vibrant and a good visit if you are around.
Clubss and Shopping,"There's a lot of restaurant and cafe here and several stores like forever 21, Zara, etc. In most part of the street, there will be university performers performing their talent like singing, dancing, rapping but these days, more rapping performance can be seen. This place has been featured in a lot of K-dramas (playground esp.) and many clubs can be seen here. I find the cheapest place to buy hat is here (6000 won per hat by 2 becomes 10000 won)"
Vibrant Street with fashionable atmosphere,"First stop in Seoul from airport. So excited to try their street food (fish cake) with soup. Wow! A must in Korea...strolling around the vicinity around 9-10pm is just nice, not so crowded. Tried the local wine: Soju... tasted like vodka...with BBQ of course. Trendy cafe-bar all over the place. Enjoyed my short visit, too bad need to fly out the next day for an important trip elsewhere. Will visit this place in my next Seoul visit. Recommended."
too crowded,"yes, again......great place for shopperholics....it is too crowded for me.everyway is packed with people.but the street live music performance is awesome.great young talented performers....BRAVO!!! Keep up!"
Always packed!,"Awesome lively street to walk along. ...as long as you are not in a hurry! So crowded on weekends. Shops, restaurants, museums, street stalls, street performances...it's all happening!Great atmosphere and lots to see. The tourist information centre is great, good English speaking staff who bend over backwards to help. "
Great atmosphere!,"Very busy area during the evenings with live performances, shops, restaurants and clubs. It's easy to get to and there's a lot of younger people here (close to the university) and the atmosphere is vibrant which is very pleasant. I would recommend anyone in Seoul to visit Hongdae."

Vibrant n youthful ambience,"Went there on a sat late morning n it was already brimming w young people crowding round all the street performers. Some of the acts were really outstanding n deserves recognition but some were outright fun n amateur, guess they r all students. Loads of restaurants n cafes to be enjoyed if you get tired. There's some shopping along the side streets. Gets really crowded ard 3-5pm.We really enjoyed ourselves! Nice place to go n spend your afternoon!"
Home for Us,"We stayed in a guesthouse here for our 10-day visit to Seoul, and we LOVED it. Honda was really home to us. At night when the streets get busy is the best - there's so much activity, and a lot of F&B places that only open in the night. After dinner, we like to stop by the street where lots of Korea's young talents come to show case their singing and dancing skills - these kids are amazing! The shopping there is awesome too! You can pretty much find anything you need there! The youth really add a lively bustling atmosphere and we were so happy that we stayed there during this visit. Hongik University subway station is also an interchange station so getting around to other places was really convenient. There are lots of malls on the other side of hongdae as well, and we even caught 2 movies at the Lotte cinema (look out for the uniqlo).We're definitely staying in Hongdae on our next visit!"
Shopping trip ,"My wife and I had heard so much about this place from friends who had visited Seoul before that we felt we should see the place for ourselves.This location is accessible by subway. Take the green line 2 which will bring you to the Hongik University Station . Walk out of the station and you are right smack at the location. Its basically a University Town and we could see hundreds of students going about the town.In addition to the shops, the streets are lined with wares for sale on the sidewalks. I found a great variety of goods sold which include ladies apparel, shoes , sun glasses, children's toys . There are also ample Korean restaurants in the area . For lunch, we decided to patronize a Vietnamese Restaurant instead . We found the food served at Pho Mons to be authentic and delicious. "
Do not miss this when you visit Seoul!,Street performers really lighten up the mood when you visit Hongdae at night. You shouldn't miss out on all the good bargains as well! Shop till you drop.
Hongdae's Youthful Energy is Contagious,"I spent my teens and early 20s in a university town, so I totally get Hongdae. I always make it my base when I visit Seoul. Explore its cafes, check out the best busking places, stay up late at its bars and BBQ places. "
Bustling and hangout spot for the young!,"Such a busy spot full of food, restaurants and plenty of shopping. Not too far from the subway station too. The market was a bit of a let down as the usual spot is being renovated. "
"Street of Youth, Arts, Shopping and Korean Meals",It was very very busy with young crowd but it was a good way to experience local lifestyle. I loved Korean BBQ here and how there were a lot of buskers looking for their lucks to become a K-Pop Singers. There are also a good area for shopping
Fun hangout!,"The streets of Hongik University had so much fun food, cute stores and affordable things to do for the college students of Hongik. You'll be in for a huge surprise if you are from the United States, cause you don't have this kind of atmosphere at any of the universities in America. We ate too much, but a little bit of everything we saw. It's truly a fun place to hang out with adult children. We tried the dollar karaoke booths, you pay 1,000won for four songs. There are many places to grab a drink, eat, places to buy souvenirs. Totally worth spending a day here with friends or family. If you plan to visit Seoul, this is one place you want to visit! "
Singing and dancing,"Follow the sound of the music. This street is filled with young artist waiting for their break. You have tons of street performers at night. You will find solo artists, group singers, group dancers, solo dancers, they have it all. It's nice just walking the streets and listening and watching the artists perform. There's also a lot of restaurants and shops along this street, so if you're tired of watching the performances you can eat and shop."
Street of cafes,"Many cafes to visit, and shopping plenty. It was a Saturday when we went, so it was crowded with people around, even in the park."
Bustling ,"Being in the university quarter, the area is abundant in all sorts of things to cater the young ones. Restaurants, eateries, bars, clubs, boutiques selling stylish accessories are all within walking distance. The area becomes busier in the evening when the street food stalls start their business. The Kakao store and cafe is around the corner too, whoever is interested in the Kakao characters will definitely be thrilled to be there, but beware of the long queue to get in."
Love It,Love it!!! Enjoy shopping at this street because its near to our hotel. This street were happening and full with young crowd. No need to go to Myeondong because its a Cosmetic Heaven too.
Fun,"This is the funny place where most of people are students studying around, and the young people also prefer to come here for shopping small accessories and having meals. There are many good restaurants in this area."
Nice shopping street for all,Enjoyed shopping and settling my dinner in Hongik University Street.It is definitely worth going and accessible by subway and AREX trains!
Shopping street for young people,"Vibrant shopping street in the Hongik area full of shops, cafes and convenient stores target younger generation shoppers."
"A famous, not to be missed location","If you are looking to soak up the crowds and experience something relaxing and unique in Korea, Hongdae area of Seoul is the place to be. There are hundreds of restaurants, coffee shops, street food stands, bars, and shops in this area to explore. One street is almost exclusively blocks and blocks of restaurants and bars. Whenever you are walking around in the restaurant/bar area expect the unexpected. You never know when you will see a crowd of people in the street being entertained by random buskers, dancers, artist, magicians and comedians. You may have an experience like I did, where I say a large group of professional photographers setting up for an event. I hung around for about 20 minutes before a brand new k-pop girl group showed up to perform their debut album for the crowd of 75-125 people that happened upon it.I have seen several k-dramas and Korean movies being filmed here, as well as walking up on random Korean celebrities enjoying a day out in public. This area is constantly changing and evolving and you never know what you'll find. Also, not to be missed, is the Trick Eye and Love museums located here. Bring enough money to spend on random things that you never expected to find. The inexpensive unique trinkets, souvenirs, shirts with hilarious Engrish, and delicious street food (in addition to all the great restaurants) will have you happily spending more than you expected.Awsome to walk around in the winter (bundle up) but even more exciting in the summer, just be prepared for shoulder-to-shoulder crowds, up and down the streets in some areas in the summer.This can be an all day excursion. I would plan to be here before lunch to fill up on all the delicious street food you will want to experience then stay till sundown and enjoy the nightlife and a delicious restaurant. Dont be afraid to venture off the main road, into the alleys for an even richer experience, including smaller unique boutiques, coffee shops and some wonderful artwork/graffiti.Tip: Bring extra battery power for your camera, you'll need it."
Visited Hongdae on a pedicab,"We were really tired walking out in the street in cold winter weather. It's a nice change to explore the city in a pedicab. The rider took us in a pedicab and rode us around the Hongdae area which is where Hongik University is. He told us where the popular food places with young people were, the popular shopping places, the quaint dining places where Korean movies and dramas were filmed. The rider let us out from the pedicab and took pictures for us and with us. Oh did I mentioned, we were sitting in pedicab that was shielded from the cold with a clear plastic shade in front so that we could see the outside but not be in the cold. It was a pleasant experience. "
"happy trip,happy place of accomodation","happening but happy trip, stayed at a convenient place in Myeongdong, can always return to hotel to rest abit and continue shopping and eating again.experienced snowing for the first time after few trips, nice shopping except for unpleasant touting sales outside cosmetic shops. Language barrier with the authentic locals, can be hosted with unfriendly services at cafes or restaurants, but just be courteous and speak simple English to get by. If you lost your way, find a young couple to help you, show them the places of interest, they generally can speak English and will give their utmost help. Will be back again for shopping, eating and drinking Hite with nice chicken wings. "
Street Scene,"An eclectic mix of restaurants, bars, shops and street vendors selling all kinds of different products. Plus the street performers singing and dancing make this a great place to people watch."
Hip place for korean youngster,"it's very popular place among locals specially korean students..surrounded by shops, snacks street, places to eats.,got very crowded during weekend..this price range here cheaper than myeongdong"
Great atmosphere,"Lots to see, to eat, to buy, and to listen to. Nice restaurants, lots of local artists, performances and shops. Everything you need to have a great time you can find here."
Full of vomit and sewerage smells,"Lived here and ate a few meals here. Watch where you step or you might accidentally step in people's vomit. Not sure why the sewerage smells so bad in Seoul. It is not particularly bad in Hongik but mix it with alcohol and drunk stench, you get the idea. There is some shopping here but you can find it anywhere else. "
Nightlife,"If you are looking for some fun, visit Hongik University Street (a.k.a Hongdae). This is where are all the youngsters hang out for shopping, drinking and clubbing. I used to hang out here with friends as it is a hip place to visit. It gets crowded on weekends and holidays so be prepared to get squished by people. There are many restaurants around and quite affordable since it's near a university. Popular places will be packed and wait times will be long so plan ahead. Hongik University is also known for their art department so there are some unique shops around. There are also many street musicians busking so expect to hear music on the streets. This is a perfect place for a fun night out in town if you are into drinking and clubbing!"
Full of young energy,"Lots of young people coming here in the afternoon to the middle of the night. Lots of restaurant but i was not sure which one is good. Anyway, the restaurant seems like good for group of friends,.and i m only by myself. Window Shopping is fun. Actually the clothes are ki d of expensive and not with good quality,comparing the same $ but what i can get in US or Canada."
CROWDED YET EXCITING!,"My eyes move to the left and right, feels like want to buy all the cute stuff shown in the shops along the street, street foods really mouth-watering (a really tall ice cream, chicken and cheese with some tteokbokki and potatoes inside, and many more!) When it's getting late at night, it will be more crowded with people. Really nice place to visit to see korean university life."
Great street at night,We walked this street with our kids (6 and 9) at night on our way to the Hello Kitty cafe. It was crowded and had a great atmosphere. In the middle of the street area there were performers lined up group after group and they were all singing and dancing to modern k-pop style music. The kids enjoyed that. There are great restaurants lining the street including both korean and western options.It is definitely worth checking out if in the area. 
Perfect for Youth and Teens,"This is a place where all funky and vibe atmosphere can be found. Very lively and many live happenings like mini concert, street dance, variety of stores, some street foods, coffee shops and restaurants."
It's basic a University Street,"Some streets and a lot of restaurants, cafes and bars. A lot of options to eat and enjoy the South Korean Night."
Colours and people everywhere,"A local university area that showcase more tourists now than students. Go there if you're young or if you enjoy overly crowded places and loud music blasting in your ears literally from every shop. It's worth checking out once.. if you're new to Seoul. Street buskers are a regular, also there are some bigger European and American clothing stores like Zara and Forever21, if that is your cup of tea. Other than that, bars and eateries everywhere you look. I think it's better to visit during summer."
Vibrant area,Students everywhere! Lots of stores and street vendors selling things that young people buy. Nice cafes and restaurants. Fun to view the local scene.
Interesting street!,"Many café, restaurant, shops selling clothes and skin care. Lively and crowded. Many live bands and street performance. Interesting place to visit!"
Great outdoor shopping site for younger people,"Here You will find cute little shops lining the street of hongdae (mainly selling clothes and shoes). As from the name you know thats its located by the Hongik university so the majority of the people you see here are university students. The clothes and shoes you find here are mostly for younger people (university students age or younger adults). The prices tend to be a little bit cheaper than other Seoul shopping streets, maybe so that the university students can afford them. They also have a lot of street side stalls selling korean traditional street food and clothes, but not as much as in myeong-dong. If you want to try eating spicy ttebokki (rice cakes in red hot sauce) or sundae (blood sausages) and korean style tempura in a plastic covered road stalls tend by an ahjumma (older ladies, usually a grandma age) like what you usually see in K-drama then you can try them out there as i saw many stalls around the area. Just pick a bigger and cleaner stall as i saw some of them are gaudy looking. It is a standing eating stall and you just tell the ahjumma what you want then she will serve it to you and pay only after you finish eating. For people with younger kids please dont forget to bring a stroller with you because streets in hongdae tend to go up and down hill. Great outdoor shopping avenue, just wear thicker clothes as the temperature might get much colder at night during winter."
Cool people,"Great for people watching, eating and drinking. You'll see tonnes of different uni students street performing. It's quite the spot. "
Lively place,"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place.I think this place is better than myeongdong and dongdaemun as their price is more affordable and more fashionable.Not to mentioned the food over there is excellent.If you saw a restaurant which sells self rotating meat skewers,don't hesitate to dine in there,it was divinely delicious!"
What a crowd,"Hongik is where all the arty, trendy and hipsters tend to congregate. University here is known for its liberal arts and so, you can imagine the values at this place. This is the place where young and aspiring designers, artists, musicians hone their crafts and so, you can feel the vibe here. Be mindful of the crowd here though. Gate 9 of Hongik Ip Gu (University) metro station is the one that's the most frequented and sometimes, it would take you over ten minutes to get from the bottom of the stairs to the top of the stairs. If you haven't been to Seoul before, then, this should be a rather eye widening encounter for you. You only live once...Why not..."
Fun and Youthful Street in Korea,Another good place to shop in Korea. Things are cheaper here too! There are a lot eatery and street performance in Hongdae! Make sure you visit this place and experience the youthful vibes here!
Night life on point!,"Literally right next to the train station, Hongdae offers a modern look into Seoul. Roaming the streets at night my friend and I went past many interesting restaurants, clothes stores and street busking. Would come again !"
Crowded and good local good.,"We really enjoyed walking around as there were many people and much life around.We don't really like shopping, but there is a great are for it. What we did enjoyed if the food! We specially liked one BBQ classic tinny restaurant, which I cannot remember the name which was awesome. But there are many and all seems to be very good, is a good area to have lunch or dinner and in general, low- medium budget."
Shop shop shop!,"Quite similar to other shopping area. There are shops everywhere along the street. To go here, take a subway to Hongik University Station (Line 2) Exit #2."
Nice little street ,Been there few times and is really a good place to go for nice shopping and cheap but nice food. The entire street is full of shops selling inexpensive stuff that is Korean made (of course there are china made ones too) and quite unique. Give it a shot. Take the train to Hongik University station and exit by 8 or 9 
Vibrant area which you cannot miss,"Hongdae area is one where you can feel the youthful vibes in korea! It has a good mix of shopping areas and pub / restaurant areas. There are also many claw machines where you can catch soft toys of all sorts! If you are looking for a good night time shopping, this is a good alternative to myeongdong! :) "
Fun,mostly youngsters are gather . lots of foreigners are visited . i enjoyed here for drinks and clubs .
Shopping street,"A lot of shops selling young people's fashion . Clothes , shoes and so on . A lot of clothes for guys too . Surrounding area also has quite a lot of food store."
Interesting edgy street,We stayed in Hongdae and only 5 mins away from the popular streetwalk. The street (without performers) are busy with crowds even on weekday. Nice reasonable priced clothes and it's good enough for window shopping. The street came alive on Friday night with youngsters performing their arts. Beware of incoming cars thought the street is not closed to traffic. Wonderful place!
"Lively, happening, hipster place","Lots of young people, shopping, good food, street performers by kpop wannabes! Great nightlife. Must visit if you are in Seoul!"
Crowded and happenning,"Hongik University Street is different from the Myeongdong and is definitely a must-see place. There were a lot of students at night and a lot of stalls as well. However, there were lesser cosmetics shops compared to Myeongdong as this is a university street rather than a shopping street."
lively place,"Full of life especially during evening. Many great street artists, lot's of places for shopping and dining."
Hongdae... a must!,"I always visit this place whenever I'm in Seoul. I love the vibe and explore the food, shops and cafes here. You can even see somestreet musicians perform at night. Definitely great for shopping!"
Visit to Hongik," During the visit to Seoul of Korea, I also go to visit a famous area---Hongik, which is a commercial place for people to go shopping. I suppose that it is really a great place to know more about fashion. As we all know, the K-pop music of Korea is quite popular all over the world, especially among the youngers. I enjoy the Korean music a lot, it is with the strong beat as well as the wonderful music. There are some teenager that are keen on the K-pop music and dancing. They perform in the street by themselves, this type of situation also attracts many passer-by’s attention. You will have a enjoyment of sighting and listening. What’s more, there are also other Korean style food to have a try. I think that the tourists can make a schedule to plan the routine to Hongik. Hope you guys enjoy yourself!"
Great energy!,This area is very popular for college students. They have people playing musical instruments as well as street performances. It's crowded during the weekend because there are tons of restaurants plus clubs. There are many many places to eat and I do recommend walking around the street of Hongdae and get a feel for it! We had a good time walking around. It's a bit dirty because of the garbage that get pilled up at night but it's fun to see what it's like to living in college town of Seoul.
Must visit,"Place is absoultely amazing during weekends. Lots of street performers, street food and outdoor shops. Fun to watch people get really drunk. "
Korean night life,Very happening at night. Lots of teenagers come for shopping and show there performance beside the street. You can enjoy street food and night club at Hongdae. Recommended place to go.
great bars - street musicians - shopping,"When coming here you can find everything you need to not only have a good day, but also a nice evening! There are tons of shops that sell a great variety of goods. A great number of cafés, bars and restaurants make it a tough decision on where to eat or have a drink. You might also just sit outside and listen to the street musiciansy which play all kinds of music, both korean as well as western styles!"
The place to shop,"A small street but with big varieties.This street got shops on both sides serving teenagers and 30-40s who will most probably find their taste.Most of the shops are for females, but some male shops are worth the seek.Prices are near the low end due to the fact of being next to the university and suited to the students. It is worth shopping here."
Popular amongst young people and for its nightlife,"This place is well known amongst the younger generation and for its nightlife. There are plenty of shops for the shopaholics, restaurants for the foodies and clubs and bars for those who love to party."
For young people. ,"Many clubs and bars here , restaurants and many more. From evening to night it's non stop party! I suggest this place for young people and nightlife people. This place is never sleep. You can enjoy shopping till 12am. Many night clubs there for teenager , cost you about 20000-30000 won per 1 drink and entrance fee. Some club they have lady night for the entrance free. Im not into party actually so i have no idea for inside cuz i never have thought to wait in the long line just for party i guess im old:(. And yes my korean friend said that they check paasport and age. If you are more than 29 you cant go inside but foreigner maybe it's exemption. However it is a must place to visit. "
"Evening dinner, shopping","Very noisy place, lots of shops and street food places. Sometimes u could c the attractions of local music bands and dance teams "
Super happening hongdae - shopping N eating fun,"Come to hong dae the university town for some young bustling crowd, shopping and food ! Quite enjoy the life here but it can get overwhelming towards nightfall. So if you prefer some quiet and more space, come earlier and leave before it hits 5pm-6pm. Otherwise, if you are into night life - you will love the street performers, some drinks and more street food and vendors. "
Hip area with plenty of shops and restaurants,It is a great area to walk around and to experience local culture. Lots of theme cafes to try out.Very vibrant in the night.
Solo in Seoul ,"Fun area with plenty of bars, restaurants and clubs. The shopping is good with plenty of vendors too. I was surprised that the coffee was so good. I'm from the Seattle area and I was impressed. The animal cafes are unique; cat dog sheep and raccoon. I will go back soon too much to see in a week."
Tons of stuff to do! ,"Whole bunch of stuff to do from young to old! Street performances, H&M and Forever 21 and the Trick eye museum! Vendors are all over the place and the street food is yummy! "
Unexpected surprises beckon at the Children's Playground.,"Another happening place at Hongdae is the Children's Park. On Saturday nights, the lights and the crowd of college students make the place come alive. Young performers sing, dance or rap...each group having their own styles, and attracting fans from the crowd. When we were there, we were amazed at the talent and versatility of a boy band group who wowed the audience with their rapping skills. They had a good rapport with the audience and soon participation was encouraged. Some were dancing with the beat, but is was a wonderful surprise to see a foreign student who moved from among the crowd to the makeshift stage and rapped her heart away. She definitely stole the hearts of the audience and the performers. If you are fond of music and unconventional ways of the Korean youth express their passions, go and experience what we did. Best part? It's free."
Happening place with local taste,This are is surrounded by University's students and the goods here are more affordable compare to city centre. It will be a great place for foodies to try the local street delicacies. Many restaurants and shopping outlets over here.
"Hip and trendy place, especially at night","Hongdae is a place that can be seen both during the day and at night. For us, we decided to visit on a Sunday night, when there are more crowds compared to the weekdays.Hongdae is the place when you can get to see street markets and performances by young people, especially students as it is located near the university areas. In that sense, it reminded us a little of Taiwan's Ximending area or Singapore's Bugis Street, although I would say it really isn't an exact comparison.There are plenty of places to eat and shop, with street food all around the place and especially the noraebang(s) (노래방) and the DVD bangs, which are places for people to sing karaoke and watch DVDs in a private space respectively. This is something that is rather unique in South Korea and should be seen first hand yourself to understand the South Korean culture better. There are also the occasional PC bang, which is basically a LAN gaming café, but these are getting a little more difficult to be seen nowadays though.At night though, things change a little. Other places in Seoul after 10pm or 11pm might be winding down for the night, but not Hongdae. At 11pm, the nightclubs and bars start to open and this is when you will see many young clubbers queueing up to get into these places for a night of clubbing and fun, with many opening until 2am or 3am. This is where sometimes people do get rather drunk until sometimes, they need help from their friends to prevent stumbling onto the pavement when walking, so do watch your step.Unfortunately, on the day we went Hongdae itself, it was raining on and off, and the next day was a public holiday, so it took us a long time to get a taxi back to our hotel. Still, we do wish to come back to Hongdae again though, probably during daytime, to see the difference. Overall, a place that should not be missed for a first time traveler."
weekend market,as in many street markets in seoul you should not miss this one. lots of independent craft stalls on weekend. on weekdays you can mingle with the locals and not so much on tourists because this area is for the hip and young crowd as this is an university area.
The place come to live during night time,"This area came to live during night time with live performance, shops, restaurants and bar. A love of young people and tourist love this area. But most of the bar and restaurants not suitable for solo traveller. And the shops in the area change frequently."
Good walking street.,"Nice atmosphere around the place, lots af interesting sites just to watch. Shopping stuff is ample, highly recommended for those who like diversity and socializing with young people."
Your trip to Seoul won't be complete without Hongdae,"Like Myeongdong, Hongdae has everything you could ever need, but instead of beauty stuff, Hongdae is where you shop for (relatively) affordable clothes. There are plenty of cafes, coffee shops, restaurants, and pubs/bars to choose from, too. Lots of chicken and beer, some noraebangs (karaoke), and many impromptu street performances, too."
Similar to Myeongdong,"Busy street with young people, many restaurants and shops selling clothes and toys. Streets still have many people despite the cold (2-6 deg)."
Fun shopping spot,"This a fun place to visit in Seoul. Lots of shops with clothes, socks, bags, jewelry... coffee shops and places to eat. Enough to keep you exploring all day. Near the University so geared toward a younger crowd but still fun for all ages."
Just average,"The whole area fronts Hongik University and during our particular visit, there was an interesting bazaar with art students selling their ware - from decorative items to jewelry and other artistic creations. Other than this, the small alleyways feature shops and restaurants which can also be found in other areas of Seoul. We were expecting more of the boutique and specialty shops so were slightly disappointed."
good visit spot,"youngsters gathered with many activities especially on weekend, shopping street with many new and fashion goods "
Shopping Street,"This is one the talk about university street. Indeed it is brimming with cafes, restaurants and of cors the numerous beauty product brands and fashion outlets. The clothings style are for youngsters since is near the university. I suppose depending on the month you are here, there are many shops that sells fashion clothings and accessories for youngsters. I was told wthat only Saturday they have flea market too. "
"Hip, happening, and a very friendly place.","A place where local students let their hair down and others gather to enjoy the shops and sights.Unlike many similar areas in the west, you don't have to worry about bad behaviour caused by too much drink."
For the experience,"This place is usually crowded with youngsters and couples. Many clothing shops and some food cafes but the prices here seemed to be slightly higher compared to other tourist places. A lot of street performance and on weekends, there's actually a small area where there's a flea market. Handmade crafts which are quite interesting and beautiful."
My Seoul trip-Hongdae,"One of the interesting places in Seoul It is not far from the city center.Go there during the day and at night.There are a number of shops selling clothes and shoes and other items, with displays along the street outside the shops. The prices of things seemed a bit cheaper here.At night the streets becomes more alive with impromptu performances and lots of people.Do not miss the side streets,I ran into a popup store that was selling good quality candies and cookies for 1,000- 1,500 won."
must visit,"good place to visit, quite a lot of artists perform in the street, remember to pay them tip, since they work very hard to perform and entertain you"
Stay in hongik ,This street wake up as the sun set. There are lots of performance every few steps. As many artist are picked up by agencies here. Lots of restaurants everywhere. 
Totally cool,"Went on a Saturday to go to the Free Market. Loved the area. Great vibe. We were easily some of the oldest people around. Very vibrant area and one that if you're attending university, young and carefree must be a great spot to let loose in!"
Lots of hip and cheap thrills,"Went there in the evening and we're pretty tired already so we weren't able to explore the place that much. But if you are familiar with Busan's Nampodong Fashion Street, this is its counterpart in Seoul. Lots of nice clothes and happenings around the area. We saw group of students dancing and singing like K-pop stars. =) If I were to shop for clothes in Seoul, I'd definitely go here."
Street Art,There is a lot performing along the street from the korean young men and women which is very attractive for tourist or visitors. if you stay outside hongdae area just take a subway stop at hongik university and exit from gate 6. there is a lot of shopping lot as well. some major brand also available. best time to visit is night time. 
Young and trendy,There is many funky boutiques and street stalls. It is nice to just stroll around to enjoy the scene. Good place to have Korean BBQ at a very reasonable price.
Busy and exciting area~,"It's where everybody's at! You can shop, eat, drink and relax! Being right near so many universities it's where everyone comes to hangout. Shopping and eateries is great during the day and you can watch buskers and dancers by night. Day or night life it's all happening here!"
loads of things to see and do,"great place to wander around, buy random things, watch some performance. try the ""kiss the rain"" tiramisu that's famous in korea - it's good!"
Young vibes,I was truly amazed by the young vibes here. So many kinds of fashion items sold here with quite affordable price. I think its a nice idea to stay in a hostel or hotel near this place if you go to seoul
Loved it,"Stayed at Exit 3 which was very lively. It was a 10min walk to the heart of where all the hustling and bustling was. Tons of cafes, restaurants and bars. A lot of hiphop/rnb clubs on 'the hill'."
Seoul heart for night life,"a must go place to experience seoul night life. Lot of food stall, cosmetic shops. I wouldnt recommend to shopping clothes here as it not as cheap as it seems. The quality of the fabric is average, as well as the style."
Q: Do you need to be a Scenester/Hipster/Partygoer to visit? Answer: No! Here's why you Should definately visit~~~,"Yes, obviously this is the place where the liberal minded, forward thinking, new X generation of young Koreans congregate en mass; it is, after all, at the college, which by it's very nature, will have the youth of the country in numbers, and the bars and supporting entertainment within walking distance. So the question is, why go if you are not one of them, or to party?The answer is simple: it is the future of the country. Literally, as the youth will Be the next generation of leaders in business, politics, and drivers of direction of the country. But really, what I mean is this is where you can experience the culture of the NOW of South Korea. Forward looking, in style, thought, desire... the movement of the new, now.Is it the South Korea you expect, festooned with hundreds of years of Confucianism morals and ethics... or a process shaped by generations of religious and old world cultural beliefs? Well, yes, yes it is. Just not in the way you might imagine. To understand, you must see. To see, you must be openminded. To be openminded, you must go without preconception. Leave judgment at the door, thank you.So, go. Go you must, if you want to understand South Korea. Make sense? Who? How? Go, and know. There, now you understand. If you don't, pass. If you get it, go. PS. Best way to experience it, best thing to see? Grab a drink and a snack, sit and watch. THAT is it. Oh, and go on a weekend, after 5 for the full on experience."
"Great place for ""street"" food",Lots of restaurants in this area attracted us every evening to this area. You can have traditional Korean barbecue or cheap topoki:)
An evening at Hongik street,"We love this place as there are plenty of food that we want to try. Things are slightly cheaper here, we bought the Aloe Vera lotion at only KRW3,300.00 as compared to KRW4,400.00"
Mecca of korean teens!!!,"After Myongdong, this attraction is the major meeting point of locals(esp. teens). This street is quite busy frome late morning till night. Fashionistas don't miss trend of korean fashion here. Most products include handbags, backpacks, cosmetics of korean brands and mobile cellphone accessories. There are trick eye museum , ice and love museums too. "
Hongik U,"This area is very trendy, lot of places to eat & shop, I even had a hair cut and color my hair in a salon. although had a little communication issue, but not a big problem... it was interesting."
Entertaining,"We stayed in this area and absolutely loved it! There are lots of delicious restaurants nearby, street food, stalls to shop at and stores as well! On the weekends, they even have busking and other entertainment. It was so much fun and so interesting to see! I would definitely come back here and/or stay here!"
Cheapest clothes in Seoul!,Do your shopping here first! Great Norebang at SU Norebang so make sre you drop in for some singing :)
Loved it!,"An arty place full of street performers, buskers playing really good quality music.The atmosphere was very cool, buzzing but relaxing at the same time. Crowded but not in an off putting way.Loads of shops and restaurants. Best place for choice of food"
Lots of happenings. A place for the young.,"You can see a lot of cafe, restaurants and youngster around. I guess they are university students doing and selling everything that you can imagine . Many youngsters show casing their talents by playing musical instruments , singing and modern dances. Shops lined the street selling everything you can imagine. Too noisy and funny for the elderly. You can even get free hug here. "
Nice and lively area,Interesting shops and coffees. Lots of food around. Has some nice photo spots if you are interested in urban photography 
So much to see and do,"One of the best reasons to stay near Hongik University... so many places to eat and drink, tons of shops, street performers, food vendors. Great area"
Lively night scene,Lots and lots of restaurants!! Long lanes of shopping street. Some bars tooIconic place of korea that u must visit
Loving the trendy and youthful vibes of this place,"This is a place where the youth and youngsters go... It's trendy , with young performers seemingly taking the streets to practise their dance moves and singing skills and there are plenty of small shops and cafes along the street . Shops sell clothes and other accessories at reasonable prices and there are plenty to see and explore , with a lot of fusion food suitable for everyone .Do come later in the day rather than in the morning . It's more ""happening "" in the evening and night .Only downside ? I feel so old here ! Haha"
MORE shopping.....,So many shopping experiences in Seoul. Lots of smaller trendy stalls here with cool bars. My teenager daughter loved the fashion. I guess it is always busy.
Lively Shopping Street,"This is a good place to be staying near when visiting Seoul. It is abundant with shopping stalls, restaurants, cafes and nightclubs. I think it's a good place to take visitors for clothes shopping! The area is quite central so you can easily travel out to other districts via subway from here."
Cute area,"Loads of young people playing at night, really good shooping and trendy bars. I think it's the most foreigners I've seen in Seoul in one place, so not really an ""authentic"" experience."
Busy area,We came on a Saturday late morning and it was pretty busy. Lots of shopping to be done with some stalls at cheap prices. A nice vibrant area catering for the younger crowd however it was nice to walk amongst it and watch street performers dance and sing. When we left in the afternoon there were hoards of people coming out of the metro station. This seems to be the place to hang out on a Saturday afternoon
Good place to hang out,It is very good impression to visit this place during day and night time. This place is the center of university area in Seoul that you may face nice local dining whole day. You may have coffee or dessert in the afternoon and hang out late night in the evening. There is also street local performance in the park up the stairs. Don't miss it.
The best place to party in seoul,"Having lived in Seoul for three years, this place is definetly the best. Interesting cafes, live music and street performances, plenty of delicious restaurants and a young vibrant seen. Lots of bars and clubs for after party and the pricing is some of the cheapest in Seoul depending on which bars you go to. In my opinion far cheaper and more artistic and creative buildings and places to eat, drink and chill than Gangnam. For a night out or even a nice meal or coffee come here. So many new places always open up. Some of my favs include bar 다 and vent. As well as the coffee shops up the hill. "
The place for bars and clubs,"Wow this neighborhood has changed. About 10 years ago this neighborhood had around 10 clubs. Now there's over 30 club, multiple bars, coffee shops and stores. This place is good for a night out. It's geared more towards people in their 20's."
Oasis away from the heat of the day.,This man made stream is close to Gwanghwamun Square. It is sunk below street level and is tasteful paved and catered by ample seating and greenery. The day we visited people were anchoring large white balloons on tethers in the flowing waters. The running waters and shade provided a cooling feel away from the heat of the day. A popular place day and night to relax and enjoy a rest.
A nice walk at night,"Not sure how it was in the morning but it gets lively at night. I stayed at boa guest house so it's just a 5 minutes walk away. I went here during weekday night so it's not too crowded but my friend who went again on a weekend night said that it's really crowded. Got myself a few cute socks, only 1000won each. ☺"
Not suitable for families,I liked the vibe and we enjoyed some food such as the cinammon stick and halal shawerma but it is not really the best choice for a family. Some youth were performing live guitar. Nice :)
My Hongdae.,"I visited at Hongdae last April 2016. I'm very love this place! because have a lot of restaurant, shop and music street. For every people to show something to another people that visit in Hongdae street. For travelers that love to hangout! at the night. Hongdae have a many club for party!! I promise that I have a chance I will visit this area again."
"Full of activities, foods, shopping","HongDae is a great area for travelers, so many great hostels, shopping, foods and clubs. and you can take the airport bus from here, or you can take the airport train from here as well. I always should to stay around Hongdae whenI visit Seoul. I like that Korean young generation are so talented and so confidence, and I can see their live style here."
Street with everything going on...,"Amazing area of Seoul with so much going on during the night time from Friday to Sunday, done the street you will find loads of places to eat and buy clothes/electronics and other items. As well there is various acts down the street from Korean rappers to dancers to magic acts."
Young hip place for couples and college students,It gets bustling after 5pm. The streets are filled with couples and young people. Tons of street food. Many of the cosmetic stores have Chinese speaking employee. Fun place to walk around and enjoy the sights and artwork on the wall. There's also theme cafes like the Hello Kitty Cafe. 
One of our favorite neighborhoods in Seoul,"We were in Seoul for a week, and headed over here on the day before Chuseok (Korean Thanksgiving), not sure what would be opened. We found this to be a very lively neighborhood, like a lot of university districts globally. We were originally looking for the graffiti art, but found much more. We love the restaurant where we had lunch, but are unsure of the name. It was on the street next to the graffiti art and had an industrial/workshop (nuts and bolts) motif. The food and the wait staff were both great. "
"Full of life and activities, great place for shopping","As this is a university street, clothes are supposedly cheaper from 10,000 won and up! Clothes are more trendy, to cater for the university students in Seoul. I went on a Saturday afternoon and wow it was super crowded but it was also a very nice experience to see how lively a street can be. Most of the Korean Skincare brands that could be find in Myeongdong could be found here as well! Such a pity I did not have much time to explore the area but I would say a good 2-4 hours spent here is good! Lots of cafes nearby to chill and grab a nice cool drink on a hot summer weather."
College Student Haven,"Hongdae is legendary in Seoul, and for those of us who have ventured on study abroad campaigns. Two words: Alcohol and Clubs. The youth scene here in Hongdae is some of the liveliest in the world. If clubbing and alcohol aren't your forte, however, never fear! Hongdae is more than clubbing and drinking, there are ample options for shopping, eating some amazing street food or at the restaurants littered around the area. But we are here to talk about the Main Street, which every night seems to have street performers of all types, as well as famous Korean YouTubers vlogging in the streets. The whole street gives off a young, youthful ambience that can be felt by all there. "
I guess I went at the wrong time and wrong day...,"Buzzing area full of artist and musicians should be here, not to mention street performances and bazaar... None was seen in the afternoon on a weekday. Perhaps i went at the wrong time on a wrong day..."
Don't waste your time! ,"Really depends on what you are looking for. If you are keen to do some shopping and grab something to eat, yes, why not. Then again, same old same old.... heaps of places like this in Seoul. Nothing much to do nor anything unique aroumd this area. If you are near by, stop by to see what is happening but if you are bit far away.. dont waste your time. I'd rather spend my time in somewhere else. "

Well you never know that some of them may become famous one day.... If you have teens, please make sure that you bring them to visit this place. Not only this place full of young people but also will allow them to see the life of other teens in other side of the world. It's so much fun. "
Busy Retail and Restaurant Precinct near Honngik University,Appealing greatly to younger students and tourists. Packed with people day and night. Retail outlets are cheaper than downtown Seoul and the restaurants are mostly geared to attract budget conscience diners. Great colour and atmosphere. Well worth a visit.

If you like to shop,"There are quite a number of shops, boutiques around here. We had a dinner here before to N Seoul Tower. During that day, we were stopped by the rain so we went out late in the afternoon to Ehwa and also Hongik Street so we were sort of like quite rushing. I think it's best to go early if plan to these places as there are quite a numbers of shops. boutiques around. We also stopped by at one of the cafe before we had our dinner there."
Interesting small boutique shops,"I quite like the small boutique that sells the korean style clothes, which are reasonably cheap. There are also some small cafes that sells cakes which looks yummy, but unfortunately I do not have time to try. I would certainly would like to go back there again."

Youthful buzz,"Definitely a place for the 20's/early 30's crowd, as you can witness a few street performances (dancers, singers, bands).

A crowded street and no restaurant/pub had an English menu???,Its a buzzing street with Uni students and shops. We wanted to go to eat something before we head to a pub. I am not a pork or a beef eater so I struggled to find a decent restaurant. most of the pubs do not have much food options. Most of the pubs had menus in Korean only so ordering was a problem. The streets were crowded till two am.
Cheaper food and shopping,The food and shopping here seems to be cheaper probably because it is catered to Uni Students. Best to come here late afternoon or night as most shops do not open until about noon. 
"Fun place, lots of youngsters","Fun place to be. Lots of food, drinks and cafes. Caters mostly for youngster but still a nice place to visit. "
"Hipster's dream, real rocker's nightmare","This place is great if you want cosmetics, bread, a candle, a coffee, mehh mehhh. So go to a convenience store and buy beer and get wasted and walk around. This place has become sooooo trendy that is lacks what it once was (unique) - there are many other places in Seoul that are hip. This place, to me, is good for shopping and being surrounded by commerce. Actually sad what this place has become, then again, sad what happened to music in Korea.... Bang bang bang,,, Mehhhhh. But, if you're young and trying to be cool,,,,, then yeah, go here and take a selfie. Congrats, You rule!"
"Great area, day and night","This is a very nice area which felt very safe. Due to the nearby university it is a young crowd that fills the streets, parks, bars and restaurants day and night. In the evening every inch of grass is covered with picnic blankets with youngsters eating and boozing but not been rowdy at all.I stayed in 4 different areas in Seoul and this was by far my favorite because it had such a nice vibe."
Saturday Artist Market closes at 6PM Sharp!,"If you cannot make it by 6pm to the Saturday Artist Market, do not go...We arrived at 5:30 pm and vendors were already packing up for the day...I will try to get there early next time!"

One of the hippest neighborhoods in Seoul,"This is the center of Hongdae, a big student neighborhood with tons of great clubs, indie rock, and cool bars. It is one of my favorite areas in Seoul. Hongdae is full of vibrant youth and with less of the corporate influence of Gangnam. Be warned that the median age here on a Friday night is about 22, so you might feel quite old if you are in your 30s or older and walking through!"
Where Hongdea is located,"An excellent place to stay and shop. Food, shopping and the local street culture in full force. Opens till late at night as well. "
Vibrant location!,"One of the places anyone should check out especially over the wkend! Bars, shops, cafes...you name it! great vibes! "
Great place to experience and interact with the youth of Seoul,"The street is alive all night with musicians, singers , performers, food , shopping and everything you will need to spend a fun night out in Seoul.Amazing place to spend the night dancing and interacting with new people!"
Lively,We went here on a Saturday night as we didn't have dinner and most other areas close early. This place was completely different....crowded and lively even past 1 AM
"BUZZING, CRAZY, LOUD, FUN","Just walking around this area with a cold beer from GS25 (prevalent corner shop) is enough to entertain anyone for an hour or more.Always busy in the evenings, this area is buzzing with university students and young people dancing, singing, hanging out, playing - it's super cool!We saw Korean boy bands dancing like girls and doing rehearsed routines. They were crowds and crowds of girls watching. This was a real cultural eye opener for us!There are all kinds of shops and food outlets here so you can walk around and grab stuff very easily.Other than that, ENJOY!"
Fashion and fun street,"Lot of shops selling clothing, cosmetics, shoes. Eateries local and international. Road side shows, dances being conducted by students. Tourist police post is nearby to offer help to find your way . ATM machines, medical shops nearby. Safe place. Enjoy for 2 hours. "

Awesome ,There are a hundred of shopping store and also very good restaurants so I highly recommend you to visit this place . You will like it! 
Nice Place for Shopping,Visited Hongdae for several times & have never get sick with it. A place where you can get relatively cheap clothes and nice cafe/restaurants there. You can see the different between Day & Night. Day time focus more on shopping and Night time focus more on Dinning & Pubs. I would say this is a MUST visit place if you are traveling to Seoul if you want a place which is Fun & Happening.
No baskers on a Thu night,"This is my second visit to Hongik University Street. It wasn't as exciting as it was during my last visit. Maybe it was a weekday night this time. Did not see any street baskers at night. Which was quite a disappointment. The shops looked the same as I last time. This time round, not many shops caught my attention. Nevertheless, it was still a nice experience to take a walk there in the evening. We found a very posh yet chic cafe in the area. A unique cafe with a pub on the second floor. Nice and relaxing way to rest the tired feet as well as have a nice hot cup of coffee or tea. "
"Busy, vibrant area","Worth a visit for some shopping, street food, or a bit of street entertainment! Take exit 9 from the Hongik subway station for quick access. "
Interesting Street experience,"Very interesting place to visit. Arts and cultures, street food, local attractions, merchandise and souvenirs shop. The street is vibrants and colorful, unique shops and cafés too!"
Great area,It's a big area to shop around! When you get off the metro you can see heaps of restaurants and all the shops are after the restaurants. It's a great shopping area but smaller than Myeong-dong but it's a more comfortable place to wander around.
Crowded!,"This place is extremely crowded on a weekend. But at the same time, this is where all the good food and good bargains reside. Shopping for clothes here was way cheaper than myeong dong. And there is just so much to buy. On top of that, if you are looking for cat, dog or sheep cafes, they are located in corners around here. Definitely a great place to venture around"
Amazing during day and Crowded during Night,"The birthplace of Hip-hop (or at least what the local say). You can miss Gangnam but you can't miss this place. Although the clubs in here usually looks like slums (compared to clubs in Gangnam). Just taking a walk along this street can be amazing. will come across several Street rappers, musicians."
弘大自由市場/創意市集 Hongdaeap Artmarket Freemarket,"我建議您可以周末去那玩, 根據網路上資料, 三月到十一月的周末下午,那有弘大自由市場/創意市集 ,同時距離購物區很近,是很多觀光客及韓國年輕人的聚集地, 邊逛街的同時, 您也能找到很多好吃的東西!I will suggest that you can visit there on weekend.

Besides, it is near shopping district, and you can also find nice food there! Many young people gather there. Sometimes, some artists also perform there, singing or playing instruments."
One of my favourite areas!,"I love the Hongdae area a lot, there's so much to do, great places to eat, shop and grab a coffee. And the live performances are always fun too! At night time there's also several clubs you can go to there. It's a cool area to go to with friends or alone."
Stone's throw away from where we stayed,"If you are fond of watching live performances done by youngsters while shopping, then this is the best place to visit. We have witnessed some performances here. "
youthful energy,"Crowded even on weekdays, plenty of young adults singing and dancing to showcase their talents. A lot of restaurants and cafes in the area, and shopping is more affordable. Set aside at least half a day because the area is huge."
A go to place at night!,Artsy and a shopping haven for clothing and food as well. Prices here are slightly on the lower side compare to Myeongdong.
Go there at night and you won't be deceived,This street is so lively at night that time flies so fast. You can watch many performances here from solo guitarist to 10 young people dancing on famous K-pop songs. Just add the delicious street food and some shops to spend your money and you will have a wonderful night!
Might be the best area in Seoul for stay and chill out.,"Great&cool area ,food & Drink more reasonable.The park along the way from subway to residence is nice for sit and drink."
Artística street!,"I found a lot of tons of fun here!! you can see many free musical shows! go to eat, dance, drink, buy clothes anything that you want you will find here! always it's crowed and always you will find something to do!"
Perfect for youngsters,"When you visit Seoul, Hongdea is a MUST if you're young, fun and love shopping. It's very busy and lovely in the weekend and at nights. You should go to these streets on Afternoon, there was many many street vendors ̣ walking streets , to sell clothes, souvernirs, cosmetics..... those streets are similar to Myeongdong but the price was cheaper than M cause this is students's areas. And at night, there was thoundsands of club open. It was fun, loud music, youngster hanging out.... just bring a very-seoul atmosphere. There was a FREE MARKET on Saturday afternoon where fine arts students can sell and promote their work arts. It was a small but amazing free market. Each students have their own style and unique products to sell ̣ from Drawing Portrait to Cards, Ceramic products ... it's so lovely to see. There were also some streets performance. Free Market is very near to Honggik Uni. It was not just a student area, but for me, it's a ""most-seoul"" street . You definitely shoul visit this area. And prepare to walk A LOT cause it's very large area."
do your shopping there!,"there's plenty to shop there, and the clothes are cheap! try the famous tiramisu ice cream - kiss the tiramisu, its reallyyyy good! get into the alleys where you'll find alot of restaurants, and they are less noisy as compared to the other restaurants near the main road."
Suggest to all travelers in their 20s,"My favorite place to be in summer! So many street performers, students gathering in the park and talking while having a drink from 7-eleven! And it doesn't require any big wallet to be able to meet new people and have a good time! "
Trendiest Young area of Seoul,"Here is where college nightlife happens. Listen to musicians on the street, try some food at the food stalls, go shopping, visit a drinking tent, then finish the night with clubbing. This place doesn't shut down until 6am. Highly recommended for young travelers who want to party with Koreans. "
Best shopping!!,There are lots of little boutique clothing shops with relatively inexpensive Korean Fashion! I liked this place more than other shopping areas like Myeong Dong. Great food in the area as well :)
Crowded on a Weekend but fun,We went there on a Saturday afternoon and the streets are filled with aspiring artists showcasing their talents. It was a place worth visiting. Great place to shop for cheap clothes and accessories. 
Interesting place,"A lot of people come here. You can feel the energy of young people. They are doing some activity likes singing, dancing and else. "
We could feel the energy and enthusiasm from young people,"This time, we found Yunnamdong in Hongdae area very attractive.There is an old train track park, and most buildings were new but very unique atmosphere. It was a cool place. "
Hongik Free Market,"Just across the university, there is a small park where every weekend, there will be stalls set up by students selling their handicrafts, you can get your portraits drawn by students at a minimum fee too. "

Come feels the vibe,"Hongik Univ, Hongdae is where you come and see how local youngster lives.This place is full of tasty restaurant, street shows, and trendy shopping places.Night life(Night club, Pub) is recommended"
Shop + Eat,"I spent 2 days there just walk around and shop, you definitely will find some cheap and cool stuff there. Clothes and accessories are cheap and nice. Food there are worth trying too, very delicious. "
My favorite place!,"Hongdae is one of my favorite place when I went to South Korea. There are hundreds/thousands of restaurants and stores. This is a very BUSY street, lots of things going on, and there are street performers too, usually dancing to K-Pop. "
Must try the Korean Desert Cafe,Korean Desert cafe is really busy with local students sharing ice deserts.Thought we would try a mango one between the three of us not realising it's very common for groups to share.
"Eat, shop and must try is Issac Toast",Good place to shop and eat. Hip and vibrant area with trendy food and fashion. The must try food is the Issac Toast right at the entrance of Hongik University. Really tasty sandwiches and many options to choose from.
On of the ultimate hangout places for young locals,"Hongdae is definitely THE place to be if you're a young visitor, at night the place comes to life with endless shops and restaurant and young street performers. Super recommended!"
Youthful Shopping Vibes!,"We went there on the Subway to Hongik Station. There are 3 sections of the shopping streets. Get a map at the tourist office or from the friendly Korean Guides on the main street. Lots of shops selling clothes, accessories, skincare and some branded retail shops like New Balance. Restaurants and cafes lined the streets. Youthful vibes. Cool place to hangout and enjoy the vibes!"
Slice of university life in Seoul,"We visited Hongik university street on a Saturday afternoon. It was bubbling with life. Performers were everywhere - K-Pop dancing, freestyle dancing, buskers with guitars, funny guys.... Stopped and watched this fantastic fingerstyle guitarist show his chops... There was lots of energy and talent on display. The area was lined with coffee joints, food joints, beer and chicken places, and stalls selling street food. Lots of shops clothing, bags, footwear, accessories and cosmetics. Prices were generally reasonable. Crowds started building up as the afternoon wore on and by evening it was so packed that there was a human traffic jam climbing up the stairs to get out of the metro to the street level. Interesting place to visit, to feel some of the energy and creativity of young Korea."
Vibrant hub of shopping and eating,"This place is a hangout for locals and tourists alike. Loads of cafes, BBQ restaurants, clothes and makeup stores, and the like. But the one thing that stood out for me was the busking and dancing that occurred at night, in the middle of the mass of shops. That is not usual, and I enjoyed seeing young talents giving their shot out in the streets for attention."
Wonderful place!,"We went there in the evening to eat some Korean barbeque. The street was beautiful with their traditional designed roof. Along the streets there are food shops. Many offers seafood and beef barbeque. At night, there are attractions on the street where some groups of people danced or sang with people watching. "
Fashion shopping,This place was so much better than Myeongdong Shopping Street which was so flooded with rowdy tourist and sales assistants. For those looking for trendy stuffs this will be a better place to shop with leisure without pressure and stress.
Best Street Shopping and Food in Seoul!!!,Cheap goods and lots of options to purchase souvenirs and clothings. Nice view and architecture at EWHA University!
Fun Place to Wander,"This is my favorite place to just wander by myself in Seoul. Lots of people playing music, selling handmade items, small shops, etc. "
Lots of young people. Very vibrant!!,"Also known as Hongdae. This is the equivalent of Harajuku for Seoul. Lots of young people, hip shops, young people performing on the streets, university students having a party and drinking in the park. A very nice place to spend your friday or Saturday night. There are some really nice pubs and restaurants and cafes too. Last Friday of each month is club night and you can go to all the clubs with one pass. I'm too old for that though but I still really enjoy a good night at Hongdae - had dinner at a korean bbq restaurant, went for a drink and ended the night at a rooftop café. "
For the young at heart,"A street for all ages, with clubs and street performances at night, shopping and cafes in the day. Great place for dessert as well. "
Fun spot if you're in your 18-20s ,"Spent a lot of time here during my trip to Seoul because there was always something to do here. Street performers, clubs, hookah bar, shopping, eating...there are lots of people here and they tend to be in the younger crowd. Worth checking out."
Cool street music + Hipster cafes,"I remember having yummy soju, yummy fried chicken. Bought my new balance shoes too =) Weekdays are filled with students, and this place is SWARMED during weekends. "
Very big place so you need to plan ahead.,"Hongik University is one of the best art school in Korea so you'll find many creative, hand made merchandise here. Many shops and street performers so you need to plan ahead as you can end up in wrong place easily. Steret food, shopping, drinking, meet up, etc.."
Ok,Well it wasn't interesting for me there wasn't that much of shop or new experience it's just a street with some shops not that good too it's expensive without quality. We thought we'll see a performance but there isn't any just some drunk couple here and there 
Youngsters paradise.,"Very trendy among youngster. A lot of shop selling clothing, accessorise and contact lenses. Socks are cheap m 1 pair for 1000won. Very crowded on weekend. "
Cool area during the day and at night,I really like Hongdae and it's quite a big area with many shops and places to eat / drink. Our hostel was here so we spent at least some time every night walking around.
"Sights, sounds and shopping!","If you have teenagers in your group then definitely come here! We bought many things here and there is also a Sunday market at the park.

There is even a world class churro stall!"
A place for youngsters,"Basically this area is conquered by the youngsterssss. Easily find foods. A good place for night life. Shopping wise, nt as much as ewha univ. area."
3 Day Trip,"Amazing stop. Nothing really opens till 12pm closing round 1-2am. Street food is a must (1-2k Krw), egg bread and churros high on any list. Loads off coffee houses, cake places and macaroon sales outlets ! Worth a long afternoon / evening walk to the booming bars... "
Vibrant Streets,- was staying at 1 of the Guesthouse in this area & nvr regret- everything is so convenience &- within walking distance to the Hongik University Subway Station but aware of the nearest Gate- nearby Sinchon another place to shop around ••
Crowded and dirty streets,"This place is crowded with young people who even block some roads with their group dance challenges and what not. The streets are dirty from littering. I would recommend this to people looking for nightlife, some alcohol, food and mingling with the young locals."
"lovely street busking every night, full of new discoveries","has street buskers who sing, rap, play instruments which sometimes form large crowds. one area is full of small boutiques for female clothing and the adjacent area on the same street is full of fried chicken restaurant/pubs, korean bbq places and jokbal or pigs feet restaurants and also korean pancake and fritter (jeon) places. Endless cafes in the area and now Bershka, New Balance MCM Forever 21 and H&M are also there as well as local clothing chain SPAO."
Good vibe & ambience,"I found my favorite band T-shirts here :)Korean culinary, fashion, beauty products and souvenirs are easily found here.Since it is a university area, so the prices aren't so expensive.Don't be hesitated to haggle :)Show your skills, buddy.Cheap snacks and food are available also here, especially when it is summer..a Korean dessert should be an oasis in afternoon haha.3 money changers (if I'm correct) & a tourist information centre are situated in this street also.City tour bus are easily found in it's stop area. You can join the program for a well-planned hopping."

","Hongdae is where all the food stalls, dessert cafes and restaurants from friend chicken, korean bbq and pork soup are all delicious~ on weekend evening some people perform on the streets fron music, dance and more, Also good for some shopping along the streets. Good place for hangout with friends especially weekend nightNote: The subway station can be fully packed esp exit 9 on busy hours esp weekend! If this happen i will recommend to find other exit with probably less people on stairs. "
Place for young peoples,You can find many trending fashion for young peoples and a lot of restaurant nearby at this place. Singing performance also able to find here.
"Food, Shops, Bars, Clubs.","Get off at Hongik Uni Station, Exit 9. Then turn left in to the street. Turn right to get into the main walking street then there you go, find what you looking for.

There are many trendy fashion stores. There is an inexpensive shoe store by exit 1 of the subway. The area is targeted for young people, so it is trendy and not expensive for good food and clothing. Hello Kitty Cafe is in the area."
Nice food there,"I went there last time and there's lot of nice restaurants around that area. For me, that area is not so special, just the food because it's university area so you have nothing to do there"
Happy shopping and dining experience at Hongik University Street,"There are a lot of shops selling clothing, accessories, cosmetics targeted for young people mainly but the price of goods is affordable. There are many cafes and restaurants in this area, you can easily spend 1/2 day at Hongik University Street."
"Great food, great crowd",You can find all kinds of interesting food on this street. Soak in the atmosphere and wish you were a student again!
was soho for seoul,"it was very artistic, and fashionable street. about 3 years a go, now it just has big companies, cosmetics, starbucks, coffee bean, donuts and so on. you may drink all night long in here until sun rise up. but near here is quite expensive."
Economical place to go for shopping and food,I stayed nearby during my Korea trip. We went there almost everyday. There are many cheap and nice food and shopping. Very crowded during weekend. Trick eye museum and Diaso are also there. 
Love this area!,Always nice if u have nothing to do to walk around this area. Especially during the evening time you can find street entertainment everywhere!
Fascinating place to walk,"Hongik University Street or Hongdae is the place where Korean youth hanging-out at night. You could see they sing a song with guitar, or doing a group of energetic breakdance on the street. The street is very close to Hongik University, where Korean youth gathering during night, in unique cafes, art markets, fashion shops and gourmet eateries.This place with its street performance always packed with people will give you a must-go place to experience the Hongdae area."

great area,"i booked my hostel in this area.close to metro station, the area is full of korean and westren restaurants bars coffee shops and street food.you can find there a lot of fashion stores, cinema, arcade and many more.nice and cool atmosphere to meet the locals"
"Happening place, crowded","If you want a place that is busy every time, this is the best place to go. Along the way you can find accessories, clothes, foods, etc. The price is cheap, and a lot of varieties. You can find park around here.One of the attraction around this place is Hello Kitty Cafe. "
Shopping,"Shopping area. Mainly on clothes and accessories. This area is consider big where you need to do a lot of walking, that shouldn't be a problem for people that love shopping. Price is consider on the lower side, quality is good. There are restaurants around but not as many compare to Myeongdong. "
Happening night lfie,"If you're looking for night life, this street is for you. There are loads of cafe, restaurants, fashion boutiques and much more. It's crowded with people, mostly with young people seeing the university is nearby. Come here and unwind after a long day"
Nightlife,"Recommended for those who want a nightlife.. Happening.. full of cafes, clothing stores.. local musician also.. Nice place to hangout"
Must do at night,"Very busy area, without being too crowded, even at night which is the best time to get there. Lots of food, artsy shops, vintage shops also. Very nice !"
Cool place for cool people,"Small little streets full with cafes, restaurants, and shops. It is fun to walk here as you can see a lot of collage students walking pass by."

A happening place in Seoul,This is a very lively part of Seoul and there's a lot of energy in the atmosphere. The crowd is mainly young people although there are also other people of the older age group. One can shop for anything you want and find almost any type of food you want. Just the energy around makes this place a very vibrant place to hang around.
A street filled with performers,"I think Hongae is a lively place filled with places to eat, shop and watch.If you go to Hongae, it's so hard to decided where to eat because there's so many to choose from and I love the fact that they sell so many pretty and affordable clothes!(By the way, when I go to Hongae, I always stop by the restaurant, Yu Ga Nae. It had super delicious stuff! I recommend you guys to go there one time!) But what's best of all is the performers.If you go to Hongae, the streets are filled with performers. People dang, since, cheer, and sometimes they even do magic tricks. Oh, and for the Karaoke lovers- at the end of the street, you'll find Soo-Noraebang.They have rooms for one people, two people and groups. If you're there and have and some time to kill, I recommend you going there! Anyways, Hongdae is a lovely, lively place and I hope the people who read this review get to go there!"
Do visit in the night and not in the day time,I have visited Korea 4th time and this is the 1st time I visited Hongik during the day time. My feedback... DO NOT visit is the daytime as there is not so lively compared to the night. There is more activities in the night and the place is more lively.
my first choice place to stay,"stayed in hongdae again during my recent trip to seoul. It will be my first choice district to stay during a holiday cos of the convenience that it's connected to the AREX line and subway line 2. Many street food, shops, restaurants, cafes to keep you busy till late nights. The place can be very crowded as it is a university district but I recommend it cos of the convenience, cheap street food, countless cafes and the stores don't close that early. my friend who travelled with me was visiting seoul for the first time and she also loved the area that she would choose to stay in hongdae district if she goes to seoul again :) for shopping/eating/cafehopping/clubbing wise, you can easily spend an entire day here. oh yes, there are street performances as well. the free market only takes place in the non-winter seasons."
Saw the nutcracker,The wife and I spent the day and saw the musical the nut cracker for the holidays. It was a really good production and was able to hold my attention.
Street food! Street performances! Free hugs!,"Hongdae is a vibrant, young community and in this particular street, everything comes alive as the sun sets. Surrounded by shops, restaurants, cafes, cinemas and you name it, the street itself becomes slowly filled with stalls selling popular street food, young entrepreneurs come here to show off their wares while wannabe-artists performing on the street try to appeal to passer-bys with their dance and songs and then there are random guys who stand around holding quirky signs that read, ""Hug me if you want to grow taller! =P""Definitely the place to be if you don't have a lot of money to spend but just want a fun and chill night out with friends, new or old! Come along and surprise yourself with what you get up to!"
Feeling Young when visit!!,Spent a few hours there and already feeling young!! hahaha it was a nice experience especially on the weekend as there are a lot of performance and street food is also not bad. Clothes are a little on the young side so unless you are buying for a teenage there is nothing to buy..
Try the BBQ restaurants,Cheap BBQ restaurant along the street. tried BBQ chicken & chees porn ribs. Suitable for young people.
Youthful happiness,"Stepping out of the Hongik University station, this destination is filled with energy. If you are into the newest spots for shopping clothes, art, and other memorabilia, visit this place. I had the delight of going through its streets full of entertainers, dancers, and young artists. I was able to witness tv cameras featuring the arts scene in the district. Take home a trinket not found elsewhere, or a painting. You might be surprised how cheap some these works can be.There are a lot of restaurants catered for the youth. But mire interesting are the street food that lined its streets. Try the chciken on the streets, or yogurt and ice cream with custard. This is a trendy place as well, but not the elitist type, but more of a young and artsy type. A definite visit for the young and young at heart."
Another shopping paradise,"Hongik University Street is yet another shopping paradise. With fewer selection on beauty products, guys will be able to find more things over here."
All that you can feel is Happiness!,This place is truly a must must visit for you in 15s++ ans 20s++! The strong youth spirit is all that you can feel from Hongdae. Try to come to this place on Saturday night because there are many street performer which surprisingly really really good. And the most interesting thing is that the audiences appreciate the performers so much that they cheer hard for them. Seeing this surely can make you happy right? You can find many good food with affordable price her because this is a university area. There are many stores as well as street vendor selling food and clothes in this street. Just walk into random alley and explore this area because you'll be surprised with what you find.
Youthful Vitality,"It feels like just about every weekend I find myself venturing around Hongdae. There are lots of restaurants, bars, lounges, clubs and the best part is that they are all at an affordable price. The nightlife is real."
Hip place to hangout,This is a fun place to visit. This place is not only for young people but there is something for everybody. Plenty of shopping and street food. We had the tiramisu ice cream and found it to be very refreshing. The Kyochon fried chicken is also worth trying.
Very vibrant and lively place,"We stayed at an apartment above the Hongik University Station. The Hong dae shopping street was just a short 5 mins away. And what a interesting place it was!Rows and rows of stores selling cosmetics, clothing, toys and restaurants line up the entire place. And the crowds seem never ending, even when near midnight and its freezing cold outside.There are also lines of street stalls selling street foods; Korean youths performing dances and singing live. Coupled with the crowds, it just makes the entire place so vibrant and lively!Definitely worth a visit even if you are not staying in Hongdae."
Youthful and Lively,Street full of eateries and watering holes. Youthful and energetic crowd gives you an optimistic vibe about the place.
One of the best things to check out in Seoul!,"This area is full of very interesting things to catch. It's it's not too cold or raining at night there will be performances, drinking, dancing and even sometimes silent discos. In the warmer months in the early to late afternoon there is a craft market, I just love to have brunch nearby and then take a stroll through the market. "
Shopping spree,Hongdae area is vibrant as it is where the Hongik University students hangout. This area has many unique shopping finds as opposed to the big brand name fashion goods. The vibe here is different and unique. A must-visit.
Hear the live music and feel the youth,This place is good to listen music and many artists are there. It is also good place for drinking in the evening.
Coolest part of Hongdae!,"I love this place. It's my favourite part of Seoul. Great live music, great street performers (usually students), very entertaining, and a great place to drink and meet other travelers. "
Youth street,"A place with lots of young people, youngster performing such as dancing , singing in group etc . Lots of eateries nearby and trick eye museum is also just round the corner."
Catch busking performance here,This is the place for youngsters. every night you can find a lot of students/young people busking or do a performance here. this place is very lively even after midnite as is near university area. a lot of street food vendors can be found here as well. 
Youthful feelings everywhere!!,"This place has everything!! Cozy cafes and good restaurants, various shops and street vendors, and most importantly all kinds of art performance by young inspiring artists. I recommend to visit this street at afternoon or night as those were the times where this street is truly alive"
The street performers tho,"Super fun dynamic young area: great for shopping because everything is so compact, eating because there are sooooo many amazing restaurants to chose from. Plus, there are cute street performers everywhere singing and dancing and making shows! If you're in Seoul, no matter what, go for a drinking night out on this street, you will not regret it!"
"Hectic, raucous, neon, noisy, brilliant!","My Korean-English friend told me that this area was where she mostly hung out on her trips to visit family in Seoul, so I had it on my must-visit list. I actually found myself here by accident the first time since I'd come to visit a nearby cafe and then realised where I was - and it was a Saturday night which made it even better.The place was absolutely heaving with what felt like every 20-something in Seoul. I stumbled across a mass swing dance performance and later that night saw bands and different types of dances scattered throughout. Some were rather good!Go and get lost down the back streets. Don't keep an eye on your map, just turn down every tiny alleyway and be astonished and delighted by what you find: a cool little cafe, an dessert parlour, a bulgogi restaurant, yet another skincare shop, hipster accessories, you name it . . . Sure, this place is hipster and young but I'm 30 and wasn't wearing any makeup but didn't feel at all out of place.I ended up migrating back here several times during my stay in Seoul and found it just as much fun during the day, albeit easier to navigate, but always enjoyable just to wander around at night. So long as you're happy amongst crowds of people and don't have a particular goal in mind, you'll have a great evening here, regardless of where you end up."
A lively night for the youngs.,Been there in the evening. There's lot of street performance along the walking street by the university student (?). Good place to hang out in the evening.
Funky for the young...,"The neighborhood feels very funky and colourful, mainly targetted at the young.Worth spending some time to walk around. "
Fun and lively,You will never get bored here as there are an infinite number of places to see and do here and you can buy stuff and watch performances too!
Great nightlife filled with street performers,"I loved walking around Hongdae during night time and seeing the town come to life. There are street performers galore, ranging from musicians to dancers and street games. It's great to see the interaction between the street performers and the crowds and really love the vibe around this area!"
"Vibrant,fun street","I really like Hongdae street.It is one of the best street ever in my Korean trip.I love all the bustling,fun,entertaining music.I feel ALIVE.I like street that has a lot of street performance eg :music.That street has a lot of talented musicians.The street has a lot of shops.There are some quiet streets.But i perfer the noisy street.With all the live talented street peformance The only thing I disliked is being squeezed when going out of the subway station exit."
Seoul Flavour,Hongdae was my favorite part of Seoul and wandering around here at night was a treat for the senses. Sadly the weather killed my only Friday night in Seoul but lots to see here at anytime. Mainly a younger crowd but really fun and accepting. Not as many tourists as Itaewon/Gangnam/Noksapyeong either so a great place to mix with Koreans. 
Young atmosphere,"Definitely a must see when you are in Seoul. There are a lot of interesting cafes and the overall vibe that you get from the area is pretty awesome. We spent hours walking around and stumbled upon several street performers, which was pretty awesome. There are plenty of food options to choose from and a range of option of things to do. From a leisurely stroll to all-night clubbing, Hongik has it all and everything in between. "
perfect stop for teenagers,"Place for good food, pub and bar and perfect for night life party. many 24 hrs coffee shop, really recommend for teenagers with nightlife preference. "
Exciting vibrant place,"We were there last night from Gangnam, enjoyed the place, full of life, seriously very good street buskers belting out sentimental k pop songs. It's the place for the young ones but I did not enjoy it too. Plenty of small shops selling clothing and with the weather entering Winter, you can find most of your needs here. I even managed to shop for a Lennon/Gandhi look alike frame, nice but hardly cheap. "
Music and youth culture,"If you are looking for an unintimidating area to experience the youth culture in South Korea, ""Hongdae"" is the area to be. Enjoy live music (street-busking), dancing, and other forms of entertainment as you walk down the busy streets filled with young students, couples, and tourist alike. There also isn't a shortage of bars, restaurants, and little shops for you to check out. If you do go out, remember that subway stations are closed at midnight so do opt for a taxi (safe and rather inexpensive). "
young and vibrant,love this place..young and vibrant and trendy. Food is nice here. There are also many cafes. Good fashion for men clothing too. 
Artsy side of Seoul,"Went there on a Saturday where there was their ""free market"". Many interesting and artsy items to buy- most handmade by the sellers themselves! Lovely vibes of this university town with much to do and see."
Youngster Street,"Hongdae is a good place for shopping and eating. This place is just above the Hongik University station. The street here are selling cheap (like 10,000 won) and affordable clothes, bags etc. There are also many restaurants and cafes here. I simply love shopping and eating here. MUST visit."
Young at heart street,"Have everything to enjoy.street food, valued local fashion,beer,pub, live show by the students. you can enjoy here all night. "
Buzzing area full of youth,"Full of young people/students, shops and restaurants. A nice area for hanging out. There were also some stalls/tents on the streets selling various goods"
Vibrant! Splendid!,"My favorite place in Korea. I stayed around this region and it made me wonder if this place ever sleep! every single time i visit/walk pass this place, be it during the day or late night (abt 1am-ish), there are always alot of people around as though there is a huge function happening! (i checked, nope, no special program, its just how this place is like.) definitely one of the most vibrant and youthful place in Korea. if you need shopping, food, drinks, performance etc etc.. you name it you pretty much can get everything here! (except if you are seeking luxurious products. its a UNIVERSITY zone, so can't be expecting students to be able to afford such things, as least not yet.) "
Lively night live dance performance. Very refreshing and participating for both performers and audiences. Thumbs Up!,"Even though it was winter and freezing cold, the performers were very entertaining and we were able to withstand the cold and had so much fun thru the night. "
Very alive place,"Lots of shops, lots of street food, lots of restaurants, performing people on the street. But it is so CROWDED! But u can find pretty much everything here."
Buzzing streets!!! ,"Such a buzzing area!!! So alive, young, awesome. There is an amazing street dance group that usually perform in the evenings by the big red bus close to exit 8 of Sinchon station. It's like a male Beyoncé and her crew :) Lots of places to eat, lots of interesting shops and cafes. Wonder around in the evening "
Soooo crowded,"Super crowded.many street performers,from solo guitar performer,dance group,rappers,comedy skit,etc.Many food restaurants & coffee shops,cosmetics stores,etcUnfortunately,you can see trashes here and there.kinda dirty.."
For the young and young at heart!,"Hongdae is known for the arts, and you'll find buskers, street performers and musicians during a visit there. There are various Korean singers/bands who have become famous by performing in this area. Come here if you like food (usually cheaper than other areas because it's catered to the college students), beer, clubbing, and cheap clothes! Clothes are usually the latest trends and can be had for a good price. Lots of stuff for the girls as well as the guys! Had really good fried chicken, Korean noodles, burgers and a BBQ meal here as well. Prices are affordable and there is a wide variety of options available for the picky eater. Fast food is available (TacoBell, etc) and Korean beauty outlets here seem to have better deals than at Myeongdong (speaking from personal experience). Lots of quirky things to see and do (Trick Eye Museum, a handful of cat cafes), cheap opticians. Difficult to find a money changer though, so get your currency converted to Korean Won before paying a visit to Hongdae! "
Lots of activities and shops in the area!,A very happening area! Lots of activities and shops and food and street performers. Definitely worth a visit. Many people had recommended staying in this area but I only went for an afternoon. Enjoyed the experience and would definitely go back again.
College Life,"Do you wonder what university students do during their spare time in Seoul? Look no further than Hongik University Street. Here there are live musicians and street performers, most of which are university students from Hongik University. This little street gives you a glimpse into the lives of university students. When they aren't studying for exams, much like regular students, the students at Hongik University like to relax and hang out. Many of the students you will see on the street will be majoring in business management, but you can see that they have other ways of expressing themselves. Don't be surprised if English Major students try to strike up a conversation with you. They can tell you the best places to eat and shop, but be patient sometimes they will not be able to understand you, especially if you have a thick accent. Speak slowly and clearly."
A lively place to visit no matter which season,This place has it all from shopping to eating to street performance to night life. I love to shop here and eat at the cafes. 1 day is not enough for me. 
Tons of creative street vendors!,"The park near Hongik are filled with vendors on the weekend as well as live music performers and free giveaways. I came here to check out the local crafts and to purchase some souvenirs. All the vendors were creative and featured different merchandise. If you like something, make sure you buy it then and there because they might not be back the next day. "
Definitely don't miss!,"Lots of people flooding the streets of Hongik university area, lots of musicians, and artists, and great happy atmosphere! Don't skip it!"
Worthy to go if having time,"A hot spot loved by local young people. Nightlife is always there. Lots of restaurants and cafes. Sometimes, there are street performers."
Busy and young fashion,"Full of tourists and locals. The food, shops and fashion are similar in the shopping places that we went, the prices are about the same and some even more expensive. Not too sure, why this place is so popular? Maybe this is the hangout spot for the young ppl. Nothing special"
Unique Place,"Hongik University is known for its youthful ambience and there are unique cafes, fashion shops, gourmet eateries. No wonder the place is a popular hang-out."
Hongik University Street,This is a trendy street near Hongik University. There are streets like these all over Seoul. Weekends are usually packed with tourists and young people. There are plenty of small shops and restaurants to suit everyone. You'll see street performances all day on weekends. NIght time is a serious car scene. 
cool spot,this area very crowded every night. many people hangouts in here. you can shopping or chit chat at cafe in hongik street
Another Street,"There are a ton of theme sealed streets throughout Seoul, do not let them distract you from the bigger sites though; yes some of them are interesting and beautiful women hang out there but if you are strapped for time, it is essential you stick to the bigger, main goals first and spoil yourself with lost secrets later.The coffee shops and easy paced life is nice for a Sunday stroll."
Shopping!!,"Shopping, shopping and Shopping. you'll see lots of students in this street. Not really explore through this place as the time is limited. "
Fun and busy,Lots of activity and stuff going on. Many restaurants and bars to check out. Definitely a place for night life
Excellent restaurants and interesting shops,"There are many famous restaurants and interesting shops. I like this place more than other famous places because most restaurants and shops in this place are reasonably priced. When I want to eat delicious food, I visit this place even though I don't live nearby here."
Shpping,"Good to shop here, prices very reasonable, very accessible, should bargain a little... But all in all peoplr are reasonable..."
Average Attraction,The street has lots of sacks and jewelry stores. But you can find most of the items in other shopping places. It also has lots of stores for younger adults but I am not sure about the quality or prices. I did not see anything tempting. I would only visit if I have more than 7 days in Seoul.
Hip & Chic Street,It's a nice street to walk around especially weekend. A lot of hip & chic stuffs to see & buy. Tons of cafe and street food to taste. On Sat & Sun at 'Playground' (In front of Hongik University) will have free market.
Trendy and vibrant,"Universities are supposed to be great serious higher institutions of learning and research but it appears to be the culture here in South Korea as well as in Taiwan to inject the youthful, trendy and vibrant street shopping dynamism into the atmosphere of sobriety that usually characterized that of the `ivory towers'. You hardly find such mega trendy shops right at the entrance of our National University of Singapore (NUS) or at the Nanyang Technological Institute of Singapore (NTU). But I would think that such close proximity to entertainment outlets and shopping malls would definitely help to reduce the stresses and anxieties over examinations. We stayed at BoA Guesthouse which was within walking distance from Hongik University. On our last day, we took a walk around the shopping areas of the University. We went into a spa and relax ourselves for about 2 hours before wandering around the many shops and cafes. It was fascinating to see students hang out in the many eateries, busking activities, performance and arts galleries at almost every corner of the street. Even some of the walls were painted with arts. The adjourning area outside the campus looks like an extended area for their student activities and it brings vibrancy and dynamism to the whole street. I also observed that the shops and entertainment outlets engaged the students to run their businesses on a part-time basis. Many of the counter staff at the BoA Guesthouse where we stayed were actually manned by Hongik University students who worked there on a part time basis. At night, the weather was cold. We went to a restaurant along Hongik Street to have our dinner. It was warm inside the restaurant brightened by the incandescent lamps. The food resembled our `Yong Tau Foo' (fish beancurd) in Singapore and was deliciously cooked to our appetite. We were the only `senior citizens' in the restaurant as all the other customers were young undergraduate students from Hongik University. After the dinner, we had a relaxed walk in the cold weather looking at some of the street performances.  Nice ambience, nice food, trendy and vibrant environment."
U-town shopping!,Go here for cheap finds! There are plenty of shops catering to the university students and you can always find a steal!
Great experience!,"If you want a real taste of what Seoul is like, you should definitely check this place out. There are so many different (cheap) shops, restaurants, and things to do. We stayed in this area and would definitely do it again! Great time!"
Student Hangout,"Good student vibe, with performers and the usual shopping and eating. I ended up there by accident and it turned out to be a nice end to a good night out."
A perfect place to hang out on a friday night,"Pretty cool place! It has lots of indie shopping stores, restaurants and bars. A perfect place for hanging out on a Friday night. "
Offers what malls cannot offer,Many nice little shops and lots of street food to try! Plus variety of cuisines- saw long queues lined up in front of most restaurants !! 
"Walk, Shop, Eat and Hang Out at Hongdae","A lot of hang out places, shops and good restaurants. Nice to walk and shop and eat. I feel younger walking around these area with a lot of students around and good places to eat and hangout with friends :)"
Very relaxed location ,"A lot of shops, cafe, restaurants, street arts around Hongkik Uiversity stations. Information provides local maps and brochures of this area. Also they are happy to help out the information what you want to do and see at this area. I had a very good midday walk around. "
Trendy District,"Headed over to Hongik University Street to see the much famed street markets, but was quite a disappointment due to the large number of stalls selling china made goods. The food stalls in the area however, were very good, with fantastic food being offered at economical prices. "
Really cool!,The street is just wow! So lively with so many street performance. Cafes and restaurants are too many and I could hardly resist to stop and have a glimpse on their menu. Haha. Highly recommended for those who want to go shopping and see the Korean youths fashion style. We also went to the Trick Eye Museum.
Hongdae,"A great place by both day and night! During the day it's a great place to shop, and night it's a great place to catch live music or dance. "
My favourite place in Seoul,I'm in love with these vibrant streets days and nights. Wonderful shop to buy student-price clothes. Nice restaurants. Nice bars. Lovely street performance. The vibe is simply great!
Fun place to shop around or get drinks,It's a fun place to go to get a younger feel for a Seoul destination. Lots of coffee places and street food. 
Good place to shop & eat,We actually went to Hongik area to visit a hair salon. It was a busy place with lots of shops & eating places. There were also alot of street vendors selling all kinds of Korean street food. Things are slightly cheaper as compared to Myeongdong. Definitely a place that you must visit when you are in Seoul.
"Cool, quirky and fun","Has a nice market outside with delicious street food. Get to see lots of activities singing, random street artists, art etc and the trendy part of the city"
Trendy street,"shopping and eateries ... womens university nearby, great bars and disco's or dancing areas... younger crowd."
Love this area!,We came here on a Sat and it was very crowded. Shopping was very good here and there were a lot of shops to browse in. Interesting arts and performers around the area. There is also a very pretty Hello Kitty cafe and Kyochon Chicken is a must eat if you are in this area.
Young and fun.,"Fun, interesting, gorgeous people and great restaurants. Easy to hang out here jumping from coffee shop to barbecue restaurant to boutique to bar. "
Amazing atmosphere ,It's one of the best places to go in seoul. You can buy clothes and all other crazy stuffs. Public artists performance all together and create a perfect atmosphere

Vibrant and Lively,"Came here on my first day to Seoul. After hearing a fair bit about this University town at Hongdae, I thought it'll be worth to visit.This town is filled with youth taking a break from their hectic studies to come and eat, drink and even perform. There are also plenty of shops from H&M to your local korean brands.Walking around, you may be lucky to catch great street performers who most likely come from performing arts or the music field. Who knows, perhaps you may catch the nect K-pop idol in action."
Vibrant college area,"There are a ton of food and shopping options here along with pop-up singing and dancing performances on the street. There will be a lot of people here at night so you should be comfortable with crowds. We had BBQ and dessert, 2 common Korean meals."
good for nightlife but not myeongdong good,"if you are staying in the area, then this is a fun place to visit at night with a very vibrant young crowd of college students and toursits. lots places to eat and shop at, but it's not as happening as myeongdong area. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here but it was fun while we were here."
