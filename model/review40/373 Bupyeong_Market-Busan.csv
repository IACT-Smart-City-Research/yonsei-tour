Nice Night Market with Many Food Choices,"Visiting Bupyeong Market is a great idea to be able to see & taste the amazing street food in Busan. The night market had many people but not that crowded that you still can walk comfortably. The food choices ranges from caramelized fruits to many kinds of skewers, pancakes & special delicacies that are specialties of Busan. A perfect place where you could experience Busan's food culture. There are also many bars & restaurants that offer affordable food & drinks."
"Great market, especially with the night food market","Great experience. Large open market with merchandise, fruits, fish, vegys and lots of restaurants. At night (after 7 or 7:30, depending on the day) some booths close down and dozens of carts are rolled out into the streets with specialty foods. The crowds become incredibly large and it is difficult to walk around. Some booths seem to have followers as the lines are long as the carts setup and get the first food prepared. Amazing experience."
night market,it's a bit crowded but worth going. got to try local food and fusion dishes. l love korean street food!
Nice Night Market,"Found this market when looking for a night market that was in walking distance of our hotel. There was a good selection of food carts selling a variety of food, and some little restaurants and stalls as well. The carts were all nice and clean and the people working were generally really friendly and not pushy. Great place to go if you want to satisfy a junk food craving (lots of deep fried things and a couple places selling dessert like things like ice cream or candy), but also some sea food carts too, like crab served in its shell and stuff. It was a little chilly while we were there, but there was a good amount of people there, not too busy though. If you keep going up past all the food carts, you will come into lots of little bars and restaurants too. There are some cool looking bars there if you want to sit on the street and people watch. If you're in the neighborhood and enjoy night markets, this was worth checking out, but I wouldn't go too far out of my way to come here."
Awesome,Chanced upon this market when wondering around in the area. Loved it! It was huge. With huge offerings of food and merchandise. Personally I find this market to be very authentic. Seems more locals come here than foreigners. Can get some local made products which are value for money. I would come back again if I am back in Busan. 
You can eat and drink and shop...,"Lumch is apparently available for all price classes. So its accessible by mainly average Korean people. Fish looked yummy, and priced inside fishmarket places!"
Food central,Bupyeong Market is just one of the many markets in Busan central area- many people gather to have their meals here. I found a great korean fried chicken stall and by far the crunchiest on the outside and most juiciest on the inside-minus the grease. Close to this market is the Gukje market and the Jagalchi fish market. Do take time to explore! 
Yum,"We walked for hours and tried to eat as diverse as we could. Finally tried the silkworms, very tasty especially with beer :). Food was great, shopping was good too."
Eating or Shopping ��!,"Think this is more the ""eating/food stalls"" area of Markets....either way; look, buy to take home or back to your hotel or just sit down and have lunch! Try the Chive Korean Pancake! As we say in Hawaii...Sooo Ono!"
Food part of Gokje,This is basically the food part of gokje market. It's great for shopping for what you need for cooking or stopping for a bite. They sell lots of baking things as well and liquor.
