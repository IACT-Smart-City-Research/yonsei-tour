Nice place to visit☺,"It is one of the great spot that I discovered here in Jincheon and I've been in this place many times. I love to spend my summer here because, of it's clean environment and fresh air to breath☺ "
"Poor in content, but had good atmosphere and park","C1 ( 2015.03.13 ) This museum had some exhibits related Bell, but this subject was restrictive and incomprehensive, I think. So museum exhibits had the limits. The museum's inside was very clean and in perfect order. Around outside, there was good place to walk with good atmosphere like good park. There was need to improve contents, but had good atmosphere."
