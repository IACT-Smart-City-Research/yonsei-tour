The place to watch movies not available at CGVs,"CGV is Megabox, two giant movie theatre chains in Korea, have overtaken cinema industry in Korea. These multiplexes each have 10+ theatres in one location and yet, most of them are full of blockbusters. Many art movies or Oscar contending movies, are usually not available in those places. Cinecube is one of a few independent theatres in Seoul where they screen those good in-the-monority type of movies. There are only two screens here, and obviously seats numbers are very small and limited, but that only makes the whole experience much better. If you are getting sick of what the multiplexes are throwing at you, and you're wanting to see those real good movies, not only in english but also in french, spanish and whatnot, check out this place. One of the good thing about this place is you can almost always get a ticket on sight without making a reservation beforehand. Enjoy!"
