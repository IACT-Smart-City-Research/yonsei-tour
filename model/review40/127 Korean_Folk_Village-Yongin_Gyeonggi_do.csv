DO NOT GO IN OFF SEASON,"Went to the Folk Village today (November 2019) - the place itself is nice (the Joseon style houses were well kept and interesting) BUT off season meant that every single workshop was closed (I.e. any interactive element of the village), construction and maintenance meant many things were fenced off (including all of the food court seating!) and the “entertainment zone” rides were all at an extra cost despite paying 20k won entry per person. There was basically nothing to do and the entire place felt like a ghost town; we were done within an hour. Felt like a big waste of time. I’m sure it would be nice in peak season but they should either close the park in off season or offer a discount cost if they are going to remove most of the entertainment for remaining visitors. Very underwhelming."
Boring,"Amazed at the good reviews here. Maybe coz there was a slight drizzle alot of performances were off. Even the exhibits where we were supposed to see craftsmen at their work, only a few supposed craftsmen were there. Took a few photos n left. Not worth the long journey here from city. Why do people spend good money to come here. "
A must visit place for foreign grown ups,"If you're visiting Korea, a cultural tradition heritage stuff must be in your visit list if you're grown up adults or smart teenagers. No need to explain in details. Just take a time to visit to explore and leave cultural remark on your Korean tour."
Enjoyable Visit,Interesting place to visit... gives one an idea of the old way of life of the koreans. Great shows at certain times of the day which should'nt be missed. Even the school childrenwho were there having field trips enjoyed the shows. Well worth spending time to explore
Truely Amazing Attraction,"I enjoyed this attraction.This is a korean old ancient cuiture attraction showing how the things were in ancient korea.This attacted me much because ,we in India had same traditional culture and even today in remote villages.I took lot of photos.I WAS REALLY SATISFIED WITH THIS TOUR.A must see attraction"
An all day experience ,"Take the day and simply enjoy what the Folk Village has to offer. There’s tons of history and even though it’s crowded at times, it comes in spurts. So wait for the Korean crown to move on and take in the village at your own pace. Enjoy some scallion pancakes....Yum!"
Interesting Afternoon and a couple of suggestion,"Since I had a free afternoon on a business trip to Seoul I decided to visit the Korean Folk Village. It was an interesting afternoon as they have re-creations of a number of traditional houses, offices, and even a jail! Perhaps because I visited on a Sunday afternoon the place was quite crowded and there were many korean families and young people there. Particularly interesting was that a good number of the young people, mostly couples, we’re dressed in beautiful traditional Korean clothes. Now my suggestions. I came from Seoul to the Village by cab which was probably the quickest way but expensive. I decided to take public transportation back to Seoul since I had no idea where to get a cab back home. So far as I could tell, there were no instructions in the village on where to catch a cab or public transportation. There was a guide in English where this could have been explained. Even better would have been an information booth for English speakers. There was a free shuttle bus from the Village to a local station which I discovered on the internet but this ran irregularly. Second suggestion. Although there are a number of performances in the Village it is very hard to figure out the schedule for those performances. It would be easy for the Village operators to post those (in Korean and English) near the entrance. "
Great Experience ,"I am so glad that we decided to do this. There was so much to learn. It appeared that many families were spending the day there which was nice to see. We spent more time there than I thought we would have. Some activities for children, a few places to eat, and also reenactments take place. The grounds are larger than expected and there are plenty of photo ops. "
A nice place to visit to learn the culture,"You can learn and understand the ancient way of life in this folk village. From the manufacturing of olden day tools , By Straw , iron, wood and the ancient farmers houses, land owners house and old jail and daily they have folkloric dance performances. "
A truly precious Korean cultural place,A place to learn and understand the Korean culture. Include traditional costumes rental services. Learn about the old days Korea and various Korean traditional houses and way of living....Nice and valuable visit...
Not a bad idea to spent 1/2 day here.,"Came here by a day tour booked with Klook. Good to spend 3 hours here looking around this place and enjoy the performance. This place was pretty big but a pity that we are on a tour so we couldn't stay any longer. Will be nice to wear a hanbok to tour this place as though one live in the past.A glimpse of how the traditional houses/resting shelters look like. Traditional korean performances such as the dance and horse riding stunts which looks incredibly amazing! This place is wheelchair friendly, hence won't be an issue for those elderly with difficulty in walking."
Far from city of Seoul but a must see for Segok-drama lovers,"We took 2 buses from Myeongdong going here (about 1 1/2 hours). I have to stay on my toes as the local/provincial buses does not provide English translation on what station it is already. It was harder when we get back and luckily i found a Korean guy who helped us take Korail going back to Seoul. Anyway, Korean Folk Village is a great place to see and experience the Joseon Dynasty. It literally a village where you can learn Korea's history. We rented hanbok and the entrance is discounted when you are in hanbok. It's a good thing that the weather was perfect (not so hot and not so chilly). We went on a Monday so the line was not so long. We saw some areas where Segok drama was shot. There are also shows/performances you can watch & enjoy. Food, however, is limited. We ate at a food court but I expected more since it's a joseon dynasty era. The food were modern & not so great. But overall experience in this place was really great. But next time, i suggest to get a tour guide as not to be confused on how to go there."
A historic travel and good shows,I've nearly seen all shows there - they were all very entertaining. Place is well preserved (or made). It makes you feel old Korea from head to toe.
Great,"Great place to visit, but I wouldn’t recommend it for people who are only staying in Korea for a limited time, and only in Seoul, it isn’t worth the travelling.It is an amazing replication of a traditional Korean Hanok village. Wearing Hanbok here gives a discount, and is an amazing photo opportunity. "
"Korean version of Universal Studio on a much, much smaller scale","Enjoy walking in the recreated village where traditional Korean lifestyle is preserved and exhibited. In the Folk Village, various lifestyles prevalent during the Joseon Dynasty can be seen. You will enjoy traditional Korean performances (weather permitting). We saw a wedding, a horse show with male and female riders, a tightrope walker/dancer and a plate spinning/music group."
Bukchon Hanook Village,It is a must to village. A very clean and quiet place to live at. The buildings are very unique and historical. It's a must to pay a visit!
Good in cool weather,This outdoor village was good way to learn history of Korea and how the lifestyle has evolved. Great contrast to booming city Seoul is today. Nice when temperature was cool but can imagine it would not be comfortable in summer since entirely outdoors
"Must do, when visiting Seoul!","That was just like a jump back in time, completely surreal experience. I spent there 5 hours and would definitely spend a couple of hours more but it was a close time. Plan a full day for this visit. "
"Korean Folk Village, Yongin, S. Korea.","My review classifies the Korean Folk Village, located in Yongin, a major city of close to one million people and a part of the greater Seoul Metropolitan Area here in South Korea, as a very good attraction. Beauty is always in the eye of the beholder. The Korean Folk Village is absolutely enormous. When we arrived, the parking lot itself was enormous. I asked my friends IF we would even be able to get into the Folk Village with so many cars / visitors. They confidently told me that there would be absolutely no problem getting into the Village. They were absolutely correct. The lines to purchase tickets were relatively short and they moved very quickly. The instant we passed through the entryway I was amazed that there were only a moderate number of people visible. So much for there being a crowd. Do seniors get a discount? I am an 82-year old senior and my friends paid for my admission so I don't know.This size of the Village presents a problem IF you are a senior citizen with some walking restrictions. The good news is that there seemed to be ample places to sit and to rest. But it still requires a lot of walking IF you want to see say 50 to 75% of the Village. In my opinion it is far too large to see it all in one outing. Yes there also seemed to be toilets handy when I needed one.After awhile, a sort of 'sameness' set in. I found once I had viewed ten or fifteen Folk Homes they began to all look the same. I would not even remotely think of coming here on a rainy day. Bottom Line : You have to have a certain interest in how people lived centuries ago to really appreciate the Village. I found it to be an overwhelming experience and I am happy that I visited the Village."
Interesting and fun even in the middle of Winter,"The Folk Village is separated into sections. One of which is a small amusement park section. Even as adults it was fun, with the drop, dodgems, viking ship etc. I think the best part was the snow field. Two slopes just for sledding. One for the younger kids and one for older kids. Plenty of space to sled and heaps of fun. The other section was fascinating, a series of villages depicting different time periods and regions of Korea. It was a little interactive, it would be more so in the Summer months. There was also performances and plenty of eating venues. It was winter, so everything was frozen, dead and bare, but it was still beautiful. They also had a special deal where is you wore Hanbok, tradiltional clothing you got in for half price. So it was pretty cool to see people wandering around in traditional clothes. I really enjoyed it, I went with a couple of Korean lads, but would have been comfortable wandering around by myself. Highly recommended."
Nice historic place,I cam here with a local guy which was really helpful since you wont find English speaking people everywhere. However the place gives you a good idea about the daily life in ancient times. Also you most probably will see a lot of students wearing lovely historic dresses. Take your time and relax.
Korean Folk Village (winter),"They still follow schedule of performances even during winter. They have 40% discount during the Korean Grand Sale...entrance fee was only ₩13,000.Frozen lake and cool weather...try visiting not on a winter for more colorful nature. But if you want soul searching then walk along the trail, watch shows and try ice fishing. Restaurant food inside is good."
Must visit during good warm weather,"I think nice weather is essential for a great satisfaction here. It was cold weather and muggy ground when we visited after winter rain. And there's not enough work going on about it. So, visitors had some trouble with shoes.- For public transportation from Seoul, there's a free shuttle from Suwon(수원) Station Exit #4. During holiday season, having bus #37 or #54 at Sanggal(상갈) Station Exit #4 will be better. Nagok Maeul(나곡마을) is where to get off.- Comparing to other village parks in Korea, the admission charge is a lot. (20,000 won)- Good to spend 3~5 hours.- There aren't that many staffs wearing like village people.- The experience of a traditional floor heating was available in the afternoon.- Also had shops of 60's 70's to bring nostalgia. - There are 2~4 performances per certain time slot in the morning and they have them again in the afternoon. All good to watch.- There's an event for winter fish catching eating. But, it needs an additional money to join. Not much interested.- Entrance ticket can include the availability of the amusement park with an additional charge. It will be good for visitors with children.- The best part is the old time tavern. The most crowded place. Had a long queue for Gukbap(국밥) there which is the real old Korean food."
"Loved it! Korean Cutural Displays, House & Shows","We came to see & learn more about Korean traditional culture. Plan to spend at least 4 or more hours to visit most of the exhibits and multiple shows shown throughout the day. One of the highlights of this park was seeing Korean teen girls and couples waling around the park in tradition Korean dress-up costumes. It was delightful so see all the different colorful costumes, especially the couples outfits.BOTTOM LINE: Loved the Korean Folk Village! Learned a lot here. Went to the suspended light rope walking skills show, fold dance & music show, equestrian ride skills show and tradition Korean wedding marriage show. All were very great to see. The biggest complaint I had was what seemed like every school kid in Korea here visiting! Oh my gosh! There were upwards to 1,000 kids running around everywhere and quickly filled every venue for the shows; noisy and distracting. That was a tough pill to work thru. Love kids, but that allowed too many at one time. Over-all, setting aside fro the kid distraction, worthwhile seeing. MY RATING: 7/10NOTE MOBILITY: Most of the walkways and trails from venue to venue are uneven compact dirt unless, it rains. Pushing a wheel chain could be challenging. Multiple up and down elevation changes. This venue also has a modern theme park attached. We did not go there. Plan an extra half-day for that. Venue has a traditional Korean dress-up photo shop. Many restaurants and craft shops to visit."
Beautiful and lets one take a peek at what Joseon dynasty Korea looked like,"I have been to this attraction 3 times. The entrance fee of 18000 KRW is quite steep but we were able to get discounted tickets on Klook for only 546 PHP (11800 KRW).Located in Yongin, it's very accessible via public transportation. From the bus stop, you have to walk a bit (around 8 to 10 mins or less??) Once you get inside the village, you'll definitely be amazed. What did farmers' houses in the southern region or central region look like? What did the governor's office look like back in the Joseon dynasty? You'll only see it here!They have shows too. I was able to witness the equestrian show and the rope show.They also have a hanbok shop inside the village, and it's best to take photos wearing that for an authentic feel.If you get hungry, there is a Korean food court inside.A must-see!"
Great place to experience the Korean traditions,"Korean Folk Village is one of the main tourist attractions in South Korea, located in the the city of Yongin, relatively close to Seoul. Excellent traditional Korean village and museum, displaying elements of traditional Korean life and culture. We can see people dressed up in traditional Korean outfits. It was nice experience to watch the traditional crafts making. Overall a great place to experience the Korean traditions."
Expensive Place to Visit,"It cost 18000 won for an adult to enter the place. What we see isn't fantastic compared to what we saw in Jeju, which was free and the locals actually lived there. Not worth paying so much to get in, may be because we have seen several other folk villages in our earlier itinerary. "
See it all in one place ,"Located in Yongin, relatively close to Seoul and accesible by mass transit transportation, the Korean Folk Village is a most in your Seoul itinerary.What is it? Well, it’s a park consisting on relocated traditional and historic homes from all over South Korea and set into a wonderfully well kept natural environment which will delight everyone from adults to young children.You’ll be able to experience traditions, handicrafts, artistic performances and more in this place.If you are lucky enough to visit it during the month of October, be ready to delight yourself with the multicolored foliage which abounds in this place.There are several arts and crafts shops with food produced by local artisans as well as an ample selection of places to eat. In most cases, restrooms will be readily available and 80% of the place is wheelchair or stroller accesible.No less than a 3 hour long stay should be planned for this spot; even longer if you plan to eat and shop here.Don’t miss it! "
Great experience!,"So glad we came on the weekday! Even on the weekday, there were so many people there! Great day trip from Seoul to learn Korean culture & how they live. We purchased online tickets in advance to avoid the queue. We felt we didnt have enough time coz the place is huge!"
Best Folk Village Experience,"Best time to come is during the week on a Wednesday. Fridays, Korean Holidays, and weekends is a bit crowded. Recommend purchasing the ticket for the amusement park. It was worth the cost! Great place to sample traditional Korean food. Prices for food and souvenirs inside the village were reasonable. Lovely place to take pictures of the foliage!"
Fun,"This is a really great experience. A lot to see and do. Lots of school children and people dressed in local clothing. Old housing, palace and warlord buildings. Nice places to eat and try food and local snacks. Must see. Reasonable pricing and shows to see."
Good place to learn Korean cultures,"Good place for the children and foreigners to learn Korean cultures. If you stay IN Seoul, you can make it as a one day trip. You can spend a day over there. "
Interesting Place,Crowded but worth this visit . Take note if u taking bus 10-5 from Suwon Station it take about 1 hour and 15 mins to reach. Not sure about the free shuttle bus . Then I took cab from KFV back to Suwon Station around 5pm it take about 40 minutes and there is bit jam. Cost me around 15k won. I think KFV is better than Nami Island. 
A good representation for typical rural living,"The place is representing OF rural Village living. From The houses, manner OF living and folk dances. The Village gives a reasonable replica OF How people live. There are also performances for Tourist and students to appreciate. IT is a huge place and you Will spend at least 3 hours to see all the buildings, houses and performances. A must place to visit if you want to experience How The locals live in The rural areas."
Great place to learn about Korean traditions and cultures,This place is huge but well organised. Visiting it gives a great and informative overview for both locals and foreigners to learn about traditional Korean village and lifestyle. The exhibits and shows were so impressive and amazing. It’s definitely worth a visit!
Interesting place ,"It is an interesting place to visit. However, avoid visiting during any public holidays. This place can go crazy. "
Great Fun,"Its a great cultural experience. We loved our day there. We attended to a traditional wedding, we watched the horses show, there was even a movie being recorded in their facilities. It was a great time! The kids loved!"
Korean Folk Village,"It was amazing to see the culturalaspect of Korea. During our visit there were school children who were on their field trip. It was nice to see how the children with their teachers immerse themselves with their Folk Dances and acrobatic acts. Overall, a pleasant experience."
Consider the weather,"It was raining when we went, there's almost no shed available. So you should check the weather. Performances still pushed through but some were cancelled. Food is really nice though.This is quite far from the city. Around 2-2.5 hr drive. We went via EG bus."
Huge Park.,"We spent an entire day at the Village and still did not see everything. We saw the Equestrian show, the Farmers Music and Dance, Acrobatics on tight rope and the wedding ceremony. Got the least out of the wedding ceremony as it was all spoken in Korean. The other shows were enjoyable without any need to know what was being said. The grounds has active gardens, live animals and actors in traditional clothing. There is examples of building styles from the Joseon Dynasty, and shows how houses were built according to status of the owner and location of the home. We ate in the traditional Korean cafeteria. We also visited the Folk Museum located on the grounds. We were happy we took this tour through the Kooridor Tours office located near Camp Humphreys."
A lot of fun.,"A friend came from the States. Me and my friend took her to Korean Folk Village. I was there like a decade ago. Now, there are new buidlings, new charectors, new shows and etc. Actually, I had fun than I expected. I didn't have much expectation from previous visit, but now, I do recommend to visit there."
Must see in Kyunggido,Very old theme park but still quite good to visit for foreigners and locals too. My 11 year old boy always enjoys there so much. Inside there’s a market place and restaurant. They sell korean traditional dishes and the quality of food is very good . 
Excellent family fun,The park is very big and mainly all outdoors. There are actors as well as visitors walking around in traditional Korean clothing. Ask and they will take a picture w/you. There are shady areas to take a break and nap. Take plenty of water or stop by one of their restaurants and grab an icee or a full Meal. Both Korean and American meals reasonably priced. There is also a small theme park but didn't venture there. You can spend a whole day watching the outdoor show's and walking around. 
Great experience,"Went June 2018. Hot. Pack water. Huge place. Watched all the shows. Spent 3 hours and that didn't even cover the whole place. Could've spent more time but most of the houses look similar. Loved the shows. There's a horse acrobat, tightrope walking, traditional dance, traditional wedding (boring but the bride is cool to take a picture of), traditional games. Perfect for families. Lots of school kids. Food is average. At the entrance, they mapped all the filming locations of shows like My Love from the Star. Wish I had seen that. From Gangnam area, you catch a bus that looks like a tour bus. It was crowded on the return bus and we ended up standing all the way (not fun)."
Time Travel to the Joseon Era,"I've always heard so much about the Korean Folk Village, so I was very pleased to finally be able to visit for myself all there is to see and breathe of how the Joseon Era must have been like. Everything was so interesting!There is absolutely so much to see and do here. Everything from old homes (peasant life and aristocratic life), farm life (animals and plantations included), demonstrations of how the Koreans made straw shoes, rice cakes, silk, etc. Don't hesitate to really take your time in browsing each corner. And there's also performances that take place where you can watch old Korean entertainment such as tightrope walking, traditional music, and more!NOTE: This place is seasonal, so always check their calendars to see when they are open before you venture over. Enjoy!"
Interesting cultural experience ,We visited as part of our tour group. This was very interesting. You can see the old style houses. The way tools and shoes were made. The different levels of living standards based on a caste system.
You can dress up and pretend you are in the Joseon period,"Despite the rain, excellent fun. You can spend the day here, lots of coffee places and restaurants. Picked up some classic wind chimes, and they have shows for weddings, music, plays everything really. Get involved and dress up!"
Living museum of traditional life,"We visited the Korean Folk Village (KFV). It is a popular tourist destination for both Koreans and foreigners. The village is showcasing traditional Korean culture and lifestyle of the 19th-century. The village is 245-acre in size. It comprises tiled traditional houses and buildings from around Korea, these replicas of houses of the different social classes of peasants and landlords. You will encounter artisans wearing traditional clothing as you walk around. You will need 5 hours to complete the village. One of the houses was built with empty space underneath for ventilation, as it is considered a summerhouse. Anther method for cooling down during the summer is the Bamboo wife for restful sleep of husbands, where a man will cling tightly to a bamboo cylinder like sleeping aid, pretending tat it is his wife. More over, there are 3 live performances by artisans during the day. SEE photos."
Beautiful and educational,"We had fun wandering through the different kinds of homes in each dynasty. My chidlren especially enjoyed the equine show and the traditional wedding ceremony. Also wonderful these days to watch Korean dramas and recognize the location sets from the village. It was great watching the locals old and young alike actively visiting such sites and learning about their history. Would love to visit again, hopefully in cooler weather as it can get hot. We found a Baskin Robbins within the grounds though so all was good. (Yeah, it was pretty awesome seeing that familiar logo on a period hut ;) )"
Hanok village meant for locals,"According to my guide, this hanok village is seldom visited by tourists as it is built more for educating the younger korean generation about their history and culture in joesan dynasty. Majority of the visitors are locals, only a handful are tourists. Inside the hanok village, it showcases the different housing used by the different classes in joesan dynasty, the commoners vs the noblemen, vs magistrates. Also the jail and the means of torture they used in the past. If you have great interest in learning about korean culture and joesan dynasty, this place is a must visit. Otherwise you would feel it is touristy and a waste of your time. I had a wonderful guide explaining everything about joesan dynasty and had a wonderful time. Managed to catch all 4 shows on site. Be there before 10.30am for their first show. The tight rope walking and the martial arts performance are very entertaining! Make sure to have sunblock or wear a hat/cap if you visiting during this period of time. Place is pretty stroller friendly. Saw many locals gg with their kids in strollers. "
A peek into life during Joseon Dynasty,"This is another huge village complex consisting of a market, folk, and amusement village. We just went straight to a portion of the folk village where we saw acrobatics on a tightrope walking and equestrian performances due to our limited time. Maybe next time we could spend a little more tome here to enjoy the other villages."
The best korea village,It is so worth it. I had to say if i have a time i wish i could visit this place again. This is beautiful place that must visit
Touristy but fun,"This is worth a stop if you have time! There is lots to see; I especially enjoyed the quiet of the temple area while my young daughter enjoyed playing with the silks in the silk-making part of the village. You can do many hands-on experiences to learn about Korean folk culture, and it’s all in all very picturesque setting."
Excellent place to learn about Korean traditions and culture,"Walking around with a local, I learned so much about past Korean traditions and culture - like how to ""iron"" silk or how they created an artificial ""cave"" with a hay building and buried ceramic pots to preserve food. There were performances - a wedding or a country dance. It has good selection of food & drink which you order from multiple booths. We were there during the week in April so there were lots of children on field trips. The amusement park was not running. There were places to get snacks or get some tea. It was a lot of walking but absolutely worth the time. If you are from the USA, this is like Williamsburg."
excellent combination of traditional/nature/entertainment,great for all ages-if you have 1 day in korea. i would not hesitate to recommend. great for chidlren to senior citizens. Much better in spring and fall. allow 3- 6 hours here.live performance- horseriding show was impressive. can eat food inside- tasty korean food at reasonable price of $7~10.ample parking lot. If you have only 1 day - you can do folk village in the morn and everland-eve& nite(everland has afternnon ticket which is a bit cheaper than full day)다양할 볼거리 할거리 먹을거리가 있어서 다양한 연령층에 적당함. 외국인과 같이 갔는데 매우 만족해했음. 특히 자연경관이 예뻐서 봄이나 가을에 가장 아름다움.
This place is Folk-ing great!,"We spent the day at the Korean Folk Village and had a wonderful time. We had 3 generations of family at the village and there was something for everyone of all ages. The day we went it was cold and it was not peak season so some of the exhibits, shops and restaurants were closed, but we still had fun. There were shows to watch, exhibits to see, and swings and other thins for kids to play on and crawl over. The are also restaurants and souvenir shops, and small folk museum to wander through all accessible with the admission price. The restrooms are clean, and there was on-site parking. There was also a store near the park entrance were you could rent traditional Korean attire to wear in the park. Bring the family or bring your friends and enjoy."
Great cultural experience and amusement park,"I was here with two Korean friends on an afternoon during the week in the winter, when things were rather quiet. Very nice experience. The performances etc were all purely in Korean, but that only slightly lessened the experience. This attraction gives a great overview of a traditional Korean village, its buildings, and how it was organized and administered. There were also various performances including a tightrope walking and acrobatic horse show, which were very well done. The site also has many restaurants and tea shops, and various shops, plus an amusement park that is ideal for kids. This is a great place for both Koreans and foreigners alike, but I would particularly recommend it to foreign tourists who want to combine a glimpse on Korean culture with fun relaxing activities."
Place worth for a visit,"This is a place worth visiting, a lot to see especially for a person like me who is very fond of kdrama, I did watched a lot of historical drama, that's why I enjoyed every corner of this place, as a go along I can imagine the scenes which I watched in those drama. A very spacious area, recommend to have an all day event in order to see the whole area + the shows, wear walking shoes. Due to the area, maybe its not that suitable for old people whose not capable of walking BUT there are a lot of stop over places."
Trying a new place,"My family and I just finished egg hunting and I really didn’t feel like cooking so I wanted to try this new restaurant. Price was reasonable, the kids enjoyed learning how to use a chopsticks as well as increasing their palette. We asked for no msg, I had the japchae, kids had chicken teriyaki and hubby got seafood tofu soup. His dish was too spicy, I don’t mind since I like spicy food, kids ate all their food and they gave us free dessert which of course the kids enjoyed. I will be back again with my friends."
Enjoyable outing for the family ,"As a k-drama fan, it was really nice to see historical buildings just like in the dramas. Everything was well organised with good signage in key languages including English. I was even surprised to find a live cow in one of these buildings - talk about realism! The kids particularly enjoyed the Farmers music show as well as the equestrian show. Both were very engaging despite us not understanding a word of korean. Perhaps the MC could commentate in both English and Korean in future? Also I felt there could be a more efficient way of selling tickets such as a separate queue for group tickets or permitting online sales to allow folks to beat the queue. I wished we had more time though the 3h we spent there seemed to fly by. Highly recommended! "
Really great place to explore Korean culture,I was in the Folk Village in January 2018. Almost empty and really cold. The village is large with many traditional houses. It was a nice way to see how people lived in Korea a long time ago. We had a Korean guide who gave us the story behind all houses. She made everything come to life so if possible book a guide. There are also live performers in traditional clothes showing hunting traditions and rituals. You can easily spend a whole day in the village. 
Great place to explore!,"On my trip to South Korea this past summer, our group visited the Korean Folk Village. I was expecting a little village with maybe only a few buildings. I had no idea how big this place was. It felt like you were at an amusement park with how big and spread out it was. I loved being able to roam around and explore. It wasn't very busy when we visited so it made it feel as if we had the place all to ourselves to explore. My wife and I took many great photos here. They also have many live performances and interactive exhibits that teach you about the rich culture and history of Korea. You could spend all day here. Definitely a great place to visit. Just make sure to wear comfortable shoes!"
korean drama feels,Only few visitors and you can enjoy taking pictures. if you like korean drama and know which have shoot here then you will appreciate this attraction more. it's well maintained and has english translation on descriptions. it also offers korean sweets which are hand made and done on the spot.
A must visit,"We went as a group of 6 on a cold winter day. We deliberately chose a weekday so that we would be able to enjoy our visit. We managed to see all of the performances scheduled, enjoy a fairly good lunch (great variety & being able to eat ina heated room was a bonus) & participate in all of the paid activities as well.On the way out, we stopped by at the cafe to drink tea & eat the sweet red bean porridge. Ssanghwacha was really excellent. We were a bit skeptical at first but it turned out to be a great day."
Avoid on rainy days,"We took the 10.30am free shuttle at exit 4 of Suwon Station to KFV, and returned by the 4pm shuttle. 5 hours in the park!It was raining in the early morning. Although the rain had stopped, the lady at the ticket office spent some time explaining to us that some of the shows may be cancelled. Outdoor amusement park games may also not be available, so perhaps a free pass (compared to a general admission ticket) may not be worthwhile. We purchased the free pass anyway.On entry, we were told that the cancelled 11am Farmer’s Music and Dance has just commenced (11.30am) since the rain has stopped. As each performance only lasts 15-20min, we had to brisk walk (quite far when you are in a hurry) to the performance area. The muddy ground made movement difficult and our boots were quite a sight after the walk. Alas, there was no dance. Only music on a stage (because the performance ground was just as muddy).Due to the late commencement of the first show, all the 3 performances were back to back. The Tightrope Walking is a must-see. We enjoyed the joyful atmosphere (cheers and sing-alongs) the performer created, although we could not understand the language. The Equestrain performance was good too!As we explored the village, we found some staff who were really hospitable and offered to let our children try carrying the baskets and eating the sweet potatoes cooked in the village furnace. The uncle at the Jeju area was especially nice! But sad to say, some staff were sullen and did not return our smiles or answer our questions. Language barriers perhaps?By 2-3pm, all the rides in the amusement center were open. Great place for kiddy rides.In summary, an enjoyable day but next time, I would try to visit when it has not been raining."
One of the best places to visit,We loved it. Very nice and extremely nicely done. We have watch all the shows and visited almost all the buildings. Highly recommend.
"perfect blend of nature, culture and entertainment!!! Daebak!!","this is a must-visit place when in Korea...amazing mix of nature( the autumn foliage was spectacular), culture (from the authentic structures to the live cultural workshops) and entertainment (performances and ""villagers"" and even visitors are in traditional Korean garb)...not as crowded as Nami because KFV is huge! there's even a theme park for kids.. i regret that we did not fully tour the place since we got sidetracked in gangnam and arrived late in the afternoon, but what we saw was really awesome. a lot of kdrama shows and movies were shot here. but even if one is not a Kdrama fan, KFV will surely impress"
Historical Journey & Serenity ,"U will hv a chance to experience a true Korean lifestyle back in the Dynasty age. Every details were very exquisite. This is a Village replicating the original korean life, their houses, market, culture and activities. Spent at least 2 hrs to experience a truly life time experience.For smoker, no worries, they hv a smoking box for u guys."
Learn Korean Culture from the Folk Village,"It's my favorite place in Korea. Korean Folk Village is located not too far from Suwon. You can take free shuttle bus of KFV from Suwon Station. Here, you can learn Korean culture, eg. houses of people in the old era (villagers, farmer, noble), school, government offices, etc. You can taste many delicious Korean food and also try to make your own Korean stuffs from many workshops too. There are some traditional performances everyday."
Korean Historic Tour,We took a guided tour to Korean Folk Village and it was a great experience to see the Korean history. We loved the way the history has been preserved and showed. Loved to see the old tools and techniques used to earn living in the past. Watched a musical performance and bought many souvenirs.
A quick tour through Korea's past,"Lovely autumn weather for a visit. Although we visited on a Sunday, it was not that crowded. Enjoyed the shows and especially the real traditional wedding. Getting food at lunchtime can be a challenge. Especially at Market Village with one electronic ordering machine - better be sure what you want beforehand. Went to restaurants near entrance and easier to get food. Did enjoy the glutenous rice wine and Korean dishes."
nice,"Two hours away from Seoul city centre and it's worth it. The ticket costs 18,000 won for admission and 27,000 won for free pass which includes all amusement rides. The rides are mostly for children. For adults, a 18,000 won ticket is enough for exploring the village. After buying a ticket, don't forget to ask for a leaflet. They have an English version one. The leaflet gives enough information to enjoy the village including the show times. They have 4 shows like a wedding ceremony and acrobatics on a rope. Each show lasts about half an hour and each show performs twice a day. This place is a quick way to take a glimpse of Korean culture in the past. Exploring their traditional houses and household items that you can't find nowadays. There are many good photo spots, I enjoyed walking around taking photos for hours. Many tourists dress in traditional clothes, and they look great for the surroundings. If you come here at the right seasons, you may expect to see cherry blossoms and autumn foliage. There is a food park in the back of the village, there are about 20 food vendors selling Korean food. You should walk around to choose what you'd like or choose from the large menu board first. Then go to the ticket windows, order and pay here. You will get your tickets and give them to your vendors. I tried blood sausages and porridge, they were bloody awful :( I couldn't finish them."
Upgrades and refits,"Last time I went here, I complained about the lack of information about shows in other languages - that has been seen to! There are now maps and information pamphlets available in about six languages. This was great, as we could catch the farmer's music show, and my son's girlfriend got some great pictures.The actual houses and buildings have been kept in good repair, and I was pleased to see that the one big house had been put to use as craft teaching center. This is very useful, and a nice change.The souvenir shop's prices were quite reasonable, and my visitors got a lot of stuff to take back home.The only gripe is that the shuttle service from Suwon to the village is very infrequent, and there is only one local bus that heads that way. This meant that if you miss the shuttle, you are on an overcrowded bus, and tempers tend to flare up, leading to the kind of verbal brawl we all listened to on the way back. With many shuttles running from Seoul, surely a few more and bit later could be arranged from Suwon? It is certainly needed, judging by the number of locals who made use of the local bus service."
A unique day's adventure in Yongin,"I'm a little biased, because I lived within five minutes of this place for many years, but I made a point of visiting it at least once a year. They have fresh dongdongju, a traditional rice wine/liquor."
Interesting place ,"Visited the Korean Folk Village on Chuseok and it was packed with locals. Nonetheless we managed to enter quickly. It’s such an interesting place to be in. To be able to immerse yourself in the old era and also if you are a Korean drama fan, you would be able to understand and appreciate the locations even more. They do put up signage to tell you for which particular scene in the drama, this set was used for. Overall great experience but it would be nice if there’s explanation for the performances in English as we do not understand Korean. "
Beautiful Village ♡♡♡,The place is huge. You'd see different kinds of traditional Korean buildings. My favorite was the punishment grounds and the prison. There was a staged traditional wedding that afternoon which I thought was pretty cute. It was nice walking around. It made me feel like the time moved backwards to the old Korea. If you are into Korean TV shows or dramas. You might recognize some part/s of the village were sets of those shows. 
Fantastic day out,"What a great place to spend the entire day. We arrived a bit late and hence missed all the morning performances, but stayed back for the afternoon shows. The entire village looks and feels authentic and nothing feels out of place. Although I did find two negatives about this place. The first was there are two kennel where 2 dogs are kept. The kennels are quite small for the size of the dog. Irrespective, the dogs did looks extremely unhappy being there. I'm not sure what that's all about. Secondly the food offering is quite poor for the price paid. Apart from these it's a very good attraction to visit. It takes about an hour's drive from Seoul including traffic getting our if Seoul. We had a very good experience and can recommend this attraction."
What a wonderful place ,Artificial village to assemble the traditional korean village. It also contain restaurants and cafes. With a wonderful river view and waterfalls.
Must See ,"My new friends were correct! Yes, i very much enjoyed the tour through Korean history. This was their first time at age 22/20 yrs old. The views and performers were a grand sight to see.I would love to bring my family."
Great way to spend half a day,"My wife is Korean, so I loved learning more about the rich history & culture of Korea. The displays, houses & buildings are all very authentic. There are a great selection of restaurants & gift shops, and there is even an amusement park for the kids. For the price, this is an amazing bargain!"
Enjoyed thoroughly ,"This is a cross between theme park and museums. It's truly a unique experience. If you want to experience Korean traditional culture, and perhaps have some park rides, this is a place to be at. You can rent hanbok and explore the park in them. It has culture, fun park rides, history, animal viewing, and nature all balled up into one place. It's fun, and historical and entertaining, out of all the places I've been in to Korea(aside from jeju) this is one of the most memorable because it checks out many boxes. "
Yongin folk village,"A best place to explore old Korean traditions, arts and crafts and various traditional occupations. Small amusement park is also here where you can enjoy various rides. Best to visit in fall."
Cool History,"While visiting the Korean Folk Village we watched a tight rope performance, a horse show, and a marriage ceremony. We walked through lots of areas with different types of buildings and displays of historical artifacts!"
Fun and unique experience!,"Really.worth the 18,000krw ticket. Got to see 4 showcases depicting their tradition, their traditional.dance, tightrope, traditional wedding and horse riding performance. Please get the brochure, to get the timings of the.Performances! In the morning and the other in the afternoonPlease.Don't.visit here when it's raining as the performances will be cancelled. Such a waste!It's a very big place, we reached there at about 10.30am and left the area at 3pm. There's actually much more to.explore really. There's even pottery making!!! 7,000krw . You can keep it if you're staying in Korea for at least 20 days as they need time to burn and mail to you. Pay extra though. Theres a shuttle bus, but the timing I.saw online was different from what the counter told me so please check with them. Otherwise there's this public bus that can take you to the nearest subway station.The bus station is right outside the 7-eleven store.10/10 recommended"
First Impression,"Since it's my first time to Korea, I find it interesting and meaningful to immerse yourself in Korean culture. However if you are travelling individually it might not be worth it because you might not know much. Thus i recommend you to come here with someone who knows about the tradition and history so you can understand better. I have to inform you that this is just a historical area and not some sort of fun attraction. Do not expect much. It is only a place if you really want to understand Korean culture. There are only staffs to maintain the area and to perform Korean folklore. The place is all free roam.Environment: I went here during March so it's winter to spring. The trees there are dead but they do hang beautiful origami or transparent fabric to make it look magical yet sacred. I heard from my tour guide that if you come here during spring it will be more beautiful because of the magnolias and cherry blossom. If you are a photographer you might want to spend some time here. The gift shops are quiet costly but it is understandable because it's an elderly running the shop and it's carved or hand made by them.Overall: I don't think children will enjoy this because of their short attention span. This place will be perfect for those who love history, doing photography and seniors."
Experience Korea historical,"Visit here if you have free day out from Seoul!. The transportation is very easy we just take express bus right from Gangnam. Nice ride and comfy. The park is huge, make sure you take map and see the timetable about all the show! Recommending all the show!!! Lots of museum inside to read and learn about Korea historical. "
Great Location - Empty and No Staff to Man Great Historical Attractions,"This is a beautiful and well created folk village. Many sitcoms and movies popular in Korea was filmed here. They have a mini amusement park, restaurants, and zomes dedicated to the local historical homes, lifestyles of people long ago. The main problem is that noone was around to act out the scenes or demonstrate. The whole place looked dead and empty. For example the brass and woodwork factories where there was supposed to be people on standby was abandoned. The shows was very interesting hoever maybe we went on a bad they they kept messing up - Falling off horses and getting hurt. Quite frightening. Restaurant pricing was ok it wasn't overly expensive - Traditional Korean Food - Hotdogs and snacks are available. Ice cream drinks and convenience store. Restrooms are very clean and smokers need to smoke in designated areas. There's even a locker to stow animals! Prices for kids - teens - adults - 13,000, 15,000, 18,000 won - If you want the amusement park - 20,000, 22,000, 27,000 won. There's pricing for group tickets about 2000 won cheaper for groups of 20 above. Audio guides are 2000 won and available in 5 languages."
Korean Historial Drama fandom satisfied,"Ft. Black skinned pork on Jeju Island. Korean Folk Village is a wide establishment on Jeju Island that is a reconstruction of various dwellings used in a popular Korean medicinal-historical drama. What you will find there are different variations of low-roofed clay-wooden homes with straw roofing, ft some wealthier homes that have designated areas to breed the famous, cute and stinky Jeju black pig; fishing village replicas; traditional tool showrooms; geological rock showrooms (cause who isn't interested in stones and rocks, right?) Etc.If you enjoy a somewhat mindless stroll around one-storey low-thatched homes that all end up looking identical after the first 3 numbered areas on the map, this is the place for you. On another note, this village is suitable for photoshoots. There were many areas I felt were perfect spots for traditional themed photographs. Unfortunately, as I visited as part of a tour, my visit felt more of a rush through.There is even an area in the latter part of the village (before you pass a small town area with ACTUAL desperate salespeople trying to sell food to you) where you can try to play childhood Korean games. Eg. Walking on wooden stilts, throwing sticks into canisters, something like 'gasing'/spinning tops etc.What was unusual though was that the bins were ceramic pots along the paths. I made effective use of it since my nose bled profusely thanks to the Summer heat."
Really enjoy roaming around the Village,"If your a fan of Korean history drama then this place is a must for you to visit. I really enjoy watching some, drama scene that i couldn't forgot and many activity inside the village feels like I'm in the drama too lol....I didn't having a hard time going their though i just ride subway and stop at Yangjae station walk few steps then you can see the bus station you must ride bus number 5001-1 and just tell the driver to drop you at the Korean folk Village maybe from Seoul more or less 2 hours travel Then i go back to Seoul around 4pm I'm afraid bus going to the City is not always available hehehe.... "
Very Interesting Place to spend a half-day,"I took The Daily City Tour here. It's around 90 minutes from downtown Seoul. There wasn't nearly enough time to see everything while we were there. There are several different performances, houses from different sections of Korea, and some shops, restaurants. I wish I had more time to see all the performances and wander through the different buildings"
 Historical village,"I only went to one side of the attraction where there was a historical village with no reenactments. It says in the brochure that there are various crafts to learn, but none were available when I went. It's an interesting place for history buffs, but probably boring for all others. It becomes repetitive over time. This is a good place to take pictures dressed in a hanbok. I spent about three hours here going in and out of buildings in an efficient manner. However, it's easy to spend the whole day relaxing here."
Traditional Korean village for Korean Sageuk drama lovers,"This is not an old village from olden times but one built in traditional style and laid out in traditional style. It looks and feels like a Joseon era type village. i certainly recommend seeing it. if you love korean drama about the Joseon or Goryeo periods then this place is a must visit place. it gives you a sense of how people lived and what their houses looked like in days gone by. there are organised daily tours starting from Seoul where the tour bus comes to pick u up from the hotel . but we found them to be expensive and didnt save us on time as the tour buses had to travel the same route as our municipal buses. ours took longer as it made a few stops. we went there by bus, about an hour, 5001-1 from Gangnam station. Check to see you are on the right side of the road. as per previous posts, stay alert and look at the LED display . there are no other announcements in English as you get near the destination. we showed the bus driver our destination in Korean, and he told us to get off at the right stop. Its really cheap by bus , i think it costs us KRW 1400 each way. This site is used a fair number of times for the shooting of Korean Drama which relates to the Joseon era. The thatched houses range from peasants to farmers, to rich farmers and then to merchants and officials. There is some sort of food court on site which provides an average meal. it is only marginally more expensive than on the outside. The quality is also a bit on the 'lower ' side but it saves you having to bring or carry your lunch with you. when its hot in summer , do use the 'covered seating area ' next to the food court. Shows are put on like traditional music and dances, horse riding skills, a typical Joseon period entertainment like tight rope walking. and then finally a 'slimmed down' Joseon period wedding . all in all we enjoyed our day at Yongin folk village. at least this Hanok village was nearly quite authentic. the one in Seoul called Bukchon Hanok village feels a little modernised urban consisting of newly built Hanok homes."
Good place to appreciate Korean traditional life and culture ; tips on how to get there and go back,"I went here a week ago and I must say this place will take you back to the Joseon Era,Whether you are a Korean drama viewer or just tourist curious of their tradition this is the best representation of their culture. I am amazed how the place really looks like the old times. The village was also the filming sites for some Korean dramas.It will probably take you an hour to roam around the village. There's a traditional restaurant near the entrance. if you want to eat there and try traditional food, go there early, it's filled up during lunch time. Make sure not to miss watching the performances too. The horseback was amazing! There are also people in costume roaming around. The fastest and convenient way to go there is to take the Express Bus (Red) from Gangnam Station (Seoul Subway Line 2), Exit 10 Bus No. 5001-1. Make sure you fall in line with the correct bus no. I almost made a mistake because the bus going to Everland is also on the same stop, LOL It's 5-10 mins walking from Korean Folk Village Bus stop,I had a hard time going back to Seoul because I didn't go back to where I got off. I thought it was too far so I followed the way out sign when I exit the village. I found a bus stop and took Bus 37 (Green). This would take you to Sanggal and Suwon Station. Get off at Sanggal Station. It's only few stops away from KFV. unlike Suwon Station which is like 25-30 stops away! There's no English in the bus route map and the GPS so you really have to be attentive.Enjoy the place. It's quite an experience! and you will appreciate Korean culture."
Touristy and waste of time,"Well, it was okay but for me, transportation took a long time and I expected something more. First of all, our school bus took us there so I don't know how to go but it took a while to go even without the traffic jam. Secondly, you can see historical Korean building structures and their housing but it is made for tourist in 1974. I love natural and REAL historical places more than fake ones, I guess. Thirdly, performances there was fine but I have seen better ones. It wasn't a ""wow moment"" for me. Lastly, because it is in the remote area, the food there is expensive and I was not willing to pay that much. Thankfully, I brought my own gimbab!"
"a lot of wandering...and looking (a ""bit"" like a Renn Faire)","I am glad we went to this - but it was a lot of time to get to it and to get away. The trick performers on horseback were amazing. I wished more people were walking around in native costume.The day was slow and lazy - but crowded.If you have smaller children, it seems there are rides on one area...the lines were really long. Not sure how ADD kids would take to this strolling kind of atmosphere. I wish we would have planned to take in more ""shows.""NOTE: The free shuttle from the subway fills up fast. It is NOT a 20 min ride as they promote but more like 45 mins (traffic)."
An expirience,An expirience walking in a farmers village letting us understand the korean living of farmers. The artistic performance is very good. A must
History served easy,"A theme park, exhibits and a few live animals showing old Joseon era thatched hut living quarters, for various levels of castes. Interesting details. Also has entertaining live shows, the spinning ribbon guys are neat and the tightrope guy is a showman. Horse riding exhibition a little constrained, some similar stunts to western North America rodeos. Food court has fine selection of grilled foods and of course makejoli. A liver performance theatre in Korean seemed to have laughs for the audience, something about the local politician and gisaeng girls."
If you only have time to go to one place in Korea... this is it,"It's an ALL day thing, and perfectly priced for as big as it is, with as much to do as it offers.... it offers an amusement park for an increased price from 18K won to 36K won, which is perfect for the kids, cuz it's its on little area to the right after u walk in, freeing up the adults to walk around and soak it all in. 4K won will let u walk around with the costumes on to take pics in Very funGreat for learning about the ancient traditional Korean culture "
Great time. Don't miss on a trip to Seoul,"At first I thought this would be a little too Disney-ish, but it turned out to be a great day. The food was awesome, the traditional shows were very impressive and the ancient village replica was quite good. I highly recommend this, especially if you have children."
Home of Koreanovelas,As soon as we step in here i can't help recall the koreanovelas my daughter is fond of. The place is clean and relaxing to stroll at.
Enjoyed the performances here,"My first solo trip there. Please take a KTX train from Seoul Station to Suwon and catch the free shuttle bus provided by KFV (Korean Folk Village). Its only KRW 2,700 and saves you alot of time. I wasn't aware of this and took the subway and had to change a few times before arriving at the station and only to miss the shuttle bus. Beside this, the one minus point is the performance has no english narration (unlike the ones at Gyeongbokgung Palace). And the staff can't speak English too (I tried asking them if the 17:30pm shuttle to Sanggal station is in operation, they could not answer too). "
A place for family and culture!,"Our family enjoyed every moment we had at the village: the performances, the setting, the activities, the scenes, the plays, the games... All brought us back to a historical village of Korea, helped us discovering the culture and history, and understanding more about the country we were visiting. So enjoyable!"
The Unforgettable Journey,"I can't say much but this is an amzing place that worth a visit. It showed me so many things about the authentic culture of Korea and the marvelous landscape around. Too many things to see, so little time we had. But I won't miss a chance to visit this place once again in my next trip to South Korea. "
Nice place to spend a day and relax. Out of the busy Seoul,"Love this place. Will come back again to have the traditional tea and seat by the river. It was raining when we went. All outdoor performance are cancelled. We went on our own by public transport. We took the metro to avoid the rain and we find it is easier for us even need to change two times. Nearest station to this folk village is Sanggal station. Exit 2 to a bus stop. See the picture attached on the schedule between Sanggal station and Korean Folk Village. Ticket can be purchased on the spot at the door. But we bought ours on Internet by our Korean friend which is cheaper, 30,000won for two. "
A bit of Korean History ,"Good place to visit to learn more about the history and culture of the Korean people. Very informative, the museum was included in the admission. Enjoyed learning about their stages of life, how they celebrate the different holidays, and their food that is offered during these particular times. "
Great history tour of old Korea,First tour of Korea and my friends brought me here for a tour of the old traditional customs of South Korea. This was a great day and great place to bring children to watch the shows and tour the buildings. 
great placeto study traditional of korea,This place was so suitable for everyone who need to see old culture of korea. I love the photograph taken here so much. they are full of memories and hapiness.
Best way to get a glimpse and take photos of old Korea in one easy visit,"3 TIPS TO ENJOY THE KOREAN FOLK VILLAGEEvery area of the village provides a splendid display of heritage and history. You can’t stop taking pictures!1. Stay for a day and come fully charged.With so many things to see and do, you can spend one whole day here. Make sure you and your camera are fully charged. Bring back-up batteries as well.2. Don’t miss the performances.The location and schedule of events are listed on the maps and fliers at the entrance. Make sure you’re near the venues before the shows start.3. Watch out for the Joseon people walking around.They are staff members in character and in full traditional costume. Take photos with them, they’re really friendly This cultural park was one of my favorite tours in Seoul. Walking through the village was the best way to get a glimpse of old Korea in one easy visit."
Great Escape to Korea Past,This is a wonderful location to experience Korean culture. The houses and exhibits are wonderfully authentic. There is an opportunity to try on traditional Korean clothing and many options for food. Most things are reasonably priced and there are many restrooms. The shows are fun and the exhibits well put together. It's a lovely place to visit for all ages! It is worth noting the village represents how many places in Korea looked just fifty years ago. There are hilly areas and a lot of walking but it is a must see!
Nice afternoon Cultural Tour,We visited this tourist version of an authentic Korean village on a day when school kids were there learning about their past cultural history. We informative when compared to the high rise metro city of Seoul right next door.
Great place to learn about Korean culture,"Take a walk through the Korea of the past. You can see exhibits of Korean homes of different ranking from farming homes to the palace. They film the Korean dramas here, so if you get lucky you may even see the stars in action. "
Authentic folk experience,"The houses in this tourist destination are original buildings which were relocated from the city. You can imagine the lives of its former dwellers when you look at the beaten-down (but still standing strong) wooden pillars. Each section or house has its own theme, for example one house may belong to a farmer and displays old-timey Korean farming tools, another to a humble straw shoemaker, and even there's a pavillion and a pond that was used by the noblemen of the village.This feels like an immersive museum experience and because we went on a Monday there was very few people. The only bummer was in the winter, the streets get really muddy. I guess that's authentic to the Korean villages too!"
Very informative with nice shows,This is very informative on how many different people lived according to where they fit on social ladder. Fairly large lots of walking. Several good displays of dancing tight rope walking and horse back riding show. Many things to see and do. 
A lot of walking,This is a great place to take the family or for a couple to spend the day walking about. I loved the history and the stories and the wedding re-enactments. Would highly recommend this place to anyone visiting Korea
A must see for K-Drama fans.,"This review is specifically for someone like me who have known more about South Korea via K-drama, you would appreciate Korean Folk Village. It is so much fun seeing the thatched houses and the unpaved roads that were used in films. (same feeling going to Warner Brother's in London if you are a Harry Potter fan)."
Must see,"Great ""quick"" Korean History lesson - fun food, great displays, givens a real feel how Koreans lived. Great for the kids too!"
A little overpriced for what it is.,"It cost about 21,000￦ for entry. Inside there were a number of thatched buildings which were set up to reflect the life of a typical Joseon village. There were some live shows which were very exciting, especially the trick horse riding. However the village is not especially big, and even accounting for the shows, it only takes about 2 hours to fully explore it. If you are in the area it is a good visit, but I wouldn't go far out of your way for it."
Overpriced ,Nice enough but way too expensive and we used the Korean Grand Sale coupon. 3 hours here us plenty. The performances were pretty good. 
Nice place to visit with family to feel the traditional village in the middle of modern city.,Hang out with friends and family Small sized amusement park for kids and traditional food and alcohol for family dinner.Must go.
See old Korean Architecture,Great place to see old Korean Architecture. Different houses are on display which were owned by real people and have been brought here. The English texts and explanations could have been a bit longer.
Very interesting and good shows,We went there on a cold day but we dressed warm and made the best of it. The rope walking show was pretty cool. Horse riding show was good too. They have a kids play area as well but it was a bit cold for my daughter to enjoy it.We visited one in Incheon a few years ago but this one is bigger and better I think. Fun place for adults and children.
Interesting place,"Very interesting look into the past of this country. The exhibits and mock ups are well done, but after seeing the first 3 or 4 places, I started thinking to myself, time to leave, seen it all. On a positive note, the vendors were not pushy or rude to the guest like in some attractions. The food ""court"" was a bit confusing at first, I stood in line to order at one of the food windows only to find out I was in the wrong place. "
An eye opening to see all traditional houses!,"Again, with my mom. The selection could not be better? Well, we hired a private tour guide that had suggested to bring us there. This is from This is Korea private tour. So-called private tour. He came to our hotel and we walked towards his car and started our journey there. When we arrived, we paid our entrance fees and went into this Korean Village. On the other side of the bridge, it was a surprise to see children's play park, folk museum and stores (some closed during winter).We then walked to the Korean village. Really fascinating and we were lucky to see them shooting and filming at this place. You then can see traces of some K-Drama that had taken place for their truly historical built up. On the other side, we were on time and went for the shows~Korean traditional folk performance called Farmer's Music and Dance with drums and horse ridings show callef Equestrian Feats. This is an open-air performance! The equestrian art employs horse-riding techniques, incorporates the comtemporary dynamic technique in horseback tunbling, standing, backward riding, sideways riding, bow shooting and etc. Do go there earlier. 1st show usually in the morning. Our tour guide did not explain but just brought us there to watch performances.Try the street food as we were asked to go inside of the warm food court to get our meals. Normal. You also can get some souvenirs and the local snacks with different taste elsewhere.You can enjoy the view and some K-Drama points and our tour guide do make some jokes though. Get your wishes tight up the tree and a little token of donation will be nice for this old historical village.Enjoy and have fun!"
Worth It!,"TRANSPORTATION: While the place is a little difficult to reach by public transportation, we were lucky enough that the 5500-1 bus driver told us a faster route to get to the village. We were originally going to take the 5500-1 bus from Jonggak station to the village, but apparently that takes 2 hours, so instead we took the 5000 bus (stops in Myungdong) and transferred to the 37 bus at Sangmimaeul (one stop from the village), which only took 30mins-1hr.FOOD: The food was pretty good here and decently priced (we had the rice cake, beef soup with rice, rice cake soup and kimchi pancake), but the street food (odeng, etc) seemed a little overpriced (1,500W). Since we were looking for more cheap, traditional foods, this was a bit of a let down.ENTERTAINMENT: There are various shows (equestrian, folk villagers, traditional marriage) that are all free once you enter the village. While we could not experience the traditional marriage b/c it doesn't open until February, the other shows that we watched were amazing (pics attached)!! I personally found this park a lot nicer and traditional than the Namsan Hanok Village, plus it was less crowded, allowing for nicer pictures and a more relaxing experience."
Not a must see.,"A leisurely way to spend your day if you have spare time on your hands, but not a must-see. It takes about 2 hours to reach the place, from Central Seoul, if one takes public transport."
Lunch and Korean Folk Show,"Nice place that showcases the korean farm houses and the means they build them. The park is spacious so you won't feel congested even when there are many people in the park. They also have an eating area where we had our lunch, after which we went to watch the Korean cultural shows. "
A chance to experience Korean folk traditions in one place,The Korean Folk Village is a nice opportunity to see and experience many Korean folk culture and traditions in one place. It also has a mini amusement park for the families with younger children to have a great time. The place is visited by a lot of locals and many of them loved to help us experience their culture when we took part in activities.
Blast from the Past,Very interesting to see how the Korean's live in the olden times! The Houses they live in ..their kitchen..their cookware...their bedroom...they have live shows ... weddings etc. But if you chanced upon a rainy day ..it would be very muddy but in summer time its dusty! 
A must go area for tourists ,"I, like many Koreans, visit this place with kids and it always brings a smile to the little ones.There are some that talk about the historical accuracy and whatnot, but to me, it's all good and I visit perhpas once or twice a year.Place has traditional performances at different invertals so time your visit properly to see all the shows in one go."
Korean Culture & Traditions To Witness and Experience,"About:Korean traditional culture from the late Joseon period is at display here.Great place to visit and good outdoor activity for children of all ages.You can immerse yourself in cultural class experiences and other seasonal customs.Check the schedule before you visit.You can also see various places with unique features such as a farming village, private houses, official districts and a village street in realistic descriptions. There is nobleman’s house and traditional workshops too.There are many cafes and restaurants to eat from.Tips:Plan you day well and try to go in the morning as you can spend enough time to see all the things.Wear comfortable shoes as you have to do lot of walking.Can go on a rainy day too but better not as you can enjoy more better.The rides in theme park costs extra but worth it and especially fun for children."
Great culture and activities,"Pretty far out of central Seoul, lucky we got a lift with local friends. Great place and atmosphere, entertaining performances and fun things to do. Highlights for me were playing on the swing, grilling sweets on the fire, and the silk spinning demonstration. Lots of fun and inexpensive"
A Step Back in Time,"This is a ""must visit"" if you have the time while visiting Seoul.Like Williamsburg in Virginia, the staff are in traditional dress appropriate to the time, and include craftsmen (and women) pursuing old crafts. The staff and presentations are interactive; you can throw a pot on a traditional Korean potters' wheel (assisted by a potter) and even arrange for the pot to be sent to you after it has been fired. Similarly, you can participate in other demonstrations, and even have your fortune told by a traditional fortuneteller. The staff demonstrates activities traditional to the season, including boiling silkworm cocoons to capture the silk (and children wait to eat the silkworm larvae from inside the cocoons as the silk unravels).  The architecture includes examples from throughout Korea, ranging from peasants' houses to a Governor's mansion. As noted by other reviewers, the Folk Village is also used as sets for Korean movies and television shows. The Village has a number of ""shows"" of its own, including a traditional Korean wedding and horseback acrobatics. Toward the end of the Village is a marketplace, where handcrafts can be purchased, as well as traditional food. Don't pass up the opportunity to try the Dong Dong Ju, a sweet rice wine, very refreshing, and BinDaeDok, a green bean flour pancake.Near the entrance is a childrens area that includes an elevated train and numerous shopping opportunities.Wear comfortable walking shoes, and don't forget your camera. The Hanbok (tradtional dress) of the young ladies is beautiful, and the horsehair hats of the men are striking."
Must Visit Place,This is a must visit place which transport you back to the past village lives of Koreans. It is used mostly as film sets for many of the Korean TV dramas and films. So lovers of such drama shows will find this place especially more attractive.
The Untouch Side of Korean History,"Your stamina needs to be healthy, and your legs need to be strong since you have to endure long walks on this one. Here, you can "
You can see a part of Korea Culture,"You can see a part of Korea Culture at this place, old house and palace, life... when you see this place, you can know more Korea culture."
A must to visit,"I visited the Korean Folk Village and it was very good. It has food, and shows. It is a wonderful snap shot of Korean culture and I felt like I went back in time to a wonderful place.There were bus loads of small kids everywhere. I highly suggest that you go here and have a nice day of it! Don't rush through the place. If you can, dress up."
Experience Traditional Korea and have a fun day trip from Seoul,"Perfect location for a day trip from Seoul. It's only around 30 mins on the train and from there you can take the free bus or a taxi. This place is really good to learn about the different types of Korean houses from each of the different regions and to also see the difference in materials used and grandeur of the houses with increased wealth and stature. There are also many performances, activities and events lined up each day. We got to witness the archery event and also the Korean traditional wedding which was interesting. The place is massive with many places to visit and the abundant trees and greenery made it a nice day outThere is also a huge area where you can order Korean food. The soups and pancakes sold there were delicious. If you're looking for something different outside of Seoul, this is the place to be!"
Place to learn about Traditional Korea,"This is the best place to learn about Korea in old days.Korean Folk Village an open museum, so we can feel more realistic about their lives back then.We can see their homes, government office, nobleman mansion, etc. The highlight of this attraction is their performance : farmer dance, equestrian, wedding ceremony, so take a look at their timeline and arrange your visit.And don't forget to visit government office, you can see the torture tool and their dungeon. You can even see an actor who play a role a government officer, and take photo with him :D.The downside of this open museum is that all building and equipment is man made. Nothing is original from the old year. And they try to put a modern amusement ride inside the park, which I think the move is very very wrong.Direction to this attraction : stop at Jongak station (line 2. exit 6), walk 250 m, take bus 5500-1, stop at KFV 3-Way Intersection, and walk 1 km towards KFV (Don't forget to mention your destination to the driver, Minsokchon).Instagram : @adjimantoro"
Traditional Korean experience,"This is a must see place for those who want to experience traditional Korea. It is located in Suwon which is reacheable by Seoul metro. It is advisable to take a subway at around 0815 am from central Seoul, It takes about 60 minutes to reach Suwon. As you exit "
Take a look at the traditional Korea,"This place is easy to get there by free bus from Suwon Station about 20 min. When we got there, weather is very nice and leaves turn yellow already. This place is very big and suitable for friends and family having outdoor camping. Entrance fee is KRW15,000/pax - quite reasonable. You will see a lot of Korean wearing hanbok to suite with surrounding. I feel like becoming an actress in traditional Korea movie and drama."
Its Original ,"You must visit KFV if its your 1st time in korea. You wont regret. you can Reach KFV fr Seoul by bus or train. I took train bcs it was weekend, so its very possible traffic jam on route. Stop in Suwon station, and continue with bus no. 37. (when reach suwon, i was shocked to found no tourist information ppl can speak english. they were old ladies. while in front of the door they put big poster ""Visit Year 2016 Tourist information"" thanks to old ladies tried hardly to explain in korean language the number of the bus.) it takes around 30 minutes from Suwon station to KFV bus stop. Admission fee is 15000 Krw for adult. Its cheap for bunch interesting things inside. once you go inside its like blast to the past. touch and feel the atmosphere of the pastthe original feeling of korea "
OMG so many school groups,"We went on a rainy Tuesday and there were so many school groups! Maybe 100 buses in the car park! Thousands of primary school kids running around with umbrellas right at decapitation height, makes it hard to appreciate the history. Place is massive and well laid out with plenty of food options. The shows were all cancelled due to the rain which was a bummer. We took a taxi from suwon city hall area and it cost W11000. If needing a cab to go home the tourist office near the ticket office will call one for you. If going on a school day maybe go a bit later in the day when school groups are going home."
"Very interesting and unique place, far from downtown",This is a unique place where you get to learn about Korean history and lifestyle over the centuries. Live actors and plenty of performances throughout the day keep everyone's interest up in the group. Great for families and people looking to get out and explore. About 90 minutes via private transportation--be aware of rush hour times headed there and coming back.
A culture point of Korea,"If you want research culture of Korea, this is a best place. In special occasion, have so many culture activities..."
Korean Folk Village,"This is a living history museum, great for family, kids, or solo travelers. It has actual dwellings showing more than one time frame. There is entertainment and plenty of eating options. It is a sizable area, has a children's area, too. It rained part of the day so our shoes got a little wet and muddy, but then the sun came out and it was beautiful. If you want to see Korean history this is the place to go."
Plan for a full day!,"We were a group of about 50 people (mostly kids) but only had a couple hours to spend touring the grounds. It was plenty (more than enough) time for the kids - but not near enough for the adults. We got to see part of a traditional wedding ceremony, traditional houses, a rice field, oxen, people dressed in Hanbok and other traditional clothing, a few people making various items - and so much more we didn't get to see. Although it was a very hot day, the folk village is set up under a canopy of shade trees, which made it comfortable. There was also a small amusement park, several restaurants/food stalls, and souvenir shops."
A full day visit,"It is located at Yongin City which is about more than 2 hours away from Seoul via public transportation. You need to reserve one day to fully explore this place.We went there this summer so it was quite hot. There are open cottages where you can stay for a bit to rest, so it wasn't so bad. Just be sure to remove your shoes before coming in. Admission is 15,000KRW per adult, but you can pay 24,000KRW per adult if you wish to go to the amusement park."
"For a fan of Sungkyunkwan Scandal, it is a dream come true.","I am a K-drama fan, not particularly interested in historical dramas but I do love watching Sungkyunkwan Scandal. That was why I visited the Korean Folk Village and I was not to be disappointed. Love the reality of the village and how beautiful the landscaping was. Absolutely love the trees. Truly felt like I was in the past, enjoying a stroll around a real Korean village. My friend and I had a good time watching the wedding reenactment and also enjoyed the horseback riding performance. And the icing on the cake was to take pics at the actual Sungkyunkwan Scandal shooting location. Yum!"
A must visit for historical k-drama's lovers,"Many historical k-dramas were shot in this place. Coming to here is like being in the drama itself. I could immediately recognize some places in the drama. In the same time, I learned about the past lifestyle of Korean people. "
Excellent One day in Korea,This is my very first time to Korea with my family. We are quite big family with 12 people. The itinerary was very well planned and thoughtful considering kids. And I could feel how much their organizer consider every single person of our group. It was hassle free and our guide Ms.Jane was excellent and kids friendly person. We fully enjoyed our trip thanks to Sweetravel Korea. I will definitely recommend this company who wants to visit Korea! Thumbs up.
Korean folk ,If you want to spend day as Korean folk must be you going there ... You will forget your self and live with Korean folk in all thinks ... Really one of the best place in Korea 
The must visit you should do while in Seoul,"This place is amazing. Although a little far from the city center you can reach it easily by bus and train. This place is full of history and it has such an energy that it is difficult not to be overwhelmed. Houses from all over Korea had been brought to this area so that you can have a taste of how they lived from the beginning up to just around 50 years ago. There are a lot of activities that you can do - pottery, sculptures, etc. You can also watch a wedding ceremony and many other attractions."
MUST GO if you like culture and history,"Seoul is a nice place for women to shop.However, this is the only place that i highly recommend if you like to know more about Korea culture and history.Besides, their simple Korea foods is delicious with reasonble price.In addition, all their performance ia very interesting and good and you wont feel bore at all.Worth to visit here. Will definitely come here again but will bring kids along to let them learn somethings in Korea."
Step back in Korean culture,This is like traveling back in time to the Joseon dynasty. You can see the practices of feng shui in the houses. This folk village focuses on Korean customs. They had many cultural performances that are performed throughout today. One is a traditional wedding ceremony and another is Korean dancing and music. There's also a spot towards the front of the full village that you can leave a wish on rice paper. 
Must visit,I visited several times when I lived in Korea. Great place to learn about Korean history and way of life. Everyone in the family enjoyed it. The bird-call water whistles are a great souvenir.
Very educational indeed,As a tourist I find this place very educational and lovely to visit.The South Koreans are so blessed and fortunate that they have this place to educate them on their history and roots.Saw many young children on school excursions and definitely a sense of pride on each of these children's face when their educators narrated to them all that they are proud of.A variety of local produce can be found here at reasonable prices.Definitely a must visit for families with children.
Good experience with special character,"C1 ( 2016.06.21 ) I and my friend visited there for historical experience. I've been there about 30 years ago, and remember a little about atmosphere. The facility was old and so-so, I think. But the various charater person and experience was excellent. Because we visited there in weekday, so there was very quiet. Though I liked to enjoy quietly, too quiet. I recommend to visit there in weekend, because all event was proceed in weekend and all character was not there in weekday."
My husband enjoys,We had a lovely day here. Expecially house riding show was amazing. Free shuttle bus from SU WON St. If you visit korea highly recommend this place. (Good education for children as well)
The name says it all,"I thoroughly enjoyed walking through the village and experience the feeling of historical Korea. There are many houses and even a museum to explore. The best part for me is the beautiful outdoor grounds, which includes childhood games such as group skipping rope, ring throwing, etc. So much fun watching and imagining how people in ancient Joseon times spend their days. We were lucky to watch a showcase of how marriage ceremonies were carried out."
Fun place to learn Korean history and culture,"I loved this place. I went in winter so it was very quiet and some shops were not operating. However, there are many historical buildings and a fun acrobat and horse show. The shows can't be missed, although explanations are only in Korea they are still very entertaining. Signs are also in English so you will understand the history of the buildings. Food prices in the park are a bit high but not horrible (especially by US standards). The setting by the mountains is beautiful (even in winter-in spring it must be awesome). Plan a whole day here."
Awesome,"Suitable for those who love history. Supplements one who had visited Beijing's Forbidden City, another piece of history chapter to learn. Very exciting... if one watches the old Korean drama, this will come to mind."
Good view into the past,A great place to visit especially for those who need more hands on viewing and less reading.The location of some old Joseon K-dramas too this makes a great place to get a good feel of korean life. 
Not what i expected,It wasn't exactly what I expected but I still had fun. I think i hyped it up too much before the visit but enjoyed tasting the rice wine and seeing some of the history even though i did understand everything
"Traditional houses and some history, disturbed by new things","I was in that park for about 4 hrs and it was interesting to see the houses from different regions of Korea. Unfortunately there are some other things like amusement area for kids, performances like in an old family circus and pop musik really disturbung the traditional atmosphere. It seems that the park management tries to attract younger people with more thrill which isn't really one, to rate those. I guess weekdays afternoon might be the best time: young schoolkids may have left the park and you can enjoy historical atmosphere with some spots to sit down and hang out. Stay away from the performances and the kiddie zone, if you go there to see history."
Feels like in ancient Korea ,"From Seoul to Korean folk village. Traveling via subway then shuttle bus took us at least more than an hour. Despite of the long travel our visit to the folk village was fun and educational. We learned a lot about the ""old Korea"". It was a day filled with photo-ops, watching traditional shows, and walking....Everything spells old Korea, including the staff, they wore the costumes.... The food served by the restaurants there was also traditional....Watching the 4 shows is an absolute must. The farmer dance, equestrian show, b-boy and wedding ceremony..... What I don't like in the village is that everything is in the Korean language, so I suggest renting their audio guide to understand more... The workshops would be fun... If they're free, you have to pay for all the workshops, which was not written or indicated in the brochure (only 3 workshops were indicated that they were paid) so I was disappointed to find out all workshops are paid...."
Neat Place!,"Clean & well kept. Neat area to visit, just nice for a late afternoon walk with photo shops in front that offer traditional costumes."
Experience pioneer Korea,"Great spot to appreciate the old Korean lifestyle. Samples of farmer peasant life, noble men, scholars homes - a real variety, all depicted in period build. Lots of styles to appreciate. Good descriptions on sign posts & period costume dress characters thru out. From fortune teller hut to mask making, there was something for everyone. The food court offered traditional Korea fare as well as soups and meat on a skewer. We tried roasted chestnuts - from the grill, served in a paper bag. Gals dressed up in a traditional Hanbok & we took lots of pictures. There is a kiddy amusement park, that is an extra charge. Great way to spend the day. Took in the farmers dance as well as a traditional wedding ceremony demo - the high wire acrobatics was cancelled due to windy weather. The horse show was a bit pathetic - scrawny horses & small ring. All was included in the entry fee. "
Fun,"It's a fun and informative place at the same time, I was lucky to go there with a Korean guide who explained all the customs depicted in the village. There are also live performances several times per day."
A step into Korea's past,Large park with demonstrations of activities from a past dynasty. We saw the re-creation of a Korean wedding and a torture center. There is an amusement park on the grounds but we didn't make it that far. We got earphones that explained each station in the park (in English for us). 
Interesting Place,"Feels like back to 1800's traditional atmospher that help you feel how to be Korean in the past.Rebuild house model with little details of accesories and this available in Korean building from commoners house, school to high official buildingsIf you come in the morning you will be able to see different performances started from 10am, if not there would be the last set of performances at 2pm."
Educational place where you can see traditional Korean houses,"There are few Korean houses that you can enter, but be careful not to enter houses with real occupants. We were scolded by grandma who lives in one of the houses when we tried to enter the house thinking it was for visitors. The place is not that big, just 15-30 minutes visit is enough."
Love the shows!,"We learn a lot about Korean history here. The way Koreans live in the past, their rooms, how the Kings punish the people who disobey his commands or did bad things.We also enjoy the 3 shows that we were able to watch - the jumping rope, the riding of horses and the wedding. We are really impressed most especially the jumping rope and the riding of horses!!!"
New Years Celebration,"I went to the Korean Folk Village a few days after the Lunar New Year. It was such a great trip! We learned so much, got to experience the houses and saw some great performances. I recommend going to the folk village because everyone of all ages will have fun!"
Traditional Korean Folk Village,"Built in the 1970's, this village was constructed to an an attraction and educational area to show what traditional Korean village was like. It's very well done. There are structures that show the peasant life, farmer's houses, as well as the homes that were built in the northern part and southern part of Korea due to the differences in annual weather patterns.There is also buildings constructed for large land owners and a nobleman. It's all very interesting to see how the different classes lived and inevitably the lower classes struggled. There is also an example of a government office.There is a great museum on the grounds and it is worth a visit. It takes you through the life of the villagers through each season. Really interesting.There is a performance area where we saw a traditional dance. As well throughout the village there are people dressed in period costume and they are very accomodating to have their photos taken with you.There are also !it's of activities for children including an amusement park.The grounds are very picturesque with many good photo opportunities."
Unique place,"Explore the life in a Korean village. Very interesting with acrobatic show, traditional wedding and many ancient life forms in the countryside as was 200 years ago. Highly recommended (!)"
Going back in time,"A good place to get immerse with the Korean culture as well as to discover how the Koreans lived during 100s years ago. Getting there is not easy unless you know how. Let me offer two ways of getting there -1. Take the Blue Line 1 to Suwon Station. Take Exit 4 to lead you out. Look out for the Tourist Info Centre (TIC) which is on your left side as you walk out in the big building. AK Plaza is next to it. TIC provides free shuttle to the Korean Folk Village (KFV). If you miss the shuttle, you could take Green Bus No. 37 to KFV which takes about an hour. TIC is very helpful to offer you guidance on how to get there if you missed the free shuttle.3. The other way is to catch Bus 5001-1 from Gangnam Station which you bring there.It is better to get there early say 10am as it is a big place to cover and there are many scheduled performances. Do avoid Mondays as many activities are rested. We managed to catch the horse riding and traditional wedding ceremony performances. There are many traditional Korean houses showcasing the lives during their times. Autumn will be a good time to visit when the colorful hues of the leaves bring the best mood. There is a river running across the Village which makes good photo shoots.Getting back is easy. Instead of going back to Suwon, you could take Bus 5001-1 (red color bus) to Gangnam Station, abt an hour or less. From the KFV entrance, walk straight toward the carpark heading to the white apartment in the distance with 3 columns - abt 8-10 mins walk. When you reach the bus stop (DO NOT CROSS TO THE OPPOSITE SIDE), you could see the white Apartment Block No. 101. Wait for the red bus 5001-1. Internal around 15 mins.Have FUN!!!"
Language barrier ,I would love it more if they have more information in English. The best part is they have a kids Park by the end.
K-drama fan ? or traditional things seekers,"This attractions gets more and more popularity even for young locals since they are hiring funny dressed part time employees such as ghosts and beggars and many other. And you can even encounter K-drama stars who are filming over there. Who know you will see Kim, Su-hyun over there ? :)))) "
You will learn more about Korea by visiting this place,"This place shows customs and lifestyles of Korean past generation.....place have been carefully preserved and restored to provide visitors with a broad understanding of Korean food,home,culture,traditions, clothing, hairstyle and how people of the past live....it's a must visit place....better to take the whole day and enjoy looking and strolling along the place....there are lots of restaurant inside....they also have a few performance which is a must see....Farmer's music & dance, master of arts performance to walk on a tightrope,historical martial arts on horseback with fully of bravery and spirit and lastly the traditional wedding ceremony...."
Our Favorite Place to Take Visitors ,"We take everyone who visits us in Korea here. It is about an hours drive from Seoul. Get there early (winter: 10am, summer 9am). Get full admission if you want to go to the very small amusement park (perfect for kids 5-14 or so) . After you get in, go straight to the performance (middle of the park) to watch the farmers dance, then horse show. Then head to lunch at the far end of the park. Pork skewers and brulgogi bibimbap are our family's go-to lunch. After that we tend to wander through the village. Our kids love the lady who spins silk, the archery and the honey candy ""show"" . There is something for everyone here. "
A Fun Afternoon,It took 90 minutes by subway and then 40 minutes by bus to get there but we had a nice visit there. Don't go on Mondays because there is not as many things available to see. That was out only mistake.
Old Korea - lots to see,"There's much to see at the Korean Folk Village, which is some distance out of Seoul. We had a friend to drive us, but the traffic was horrendous (on a Wednesday).At the village, there are displays of the way of life in old Korea, a modern amusement area, large food court (we had a filling lunch there, and coffee to go as we walked around), souvenirs and shops, clean toilets, and people in costume.Many TV shows have been shot here, as I gather the buildings are authentic.Plus they have four very good shows, twice a day - a traditional Korean wedding ceremony; a vigorous equestrian show (with acrobatic horsemanship); an energetic traditional Farmer's Music and Dance (also with acrobatics); and a rather spellbinding tightrope walking display. All good to photograph.A good day out. Popular with locals and foreign tourists alike. Take the kids. And your video camera."
Worth a single visit.. not bad!!!,"I visited korean folk village with my family in the month of june. Fortunately, weather was good and sunny. Its huge from the inside. We saw many different performances like horse riding show which was marvelous and outstanding. The horse riders included girls also and seeing them performing so bravely was a treat to an eye. Other than horse riding show, there was a korean folk wedding. It was bit of a disappointment to me as i got bored too soon. And not only me, other people around me too started leaving in the middle of the show. Another eye candy was the farmer's dance show. It was superb and we enjoyed watching it a lot. We also got an opportunity to get ourselves clicked with them at the end of the show. After that we moved on to the rope show in which an old man was showing his talent and skills walking on the rope. It was great too. We carried our own food from home so I dont have much idea about the food services there. Korean folk village also has a small theme park which includes a haunted house (which feels not at all haunted) and many more rides for both adults and children. And there is one water ride too which is also great fun. We spent around 5-6 hours in the korean folk village. All in all a good experience but worth only a single visit."
"Excellent place, amazing experience","Visiting the Korean Folk Village is a nice experience. Nicely created village ambiance and infrastructure gives a insight into how the life would have been in the past. The horse riding performance is really good. It is good one day outing, but little bit away from Seoul/Incheon."
Back into Jaseon time,"a place where they film korea dramas of olden time, like my younger sister told me that those dramas are mellow dramas. It is just around 15000 won. They have free stuttle services at an appointed time around 4pm. It is very near Angguk station as well. If you are a fan of yesteryears culture, you will be in for an adventure. Do not miss their special performances. Me and my sisters, managed to watch the farmer's folk dance, korean traditional wedding where they bow to each other many times, and also the horse riding by the talented acrobatics. I salute one of the girl riders. Having the strength to hold herself on the horse. "
A bit far but a nice experience,"Went here with a korean friend and her oppa who have a car. Had a nice long day in the amusement park and folk village. I would recommend the 14:00 show with drums and eating inside the heated floor, sitting on the floor -type old korean hanok style spaces scattered around the food court. The haunted house was quite funny on the amusement park side.."
Excellent design of village atmosphere ,"Walking in korean village is a nice experience. Felt like in villages. Old infrastructure, environment will take us to olden days. Dance performance, walk on rope, and other activities are superb. One great thing i saw here is girls horse raiding performance, its fantastic. We can find coffee shops near by.Though its artificially designed, but environment makes you in village atmosphere except villagers. You can find only tourists here, no villagers."
Wonderful cultural experience,My boyfriend took me here and it was a fun day in the cold. It was a good cultural and educational experience to learn about history of my partners country in the old days. We had much fun exploring and taking amazing photo. There were many places to eat too. I would like to come back in warmer months. Definately worth visiting here. 
Absolutely worth seeing,We had a really good experience while visiting today. The park is huge and educational without being boring. The activities and performences are of a great quality. All in all a perfect way to spend a day at a resonable price. Not to be done on a rainy day.
pictures everywhere,"this is a really nice place if you are interested to experience or to see the history of korea, which i really love. i am a korean drama fan, and i am so happy because most of the drama were shoot here. i feel like i am back in the days of korea. it is really a cool place. it is very big, you can also do a lot of activities here. they have games that they are playing before. foods are everywhere. you will be able to also people around dress in their native clothes. it really cool. i love the place. i sure you will love it too. if you are interested in history don't go."
Ancient Korea,"Amazing Experience, in some sense same as villages of India. but due to culture difference and Food difference, everything seems Irrelevant but still close to the heart.The other side of the Ancient Korea. This place is Amazing. you will feel Korea now is different but at some point, all of the villages in Asia were same (I don't know about non-Asian haven't visited any), There lifestyle everything was exactly the same.Enjoy Amazing Pottery or Doll making. Thumbs up will visit again."
Fun visit,Nice place to get some of the history of the area! Take the time to visit here and see how people lived in years past.
Huge!,"The place is huge. We spent hours here. We watched all of the attraction being offered that day, from the farmers dance, the tight rope walking, and the horse back riding, all fascinating. People gathered and enjoyed the performances despite the minus temp in winter which is extremely cold.We also enjoyed having lunch at the Bazaar where they have so many menus to choose from. They provide open air seating and indoor seating with ondol, the heated floor system. Finally, my kids enjoyed the snow sledding and playing in the play park. A must visit place for tourist when in Korea."
Very interesting even though it was cold.,A Korean friend and colleague wanted to take a group of us from around the world and we absolutely loved it even if it was a bit cold. So many interesting things to see and experience there. I highly recommend it to anyone who likes historical places to go see it.
Great Village,It was just so wonderful. Everyone there was great. I had the best time visiting there. I will diffidently go back again. 
Very far - not ideal to visit during Winter,"I wanted to visit a place with korean traditional houses and a place for the kids with sledding so KFV fits the bill. However the place is southwards from central Seoul, took us more than 1.5 hours on train rides (with multiple transfers) and another 45 mins bus ride. Total time spent close to 2.5hrs! Due to winter and temp is about -5deg, the park is extremely quiet except for a small group of kindergarten kids on excursion. Most of the rides and sledding are closed, huge disappointment for the kids. The Korean village is nicely done, very nice background for phototaking. Unfortunately due to the weather and to catch the last shuttle at 4.30pm. We left after spending only 2 hrs at KFV. Not going there again!Important: please take the free shuttle KFV bus with designated timings instead of the public bus. The distance to KFV by free shuttle bus is about 20mins. We missed the shuttle and took public bus 37 from Suwon Station exit 4. The public bus took more than 30-45mins to reach KFV. "
Korean Folk Village - a 30 minutes bus ride from Seoul,"A beautiful, historical, filming location, live attractions for both adults & kids will surely love this attraction. They also have so many fascinating traditional culture performances with horse rides, folk dancing, wedding ceremonies . I love the Historical Drama, Movies Film location and pictures of the stars that I love.A peaceful walk around the little lake to see those traditional thatched folk houses - a lot of things to enjoy.I love Korean Folk Village."
Back to the past,"A stroll back to the past, enjoy the past with beautiful photos to remember the past of Korea. Beautiful scenery during autumn time. "
Fascinating life in the older days,"This is a must visit place. Very interesting life sytle in the older days. Even the roof top of the houses are different, some made of stone, clay and hay...you get to see their bag pack in the older days, the way they iron cloths, the kimchi 'fridge', etc...they have people selling things made the older days ways. You can just walk around and see how the houses were in the older days. At certain hours (please check out the time at the entrace), they have folk dance, rop walking, horse riding show. The show are very interesting to watch. They also have areas where kids can play with the older days toys, rop jumping, play with hays, etc. There are restaurants if you're hungry and ice cream or snacks shacks if you just want to munch while walking."
One of my favorite places,"I've taken my Taekwondo students on tours here and always received positive reviews. The variety of attractions, history and food make it a great destination for all visitors. I think it is among my favorite places in Korea. Convenient, enjoyable and a good value."
Fantastic ,"It is one hour away from the city and almost near Everland theme park . The village gives you a very nice picture of old way of life of Koreans. You can walk through the village and peep into every single cottage . You can understand how the traditions have been , how the rulers were governing the people. The peasant huts, the physicians place, the fortune tellers place and all are being exposed to the visitors. This the place where there are many shootings of the movies. You can also see a lot of school children coming to this place . One of the amazing places in the small stream of water which is flowing through the village. It is one the best photo stops in the village."
Might be better in good weather,"We visited this place on cold rainy winter. Thus, we didn't really enjoy ourselves. Some activities (rop walking) were cancelled due to the rain and we cut short our tour due to the cold. I believe this place will have more to offer in good weather. So check weather forecast before going there."
Wonderful Village!,"I have been to the Korean Folk Village twice, once in the early spring and once in the summer and I must say while both visits were nice the summer visit was much better! The colors and vibrancy of the village come alive when everything was green. If you have not been to the Korean Folk Village before I would definitely suggest you do. Make sure you catch the special events throughout the day!"
Fun and exciting !,The folk village shows us life in the 18th century where korea was full of villages and towns. It is really cool to see what korean houses looked like back in the day. Its also cool to see the furniture and stuff like that in the houses. The Folk village also houses a mini theme park where you take cool and adrenaline rushed-themed rides. There are also haunted houses for the braver souls. I went today and there was almost nobody so we mostly had everything to ourselves. Feel free to go along the river and see wild geese and ducks as well as a cattle in the barn and some horses which you can ride for a fee of 1000 won. Great food court with excellent and delicious korean food. Overall its really a great day out. 
Enjoyed the procession,Was interesting to watch and learn more about Korea History and culture and tradtion through the dance and march and of cos the colourful traditional outfit.I had fun taking pictures and video recording the different segments of the tour
Time Capsule,"Other than tourists who were not ""dressed"" in traditional attire, the whole village makes you feel that you have travelled back in time. It is easy to get there from Seoul. Take the 30-min KTX from Seoul station to Suwon, walk towards the tourist information center which is at Exit 4 of Suwon Subway. You can ask the staff in the directions to Hwaseong Fortress too. There is a free shuttle in front of Exit 4 that brings you to Korean Folk Village. The shuttle runs on a fixed timing. We took the 1230pm to the village and took the 330pm shuttle back to Suwon as we want to visit Hwaseong Fortress. However, I would advise for those who wish to visit both places in a day to start your day early, i.e., to reach Suwon in time for the 1030am shuttle to The Korean Folk Village and return to Suwon on the 2pm shuttle, so that you can make your way to Hwaseong Fortress without rushing. I will share more in the Hwaseong Fortress review l."
informative and entertaining,"Unlike the Namsangol Folk Village, this one in Suwon had an entrance fee. It was fun watching the farmer's musical instruments performance). We would have wanted to catch the traditional wedding ceremony but we had to catch the bus to Suwon Fortress.There are dining options inside the folk village and a buddhist temple up the mountain."
Nice and calm atmosphere,"It was an interesting visit with my friends. We enjoyed watching Korean traditional dance there; and also took a lot of beautiful pictures. If you want to know more about Korean traditional culture, you should come visit here."
Traditional,"Sometimes they dance, they do some traditional things here. You should come here if you want to know some of korean traditional."
Experience the Village Life of Korea,"Korean Traditional Folk Village of Yonging, Gyeonggi-do province preserves the traditional village life-style of late Joseon period. Here you can see various types of village houses built according to the different styles practiced by different areas of old Korea. When you enter the folk village through the hay-covered entrance door, the feeling changes instantly as if you have traveled back in time. Every thing becomes calm and quite, highlighting how calm and peaceful the by-gone days. While meandering along the village paths you can see traditional shops, and small home-gardens. Towards the center of the village you can find the circular performance area where you can enjoy various traditional performances. I was lucky enough to witness the the Farmers' Dance and Music performance.I wish I was able to watch the tight-rope walking and acrobatics performance as well. But unfortunately since it was a Monday that performance was not held. Equestrian Feats and Traditional Wedding ceremony performances are also there. You can try your hands on various cultural experiences as well. Like making and playing Danso Flute, Riding Horses, Traditional Games etc. I tried to play Danso flute which proved to be quite difficult. Korean Folk Village has served as a background for number of Korean Dramas and Movies. Dae Jung Gum (대장금), Such as You who came from Stars (별에서 온 그대), Arang and the Magistrate (아랑사또전), Rooftop Princes(옥탑방 왕세자), Warrior Baek-dong So (무사 백동수), Moon that Embraces the Sun (해를 품은 달), Queen Seondeok (선덕 여왕) and many more. You can see the drama replicas, Hand-prints of actors and actresses and Drama Scripts as well. You can try different types of Korean Food at the Bazaar area and in the Market Village area. I highly recommend you should try Sea-food and Green Onion mixed Korean Pizza !"
Worth to visit,"There is direct bus to reach the Folk Village from Suwon station,which is FOC.people who love to see the traditional building and activities in Korea can pay a visit. The entrance fees is worth the money. Head to the information center near Suwon station, u might get a promotion voucher.You can spend half day in this place. Nice view in some spot."
A peak into Korea's past - Charming Gyeonggi,"The Korea folk village is perfect destination for anyone who want to experience the typical village setting, yet so preserved in a calm atmosphere that add some fresh impetus to your curiosity. The mud houses, with some antique settings is relishing. I really enjoyed the cultural perfomances from the Farmers music troupe with my colleagues.The food is also delicious. You can eat from any of the Korean restaurants in there.It has some beautiful scenes to give you a memorable visit."
Fun times with fall colors,"Cheap way to get there is to take the 5500-1 bus from Myengdong...do not take an organized tour. The entrance fee is about 12 bucks..shows commence at 10.30 and every half hour...dances, equestrian, acrobat, and then a traditional wedding ..and if you want hip hop..well there is another one at 1pm. Nice layout fo the park, great open spaces with beautiful fall colors in Oct/Nov. nice food and souvenir shopping...makes a good half to a 3/4 day trip to get a good taste of culture of Korea and traditional houses, workshops of various Korean arts etc. I think it is fun times, colorful and a must visit for first time visitors to Seoul."
Worth a visit,"A nice place to soak in the traditional korean culture and history. Enjoyed the various performances such as acrobat on tightrope, horseback riding and traditional korean wedding. "
Step into Korea's past,"We just arrived in Seoul and first on our agenda was visiting KFV. I did some research comparing travel cost by taxi plus KFV entrance tickets VS buying a tour package, and the tour was cheaper. We pre-booked a half day tour, so we were picked up at the hotel at noon by a tour guide and driver. The trip from city center to KFV took 1 hour (1 way), the return trip took longer though due to rush hour (5 pm). KFV is such a great and practical intro for our trip to Korea. It's like taking a step into Korea's past, all in one place, done in a few hours. Plenty of interesting performances and hands on activities to be experienced. Remember to dress for the weather (in Oct we wore long sleeve tops, long pants, jackets), wear comfortable walking shoes, and pack a stroller if you're going with young children."
Beautiful,"What a nice way to get away from the big city and step into the past! I went here during Chuseok so the day was filled with dances, music, food and more. I loved every second and I think everyone visiting Korea needs to go! The real beauty is outside the hub and bub of Seoul!"
A must see spot,here you can have a look on the Korean traditional lifestyle . We went there on the Korean tour last Sep 2015 . The Temp was quite cold in the early morning but turned hot later on.Traditions sometimes are not quite interesting to the young like me but to others i guess it might be otherwise.
See life of old Korea,"Everything at the Korean Folk Village is in written Korean language, so you must have an English speaking guide with you. When you have that it is interesting to see who Koreans lived a few hundred years back."
A perfect place to learn Korean Culture & History ,"And also a great place for family outing/picnic with young kidsSuggests to bring along hat, sun block, ground sheet, and don't wear white pants"
Fun and informative,"It's a bit of a shlep from Seoul (1 hour subway, 25 mins bus/taxi) but worth it for a great day out. Over 260 buildings brought to life with friendly hosts and demonstrations of crafts. Try and make it early so you can catch all the performances."
Great place !,It was a great place to learn and see more about the Korean culture. I absolutely loved it ! And when I go back to Korea I'll definitely go there again .
Immersive experience of Korean folk culture,"If you are one of those K-drama fans, this place is a treat. Much of it is an eye opener to their culture. It is also a shoot location for some period K-drama. You may never know that your visit coincides with one.Enjoy the horseback and jutalgi performances."
Good place,I enjoyed there for the whole day .. it takes 20 minutes by taxi from dongtan city..but I don't prefer korean food.
Back in Time,"Korean Folk Village is an interesting place to visit as it takes you back in time. As one wonders through the vast village ground one can witness Korean tradition, culture and the peaceful village lifestyle they once lived in. You can have pictures taken with traditionally attired people and scheduled performance around the village enables you to witness the tradition and culture. It is very relaxing around the village and a lot of history to appreciate. There is a food court arena where one can enjoy traditional food and drinks at a reasonable price. For the children there is a section where they can be entertained with theme park attractions."
"All in one experience: Culture, Food, Horseback Martial Arts and a village","Located about 90mins south of Seoul, the Folk Village sits of a very large 245 acre site. You will need at least half a day to experience the place. Bring comfortable walking shoes. It features 260+ traditional Korean houses relocated from around the country and good feng shui with a river flowing through it and mountain behind it. It has plenty of tree cover and is peaceful even with crowds. There are lots of cultural re-enactment areas like a Blacksmith with red hot coals plying his trade making farming instruments. The village opens at 9:30am and closes 5:30pm to 6:30pm depending on the season. Most visitors wander through the villages, catch a bite to eat at the bazaar or stalls, and connect in the Performance Area where they put of fairly spectacular displays of tightrope acrobatics, and martial arts on horseback. I went on a day trip with friends by car to Suwon Hwaseong Fortress (World Heritage site) first and then to the Folk Village before heading back to Seoul"
So Much to See,"When I first moved to Korea I thought I could just walk to this little place and be alright.After about 3 miles of walking on the free way (*just moved) I finally made it to the KFV and saw that there was a shuttle bus you could catch. -_-Anywho, this village was just so big and I felt like I wasn't able to fully appreciate this place in all it's beauty. I found the temple and it was calm and peaceful. It was a little walk ways away from the rest of the village but it was lovely. There was a little pond with a flowering tree.There was a ton of beauty in the elements surrounding the village. I mean I went during the end of the winter months, so the trees were bare, but the ambiance wasn't lost on me.There was a little river that you could cross by stepping on rocks and getting to the other side like how the folks used to do. The little river or stream it was on just kept steadily flowing. The sun setting was especially nice.There was also a little area where there was information about different countries in the world. Like the highlights of each region in the continents. Displays of pottery, dummies, artifacts and the like.I would like to go again just to be able to see the performances of the actors and actresses that everyone talks about."
Ultimate place to know about Korean tradition.,"Place has an entry fee of 15000 WON(13$), but its worth. Place is full of greenery there is river flowing middle of the property. that is very beautiful. They have 4 performances in specific time slots. On is tradition acrobatics, a girl performance on a rope, horse riding acrobatics and finally a traditional Korean wedding. Place have souvenir shop and many traditional item shops. People are roaming the in traditional dresses to give you the feel of the village. They demonstrated Korean agriculture houses, life style, handicrafts and many more. I loved the place and I suggest all non Koreans to visit this place once. At the end i had 1000 years old Korean tradition food and drink (Maakoli). There is also a small amusement park, video game parlor and 4D theater. Awesome experience over all."
A must do for fans of korean history,Had a great time here with my tour group. got to learn a lot about korean culture from older times. so much to see and do. wonderful backdrops for pics. TONS of food options as well. very reasonable prices
Excellent experience and price is reasonable ,"This folk village has it all for a day trip. The kids can make pottery and paint traditional Korean wood items etc for extra cost, however it's reasonable. There are shows at various times showing Korean traditional music, wedding ceremony, horse riding etc. the food is also quite good quality and reasonably priced. There are crowded areas and quite areas such as the Buddhist temple. Really worth a visit if you're in more of only to understand more clearly the rapid development of South Korea. "
A Wonderful Living Museum- Must See Destination For Any Visitor!,"This was my favorite place of all the destinations visited during my short 3 day trip to Korea, especially if you are a fan of traditional Korean movies and series. It was like a living museum for anyone interested in learning and experiencing Korean traditional culture. You can experience a traditional wedding, battles, and other cultural shows while enjoying photo-ops in the backdrop of ancient buildings, the filming site for many historical dramas. There is a also a museum section that displays various aspects of Korea's rich history and culture. From central Seoul, you can take a direct bus to Gyeonggi Do which takes you almost directly to the Folk Village. I connected the 5001 bus from Gangnam but am sure there are many other routes."
An experience especially for children.,Wonderful opportunity for children to experience traditional Korean culture and lifestyle. A great introduction for those new to Korean culture and civilization.
"""Beautiful place to visit""",Went in June and the weather was perfect. We stayed for most of the day started our journey on the train for 45 min from Seoul Station hopped on the bus for about 20 minutes. Wear walking shoes. Enjoyed the traditonal houses and the gardens. The traditonal performances were nice and especially the tight rope walking. We watched all the shows and then went to the section where they have filmed historical drama's. They have cut outs of some of the actors had to take a few pictures since I know who the actors are since I am a huge drama fan!!
Great place to wander ,"This place is huge. It needs at least three hours to enjoy their shows. We had a wonderful time to walk around the place. Because our visit was in the midst of MERS outbreak, we enjoyed a very rare occasion that the village was not packed with tourists. Even it is packed, it is worth the visit. "
A huge garden,"April and September are good timing to visit Korean Folk Village to enjoy its beautiful trees and flowers. I like to go there in September, when there are perfect autumn leaves everywhere."
Korean Folk Village,"Free village for tourist. Nice scenery, good place for photos. will be better if there's tour guide available to tell us abt the history on korea. "
A must to visit,"This was my second visit to the Folks Village.First one was about 10 years ago, and I was not quite impressed.Just traditional houses with interesting traditional performances now and then.This place has been changed a lot, much more relaxed and enjoyable.Feels like more old style buildings and more attraction activities are added.Plan the whole day for the trip and just wander around through the beautiful houses. Watching different performances sitting on a stone seated stadium was also excellent. It was pity that the comments were only in Korean, but the performances were truly amazing and really enjoyable, almost makes you wanting to join them on a stage.I was reluctant to go there again, but one of my friend recommended very strongly. I am glad I listened."
Good way to learn about Korean culture,"Had a free day in South Korea and decided to visit the Korean Folk Village. It is nicely set up, with village homes from different parts of Korea. There are four shows, the horses and their riders is the most action packed show; the traditional wedding is cultural and good to watch. We had a good meal in the food court. There is plenty of shade all around. There are places to rest if one gets tired. There is also something for young kids. Overall a good way to learn about the culture. Glad we went."
Great History Lesson,This is a great place to check out if you know very little of Korean history. Plus the scenery is beautiful! There is a little amusement park on site if you have little ones. Not really much for older kids though. 
Spend a day to there to enjoy the Korean Culture,"Buy the basic ticket without the rides. There are constant shows and exhibit of the Korean culture. If you enjoy historical K-drama, many of the shows were film there. Many employees are dressed in the era and they look beautiful. You really get to appreciate the Korean culture."
Travel back in time,"Last May 31, we had our group tour in Yongin Folk Village. From Daejeon, it took us approximately 1h and 40 mins to reach the place. This folk village is where the famous Korean dramas, such as Jang Geum (sorry, i am not sure about the title, though), were shot.The village offers traditional games, historical museums and cultural shows like acrobatics on a tight rope, wherein a Korean grandpa (할아버지) performs amazing stunts while crossing to the other side. As for me, the horse back riding show was the best! It was my first time to see performers do stunts while riding horses. It's a must see event. Overall, it was a time well spent in the folk village. Should you decide to know more about Korean culture and history in a fun way, this place is right for you."
Great Place to understand old Korea,This is a must a see if you want to understand a little about old Korea. There are good restaurants and good souvenir shops in the village. There are several skits around the village showing the different type of living structures and performances showing some of the old traditional costumes and dance.
"This was a great place, very worth the trip","This place was an hour south of Seoul and we debated not going, but we were very glad we did. It's very impressive.It's a very large facility with tons of buildings, opportunities to learn, see, and experience first hand. The place is set up to feel like you are walking back in time to the Joseon Dynasty. It has over 250 traditional Korean houses. There is a farmer's house, a nobleman's mansion, scholar's house, and more. The signs help you understand why things were designed the way they were and give info about where women and guests slept or how a house on Jeju island was different than many other parts of the country.There were performances every half hour with a break between 12 and 2pm. We saw the traditional farmers dance which had the men wearing hats with long ribbons on them, it was very impressive. They also had a horse show which was pretty cool though my son lamented that they were standing on the horses and it's not good for their backs.They had a prison where my son pretended to be a prisoner, sample backpacks for us to try one, There were some farm animals there, like donkeys. One thing my 8 year old really liked was the tool used for digging that was a see saw and used your entire body weight to work. There were several restrooms, a few places to buy food and drinks, a very large souvenir shop and quite a few hands on experiences like making a rice bag or dying cloth.Right by the folk village across a river with many bridges is an amusement park area but we did not go there so I can't comment.Hours vary by season so be sure to check. Prices were about $15 for adults and $10 for kids. Free wheelchairs are available and strollers were available for rent for a small fee. I highly recommend making the trip to visit this village if you are visiting Seoul."
The Disneyland of Korea,"My father and I went to this amusement place in April of this year. We had a great time. A place where you can learn and see how South Korean people lived, worked, and played in their village. The lines for food can be long, but worth the wait. They serve a variety of home style favorites."
rare experience,"Worth the hours touring and watching four activities of the village. Entertaining. Truly fascinated to learn about history , background and culture of Korea during Joseon dynasty. "
It's just fun!!!!!,"Recently I visited the Korean folk village with my family. It was a beautiful experience. The village has rides, a Ghost house, houses of Korean style, stalls if u wish to buy ingredients for a Chinese tea, a stall which provides traditional Korean dresses on rent etc. Koreans may not hv an issue with the food but Indians will, since I am an Indian too, so u can carry ur foodstuff there....there are several huts depicting the lives of the people of Jeju and China..Do try the roasted chestnuts there.. They taste lovely.. Also do not miss the wedding ceremony and other activities.. It's definitely a great place.. So enjoy.."
Good Date,I went here with a boyfriend and we had a nice time touring the different Korean houses from various time periods and locations. Everything is pretty peaceful and there is a very nice food court area to try different Korean traditional meals. It's a nice chance to experience some Korean culture and history.
A folk village with a amusement park attached,"Large folk village with a few animals, temple, and korean and western eateries. I actually like the amusement park, especially for the kids. Mini free fall ( 3 stories ), pirate ship swing, bumper cars and mini roller coaster (too short off a ride). Big crowds on weekends but everyone is polite like the rest of Korea.There is the basic ticket (folk village) or the combo pack which lets you ride all the ""rides"". Fun enough for most adults when you're with your kids.The events at the folk village I saw were the impressive horse riding skills and the rope walker. I hope he was wearing a cod piece or some protection because he regularly trampolined himself onto the narrow rope there.We ate at the hamburger/hot dog joint. Not for our palettes. We ate at the back large open area where you buy meal tickets and then give it to the ajimas behind the counter. MMmm, kinda disappointing chicken soup, red bean porridge and soon tubu. Kinda missing that secret sauce that I got all over Korea except here. But, what do can you expect at a tourist place. I think the koreans were more let down than me since they eat the stuff regularly.Best meal was at a side stand grilling pork on a stick.Best time was seeing my daughter dress up in a hanbok. There is a little costume room for that. A small charge but worth the happy grin on her face.The crowds, the crowds, my goodness the vehicle traffic it created upon arrival/departure. We KTX's from Seoul and taxied over. Suwon traffic is hellacious on a Sunday early afternoon. We bused back to the KTX and though it was slow, the people/sight watching was fantastic as the bus stopped every 5 blocks.I could spend much more time at this village and would come back again despite being here twice in 20 years."
Enriching place,"Having a tour guide to bring you around here is good. Place filled with history and culture. Traditional korean games are also available in the folk village ( you can practically play it with the whole family )Shows are available every few hours eg traditional wedding ceremony or the folk dance on the rope.If you are hungry, they have many food stalls to choose from. ( didnt really try the food there) They sell traditional cakes and musical instruments too.Plus point: Musollah is available for muslim visitors:)"
Good History lesson ,"This folk village gives a nice a historical perspective of old Korea. Interesting displays in the museum detailing the importance of food, the seasons. And hierarchy within the old village. It's got an amusement park for kids, which would help them maintain interest. Recommended, if you have time. I had a private tour with a good English-speaking friend. Danno says, ""Book it!"" "
Cool to see,"We watched all four of the shows and thought all of them ( except for the wedding ceremony...we dont speak korean) to be very entertaining.We did not do any of the workshops because I was sick and tired, but the atmosphere was nice and peaceful.We ate at one of the restaurants there. My bone soup was pretty bland and my boyfriend didnt care for his bibimbop either.The bus ride out there is long and can be somewhat difficult if you don't speak korean. If you have a spare day, I do think it is worth seeing."
Great insight to Korean History and Culture,"We came here on an organised tour. There are so many different buildings from different areas and eras of Korea gave a great insight to how Korea has developed.There are several shows in the day which are highly worthwhile, one dancing one and one with horses and acrobatics both are very good. We had a guide which made understanding the culture and buildings much better, was defiantly a good way to enjoy the village.Really worthwhile and take a few hours out here."
Check the timings of the shows before going,"I would strongly recommend that you check the free shuttle bus timings and show timings when you are planning a trip there by ITX: http://www.koreanfolk.co.kr/multi/english/event/perform_guide.asp?gb=nongak. Unfortunately we missed the performances, only caught a glimpse of the horse riding show. If you plan to take ITX to Suwon, you can catch the free shuttle bus to KFV, which takes 30 mins. The tourist information centre advised that it will take 1 hour by public bus."
Best of both worlds - walk the history and a great theme park,"Walking through the history of ancient Korean is fun (some games of the past) and entertaining (few shows - archery on horse back, wedding proceedings, etc). Young children will enjoy the great theme park without queue (unlike the other theme parks which u spent more time queuing). Remember to buy the Pass to cover the theme park."
Wonderful replicated village of Joseon Dynasty,"Despite the cold and wind, we really enjoyed this Korean Folk Village. Seeing how the Koreans lived during the Joseon Dynasty was interesting. In addition we were treated to farmers folk dancing, a tightrope walk, and martial arts on horseback. All of it was in Korean but well worth the entertainment and visual images."
"Experience Korean Traditional, Culture & Food","Very BIG folk village in Yongin, not far from Seoul. Get a lot of experience about Korean culture, traditional & food here. A lot of original Korean food to taste, traditional arts & crafts for souvenir, experience some traditional performance - some you can join it. More over, if you wanna see 'Cherry blossom', you should come around mid April."
Good Historical place in korea.,Nice place for a full day.We can see korean culture.Good performances.Museum abt korean life stlye and culture.Suggestion to vegeterians carry food your self. U get only korean food.
"Third time going to Seoul, regretted not coming here initially","I never knew this place existed since I only searched for places at Seoul. This location maybe a bit far from Seoul, but its still accessible.Since Im a huge K-drama fan, I really love this place. All of my memories were brought back when I went to this place.Its just sad that when we arrived here it as raining. However it never stopped us from going around this place. Will definitely come back when the weather is sunnY!"
MUST GO!,"We went there during winter, so you can imagine how cold it is while watching the performances. Dont miss the show, its twice a day. We arrive just in time for the performances and its so fun and entertaining. The place is big, so you should spent at least half a day here. I wished I am not with group so I can wander around. Everything here is interesting. The setting, the atmosphere....I would definitely come here again. Not with a tour group this time."
Great performances,"We visited during winter. Not many visitors. We happened to be in time for 3 outdoor performances (traditional drums and percussion, acrobatic performance on rope, horse riding) which happened almost back to back. Despite the cold, the performers did a great and admirable job.There was an amusement park located just beside the village, which for an additional cost, provided some additional fun for the kids (snow sledding, carousel, mini pirate boat, etc)."
a different kind of beauty,"went during winter in December 2014. the place was partially cover with snow which make everything so photo-worthy. there are shows available at certain timing which were entertaining and breath-taking. not easy to visit this place since not reachable using metro. we paid a day tour for this with an English guide. although it is a little expensive, but the guide explanation was detailed. the guide told us some history on every spot he wanted us to see. he then compared with the old days vs the modern korea to make us understand better. there are traditional korean games that were played in the older days that we can have our hands on. honestly, we had a lot of fun on the games. we have a little competition with other tourists too.if you have 4 hours to spare, I think the visit to this special place is a must no matter which season of Korea. since different season you see different kind of beauty in the scenery."
Cultural trip,"Folk village with all the traditional house for you to see. Not to visit during winter, not much activites available."
A must-go folk village for 1st-timers in Korea,we visited this place in Dec 2013 and it was during chilly winter. The experience was indescribable as the landscape and little huts were something u dont get to see in city areas. Korean drama lovers like myself are sure to love the place and can take lots of photos there.
Nice place to visit with the family.,"It is a nice place to visit to know more about the old Korean life style.In the folk village, there are some shows and some activities to do. It is a nice place to bring the children as well."
"""experience old korea in 1 day""","From suwon train station ,you can find the tourist information counter outside the station,suwon is a big station cos there are ktx,itx ,mugunhwa train and subway etc coming to this station.you can get more information from this counter to place of interest in suwon.There are shuttle service to KFV and return trip.Like us we have missed the 10 am and 12 noon bus ,The fastest way to reach KFV is by the new Bundang line train then transfer to bus.Take bundang line to sangal(7 stop from suwon) and transfer to public bus no.37.the bus will go quite near to the entrance ,1 min by foot to the entrance ,Entrance fees is 15,000 won .It is beautiful and cold in autumn ,went there on sunday and it was packed with local tourist and many children.many good spot to take picture and certain spot remind you of certain scene in K drama.There are restaurant ,coffee ,snack stall along the way,there are also rental of costume booth for those who wish to be 'emperor or queen' for 30min,for kids there are also some games that they can participate ,there are also some animals,i saw cow and horses.There are also performances examples wedding,farmers festival etc you can check with the tourist information counter or KFV web site. for more details.overall in my opinion is worth the visit ,you can experience different culture ,see some performances ,play some 'ancient game' and autumn scenery is beautiful .will recommed to people who don't have much time to explore other part of korea but just have a overall idea of ancient korea look like.i have been to hahoe village in andong ,some part do remind me of that village."
Like a Korean Disney!!!!,"It's big! Great food! Great shopping! Great entertainment and live! I recommend find a map, find the river and cross it on top of the stones. Oh great point... go to the area of the Korean Drama .. have you seen and love ""My love from another star""? Must go there!!! It was filmed parts there."
the fastest way to learn about Korean culture,"When to visit with my friends , great place as all of us enjoy every moment there.We when there by bus, quite a long journey as it take around 2 hours and it was jammed. Better to take the subway to reach there earlier. For Korean drama lovers, this place is for you guys"
Like going back in time!,"I came with Seoul City Tour, and this was our last destination. We got here on time for the traditional Korean Dance performance. It was interesting to watch. There was a village of the old days on display to show how villagers lived in those days. Many Korean Dramas were filmed here. The Korean National Costumes were also available for hire for photographs. An interesting place to visit."
Great place to spend your day with family,"Went a visit with family, great place, great performances and fantastic treats. A must for those loves Korean Drama where you can see lots from your most favorite scenes. It's not very easy to get there but my suggestion is to hire a car from Seoul and drive yourself there."
Full day worth spending,"By subway, I stop at Suwon station. I reach Suwon Station around 9 am, and I took local bus to Korean Folk Village. Just check the bus number at Tourist Information Centre near to Suwon Subway station. By this bus, KFV is the last station, so you don't have to worry about where to stop or if you have to carefully listening to the announcement in the bus. The journey is about 40-50 minutes.To put it simply, you will be able to visit all parts of old Korea in 1 full days. This place display all type of Korean houses, stores, temples & buildings from each and every part of Korea. I was informed that they will have live shows everyday but to my bad luck, some shows were cancelled on the day of my visit due to weather / wind conditionJust come here, spend your full day here and you'll love it."
Living museum demonstrating the life of the Korean villagers,"A huge village built to demonstrate how the villagers in Korea live, how houses, temples, and other places in a typical Korean village look like. Hence, it is a living museum. Also they demonstrate a horseback riding show, a farmers band dance and music show and a tightrope walking show along with a traditional wedding ceremony twice a day. All of these shows, especially the wedding, should be seen. Other than these shows, the trees and the stream passing through the village are really beautiful. Spend some time in a pavilion by the stream and relax. Note that you should spend at least 3-4 hours to see everything around. After paying 15000 Wons to enter, and probably coming from a long way (it takes 70 minutes from Seoul to Suwon and 25 minutes from Suwon to the KFV) don't go back without seeing everyrthing :)"
an immersion on Korean history and culture,"The Korean Folk Village is quite huge, we haven't strolled the entire place during our four-hour visit because we enjoyed watching the shows (equestrian, farmers dance, traditional wedding, old man on the rope). We have seen the different kinds of houses that would tell one's position in the society. There is an area near the market where many Korean dramas where filmed, if you're a KDrama fanatic, you shouldn't miss it. They also have a ""foodcourt"" and souvenir shops. Getting to and from the village is not a problem because there's a free shuttle bus beside the Suwon Station Plaza. You need to go to the Tourist Information Center first to get a shuttle bus ticket (roundtrip). Upon reaching reaching KFV that's where you'll pay for the entrance fee. We printed a discount coupon from Visit Korea website and paid only 10,000KRW for the entrance fee."
Interesting place out of the ordinary,An intersting place. I felt as we were stepping back in time of the Kingdom era. Nice sceneries with old type houses. Will be more interesting had we went a few weeks later when the first falling leaves touch the ground.Very affordable entry ticket but not so much for the food. The foodcourt design was a little out of place. Some food are more pricey than in the city.
A wonderful day of Korean culture and history!,"I visited the Korean Folk Village with a friend in September 2014. This is a fantastic place to experience traditional Korean culture, history, art and food. The performances are absolutely wonderful! The food was reasonably priced and delicious. The only problem I had was that there were no comfortable seats to sit on for the performances - just low, awkward wooden benches, and it was almost impossible to even nab one of those. I have a hip problem, so this was a big problem for me. However, it was still a wonderful experience, and I would highly recommend the Korean Folk Village to anyone visiting South Korea."
I loved seeing the history.,"It was great seeing the neat historical things there. I liked seeing the shows too. I didn't get to see much because we only had a couple hours. I recommend going for at least four hours, maybe more."
Traditional Korean with touch of modern facilities,"love the environment here...the natural landscapes, the staf wearing hanbok and the peaceful feeling when i sat alone just enjoying time there.."
Authentic Experience...,"This place makes history exciting, insightful and wishful... Half day is not enough to see the historical places inside this village.There are also people showing how the past KR life is lived. There are dances and programs inside so make sure to have time to see it.I have been a fan of KR dramas and now it's clear why they film their historical dramas here.. Ancient house has been preserved and the wonderful bridges/surroundings is inspiring for long walks"
fun to visit,"if you are a lover of historical places, be here. You will get to know much of korean traditions and ancient living and it is so interesting."
Traditional Cultural Theme Park,"Do not miss this place, it is not only we can experience the Korean traditional culture, there are performances like delightful farmer's music and dance, thrilling acrobatics and traditional wedding ceremony; the filming locations for the famous Korean dramas; museum; theme park; beautiful gardens; and the place I like best is the bazaar. There is a workshop street, a shopping mall and the most happening Korean Food Court selling local foods. At the Food Court, young and old, families, some in their traditional costumes gathered around their traditional dining tables with their traditional foods.It is worth spending a whole day here, we promised ourselves we will visit this place again the next time we come to Seoul.Special reminder: do not forget to have your camera fully charged!"
A must see!,"My husband and I were here on August 7,2014 as one of the last stops during our 2 week tour of South Korea. We had a great time.The village is set up very nicely. The wedding and Farmer's band demos were our favorites. He was picked for a demonstration put on by the Farmer's band. I unfortunately do not have any pictures of this due to a camera malfunction. If at all possible that someone was there that morning during the first show and took pictures of a tall man with a goatee wearing a green shirt and hat that was pulled from the crowd to act with the band, please send me any pictures. I would *greatly* appreciate it. (sgeisinger1030@gmail.com)This was a once in a lifetime opportunity for us and I have no record of it. :( thank you!"
A Nice Day Trip from Seoul,"I took the subway line 1 from Seoul. Make sure you take a train headed to Sinchang. Get off at Suwon Station and take bus 37 to KFV. There is a free shuttle a few times a day but it was not the right timing for my arrival and departure. Admission is 15,000 won. It is a good way to see the houses of various kinds of families in different parts of Korea. The workers were dressed in the appropriate hanbok for their jobs. There are several performances twice daily including a traditional Korean wedding ceremony. Lots of food options but all Korean. I did not visit the amusement part of the village but there is an extra cost to be able to take part in the rides and activities. It rained throughout my visit but overall it was a nice experience to learn more about Korean Life in the past."
