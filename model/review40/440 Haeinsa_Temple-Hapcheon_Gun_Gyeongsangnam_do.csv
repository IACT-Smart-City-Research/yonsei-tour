Stunning location,"We visited on a Saturday from Daegu using public transport and having read up in advance thought the buses would be very busy. We wer pleasantly surprised how easy the trip from Daegu was although at the time we left the temple it was getting very crowded. We left from the bus station at around 10:00 *cant remember the exact time and the bus was nothing like full. we had to pay for the tickets in won as no cards were accepted (not sure if this was aglitch or usual) again had to pay for the return journey from the temple back to Daegu in cash. Tickets back were bought in the shop near where the bus terminates not at the little kiosk near the start of the walkway up to the temple. Kioask was unmanned. The bus teminus is by shops/cafes about 5 minutes walk further up the roadBy getting to the temple early although not having it to ourselves by any means.meant there were fewer toursits. Its a short up hill walk to the temple, through woods on a made up pathway so its not too hard. We spent about an hour wandering around, listing to the chanting and the drums and bells. Very relaxing place. You really cannot see the wooden printing blocks however we kindof knew this before we came. As we departed so many people started to arrive, they were quite noisy and the sheer numbers did spoil the tranquility of the temple. Its worth going to but get there early."
A UNESCO World Heritage Site,"The Haeinsa Temple is home to the Tripitaka Koreana Woodblocks - the most complete collection of Buddhists texts on 81,350 woodblocks with over 52 million characters."
Worth of your time,I visited Haeinsa from Seoul and I still think it was well worth the effort. The area and the temple itself are very beautiful and it is rather easy to get there. There's also good trails for hiking nearby.
Good visit worth the effort,"This is an easy day trip from Daegu if you don't want to do a temple stay. First go to the tourist info and get the time schedule for the bus. They are very helpful. From the subway stop, you go back around the elevator to the bus terminal. The cost 1 way was 8,100 won. They didn't take CC. The trip is easy, you will need an additional 3,000 won for the national Park ticket. When you get to the gate of the park, someone will check tickets and you can buy one. Then the first stop after this is the temple stop. You will need to give your ticket to the driver as you exit the bus. I didn't go to Haeinsa. Before leaving the stop, check the return times. There are some stores in the way up and a Cafe part way up as well. They wooden books are at the back of the temple. Worth the hike up. Just before the bus comes, a woman came out and I purchased a return ticket, again cash. "
Visit the temple and tripikata,Beautiful temple up in the mountains. The temple is exeptional. The Tripicata is recognised as UNESCO world heritage.
A wonderful place ,A temple with 1200 years history is part of the World Heritage with his storage hall of the Tripitaka Koreana. It’s a shame the 80.000 wood blocks cannot be accessed from close distance.
Haeinsa Temple UNESCO Site,It is a UNESCO Heritage site. I stayed there through temple stay in first week of May 2016. There was a tea with monk session. Meals are free but you are expected to donate something on the drop box. The view around the temple is breathtaking and time moves slowly there. The silence at night - I loved it! It is the head temple of Seon Buddhism. The receptionist lady speaks English and there was another motherly old lady doing temple stay who helped me a lot.
Haeinsa temple stay - a highlight of our Korean trip,"We managed to see all 3 jewels of temples in South Korea - Tongdosa near Busan that represents the Buddha because it houses the Buddha's sariras; Haeinsa near Daegu that represents the dharma because it houses the 80,000 wooden blocks of Tripitaka Koreana; and Songgwangsa near Gwangju that represents the Sanga because it's trained many famous monks. We also did a weekend temple stay program in Haeinsa. We chose it only because its schedule matched our itinerary well. However, now I must say it's an excellent choice because Haeinsa turned out to be my favorite among the 3 jewels. Just like many other temples in Korea, Haeinsa is located in a mountainous area - Gayasan to be specific. The temple ground isn't very large but the layout aligns with the natural environment very well so it has a very pleasant vibe. Most the buildings are well decorated but not overly shining. The real gem are no doubt the 4 modesty one level long buildings at the upper part of the temple ground that house the 80,000+ Tripitaka Koreana - the thousands years old wooden printing blocks of Buddhist sutras. Even though we could only glimpse between the wooden bars of the building walls, I still felt so precious knowing that I was so close to these invaluable treasures.The group of the people took part in the temple stay program was larger than I expected. Also a little surprisingly, probably two third of the 40+ people were local Koreans. Our host monk only speaks Korean but an English speaking staff was helping with translation. Although I got an overall understanding of what's going on, I could also tell what the English speaking staff said was lot less than what the monk had said. Nonetheless, it was an enjoyable experience overall. The drum ceremony at the evening and dawn was wonderful, the practice of prostration (full bow) was great moving meditation; sitting meditation was a bit short but probably suited most foreigners; the most amazing part was chanting - we had absolutely no clue what was chanted but because many fellow Korean participants actually know the chant so when everyone chanted together with the monks it's very powerful. The 1.5 hour guided temple tour was good as well. We heard many interesting stories and noticed some things we won't be able to notice if we walked around by ourselves. After the program finished in the following morning, we set out to hike Gayasan just behind Haeinsa. But after about 1.5 hours when we managed to hike up to the stone craved standing buddha statute, it seems the trail has disappeared into the bush. We tried a little further beyond the ""no trail"" sign but found that the trail became very steep, not well trodden and just didn't feel right. Reluctantly we decided to turn around and go back down to the temple. We were a little disappointed that we were unable to reach the summit of Gayasan, but the trek to the standing buddha is not bad. in fact when we arrived the standing buddha a group of devotees were chanting there, the atmosphere was so special."
Haeinsa Temple Stay,"We did a one night temple stay at Haeinsa and were utterly disappointed. It was a commercial exercise where several of us were accommodated in tiny ensuite rooms. We were herded around like school children in single file to the temple where we witnessed some prayers and chanting and the temple stay monk spoke in Korean while the interpreter was, sadly, very poor in translating that she generally said one sentence to every paragraph he spoke. It was a meaningless exercise. And when it rained, the tour of the premises was cancelled. The buildings themselves are stunning. Hundreds of tourists descend by the busloads to see the place. Its a victim of its own success.For us, unfortunately, there was no spiritual vibe to the place."
Very disappointed by the templestay,"I attended the regular week-end templestay program, I expected much better from the templestay :The monk was not speaking English. A translator was trying to translate but the monk kept interrupting her, showing no form of respect !The food was exactly the same for dinner and breakfast, not good, when monks had better dishes.Rain was expected for the second day but the temple tour was not anticipated, therefore the second day program was limited to prostrations and silence.No activity unlike said on the internet (no lantern making or religious object).Disappointed..."
Very nice tempel,"It is easy to get by bus here. You have every 40 minutes a bus.The bus station at Haeinsa is exactly 1.2km away from the temple and is a easy 15 minutes walk. The bus station is on the main street (Gayasan road), where the walking path towards the temple begins. The bus station is near the sales stalls for souvenirs and food and the picknick-area.The GPS-coordinates for the station are: 35°47'31.7""N 128°05'36.8""EThe bus ticket can be purchased at the bus station Haeinsa (it has a small booth beside the bus stop sign - otherwise also in the bus)"
Don't miss this place...,"I took the bus from Busan to get here in Gayasan National Park. It took a while but it was a very pleasant journey. I took the Bus to Goryeong, from the Sasang Intercity Bus Station; on the Green line. Once in Goryeong bus station I took the direct bus to Haeinsa Temple. The last stop. The village is lovely...surrounded by mountains and woods. I decided to stay 3 nights and I could have stayed more to be honest. It's a perfect place to relax. Also great food, and a couple of nice Cafes. The Sunjae Cafe', right in your way to the temple, is perfect for a coffee break and they sell a lot of local products. I hope you find this review useful. "
Very important historic site,The place is in the national park and is part of Unesco world heritage. It is well preserved and maintained. The place stores an important part of Korean history - wooden printing tablets.
A Piece of Cultural History,"This is a cultural and historic site as it houses the Buddhist sacred texts, the Tripitaka Koreana. It is a peaceful and beautiful setting which is very well maintained."
Amazing temple,"To here, takes for 1 and half hours by bus.And bus stop to temple takes for couple of minutes by walk.You can see wonderful nature during walk to temple.Temple is large so worth visiting if you come to Daegu."
Stunning temple,"It is worth the effort to get here. (I took an 80 minute bus ride from Daegu.) It is beautiful, friendly and serene. I spent more time here than I planned because it was so peaceful. Be sure and have tea or a treat at the temple."
Templestay and World Heritage,"I went here because of its World Heritage status. The temple can be reached from Seoul through the nearest big city, Daegu. To complete my experience there, I did templestay as well. The booking at templestay website was easy but there was not any confirmation from the temple so it was a bit confusing at the beginning.The location of the temple itself is very high inside Gayasan National Park. The walk to the temple is very inclined, so take taxi if you have the budget or avoid carrying big luggages. Another thing, you must arrive at the temple before 5pm to get the templestay dinner. Otherwise, you might miss the dinner. Surprisingly, the temple has super quick wifi!! Try to connect to its wifi while you are there!The view inside the temple is nice, especially in the morning before all the tourists flock in. One big disapppointment though, I could not see the precious Tripitaka Koreana up close. I just saw grilled buildings with some wooden things inside which is said to be the Tripitaka Koreana."
Mesmerisingly beautiful gem ,One of the most beautiful zen monasteriesI have ever visited.The monastery is hidden away in the foggy mountainous backdrop. It is about 1.2 km away from the newest bus station.You will have to go all the way to the top of the temple to see the ancient wooden block carvings of the Tripitaka. A must to see if you are nearby the Daegu area!!!!
Typical temple,"I was let down by the security lines at the Tripitaka halls. I can only see some dark block of woods through the holes of the wooden wall. It was utterly a let down. With little information displayed, it's perhaps not as impressive as it seemed.At the time of my visit, the temple grounds were somewhat closed. Monks were busily chanting at the main hall. Everything seemed off limits.The museum is closed on Monday. "
Wonderful Buddhist Temple,"We were here as a group for an overnight temple stay.The location is beautiful as is the temple and the gardens. Temple stay rules are fairly strict. No smoking, no alcohol and the sexes are segregated at night (even married couples).Food is basic and vegetarian. You eat what the monks eat but you can bring in your own snacks. Beware that there are no food outlets nearby.Lights out at 9 pm and you sleep on thin mattresses on the floor.The temple houses a unique copy of the ""Tripitaka"", a Buddhist text, carved on to wooden plates. These are not accessible to the public but may be glimpsed through the ventilation slats of the ancient building which houses them.You can opt out of some activities but it is worth getting up at 3 am to watch the beating of the massive temple drum and take part in the chanting and meditation."
Unique Buddhist library,"We reached the Haeinsa temple by bus from Daegu (Seobu bus terminal, 1-1.5h). The bus stops at the bottom of a small hill from which the temple is sign posted. We found it easily. To get back, the bus stops across the street and hours are posted. Five minutes before the bus arrives a clerk opens the ticket booth.The temple is absolutely beautiful and a must see, even if just for its historical and cultural significance. We were a little disappointed that the library is completely off limits. Understandable considering the importance and fragility of the library but we had hoped for a small section to be open for the public (hence the 4 instead of 5 stars). One of the tablets is on display outside.The surroundings of the temple are stunning. We wished we had more time to walk around the nature park.Well worth the trip!"
Nice experience,"What a place. Tranquilizing, peaceful place to rest your soul.We joined the free and easy package. Reach there at 430pm with a rented car. Its a bit hard to find but we bum into a local that needed a ride and direct us there. The check-in was simple and easy. A guy with good English hand us our bed sheet, blanket and pillow cover and bring us to the room and explain the schedule and location of activities then you are free. Me and my boyfriend was allow to stay in the same room. (Surprise!!) Room. Its a square room with nothing but table fan on the wooden floor, and a clean toilet. Bring your own toiletries and towel, they gave you nothing. The monk playing the drum was fascinating and worth a view. The food was simple and okay. Lights off at 9pm and woke up at 3am for a morning pray. The sky was amazing at 3am!!!!All activity are optional to join since we book the free and easy but is worth a try to experience. "
Wonderful place: difficult access by public transport,"The temple, with its 80 thousand woodcut plates is a unique temple. Set in a pretty wood on a step climb, the temple complex takes forty to fifty minutes to view completely.Two issues: Don't expect to see the plates, they are not accessible.Access is difficult with public transport, a car is a much better option.Cost of entry was W 30 000 pp and W 40 000 for the car. The small museum, 500 metres below, is extra."
농산정Nongsan Waterfall and rock calligraphy.,"If you drive dont miss 농산정 the stunning waterfall and rock If you drive to Haeinsa Temple, dont miss this beautiful waterfall and historical stone carvings calligraphy near at the ticket counter. You can park your car no the right ride and walk opposite and cross the bridge.好美的瀑布, 水流很急。古时代的书法"
Amazing mountainside and temple,"Amazing hike to the temple on the mountainside. I saw flowing rivers, wild boars, beautiful trees, and green, green everywhere as far as you can see. Then I got to the temple itself.It was amazing and although they closed off the main attraction, the wooden blocks were amazing. We lamented the fact that we couldn't get close to the blocks to the gift shop cashier and she immediately radioed up to the temple and we were let in the back area for a few minutes. That was an amazing experience and overall was my favorite place in all of South Korea."
Beautiful temple ,"The Haeinsa temple is home to set of 80,000 wood blocks that are engraved with the Tripitaka Koreana. They were created in the 13th century and are the largest set of wood blocking cravings in the world. "
Temple complex on mountainside,"It is a pleasant uphill walk (about 3/4 mile) from the bus stop to the Temple gate. There is a museum a short way up the walkway. You walk on a designated path, not on rough terrain.There are also bathrooms and a café on the way up. If you don't want to walk, you can drive to the gate.The temple grounds include several buildings, a courtyard labyrinth, tea shop, and gift shop. We were a little disappointed in the commercialization of some of the buildings (i.e. for a souvenir shop).We, unfortunately, were not there during the bell-ringing and meditation, which we are told is a neat experience. They do have an overnight templestay program available.The lower part of the walkway up to the temple is lined with vendors selling dried fruits, snacks, and souvenirs.The bus from Daegu to Haiensa is about 70 minutes and cost about $12."
Great temple visit with lots of activities going on,"The temple is a bit of a walk up the hill and once there its a compact locationLots going on, gift shop, lanterns with good wishes for sale, coffee and book shop and a few places to snack. However, your main reason is not gourmet - temple itself. Nice golden buddhas and places to pray over a few floors. The famous Tripitaka, Koreans proof that they where ahead of Gutenberg (not true, as Gutenberg invented the movable letter) can be seen in a storage from distance and a few in original in a vitrine. Worthwhile."
Haeinsa is great temple. ,"It is one of SAM BO Temples. Great. It is Beob Bo Sa Chal(Temple of bible). Many people think it is far from daugu, but actually it is shorter that the time between Seoul and Namiseon. In other word it will take one hour from central Daegu to Haeinsa temple. Goryeo Tripitaka (81,258 ""Press"") is here you can see through bars only. :) "
Unique monastery and temple ,"Ancient monastery and temple from the 9th century. A must visit in any trip to Korea. Located on a mountain in a national park with one main temple, but 8 or 9 smaller temples within 1 km distance. Highly recommended (!)"
Templestay for those seeking peace and the outdoors,"For an intense but valuable introduction to the actual practice of Korean Buddhism stay in floor heated same sex ensuites and slip into a hermit 's routine. Options of freestyle stay give you space and time to walk around the stunning national park the temple is in. The indian reverb is strong as the park is named after Gaya. The most unmissable is the tripitaka koreana woodblocks, the chanting monks and the temple food. Their rules are strict so those who only seek pleasures may avoid. Else, a fulfilling experience."
Watch a monk bang a drum...enough said,"I read plenty about Haeinsa and felt compelled to go. Haeinsa is simply a must not miss when in Korea. The temple is not only filled with rich history, but it's nestled in a lush landscape (particularly in the fall) and the monks are very hospitable. From chanting in the temple to hiking, Haeinsa is a great place to get away from it all. Getting there: It's quite easy to reach Haeinsa from Daegu. Get to Seobu Bus Terminal and there is a bus that heads to Haeinsa. At the time of this writing, a one-way ticket cost 7200 won. It's about a 1.5 hour ride and one can see Korean countryside. Once the bus gets there, you'll have to walk about 15-20 minutes to get to the actual temple. The roads are paved and it's a pleasant walk. In addition, you'll see vendors selling food and wares. At the temple: There is no cost to enter/see the temple, but donations are always recommend. If you have the time, I HIGHLY recommend a temple stay. For 50000 won (per person), you can spend the night, get a peek into everyday life of a monk, chant in the temple, eat in the same area as the monks. Word of caution: the accommodations are simple and you do sleep on the floor (though you're provided blankets and the floor is heated). Bathroom/shower is ensuite. Be sure to follow the rules you are provided, ie, eating in the correct area of the dining hall. The next day, I was fortunate enough to help the monks prepare kimchi! If you love to hike, Haeinsa is full of trails that lead to other smaller temples. If you're there in the fall, take in the rich colors of the foliage...it's quite a site. Be sure to chant w/ the monks in the main temple...even if you don't chant, it's fascinating to observe. I also recommend watching the monks bang the gong during the evening (about 6 pm). There is a convenience store up the hill that will sell tickets back to Daegu. Again, very easy to get to and from.If you're planning yr Korean itinerary, Haeinsa is not to be missed."
"Interesting Buddhist Temple, Triptaka and a UNESCO World Heritage Site .","This famous temple is a must if you are in the Gayasan National Park area. As the matter of fact the hiking trails connect the temple with the local mountain peaks. We came via rental car and had to pay a fee at the Park gate. After parking near the temple complex the rest of the exploration is on foot. For a tired traveler there is a little food stand at the entrance to the temple. We enjoyed hot chocolate and sweet purple potato drink. The temple was both festive and peaceful at the same time. We explored all the allowed areas. We also saw the building housing the Tripitaka Koreana, the most complete collection of Buddhist texts in existence. Haeinesa is on of the Three Jewel Temples of Korea and try not to miss it."
Wonderful temple stay,"I participated in the relaxed temple stay program on Oct and it was a great experience. I was the only non Korean speaker among the group on that day of stay. I was given a brief but informative tour of the temple in English and even during the chat with a senior monk, the staff was there to offer translation throughout the session. Very much appreciated for that. The drums session at morning and evening service were superb too. I really enjoyed this unique experience and would consider joining temple stay again. "
U MUST COME,"Quite place, beautiful view. When I went to the temple, the local girl invited me to watch the activity: Monks beat drums. It's the experence I never tried before, deeply impressed. And also the temple has 80000+ buddhist woodblocks. "
UNESCO Memory of the World,"This millenary old temple is a national treasure and is a symbol of Korean Buddhism. It is a Buddhist holy place located on high ground of 400 meters above sea level at Gaya Mountain. The most significant Buddhist sacred texts, the Tripitaka Koreana, are housed here. The grounds are beautiful and serene and the buildings are masterfully preserved. Do not miss this site!"
Unmissable; an easy day trip from Daegu,"One of Korea's primary temples, the complex is home to the Tripitaka Koreana, one of the world’s most significant Buddhist sacred texts, carved into 80000 woodblocks. The fact that they are locked away and visitors can't see them close-to did not detract from the magic of our visit.We caught the bus from Daegu’s Seobu (West) intercity bus terminal, reached from the city centre on the subway's red line.The walk to the temple from the bus stop took us just over half an hour. The mountain location enhanced our experience. I'm not sure if there are services everyday, but on the Thursday we visited the sound of chanting, bells and drums was enchanting."
Temple stay at Heinsa,"We love everything that have UNESCO words in it and Heinsa is one of them. We choose heinsa for our temple stay program since the temple house Tripikata Koreana and we are glad that we had a glimpse of it. The temple complex is huge, quite and amazingly beautiful. Living like a monk for a night, praying at 3.30 am in the morning, listening to chanting and participate in prayer give us an amazing cultural experienced. located at gayasan national park, we regreted that we didnt have much time to explore the surrounding area. For those who plan to visit heinsa, its best to combine gayasan national park together and explore its history and tranquility side by side. Highly recommended"
Take your time and relax,"Haeinsa Temple is in a large mountain park that has some very nice natural things to see. I suggest to do a temple stay here so you can soak up the area. I believe it is less than $50 a person ( food included ) ( for a foreigner ) and you can stay the night, learn a lot, and get a chance to explore the area...which you need several hours to do . The steps to the temple and wooden block area are cool because you keep going up and up and up and finally behind the temple you reach the place where they store the wooden blocks. Cool things to see and nice places to sit and reflect. My only disappointment is that I missed seeing the wooden blocks because they only open the doors to that building once every 3 years or so. Double check that before you go"
"The home of the "" Tripitaka Koreana"" Haeinsa","Here is some background I found of this place. ""Haeinsa is one of the Three Jewel Temples of Korea, and represents Dharma or the Buddha’s teachings. It is the home of home of the Tripitaka Koreana, the whole of the Buddhist Scriptures carved onto 81,350 wooden printing blocks, which it has housed since 1398.""Tripotaka was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1995.  The place is filled with Korean history. There is a long way from the parking space to iljumoon. Sungbo museum can be seen on the way there, so don't forget to stop by at this place as well. The temples are of old Korean traditional buildings. Those who love Korean history or buddhism would definitely be worth it to travel here."
Awe inspiring experience,"Words fail me when describing how humbling one feels when immersed in the immortality of this temple and the nearly incomprehensible human effort involved on creating and preserving the Tripitaka Koreana. The collection of over 80,000 printing wood blocks could be called a 1,000 year old Buddhist encyclopedia that weighs 280 tons and when placed in a line, its total length is about 60 km."
So pleased to have visited!,"Some say this is the most famous, others say it is one of the three most famous temples in Korea. It is located an hour and 20 minutes by bus from Korea's third largest city Daegu, in the beautiful Kaya Mountains. As the whole area is a national park, from the entrance of the park up to the village where all the inns are, the road goes along a river, and the scenery in autumn must be breathtaking. ( We just missed the foliage and the leaves had all fallen but it was still beautiful.) The village to the Haeinsa Temple is a 15 minute walk uphill. We had come with the intention of staying overnight in the village so we were able to watch the 5:50 p.m. drum (taiko) ritual performed by the monks, and sit in the 6:20 ish p.m. Chanting in the main temple (Daejeokgwangjeon). Haeinsa's storage hall of the Tripitaka Koreana (80,000 wood blocks ) is designated a National Treasure by UNESCO. Our friend who took us there had previously done a temple stay at Haeinsa which she enjoyed tremendously. Be sure to make the extra effort to also see the Paengnyon Am Temple which is located 20 or 30 minutes on foot further up the mountain from the Haeinsa. It was the most magical and beautiful temple any one of us had EVER seen or visited. We were lucky in that the owner of our lodge had given us a ride up there as the road uphill is very steep, but we would do it on foot again if we have to. This Paengnyon Am temple being perched so high up on the mountain, towering serenely with the backdrop of even taller cliffs make it so so very special. Makes you speechless!"
해인사 장경판전,"Now we are living in modern times and we have many great technologies. Even though we have them, we can't reach Korean ancestor's wisdom. Today, we are going to introduce Haeinsa Temple 장경판전 that has the most excellent and scientific heritage in Korea that has history of 5000 years.First, we are going to tell you about origin of 팔만대장경. In buddha's teaching, called 84000buddhist writings. 8 has a meaning of 'lot'. The reason of making 팔만대장경 is to drive away 몽골 soldiers with buddhist power. 팔만대장경 has been kept in 장경판전. More than 80000 characters have the same size and it is famous that the characters don't have any wrong words. It is believed that the writers were trained to have a perfectly same hand writing for one year before they start to write it.It is surprise that there are only 158 wrong letters of all and it is discovered today. A typing error rate of 팔만대장경 is 0.0003%. In other words, when you write 1645sheets of manuscripts, can you never made any error words? According to the tradition, people who wrote it made a deep bow when they wrote each letter.장경판전 is recognized of its greatness because it has a numerous 장경판 in it and the marvelous scientific technologies that preserve 팔만대장경 until today. In front of 장경판전, it has two above and below windows. Above window is bigger than below window. Behind of 장경판전, it has two above and below windows, too. and below window is bigger than above window. To make these windows this way, dry wind blows in front window and it circulates in 장경판전, and then it gets out back window. So it is possible to control the humidity better than any other modern technologies.Also, the inside of the 판전's floor consists of charcoal, lime powder , salt, sand, so that we can control the amount of moisture. In order to keep 장경판전 not curved, they used 마구리 in finishing process. Taking everything into account, it shows Korean ancestor's wisdom, too.  Korean cherish heritage, 장경판전 is acknowledged for its scientific technology, so it was listed on world heritage in 1995 also. Lastly, as we studied on 장경판전, we realized that world cultural heritages like 장경판전 contribute to human history. So, we should not acknowledge only Korean magnificent heritage, but should have interest in and take care of the world's heritage.오늘날 우리는 정보화 시대를 이루었고 뛰어난 기술을 이용해 다양한 제품들을 만들고 있다. 하지만 뛰어난 기술을 갖춘 현대에도 따라갈 수 없는 과거의 유산이 있다. 바로 해인사 팔만대장경이다. 5000만년의 긴 우리나라 역사 중 가장 우수하고 과학적인 문화유산을 꼽자면 해인사 팔만대장경일 것이다. 우선, 팔만대장경의 이름유래에 대해서 알아보면, 불교에서 부처의 가르침을 8만 4000법문이라고 하는데, 불교에서 8만은 많다는 뜻을 가진 숫자이다. 팔만대장경의 이름도 여기서 유래되었다. 해인사 대장경의 경판수도 8만 1258장이니 팔만대장경이라는 말이 딱 맞다고 할 수 있다. 팔만대장경은 8만장에 달하는 서체가 모두 일정하며, 오탈자가 없는 것으로 유명하다. 서체가 일정한 것은 글씨를 담당한 사람들의 글씨체를 모두 일정한 모양으로 만들기 위해 거의 1년 동안 훈련을 했기 때문이라고 알려져 있다. 놀라운 점은 발견된 오탈자가 5200여 만자 중 단 158자, 그것도 현대에 와서 겨우 찾아냈다는 것이다. 팔만대장경의 오타율은 0.0003%이고, 알기 쉽게 설명하자면, 당신이 200자 원고지 1645장 분량의 글을 쓰고 있는데, 그 안에 있는 오탈자를 한 글자 이내로 만드는 것이 가능하겠는가? 전설에 따르면 장경판전을 만든 사람들은 한 글자를 새길 때마다 한 번씩 절을 했다고 한다.팔만대장경이 세계적으로 그 우수성을 인정받는 이유는 어마어마한 숫자 뿐 만 아니라 뛰어난 과학기술까지 갖추고 있었기 때문이다.장경판전의 앞쪽은 상하로 2개의 창문이 있는데 위쪽의 문은 작고 아래쪽은 크다. 장경판전 뒤쪽에도 상하의 창문이 있으며 앞쪽과는 반대로 위쪽 창문이 크고 아래쪽은 작게 만들었다. 이러한 과학적인 원리로 건조한 바람이 앞쪽으로 들어와 장경판전 내부에서 순환한 후 뒤쪽의 창문으로 빠져 장경판전 내부의 습기를 그 어떤 현대의 첨단기술보다 뛰어나게 조절할 수 있었다. 또한 판전 내부의 흙바닥에는 숯, 횟가루, 소금을 모래와 함께 차례로 깔아서 습기를 조절할 수 있도록 만들었고, 경판이 휘지 않게 마구리를 마무리 한 것 또한 우리 조상님들의 과학지식이 위대함을 알 수 있다. 이렇듯 장경판전은 뛰어난 과학성과 기술을 인정받아 1995년 세계문화유산으로 인정받았고, 또한 대한민국의 소중한 문화유산이다. 마지막으로 우리는 장경판전을 연구하면서 장경판전과 같은 세계문화유산이 인류의 역사에 기여한다는 것을 깨닫게 되었고 이를 통해 우리는 한국문화재의 중요성만을 인정할 것이 아니라 세계의 문화유산에 관심을 갖고 보살펴야 한다는 것을 느꼈다."
beautiful and peaceful place.,"I arrived at haeinsa temple at second morning bus from daegu . I was the only person climbing the hill up to the temple. it was so fresh and peaceful, the only sound were the water flowing on the river and the birds singing. on the bus coming here I was wondering why the monks built a temple so far away from anywhere and isolated up the hills. I understood the reason when arriving here, the nature is different such as the trees are taller and larger , the river is flowing with very clear water from the mountain and full with rocks ,the place is full with green healthy bushes and shrubs . it is beautiful ,serene and peaceful fitted to the monk monasticism life . I was lucky that when I was there I saw the monks doing the drum ceremony and chanting. you can avoid climbing all the very steep stairs by just walking on the side of the temples up to the highest temple where they keep the tripitaka writings."
Historic and beautiful,"This is probably our favorite Korean temple and we visit every couple of years. Like many, it's in a forested mountain area that is superbly beautiful, especially in autumn. The high point historically is the wood block tripitaka, but everything here evokes beauty and serenity. One can easily spend the better part of a day here. They offer a simple vegetarian meal from time to time, asking only that those who are able to make a small contribution to the temple do so. Of course, it can be crowded on holidays. Tip to fellow non-Buddhists: Don't let a priest see you stomping on a spider. I did and got a prolonged stinkeye from him. Oh, well. All in all, this is one of the most historic and beautiful temples in the country."
Ancient Temple set in a beautiful National Park that offers unique temple stay experience,"Haeinsa Temple Stay was one of the highlights of my trip to Korea. I came here because I was interested in the wooden print blocks of the Korean Tripitaka. As many have pointed out, the library is no longer open to visitors. Naturally, I was disappointed. But it is perfectly understandable as this is to preserve the precious monument. I think everyone should respect this. I was glad that there were a few wooden block on exhibit at one corner and you can buy the prints of some Buddhist scriptures printed from the original print blocks as souvenirs. (5000W for each print).But there is really more to Haeinsa then the Tripitaka Koreana. Haeinsa temple itself is a beautiful ancient temple. And there are many other temples nestled in the mountain areas around it. As the temple is right in the Gaya National Park, the scenery is really nice. I spent quite a bit of time wondering around, visiting the various temples, exploring the groves of towering pine trees. I made my way down to the river and spent quite some time sitting by the river. I chanced upon a bridge made out of a single log near the temple. There are also many interesting art installations around the temple.I signed out for the temple stay and spent a night in the temple. It was an interesting experience, which I will really recommend. The temple offer a full temple stay program during the weekends and a free and easy program during week days. For the free-and-easy program, you only need to join the evening prayers session. The morning 3am session is optional. I slept through the morning prayers. I really recommend the temple stay because that gives you more time to explore the temple and the area around it at a more leisurely pace. Besides, the prayer sessions were a very interesting experience. I paid a fee of 40,000W for temple stay. The room provided was clean but basic. Toiletries and towels are not provided, so you need to bring your own. The temple provided three meals (rice, a few dishes, and a soup). The food was slightly bland but it suited me well. I enjoyed the meal very much. Silence needs to be observed during meal time. Apparently if you there during lunch time, you can joined in the lunch too even if you didn't sign up for the temple stay. I saw many visitors did that during lunch time.There are hourly departures for Haeinsa from the Seobu Bus station in Daegu (just above the Seongdangmot metro station). The bus fare was 7100W. Haeinsa is the terminal station, so you don't have to worry about missing the station. But it is another 1 km uphill from the bus stop. You can leave your luggage in the lockers at the Seobu Bus station and just take along your essentials. If you have a trolley bag, go along the pave road and not the trekking trails as one part of the trail is unpaved. There are also taxis if you don't want to walk that 1 km."
Stunning surrounds and gorgeous art dotted around the temple gardens,"I took the bus to Haeinsa from Geochang's main bus terminal. The bus times (as at September 1 2014): 09:00, 14:20 and 19:20. I asked the conductor for the temple stop - and was very lucky to have a old man going to the temple accompany off of the bus and all the way to the temple. Its important to take cash for this trip - the bus will be stopped at the gate and you need to pay your 3000 won upfront. From the stop, walk along the street, past the vendors for about 300 meters, and then turn left into the parking lot. Pass through the parking lot and once you cross the bridge its an easy walk to the temple. The artworks along the way to the temple really are spectacular - and blend so well into the surroundings that they seem almost organic. The temple itself is comparable to Beomosa in Busan - ornate and well maintained. I was lucky to see the drumming ceremony by the monks - it was a weekday at around 11:00 am. The monks also directed me to have a free vegetarian lunch - which was quite delicious. The Tripitaka Koreana can be found at the very top of the temple complex - I was not able to actually enter the library as such, but I was able to take pictures of them from the outside. It was a great way to spend the morning! The return bus times to Geochang (as at September 1 2014): 07:00, 10:10 and 15:30.If you have some time after the temple, take a walk along the river, the path from just behind the bus stop is a really lovely easy walk. There are a few temples, small waterfalls and lovely rest stops along the way."
A great walk hit the museum ,It is a beautiful temple but a large part is off limits but the museum more than makes up for it and explains how the blocks were made and used. Also shows who the head monks were and their role. Try it $10 bucks US to get in the park.$2 bucks US to get into the museum also be ready to walk up a mountain were good shoes also steep stairs as well.... 
"Very good temple, but.","CY ( 2014.06.28 ) This temple was very good temple, but fell short of my expectation. I and my wife arrived parking area, and walking to temple about 20 minutes. The scenery was very good, in walking time. We expected to see the complete collection of Buddhist scriptures carved on over eighty thousand woodblocks, but there was closed. So we just look around Haeinsa temple. It was certain that this templ was good, but I was a little disappointed, I think. Enjoy temple with mountain scene.."

"the best temple in South Korea, worth the trip","This temple can be reached by bus from Daegu. The trip takes a little more than one hour, but it's definitely worth it. The trip takes you through a beautiful area, with mountains and forest. The area is very quiet, an excellent place if you want to get away from it all. It's a pity that the Tripitaka can't be seen, but still: don't miss it, it is one of the best places to visit in South Korea."
Rich history,"Located in the Gaya mountain, this temple visit is a nice scenic walk. And, if the walk isn't enough for you, the courtyard has a mediative labyrinth for you to walk through. Once at the temple, they have a lot of information regarding the Tripitaka Koreana, which was nice and educational. A lot of temples in Korea do not have much in regards to explanations, especially not in English, but this one had quite a few stands of info, explaining everything from the history of the place to how the wooden printing blocks were made. You can't actually go inside the hall that holds the wooden blocks anymore (apparently as of 2013) because the humidity control system can be distorted by just the simple act of entering. This is apparently especially true on very hot days, rainy days, etc. Many seemed disappointed, but the temple did place a couple of the blocks outside on display and a couple of pictures, which some tourists were using as backgrounds to pose in front of.Note that first and foremost, this is a temple. There are monks trying to go about their daily activities and out of all the temples we've been to, these monks seemed the most jaded (probably way too many tourists). This place also had the most regulated hours of visiting (most temples let you visit whenever). Anyways, it might not hurt to refrain from making loud noise, dressing inappropriately, bringing food, etc. Their website has the whole list if you're interested in the rules or if you need to check if the compound is even open. e.g. they are closed on Tuesday according to their website. http://www.80000.or.kr/eng/info/opening.htmlIn terms of getting there, drive. It's so much easier.All in all, a nice visit. It was cool to see the mountains in the background and walk about the large complex."
Spectacular temple in the mountain,"Also it is spectacular, it remains quite and full of serenity. Architecture very surprising on this location. The entire place is very authentic."
Spectacular architecture,"This is one of the impressive historic site in Korea. The travel is convenience, but need to take a little bit long time. I take the bus from Deagu Seobu Terminal which is next to the Seongdangmot Station of Daegu Subway.The buses is not so enough, I need to wait for more than 40 mins. The travel time is around one and half hour.The temple is huge and attractive. It should be the best representative work of Korean ancient architecture. The library also is amazing, but tourists couldn't go inside.I have joined the temple stay program. It is a unique activities for the tourists to experience the Buddhist meditation, and appreciate this world class cultural architecture.Temple stay for weekends is more expensive than weekdays (20000 won less). But the programs of weekends are much extensive. If anyone would like to stay there, I prefer the weekends one."
One of Korea's 'Must See' Buddhist Temples,"This one of the most beautiful and historic temples of Korea. While there is a rather touristy village about a kilometer from the entrance, the temple is kept in pristine condition on a pine-covered slope of Gaya Mountain. The location is renown for its combination of dark pines, rolling clouds and remarkable architecture. Though now kept thoroughly off limits to most visitors, the temple is a major historical and cultural landmark for its preservation of the Tripitaka Koreana, the whole of the Buddhist Scriptures carved onto 81,350 wooden printing blocks, which it has housed since 1398. The temple was founded in 802.Haein-sa or Haein Temple is one of the three great Seon or Zen temples of Korea. It remains as a primary training center for male monks. As such, the monks take their religious practices quite seriously and one gets the impression that they quietly tolerate rather than welcome visitors.The temple owns most of the land in the national park and within the Gaya mountain area. It is thereby one of the wealthiest temples in Korea. It serves as hub for several smaller Buddhist retreats or hermitages that dot the surrounding hills and mountains.To explore the temple and its surrounding nature, a good half day minimum is required upon arrival. Sturdy walking or hiking shoes are strongly suggested. Most people take the two-hour bus from Daegu City and spend the night at one of hotels that range from modest to fairly upscale. The temple has an excellent tea/coffee house located just outside of the main entrance into the sacred grounds that offers excellent beverages and a nice view into the valley below."
"Amazing once in a lifetime opportunity, dont miss it and try and stay overnight.","I did a one night stay at Haeinsa and it was the highlight of my trip to South Korea. The temple is set in a beautiful area with scenic surroundings and other beautiful temples within walking distance. The staff working at the temple are lovely and helpful. The accomodation is simple but clean, bathroom facilities are adequate but not sure if they are suitable for a long term stay. The shower in my dorm room was not working but I believe there are shared facilities within the temple grounds that you can use. There are rules that must be followed if you stay here, but if you do the freestyle program they are pretty basic such as having meals at stipulated times and attending ceremonies, plus you must be as quiet as possible if you stay at the temple, especially during meal times. The food is simple and vegetarian. Its not for everyone but its the experience of eating with the monks that makes it worthwhile. Bedding is thin mattress on floor and duvet, nothing luxurious, but comfortable enough for a nights stay. Make sure you take the time to visit surrounding temples and the grounds as its beautiful, peaceful and a wonderful location. The cafe at the entrance to the temple is slightly expensive but worth a visit, the friendly guy who runs it makes great honey bread and refreshing drinks. His english is excellent and he is good for a chat. Book through the temple stay website."
Lovely traditional temple stay experience,I booked via the temple stay website and was also able to reconfirm the booking direct with the temple.After checking in we were shown to our room. It was large with an ensuite shower wet room.There were lots of mattresses and duvets in the room so we could make our own beds.We did the free style stay as we were travelling around South Korea and couldn't work the scheduled temple program into our travel itinerary.With this free style stay we were able to have free time to walk around the temple grounds looking at the various buildings plus hiking to nearby hermitages.At the set time we went for our dinner that we ate in the same dining room with the monks. The food was vegetarian and delicious.After the meal we watched a drum ceremony plus the monks praying inside a temple. After this we and the other visitors spent some time with a monk talking which was enjoyable.The next morning we had a delicious breakfast before leaving.The temple setting was peaceful in a beautiful location. If we visit South Korea we would stay here again but for the scheduled temple stay.
Full of Korean history,"Haeinsa is another of Korea's gem temples. It would be particularly interesting for those interested in Korea's history. It houses a printing press that is hundreds of years older than the Gutenburg press and is loaded with the history of printing in Asia. The tripitikana (ancient buddhist scripture? text) resides in the museum. It's an extremely old document and it's under glass, but I would recommend Haeinsa for those interested in such things. "
Home of the Tripitaka Koreana (library of Buddhist texts),"It was a temple that was a little different than the others (but they are all pretty similar in Korea, right?) The library is impressive, though it was disappointing that you couldn't go inside or take any pictures. The gentlemen there working were very friendly and helpful. There are several sets of stairs you walk up, and can get a decent view of the mountains. We were there in winter so it was cold, snowy (beautiful!) but we couldn't explore as much as we wanted. Also I would shoot to get out there by 11, we arrived close to 2pm and almost got stuck out there. "
One of Korea's Most Historic Temples,"As far as temples go, Haeinsa is not as impressive as some in Korea. However, the truly exceptional quality of Haeinsa is the 81,000 woodblocks housed in specially designed 15th century buildings. These priceless treasures are preserved in wooden buildings that are centuries old. The Tripitaka Koreana is the most complete Buddhist canon that exists anywhere. There are no known errors to the text and the woodblocks were made in the 13th century during the Goryeo dynasty.To preserve the woodblocks however, visitors can only look through a viewing area. This is logical, yet some visitors might be dissapointed. The remaining areas of Haeinsa temple as a whole are interesting, but not exceptional. The buildings housing the woodblocks (Janggyeong Panjeon) in the rear of the temple is very old (15th century), the rest of the temple is largely from the 19th century. The 3 story stone pagoda (Silla dynasty) is over 1,000 years old. This style of pagoda is very typical to the late Silla era, and therefore relatively common. For nature lovers, Haeinsa is located on the fringe of Gayasan National Park."
