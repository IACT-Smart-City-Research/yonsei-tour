"Fun, but the last half is a good workout","My family and I spent several days in Yeosu and our pension was only 20 meters from the rail bike. Naturally, we added the rail bike to our list of things-to-do. The view from the rail bike is spectacular and the first have of the ride is fairly easy. The ocean views give way to a large tunnel that has colorful lighting to guide your path. The return is a little more daunting as you must travel slightly uphill. Make sure you have a few healthy people in your party to really pedal on the last half of the ride. Overall, an enjoyable addition to our trip."
Railbike = Great,"I always recommend doing railbike in Korea. This one is no exception. It’s a 30 minute ride: down hill though a tunnel, then a switch and back uphill to the start. Great views of the ocean to one side!"
A fun time,"Four of us went on the Ocean Rail Bike. It was easy to pedal. The view was great. Although the day was hot, the breeze kept us cool. The staff fine."
Good!,"I enjoyed cool sea wind riding it by the sea. The view was good. It's not hard to paddle it. Though it's too short taking about 20-30 minutes, it can be the one of must-to-dos at Yeosu."
갈땐 쉽고 돌아오긴 힘든 ,갈때는 내리막길이라서 그냥 가는데 돌아올 때는 훅훅 페달돌리면서! 사진도 찍어주는데 기념으로 5000원 내고 샀다.(여행오면 그냥 열리는 내 지갑...)옆에 해변이 있는데 좀 일찍오거나 끝나고 가서 앉아있기 좋더라!Taking Rail bike by the ocean was a special experience to me and my sisters.There is a beach near this place. Visit and lay back when you want to get some rest. I took a bluetooth speaker with me and it was really very useful. 
Yeosu Ocean Rail Bike,A great experience to enjoy ocean beauty. Rail bike distance is around 2.5 miles and round trip takes 25 minutes. Recommended for visit. 
Nice trip to enjoy the coastal view,"This is a nice 45 mins round trip around the disused rail taking in the coastal sights. We came in a group of 4 via taxi, then paid for a 4 person rail bike, the Max a rail bike can take. It is also the cheapest rate. I feel there's no need to book online tickets first as timings are rather frequent and they have lots of bikes. Overall, a nice experience, good for family and friends as u peddle together and take in the sights. "
Yeosu Ocean Rail Bike,"I finally got to ride a rail bike in Korea. It was so much fun! The rail is a deserted train track which runs along the ocean. The bikes seat up to 4 people. My kids, age 2 and 4, had a fun time. It was easy going down hill into the cool mountain tunnel. There is a light show inside the tunnel. At the end of the tunnel an operator turns the rail bike around and you have to pedal uphill to get out. The Rail Bike is about 3000 won from Yeosu Exp train station. The operators were quite nice.Two people 20,000 won, 3 ppl 25, 000 won and 4 ppl 30,000 won. 20% off the ticket if you have an AquaPlanet ticket. We were able to leave our stroller in the ticket office.June is a great time to visit. There were no lines and we could ride at a leisurely pace. Manseung beach, Korea's only black sand beach is just a 5 minute walk from the Rail Bike."
