A must-see in autumn,"I went to Naejangsan almost every year in recent years. The autumn colours were fascinating. Admittedly they varied from year to year depending on weather conditions. This year, the summer was unusually long and the weather was dry, so the autumn colours were inferior to those of last year. It was also a cloudy day with very little sunshine, so the visit was a little disappointing. The consolation was that the sun came out momentarily when I was taking photos of the Uhwajeong Pavilion."
Autumn leaves ,"Stayed in Naejangsan for 3 nights in Haniljang Motel in the 1st week of November 19 which located very near to park entrance. The peak of foliage is on 2nd week of November this year. The foliage is beautiful even though it is not at its peak. The weather is very cold in the morning that we have to wear gloves and the sky is dark at 5pm. Tourist could buy park entrance ticket at 3000won/day at the entrance and walk a short distance to a ticket booth to buy the shuttle bus tickets at 1000won/way. The bus will go to cable car station. For those who do not go to the observatory, I would suggest to walk towards the Wooden gate and up Naejangsan temples for sightseeing instead. From the temples walk back cable car bus stop and another 4km back to park entrance, towards the Naejang Information Centre. In this journey you will expect to hear local musicians singing lovely songs, see beautiful and colorful foliage, serene pavilion and few tangerine trees. A short distance outside the park entrance, there are tents where the local sell their meals. Along the roadsides there are sale of fry red bean and ginseng fritters, seasonal small tangerine and persimmon, etc. There are many restaurants but only one coffee cafe and convenience store beside 171 bus stop. At the cable car station, there is a lotteria fast food restaurant selling burger and it opens at 7am. For tourists who do not prepare for hiking I do not suggest to take one way cable car to observatory and walk down as the route down is slippery and not much to see. Overall, we had enjoyed the Naejangsan National Park very much. A must visit place during autumn in Korea. "
Autumn Leaves Viewing without Hiking,"At the foot of the mountain, you can either take a bus (1000 won) or hike up. I decided t take the bus going up and then walk going down. The last week of October, is not exactly the peak of autumn, but there are yellow/red leaves already.I would suggest to go the temple first, then, start the hike down. On the way down you can see the pavilion in the middle of a river and pretty bridges. This is 4 hours by bus from Seoul, so be prepared for the long travel time."
A romantic autumn scenery in Korea,"Naejangsan is one of the most beautiful place to admire colorful foliage in autumn in Korea. It has a long line trees that turn into yellow and red in autumn. You can take a bus (1,000krw) to near to the cable car station. Don't forget check in at the beautiful lake near there and take the cable car to admire the whole view Naejangsan. The best time to admire foliage is on novembre"
Naejangsan - Jeonju-si- Busan ,"We visited on 28/10/2019 but only 30% of the leaves turn yellow n red. A bit disappointed, pls come at middle November I guess for the autumn peak foliage best views. We followed Klook tours from Seoul to here (cheaper than train) then we took bus 171(every 30mins, 1000Won) from national park to Jeongeup-si, then change another bus (4900won) to Jeonju-si. Don’t worry about the bus , many buses are there.. We overnight at Jeonju-si hanok village before departing for Busan the next day."
"Hiking: Iljumun~Dongguri Course, good views at tops but no red leaves","Naejangsan Visitor Centre->Byeongnyeonam, Seoraebong, Bulchulbong, Manghaebong, Yeonjibong, Kkachibong, Sinseonbong, Yeonjabong->Naejangsa Temple->Visitor Centre again. I didn’t get to Janggunbong as I worried about getting dark soon. I started the trail at 9:45am. By the time I reached back to the Visitor Centre it was 3:45pm. There were a lot of clear signs, but at times, especially at heights where places were rocky it’s difficult to tell where the route is. There are places that are steep and climbing is needed. I was using KT and I felt I had signal through the whole hike. I took the 7:10am bus from Jeonju bus terminus to Jeongeup bus terminus, which was a ~1hr10min ride. The stop of Bus 171, which takes passengers to Naejangsan National Park, is just 50 meters away from Jeongeup bus terminus. However by the time I arrived at the bus stop, two Filipinos told me the bus has just left. I talked to a taxi driver. He agreed to take us three to Naejangsan at W15000. The taxi ride was only 20 minutes (and we beat one bus 171!). We got off at where the shops were. I walked a bit further to something like an entrance, was told to hop onto a shuttle bus (with price W1000) and was dropped off at the Visitor Centre. I went there on 22 Oct. Too sad that it’s not yet time for leaves to turn fiercely red. Not gonna lie the hike was exhausting. My leg muscles were still sore two days after the hike and my toes were still hurt. But views at the tops are amazing."
Worth for hiking,"Autumn view at Naejangsan was beautiful. 4 hours bus journey from Seoul. Book your day trip from local Seoul travel agency at least 1 week, else you will miss your chance of a wonderful hike to the mountain top."
Amazing place for an Autumn visit,"My partner and I were fortunate to time our South Korean visit such that we were able to visit Naejangsan National Park in the first week of November. Just a very few leaves had begun to fall, which meant we must have visited at the peak autumn colours period. It was magnificent! I cannot advise what the park is like at other times of the year, although I assume it would still be an amazing place to visit. However, if you have any way of managing the timing of your visit, then do try to do it for the last week of October, or preferably the first week of November. Because of its popularity in Autumn, it was generally very busy with many thousands of people there on the day we visited. However, this park is so large, with many walking paths in and around the main touristy areas, that the numbers of people present really did not cause any problem to us whatsoever.From what we understand, no private cars OR tourist coaches are permitted to enter the main body of the park. Instead, all must park in one of two or three large parking areas on the outskirts. Then you can either walk the kilometre or so up into the main part of the park, OR you can buy tickets for a special bus that will save you the uphill walk. Our tour group ere provided with one-way such tickets to get us quickly into the main part of the park, on the understanding that the return trip was a beautiful downhill walk back to the main business, restaurant, and parking areas. The return walk downhill (and there were a couple of different path alternatives...) was extremely easy, and very enjoyable. In our case, we took the slightly longer return path down beside the small stream back to the shops and restaurants at the main entrance.There are a wide variety of restaurants and food stalls to choose from, assuming you plan to buy your lunch here.A thoroughly recommended visit, and would strongly suggest first week of November for the very best and brilliant autumn colours."
A little late for autumn,"We came second week of Nov, a little late for autumn as most trees were already leafless but still lovely and dramatic for photo ops :)"
Best Korea's Autumn spot for Domestic,"Unlike Seoraksan Mountain which is very popular among foreigner, Naejangsan National Park is less popular but really beatiful specially in autumn and it is one of the best autumn spot among domestic visitor. For budget traveller, after 3.5 hours journey to Jongeup station (Mugunghwa train), take local bus 171 to Naejangsan National Park directly."
A pleasure to visit in autumn,"I visited Naejangsan several times in the past. The experience varied, depending on the weather and on the timing ie for the best mix of autumn colours. Generally, late Oct. or early Nov. is the best time to go. One should choose a sunny day for seeing the best autumn colours. Photographing from under a maple or ginkgo tree, with sunlight from behind, at an oblique angle, will produce the best results.It is advisable to take the park shuttle minibus, near the entrance, to the terminus near the cable-car station. It saves a lot of walking. From there one could walk towards the temple and then walk back to the park entrance, passing by the lake where the Uhwajeong Pavilion lies. The pavilion is near the cable-car station."
Naejangsan autumn rendezvous,"Naejang means ‘many secrets’, so uncover the many hidden gems as you hike the changing shades of orange, gold and red along the maple leaf walkway. Be prepared for throngs and hordes of people as you make your way through the stalls selling food, restaurants, blaring music and dancing ajummas. Naejangsan is packed in autumn with locals and tourists alike, all there for trekking, family outing or simply for photography. Do start as early as possible! Savour the spectacular nature, breathe in fresh mountain air, and take in the tranquil waters. Rendezvous with the 108 Danpung Tunnel, a paved road lined with 108 fiery brilliant maple trees. The hidden Buddhist meaning of 108 is fascinating as it symbolises the worldly feelings and desires Buddhist hermits must remove. The cable car queue to summit can be a really long line, snaking to a two hours wait. So skip it and walk uphill to enjoy the beautiful landscape scenery."
Lovely red leaves in Autumn,"I joined the day tour from Busan, which took around 3 hours bus there. We spent 3 hours there for taking stunning photos as this is the red leaves season. Around 10-12am is still not a peak hour, but after that, all the locals and tours would make this place very crowd and noisy. There is a cable car (8000 won) which bring the tourists to the peak of the mountain. Our tour guide didn't recommend us to go as most of the red leaves were gone in the late autumn. Besides there is some trail for 2.5 hours which I saw some locals took it as well. Seems hiking is very popular as well!This is a wonderful place to visit which worth for a total 6-hour transportation from Busan to there."
Needs improvement ,"Went for autumn viewing and supposed to be peak foliage but wasn’t the case. This is a mountain really for hiking as we can see many locals all fully equipped. Pls give a miss on he cable car as the queue is horribly Long and seems only one carriage to and fro. We reached 8am and the queue is already Super Super Long. Should queue at least two hours to take the ride up and another two hours to come down. We decided to do the hiking route. Only managed to stop at Bulchubong, which is their intermediate route. Couldn’t proceed further to the peak as it really required hiking equipment and the steps are really steep. The view along the way is awesome and should be beautiful when the leaves are in full bloom. Besides the scenery, the mountain is definitely not catered for tourism as there is only one local bus from city to the mountain. One way traffic and can really jam during peak season. Toilet and other facilities are run down, seriously needs to be improved in order to attract more tourists to the beautiful mountain. "
Autumn foliage at Naejangsan National Park,Beautiful autumn foliage. Best times to go: mid Oct to early Nov. There are day tours departing from Seoul (Myeongdong Station). 
Nice cool autum air at Naejangsan ,Took the cable car to Observatory pavilion. Park entrance is 3000won each. Cable car is 8000 won each. 
beautiful place with good hiking area,although getting crowded sometimes but i love this beautiful place & good for hiking. it has great view. i took Seoraebong Peak route & that was good. spend a day to do the hiking & take picture. that was quite enjoyable.
Picturesque Naejangsan in Autumn,"I learned about this round trip bus tour from Seoul to Naejangsan from Jeonbuk Shuttle Center. They sent me a notice since I joined a bus tour going to Jeonju in 2013. I paid 10,000 won. I registered for this trip since my Korean autumn adventure in 2017 fit the said bus tour schedule. Pick-up and drop-off was at Gwanghwamun Square. After 4 hours of travelling (this is a good time to rest and sleep), we arrived at Naejangsan National Park. The tour assistant told us how to get around the place. There were many restaurants and stores to choose from since by this time we we were already hungry. After walking around and taking pictures and videos (of course!) we went back to the bus at 5:00PM to go back to Seoul. This is a relax tour to try specially if you had a full-packed schedule the day before. "
Great autumn experience ,"Magnificent experience. The environment was so romantic, filled with colourful leaves. It’s well maintained. Clean & made friendly for inexperienced mountain trackers like me. "
Beautiful changing of colors,"The perfect time to go is beginning of Nov. From Seoul, I took the KTX from Yongsan station to Jeong-Eup station, took about 1.5 hours. From Jeong-Eup train station, cross the road at the traffic light, by the CU store there is a 171 bus (see the enclosed map) which goes direct to Naejang san as the final stop (takes about 30 mins). There's no decent hotel in Jeong-Eup, they are all motel. I didn't stay at Jeong-Eup and decided to stay at one of the motels in Naejang san instead, its right next to the national park which is very convenient if you want to beat the crowd in the morning. I stay at the following motel, which is good, Mr. Wontak Kim speaks good English and very responsive via e-mail, have a look at maple-village dotcom for more info. The motel is right behind the Naejang san bus stop, its 20 mins walk to the national park entrance제일장(第一莊): MAPLE-VILLAGETel: 82-63-538-9639Mobil: 82-10-5283-6803Following are some useful translation between English - Chinese - Korean for the area,Jeongeup - 井邑 - 정읍Jeongeup station - 井邑站 - 정읍역Yongsan station - 龍山站 - 용산역Baek Yang temple - 白羊寺 - 백양사Baek Yang temple station - 白羊寺站 - 백양사역"
Maple leaves everywhere in Naejangsan,You definitely have to visit Naejangsan during autumn season. scene here has his reputation and you would like to stay here till autumn ends. Naejangsan deserves it as the No. 1 sightseeing place in Korea!
Absolutely stunning fall folliage!,"This year’s peak fall folliage at Naejangsan was forecasted to be on 8 Nov. Visited on 7 Nov (weekday) and was truly amazed by the beautiful autumn view!Highly recommended to visit in autumn and on weekdays, as I’ve heard from the locals that the mountain would be extremely packed on weekends. Many locals and visitors queued to take the cable car ride at Naejangsan which cost 6,000 won for a round trip and 4,000 won for a single trip. I recommend to climb up and down instead -- it only takes about 30-40mins to climb up and about 20mins to go down. You can just follow the directional sign that says “Observatory Peak” after you pass by the temple. It’s a totally different experience as compared to squeezing with people inside the cable car.At the foot of Naejangsan, there are also lots of eateries and food stalls to explore. One can get to Naejangsan by taking local bus 171 from the bus stop next to CU convenience store beside the Jeongeup bus terminal. The ride takes about 25mins. From Naejangsan back to Jeongeup bus terminal or Jeongeup station, take the same bus 171 from the left side of CU convenience store. There is no bus stop sign there but you can definitely see a queue waiting for bus, so don’t miss it! Both rides cost 1,400 won per way. :-)"
"Autumn foliage visible but alas, we were too early !",Was there last week of October 2017 but autumn foliage not fully peaked. I went during a weekday so no hoards of people and was able to take many pictures without being photo bombed. Clean toilets around so don't worry too much about that. Cable car ride to the peak was lovely and there was a particular spot at the top of the lookout where the maple leaves were particularly bright red. We queued (in a civilized way) to take photos with that.The temple was under construction so wasn't able to take many great photos of that. The trail down to the temple from the cable car viewing platform was a killer but the locals (old and young) seemed to find it easy to maneuver down with the agility of mountain goats. It was amazing. The place in general has been commercialised so expect elements of gift shops etc to be found in many areas. The touts outside the park will attempt to confuse you into parking near their restaurants. Do not give in to them. Restaurant waiters do not speak very good English. Remember to bring your google translate app or you might be confused into ordering an expensive massive family feast.
Autumn Foliage,"We went there in mid-November last year. We went with a tour group. They picked us up at Myeongdong train exit early in the morning. A tour guide will be there on the bus, when you get to Naejang he walk with you and take photos of you til the entrance then you will be on your own to see the temple and to walk around. He wasn't even that clear where else you can go after you have seen the temple.I was expecting an actual hike but since we went we the a tour group, we were on the touristy side of the mountain. I got a little bored so we walked all the way behind the temple and found a small house who happens to sell their own makgeolli. You will actually see the big clay pots. There were an ahjusshi and ahjumma living there and selling food. They don't speak English but the uncle did try. There were tables and chairs outside and it is not a covered area so we had to finish our fishcake soup before it rains. It was drizzling later that afternoon.That house is right in the middle of those trees so you will feel so close to nature. No insects or mosquitoes. It was quiet and a nice spot for nature tripping.The autumn colors was really amazing last year. On our way up we were on the bus but on our way back we have to walk down through the trees. There were a lot of tourists and locals around. The local hikers will bring a mat, drink, snack and chat with their friends most on their hike gear.The highlight of the trip, other than the autumn colors, was the mini festival going on there. There were a lot of food and exotic snacks. They sell a lot of ginseng and I even tried one of the silkworms. If you are a hiker, just go with an actual hiking group. Do a lot of research as it looked like you can easily get lost in that mountain. If you are going with a tour group, walk past the temple and follow the path there past a small stream. You will find the house in the middle with chairs and tables outside that I mentioned.Try the food at the foot of the mountain, near the parking area. We spent more time there than the anywhere else in Naejang. It was a nice autumn foliage spot and I recommend to just hire a car and a driver instead of commuting to get there. You probably don't need a tour group too."
Glorious Autumn Colours not to be Missed,"I fell in love instantly upon seeing the pictures in the website by chance and was determined to visit South Korea again. There are various ways to reach this destination depending on your starting point. We started our journey from Busan by taking a direct bus from Busan Seobu Sasang Bus Terminal to Jeongeup Bus Terminal. This bus runs twice daily at 9:20 am and 11 am (no online booking). If you miss this, there's another route with more frequencies that requires changing of bus in U-Square, Gwangju. From Jeongeup Bus Terminal, take bus no. 171 for half an hour to reach the entrance to Naejangsan Park. There is accommodation at the park. If one is into hiking, it is recommended to put up at least one night. When we visited during the 2nd week of November, room was still available in one of the hotels we inquired. The landscape was illuminated by the vibrant and amazing colours. The maple leaves were fiery red. There were plenty of photogenic views, so get ready your battery, power bank, tripod, etc. We started our day before 7:30 in the morning, we visited the Uhwajeong Pavilion, took the cable car ride to the observatory, hiked to Naejangsa Temple. From this temple, we continued to Wonjeokam. We took our sweet time hiking, strolling and immersing in the autumn colours coupled with the cool and fresh air. However, due to the drizzle for the entire 2nd half of the day, some portions of the trail were slippery, we had to abandon the intended trail. We made a turn to Byeokryeonam Temple instead. From here, we proceeded to the entrance to Naejangsa Temple, the Maple Tunnel, the Visitor Center, and eventually back to the park entrance.Should we have one more day, we would have explored the other hiking route, Baekyangsa. If you have the luxury to stay in any nearby city for a long period of time, you can consider visiting twice if the colour of the foliage is not at its peak during your first visit."
Amazing and Stunning,I have been there last year at the very peak Foliage period. It was amazing and stunning. I still remember the feeling at that moment It is like time have stopped at that day. No words can be explain how beautiful amazing of Red blossom.
"Beat the crowds, get there early","Naejangsan is most popular in late October and early November. Looking at the reviews here, it appears that most people come all the way from Seoul. Given the distance, that will mean arriving late morning (or almost noon) and hitting the crowds.That said, it's a big national park, and if you walk deep in, you will find quiet. But you'll still need time to walk deep in and it would be better if you got in before the tour buses arrived.The nearest town is Jeongeup (sometimees spelt as Jongeup, Jongeub, Jeongeub, etc). I thought I might stay overnight there before going (early) to Naejangsan, but couldn't find any accommodation options online. The next best bet was to stay in Jeonju. So that's what I did, and below, I will detail how to go cheaply from there to Naejangsan.I stayed in the Hanok Village of jeonju. I took a local bus (#163, 1,200 won) at about 8am from Paldal Road to the west of Hanok Village to the Intercity Bus Terminal on Garinae Road. At the terminal, I bought a ticket (4,300 won) from a machine (English available) to Jeongeup. Buses depart every ten or twenty minutes. I boarded the 8:20am bus which arrived at Jeongeup intercity bus terminal at 9:25am.From there, I walked out to the main road and turned left (without crossing the road). About 50 - 100 metres away was a local bus stop where I waited for bus #171. This bus is not frequent. It comes to this bus stop at 9:00am, 9:45am, 10:15am, 10:45am and so on. I got onto the 9:45am bus (1,400 won) which arrived at Naejangsan gate at 10:10am (the #171 bus route ends there).You'll find yourself in a biggish souvenir-stalls camp with no clear directions to the main gate of Naejangsan park. Just follow your instincts and the flow of people. It's another 500m or so to the entrance to the park. Entry fee 3,000 won. At that hour, it was busy, but not yet crowded. Even so, keep walking for another 1 - 2 km to be free of people.To return to Jeonju, follow the same route in reverse.Altogether, it's a bit of time and effort getting there, but it's a beautiful place and well worth it. Others have posted photos here on Trip Advisor, and they are accurate representations. Needless to say, avoid weekends."
Memory of first mountain trip in Korea,"Though it’s been nearly one year since I visited Naejangsan (내장산) National Park, my feelingfor this place’s still fresh. We hiked and climbed to highest rocky peaks on mountain tops andenjoy looking down on the amazing trails we had been through. It was an overwhelminglyvictorious sense.I was mesmerized by radiant colors of leaves, fascinated by tranquil lakes, stunned byimmense mountains and relaxed by pure sky in this area. Naejangsan is like a heaven on earth.In Spring and Summer, the mountain gives a luscious green, while in Autumn, the color listextends to red, yellow, orange, pink, and more; all exists together in a period of time.Experiencing this colorful scene in a sunny Autumn day is wonderful treat to the eye that I willnever forget. Then, at the beginning of Winter, this place is covered by white snow all over thetrees and mountains, with red leaves on the ground. At that time, the snowy peaks are quite asight to see. The nature outdoes itself by painting the calming, romantic and exceptional scenery.My profile picture on Facebook was shot at Naejangsan. Since it’s one of the best photos I’vegot so far, I keep it as my avatar for months. Probably, I will visit Naejangsan again this year andget a new one!"
Great place for autumn foliage,1.5 hours from Seoul via KTX to reach the small town Jeongeup. 30min bus ride to reach Naejangsan. Amazing view of red leaves in autumn. Jeongeup is a very small town and I found it a bit difficult to find suitable food. 
My virgin trip to Naejangsan,"It's the most worthwhile place throughout my 9D trip to South Korea. I made a day trip to Naejangsan on my 4th day at Seoul. It's my virgin trip travelling alone in a foreign country and I felt good. I took a bus to Jeongeup from Central City bud terminal. It's a 3-hours bus ride and it cost about 21500₩ since it was a luxury & comfortable coach. Take a local bus #71 at a nearby bus stop (about 50m from Jeongeup bus terminal). The bus which I took was 'sardines-packed' with ahjussi & ahjumma fully geared in hiking attires. The journey to the foothill of Naejangsan takes about 30minutes at a bus fare of 1400₩. I strolled for about 10 minutes (from the drop-off point) before I see the main entrance to the park. I paid 3000₩ entrance fee and continue my journey. There's option of taking a mini bis ride to the cable car station at 1000₩ but I chose walking to enjoy the most beautiful scenery I have ever seen. The distance to the cable car station was about 30-45minutes walk but the picturesque autumn foliage erased my tiredness of walking. I paid 8000₩ for the return cable car trip. The queue line for the ride was long and waited for about 20-30 minutes for my turn. In summary, I spent 4 hours at the park and make my trip back to Seoul by 530pm bus."
Beautiful autumn,I followed one day local tour to Naejangsan on 2 Nov. We assembled at Myeongdong station exit no. 2 at 6:40 am and came back around 7:30-8 pm depends on traffic. The coach journey took about 3 hrs 50 minutes (one-way from Seoul) including one toilet stop for 20 minutes. We were told that the autumn foliage is only 40% bloom at that time and that full bloom was expected on 13 Nov 2016. I visited a temple and turquoise green lake just before taking the cable car up which we queued for 30 minutes. There are lots of persimmons trees around and being sold along the street stalls. The autumn scene along the lake is the most beautiful. Mainly maple leaves.
Autumn colours ,It is beautiful with the colours of maple leaves in red hues and others in yellow and pale green. Try to be there before 10am to avoid the crowd. We went by KTX from Yongsan station to Jeongeup. Board bus 171 then a short walk to park entrance. Do not go on weekends as it is too crowded. 
Amazing red leaves and a must-see in autumn,"Naejangsan is one of my favourites in S. Korea. In late Oct. or early Nov. the place is a hot tourist spot. It is an excellent place to see red maple leaves. In late Oct. there is a mix of colours ie red, yellow and green as the leaves are changing colours. Early Nov. is a better time for those who want to see a more intense red. It is a fairly level walk along a maple-tree-lined road so it is good for the whole family to visit. Go there at noon on a sunny day and the sunlight will penetrate the red leaves. One could easily shoot great photos, especially when red leaves are accompanied by temple/ people scenes."
Amazing in Autumn,"well, i recommend you to visit this beautiful place during autumn, from mid of October to the end of November, when the leaves are turned into orange and red."
Beautiful Naejangsan,"Beautiful Naejangsan! I've been there twice, a decade apart, there is a cable car built in the area now. Even more tourists and hikers than before. But the nature, especially during autumn, is still captivating. From Seoul or Jeonju, express bus to Jeongeup, then local bus #171 or 171-1 to Naejangsan. The local bus is a small vehicle and very often it is full. If you are in a group of four or can group with other visitors at the bus stop, share a taxi is a faster option to get to the destination."
Autumn Foliage Hunt !,Manage to do a day trip to Naejangsan National Park.Bus ride from Express Bus Terminal (Seoul) to Jongeup Bus Terminal. Then take bus 171 to Naejangsan Park. Walked from bus terminal until Naejangsa Temple. Super long queue at the cable car. Breathtaking views of autumn foliage.
perfect area for full-day maple leave photogarphy,"I went there for a second time over the part 2 years as 2 years ago I arrived late and managed to visit only a minor part of the park and missed the major part on one single cloudy day as a result of poor tour operator arrangement and traffic jams. I was lucky enough to spend a full day under a blue sky in the major part (the Enclosure Temple and pavilion-on-lake side) with mostly very good to perfect photos and a morning in the minor part (the White Goat Temple side) under a cloudy sky with photos which were not bad. What made the real difference was the planning ahead with maple sighting and weather forecasts and the tour arrangement made by the tour operator. Overall, I do agree that this national park ranks top among all South Korean locations for maple leaf sightings and photography even though I have not yet managed to travel to all other relevant locations in this nation. If you cannot afford the time or cost to go to a few location for maple leaf sighting or photography, this park is your best and only choice. Tourist traffic control remains to be an issue to make this park a greater attraction as traffic jams and littering are 2 complaints foreign visitors tend to have. Staying for 1 full day with earliest morning arrival and a ride in the cable car in the afternoon are the must for every first-timer indeed. The lake surrounding the pavilion and the other lake by a temple are the best locations for enjoying the fun of taking postcard-class photos with a spectrum of coloured leaves before you and as reflected on the lake surface. Your enjoyment level will be directly proportionate to the amount of sunshine you have at the time of your maple leaf sighting. Minimise your meal times while in the park to maximise your fun since you will always find better eateries and dishes away from the countryside areas anyway. Tripod seems a must for visitors carrying heavy photographic equipment, but if you do not aim at generating huge coloured photos for display or professional purposes I will think a strong digital super-zoomer like 50 X will maximise your enjoyment especially if your visit is only one of at least three running days of photographic or hiking trips."
Autumn wonderland alright,"We based ourselves in Gwangju and travelled to the park by car within an hour to arrive around 7.30am. As it was before the official opening time, no entrance fees were collected and we walked to the bus stop to catch the 1,000 won shuttle to the cable car station. Although the official start time was stated as 8am, when we arrived before 8am the first cable car out was just arriving the peak - we were most impressed with the Koreans' flexibility about starting before the official start time.We promptly boarded the cable car and enjoyed our walk to the various lookouts before descending by cable car. Then we began our leisurely stroll back to the park entrance. On the 4th Nov when we visited, the autumn colours were not fully visible - we overhead a Korean explaining to his English-speaking guests that the foliage was just 60% out. But boy! What a great difference just one day makes. On the next morning when we arrived just after 10am, we noticed the park was so much more colourful - we attributed it to the warm day the day prior and the cold night that must have accelerated the onset of the autumn foliage.We had a great time taking even more spectacular shots on the 5th Nov, our second visit besides wandering off to the parks by the side of the road and walkway to just take in all that autumn splendour.I was really glad to have planned 2 days at Naejangsan - on day 1 we spent around 5 hours before adjourning to Damyang for lunch and a walk around the bamboo forest. On the second day, we spend around 3 hours in Naejangsan before adjourning to Jeonju for lunch and driving back to Seoul. However as we left Jeonju at 3pm, we got into a terrible traffic jam on the way back to Seoul - it could be because it was a Friday - and arrived in Seoul after 6.30pm. I think I would plan to drive back to Seoul in the mornings to avoid such bad traffic jams.Certainly, Naejangsan is a beautiful place and I would not hesitate to return if I am anywhere near Jeongju as it is less than an hour away by car."
Spectacular Autumn scenery,"We had a group of four that visited this park in late October 2015, the entrance to the park is easily accessible via bus No. 171 from Jeongeup railway station. We took the walk from the information centre near the entrance to the park rather than shuttle bus as the walk was worthwhile with the amazing autumn colour. Walked through the Maple tree tunnel and it was truly exhilarating.Recommend to stay 2 nights in Jeongeup as it is convenient. We spent half a day visiting the Hanok village in Jeonju on day of arrival and the 2nd day we spent the whole day at the National Park. The scenery are exactly like what we saw on website.Recommend to stay at Message Hotel at Jeongeup as they provide excellent service though they speak minimum English. The room is spacious and clean. We had difficulty locating this hotel via Internet however, with the help of friend, I was able to get the Telephone contact and they are: mobile 010 8814 0016 and tel. 063 535 5988.PNAL"
Best hiking trip in Korea,"I and my fiance love to walk around anywhere. we visited this national park early June 2015. Because It was very cool inside park, that is why we felt good during hiking even summer. The Mong bla~ waterfall, I forgot the correct name, is very nice. It is not so large or high, but it is enough to take a break and made us feel calm with beautiful green forest. We felt in love this korea national park. When we get a child, we like to here again.If you are cool hiker, I recommend to visit this park. There are many course like from 1 hour to 6 hour course."
Autumn FairyTale,"Last November I travelled to South Korea and couldn't miss a chance to visit one of the most beautiful national parks in autumn. It took me about 3 hours to get there by bus from Seoul to Jeongeup. Then I took a bus to the park itself and in 40 minutes I was in Naejangsan.At the beginning of November it collected all bright colours at their best. Don't be afraid of huge crowds- it's not so awful as they say. The place is really worth going and watching the multicoloured trees, breathing fresh air,admiring fragrant streams and visiting temples."
Very Beautiful Autumn Scenary,"I visited the Park early Nov. The view is spectacular with colorful leaves, red, orange, yellow, green. We walked uphill and downhill to enjoy the beautiful scenes."
Long journey but worth it,"fantastic view during the autumn , visited early nov 2014 it was super duper cold...transportation was a bit of an issue from seoul city, 2.5 hrs via KTX or bus to jeongeup city. spent a night in Message Hotel (new, nice, clean motel) , costs around usd115 for a two single bed room. It is a family run motel , good customer service and friendly boss. cheaper alternative to reach jeongeup city is via bus, instead of KTX which costs around usd55-60. Bus would be around one third or quarter of the price of KTX if no wrong. the transport from jeongeup to naejangshan was totally inconvenient , packed like canned sardine.... if u are lucky u get a seat, if not will need to stand an hour plus to reach there or get back. kinda regret didnt manage to spend more days exploring naejangshan , cable car , hiking etc. most of the tourist were koreans , cant even see a westerner , south east asians / chinese / also very limited :) btw, they shouldnt collect entrance fee from foreign tourists as foreigners are exempted ...only locals need to pay...."
beautiful autumn leaves,"went there during peak of autumn,was cold after 4pm and crowded with local and foreign tourist.From town take bus 171, bus stop was near train station and tourist information center.bus terminal is also about 5min by foot from train station.bus ride about 25 min but the bus did bring you quite close to the entrance but still about 10 min walk to the ticketing office.cable car station was another 10 to 15min walk,for those who choose not to walk can take a mini bus ,which cost about 1000 won but only to the cable car station.We choose to walk like the rest of korean who enjoyed walking and hiking,scenery was beautiful during autumn,we saw autumn leaves from yellow,orange and red 'zone'..will recommend to people who wish to see autumn leaves,it was the top 4 mountains to see autumn,compare to seoraksan which we visited 1 week ago,i will give naejangsan 5 stars to see autumn in korea."
Great national park with cable car!!!,"I want to write this review so that more visitors from the English-speaking community can know about this beautiful place.This national park is very famous for viewing autumn leaves foliage. Even on a regular Tuesday and Wednesday in late October (when we visited the park), there are a lot of local Koreans visiting the park at day time. This park is easily accessible from Seoul. Take KTX from Seoul to Jeongeup station. There are tourist information center right outside of the station. Ask for bus #171, which as a bus stop across the street from the KTX station. Bus #171 is a circular line, so you don't have to worry about the direction of the bus line - if you get on a #171, it will get you to the national park. Once you get on #171, it takes about 30 mins to go to the terminal, which is a small town with restaurants and tourist motels. (To go back to Jeongeup, get on the same #171 at the same spot.)Walking from the town to the national park entrance takes about 15 mins. There is only 1 major road, so you won't get lost. At the park entrance, pay 3000 won / adult for the fee. From there, you have the option of walking into the park's Cable Car station (takes about 45 mins), or taking the shuttle (1000 won/person) to the Cable Car station directly.The Cable Car will attract a lot of people after 10 a.m. (see my pictures). For this reason, I would recommend the following itinerary: go to Jeongeup and stay for a night, and wake up early and enter the park at around 7:30-8 a.m. Take the 1000 won shuttle from the entrance to the Cable Car. From there, take the cable car up the mountain and walk to the Observation Tower (an easy walk of about 300 meter). You will see a breathtaking view. Then, go back to the Cable Car station and take Cable Car downhill, and walk to other attractions such as Naejang Temple and the ""maple leaves tunnel"". To leave the park, walk 45 mins back to the entrance (or take the 1000 won shuttle if you're tired)."
"Excellent view, except weather could be quite chilly","It's a bit disappointed when you come in a midst of rain, as it will become very chilly and especially hard to walk on a wet, muddy road. Come with sport shoes that allows you to walk easily, raincoat/umbrella (in case it rains), and enough clothes/jacket to keep you warm!We took a bus that cost 1000w to go into the cable car station and decided to walk out on foot (should be an easy 30-min walk to the outer entrance but you easily take an hour+ as you take lots of photos all along)"
Autumn has just started,We visited the park on the 23rd Oct 14. Autumn has started and therefore didn't get to see the gorgeous colours that we had seen 3 years back.In case you can visit during the weekdays there is definately less people around.We still enjoyed the walk and the colors that we could see.
Excellent for a very quiet weekend escape from Seoul,I went with to Naejansan during the fall last year. The closest town is on the KTX line and has bus connections to Seoul. There were plenty of hikes to suit all abilities and a cable car. I strongly recommend trying the local Mokoli (Korean Rice Wine).
A nice place to visit,"I spent a day here in Feb, when the trees were bare - not the best time, perhaps! However, there are plenty of good trails, some nice temples and the cable car is fun. Worth a visit."
Visit in Early Morning,"I stayed in Jeongeup (city 30 min. ride from Naejansan) and took an early bus ride (No. 171) at 8:30 am to Naejansan. You may enjoy the morning peace of the area. After 10 am, there'll be crowd of people for queuing for cable car. To see the area from hill top observatory is excellent. But avoid to waste time for queuing for cable car, you should go early or in late afternoon. If you like hiking, it's a good place (time from 1 hr to 4 hr). The best season is early November (I went in end Oct. but some maple leaves did turn red)."
