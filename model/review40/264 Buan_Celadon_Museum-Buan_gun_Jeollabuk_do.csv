Celadon making experience,"We were here to make an exciting experience. My daughter tried to make a bowl-shaped celadon. Initially she kneaded the clay and stacked it high. And then an instructor helped her make the bowl-shape like the image below. Lastly she inscribed what she wanted to draw on the surface. The bowl she made now has to be baked twice soon, in the meantime its surface will be coated. It will take a few weeks more. They promised to us it will be delivered within 2 months."
Explore Buan Celadon Museum,"This is a really good Museum to browse through, it suits adults and children too. Discover how the pottery is made, the exhibition rooms are really well set out, and there is things for the kids to do also. Often there tents set up outside the museum where you can buy pottery and other things, definitely worth a visit if you are in Buan."
