Good sight,I went there as part of a guided tour. They took us there and we went to the new observatory up the hill. It's really steep. From the observatory you can see the neighbour. I have been lucky because the weather was good and I could see really far.
If you want to see north korea side,"This is quite sensitive area, you need to bring your passport or visa or ID to enter. You are not allowed to take photos of soldiers and military equipmentsThis place offers you a great view of both North and South Korea. You can observe North Korea Goengsan industrial complex. Beside the view was really beautiful."
Look at North Korea,The Dora Observatory overlooks North Korea. it is near the South Korea propaganda village and overlooks the North Korean propoganda village. Look at the 2 giant flagpoles. A great place for people interested in history and cold war politics.
Great Views,Pretty special place to visit. Walk all the way up to the observatory and you can see into North Korea across the DMZ. Really puts the place into context. Great experience and very lucky to have been there.
Observatory in DMZ,We visited the Dora Observatory as part of a Seoul City Tour of the DMZ. The tour of the DMZ is the most popular tour that you can take while in Seoul as everyone is interested in what is happening in North Korea.Dora Observatory is a modern observatory that allows you to look across the countryside to North Korea. What fun.
Brilliant Views of North Korea,"Fantastic views across the DMZ and into North Korea. There are mounted binculars for you to use for free and you can see people working in the fields, North Korean guards at their post, the massive North Korea flag fluttering in the breeze You get to see the nearest city to the border and you can easily make out individual buildings and statues.After spending a day in the DMZ it was great to get such a good glimpse into such a mysterious and forbidden place.There are great views of the south from the other side of the observatory."
A spot of Memories,"Dorasan Hill is a high land of 156 meters above sea level. During the Korean War, this has been changed hands between the South and the North three times and mines were numerous as evidenced along the road we escalating to the Observatory. Here mainly is a view point to see North Korea closest at hand. Propaganda village and farmland of North Korea are spread just ahead, and some city area of Gaeseong , Gaeseong Industrial Complex and a bronze statue of Kim Il-Seung can be seen through a telescope.The deficit at this observatory is not 360° and also lack of illustrations for directions of point of interest at telescopic locations. Also, telescopes are too densely located without considering the enthusiasm of tourists.Nevertheless, hopefully these telescopes will became a redundancy as eventually Dorasan Hill will be changed, like Lok Ma Chau of China Hong Kong, no longer a tourist spot of Memories but to be an international exchange center. "
One of the highlight in visiting DMZ!,One of the highlight in visiting DMZ! It is on top of a hill where you can look at the North Korea land using provided binoculars. The view is breathtaking. 
Dora Observatory ~ See North Korean Soldiers!,"If you are lucky, and the weather is not that hazy. You can see North Korean soldiers on the other end. This will give you a view of both North and South Korean flags."
Part of the DMZ Tour,"This is one of the stops on the DMZ tour and there are telescopes to peer into North Korea. Because the JSA was closed to us, this was as close as we were to get."
Look into north korea,"I thought this was fascinating. From the observation deck you can look over the border and into North Korea. They have free telescopes which look into the ‘propaganda village’ - so called because apparently no one lives there, the windows are painted on the buildings and despite looking like 3-4 story buildings the buildings infact have no floors. Can be busy to look through the scopes but didn’t have to wait long. Souvenir shop selling North Korean wine. "
Good scenery but not spectacular,"Actually this place isn't really impressive, they use this place in the past as monitoring place as they need to see the border of southwest Korea and North korea. Nearby this place there is another building that you can see north korea from the provided binocular, you can see it clearly when the weather is nice."
Great views & good cafe,Really enjoyed this as part of a day tour of the DMZ. Had a nice light lunch with great views over North Korea... new facilities look great
Really just a view but a good view,"You mainly come here to get a good view of the whole area, especially of the villages inside the DMZ and of North Korea. Good thing is that there is a restaurant if you want to relax and the binoculars on the top are free."
Good views,"You get a good view from up here to North Korea, not that the country looks very different than the South, though. The binoculars are free."
You can see North Korea from far,"Free to use the binoculars to view North Korea from the observatory. If you are lucky, you can see people walking/working around a field out there. Can see the South and North flags from here."
Look into North Korea,"This observatory is situated in the DMZ and is the closest you can get to North Korea. From the observatory platform you can see, through many pairs of binoculars, into the North. You can see the propaganda village with its huge flag pole and N Korean flag as well as the, now abandoned,Gaesong industrial complex. The extensive use of barbed wire all round the area, as well as watch tours enhance the general atmosphere of cold war."
Views of the North,You can view North Korea border from the observatory. But there seem to be no difference between the 2 countries except that the height of the flag pole of North seem to be a little higher . Other than that there is an auditorium and quaint coffee shop .
Impressive to see ,Coming there you have to climb up to the new building and then to the third floor to take a sneak peak to North Korea. If you’re lucky you see some soldiers over there. The propaganda village (without people) and the huge flag pole is interesting as well!
North Korea doesn't look any different to the South!,"If a visit to the Tower is a highlight of the tour it shows overall how poor the tour is. Yes, its mildly interesting to see north Korea from afar, but there was no context just telescopes showing fields and hills and some buildings.....but nothing more."
Fascinating ,"It’s strangely fascinating to get a peak into the mysterious and secluded country of North Korea. Needless to say, it’s much better on a clear day, but either way, being so close to N Korea and seeing the N Korean flag in the distance is already worth it "
Cloudy day views,We visited the Dora Observatory on rainy day at Febryary. Couldn't see the North Korea clearly at this time.
Cloudy day but still good views into North Korea,We visited the Dora Observatory as part of a tour and the highlight was using the high-powered telescopes to get a glimpse into North Korea. We were able to see the propaganda village a few buildings. Would have been better if we had blue skies.
Peace seems so close...let's hope,Great vantage point from which too peer into N Korea. It was a bit foggy but through the binoculars we saw a N Korean soldier on their tower. So hard to believe the danger that lies in this demarcation zone (2 000 000 landmines???!!!) when it just seems calm and lovely. What a dichotomous experience!
Open-minded,North Korea through the lens of South Korea observatory. You really need to have an open mind after seeing these landscapes through those lenses. It got me enquire more information as to what I witnessed and what led to the barren landscapes. 
Dora Observatory,"You can see the North korea from here, better to have a good binoculars so you can see it clearly. They just open new observatory building"
Decent view,"This was one of the stops on our tour of the DMZ. It was quite crowded when we visited possibly due to the school vacations. We could get glimpses of houses in the North but that was about it. I guess to truly get a real picture, one would have to visit the North itself."
Fall in Paju,"Out of all the DMZ places we stopped at, Dora had the most historical information. Really learned a lot. And there are free binoculars on the roof deck where you can view North Korea. It's free. Almost 5 star toilets. There's a cafe too. Good places to take photos. "
Good view OF The north ,"IT was a steep climb to The observatory but worth IT upon reaching The TOP. ON The second floor you can view The Northern side. A video presentation OF The north Korea view is well discussed explaining The area. The statue OF Kim, The fake Village etc. Good photo op area."
Excellent place to experience the divided Korea.,1. ID card (passport) needed.2. reservation essential.3. No entrance fee.4. New building is waiting for you.
Best view of Both sides of Korea,"We visited this in organised tour .The view is better only if it is clear day.It is worth seeing through Binoculars.It is struggle to get one as the viewing area is crowded and only few available.The climb up is steep,Take Elevator as much as you can, if required needed.Allow plenty of time to take in the atmosphere of divided Countries through wars.thanks"
Fascinating views into North Korea,"This was another stopover point on our half day tour of the DMZ. The views from the observatory at the top of Dora Hill (Dorasan) over towards North Korea are fascinating. There is a large map that helps you to identify the main points of interest. Unfortunately on the day we visited there were no binoculars available to peer in more detail. But we could still make out Kijong-dong the North Korean “Propaganda Village” with it’s enormous flagpole. And of course the competing flagpole on the South Korean side of the divide. In the distance you can also see the transmission tower which is there to block out South Korean TV and radio from the North.Around this area there is certainly a lot of barbed, razor wire, bunkers and helpful little signs warning you about mines which have been laid. And with a huge amount of military presence, typically in the form of heavily armed young lads in their early twenties, it's testament to being one of the most hostile borders on the planet"
Insight into North Korean propoganda,"A stop at the Dora Observatory is a must on any tour to the DMZ. Lined with a number of high power binoculars, spending a few hundred yuan for a couple of minutes viewing is an absolute must to understand the stark differences between the North and the South and see the flags flying on both sides of no-man's-land. Seeing the unlived in buildings and the vehicles going about their business is intriguing."
Great place to experience the DMZ,Easy access to viewing point where you can see into the north. See a watch tower for North Korea. You can also see the shuttered manufacturing facility where folks from the north were employed before recent sanctions. Well done and maintained.
Checking North Korea,"As part of our DMZ tour, we stopped by Dora Observatory where they have huge binoculars your can look through to see a glimpse of North Korea. We were very fortunate the day we went as we could see a lot of people movements in North Korea, mostly people tending their farms. The observatory is up the hill which give you a good vantage point to look into North Korea down below."
Lucky with weather,"This is where you can look into North Korea. Was real lucky with the weather, clear and could even make out the Kim Il Sung 20 m statue and workers out and about. If you have a camera with really good zoom, bring it. The binoculars are not that good even if there are plenty of them for 500 won for 2 minutes. "
DORA OBSERVATORY,"I have been here in 2002, during world cup. Panoramic view of North Korea border and tunnels are the most interesting parts. This is a must see tour in Seoul. Tunnels are prepared for invading south by north, all in granite rocks, painted to black and claimed it was coal mines by north."
Nice view of North Korea,"This observatory just gives you a panoramic view of a North Korean town. Other than that, there is not much left to do (other than cardboard photo oppostunities with some cast of Descendants of the Sun)."
View straight into North Korea,"The Dora observatory is a viewing platform on a hill that allows you to see directly into North Korea. There’s binoculars that you can use for 500 Won for 2 minutes and it’s well worth it just for the closer glimpse into a closed off country/. I was able to see North Korean soldiers moving around in their watch tours and standing outside looking in our direction. All very surreal!! The model village is just that and they no longer play propaganda messages over loud speakers so if you are going expecting that then it all stopped earlier this year. The Dora observatory is VERY busy but I only had to wait less than a minute to get to the front which wasn’t bad. I only gave it 4 stars as there could be more information signs showing you what you could see. There was a large one hanging overhead in the middle of the platform, I think one of my pictures shows it, but there needs to be something on the actual wall where the binoculars are. It was the second stop on my DMZ/JSA tour after the Third Tunnel and worth the 20 minutes you’ll be there for."
Misty North Korea,From here you can see across to North Korea. If you pay for binoculars you can see details of the village.Unfortunately this day was a bit misty so it was difficult to see any details. But you can feel the history and imagine
View of North Korea,This was the third stop of our DMZ bus tour. There is a viewing platform with quite a number of binoculars for looking into North Korea. Binoculars cost 500 Won for 2 minutes. There is a gift shop on site. There is also an auditorium with a large relief map of the surrounding area.
An observation deck to catch a glimpse of North Korea,"This place sits on top a hill in the South Korean side of the DMZ and allows visitors to catch a glimpse into North Korea. You can also see the white DMZ line clearly.Quite an experience to be able to peer into North Korea, but there are just mostly trees. Most notable sights that you can view are the Propaganda Village, the DMZ line and the Kaesong industrial region.There is an observation deck for visitors but you will most likely have to fight for a spot near the wall as other visitors will scramble to take pictures of the view. You can also pay 500 won to use the binoculars to get a better view, but it didn't make much of a difference for us. Won't say it's a must visit, but it's a good experience to be able to have a view of the hermit kingdom. If you have to pick and choose places to visit in the DMZ, Dora Observatory need not be too high on your list. "
Living history... A human zoo,"An odd experience all around. No personal vehicles and no walking on the road is allowed in the DMZ (demilitarized zone), so you must be packed onto a tour bus and shuttled over. Tour guides like to keep it moving so don't be surprised if you only stay ten minutes. Bring lots of coins for the binoculars to see into North Korea, or even bring your own! Literally hundreds of tourists pack onto the viewing deck to observe North Korea. A refrain that is often heard is that it is like a human zoo. It is very odd"
An eerie glimpse into North Korea,"Standing at the Dora Observatory, a mere 1.1 miles from North Korean, your imagination runs wild as you stare in the distance. The border between South Korea and the demilitarized zone meanders below, and the actual border between North and South Korea halfway between those barbwire fences and a North Korean watch tower. And in the distance, using the coin binoculars or the zoom on any camera, you'll see the mysterious town of Kaesŏng, North Korea, gleaming on the horizon inside forbidden territory.This is the point on your tour where you gain the first glimpse into the hermit kingdom, starring at the undeveloped, overgrown DMZ prairie beneath you from a bird's eye view. This stop is not a 5-star attraction for me, because that rating is only reserved for the crown jewel on this journey, Panmunjom itself. But the Dora Observatory was the only locale from which we could truly see an extensive view of the North Korean landscape, their cities, and even their decoy town of Kijŏngdong. This is a worthy stop, but make sure your tour includes Panmunjom or your selling yourself short."
Insightful experience,"This is a really good trip to understand the historical factors underlying the history of the Korean Peninsula, and the extent of the historical animosity. "
Excellent Panorama of the DMZ,"Worth a 30-minute visit to have unobstructed views into North Korea. Be sure to pick out the two enormous, “competing” flags on either side of Military Demarcation Line (MDL) to the East. There’s also a giant statue of Kim Il Sung just to the North of the large North Korean flag."
Overlooking D M Z ,You can see here the north and south korean flags and the imaginary demarcation line that separates north and south korea territories. Today propaganda speakers are removed and hopefully korea can be as one nation again!
Brilliant!,What an amazing experience to take our kids to see North Korea. They have paid binoculars to see more clearly. A lovely Korean gave the kids some coins to see as we had no change. Love the flag pole story as well.
"Short stop. Bathroom, souvenir shop. We had poor visibility.","We had a short stop here. There is a bathroom and souvenier shop. Observation area to look out over the DMZ and to North Korea. 500krw to use the lens. Unfortunately, visibility was quite poor. In the auditorium, is a relief model of the area showing what’s there which gives you a better idea of the area. North Korea mountains have generally been denuded of trees to be used for firewood."
Amazing Observatory/Views,This was our first stop once inside the DMZ checkpoints. It was a decent day for visibility so we could see the North Korean flag and propaganda village across the border. inside the observatory contains a miniature model of the border lands which help put into perspective what you were looking out towards. It is quite an experience to come from a free country and be standing in a free country were you can pretty much go where ever you like and to see land that is basically forbidden to visit. It's amazing yet sombre at the same time.
Memorable,"Being able to stand and look at North Korea was chilling, fascinating and truly memorable. If the wind blows in the right direction you can hear the loudspeakers playing music and announcements. It’s mind boggling."
Keeping an eye on the north.,"The thrill is in the looking out on North Korea. Other than that nothing real exciting. They have pay/coin operated telescopic binoculars mounted on the walls out side. A vendor exchanges bills for coins. You have to hope it is a clear day or it is hard to get a good view. Remember, they are looking back at you!"
Honestly pretty cool,"There are several binoculars and a window to make change for them. You can see the villages along the DMZ; it's really neat. Inside the observatory is a model of the area you can view with the binocs, and there is also a long map above the binocs area. Beneath the observatory are relics from the Korean War."
First sight of North Korea,"This is an observatory where one can see North Korea, its roads, buildings, statues, and propaganda (fake) villages from afar. You can even hear the propaganda music that is being played from time to time. You can also look through binoculars a closer picture of the reclusive country."
A piece of living history,"It is amazing to me that as we live in a world with so much information readily available at our finger tips, that there is a place where the citizens still live in a state of oppression. Looking through the binoculars, you can see the homes and villages of North Korea. You can hear the propaganda as the South is broadcasting to the North how good life is over here, and at quiet moments you can hear the North doing the same to the South. Seeing the two enormous flag poles in the distance standing defiantly only a few hundred meters apart. What a sight. Hopefully will someday be resolved, and these sights and sounds will be in the past, but a great time to see them is now! Worth the trip."
Dora Observatory ,This Dora Observatory was included in my DMZ tour. There’s telescope that we can look to see North Korea. There was loud funky music and we can take a photo with North Korea at a distance in the background. 
Spying on North Korea........well kinda.,"Came here with a tour group. This was our first stop. Got off the bus very excited after an hours drive from downtown Seoul. Put a couple coins into these high power binoculars and then got a glimpse of North Korea and the ""Propaganda Village"". You can also see the North Korean flag flying in the village. Spoiler Alert..........came to learn later in the tour that no one actually lives in the village. But I still had fun anyways. Tips: There is a gift shop and you can buy items made in North Korea."
A view of DPRK,"Overly crowded as most tour buses stop at the same time. When you do get a chance to see the view and snap some shots, there is very little to see. The whole DMZ tour has some great history about the war, but this place has not been maintained and it is showing its age. Unless you are a history buff it is not worth the trip."
2nd favorite stop on the DMZ tour,The views from the observatory are second to none! You get to see clearly into North Korea and the binoculars you can use for 500 Won work pretty good!
Deceptive panoramic view of peace!,"It was just a brief stop at the Dora Observatory with the 180 degree view of the other side of the Demilitarized Zone (North Korea side). The vast agricultural land must be very fertile by now due to long years of inactive cultivation. If only both sides will agree to jointly cultivate the vast area of the Demilitarized Zone, their potential agricultural outputs can feed thousands if not millions of starving people of the world."
"Very cool, not much to do.",Still a cool spot along the DMZ/JSA tour but overall it's pushing through tourists just to put fifty cents into a set of binoculars and stare at the demilitarized zone. While it's very cool to see some of it from the observatory there's not much else to it other than a gift shop.
A glimpse of North Korea,"If you want to have a glimpse of North Korea, you can pay SKW 500 for binoculars and take a look of propaganda village or fake village, they said that no person is actually residing in that village.. You can also see North Korea's flag. "
Somewhere over there...,Loud blaring music is what I most remember from the observatory! And paying for telescopes to see if you can see anything on the other side! We wondered if there were people on the other side trying to see us! It's ok just to say you've done it!
A view into North Korea,This visit was part of the tour to the DMZ area and a nice place to visit. You were not allowed to take pictures from the wall.
"Starting point, dont waste money on the binoculars",A decent starting point and good place to stock up on snacks and food before venturing into the DMZ. The views from the top are not exceptional and you are better off waiting until you are in the DMZ properly.
Good visit,Educational visit. Could see as far as one can with the telescope. Enjoyed the trip. Took pictures with South Korean soldier. 
On a clear day you can see alot,But be aware that it is often cloudy and you can't see most interesting sights in the summer when the visibility is very limited. It would be nice to be able to see the Propaganda Village and massive North Korean flag but on the day we visited visibility was very limited.
"View of North Korea, the battle of the flag poles, and speakers playing music",We got here via our DMZ JSA tour. It was during a monsoon so our views sucked. We did see the giant North Korean flag pole in the fake city. Could not see much else due to the haze wish we had better weather
Quick Stop with Binoculars and Conference Room Maps,"We stopped here as part of our overall DMZ tour. To get here, you must get on a bus and go through a military check point. Passport is required. The driver tells you how much time you have to see everything but he says it in Korean so luckily for us we had an English guide with us. You get out and go to the binoculars to look at the propaganda town in the North. It is not easy to see through the binoculars as there are no adjustments. It does take coin to operate them. After that you can go into the conference room to view a large mockup of the DMZ of that area. I took pictures but noticed afterwards that I wasn't supposed to. Overall we saw more of the DMZ and the guard posts at the other DMZ site, and that was a private tour with a military escort. I would recommend that one over the Dora observatory. (To Travel Is To Live)"
Peek into the North,"If you wonder how the North is, lifestyle, landmarks, etc.. this is the place.You will get to view through the binoculars or viewers for a small sum. This will enable you to view the North rather well. You will get to see the two flags at opposite parts of the zone. And get to hear the working song played for the people working on the farms."
"Views of N. Korea, take 500 won coins for binocular machine!","I found this the most interesting part of the tour of the DMZ. Propaganda Village in North Korea is visible. There are binocular machines for 500 won but they only take coins so bring some! They do help see the North more clearly but you can always bring your own if you want a higher spec image. Lifetime experience, well worth a visit!"
Great vantage point ,This area provides a great vantage point for seeing the DMZ. There are binocular machine you can use for a very low price to get more close up views. 
So close to the north..,He we could see the morth and the propaganda village that is set up by the north..theres also many telescope available for you to see the propaganda village up close..
Here you see North Korea really quite clearly,Using the Telephoto Binoculars you can see the Fake Village as well as the Genuine 3rd Largest NK City. No idea why they built a fake one when one with 300000 people is also in sight. The South Koreans blast out K Pop music from here to North Korea. 
Shocking,There was a smog in North Korea so we didn't see a lot. There was a very loud broadcasting from both sides which underlined the whole atmosphere.
Important to see ,Important to be there. If you were in Korea and you didnt see the most political sight in Korea. That is the important place in the DMZ. 
A look at a closed world,We visited here as part of a tour {obligatory} No solo travellers. It is equipped with binoculars to see into the 2km no man's land but 100 Won a go and no change available. Really nothing to see except that you know what is beyond.
Good on a clear day,"Here you can look through telescopes to see North Korea. Unfortunately, it was foggy on the day of my visit, so the visibility was poor. They also offer a short 7 minutes program in several languages."
Cool to see into North Korea,This area is where you are on a high tower and can look into North Korea where they have a giant flag flying and loud speakers blasting their news to the people. You can pay to look in binoculars however with a strong camera save your money. 
I hope Korea can be one again?,We visited here and some other sights in the DMZ tour (including the JSA zone) in March'17. It's worth it! There are so much to take in and learn about who and what in the Korean war. I really hope Korea (north & south) can be as one again? And leave this hostile ugliness in the past! There is one of the North Korean spy tunnels to visit. Be prepared to walk down a small and steep tunnel at a 45 degree angle. The look out to North Korea you hear North Korean propaganda blasted from loud speakers from their side. Wow! The South Korean blast back K-pop! The view was hazy when we visited. The JSA was amazing experience in the UN blue room. Actually your in North Korea! ... The DMZ tour is a must!!
Great View!!,"Very good view of the North Korean ""propaganda villages"". You can here North Korean propaganda messages and music being played over a loud speaker in the distance. Definitely worth the visit!"
A Place for Reflection.,This is somewhere you can see that the divide between North and South Korea isn't a thing of the past. You can pay 500 won to get a closer view into North Korea. There is a room where you can see a model of North Korea (the are you can view from the observatory. Where you are in the room with the model listen to the solider you can't take photos there. We where there on a foggy day so we couldn't see that far away. You are also educating yourself about the Korean conflict from the South Koreas view.
Impressive!,Standing there makes you realize this whole North/South Korea thing is still very alive today and no child's play. You can peek into North Korea quite a bit and hear propaganda that is played through loudspeakers. You can also observe other tourists who make smiling selfies with soldiers as they were in front of the Eiffel Tower. That is an attraction by itself...
A place where you hope,"A place where you can take a trip during summer time. A place rich in the history on the Korean conflict. You can see the adjacent North Korean side (photography is strictly not allowed, as camera flashed might be mistaken as gun fire), a village and the 3rd tallest flagpole in the world. Technically both Koreas are still at war, but this place, you cannot help and feel that hopefully, the country will be in peace."
Observatory,You can see NorthKorean territory from here. Pretty notable the difference about both Koreas in just one landscape
See the DMZ and North Korea from afar,"On a sunny day with clear blue skies, you can get a panoramic view of the DMZ and look right into North Korea from afar. Unfortunately it was cloudy when I was there so I could not see as much. But still, the view was magnificent."
Amazing how N. Korea is very near!,"The view from here is amazing because you can visibly see (well in a very clear day) the boundaries between N. Korea, the DMZ and S. Korea. The flags of both countries are very obvious, the division of the land is very obvious. This is manned by soldiers so be aware of restrictions. "
"eerie, choreographed view of the north",the observatory offers view of the north that are hard to get elsewhere so worth doing. there is a change service for coins to operate the binoculars (worth doing). I found the whole thing eerie but fascinating - we treat the regime as something to poke fun at in the west but seeing people there made me re-think my desire to see it any closer. From the music pumped out the speakers to the uniformed inhabitants - worth a visit and time to think
See North Korea from afar,"You need 500 won to use the binoculars for a limited time only. From it, you will be able to see North Korea but you'll just see their big and tall flag, few villages and buildings. They said those are just fake villages though. You're lucky if you get to see a single person or group of people working. In our case, we weren't able to see any people. Worth a try just for the sake of experience."
An excellent view of the DMZ,I visited here as part of a tour. The briefing in the amphitheater is a must. The view is amazing. For 500 yuan you can use one of the attached binoculars and see it all up close. The briefing is first which sets up what you are looking at. Notice the North and South Korean flags and the nearby villages.
View of North Korea from South Korea,"This is an observation platform built in 1986. From this observatory in South Korea, you can see Gaeseong , the third largest city in North Korea. You can observe two flags, a propaganda village, the Gaeseong industrial complex and one of the statues of Kim il Sung. Of course, a clear sky is a prerequisite to see this view. You can see through binoculars after paying up 500 KRW."
Highlight of DMZ tour,Cool to be able to look over into North Korea and hear the music and verbal propaganda that is being blasted across the fields. 
A peak in North Korea,On the point you can look through binoculars (for a small fee) and see in rhe distance a city and factory in North Korea. If you know the history it is beautifull too see. 
Really nice spot,"It has a really nice view on the DMZ and the north and south korean village, I really recommend it to people. There goggles to see better, it costs 500 won (0.5 dollar approximately), we can have zoom on some spots."
The cold war lives on and we hope it will not get hot..,"This observation point looks right into North Korea. The ROK Lieutenant on duty was very helpful in explaining what we were looking at. You are not supposed to take pictures from the viewing points at the wall, as you might be in the sights of a North Korean sniper and there is still some shelling from time to time. As the DMZ is unpopulated it is getting grown up and a lot of it has reverted back to nature. The view from the observation point into the North shows a hazy bleak landscape with an abandoned factory complex on the horizon. This was built by a South Korean industrialist who was looking for a project that might be a step on the path to unification. The idea was to build a factory and have North Korea begin manufacturing goods for export and start to build some good will between the two sides. The goods were shipped to a large warehouse just below the DMZ and then shipped out for export. However, the regime in the North apparently used the profits for their nuclear weapons program and the South withdrew its support. While overlooking the DMZ you can hear loudspeakers broadcasting propaganda to the south. I asked one of the guards what they were saying and he said they were extolling the virtues of their illustrious leader and denigrating the leaders in the South!"
Military controlled view of North Korea,"There is a thick yellow line at the Dora Observation Platform, which is the closest place you can usually take photographs ""over the wall"". It is guarded by uniformed military, and they are usually very strict (according to our tour guide). Strangely, on the day we visited, we were permitted to take photographs from the wall - it was very foggy, but we saw some of North Korea. There are telescopes which you can use. Most of the buildings are ""fake"", made by the North Koreans to indicate wealth, such as one which is supposed to be a hotel (also according to our guide). You can see the flags of both North and South Korea, marking the territory. Such sadness that one country is split in two. Quite an eerie and disturbing place to visit."
Good view of inside the DMZ but not within it.,"Going inside the Joint Security Area (JSA) is a thrill. The rest of the DMZ tour attractions are not. The Dora Observatory has a good view of the DMZ and neighboring North Korea but it is not within the DMZ. If you can find a tour that is only the JSA, then take it.The other DMZ attractions are not within the DMZ. That said, the JSA is ""so worth it,"" having to do the other DMZ is okay.Please note that the United Nations has a dress code to enter the JSA in recognition of its importance and dignity."
I'm gonna see North Korea.....Or Not,"Dora gives you a great glimpse inside North Korea. On a clear day you can see miles into it, unfortunately it was so foggy I couldn't even see 20 feet in front of me. Might have to do this again on my next trip to Seoul."
Seeing the North Korea from top,"If you've never seen North Korea or been to North Korea. Come have a look from far. No camera is allowed beyond the yellow line. You can pay to use the binoculars. A perfectly clear day when I was there and I got to see the propaganda village, the bridge of no return clearly."
So close but so far,At the observatory it is a chance where one can actually see right into N. Korea giving you an experience that this is where it is all taking place.
