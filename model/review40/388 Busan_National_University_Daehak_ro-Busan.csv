Shops everywhere,You can find streets after streets of shops here. Plan for at least half to a full day son that you have time to wander around. Price seems to be lower than other parts of busan but I cannot be sure as my daughter suddenly fell ill here and we only had about half an hour worth of time here. Will try to come back again. There is a NC shopping centre just in front of the university which had a peculiar operating hours for the escalator (830 to 1400). Not sure why. 
"Great hangout, shopping, photos","Checked out Pusan university and it was a nice hang out place with lotsa young ppl, cosmetics, small quaint shops selling clothes, eye wear , cosmetics and a whole variety of cafes/ restaurants to choose from. NC dept store is at it's door step! highly recc!"
Good shopping and dinning area,"You can find NC shopping mall next to university, the price and goods also good value and you can do the Tax refun. Outside the university the Sandwich is very nice. "
Shopping like local,Good place for youngster hang around...not much tourists not so pack with people a lot of restaurant. Shopping is difficult because have a lot of small shops hiding behind some shoplot so this place look a bit messy and not really clean the street. If really want to shop you have to spent a lot of time walking around and search the items you want to buy.
Shopping time,A lot of young people go there for eating and shopping. these things sell cheaply there. Many dessert cafés. :)
Include this place for shopping,"This place is easily accessible by metro, just get off at Pusan National University station.My advice is to skip this place if you do not enjoy shopping. This place is quite similar to Ehwa Womans University, Seoul but a smaller version and less organized. We planned to buy some clothings, accessories for my daughter and left the place not disappointed. We included this place together with Seomyeon and Nampodong for our shopping.We had lunch in one of the many restaurants patronized by the students and the price is reasonable."
Great Finds ^^,"So many nice finds here in the streets of PNU especially for the young crowd. It is a great shopping and food district. The cost is affordable, good thing that their target market is the students. For people who likes anything cute like I do, this place is a heaven. There’s Artbox and across it is this shop (I forgot the name), similar to a DC mart but a 4 story building, full of cute Korean stuff (fluffy slippers, scrapbook materials and so much more). You can complete your Korean/Kpop look from top to bottom by going shopping to these streets. Most of the vendors/salespersons are young too plus they speak and understand English so it’s a big help.The thing that I love here is the food. Many restaurants as well but I never got to try them because I’m still full with all the street foods I ate ^^. Shawarma, nutella waffle, hotdogs, most of the food I missed most to eat plus some new to try.There’s this small BBQ place (I’m talking about typical BBQ on a stick, not Korean BBQ on grille) that sells pork and pork parts aside from the usual Korean BBQ in a stick which is chicken. So awesome.Even if you do not have any particular thing to buy, this place is nice to go to. Good thing I like noise, so the big crowd and busyness of the street doesn't bother me at all."
Young street,"There is nothing much to see around the U.The reason i give ""very good"" are the food here is ""Young"" style, and so the shopping style. Since i am quite in tight budget, but i still get some awesome stuff like clothes n bag in low price.....n i just like the food selling in front of the U. i observed what the student order n order a set for me too, is kind of silly but is fun for me, cause i can't read and speak Korean."
Busy Busy,This area is always busy. I enjoy watching the people. There are so many restaurants and places to shop.
Edae in Busan / Shibuya in Korea,The food and shopping are amazing in this area! A young environment! Just take the subway to Pusan University Station and exit at exit 1. You are just a step away from great shopping!
Go here only if you have time to spare,"You can skip this place if you're short of time. It's just another shopping street, favoring young students who are skinny and dont care much for quality of clothes. If you're looking for clothes to wear to work, you can forgo this place. Generally the cutting and free size nature of cheap Korean clothes are not suitable for non Asians. No fitting rooms for the shops here. But there are a few good Italian restaurants here that make nice pizzas n risotto."
"lots to do, but not as much as KNU",I got PNU and KNU confused the first time I was supposed to head to PNU (here) and you can mix it up with BNU as well--so be careful!
