Near DMZ,"This observatory building is just on top of the hill and can see the meeting of the two river of Korea Peninsula - Hangang River and Imjingang River. There are many telescopes for visitors to see the opposite of South Korea on what the North Koreans are doing. There is a short video for visitors to understand a bit of Korean history and why the unification aboutThere are two fences separating the two Koreas, and in between this DMZ there is no human being. the only things allow to move about are birds, fishes and animals."
Visit near to the DMZ border area,"Hi all,First time seeing real for myself about North Korea thru the telescope at the odusan museum which is just opposite of where I standing,U can see 2 soldiers marching but not a single civilians at the north Korea side so is good experience for mine children and me.Cheers Kelvin "
Great place to learn about the DMZ,As usual our Korean holiday was not planned before and neither was our trip to the border. We did it last minute and therefore chose to go to the observatory. Unlike Panmunjeom where you can only go with a group tour you can come here on your own. The drive from the hotel in Seoul took only one hour and so this is can be done easily in a half day. The observatory is very interesting and you can watch the north from several points. There is also a museum and you can watch a documentation about the north. Of course it is a bit one sided but you still get a lot of interesting information. Can only recommend this for people who do not have the time to do a full day tour.
