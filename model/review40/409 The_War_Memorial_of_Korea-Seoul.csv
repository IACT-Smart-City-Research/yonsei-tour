Enlightening Visit.,The tour was great. It was sad to see how many people died but happy to see the scene when the Korean flag was raised. Great history lesson.
great place to visit all free,"lots of people, but not crowdy , lot of exibition to see, lots of history, but all in very good condition, very clean.it will take you about 2 hours for your visit."
"Not crowded, nice leisure to learn about history of Korea ! ","The War Memorial of Korea ..... an educational history lesson. Have not visit museums for sometime, this stood out to be interesting and informative ! It is a beautiful place and definitely worth at least a couple of hours of your time in Seoul.... "
Well done museum,"As you walk towards the entrance, seeing the names of every soldier who died in the Korean War was a somber reminder of the price for freedom. The museum itself was well laid out and clean. Full of history and a good memorial.Would recommend."
Surprisingly well done,"I try to avoid war type memorials, but this one turned out to be probably the best museum in Seoul. Really good, mostly unbiased review of the wars on the Korean Peninsula. Enough english to keep it interesting. The art pieces were particularly well though out and you can't beat the price (free!). I'd argue this is a must visit while in Korea. "
Several hours well spent,I spent a rainy afternoon here by myself. I didn't spend too much time on the prehistoric history sections. Most of my time was spent on the second and third floors. It was very informative. I loved the interactive exhibits. I will definitely be back again.
A monument to one of Korea's darkest times ,Visit if you are even a bit interested in learning about Korean history and specially about the 1950-53 Korean War. It's a beautiful monument and surely worth a couple of hours of your time. I was surprised to learn that an Indian medical contingent was in Korea during the war and that the Indian flag flies along with the Korean flag and the flags of all the countries that played a role in the war. 
Don't miss this great place,An excellent place to visit. Well prepared information for tourists. The volunteers give you a very good guide in different languages. Lots to see and you can spend a whole afternoon there. A place likely missed by many tourists but is very worthwhile experience. Take the metro and walk for about 10 minutes.
Informative,"Great place to learn about the Japan-Korea war, I had very little knowledge before going. By the time I left, I learned a whole lot. Definitely visit if you have the time and you are in Itaewon area."
Outstanding attraction! ,"We visited as part of a Seoul city tour and wish we could have returned to spend more time here. Emjoyed the bronze statues outside as part of the plaza. Wonderful displays inside. The memorial hall caused me to reflect deeply on the toll of human life that was lost. We sat in on an interactive presentation in a theater where the seats moved and we were right in the nose cone of a bomber plane, right on the landing beach, right in the middle of an air fight... Oh, my, so realistic and well done. Don't miss this! "
Quiet and peaceful time at the memorial,"The memorial is easy to get to by train, and it is very quiet and not crowded with tourists. There are many things to read and objects of history to see in their museum. If you like to visit museums and read about their historical timeline, and visit quiet places, this place is good. We did not get to finish walking the whole place as it was closing soon. "
Heard it was a “must see”,"This is a very tastefully done audio visual explanation of the history of South and North Korea. The various rooms inform visitors of aspects of the war period and the U.N. and specifically, U. S.’s involvement.There is sufficient signage or videos for English-speaking visitors."
A great museum,An in depth look into the Korea war Dedicated at least a couple of hours as there are .any inrersting exhibits
Know More about the Korean War,A must place to visit if you want to know more about what happened before and during the Korean war. Quite moving displays and a lot of information given. All Allied countries who joined in this war (including the Philippines) are also honored in this museum.The military history of Korea is also displayed here.
Interesting,A wonderful museum that encompasses thousands of years.Very well done and very surprising that it was free.
Huge and free ,"The war memorial was a lot better than I thought, I wish I spent more time here to see all the floors and exhibitions. Reply well run and it’s free"
It's a War Museum,"I thought this was going to be a museum about the Korean War but I was wrong, it covers the history of warfare on the Korean Peninsula since like the dawn of time haha. There are displays of ancient arrowheads and things like that, as well as displays covering warfare in the area for the past thousand years etc. One of the better ""war theme"" musuems I've visited. It's very educational, and ""dense"", so not sure if it would be great for kids TBH. But historically important to understand what happened in Korea and why it is divided etc. I recommend this museum but only if you find the topic really interesting / enjoy history. There is also an outdoor area with planes and tanks and stuff."
Best attraction in Seoul by a mile,"This should be the top attraction in Seoul, an amazing museum with huge outdoor areas where you can board warships and get up close and personal to warplanes and tanks! A good place to understand Seoul’s history and the sacrifices made by many nations around the world. "
"Educational and interesting, South Korea is born.","Many may not know exactly how South Korea became the country it is today or why there is so much tension with North Korea but this will explain a lot. There is the usual displays of military hardware but there is a very informative section on the Korean War and how things got to be where they are today. Check ahead to find out if there are performances on the huge parade square that showcase Korea’s traditional and modern army, it is colourful and interesting to watch. South Korea is a proud nation and this is worth taking time to see."
Interesting ,"A good way to understand the awful war that has been forgotten by so many. 1,8m dead... a must see in Seoul "
Amazing museum - best to take in several kvisits,We have visited this museum several times. There is so much to take in that we see parts every time we visit Seoul. This year we focused on the Korean War. The outside area is an added bonus - and kids especially love it!
Memorial ,"English signs throughout. Lots of things to see and discussions of the War widely covered in an array of formats; written, video, display etc. "
Very interesting!,"Learned a lot about the Korean war and the UN's involvement. Fascinating. Then war planes, submarines, ships, and cannons displayed outside were awesome as well."
Amazing,One of the best museums I have ever been to. Very impressive and full of facts about Korea in general but the Korean War especially. Well worth it.
2 hours if solo,38th parallel means more with the museumthe flags reminded me of the unity behind any Olympics go thru the comparison between the north and south armaments before the u.n. intervened. massacres. surprise attacks. and the similarities with the Vietnam war. 
Strongly recommended,"Whether or not you are familiar with the several successive Korean tragedies of the 20th century, you should make a point of going to this museum and monument. It is made all the more moving by seeing the waves and waves of joyous schoolchildren of different ages as well as the young soldiers making their way through the exhibits. Chalk out at least 3 hours to do this place justice. "
Don't miss this!,"The exhibitions were interesting. They open until 10 pm every Tuesday. Don't miss the 4D show on 2nd floor. Very easy to come here, just take the sybway to Samgakji Station, Exit 12."
Amazing History,Plan to spend half a day to a full day or two to fully appreciate this Memorial /Museum. Unfortunately the tour I was on only allowed for a a couple of hours (completely insufficient). Well presented and poignant.
Great place to visit,A wonderful place to visit. It has a museum that is huge and an outside exhibits with airplanes and weapons from the Korean War
Informative,"A must see for military history buffs, take you through centuries of Korean history, with a entire floor and a half dedicated to Korean War. "
Brilliant Exhibition and Appropriate Remembrance,"The memorial monuments on the forecourt acknowledge the roles of other nations in securing freedom for Sth Korea and recognise that the Korean War was a struggle of brother against brother. The comparative size imagery of Sth Korean vs Nth Korean suggests more than just little and big brother.Outside there is also one of the best military machinery displays we’ve seen: tanks, planes (including a B52) and a ship.When you move inside the exhibits lead you through the chronology of the war with the use of static displays, maps, artefacts and audio/visual material. If you can’t get to the DMZ because of African Swine Fever, or any other reason, this is a good alternative."
An interesting museum.,"Certainly an interesting museum, could easily spend a couple of hours there. Free entry and rather easy to get to. Almost all of the exhibits had signs in English as well as Korean. Unfortunately on my visit some of both the inside and outside exhibits were closed to renovation"
Very Interesting,Our family of 4 spent several hours here looking at the displays and watching the short films. Moving and informative.
Half a day at least,"First visited with my 8 year old twins in Sep. Entrance is free. I truly enjoyed the complimentary English tour conducted by a lady in her 70s who lived through the war. Her stories we so captivating and touching I had to hold my tears in many occasions. We didn’t get to visit the Children’s Museum as it was fully booked but the kids spent more than an hour playing at the play area outside the Children’s museum. They were in awed with the fighter jets and tanks on display. Just visited the museum again today with my 15year old, our English guide today was a 17 year old high school boy. He was well versed with the basic history and professional with the job assigned. However, nothing beats having the story told by one who had first hand experience but it’s not fair to compare with the 17 year old as I think he did put effort to do his best. We spent 3 hours going through all the exhibits with a coffee break in between at the cafe on ground floor. They serve nice coffee, bun with red bean and cream filling and especially love their ciabatta sandwich with chicken and cheese filling. Will go back again for the Children’s museum. "
This is an amazing museum!,"This is not a war museum. This is the Korean War museum. It is beautiful and incredible. If you have a heart it will bring tears to your eyes. There are testaments to all of the countries that helped defend them from North Korea, China and Russia. It is a soulful and beautiful place. The names of every person who died defending South Korea are listed on etched marble, by country and state therein. There are also several galleries with information. it was a moving experience."
Not much english,"Good for an afternoon, loss to see and do. I though it would be a bit boring as really not into war stuff. I was pleasantly surprised, liked walking around all the aircrafts."
Great display,"We visited by subway to Namyeong Station exit 1.It is 200 metres away.There are war memorials and a collection of artillery,aircraft,and armour outside.We also enjoyed boarding the Naval vessel.The museum inside has video displays,photos and weapons.Both are free.Great for families."
Interesting history,Interesting War Memorial even I prefer some other time instead of the Korean War.But really organized and well presented and well served by busses and others public services.You can enjoy your visit.
Moving memorial for the Korean War,"Wonderful museum/memorial. An excellent place to learn about the Korean war. Plenty of English signs and English speaking guided tours. They have artifacts from Russia, North Korea, South Korea, and America from the Korean War. They have a wall in the front of the museum where they have posted plaques for each of the American states and listed all the Americans who died in the Korean War. Very moving. Fun fact - the museum has one of General MacArthur's corn cob pipes."
Interesting,"This was a really interesting visit, especially for someone like me who wasn't familiar with the situation in Korea prior to The Korean War. You could spend hours at this place as there's not only the indoor exhibition hall but stuff to see outdoor (eg memorial, planes/submarines). "
Brilliant ,"This is a superb museum/memorial.Thought provoking, interesting, an excellent place to learn about the struggles Korea has faced as a nation over the years.Plenty of English labelling and the also have English speaking guided tours if you want one.Free entry & a must see whilst you’re in Seoul."
Museum ,"Great day, some of the items were closed but it was still worth the visit. It's free! Lots to see. Very large spread area."
"Fantastic memorial, worth it for everyone","Definitely must make a trip to this memorial--my seven year old son loved looking around all of the exhibits, and we easily spent 2.5 hours here. A lot of rich history to be learned, and there are loads of translations in English, Chinese, and Japanese. Easy to get to, about a 5min walk from Samjaki Line 6 station. Every detail of this memorial has been thought out so well, and there are so many amazing places to see here. Free entry as well."
Amazing memorial,"A beautiful memorial to honor those who served in the Korean War. It gives awesome insight to what was happening in Korea as well as the world. This beautiful place honors those who deserve honor. Korea is a beautiful place with a sad history. We had a tour guide that said, ""We can't change our history, but we can change our future."" I was thankful for the opportunity to learn more about that history."
Interesting exhibition,"Interesting exhibition with a lot of detail in an imposing building. The 4D films are a bit contrived and cartoonish as are some of the rooms, but overall an interesting way to learn about the Korean War."
Well worth a visit,"This is a great place to understand the history of Korea, dating right back to 900BC! Entry is free. You can get here via Samjaki station and you enter on the South side.One full days itinerary could be:1. Was memorial2. National Museum of Korea3. Ichon Hangang riverside park4. Seoul national cemetery"
Incredible for Korean and 20th Century History Buffs,"My visit to The War Memorial of Korea was very insightful, as I was able to take in a lot of history of South Korea and the 20th century. It was an incredible overall experience."
Excellent museum with plenty in English.,"And it is free. Outside are plenty of airplanes, tanks, boats including one recently shot up by North Korea. But be sure to go inside to see the exhibits of not just the Korean war, but ancient warriors and ROK's participation in Vietnam."
Incredibly informative,This is a 3F museum with history inside and outside with the inside including history from the dawn of the korean people to the current day practically after the separation of the two Koreas. There is so much information I didnt see it all. Outside there are flags for each country that helped South Korea in the war against the communists and inside includes info on the communist allies China and Russia under stalin. The outdoor exhibits include old war vehicles and giant statues and reliefs of people / soldiers. I can't express what's really inside except that it is a really informative memorial/museum. Entry is free. Lockers provided and a cafe inside. 
Well Presented,"I have visited the War Memorial of Korea over the past several years and it seems to improve with each visit. The information is well presented and honors Soldiers from all nations that contributed to the war efforts. There are many floors/exhibitions to visit and it can be a bit much for just one visit - thankfully the museum is easily access from the metro (just off Samgaki Station - line 4 or 6, exit 10/12 or Namyeong Station - line 1, exit 1) and general admission is free. There is an outdoor exhibit for children and the interior is appropriate for all ages, may appeal more to older children. I would highly recommend a visit to put things in perspective during your visit to Korea."
Impressive!!! ,"Seoul has many state funded museums and forms the ones I've visited or know of, all are well presented. It seems little is spared to put on a hood, high quality show. The National War Museum is no different. It showcases her military history from the earliest period up to the Korean War. You'd be surprised that Korea is not the doormat people perceive. But a proud and sophicated nation. There are things on display that you would not expect and not mentioned in books elsewhere. I've seen pictures of the turtle boat, but to sea in person is a nice experience. Yes is a scaled replica, but it's still impressive. There is also the large outdoor display. With a number of Korean War period planes and tanks. Also other retired items of hardware. You'd have to pay good money to see this elsewhere, but all free in Seoul. There is a B52 bomber, which is smaller than I thought. At the time of my visit, done halls and the outdoor display was closed off for maintenance. There are plenty of toilets, most displays have English and I suppose the only let down is that the giftshop. You can spend a fair few hours here. "
Nice visit,"If you like war museums, this is the place for you. I learned a lot and was quite impressed with the gratitude expressed to the 21 nations that contributed troops or support. "
A Gem for History and Military Buffs,"Last fall, I timed my visit here to coincide with a free Honor Guard Ceremony that took place at 2 p.m. on Fridays between mid-October and the end of November. I found it fascinating to watch the military band, marchers in colorful attire and displays of military precision on the massive space in front of the memorial’s entrance. But I was even more absorbed later by the museum’s displays, both inside and outside .Focused mainly on the Korean War (1950-53), the three floors of rooms also include a look at Korea’s history of resisting foreign aggression, such as the defeat of a large Khitan army in 1019. The Korean War rooms take visitors from what led to the Southward invasion by North Korea to the Armistice and the role of the United Nations. Nicely curated, the rooms present the nation’s War history through objects, films and information boards, which have many details in English.The outside exhibits display memorials and statues, such as “The Brothers,” which is the symbol of the Korean War and symbolizes reconciliation, love and forgiveness. The big bronze depicts a true story of two brothers, one from the South and the other from the North, embracing after meeting on the battlefield. I found this piece to be extremely moving.On the East side of the complex, I was amazed by the overwhelming number of big items displayed, related to the Korean War. These include aircraft. such as a bomber and a helicopter, and armored vehicles. Visitors are invited to explore the artifacts, and I saw many taking advantage of the opportunity. The War Memorial is open from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., Tuesday through Sunday, and offers free admission. Subway lines 4 and 6 have a stop (Samgakji) nearby. Take Exit 12. If coming here in the spring or fall, when the Honor Guard Ceremony is held, consider checking on its schedule to include It in your visit."
A must see!,This museum is simply amazing. I could try and describe it but I simply won’t do it any justice. This is a must see for anyone visiting Korea. You won’t be disappointed!
Worth spending time,"A large number of war exhibits. Both modern and ancient ones. Loved the 4D experience. Such detailed explanations about the history of the Korean war and the course of the war. Makes us gain great respect for the Korean community. ""Freedom is not free"" for sure!"
Must see before DMZ visit,"Carefully architected with a beautiful garden. But most of all, it is an entertaining way to get a better understanding of the North/South Korea cease fire that continues from 1950 up until today.If you have no historical background or if you already know a lot, the setup and displays are intelligently crafted to cater for all type of audiences."
"Beautiful, touching, a must see","From the moment you walk into the building, you can feel the solemnity of the environment. The combination of minimalistic decorations sometimes contrasts with the sheer size of some of the exhibits; giving me always that feeling that peace is easy and simple, but only if we really make that great decision to make it our goal, instead of the side effect of overtaking others by force.I fell in love with South Korea, and this place had a good part in that."
Freedom is not free,"That’s the poignant catch phrase that sums up the general feel of the War memorial.There are indoor and outdoor exhibits that makes this old school museum a sight to behold. The exhibits are grouped into 2 main rooms - one from the north’s and one from the south’s perspectives. There are complimentary tours with a volunteer doyenne and I barely made it to the 2pm session with Chang (there’s one more at 10am) although there is plenty of English explanation and if you use the guided audio, you’d be in good stead! Chang brought life to our walk, particularly when he provided a glimpse to his life as a Korean War survivor (he was barely 3 then) and how his ancestral home was South according to the 38 Parallel but because of the DMZ, now belonged to the North, and he’s rendered homeless. If you know how much the Koreans repeat nay treasure their ancestral hometowns, you can almost hear his angst through his thick accented English.Yet his gratitude and humility shone through.All in all an educational tour. And a must see. Set aside 3-4 hours to go through the exhibits thoroughly! "
Engaging and honoring,"Large museum with engaging presentation of historical facts. Outdoor area has real military equipment, including planes, tanks and boats, some of which can be climbed on or in. Indoor area has multiple video displays or 4d movies, as well as standard plaques.A couple floors dedicated to the Korean war, while another floor has ancient war history, including a very cool scale replica of a turtle ship.Very tasteful and honoring memorial to fallen soldiers and overall great presentation of historical facts on the Korean war. I plan to come to this museum whenever I visit Seoul."
One of the best war museum ,This is the place where you will understand everything about the Korean war! Good English speaking guide! 
Not to be missed!,"We visited this with a South Korean friend, but missed the English tour - nevertheless, it's an absolute must-see for you to understand the recent history and current climate of this land. We would love to return and join the English tour, but lots of the signs and videos are in English, so I'm guessing we probably didn't miss too much information. Such a poignantly expressed display, we were deeply moved and touched by the depth of emotion behind the presentations. No spoilers, just make it a point to go and spend a few hours there - well worth your time!"
"A Distant Obligation, honourably discharged","Moving, sad and fascinating. Worth a half day visit if you're in Seoul. Closed on Monday's (we made that mistake first time)."
A Must Visit,This is a poignant reminder of what happened during the korean war. It is very big so allot some time to be able to appreciate this museum. At the back are old planes that were used and a boat where you can go up and take pictures. At the entrance of the museum are the flags of all the countries that helped them during the war and a short message of what their contribution is to the koreans. I like it that they write each message in English and in the native language of each country. A must see in when you visit Korea
Memorial Visit,If you have time to visit this museum you will learn so much about the history of the Wars in Korea. One of the best museums we have ever visited and well worth seeing. Allow at least a half a day or more to make sure you get to see all that the museum has on show.
History of the now Korea,This museum will teach you all you need to know about the war in Korea and the story behind North and south Korea. You should check it out if you have time for it. 
Much Cooler than you Imagined,"The history of the war is particularly interesting for a visitor from the US. Go, even if you think you won't enjoy it. It's a good experience and you'll know where you are in a more real way."
A Must See,"We got here late so we had very little time to peruse the grounds, but we did have time to see the memorial and find the names of our relatives. It is an amazing place and allows one to realize the full cost of the Korean War to all the countries that participated. I had no idea so many countries were involved. Note of caution: If you take the Hop On, Hop Off bus, they drop you have quite a distance from the entrance. That is why we were late. It's a long walk."
Tremendous,"The best military museum I’ve ever seen. Korea’s War Memorial has about 650,000 square-feet under roof, and more than 60 fixed-wing aircraft, choppers, tanks, artillery pieces, missiles, and naval vessels outside in the rain. You get a crash course in the history of Korean warfare from neolithic spear-fights to modern times: civil wars between ancient ethnic groups, invasions by the Chinese, Japanese, Mongols, Manchus and so on; the centuries-long Japanese pirate fleet threat; the 19th century attacks by various Western powers; all the way up to the Vietnam War, when more than a third of a million ROK troops supported Saigon.Most of these wars, battles, sieges, victories and defeats will be terra incognita to foreign visitors. But it’s all interesting and well-presented. Curatorship is outstanding. 21st century technology helps: if you see locals watching any animation on pirate fleets, city-wall sieges, et cetera, stop and watch the spectacle with them.Most military museums focus on generals and admirals, soldiers and sailors, strategy, tactics, and the various regiments or battleships involved in the fighting. The War Memorial goes beyond the fighting forces to also provide information about non-combatants. This is underscored before you even walk into the museum, in monumental statues of both soldiers and the victims of war (see The Warriors and The Victims photos). Not surprisingly, half the indoor area is focused on the 1950s Korean War. I walked in with a fair grasp of the military changes of fortune in that war: such as the North’s surprise attack, which captured Seoul within 48 hours. What I’d never known before was that not only did the Northerners carefully plan exactly how and when they’d attack, but they also carefully planned the sweeping atrocities they would inflict on the civilian population of Seoul as soon as they captured the city. If you were on their list, you and your family disappeared within 48 hours of takeover; thousands were on their list.The museum’s information on the war is sweeping. The commitments made to the North by Stalin and Mao prior to the attack, Douglas MacArthur’s determination to turn the tide with the Inchon landings against the opinion of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the massive winter counter-attack of Chinese forces, are all presented clearly and cogently. The Korean War is also unusual because of the ROK’s powerful ally: the United Nations fought on their side. There have been UN peace-keeping missions since, to the Balkans and other areas, but never again anything like this. Two dozen nations from Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia and both North and South America fought under the UN flag, to save the people and legitimate government of Korea. Several rooms of the museum focus on the UN decision, and the UN leadership of Trygve Lie. The museum notes that immediately upon hearing of the attack on the ROK, Lie called an emergency meeting of the Security Council for the next day, and the UN support for the ROK was proposed, argued, revised and passed the same day. The museum names the countries which supported the UN resolution, the one who abstained (Tito’s Yugoslavia), and the member state which was absent: the USSR. (It doesn’t mention one interesting bit: the USSR’s delegate was refusing to attend UN meetings over a totally different issue—the seating of the PRC—another partner in the attack. But had he attended, I believe the USSR could simply have vetoed the resolution, in which case the ROK wouldn’t have been defended under the UN banner, and the UN in all likelihood would have gone down the drain like the League of Nations.) At any rate, you get to see a diorama of Douglas MacArthur receiving the UN flag that they’d all be fighting under (see UN Flag photo). A large area of one floor provides information on every nation that sent military personnel to Korea, as well as every nation that sent medical personnel (some of India’s and Denmark’s noncombatant personnel also died in Korea). Each of these countries has a special area in the museum, where you can learn how they contributed, how long they were in Korea, where they fought, and how many died (see Thailand Display photo). The information for each country is in Korean, English, and that country’s national language: Greece’s in Greek; Colombia’s in Spanish, and so on. Since Belgium is bilingual, you can read or hear about Belgian forces in Korean, English, French or Nederlands. This United Nations aspect of the war is symbolized before you even enter the museum, by the national flags of the contributing states flying in a semi-circle around of the facade (see International Flags photo). Each of the national stories is interesting. Luxembourg’s infantrymen were integrated for the duration with the Belgians, and although the headcount of Luxembourg fighting forces was small, as a percentage of total national population, it was one of the highest of any of the countries. Turkey sent a brigade-size integrated unit of artillery, ordinance, engineering and transport, which inflicted ten times more enemy casualties that it received.In 1950, there were only three independent counties in sub-Saharan Africa; all three contributed. South Africa sent pilots. Liberia supported civilian relief. I thought Ethiopia’s story was the most amazing of all. Haile Selassie was a strong proponent of collective security; he’d appealed for support from the League of Nations when Mussolini invaded Ethiopia, and hadn’t gotten it. So he wanted Ethiopia to help Korea, another innocent country, but Ethiopia had no army. Solution: the Emperor sent his Palace Guards! The guardsmen weren’t trained for combat, so US instructors gave them a three-month crash course, and attached them to the US 7th Infantry Division. The Imperial Guard did just fine: the museum has videos of them marching upcountry where, among other battles, they fought at Pork Chop Hill. The museum also addresses the impact of the war on individual men and women of the allied nations. For example, an Aussie who left his pregnant wife to go to Korea, died there; his wife never remarried; more than half a century later her ashes were buried in the Korean grave of the husband she lost in her youth (see Mrs Shepherd photo). Another Australian widow, Nancy Hummerston, was buried at Korea’s UN Memorial Cemetery even more recently, in 2010, sixty years after Captain Hummerston died defending the ROK.I spent the best part of a day here, and could have spent longer had they not been closing. Among my favorite sights were:* A replica of an 500-year old dragon-bowed Korean battleship, reduced to frigate size so it would fit in the central courtyard, but still impressive (Battleship photo).* A grand gallery of military paintings around the walls of that courtyard, including Korea’s crushing defeat of a French invasion force sent by Napoleon III in 1866 (Kapkot-Jin photo; that same year Napoleon III’s army was also beaten by the Mexicans; figuring the odds of losing three in a row were negligible, the III-time loser then declared war on Prussia). * Korean “knights” using trident-spears rather than the lances of their European counterparts (see Trident Knight photo)* An ingenious ancient Korean contraption for rapid fire of multiple arrows (see Gatling Bow photo).* Something for the children, a miniature Korean castle they can climb onto to man the bastions (Hawseong Fortress photo)* A huge drum commemorating the 60th anniversary of the founding of the ROK armed forces (Mother of All War-Drums photo). * A modest little inflatable Aircat airboat used by the ROK for river and marsh reconnaisance in Vietnam, and equipped with A60 machine-guns. This beaut is outdoors with the other military hardware: big impressive fighters, bombers, heavy artillery and tanks, so the little fellow goes virtually unnoticed. But back home in south Louisiana, “Cajuns” down on the bayous use airboats to get around in the swamps, where they hunt alligators for gumbo. You could hunt any number and size of ‘gators you liked, if you had an A60 machine-gun on board! (ROK Aircat photo).* Also outdoors but much nearer the street, a 20-year-old exact replica of the tallest of all Korean monuments, a four-sided monster 6.39 meters high, inscribed with 1,770 Chinese calligraphs. The original still exists, but was carted off to China long ago, and isn’t likely to be returned anytime soon. An impressive placard informs us that “The monument of King Gwanggaeto the Great (391-413) was built by his son, King Jangsu (413-491) in 414 BC in Gungnaeseong, the capital city of Goguryeo,” to honor his father’s conquests and the founding of the kingdom. And in small print, we’re also advised that “The translation of the inscription was advised by experts in the relevant fields in 2005.” Apparently chronology wasn’t one of the “relevant fields” that anybody was an expert in, since 414 BC precedes 391-413 BC, rather than following it. Still, it’s an impressive replica of Korea’s grandest ancient monument. (Monumental Error photo)."
An Army Museum,It is in fact an army weapons and history museum. Very large and large rooms sometimes complicate to navigate. English. Interesting mini video shows. Nice courtyard.
Heroes,"We are Turks and we are proud of heroes that live with us forever. All the nations that are included in the war are seen with their names, flags and clothes. "
Impressive,"Visited here for two hours and I wish I’d been able to spend more time. Very impressive memorial with lots of displays covering centuries of conflict on the Korean Peninsula. Goes well back in time, not just focusing on the Korean War. Great displays everywhere. "
Highly Recommend,"I visited the War Museum of Korea with 3 teenagers in August 2019. They are not big fans of any museums or history related places, but they really spent good time there. It was not boring at all. The architecture of the War Museum itself is amazing and the display was quite excellent. There are plenty of videos, 3D participation, and good explanation in English. I highly recommend War Museum of Korea to anyone who visit Korea. "
Great museum and lots to see and learn,I learned a lot just this museum visit. Very well laid out and there is a great deal of information presented. Spent about 2.5 hours there and could have spent a few more.Very well designed museum and worth a visit if you're into history or just want to understand more about the evolution of Korea as a country in the past decade.
Impressive and interesting,"A beautiful, sad museum, which summarizes Korea's history of wars through the ages, including airplanes, tanks and weapons from the war of the Korea's in 1950. There are signs in English, a clear sense of order, and the place is very respectful of the sacrifices made."
Amazing museum but racist worker,"Very interesting museum but the wonderful visit were wasted by some racist worker. As we were waiting for the line for an animated room (incheon landing 4D simulation) with a 15 people capacity and 30minutes long waiting line between the sessions, the staff member who were in charge of the line had the audacity to put first 4 korean girls who came after us. Indeed, she went to talk to them then one of them started to give us some weird glances. Then when it was the time to enter the room the 4 Korean girls quickly took the 3D glaces and run in the entry. We were 3 and she came to us at the end to give us the glaces but only 2 remained...when we told her that we were there before and we were going in together she went to give the glaces to the people behind us. We tried to complain but she brushed us off and completely ignored us. Even though we stayed very polite we were really disappointed by this unfair experience."
The memorial complex and the military Museum are very interesting!,"It will be interesting for those who are interested in the history of Korea. Very informative! Many rooms with exhibits, there is a real combat equipment Equipped area for watching documentaries about the war in Korea."
Visit to Seoul ,War memorial is perfect place to closely learn about history and sacrifice of Korean people It also shows countries who stood by and against Korea Very nice building and perfect place must visit 
Amazing Modern Museum,"This museum was included in our Seoul City Tour company's tour of N Seoul Tower, Hanok Village and Korean War Memorial. This museum is a Traveler's Choice Award museum and it does deserve this. This is a huge modern multi media museum that was free to go into.I concentrated on the section that covered the Korean War. I did not understand this war before going to this museum but I do understand why it happened now. I wish that I would have had more time to spend on this museum because they had other indoor displays and lots of outdoor sights as well. 1 1/2 hours was just not enough time."
Thing you have to see!,Very educational.on work day wasn’t crowded.loved everything especially outside!lots of pics and fun!
Educational museum,"On a rainy day museum was crowded, noisy kids running around. Worth to visit still, I learned a lot of Korean war history and felt nice how they remembered for example all UN partners in Korean war. Intresting how they linked modern technology with paintings and sculptures."
A must see if you are visiting Seoul.,This is a must-see if you are visiting Seoul. Especially if you are interested in military history. It takes you through all the military conflicts involving South Korea.
The war memorial of Korea.,"A huge memorial location with many exhibits to view.Easily a half day tour. Food in the attached restaurant was good and reasonably priced,Well worth a visit."
Exceptional Museum! ,"Honestly one of the best Museums I have been too! Well spaced out, clean and taken care of. You can feel the respect for their history in the information and atmosphere you see and feel. No charge but donations welcome. Free English speaking tour at 10am & 1pm, we unfortunately missed those but I have no doubt they would be great. English signage and leaflets all round, shows/videos and 4D available in English. Toilets on every level and so fresh and clean. The best bit for us was the children’s museum, fantastic interactive areas free of charge for a set 50min. There is a playground outside for the children to burn off energy and a few cafe to get snacks and ice cream, also blox (Lego) area which looked great but we didn’t use. "
Outstanding Museum & History of Korea,"Sadly, Korea's history has been marred with warfare over the centuries. But this museum is a great collection of this history with artifacts, interactive displays, and panoramas that take the visitor to some of these battles. Also interesting to note are some of displays on the modern ROK military which is one of the strongest in the world. The vastness of the museums reminds me of the Museum of the Great Patriotic War (WWII) in Moscow. "
"Great museum, educational and fun. ","Wasn’t too sure what to expect from this museum, but upon arrival we were blown away by how massive the place is. The museum was really large inside and out, with lots of exhibits to look at, interactive ones as well. A lot of in depth rich history and there’s even free English/Japanese walking tours (12pm and 2pm I believe). The admission to the museum is free and there’s 3 massive levels for you to experience. "
Educational experiance,Was great to learn so much about the Korean war and the struggle the KoreN people had to go through after that to become who they are right now. 
Best war memorial and museum,"Huge collection, spanning early Korean history to most recent conflict in the Gulf. As expected, there is a significant focus on the Korean War, but there is much, much more. The outdoor exhibits are extensive, including a B52D from the Vietnam War. The memorials are particularly meaningful and well done. There are many interactive exhibits, and plenty of English signage. This is easily a half-day visit, especially if you are interested in military conflict and Korean history. Provides great imsight to military history on the Korean Peninsula. Free entry. Easily the best war museum and memorial I have visited."
Don't Miss This,My family of eight visited Seoul in June 2019. We had never been to Korea before and didn't know quite what to expect. We chose the War Memorial because of our interest in history and the Korean War specifically. We weren't disappointed. The museum is well laid out and there is enough English that if you don't take the tour - which we did and recommend - you can still understand things.The tour guide had very good English and was very helpful. I liked that they paid credit to all the countries who sent soldiers to help them preserve their country when they were invaded.I am really glad we had the opportunity to see this amazing museum. 
Huge and full,"We were here a half day and did not nearly see it all. We started with the outside area first coming upon the Clock Tower of Peace and then the Statue of Brothers. From there we visited all the outdoor sights and particularly the Open-air Exhibition Area. On a warm May day I really did not want to leave but there are very few places to sit and take a break and with standing, reading, and observing a nice short bench break would have been welcomed. The first floor held a very interesting up to date exhibit (which may have been a special exhibit) about recent relations with North Korea. Admission is free. Be sure to grab a free brochure as it will help you plan your time at the museum."
Understand the Korean history of conflict,"We spent a half day in the museum. We were with our 20+ year old sons. Shortly after arriving, we drifted apart and did not see each other for a few hours. We all found things that captivated our interest. Lots to see and learn. Very well done displays and explanations. "
surprisingly extensive display,"I was not expecting much about this place, but was surprised to see the indoor and outdoor displays. They have a lot of tanks, artillery, fighter jets, and even a huge air force B52 bomber on display. There is also the coast guard cutter that still contains all the holes during the gun fight it had with the north koreans. Even if the AV presentation was in Korean, it provides a detailed blow by blow on the firefight.Very well kept and maintained, which showcases how nationalistic the country is.Well worth a visit even for non Koreans who are history or war buffs."
Insightful in several ways,"The museum provides a well illustrated history of the painful Korean war. You leave the museum a lot wiser than you arrived. Certainly in terms of the events of the war, but perhaps more interesting, you have a much better sense of the pain and deep wounds this meaningless war has had on the people of Korean. Clearly the history and culture of Korean is deeply affected by the divide and you feel you understand this a little better after the visit. If you are interested in military equipment this is definitely also a good place to visit. "
"The War Memorial Museum, Seoul","Excellent, very educational place to visit. Free admission. Be prepared to spend about 3 hours there. It is about 5 to 10 minutes from the subway station. The signage at the subway station exit is not so clear though, can certainly be improved. The museum is huge. At the lawn outside, there are exhibits of planes and a replica of a submarine. Inside the museum there are lots of war relics and artifacts along with informational/educational descriptions.Poignant/touching/chilling moments for me: (1) the Statue of Brothers, depicting 2 brothers hugging each other, who fought for the opposite sides (as South Korea vs. North Korea soldiers); (2) the inscribed near the main entrance that said “if you want peace, remember war”; (3) strolling through the Memorial Hall honoring the Korean war soldiers. In the UN soldiers section, names of USA soldiers far outnumbered those of other countries. It said that is a copy of the Washington DC’s Korean War Memorial. I don’t quite remember if I saw that during my DC visit, so those who have recollections of both places can perhaps comment."
Heartbreaking and educational,"We visited the War Memorial of Korea today. It was my second visit and it is well worth the time to explore. The building and grounds are beautiful and full of war relics. From prehistoric weapons, displays from different eras in Korean history to the high-tech displays to Admiral sun-shin's turtle ship- it is all here impressively displayed. Admission is by donation. The only suggestion that I would make is to have the address written in hangul on website (for the cab drivers). Be prepared to spend hours here. It's worth it."
Interesting to visit,"Attempting to find one's way from the subway stations can be challenging since the signnage is very poor (exit 12 from Line 6 is the easiest, line 4 more difficult). The memorial itself, however, is well presented and I am sure it would be much more interesting to those with a military background."
Good way to learn some Korean history...,"The area is big and there is a lot to see and learn. No entrance fee and you can learn a lot from the exhibit as there are a lot of things to see, hear, and experience. Suggest to put this in your agenda when visiting ROK."
Interesting and Serene,"There is a Memorial Hall for those who have passed from service in various Wars of Korea. Also there are military vehicles such as planes, ship, tanks and others where you can take photos or get a closer look. Within there are exhibits for the various wars Korea was involved in from early history to current. On Fridays, at 2 p.m. there is an exhibition of the various military branches in the front of the museum. This is where you experience the all female Color Guard, traditional martial arts, the various anthems of the military branches, and many other performances by the various military branches. Make sure to sit outside by one as they start to practice so you get a good spot to sit on the steps. Also, there is no charge for this Museum."
Very Moving and interesting,A total look at Korea at war from early time through Japanese imperial invasions to present day. Well worth the visit.
An Optional choice,"As war museums go this was all the encompassing for the Korean Peninsula. Korean friends back home stressed that we must see this. Well, there is a fair bit of jingoism here and I can see why Koreans feel strongly about it. If stressed for time, this is a miss."
Amazing place ,If you plan on coming here then don’t be rushed! There is so much to see.We had to plan well as we were on a time limit.We visited the rooms about the Korean War which were really informative and interesting. The English is just fine. They have rooms on further back in history which we didn’t have time to visit.Absolutely huge building. There’s a cafe selling nice smoothies and a gift shop on sight. Outside is amazing too - loads of fighter planes and tanks and of course the super impressive war memorial statue.What a great place to be free as well.
Well Worth the Visit,"This place not only documents the Korean war, but also pays tribute to all the nations that sent their sons to fight for the Korean people. Very moving. "
A great way to learn about the Korean War,"For most of us who are uninitiated about the Korean War, you mostly think of it as a US war like Vietnam. However the War Memorial of Korea really open your eyes that it involved the UN and China.The museum doesn't just focus on the Korean war - it highlights how Korea fought in wars during the ancient days, and its involvement in modern day conflicts. I joined a free guided tour in the morning. Although the tour guide's English was quite accented, he was very enthusiastic about what he was talking about."
Detailed View of Korean War History,"Initially I thought this museum would just be focused on the Korean War but it went into a lot more details on other historical battles waged by long ago Kings.Outside there were a number of memorial statues as well as a large assortment of aircraft, rockets and fighting vehicles that you could get up close to and peer inside. A number of the armored personnel carriers were open but you could not go in. Sets of stairs were brought next to a cobra helicopter so you could see inside the cockpit. The PKM357 ship from the 2002 Battle of Yeonpyeong is displayed here with red paint detailing every area damaged during the battle. This was the only display where you were allowed to climb onboard and see the bridge, deck and guns up close and learn more about the battle that killed South Korean seamen.As I walked up to the entrance, there were a number of black pillars dedicated to the UN and other countries that came to South Korea's defense during the Korean War. In addition along the walkways to the side of the main entrance were large plaques with all of the names of soldiers from around the world who died in the war. It was a lot of recognition and honor.Once I entered the museum, it turned out to be a lot larger than I anticipated. The bottom floor contained details about each kingdom’s armies and battles and went into size, arms, skills and success. In the central courtyard were wooden replicas of early Korean warships. The top two floors went into extensive review of the Korean War with 4D movies, dioramas and artifacts. Additional planes, limosines and arms were also displayed.Unfortunately I ran out of time but one could easily spend 2-3 hours here."
Moving and a reminder of the tragedy of war,"The outside memorials are, in my opinion, the best part of the whole thing. The statues and installations are very moving and well designed. Inside the Korean War exhibits are very well put together, and take you through each year of the war, the help received by various countries and the contexts of the war. My only critique would be that they seem to microscopically criticize the north in every facet, while never accepting or elaborating on any of the shortcomings the south may have had. In brief, a broader and less biased history would have helped to understand the nuances of the war a little bit more. The memorial is free! Which is awesome for budget travelers. Near the entrance you can find huge walls with all the names of the victims from each respective country that died in the Korean War, so that was also very special. It's nice to see the recognition showed by Korea to every country that tried to help them. If you're interested there are also war machines out in the front of the memorial with vehicles such as tanks and a big war ship."
"Interesting museum, a bit dull","When you're interested in Korean history, this museum is a must visit. However, I found it a bit dull. The information was presented very simple, without any 'extra's.'I think I expected more information about the course of the war. The information could have been presented way more interactive, or with some items to go with it."
The Beauty of War,A beautiful interactive display of history that gives you opportunity to understand the importance of what it means to fight for your freedom. War is scary but this gives the opportunity to be guided through history to understand the changes and development of people during the sone of worst decades in world history. To see war bring together the most unlikely and war torn countries together to fight for the freedom of others and rebuilding of others. It’s an amazing.
Great,"Very nice to visit if you want to learn about South Korea's history. Lots of military plane, tanks, etc. to see and take pictures here."
An excellent half day--or a day if you are really into this conflict.,"We came after lunch to the War Memorial. It has excellent programs that explain the war and the international coalition that brought the North Korean-Russian-Chinese forces to armistice. There are lots of details for those who love details and it is easy to choose what to focus on and what to pass on. There is lots of English interpretation, unlike some other museums in Korea, and many beautiful sculptural tributes to the many soldiers who gave their lives. Korea lost just over 170,000 soldiers and God knows how many civilians. Just over 10,000 Americans died. There is no entry fee, there are a number of good video programs and there is a coffee shop if you suffer from museum eyes after a while. For Americans especially I think this is a good way to understand something of the very special bond that exists between Koreans and Americans. One thing it could do better is to illustrate the cultural rifts between North and South that existed for centuries before the conflict. This dividing line is not just a creature of the Cold War. Coming during the week would be a good idea. We were there on a Thursday afternoon and found plentiful parking. I'd certainly go again."
Multimedia Narrative History and Artifacts,"Great, free, museum about conflict on and over the Korean peninsula from ancient to modern times. I spent 2.5 hours here and still didn't see, read everything. A wonderful mix of multi-media (movies, actual US/ROK and captured equipment, wax museum like staging, and other artifacts. If I get back, I would visit again and review from current 3rd floor to ancient times 1st floor. Save some time for outdoor equipment."
Great make time for it,It's huge and they have put in a massive amount of time and money.If you are interested in this kind of stuff allow a full day. If not spend an hour or two and see what you want.Probably the most informative museum in the area and its all free.
So much to see ,There is a lot to see at this museum there are old tanks and aircraft and more on the outside and inside There is no fee to this museum and it can easily take a day to see everything They give you a lot of historical information on Korea and the US and it is near Yongsan US military base that will be closing soon so I made visiting both of them a day trip
"Impressive, moving and just a little unsettling","As I had some free time left in Seoul, the War Memorial seemed a good place to visit as a follow-up to visiting the DMZ. Although I'm not really interested in military history, I found an impressive and informative range of displays on the history of war on the Korean Peninsula and an expression of hope for the future. To be honest, I found it all a little unsettling, but it's very well presented and there is an area for kids to learn the history. There's also a wide-ranging display of military aircraft, tanks, missiles, etc, that you can get up close to. Worth a visit, even if military history isn't your thing. Free entry."
A Must for Military Buffs,"I visited this as a last minute decision, heard the announcement on the hop-on-hop-off bus and figured I would check it out. It turned out to be a good decision. The museum is very modern and well organized with a lot more exhibits than I ever expected.There are 3 floors inside with exhibits from the Korean conflict as well as details of the Korean Military's contributions to other endeavours such as the Vietnam Conflict. Very well done.The thing that really impressed me was the outdoor exhibit with US, ROK, and Soviet weapons many of which I hadn't seen before. It is quite a size and includes a B-52 and an entire Patrol Gunboat. As a final touch many of the tanks are surrounded by lovely flowers which somehow seems appropriate for a hope for peace.There was no admission charge."
Gotta go,Fantastic museum. Well worth a visit. You need a few hours to have a good look. Very easy to get to on the subway. 
Informative,Spent a few hours at the large free memorial. Amazing collection of items from the war. The largest I have ever seen at a single museum on the war. Provides detailed history of the conflict between North and South Korea.
Very Moving,A wonderful memorial to those who were lost in the “forgotten” and continuing war. This memorial gives you a feeling for the losses suffered by the Korean military and civilian population which escapes Mose Americans. A Highly recommended stop.
Amazing place,This is quite amazing. Its free and it tells the story of war through the ages. there are lots to look at and many movies explaining the history of the Korean empire. It tells every aspect of the story even the peace keeping aspect of the Korean military. I was very moved by the memorials outside the museum thanking the different nations helping the people of South Korea.
Shocking ,"Well....it definitely IS a WAR museum. I found it simply obnoxious. We were led into a movie play which encountered me to be more like a counter strike video game. It was a 4d movie! Sitting there and watching the invasion of Incheon through a soldiers eye.... ok.... not my idea of a „war museum“(that is supposed to be dealing with the terror of war)..... but when these soldiers started to fire at their own -but north- korean people I was just simply shocked. I have never ever seen such an impiety before. It all reached its peak when some american tourists wanted to start clapping at the end of the „show“. But they wouldn’t dare to as we all looked shocked and pissed and wouldn’t want to clap. The rest of this museum is ok but it rarely displays the terror of war, it even more glorifies it. It took me a few days to get rid of this disgusted feeling when I left the museum. It’s more like US Propaganda."
Interesting,Spent the morning there and it's a must to see. It's wonderfully kept for you to wander around and take in the past. It brings it home to you what South Korea went through and how many countries were involved. It also reminds you that it was one of the poorest countries after the war and how far it has come now.
Memorial & museum - The Forgotten War,"A stunning circular memorial plaza, surrounded by black marble plaques detailing all the names of the ROK dead. The museum details the geo-political background and build up to the war in 1950. Too much to mention, good exhibits all detailed in Korean and English. Lots of hardware outside and inside. Worth a morning or an afternoon. Free entry."
Worth a visit to learn about the war that essentially transformed Korean society,"Very well done war museum that tells the story of all of the wars Korea has faced in its history. But for Western visitors, it's sufficient to focus here solely on the exhibition dedicated to the Korean War. It's a great place to learn about the war that essentially brought the Republic of Korea to where it is today. Definitely worth a short visit."
Understanding how Koreans fought for their country.,"It was the first time I saw war weapons, aircraft, war ship and tankers used during the war. Very informative visit."
Fantastic learning for free,"I visited this museum and spent good 5+ hours touring around. They have exhaustive materials on war history, literally from the very beginning. The Korean war materials were very sobering as well as educational. Make sure the check outside yard for their extensive collection of war equipments!"
Quite impressive,Originally we did not plant to visit the musem but we were happy that we decided otherwise. We leaned quie a lot about the so called forgotten war and the museum is a good mix of information and memorials. Also the outside part with an actual B52 bomber is worthwhile
Extensive museum of the history of war in Korea,"This is a massive museum providing information about wars and military strategy throughout the history of Korea (and, now, South Korea). While an English Language tour was provided, it started out focusing intensely (in terms of time invested) on the ""Korean War"" (which I suppose is what most English speakers want to know about). We were hoping for more of an overview of the museum, so we left the group early. It took us 2 hours to see the entire museum quickly. All signage is in English. "
a very moving experience,"this memorial park and cemetery is beautiful and very moving. we learned alot in the little museum there about the Korean War, also a beautiful park"
WOW!,"Excellent museum - It's part memorial part museum.While there is always some sombre moments visiting a war memorial, I found this one to be very well designed and tourist friendly. It tells the story with easy to follow layout and exhibitions.Highly recommended to anyone with an interest in war in general or the Korean war in particular.You could run through in an hour but I'd recommend at least a few hours to take it all in."
Awesome....awesome....awesome!,"This was my highlight in my trip to SEOUL. Fantastic military equipments on the outside and very informative musseum on the inside. Btw, admission is free. "
"Excellent museum, worth a visit!","An excellent museum to learn about Korea. Great exhibits and storytelling. Entrance is free and you can download an audio guide when you get there using their free Wi-Fi. There's some focus on wars, but lots of general history as well. Explains a lot about why the country is the way it is. Would highly recommend for people who enjoy history."
As Deep as You Want to Go,"Covers everything from thousands of years ago to the present conflict, with a surprising amount of depth in any area. Would be good for kids or especially for adults."
That's why South Korea,"I visited with my friend from Australia. He didn't have any knowledge of South Korea. I thought this place just explain about weapon or flight of war something ... I have been there, but I didn't remember well. And I knew I was totally wrong. we had 5 hour there but it was not enough time for see there. Long Long time ago Korea had war and war again a lot too many time. so if you know the war of Korea you will know about Korea history, nationality, geography ... it was my best part of trip. don't think too much Just go there and see about Korea. Never disappointed you !"
Very Interesting Museum,The museum is quite big it will easily take 4-5 hours to go thru all. So we joined a hour guided tour. Very good. Now we understand more about the history and how the Korean people were suffering. Is a MUST if you wanted to know the history how north and South Korea were seperated. We spent about 3 hours there but still didn’t manage to see all. It is free why not! 
COOL and it's FREE,"One of the great things about the museum's in Seoul is that most of them are free to include the war Memorial. It's easy accessible by metro, it's huge with great visual history on the inside and has a large park on the outside. It's one of the best museums that I've been to. It's worth putting on the calendar for a visit."
Worth a visit!,"Really glad I spent a few hours at the War Memorial. So moving. There are free tours in English (one in morning (10?) and 2pm. Many audio visuals to make it interesting, and worth visiting the outside just to see the monuments. Bonus--beautiful cherry trees in the area."
Good rainy day programme,Before heading to the DMZ pay a visit to this museum. You need to understand the histoty of this torn country.
Worth spending up to 2 hours here,"This monumental building is indeed a monument or memorial, and does not include a lot of guns and other military hardware. This contrasts with the Australian War Memorial in Canberra, which despite its name, is mostly filled with the machinery of war. More English lsnguage captions would be useful"
Very impressice,"I’ve been to many number of war memorials and military museums: this takes the cake. Huge collection of both Western and Soviet vehicles (tanks and aircraft) outside.The inside of the war memorial is touching, and appropriately conveys the loss of life in the Korean War.It is also one of the few governments attractions that is free. A must."
Full of history!,We stumbled upon this on a rainy afternoon when looking for something to do in the area. We arrived late afternoon to find it filled with School children but they soon left. The outside was filled with war vechicles such as tanks and planes and you can easily wander between them getting very close. The inside was spacious and set out nicely. There are lots of war rooms telling the complete history of Korea and war history. Everything is written in English as well and all the films have an English option. We couldn’t believe the musuem was free! Thoroughly impressed and educated now.
"Great museum, must see & free! No costs!","Great museum, lots of cool exhibits. Great service and very tourist friendly. Free & no cost which is great. Must visit if you come to Seoul! Learned lots about all the wars Korea was in and Korean history! :)"
Well worth a visit. ,The outside has a large number of exhibits including a huge B-52 bomber. Inside it gives the history of the war and even my youngest child found it interesting and moving. 
Well worth the visit,"One not to be missed, you could spend a whole day here, Well laid out and flow through the different areas. Tell the whole story of the Korean Military and wars. Lots of exhibits to see, emotional in places. "
"Displays, content and presentation are superb","This is a must-stop for any visit to Seoul. The organization of exhibits and content makes for a powerful and moving presentation. You could spend an entire day, but schedule at least 2 hours."
Amazing Museum,This was a wonderful museum to visit. The tributes to the Korean wars was thorough and well-done. We spent half a day at the museum and only saw about half the museum. I highly recommend!
The best museum I've ever been to,"I loved this museum. It was beautiful, emotional, and respectful. I felt so empowered and in love with the Korean people after visiting."
Great history!!,"I’m a huge of General history, so this place hit the spot. And it’s free! There are warring vehicles outside the museum and a little bit more inside. The place is massively huge and it may take a full day to finish the entire place. There are a couple of 4d theaters with limited seatings with scheduled times, make sure u get to each theater a bit earlier to save a seat! The exhibits covers history of the early AD, as well as the Korean War. There are videos, documents, pictures, artifacts, theaters. Definitely learned a great deal about Korean history!"
Amazing tribute to the Korean wars,This is a must see if in Seoul. The museum was very artfully done and told the history of war in Korea. I am not a fan of war museums but this one was amazing. I loved all the different visual effects and felt they did a wonderful job of recognizing the refugees of the wars and especially the section that acknowledged and thanked all the countries involved and lives lost in the North/South Korean War. Such an interesting display. 
Free entry daily (except Monday) to a meaningful museum,"For history buffs like myself, you should set aside at least half a day for this sprawling war memorial and museum. The outdoor section includes symbolic monuments, planes, tanks, and a 4-D video exhibit about heroic South Korean sailors which made me tear with emotion. The indoor section has 3 levels which you should start from the bottom. It starts from the evolving of Korea from even B.C. times all the way post-Korean War - that's literally two thousand years of warring history. There are plenty of exhibits and videos and 4-D experiences. My fiancée and I walked away with a deeper appreciation of the sacrifices of so many, and the realization that ""Freedom is not free""."
Great place to gain perspective of warfare on Korean peninsula ,"This museum is great place to gain a good perspective on the history of warfare on the Korean peninsula as well as the Republic of Korea's involvement in warfare elsewhere (Vietnam, etc.). The museum often has guided tours and offers self-paced tours with recorded explanations in a variety of languages available for use. The museum is large and exhibits are extensive so you should allot no less than 2-3 hours to do the place justice. I was there a half day and still sort of rushed through a couple of areas. This museum is only a couple of subway stops from the Korean National Museum so you could easily spend an entire day experiencing these two museums."
History ,"Beautiful grounds and building. Outdoor full of planes, tanks etc. For children and adults to climb. The museum is one of the best I’ve been to. Must see !"
Historical,"There are many beautiful museums in the world - this is how it will end up in one of the most interesting - as always in this area it gives rise to a lot of sad emotions and thoughts but such places are very important for people not to make the same mistakes! A beautiful, sad place that can show a piece of history to a man"
Very interesting ,"What can you say about war memorials? It’s a memorial, not a museum. It’s a must visit, but we didn’t stay more than an hour. Wouldn’t visit again, but would recommend to friends. "
One of the best museums I've ever visited,"Definitely worth visiting! One of the best museums I've ever visited. Very informative, amazingly done, and all of that for free! "
"The War Memorial of Korea, Seoul, S. Korea.","While in Seoul, South Korea, I had the opportunity, and yes I consider it to have been a real honor, to visit three of the Korean War memorials here in the greater Seoul Metro Area. My visits provided me with some valuable insights into the Korean War that began on June the 25th 1950.Two of the memorials that I visited were the UN FORCES FIRST BATTLE MEMORIAL located in Osan and THE MEMORIAL HALL OF THE INCHEON LANDING OPERATION located in Incheon.The War Memorial of Korea here in Seoul is easily, far-and-away, the largest of the three Korean War memorials that I have seen and visited while in Seoul. It is absolutely enormous. To do it justice, a visit would take a full day and even that would be a push. I feel that I saw perhaps 40% of it and that was accomplished during two separate visits that were several days apart.Which leads me to this comment : IF you are handicapped and have difficulty walking, you may want to take the size of The War Memorial of Korea into consideration. IF you have a wheel chair you will be in great shape. IF not, there are ample places to sit and to rest. There can be no question that IF you have an interest in the Korean War, this is an absolute must-see attraction."
Deeply Moving,"The outside is just as good as the inside. Powerful sculptures, a massive amount of relics, flags and number served from each country, wall of remembrance. Inside is also great, but if you were on a tight schedule, you could easily walk the outside and grasp the depth of emotions still felt by all Koreans. My family was very glad we visited this museum."
A must see in Seoul,I lived in Seoul for five years and visited the Memorial several times and went on the narrated tour. The tour was great. Don't worry if you don't speak Korean the tour is given in multiple languages. It gives a real insight of the Korean War and the suffering the Koreans endured and how numerous country stepped up and defended South Korea and fought along side their army.
Very Interesting,This was on our to do list for our one day excursion to Seoul and it was definitely worth the time. It is a tribute to those who fought and died during the Korean war.
War Memorial,The museum is located in Yongsan-dong. The exhibit contains the military history of Korea. It has indoor and outdoor displays. It was built to commemorate the sacrifice of patriotic martyrs during the Korean war.
"Fascinating, extensive war museum in Seoul","I heard about this museum from a fellow American staying at my hotel, and I'm so glad I was able to visit it during my time in Seoul. The history of the Korean War is tragic and complicated, and the museum does a great job at explaining what happened and how it continues to reverberate. The ground of the museum are also huge with airplanes, tanks, and weapons from the era. A must-see for any history buff."
You need half day for this one,It will take you 4-5 hrs to tour this big museum and see the rich history of Korean War. Restaurants and other food establishments are few meters away. Bring small snacks just in case.
Best and Knowledgeable Experience,"This place is located near to National Museum of Korea. No entry fee which is the best thing.This is one of the best war museum I've ever visited. Lot of informative stuff, 4D movies for experience. You get to see actual stuff used in Korean war. A must visit place."
Extensive exhibits,"This is an excellent war museum and memorial. If you must choose, this museum is much more interesting than the National Museum of Korea. The exhibits are thorough and updated; overall much larger than I expected. Plan to spend several hours exploring and learning about this important era. "
Very informative museum,"I went the day after Chinese New Year, but it was closed, so I was able to go for a couple hours before my flight home. The museum was very informative and provided a great insight into the history and how the war started and the role of the UN forces. Upon entering, I was greeted by what turned out to be an English speaking guide. He was very informative, but I had to part and rush through the remaining exhibits to catch my flight out. Otherwise, I'd probably spend another couple hours there. Highly recommended."
So much to learn and appreciate!!,"It was nice. I feel like I went back in time. You can see how war affected people then, and still today. So many lives were lost, and I feel nostalgic going here. The layouts of the sections of the history were easy to navigate. I like how the rooms connected to each other. It was free entrance, and you can spend a whole day here. "
A very good place to learn history,"A very good place to learn about war in Korea. But the downside is that since the visual is kind of real and they make the wax image and all, it can be kind of depressing once you visited the museum. But still it really worth visiting~!"
An extremely interesting museum for those interested by Korean history,"The museum is quite huge. It is split in many parts, with one part focused on the World War II. The museum is entirely translated in English, and there's various documents and items that are available to see. "
Very nice and informative war memorial,"As a person without that much knowledge and detail about the Korean War since it is not taught in schools here, this place was great. It is not only informative but it is presented in such a way that it makes you want to learn while still presenting the truths and horrors of wars in general. I'd definitely recommend this place"
Arguably...,"...the best historical museum in the world. Certainly the best one I’ve been to. Epic!!! If you’re like me and want to study and read most of the displays in a museum, you’ll need at least a whole day here. For some reason, I especially liked the ones on Korean participation in the Vietnam War. Somehow, the curator was able to put past the horrors of war and honor the soldiers and citizens of Korea. I was fascinated the whole time I was here which was much longer than planned. If I have any criticism of this place, a more nuanced perspective in North Korea’s participation is needed. The displays of wars prior to the partition of the country remind us they are an integral part of the Korean story."
A thing to see on your list,If you have any interest in the war between North and South then it is worth the visit. We have a belief that when we visit any country it is great to try and visit as many places that hold interest. 
War Air planes,We found this by chance after our lunch at Itaewon. We decide to take a slow walk from Itaewon to Namdaemon and come across this place.Interesting to see collections of war air planes and other vehicles store at one open space. We had great time reading through the information guide.FREEDOM IS NOT FREE
"Huge museum, very nice","Probably best to visit this museum a few times to give all the exhibitions the time they deserve. If you are into Korean history, be sure to visit this place. Also good to get background information about historical sites you might visit. (Like Hwaseong fortess in Suwon)The Korean War Memorial is beautiful. "
Amazing!,Its free entrance and very easy to find. We went there on a monday sadly you cant board the gun boat. But you will find more amazing war machine aside from that. 
The History Lesson is Invaluable,Take time to view all of the static displays outside and the amazing displays inside. We spent three hours here and could have stayed the entire day. This museum is a must visit for everyone coming to Seoul. It is very well done.
Informative about a war Westerners may forget.,"Visited on 12/1/2019 after a tour of the DMZ in the morning. The Korean War is a conflict that doesn't get much attention in the West, perhaps being forgotten due to its proximity to WW2. This free museum has English translations and is spread across three floors. It goes into detail about the history of Korea and then the origins of the Korean War and the aftermath. At the moment there is also an exhibition about the relationship between SK and the US, as it has reached its 65th anniversary. A very interesting place to spend an afternoon, definitely recommended for anyone who's interested in post-WW2 history."
Amazing place,"Growing up in former Yugoslavia and going through war in the '90 visiting this museum was very emotional for me. I was planning to stay there for 2 hours max and in the end I stayed 5 hours! Definitely a must to visit and to learn more about what ideology can do to one group of people! My prayers are with brave Korean people and I hope that situation on Korean península will be resolved in future. No entrance fee and even if there was one I would pay it gladly. Visit, visit, visit! "
You will find a detailed explanation of Korean War history throughout the museum,"Very good museum to visit, mainly focusing on Korean War history. It is located in Yongsan-gu, Seoul. Entry is free. The war memorial building has many exhibition rooms and an outdoor exhibition centre. There are nice displays of planes, tanks, and other military equipment. You will find a detailed explanation of Korean War history throughout the museum."
The Best War Memorial in the World,"I'm not joking when I say that. This place doubles as both a military museum with dozens of exhibit tanks, helicopters, aircraft and ships that make military history nerds like myself giggle with glee, and a grand, sombre memorial to the events that literally shaped the founding of the nation. The exhibits chronicle Korea's history of invasion by foreign states, its drive for self-determination, and its fight to survive against its northern neighbour in the Korean War of 1950-53. The exhibits make many boasts of how the nation must be strong to ensure its safety, but they never stray anywhere near nationalist or jingoistic themes. If anything, they serve to underscore the true destruction that war brings, and that whilst it is never wrong to fight for the right cause, the experience of war itself is something that should never be venerated or glorified.I spent almost 3 hours here - one completely lost in the maze of the vehicle yard outside, and the other 2 in the gargantuan memorial building itself. It was easy to navigate, and although admission was free, I made a donation at the end of my visit because of how immensely impressed I was with the experience. If you're in Seoul and want to get a better understanding of South Korea's recent history, this is something you cannot miss."
Awesome place to learn about the Korean war,"This museum is very modern, visual an incredibly informative. Unfortunately, as a Hungarian citizen, we don't learn much about Korean history so I am very glad that I have visited The War Memorial. I didn't know much about the place, so when I planned my day, I only dedicated one hour to this Museum. Needless to say, as I got lost in this enormous history lesson, I actually used up 3 and a half hours. Very thankful for this experience, I am looking forward to visit it again with some friends or family members."
Best Museum in Seoul,"The outdoor military vehicles such as tanker, missile launcher, aircraft and naval vessel were simply amazing. The indoor display of armoury was interesting as well. We spent almost 2 hours touring this free entry museum. Would have spent more time if we were not in a hurry. "
Covers more than the Korean war,"Before visiting, I had the impression it mainly focused on the Korean War. Although that is true, it also has other exhibits that covers history of Korea back to the older empire which was really educational as well."
Very Informative,Large museum on Korean War presented from Korean point of view. Generally positive and contains a lot of information which will satisfy history buffs. Worth visiting especially since there is no admisson.
Powerful and moving,What a great way to spend the day learning more about Korea! Totally worth the trip. We loved taking our time exploring the museum. Very well done--each and every room is wonderful!
Interesting experience,"Enjoyed our visit here. The outdoor area had lots of planes and tanks, and the museum and information inside was great. Good place fo families or those with an interest in Korean War history. Free to enter. "
Trip in Seoul,"Visited when I did a trip around Seoul, there is many things to see in Seoul but I wanted to see this and did"
Very cool place,We have been here a few times and our small children never want to leave. There are plenty of photo opportunities!
Highly educational and engaging,"Large volume of indoor and outdoor exhibits showcasing different era of the Korean military warfare, particular focus on the recent Korean war. Impressive, solemn honour of the fallen at the entrance. Highly recommended for those who would like to learn more about this unfinished war. Plan to spend at least half a day."
This place is a definite “must visit” if you are keen to understand the Korean War,"We visited this place of interest on a Saturday afternoon, and was surprised it was not crowded at all. We spent some time looking at the tanks, airplanes and ship that were somehow involved in the war.Then we moved to the museum inside. The exhibits were well thought out and well organised. There must be a lot of planning that went into the building and arranging the exhibits. Our regret was that we did not arrive earlier as we had to rush through the museum.This place is a definite “must visit” if you are keen to understand the Korean War, and do allocate sufficient time to explore the museum and watch the various documentaries. "
Incredibly moving memorial,"I'm glad I made the time to visit the War Memorial of Korea - it's a beautiful and incredibly moving center. I was fortunate the memorial was not crowded, so I was able to take my time browsing the artifacts and reading more about the events that took place before, during, and after the war. The candlelit memorial hall and ""peace tree"" were particularly memorable. "
War Memorial is Amazing,"Such a beautiful memorial to those lost in the Korean War and a history of all of the other wars they have endured. We were able to see the name of a Soldier who was from my small Ontario town who was killed in the Korean War. The sculptures are stunning as is the Rotunda and outdoor area. Magnificant display of planes , bombs etc. A must see."
Children’s Museum & Outdoor Activities,"We went here to go to the museum with our 3 and 5 year old but we just spent over an hour reading all the signs and talking about each aircraft, it’s purpose and the vehicles and their purpose. My kids were absolutely fascinated with them. There were several they were able to go up to via stairs or into via ramp. They loved the high speed vessel though our youngest got scared in the pilot house when the recording came on. Then after visiting all the airplanes and vehicles we found a children’s museum next to and at the war memorial. It was like a children’s war museum. It used sensory (touch, see and feel) to teach them about the war. Then there was a play area and coffee shop at the end but you are limited to 2 hours before they make you leave the museum. Coffee shop was good too. "
impressive with the warships and aircraft,good place to visit with kids. the extensive exhibits of aircraft and tanks used during wartime. internal exhibition a little bit boring though.
Understand why there are two Koreas!,"PROS:* Excellent presentation of the history why there are two Koreas* Proud of the United States' contribution. Understood America's involvement spurred because of not wanting to support the spread of communism and socialism.* Beautiful museum.CONS:* Was a bit hard to find from the bus stop. Google Maps did not bring us to the front and we had to walk around. The guard helped us find the front entrance.* No cons of the museum. Immersive, interactive and educational."
Must Visit Great Museum,At first I taught that it just like a normally boring museum. But its not...its a great museum to learn about the war of Korea. The outdoor itself so attractive with so many planes and ships. Indoor also good place to learn more about what occurred during the war in Korea. Not regret visited the War Memorial of Korea. Everyone enjoy the place.
Wonderful museum inside and out,"The displays are very well done and every country that participated in the Korean War is presented and honoured.Outside of the museum includes several tanks, airplanes etc used during the war. Give yourself a couple of hours to thoroughly cover. Note it is closed on Monday. Easy to reach by subway. "
"Amazing, beautiful, and educational","The grounds of of the museum are huge and beautiful. You can see Seoul Tower from the outside exhibits. Very educational in an interesting and intriguing way. All information available in english. fascinating exhibits. Best to go on a day that it isn't raining so you can enjoy the exhibits that are outside. Suggested time spent here, 2+ hours"
Learning about the Korean War,Good alternative in addition to other tourist spots in Seoul. There is an outdoor area which holds memorial monuments and also display various tanks and planes that were used in the war. Great place to learn about the history of the Korean War. Be sure to visit the 4D simulator to get a glimpse of what it was like during the war.
Definitely worth a visit,"The outdoor memorial has the famous Korean War monument and the Two Brothers monument. But make sure to stop inside the museum as well, which is free. The museum shows the history of all of Korea's wars. It also has a good souvenir shop with some books in English on Korean culture and history."
Must visit place,A solemn place to visit for those interested in happenings of the Korean war. Good history lesson and a solemn reminder that the price of freedom is not free.
Great history lesson,"I thought before I walked in that this would focus solely on the Korean War as we know it in the US, but it is a complete timeline of Korea’s tumultuous past. It is a free exhibit and there is a lot to see so give yourself a couple of hours. Most of the exhibits have text in multiple languages explaining the display. There is a lot of history on this peninsula and this does a great job of portraying that. "
Cannot miss this place if you go to Seoul ,"Definitely worth the visit, went there on my last day (today) after reading so many good reviews, and I totally agree with them. It is a Free entrance Museum, so there are no excuses not to visit, you can learn and see so much about the country. You spend about 2-4 hours in the museum or even more, I spent 3 hours because the museum was closing (18h00), but could have been there a little more."
English guided tour,Very interesting museum. The Tour was perfect. Lot of new information about the war with lots of items on display. 
A chance to see real war planes and vehicles,The outside houses tanks and aircrafts. Inside the building it talks about the different conflicts and the weapons used. If your into war history go and take a look! 
Such an educational experience!,I really enjoyed the War Memorial because it covered the various wars and not just the Korean War. It included all wars where Koreas were involved and it has been done very respectfully. Definitely worth a visit if you're in Seoul. The outdoor exhibition on all the planes is also amazing. 
One of the best museum I've visited,"We visites the museum with young children (6 and 9), all of us enjoyed with both indoor and outdoor displays. There are a lot of interactive information board, usage or technology to showcase, and most importantly, at least 98% of the exhibits have English explanation. "
Freedom is Not Free,"Excellent learning about the Korean War in 1950 and how the UN coliation came over to help fight this war. For everyone that didn't go through WW2, this museum is a reminder about how destructive war is on humanity and that we must not go to war ever again. Expect to spend at least 2-4 hours going through the indoor exhibits and the outdoor aeroplanes, helicopters, tanks and boat that were used in the war. Freedom is not free because everyone loses in a war. Many other notable quotes on the walls of the mesuem. Do not miss this museum when in Seoul. "
Surprisingly good ,"This makes the Imperial War Museum in London look like crap! There is every type of military vehicle imaginable on display in the grounds and you can climb all over them. In the museum, there are separate exhibits for children and the history of Korea is shown through its various invasions and conquests. Interesting and well presented with plenty of interaction most of which is in English, Mandarin and Japanese. The memorial itself is beautiful and moving. Well worth a visit even if you are not a military enthusiast. "
Very interesting Museum ,"This museum should be on your travel list, if you have a few days.It gives you a very detailed overview about the history of Korea with a focus on the wars it fought.The key focus is of course on the Korean War and it gave us a lot of new insights and a clear understanding of it.The museum is free and you should take at least 2-3 hours time when you plan to visit it."
Korea War Memorial,"Interesting museum with a lot of information and military equipment used in real life inside. Museum has both closed and open spaces. Open space is an exhibition of many military planes, boats, weapons and vehicles. It is better to visit on such a day that weather conditions allow to stay outside long time."
Very moving and inspirational,"This museum is a must, you must go and see the history of Korean war. It is so in details and exhibitions are well done."
Must visit for history buffs ,"The museum grounds are huge. Think similar to the US Congress. The museum has wonderful exhibits that span 2 millenniums of war history on 3 floors. There are war planes, tanks et al outside as well. Admission is free. One could spend an entire day in the museum in a casual stroll and still not cover it all. I would recommend reviewing a museum pamphlet (available in multiple languages) and choosing the exhibits that most appeal to you and go from there. You can also get a recorded guide headset at the entrance. "
Nice museum,Very nice museum and Memorial. Large airplane venue with all Korean War airplanes and jets used during war. Had a nice live military march display and plenty of war history. Would go back if ever in Seoul again.
A must see for history buffs,Very interesting to see how Korea views it's military and relationships with other countries. There was a military parade going on during our visit. It was in honor of the Veterans.
wonderful inteactive modern musum,Worth every minute. Gives real feeling of this not justified war that caused many many casualties of Korean civilians and American soldiers. Many interactive activities. Good organization. Monument very impressive. A Seoul must to my opinion
You shold go,"The Korean war is very important in the contemporan history of Korea, we went to the english guided tour done by a guide who had some souvenirs from the period. weapons, tanks, ships military plans.. A place to visit in seoul"
A must see,"A free museum which offers plenty to see. It highlights the Korean War Outside with tributes to the flags serving under the U.N. Inside there is a lot on the history of Korea. Lots of planes, tanks etc outside to take photos of."
Best thing in Seoul,"If you only had enough time to do one thing in Seoul, this should be it. We found this place unexpectedly moving. It does have the most massive display of military equipment I have ever seen in one place, but the overarching theme is one of gratitude to every country that helped South Korea in this war, and also that war is a horrible thing. A lot of displays focused on the impact this war had on families of all countries. The museum covers military artifacts and uniforms all the way back to prehistoric times, which was a bonus. This museum is very well thought out and again, pays great respect to all countries involved in the war. There are hands on displays for kids (mini castle to walk around in, many military vehicles can be boarded). Several films are available on demand to be seen in several languages, including English. Very impressive museum, and I don't give that compliment lightly. Don't miss. Admission free. Cafeteria and gift shop."
Not terrible exciting,I think everyone has to go here once. It's one of those things you do as a tourist. Some of the sights are cool but overall it does not compare to other international cities.
Great Museum,"Lots of old aircrafts, tanks and a war ship. They did great on remembering the heroes who fought in this war. The plan was to stay an hour but took us 2 hours. Time flies when one is enjoying. The best museum I’ve been to yet."
Beautiful and interesting,"The memorials are spectacular as was the military school display that was taking place when we arrived at 10am. You can easily spend hours walking around the tanks, planes and other military artifacts in the park."
it’s ok,well I am not really interested but went there because I had too ... but it’s ok ... what do you expect ? sad past ... 
English friendly exhibits about Korean War,"Easily accessed by metro Samgakjiyeok. Entrance is free. Site maps in major languages and guided tour in foreign languages available. Large building but simple layout easy to navigate. I went to exhibition rooms concerning the Korean War. I found them well laid out, adequate English and Chinese translations. Videos were English subtitled only. Only thing lacking is details of human suffering. Exhibits of military hardware was impressive and one can even touch a B-52 bomber! In addition to F-86, P-51, F-4,F-5, MIG15 and 19. There are many tanks too from both sides. A must for anyone into military history. "
A good place for history,"The place is huge both inside and outside. The hall gives honor to all The wars in Korea since The earlier years OF its history. The place was nicely organized and prepared. IT covers all the era from The 4th century onwards. There are exhibits, video presentations and actual War machines inside and outside. The outside has exhibits from The Korean wars OF tanks, planes, Rockets and artillery. A must place to visit in Seoul."
You learn something new everyday,"Before I went here i didn't know much about the Korean war but now I know quite a bit , even better it's free to visit"
Korea war HISTORY,"Korea war memorial, This place is like a one stop center for every information about Korean wars and countries that stood by then during the wars. VICE NICE PLACE, I recommend this place for those people interested in Korean history. you can also visit with friends and family as they display airplane tanks and many war instruments.The Place would show you background about the war, it was really fun place to be. for me I can visit as many time as I want to. very interesting placeyou can visit with your camera"
Must visit,"It is a must see attraction if you are visiting South Korea. Full of rich history on Korean war, world war II etc. One of the best war memorial I have ever visited."
Nice place!!,I really enjoyed it. If you are interested in the history of the war I suggest to visit the place which is well organized and completely free.
Free attraction,"Yes, its free. If you really interest in history please pay a visit here. This is one of the best ""free"" museum i ever visit. Very technology orientated and you can take some photo with plane, helicopter, ......."
Korean War Overview,We visited this site as part of our detailed study of leadership of the Korean War. Well worth the trip educationally and historically
Absolutely must see museum,"We recommend this museum to all of our friends who visit us in Korea. It has so much information about the Korean war as well as a huge range of military tanks, planes and even a boat outside. It's great for the whole family, although the kids did get a bit bored inside. The building is vast and so beautifully set out, that even just walking around it is interesting."
Excellent museum,The War Memorial of Korea is well done. It has something to hold the interest of all age levels.We were impressed.Admission is free.Be sure to take the English brochure at the counter.
Wow,"Great museum. Numerous old aircraft , tanks and vehicles. Along with a tone of information on the conflict. Very nicely done Memorial wall as well. Very Solemn "
Very Interesting,Especially enjoyed the section regarding the Korean War. I wish I had done a little research about other Wars as I didn't realize Korea has been involved with so many wars in the past.
Best part may be the planes outside,It's free inside and out. Nice tribute to the UN nations. Decent collection of artillery and other war gear.
Interesting,Take your time at this place. There is so much to see. Outside and in. It takes you through Korean war history for ancient to present. 
beautiful museum,I didn't look at pics or read reviews prior to going and was pleasantly surprised by the detailed history lesson that was presented. I spent many hours here. Thoroughly enjoyable if not sobering.
War Memorial,Great museum to learn about the war of Korea. Had outdoor and indoor exhibits to visit with planes and ships. Good place to go to learn more about what occurred during the war. 
A fascinating insight into the Korean War,"As history enthusiasts we visit a lot of museums and this one was well worth the trip. It is easily accessible from the Samgakji metro station.The museum is beautifully designed and set out, and the exhibitions are informative and thought provoking. All the signage boards are in English. I particularly enjoyed the large outdoor sculptures, monuments and the war vehicles area which includes aircraft, armoured vehicles and a warship, some of which you can go aboard. You could easily spend a couple of hours here. There is a cafe and a museum shop in the building. "
Best attraction in Seoul,"We spent a week in Seoul, and I would rate the War Memorial my favorite attraction. South Korea really went all out on this -- no expense was spared! I have been to other world-class war museums such as the War Museum in London and the Artillery Museum in St Petersburg, Russia -- but Seoul's War Memorial tops them all.Before one enters the main complex of the Memorial, one passes through an immense park packed with military hardware and statues.There are several floors within the museum -- which is free, by the way. There are several theaters that display either holograms or 3-D presentations. My favorite was a theater that was cooled down to about 2 degrees C with snow on the ground. The narrator of the 3-D presentation is a Korean war veteran who relates that one of the most difficult aspects of the mountainous warfare was the temperature factor -- and to reenforce this snow is blown into your face. It is clear that the Korean War is remembered to this day in South Korea with great vividity, and the museum emphasizes Korea's commitment to UN peace-keeping operations. The present-day tense situation with North Korea is refected in exhibitions within the museum, to emphasize that the horrors of the last war could manifest themselves again.The first floor of the museum boasts full-scale replicas of ancient Korean warships, and depictions of Korean's earlier war history in Asia."
Must see,Very education and entertaining. I learned a new thing or two. You can go in the vehicles and planes. Go a bit early because it gets crowded. 
Interesting monument,"The memorial is worth a visit if you have a couple of hours. The exhibits are interesting.There is a section on the armor used in the wor such as Russian tanks, a MIG 15, and other military weapons, There is a Cadillac Limousine gifted by President Eisenhower to the South Korean people.Free admiision. Clean rest room facilities and a small cafe are available."
Over crowded meuseum,Got to this war memorial as early as possible because it gets filled with crowds and children. I which there was also more control since many people were climbing statues with clear warning.Overall it was interesting to learn about the south korean perspective on korean war
A Must Do in Seoul !!,Its probably the best war memorial I have ever visited in any city or country. The eye for detail is exceptional with a huge collection of war memories including a World War II fighter jet ! Highly recommended and dont miss this place if you are in Seoul.
A day in the memorial,"I tought I would stay just a couple of hours here, but ended up been there for the whole day. There is a lot to see and to learn"
Really moving visit,"This is arguably one of the best war memorials in the world, there are memorials for every country, and service person who lost their lives during the Korean War. My favourite display was the 3D theatre showing the history of the Korean War which is told from the perspective of an old man, who’s statue sits in the front row. It’s haunting, particularly given how close they are again to the brink of war. "
Amazing!!!,War Memorial of Korea is very cool. My brother and I spend 2 hours taking pictures around of the memorial. The display shown inside the memorial is amazing. Alot of culture and history of war times if you are interested with the history of Korea.
site seeing,"this one of the attraction to see in Seoul, worth the visit, get yourself familiar with the metro so it will be easy for you to get around."
Good to get insights into the Korean history,The museum has no fee and has the whole history of Korea represented. It gives for an foreigner and good inside into the Korean history from the countries perspective.Plan minimum half day as it has a lot to see!
Moved my heart....,"This War Memorial is just amazing. We spent 4 hours here, taking in all the history of the terrible Korean War. Outside exhibits of military aircraft and tanks is very well done and the statue of the Brothers is just so heart wrenching it will have you gripped. This is such a well put together experience you will leave there certainly more clued up on a war that frankly, we knew very little about and the uk sent over 81,000 troops there!! "
Interesting museum,"This was the first place we visited when we arrived in Seoul as it was just a 10 minutes walk from where we were staying. Because we arrived late, we rushed through the exhibits but we were taken aback by the incredible history it documents. It should be specially interesting for children. The multimedia use is quite effective and at places you might need to pause. We came back from there wanting to learn more about the history of South and North conflict, and Japanese occupation."
Went just to have a look and nearly spent the entire day,"I found the whole Memorial to be absolutely incredible. It's huge too, think how much time you want to give to it. It's not just the Korean War but all the conflict that Korea has had throughout its history right up to the present. When I went through the international recognition (specifically Australian) section of the Korean War room I found myself getting quite emotional."
Nice place to visit,"I would recommend for those that are into warfares, this is the place to go. We enjoyed it and will take you a few hours to walk and learnt about the history of the Korean War and the wars before. We thoroughly enjoyed it but like I said, only for those into army, warfares, soldiers etc. If not, it will be a boring visit."
Wonderfully curated museum,"This is a huge museum that goes through Korea’s military history from the Middle Ages until modern times. Outside there is a large area to check out airplanes, tanks, helicopters, and even a ship. "
Interesting afternoon,"I spent an afternoon wandering around between the tanks, planes and boats outside and through the muesum its self. They had alot of interesting things. I would however recommend going with a guide."
Nice morning out!,"Don’t need too long there but try get an english speaking guide. They will take a group through the museum. They have some really cool things from the war scattered around the museum. Outside they have Korean and US planes. Some real, some replicas (I believe). Don’t need too much longer than 3-4 hours so it’s a good half day"
"Well done, much larger exhibit than what I expected.","It was nice to see this exhibit and I enjoyed the outdoor display of so many vintage plans, tanks, and vessels. You will need at least a couple to three hours to walk through the exhibit, although you could spend longer if you read everything they have to offer. "
Very educational,"You can learn a lot about Korea especially how the country went through its rough time with so many wars and battles. If you're interested in history or war history go check it out. I don't think the ticket was even expensive. Pick a good weather though it contains outside stuff to see as well (airplanes, tanks etc)."
History and beyond.,"The War Memorial Of Korea was amazing. We learnt a great deal by navigating the many floors that boasted with tons of history. Each step gave ample information about the wars that South Korea endured with its neighbors, especially the war with Japan, China and North Korea. This visit made me realize the great success that South Korea has achieved in this small window of time. The wars have made it stronger, better and very successful. I couldn't get enough. Just Wonderful. Go Korea! "
Amazing place! ,"We assumed that this museum would mostly be about the Korean War, but we were wrong. Not only did it have a ton of stuff on that war, but so much more. For example they had what I think was one of the best and most educating sections from the Vietnam War. I was actually very surprised at how many different wars that S Korea has helped allied forces through the years. I could go on and on about this museum, just trust me it is worth it!The museum is free, but please make a donation before you leave. "
So Much History,"Give yourself plenty of time at this memorial. It takes a good hour or more outside to view all the tanks, planes, boats and missile launchers as well as the statues. Inside there are 3 floors of history all very well organized into groups. Loved learning more about a war I was unfamiliar with."
Great Overview of the Korean War ,This memorial is definitely worth a visit. A great display including interactive and old film footage!
"Commemoration, museum or propaganda?","The Korean War Memorial is a large, imposing building near Samgakji metro station in an otherwise nondescript neighbourhood. Its size is a testament to the centrality of the Korean war to the recent history and identity of the Republic of Korea and its troubled relationship to North Korea. It is part shrine (listing the names of the hundreds of thousands of South Korean and UN/allied service-people who died in the war), part museum (giving detailed accounts of the war) and part a propaganda organ, shouting the South's version of the conflict. Despite the importance of its subject, it is far too detailed, even for a visitor - a military historian - who knows a bit about the war. I saw two young Australian women who were enduring a detailed guided tour, who plainly did not really want the detail they were being given. A lot of the presentations deal with aspects of military operations, of course, and the audio-visual programs are often hard to understand. The display outside the museum of military hardware is frankly underwhelming, unless you really do want to see (and climb into) every variety of armoured personnel carrier that the South Korean army has ever used. The galleries generally lack the element of the 'personal stories' now obligatory in most military museums.The presentation of the place (which has been open for about 25 years) is looking a bit tired (eg the 'moat' has been drained) but it's certainly worth visiting, showing the impact of the Korean war on the country, while the long corridors of names on the 'roll of honour' (which doesn't include the couple of million civilians the war killed) is sobering."
Excellent and poignant memorial,"Only had the chance to visit briefly (when the main museum was closed), however there is plenty to see in the grounds. The memorial is very well laid out and is a fitting tribute to those who have their lives in the conflict. The memorial also has an equipment display that is well worth taking time to see. Would love to have gone back to see the interior - I would have been there for hours."
Amazing,So much to see here and a wonderful memorial to all the hero’s. We spent half a day here and could have spent so much more. It is always nice to take time to thank those who have given their lives so we may be free. 
State-of-the-art war museum,"I have been to a lot of war museums in different countries and I must say that the War Memorial of Korea is by far the most advanced and interactive among them all! The museum has 3D and 4D movie rooms, a shooting area and an outdoor display of actual artillery, jets, passenger planes and ships that were used during the war. To acknowledge the help South Korea received from other countries during the war, the museum featured the countries' complete military uniforms and displayed the number of foreign military personnel that were deployed during the war. Best part of it all is that admission is free! Note, however, that the museum is closed on Mondays."
Lovely Memorial,"Stumbled across this as it was right next to our hostel so took a wander through.Lovely statues and imagery, good explanations in English, really made you think. I think my dad would have loved the tanks/planes etc behind - anyone who's into that kind of thing (as well as Korean history ofc) should definitely take a look!"
Memorial visit ,"We visited the War Memorial of Korea on Monday and found it to be shut. Many museums are closed on Monday so check before you go. It is a 500m walk from Samgakji subway station. They have an impressive outside exhibit which we were able to view including tanks, planes and boats."
One visit not enough,"I am not a history or military buff but I have visited this museum two times and always enjoy it. Korean history is very long and filled with fascinating wars and military actions. This museum gives a wonderful overview of it all. Most of the signs are in English and there are English docents nearby to help you find your way around. It is very easy to navigate through the War Museum and it never feels crowded. It is vast so start early if you want to try to see it all. There is usually a revolving exhibit space that shows new exhibits that are not military based if you need a break from the wars. However, you must pay a nominal fee for these. In addition, there are all manner of military machines outside for viewing. Don't miss the gift shop; it has some very unique and fairly priced items. Several are open to exploration and the kids love that! This museum is very easy to get to using the 4 or 6 subway line at Samgakji Station or the 110 bus. You can walk to it from Iteawon as well."
Good museum covering history of Korean war,"Good museum to visit and see the full history and unfolding of the Korean War. All explanations also in English, including the 4D video screening"
Disappointed it was shut on Monday’s ,"We visited the War Memorial of Korea and found it to be shut on Monday’s. So disappointed. Many museums are shut on Monday, make sure you check before you go. They do have a large exhibit outside which was great to see. There were boats, planes and missives. "
So good we went twice!,"Fantastic museum for all those who love history. To learn more and also to remember those who gave their lives for the ongoing freedom of South Korea from communist infiltration.Well laid out, very respectful to those involved. You can spend hours here."
Great visit for the history buff,Large and fitting memorial to the Korean War. Well-presented displays. Most displays have English translations. Most videos are in Korean with no subtitles. Worth the time for the history buff.
Great place to learn war history.,"It is a huge facility, which will take one whole day or two, to throughly read and visit all the presentations. It is free of charge for entrance, to my surprise. It has a couple of free fun rides and even free movie night. Check the program before visit."
An impressive tribute to those that gave their lives for liberty,"Impressive location and building , some interesting exhibits and also a replica of the only UN cemtery ( original at Busan) which was moving.Cafes and toilets on site. Admission is free. Take a 100WON coin to use the free of charge lockers, rather that carting your back pack round.There is a real tangiable thankfullness from the Korean people for those that served and died from the UN "" for a land they had never been to, a people they had never met"" .Closest subway staion is Samgakji (line 4 or 6) exit 12. Come out of sign posted exit and keep walking , you come to it round the corner on your left."
"Outside is quite moving, inside too dense.","This was not a patch on the Korean war memorial in Washington DC. Museum was heavy going, and yet did very little to enlighten."
War memorial and museum,This place is also know as War memorial and museum as it contains all the relics and records related to the many wars fought in the country. It’s really nice that they have the flags placed around the entrance of all the various countries that helped them during the war.
historical,just like the historical background about the place. even though i understood less Korean words but i could feel the feeling of the freedom obtained
A MUST VISIT if visiting Seoul,"I'm a history buff, but to visit the War Memorial of Korea was a really cool experience. I do recommend that you go early, as soon as they open. They have lots of field trips for kids here and it gets busy and very loud. Very informative of the Korean and Allied war efforts on the Korean Peninsula during that time and beyond. Again, it's a must visit if you have a few hours to spare. But leave yourself plenty of time to check out all 3 floors of the museum to include all of the aircraft and war machinery outside."
Loads to see here,"We thought this place would have a few commemorative statues and exhibits. To our surprise, there were 8 separate memorial exhibits including inside the building. The nearest subway for this is Samgakji."
The War Memorial of Korea,"This museum is dedicated to the periods of wartime during Korea’s history. The entire 2nd floor showcases the Korean War. You will not experience a better understanding of the Korean War anywhere else than here. It takes you from the very beginnings of the war, step by step, up until Korea’s military standing in the world today. There are thousands of displays ranging from giant tanks and planes to one sheet declassified memos reporting on the status of troops. You need at least an hour and a half to fully absorb it all. I would recommend visiting this museum twice. Also, it is ridiculously kid friendly. There are special events held for children that they seemed to really enjoy."
Don't miss it,"Thoughtful and tasteful recognition of the sacrifices made my so many countries to help Korea. Feels a bit like propaganda at some points, but they've done an excellent job documenting all the countries that came together during the war. Don't miss it if you are in town!"
Perfect place to visit before taking the DMZ tour.,"Went to the Memorial the day before a scheduled DMZ tour. It is well organized and interesting. There is an outdoor exhibit of tanks, planes and boats used in the Korean war. Exhibits are marked in English and Korean. Spent several hours at this museum. "
So much history & excellent exhibits,This war museum in Seoul South Korea was such a great experience!I went there in December 2015 on a business trip & I was amazed at how well put together the exhibits are. A few of them are audio-visual & interactive. They do a great job at educating foreigners like myself & locals alike of this trying time in South Korean history.Definitely recommended to go there at least once
Must See,"This was a great place to learn more in-depth what the war was like and struggles of those who fought through it. Their are so many displays and exhibits written in English. This museum is one of the best war museums I’ve been to. They have a large selection of Korean War era military weapons. Also on display outside, there’s quite the variety of tanks and airplanes. You could easily spend a few hours there learning about the war. I would highly recommend seeing this museum."
good to know,good to visit such place to know more about histroy of Korea and see some memorial things. it takes 2 hours
REAL MUSEUM OF WAR,"Its a must visit place for each and every individual, it's an open museum. Its displayed real ships Helicopters, Fighter planes those have participated in the war. Most wonderful thing is that all names of the soldiers who sacrifice their lives in the war are written on the wall. well maintained garden with all countries flags are and another attraction."
Quiet reflection,"Must see place in Seoul, it was a very heart warming experience to see it, very well done and staff there were very nice and helpful"
Great miseu,Amazing Museum you can go back several times and still find it fulfilling. It is very informative and the exhibits were fantastic.The history of the war was well communicated in English as well
Fantastic museum - an absolute must in Seoul,"I’ve been to many war museums and I have to say that the War Memorial of Korea is the best. Lots of statues/monuments and army vehicles outside including a very interesting area for Korean children about surviving a chemical, nuclear or biological attack. It was under the monument with the statues around it and I don’t think we were supposed to go in as the staff looked slightly shocked to see us. Of course it has its fair share of propaganda but it charts the history of Korea from the beginning to present day. There’s not much on the current North/South Korea issues. Most of the displays have an English translation and the videos could be accessed in English by pressing a button. No audio guides and the QR information code didn’t seem to be working. I went expecting to spend about an hour but ended up staying for 3.5 hours!! "
Best museum,This is my third visits and reviews. This museum is amazing. I just came back from a week visit in D.C and went so many museums there and other museums all over the world but this is one of the best museum in the world. I can`t believe it`s free. You may wanna go there by yourself or with somebody who is really interested in history because you can easily spend 3-4 hours here. You learn so much not just about war but history and people who were affected. This museum is not about korean military but for everybody who sacrificed and affected. I highly recommend to take KTX and go to Busan after this because they have UN cemetary and this museum will make you appreciate and can`t help getting emotional after learning what happned. Make sure to eat before you go because there are not many places to eat around and their cafeteria is not the best.
Great museum ,So much history it was a bit overwhelming. Much more to it than just the Korean War. We ended up there about two hours before closing and it wasn’t enough time. 
Good place to know more about korean war,This is a good place to find out more about the korean war and the history behind it. It was a nice place to be for a few hrs to hide away from the hot sun. 
Not very interesting,"I didnt find this place very interesting, compared to other similar places that I have visited in the past."
Excellent History Museum,I didn’t know much about the history of Korea and this museum allowed to understand more about what the country and people have been through. Excellent artifacts and displays. People were very polite. I recommend this museum! You will learn a lot in a matter of 1 hour
A must while in Korea.,"This is a must go while in Korea in order to get to know better the details of the Korean war. It is not a sophisticated museum, but is definitely informative."
Great Stop,This is one of the stops on the hop on hop off bus. My first time coming to Korea I did stop off here as my last stop for the day. I didn't go in the actual building but I walked around outside as there is a lot to see outside the museum from lots of memorial statues to various types of military planes that were used during this time. I got a lot of photos and enjoyed myself. Would definitely recommend as an attraction to visit during your stay if you like history.
"Nice military museum, free entrance",Nice to see near hisrtory. Outside are equipments and full story of Korean War. Other histori is quite limited. Recommed
With friend,Went with friend to this museum. The museum is so big and informative. I love how they keep tracking al their heroes. 
A MUST Place To Visit Even If You Are Not A Soldier,"This War Memorial evoked feelings I never thought I had about wars. I have never been through one and with this visit, it was an eye opener. My respect to veterans, soldiers around the world. I salute you."
History unfold and future learning,"There is a very special and honoring feeling when you go to this museum.Very thankful for everyone's sacrifices and lives for peace.Great format.Clean.Friendly staff.Good collection.Well thought displays.Organized.Great learning.Thank you for everyone who made it possible for us to learn and be thankful of your sacrifices, help, courage ."
Free and Enriching Visit,"The War Memorial of Korea, to me, is a must visit. The outdoor area sets itself on a different level when compared to other war memorial due to the fact that they had displayed the different transports or war machine that was used in the past. In the inside, there are simply a lot of exhibition that talks about the history of the wars that Korea was involved in. However, do take note, that majority of the still exhibits are in Korean though there are some that are in English."
very nice,"it was very huge and had lots of history, loved each section as it gave details on different part of history. Outdoor planes, helicopter, tanks, armored vehicle's and replica of navy ship were displaced. my children loved each bit of it."
Not to be missed,"The War Memorial includes a museum, military hardware outside and several monuments to the fallen. I don't visit too many museums but found this extremely interesting as i learnt all about the Korean War. The museum is free to enter and at certain times of the day there are free tours in English and other languages. Outside is a wonderful display of tanks, planes, artillery and even a naval vessel. At the front of the museum there are several monuments commemorating the fallen. Inside there are free lockers to store bags."
very somber,I learned more about the war than I had known. It is a very interesting museum. I would like to spend more time to see everything.
HUGE!,"This place is huge! I loved the huge, moving statues outside. We couldn't even cover a quarter of the place!"
A Must See,"This museum is beautifully presented and a guided tour is a must. The guide will give a detailed description of South Koreas invasion by the north and its visually stunning and thought provoking. There is a large area outside full of tanks, airplanes, a ship , helicopters and missiles that you can get up close to. No entry fee and a very detailed FREE book awaits you as you arrive. Incredibly impressed with this museum and it has lots of areas centred around youngsters as well. Great for all ages"
Mesmerizing depiction of history.,"I've been to the War Memorial of Korea several times. Each time I learn something new. It's a great museum and has very cool exhibits that make it easy to understand the history. I especially like the exhibits on the Korean War. If you visit, I recommend doing the 4D theater experience of the Battle for Incheon. It was fun (and free). Actually, the whole museum is free, but they do accept donations. They also run tours in multiple languages."
So much to see,We didn't even go inside as it wasn't open that but still spent an hour looking at the memorials in the gardens. Very poignant. 
A must visit museum in Seoul,My 1st time experience going to a war museum indeed it’s a must visit place in Seoul. Pretty cool place wit lots of war machines on display.
A must see in Seoul,"Many visitors from outside of Korea have limited familiarity with the events surrounding the Korean Conflict. This memorial and the museum grounds provide an excellent overview of the sometimes violent history of the Korean Peninsula and specifically the war between the ROK and the DPRK. Like other modern museums, the galleries are organized in a linear fashion, enabling visitors to understand the events leading up to the war as well as critical moments in the conflict. It focuses on both military and civilian experiences and does a very compelling job of narrating the history."
Excellent Memorial and Museum,"This is not just a memorial to the Korean War but it also has displays from conflicts on the Korean peninsula from ancient time to present time. It provided a very good history of Korea. There were also plenty of military hardware on display on the outside of the building. Admission is free. This place was much better than I had expected. A hat and sunscreen are highly recommended if walking around the outside displays since there isn’t much shade.Be sure to pick up the free War Memorial of Korea pamphlet at the entrance which has a map and description of the displays. The displays are well-organized with descriptions in both Korean and English. There are three floors. There is a cafe, gift shop, and toilets on site."
Love the outdoor display - have been going there since a kid,"A massive war memorial and a great place to take a pictures of the automobiles and planes on display outside. The museum is clean and intuitive and provides lots of information about wars in Korea. It will take a good 3 hours to check out the place. I don't mind going there for 5 hours or so. There is a restaurant that provides food there and so don't worry about being hungry. If you do want to go outside and pop back in, that is possible. Although, it can be a long walk until Samgakji Station, where you will find Korean restaurants for food. I have made it to 155 countries. I have an extensive blog at pinchetravels.com, if you want to read more about my travels."
"A massive, treasure trove of historical information! A must see for everyone!","I went here the first time with my family about one year and a half ago. We loved it! We also saw a demonstration of sorts. It was fantastic! It's like the changing of the guards in Gongbukgyeon palace only with a huge amount of imperial guards with their traditional warrior uniforms and their flags! It was amazing! I thought to myself, I will come back here again in the future. Fast forward to now, I went to visit with my parents this time. We walked the museums and took photos of all the exhibits. And more awesome, they are FREE to see! How cool is that! We didn't see any performances but just to walk around the whole place was a great experience. The Koreans just take pride in their history and they want to share it with the world! We truly appreciate their history and hospitality. We would love to come back again in the future."
Excellent memorial on Korean War and more,"The main attraction is definitely Korean War memorial and they did a great job. There are lots of valuable documents, items, but I think what they did most well is the interactive theaters and screens. They are not too long (around 5 minutes) but each of them give you a taste of a particular battle or important event. The museum are divided into stages within the Korean War - the early stage of Invasion by North Korea and US assisted counter-attack. The second stage of Chinese Army invasion and finally the last stage that led to armistices. Also numerous tanks, planes, and warship on the side of the museum and a children's museum (not sure why) attached to the War Memorial Museum for your kids' enjoyment.Overall a must visit and prepare to spend a good part of the day here."
Very Nice Garden and War Vehicle for Photos,"I visit this place only exploring the outside of building. It is a very nice park and we can see a lot of war vehicle such as war ship, war airplane, etc."
Great tribute...,A wonderful tribute to those that sacrificed for the freedom of South Korea. Must see for anyone visiting Seoul!
Large outdoor display of airplanes,My boys who are history buffs loved it. Closes at 6pm but outdoor area where the planes are parked are open all the time. There is a warship replica docked outside too which was pretty interesting.Now I finally know why the North and South were at war!Recommended! And free!!
"Amazing, and a must see","What an impressive place this is. As an American, I feel so ignorant on the Korean war. I learned a lot here, and it was very interesting to see. You have to visit this place."
Reverent,Great memorial a must see. So many little details about the memorial that you have to ask the attendant. So many things have significance like the number of soldiers the echted faces on the wall. Go and be respectful.
Amazing history,"Spent a good few hours here, there is so much to see and so many pictures to take. Absolutely amazing, the workers there are so friendly, gave me a couple of leaflets to explain the history. It really does touch you. So if your interested in history I totally recommend this place. It’s just beautiful. "
So many things to see from very close!,"If you like airplanes, canon, tank, etc. It’s a really nice place to visit! It’s free and there are a lot of machines that you can see or even touch!"
Very nice memorial,"I am not a huge history buff, but this memorial/museum is extremely well done and informative. The memorial statues are well done, the old tanks and planes interesting to see, and the museum gave me a concise overview of the Korean war and history. You can only shop and eat so much in Seoul. Take an hour or two and stop by this memorial, you won't regret it! Bonus, it's free!"
What a great experience ,"Another place to give you a complete review about Korean Hystory.Don't forget to pick a war chronicles book at the entrance, it is fee.Lots of pavilions with several war itmes ... places ... cars ... And of course tons of Korean History details easy to go thru."
Must-see when visiting Seoul,A sobering look at the geopolitics of the Korean peninsula. Ignore some of the South Korean propaganda and you'll get a great perspective of what makes Korea tick. Walk through all the floors to discover fascinating history of Korea. I would suggest going to this place first; You'll see Seoul in quite a different light. 
Nice place,Sombre and wonderfully curated. I learned about the history of war on the peninsula and the events of the Korean War. The outside a with the tanks planes and such was really neat too. 
What are they teaching the children?,"It's a weird scene -a lot of one-sided displays, some really cool military hardware, juxtaposed against mobs of schoolchildren all over the place. Not really schoolchildren -we're talking barely kindergartners if that... oddly posing with cartoon characters right next to massive bombers and such.Inside, there was a memorial service for a hero of the Korean War killed in 1953, complete with wreaths, speakers and many modern-day military officers sitting and standing in attention in full regalia. Nearby, a group of toddlers posed by a picture of an island that Korea currently disputes with Japan. I don't speak Korean, but the teacher was prodding them to raise their little fists in the air and shout something triumphal-sounding, so they could all take a group photo presumably proclaiming their solidarity with Korea's claim to the island. It's a little scary... I'm not used to seeing preschool children being actively indoctrinated quite so overtly at quite such a tender age, even in countries where you'd think that kind of stuff goes on. The museum is free, it's huge, there's a lot to see... captivating propaganda for sure. But propaganda nonetheless."
Educatiobal,Gives an outsider a better understanding of why North Korea exists and how american culture has influenced South Korea. Must visit 
English tour,"This museum is very well done and maintained. Tours in other languages including English are free 2x a day. The tour is very nice. A retired ROK colonel gave us the tour. Tour runs 90 minutes. Great displays inside and out for kids. Retired planes, tanks, parachutes you name it!"
Sight seeing,"While on business, I went aight seeing and the war memorial of Korea was a must see and would definitely go visit again. Was a little upset that the shops closed an hour prior to the museum but would factor that into the next visit."
Touching and educational,"Having been stationed on Okinawa for over four years, I'm very familiar with the war in the pacific but did not know much about the Korean War. This again is another free museum that you need to take your time with as there is a lot to take in. There were even free books highlighting events of the war chronologically. I feel so much better educated after having visited the War Memorial. I'm inspired to re-watch episodes of MASH as I have a reference now."
Enjoyable,Enjoyed the War Memorial. Gave more insight on the war and got to see artifacts and listen to stories. Would recommend while in Seoul. You also don't need a tour guide to go and enjoy. 
So much information. So much to learn.,"I knew very little about the history of Korea before visiting this museum. But after a few hours walking around the exhibits, I left with a good understanding the how the country got to where it is and where it fits in historically with it's neighbors (Japan, China, Russia, etc.). It not only explains the Korean War but also several dynasties of rule, war and development. Definitely worth a few hour visit."
Detailed and intresting,"Great deal of work and details have been put into creating/organizing and managing the place. Awesome pieces and collection in the exibition, the outdoor collection if old aircrfats, tanks and flank guns and other military equipments from the korean war is a delight to see.And its Free Free Free"
Must-go place,"I got myself to learn tons of new things here about history of Korea , so tremendous and sacred site "
Impressive," I didn't know that much about the Korean war (except having watched every episode of MASH), for instance I hadn't realised that just over a thousand British servicemen were lost that's less than the Northern Ireland troubles and that over 30 thousand US servicemen were killed. It was good to see that all countries that supplied servicemen and women were represented with a memorial and flag and a short description of their commitments. I did enjoy the military equipment graveyard, even the wife didn't complain.  My interest was piqued about the previous Japanese invasions of Korea having seen the displays of the turtle ships. I've now read several articles about these invasions. It's well worth visiting the memorial, if nothing else than paying your respects for our fallen countryman."
Don’t be a loser go check this joint out.,Hey! Don’t be a loser. Go to the memorial. It has a totally sweetsauce outside section with planes and tanks that you can get into and take photos. Tons of super cute kids running around doing cute stuff. Cool boat that you can climb around on. The entrance to the inside has massive walls of all the names of fallen soldiers. Tried to find people with my last name. Couldn’t. Which was a bummer but also good. If you walk the inside direction backwards not only do you get a lot of “what a idiot looks” but also it feels like you are traveling back in time. You can only bar hop and eat food so many hours in a day and with that 2 hour break come here.A
Somber history lesson of Korea's tribulations ,"One of the initial rooms resembles a starry night, with a pensive in the middle. I found it moving, and it set the tone for the rest of the visit. Of course, the museum captures the spirit of the combined actions taken to keep the Republic Of Korea free in the face of tyrants during the 1950's, but the older wars are equally well represented."
Great Museum,One of the best museums that I have visited and it is free! My kids loved it especially the 3d/4d rides. The videos screened are also very good and provide a good snapshot of the history during the period. Must visit attraction if you are in Seoul
Unlike Any Other Monument,"We almost skipped this, thinking we had all been to DC and seen a million war memorials. This one is soooo different! I have never been to a more hopeful and humble memorial, giving credit and thanks to all the other nations that came to their aid. I don’t want to give any spoilers, but this memorial has an affect on us unlike any other I’ve been to."
Almost as good as Canberra.,"A really interesting, well set out and informative place. Not only full history of the Korean War but lots on the feudal battles of the distant past. Many exhibits of ordinance Very detailed information throughout for English speakers.The only war museum that comes anywhere near the one in Canberra. Do not expect a quick visit there is so much to see. And it's free!"
"A terrific, balanced view of a terrible war","The thoughtful retelling of the years 1950-1953 and the immense sacrifice and suffering is done very well here. It is a quick, thorough way to orient yourself to the Korean War and its enduring legacy."
Seoul Must-Do ,"A huge war museum with detailed information in English and Korean about South-Korea's war-filled past. It's free entry and you can see original tanks, planes and boats and 4D screenings. "
Historical memorial place,"Truly an awesome place to learn about the history of Korean War and showing honour to the people who had defended and sacrifice for their country. There are also exhibits of planes, tanks, warship and others at open area of the building. Best part of all, it's free. "
"Huge museum in military history, hardware galore","Much more than a war memorial (that part us actually the less interesting one) - huge museum with many exhibits not just on the Korean War but also all aspects of Korean military history throughout the ages. Lots of military hardware on display, and most exhibits have English captions (though often abbreviated). The Korean conflict was narrated from the South Korean perspective naturally, which can be interesting and rather different from the version seen in the literature on the war in tEnglish. Parts of the museum are a bit run down, and the displays are perhaps not always illuminating. Nonetheless really not to be missed for those with an interest in this field."
Poignant,"Quite an amazing place. Amazed to see such a selection of aeroplanes, tanks, rockets and even a boat. But then the memorial with all the names of those who died, together with the complete history of the war is very solemn. Well worth visiting."
Amazingly extensive collection,"We started off with the outside expositions. There are two exhibits and many planes, tanks, 2 small boats and 1 large you that you can board and visit the insides. We watched the 3D movie after visiting the boat (I'd recommend watching it beforehand). Turns out it's the exact boat from the battle in 2002. They've indicated all the bullet holes in red, which really makes reality sink in.Once you walk in inside, there is a stand with pamphlet and a museum map. It goes without saying to follow the arrows on the ground. We started off with the last exhibits by accident and were a bit confused, as the exhibitions are in chronological order.The preservation of all the artifacts are impeccable. The amount of donated artifacts is astounding. Everything is translated in English and is very detailed.War buff or not, this is a must. It is a wonderful exhibit. "
A must see!,Definitely a place to visit when in Seoul. The admission is free and the museum has something for everyone.Outside there are several airplanes and tanks to observe. Each one has a sign explaining what it was used for during the war. Near the ship there is a 3D movie representing what it was like to be in a fighter jet.Inside the museum the displays are very respectful and detailed. There are several texts to read and short movies to watch. It explains very well the war and outcome of Korea. It is possible to spend an hour as it is possible to spend all day at this location. 
Good history and good collection,this is good for History buff. its has a lot material to see and understand the history and ancient Korea. 
Respectful,"This was not like so many other war musems in Asia.It was an historical trip, so respectful to those who gave their lives.No gory photos etc. or propoganda.Sad statute of 2 brothers, opposite sides, embracing on battlefield.Also wall plaks with names, so many. A class place."
Must visit,"Impressive Museum with extensive memorial.Names of all the fallen soldiers and their country of origin listed.Info in English, free entrance.You could spend a few hours, there is also a cafe."
A must visit in Seoul.,"You could easily spend an entire day in this museum and still not see everything. There were renovations being made to the pavers in front of the main entrance when I visited, so I sort of came in on the side. That gave me an opportunity to view more of the monuments outside, including the MacArthur Tree, which I had no idea even existed. The museum spans all of Korean history, not just the recent conflict. It is well worth the time to take a leisurely tour of the exhibits if at all possible. Just the war machinery outside could be a morning or afternoon.I recommend spending the 1000 won to feed the fish. It's a peaceful way to end the visit."
Surprisingly interesting,I am no so fan of museum since its hard to understand but this place it is worthy to see it! Inside all the story it's explained about the Korean war and if you don't have time you have outside all the planes and tanks from the war. Also the memorial itself is stunning!!! 
Impressive ,"It is really impressive,especially for nationalists and military people.First of all its free.They have the arms ,thanks and planes of both sides,that includes russian,chinese and american arms.Koreans are equal to all countries that shed blood for south! As an example,us lost of man,Turkey lost 894 man and luxemburg lost 1 man .But the section in museum is same and equal for all."
Went for 1hr and stayed 4,It put the history of Korea in context for me starting from prehistoric times to current. It made me realise that invasions and wars not only shaped Korea but the whole world.I found it extremely interesting both inside and the external displays of military machinery.Beautifully presented. There are lots of video screens and (very short ) movie rooms. For families it would be a great day on very hot or raining days. Kids would love it --without realising the tragedy of it all . The station is only abouit 200m away. There is a basic café and a souvenir shop . There is no charge to visit.
Superb museum. Attention to detail and well with full information for the English reader.,"* Spent most of the day there* Outside area with tanks, planes and rockets* Very comprehensive history of the Korean war, plus one floor dedicated to the earlier history, including Japanese occupation* Impressive building* 4D cinema show* Nice grounds with water and gardens* Free entry, and also free book on the topic* Also a kids museum (although did not look round this), and they had a kids play area and cafe etc* In short, one of the best museums in the world that we have visited"
History Korea,Only the view on this musea is allready imposant.The expositions are respectfull to the history and give you A lot of information about the korean war.The lost of soliders and also the UN soldiers is many.You will vind all the namens of the Dutch lostI recomended to visit this museum.The fee is free
Impressive,"Very detailed, interesting and interactive museum on the Korean War. While it is sometimes a bit biased in its presentation of the Korean War and aftermath it's much less the case than expected. A must do in Seoul!"
Best free day out in Seoul,Visit the war museum in the afternoon it was the best war memorial museum I have seen in the world. Highly recommended 
Dioramas?,"Any war memorial or museum should bring home to people the horror and terror of war. This one tries to do that by having wax figures posed in various dioramas.This does it a disservice - it becomes entertainment, on a level with war movies where we know the heroes will come out alive. There is enough archival materials to present instead of these dolls."
The B52 in real life is shocking,"As a Vietnamese, being able to witness the B52 with my own eyes is something very special. I took my sister here and we were in shock the whole time. Every tanks, airplane and ships are in excellent condition. A very good place for children to learn about history as well! "
A Museum for Peace,"A very poignant and somber experience will hit anyone who enters this building as Korea tell their story about the wars that have inflicted the country including Japanese colonisation and the Korea War which inevitably led to the spitting of the country into North and South Korea and the country's that came to South Korea's side in their time of need. The museum is very big and will probably take most people 3 to 4 hours to get round entirely but there are some not worthy exhibitions including the donated articles and relics and the Korea War segment and all the vehicles outside. The museum is free , there is free Wi-Fi and there is a cafe for anyone who can't stand a 3 hour museum visit."
Definitely worth going,"They start with some general background, and afterwards continue with war rooms each logically divided into time zones. They specify and repeat information a lot but its good as it helps understanding. They added some audio-visual rooms which are a great touch"
Great exhibits,"If you’re a history enthusiast, there’s so much to see and learn from the museum. If you have time and you’d wish to dive deeper into the history of Korea, make sure you watch those videos and some exhibits were interestingly displayed."
Great for all ages ,"This place is truly beautiful. First off, it’s FREE. What a great place to go for no money at all. It’s educational, and coming from someone who HATES war museums and such, this was actually really interesting. The art was incredible in the memorials. Absolutely stunning. And the museum portion was so interesting and interactive. You get to go onto a real ship that was once shot up. It’s really interesting.Great for all ages, but be wary of the many stairs if you have any elderly with you."
Awesome Tanks Display and Museum,"Real tanks and rockets display outside are the highlight for me. But the Museum itself is very informative, clean and organized - a lot of things to see like the turtle boat of Admiral Yi. Very child friendly. We spent 4-5 hours there. Highly recommended. "
South korean perspective ,It's an interesting place to spend a couple of hours. I like how they emphasize the costs of the war to the ordinary families. A good educational experience.
A powerful and respectful reminder,"Each time I return to Korea, this is a must see on my list. This year for the first time I took my wifre. This is not a day to rush. Take ypur time, look and read. The displays inside and out ate second to none and the constant upgrades with technology have made this a must see. Be prepared to shed a tear when you sit in one of the many viewing/video rooms and the remembrance hall and chamber. The new 3 and 4 D interactive shows bring the story of a nation besieged and the world that stood by it. The Korean people are so grateful and will never forget the contributions of all other nations and this is made very clear in their hommage to all that stepped in to help them. Returned Servicemen and women and veterans, if you have PTSD then the reality of some of the displaus and shows may cause you to trigger. Every time I see something new and have left without a tear in my eyes. The raw honesty of this facility even left my wife in tears. Please leave a couple of thousand Won in one of the donation boxes. This is a free admission and it really helps to provide an amazing experience. P.S. if you are taking a school group, please ask the kids to show respect, no yelling, swearing and running around. This is a memorial to thousands who will never go home and a somber reminder of the great waste and distruction of armed conflict."
5 star Museum,"Never thought to stop at this war museum, just because of the jet fighter outside of the museum that you can see when bus passing by that place. I just walk alone in this area start with the all the warrior names. Than start to explore all the hall and this museum is awesome, war history, skeleton of Sargent, lighting for real war situation, 4D 7 minute movie, 3D 7 minute movie in the war ship, all the jet and carrier aeroplane, tanker, launcher and war ship too.. This museum is amazing and they really appropriate their lost soldier and warrior. highly recommend people to come over here and they also give book korean war 1129 for free."
Wonderful Museum,"This museum was very informative and being an American whose grandfather fought in the war, it was very touching. The Korean people are very thankful to the UN for fighting alongside them. I learned a lot about the war, as did my boyfriend who is a history buff."
"Great info. Statues, memorials, planes.","Most poignant was the statute of 2 brothers embracing on the field of battle, one fighting for the North and one for the South, standing on a dome with a crack in it representing the division of the Koreas. A number of airplane including a B52 bomber as well as a Korean made observation airplane the type of which hadn’t been seen in decades until it was discovered in a Korean high school and restored. Lots of information about the War. Only a couple blocks from 2 Metro stops - we took the #4 line."
A must do!,"This place is amazing and FREE! They even offer a free book on the Korean war. You can donate upon exiting, which I did.Outside, the different monuments are accessible to all and in the building itself there are different permanent exhibitions all wotrh a visit. I only spent about 2 hours there but youc an certainly spend more time. It's a great place to try to understand why there are two Koreas today..."
Must see if in Seoul,"You'll feel a range of emotions going through this place. The dome with the crack down the middle, two soldiers on top embracing, that is something that will hit you hard.The planes, tanks, guns, etc are great for the kids.The part that hit me the hardest was they have the names of all the soldiers that died during the war. And not just the Korean soldiers, they had the names of each foreign soldier that died also. They were divided by country, and the USA was divided into states. Gives you a better idea of the scale of the war when you have to walk by the names of everyone that died. A good history tour inside the memorial as well, although a bit long."
Freedom is not free,The history starts from the ancient age to till the 1953. Anyone can live the history in this place. Inside the museum don't miss the tear drop and outside the peace and war statue. 
Very interesting,"This was one of the stops on our bus tour and it looked nice on the pictures, so we decided to give it a try. It is really informative and very well done. Good for kids too, as there are many things to see for them (planes, boats etc.). We didn't go into the museum, just walked around outside. Very impressed, totally worth a visit!"
fascinating and sad,"An amazing memorial giving an insight into the Korean war, free admission and a fascinating display of the history of the war and subsequent events. Don't miss this one..."
Superb museum,"Very nice museum. Free entry. Very big n interactive n gives a good perspective of the Korean war and world history. Really nicely maintained n surely worth around1.5hours. lots of army, aircraft vehicles etc in outside area. Inside, it had a lot of audio visual and historical documents, attracts regarding the Korean war. Totally worth it and popular with families, tourists and history seekers! "
Amazing,"I have been to several memorials throughout the world and this is one of the best. There is an outdoor museum displaying various tanks, guns, aircraft and a patrol boat. It even has a B-52 bomber on display. The staff are friendly and helpful and the exhibits are really well put together. I will go again for another look next time im in Seoul."
Very Impressive even if you don't think you will be into it,I visited this place because it had high reviews on Trip Advisor. I was not expecting too much of it but it was a great experience. I was just disappointed by the national Museum and this memorial saved my day. Totally worth the visit and plan 3 hours at least to go through it.
Very impressive,"I took the English tour at 14:00. I visited here before long time ago, so do not recall what I saw at that time. Couple of years ago, I felt too huge to visit so I visted only the outdoor exhibition. The tour takes alsmot 1 and half hour, the volunteer explain quite well about the details. it is also included 2 short clip, each of them 10, 15 min long. One of them, Jan 4 Heungnam port retreat, this clip runs in a cold room so need a jacket. I recommend this place if you are interested in Korean war and WWII."
easy to spend a full day here.,We thought it was going to be a quick trip but stayed all day. There are so many things to see and lots of english to read. The statues were fantastic and the whole day was well spent.
One of the Best War Memorials/Museums I've seen,"We recently visited Seoul for a week and has the opportunity to visit The War Memorial of Korea and I'm so glad we did. The the Memorial is as much a museum as it is a memorial. It is incredible collection of uniforms, equipment and weaponry used by the countries that were represented under the UN flag.during the Korean War. One of the best collections I've ever seen. And from a memorial perspective it is as moving as any I have seen short of the tomb of the unknown soldier at Arlington National Cemetery near DC. The War Memorial of Korea is very large. The outside displays have some very interesting sculptures, and include acres of military hardware. Some of a highlights of the outside display include a med size patrol boat, tanks and anti-aircraft guns and a B-52. Inside the building there are memorial rooms and room with equipment and uniform display from all of the UN countries that participated. It is quite impressive. It was very clear that Koreans are thankful for the support and sacrifices from all of the countries that helped them. You can spend hours at this place if you want to. Any time though is well spent. An it's free to the public. "
Great day out for kids,"It was a great day out for kids have a look at all the planes, tanks even an old battle ship. The place also has a children museum which has hourly tours you can take surprisingly it was free. The place is interactive and teaches a lot about korean history. "
Large and well curated museum,"We were really impressed with how interesting this museum was. The building itself was huge and was architecturally significant in itself. The memorial spanned over a few levels and was quite creative in how it presented its information. There were large scale replicas, video displays and outside there was a large collection of military vehicles. We spent a couple of hours here."
Most educational and impressively planned museum,"I am one who is normally not interested in museum tours. Since I was in a group who is interested I went along with them. Our English Guide, Mr Park ,who is a retired military colonel explained so passionately about Korean war history that I felt so enlightened and inspired and appreciated Korea in a different light beside it's a paradise for shopping and food. Thank you Mr Park for extending extra time and sharing so much with us."
Incredible,"The outer grounds of the War Memorial of Korea are impressive enough, with several larger-than-life statues/monuments, as well as an impressive collection of interactive planes, ships, and ground vehicles from the Korean War and beyond. The outer walls of the museum are lined with the names of all who died during the conflict, and the the interior of the Memorial is actually three floors stacked with an enormous amount of exhibits and information on not only the Korean War, but also the many conflicts Korea has been involved in in its long history."
Definitely worth a visit,"The war museum offers an excellent way to learn about Korea’s war history. It is well laid out, informative, thoughtful and multi-lingual. The grounds are also pretty impressive, with plenty of ex-service aircraft and tanks to walk amongst. "
Well worth a visit if interested,"I stopped by to use a few hours before I flew out, and I should of allocated more time. Covers the full history of war from Korea's beginnings until present time. Huge building, with plenty of interactive exhibits. There is a large number of items to see.If you are interested in history, then I suggest more than 4 hours for this memorial."
War buff must.,"So much to see - you really need at least a good half day to get around the exhibits and displays. History about the conflicts in the region range from ancient wars to current situations including the Korean involvement with peacekeeping forces. Very emotional, as the tributes to those who gave their lives are really well set out, touching and genuine. The addition of more recent information about the hope for reunification adds a modern touch to this very well set out and organised establishment. Good english coverage with appropriate materials available for foreigners. A must."
Where's a 6 ☆ when you want it,"Went expecting to be there for a couple of hoursFive hours later we had to leave as we had other things to seeAnd we only scratched the surfaceExpected to focus on the Korean War but this place is about so much more, from 'ancient history' to current conflicts and peacekeeping. And it is all so wonderfully doneEnough english to explain without being wordyGood clear logical route through, just follow the arrows on the floorOne of the best museums we have been to, anywhere in our 70+ countries so far"
Sculptures depicting the Korean War,The War Memorial of Korea had sculptures and artwork that were very moving and showed how the South Koreans feel about the war with the North and their hopes of reconciliation for a one Kore. The area also had some nice cherry blossom trees. Worth the visit.
A must for all War-buffs!,"Being a war buff, this was a really cool museum to visit. I loved the dioramas that were on display as it really gave you a feel of how it would have been during the Korean war. What a great tribute to the fallen too!Good on Seoul to have such a memorial - if I was a local, it would surely instill a sense a strong national pride in me!"
My Favorite Seoul Attraction,"Our visit lasted almost six hours. The first hour was spent outside, in extremely cold weather, looking at aircraft, tanks, missiles, bombs, trucks, helicopters, and even a war ship from the last 100 years. Very impressive outdoor memorials that are worth visiting as well. Once inside, a wide variety of displays from the beginning of civilization through all the wars is on display; way too numerous to even begin to describe. Excellent, HUGE building, first-class all the way. Korea is proud of their military, their history, and their patriotism."
Unexpectedly moving,"Definitely a must-visit for history buffs and people interested in diplomacy, intl relations and politics. Makes you appreciate international cooperation in resolving conflicts, and restoring peace. Come here also to honor the soldiers who died or went missing during the Korean war. The facility has stone columns with all the soldiers’ names written on them. Not just Koreans but from all other countries who helped through the UN. The museum inside is foreigner- friendly - with free tours in diff languages and interactive materials also in several languages. Free admission comes with a free English/Korean book on the Korean War which you get from the lobby of the facility. "
Very interesting,"As an history buff, going to Seoul without being to the war memorial is half the experience. The museum was well organized with great exhibits. The only down side was the fact that for some attractions, curtain hours are available. So you cant always explore every aspect of it."
Amazing inside and out!,"I have been to Korea so many times but this is the first time I've been here and I was really shocked that I have not visited before. The place was really amazing. The grounds is so big and the outside exhibit simply took my breath away. From the war planes, tanks and ammunition you can inspect up close to the beautiful manicured grounds it was pure eyegasm! the indoor exhibit is a story of its own. the way South Korea preserve and tell their history is really humbling and eye opening. It explain why they were able to rise above every tragedy."
This place gets better every year,This war museum gets better every time I visit it. I remember when it first opened over 20 years ago and it gets better every time I visit it. It's definitely a must-see location for Korea visitors.
"Fantatic museum, great outdoor exhibits","This museum is a must see when in Seoul, very interesting exhibits inside. The outside statues and displays are incredible. I loved looking at all the planes, tanks etc. I have no idea how they got a b-52 in downtown Seoul but it's very impressive."
humbling,amazing place with loads of things to see. the site itself is incredible and learned loads about the Korean war and other periods of the Korean historywould highly recommend a visit
A MUST!,"I never thought I would love this place! I wish I had more time to read and watch everything. I would definitely come back and spend a day here. I recommend everyone to come to this place if you have a chance. This place has a lot to offer and don't even know where to begin. Just come and explore this place. Not to mention, admission is FREE! "
Totally worth a visit,Both inside and outside a beautiful museum. Most information also provided in English. Planes and other military related vehicles outside. You'll be easily spending at least a whole afternoon here.
Large grounds,Several statues and many airplanes available for viewing. Even a large war boat which one can board and walk on deck.
Nice place ,Very nice place it was a very nice place to visit in Seoul. Lots of history and information. Interesting airplanes and guns left from 1950 and many more. Must see 
You can't miss!,"The memorial is the best place to go if you are interested in the history of Korean War - you can see airplanes, helicopters and even a warship (which can be visited inside); be prepared to spend the whole afternoon there. And it's free!"
Excellent depiction of WAR,"I must say I walked around that piece a couple of times, and walked back thinking I may have missed something. "
Great museum ,Very interesting museum located close to yongsan Went there on a Friday afternoon! Crowds were minimal. History covers a wide range of periods. Has a nice vehicle display outside as well as inside. 7 year old enjoyed it. Best part is the museum is free. So it’s nice if you want to go multiple times to take it all in. 
good,"interesting, a lot of things to see and learn about Korea's recent history. Many things to see from Korean perspectives"
Amazingly interesting and well organized,This is a MUST visit. The museum is amazingly rich with the war history of Korea with special emphasis on the Korean War.Try and have a guided tour as this will lead you through the most interesting stops in this museum. Later on you can go back and re-visit it.Entrance is free and so are the guided tours.We learned A LOT from it.
Understanding Korea,"The war memorial museum is huge and very moving. Maybe over 1000000 died and for no clear advantage on either side and no clear ending. The struggle of Koreans over 2000 years to have their own country, free and independent, is well highlighted ."
So much to see and learn about,"We stumbled upon this place because it is near our hotel. We now wonder why we did not visit this place on our previous trips to Seoul. It is not just a memorial. There was an open air exhibit of the armament that took part in the Korean War. There is also a military history museum, showing warfare on the Korean peninsular from ancient time to the Korean War. Highly recommended to all who are interested in history and warfare."
A good Historical Place to visit ,"It’s a good place to visit if you would like to know about the war history of Korea. A lot of planes, tanks and equipments used during war are displayed. "
Must Go!!! Great Museum,"This is a very educational museum. It is free of charge. You can also bring home a thick book about Korean War. The builiding is very nice, quite and peaceful. You learn a lot about the War. You may have hear about Korean War, but after the trip you will know all. If you like to read everything in detail, 1 day barely enough. For me, I will visit again because I still not able to go over the top floor....For the museum, there are no sign. When you exit the subway for museum, remember just go straight and follow the road. The museum is actually on your left hand side when you exit the station. However, you will not be able to see because of the surrounding building. (I actually got lost)."
"Impressive quality, effects and care about details. ","Make sure you have enough time to visit the three floors of the museum. It is arranges in a clever way to intrigue the visitors with original videos, sounds and memorabilia. And it is free admittance. Great job. "
A great place to learn about Korean history,The visit was free and we had the chance to learn a lot about the Korean history and the Korean war.Highly recommend it!
Interesting content and excellent quality!,"We joined the free tour led by a veteran who speaks impeccable English! He really knew things and every detail of war. I enjoyed his humorous and educating guide. And surprisingly, there was a parade in the middle of the tour so we ended the tour in the middle and watch it. The show was stunning and and dance and music performed by the soldiers were excellent. The exhibit inside also told a coherent and engaging story of Korean history. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
Free and excellent!,"The museum is full of world war display, ammunition, bombs, equipments, uniforms etc. There are details about how each military from different countries are outfitted, different roles they played. There is also a movie theater for you to watch and relax. Outside the museum, there are many military vehicles on display. Definitely one of the better museums I have been, recommended to all."
interesting statue and exhibit of history,very engaging and interesting museum where the history of korea explain. it helps me understand and appreciate korea culture a little more.i spent about 2-3 hours there
As a US citizen excellent,"I was born after the Korean so this was especially interesting. I really learned a lot and I love going to war museums in different countries especially to get a different perspective. The plane, chopper and tank display outside was amazing. I would really recommend to Americans to take the time to visit here."
Fantastic Museum and Memorial,"We caught the subway here from our hotel expecting to spend an hour. It was easily 3 hours, an excellent place to visit and learn the history of the Korean war. Some of the best displays we have seen and most have explanations in several languages ( if I remember correctly; Korean, English, Chinese & Japanese) Also if you are into military vehicles then you will appreciate the outdoor display. Well worth a visit."
A revisit. And a great one ,"Never get bored visiting this museum, the exterior ground is currently under renovation. Comparing to my last visit they've added a few machinery guns and displays on the North Korean army side. One could spend an easy 3-4 hours! And the best part is it's free. "
"Informative, engaging and interesting","Visited this museum as my husband is keen on looking at tanks. Was a bit hesitant at first, but tagged along anyway. To my surprise, it was very interesting! The exhibitions are multi-lingual so we could read and fully understand. There were a lot of interactive and immersive displays too. Best part - admission is free! :D "
Excellent Visit Place,A most recommended for the people interested in the history. The Place has so much to offer that you can spend a whole day watching old war-related things.
War Memorial Of Korea,"Great place to visually see the history of South Korea and countries involved during the war, and is free. The museum is large you could spend a few hours, would be great for anyone interested in history and I feel the young children would also like, the visual displays."
Incredibly moving memorial and museum,"Impressive. Quite a distance out the city, we were surprised at the size of the grounds the memorial/museum is. We were also surprised at the amount of security here and in Seoul in general but unbeknownst to us Donald Trump was in town.One of the best attractions in Korea, it was not difficult to spent hours here. I always visit war memorials and museums, humbled to be able to experience something of the wars from the perspective of others. ?We were here for around 5 hours in total, but could have stayed longer.We wandered around the outside memorials and and equipment before heading up the front steps where we were greeted by a gentleman welcoming visitors. He told us that it was a very special day and the reason for all the security was trump. He made us very welcome and gave us good information to get started.The museum is large and we really didn't do it justice. It was very sobering and moving. We also attended the Da Vinci Alive exhibition - The realm of a genius, which took up another couple of hours."
History and the Military,"This is a place that if you love history will take you all day to read, listen and take in. Children of all ages will love the vehicles, planes and other items outside. Go early and beat the crowds... it is easy to find by subway or taxi."
somber & humbling,this is another must see in s. korea... if you want to get a full spectrum view of the korean war from a slightly bias'd position please do not hesitate! its a beautiful representation and tribute to the lost and disgruntled veterans of one of our worst conflicts 
Extensive historical collection,"This is a large museum and you can easily spend a number of hours. If you don't allocate enough time you might be disappointed that you didn't get to see everything, both within the museum as well as the grounds. The displays are very captivating and is generally centered around the Korean War, but there are many elements of other historical conflicts on the Korean peninsula. This is worthy of at least a half-day visit."
"Fabulous Exhibit, well organized",At the time we were there they had a DaVinci temporary exhibit nearby. It was fascinating and we became very absorbed in the content. The statues are beautiful and capture the essence of the Korean war. Inside the museum is well organized and covers the entire history of wars in Korea. Many military artifacts. Great learning activity for teenagers.
Impressive.,One of he best! Definitely recommend if you are in Seoul. Free entrance and really full of history. Must do!
An unexpected great!,"This free musseum is great yo know the history of Korea. It has a lot of interactive areas such as various 4D cinemas and tons of vehicles, planes and weapons outside."
History and Military interests - go for it!,"I haven't been inside the museum, however, is free entrance. Outside exhibition represents a lot of militaries vehicles and airplanes! Impressive. You can even go inside some of them."
Really Well Done,"Lots of information. Lots of artifacts. Having only a general knowledge of the conflict in Korea when I went in, I felt like an expert when I came out. And the helicopters, planes and tanks...hard to believe that fit all that in central Seoul. Good place for adults and children alike."
Well worth a visit,"Really enjoyed outside and inside of this museum, and its free to enter so really worth a visit.Outside there are lots of planes, tanks and missiles displayed with some information (English and Korean) about each one. There is also a replica boat to climb on and take a look around.Inside there are a few different sections about Korea's war history. We spent some time looking around the sections about the Korean war of the 50's. Lots of information about how it started and how the UN got involved. It was a little repetative at times, with the occasional mistranslation into English, but was really interesting and enjoyable. There is a cafe inside with reasonably priced snacks and coffee. There is a restaurant and convenience store also on the site.... restaurant was reasonably priced and food was OK."
Well worth a visit,"Worth visiting, should be combined with the outdoor exhibition of airplanes and combat vehicles next to the museum (which includes things from a B-52 via a copy of a sunken ROK patrol boat to tanks) which is quite interesting as well. For the very interested, the war museum itself is huge and contains a lot (some parts of it are very detailed and technical, for example the extensive exhibition on various ammunitions and technical sensors) but other parts are more interesting for the layman, if you come from any of the many countries that participated in the UN coalition during the war you can go and find the part of exhibition showing your country’s contribution."
No.1 priority when you're in Seoul,"Definitelly a must-see place when you're in Seoul. Huge museum with lots of interesting sights, inside, as well outside of the museum."
Informative and engaging museum,A very well organised museum which fully emerges the visitor in Korea’s tortured war history. Highly recommended for all visitors to the city.
The best war museum I have ever visited,"I spent several hours here and did not come close to seeing everything before closing time. Upon arrival, you first see many memorials outside and then a huge display of military equipment on the grounds. The displays include a ship, boats, aircraft, tanks, artillery pieces, armored vehicles, and missiles spanning from the Korean War to the present day. Inside there are audio-visual displays, equipment and a wealth of other material, it can not all be seen n a single day."
Moving and informative.,"They have many great statues, monuments and military hardware outside but the main reason for going is to learn more about the Korean War. The building is large and the information comprehensive without being overwhelming. It succeeds in giving the details and facts, as well as the human and emotional side. The main thing I took away from it was understanding that as this war CAME to them, that any local over 70 in Seoul LIVED through this devastation. Sobering but important."
Excellent,"This Memorial (and museum) are incredibly done. Outdoors there are tons of old ships/planes/weapons with an explanation of each. There is a memorial wall to all those who died in the Korean war, listed by country and further by US State. Good history of Korea during different dynasties and how their armed services have evolved over time. Good coverage of other countries that helped during Korean War. Very well done. "
To cry out,I can barely read Korean but I got to read a letter from one of the soldiers and it's so heart breaking that I cried. Worth the visit. Nice to understand better Korean war. 
ok,"good general overview of Korean war. just be ready for long stay, it is really big place, expositions inside and outside."
Moving and memorable.,"The memorial outside was just as, if not more interesting than the museum inside and really highlights both the losses felt by Korea and their gratitude to nations that came to their aid during the Korean war. "
Important Visit to make ,"I have spent 3 hours there and I didn’t see everything, you can easily spend a long time there If you are interested by history.Definitely recommend the place and the English tour that will help you to understand and be more interactive than only reading."
A Very Educational Visit,I remember studying WWI and WWII in school but never recalled studying about the Korean War. It all helped to fill me in on why the Korean Peninsula is divided and why some of the relationships in Asia are a little stressed. 
Awesome! A must visit!,"This place was fantastic. They had loads of real vehicles and weapons in many previous wars on display that you can actually go right up to. There are tons of things to do inside as well dating back to the beginning of Korea all the way to present day. They have memorials to all the fallen soldiers from Korea and the UN that participated in a number of different wars. It's just a fantastic and beautiful place to visit. There are a few restaurants and cafe's to hit up while you're inside as well.It's a huge place and takes hours to see it all. Unfortunately, my visit was kind of on a time crunch and I didn't get to see everything, but I would love to go back sometime and visit again. If I could give more that 5/5 I would."
Definitely worth a visit,A comprehensive look into war history in Korea. Covers conflict from centuries back as well as the Korean War. Would return - a great learning experience. 
Great museum. Informative. Free,I learned so much about the Korean War that I did not know before. Museum was well organized and I could not believe it was free
Interesting museum,An interesting museum full of history. Plenty of things to see regarding Korea's history. Recommended.
Interesting ,"I found this museum very interesting an factual, there are tanks, planes, rockets, guns an even a boat you can look at.Inside museum it gives you detailed accounts of all the wars in koreas history, i peesonally found the korean war very interesting.There are also exhibits an stories throughout the years to read an look at.They also do guided tours, id definately reccomemd it."
History of the Korean War,"This is a free museum. You can see all the Korean War History. This museum has around8 exhibition rooms. Is closed on mondays. And the Subway line 4 or 6 will take ypu there. You can call ahead to reserve free English, Japanese and Chinese guides. Is you love museums and history you will like any museum im South Korea."
A must see in Seoul,"If you have only one day in Seoul go to this museum, if you have only one thing to do in Seoul lets it be visiting this museum, it's A MUST and visiting it will change how you see Korea and will add human values to you.If you are a citizen of one of the countries that helped Korea during its war you will feel proud of your country, you will feel more attached to Koreans and humans in general, and it will inspire you.This museum is great from the outside to inside, don't skip looking at great statues outside, they are pieces of art.The only issue I found is that the guy who volunteered to provide the English tour had a very very poor language, it was so hard to understand him."
lovely,definitely worth a visit for photos and to take in the charming environment. the war museum should be visited showcasing the Korean war and its aftermath.
Korean War Memorial and more,Learned so much more than I thought I knew. The appreciation they illustrate throughout the museum is truly incredible. The amount of suffering they went through was equally incredible. 
Worth the walk down from the station,A large and wide ranging war museum with exhibits ranging from prehistoric to the Korean War. The contemplative fountain is particularly calm. Certainly worth a visit.
Excellent place you can find the recent history of Korea!!!,The Korean War (1950-1953) changed the history of Korea and East Asia.You can find the full detail of the war. 16 countries came here to fight against the Communist attack. Its free entrance. Sure you will enjoy the museum.
Fantastic Museum,This is a great place to visit. Large museum with lots of interesting exhibits of wars over the years. Large outdoor area with many tanks and aircraft on display for you to look at and climb on. We spent all afternoon here. Free entry and easy to get to on the underground. Five minute walk from station.
Great place to wander at your own pace,This is a great way to spend some quiet time to reflect but also kids will love to explore the displays. 
A MUST VISIT,"One of the best memorials, if not the best, I've visited. I loved the 4D viewings available, opening at the start of each hour. Limited seats are available so we had to wait but it was worth it. There is also a huge area where aircrafts, tanks, missiles, boats, and other military hardware are displayed outside the main building. I learned a lot about the Koreans and how they suffered in war, thanks to this memorial. Also very accessible to visit. We took the subway from Myeondong and a few minutes walk from the subway station. I plan to go back."
Lots of history ,A very informative museum. The outside display of tanks and planes was very interesting and gave a good perspective. Inside (all free) was history of war throughout Korean history (which was very informative). The 2nd and 3rd floor was dedicated to the recent Korean conflict (1950-1953) and had informative and interesting displays and videos. We spent 2 hours there and did not see everything. A must for Americans with a connection to the Korean was (my father fought). Keep in mind it is focused on the impact of the war on the Korean people (displays in Korean and English). 
Great museum,"If the subject matter is something you're interested in, there's enough to keep you here for hours. Fascinating exhibits both indoors and outdoors. Statuary in the photo is very striking in real life."
Cool...if you have the time.,"Normal, pretty much what you'd expect, but then the anti-Trump gang came by. The anti-America came up as a surprise, but didn't deter to the tour... Mostly, those in the tour (Can, Swe, Aus, Nze, Mex) all LOVED the tour and America. I'd go right back to again learn even more...well worth the time, excellent time spent by my family of seven!"
Peace not war,there are some materials that are really shocking and the history may be forgotten but we need to remember peace.
"emotional, educational, enlightening","I spent almost 4 hours there, immersing myself in the sad history between the two Koreas. There is a comprehensive collection of exhibits and displays, which are very informative and diverse. It definitely worths a visit. And it was a highlight of my trip!"
"Exceeded all expectations, makes one strangely emotional","Every visitor to Korea should visit this place. Being the typical Korean visitor, blinded by the fashion, food and k-beauty shopping, visiting this War Memorial really opened my eyes to what South Korea is today. There are breathtaking exhibits of tanks, war planes, weapons, stunning statues, that left me in real awe of how far the Koreans have come to live the lives they have now. It is definitely beyond the average history museum. It has left me feeling strangely emotional and enlightened. Parents, this is one for the kids too. They'll love the tanks!"
Unexpected excellence,Visited with my 15 year old son who speaks English better than Korean. Richly equipped with historical artifacts and detailed descriptions. Finely supplied with foreigh language explanations.
Enlightening experience,"If you're one curious cat about South Korea & North Korea origin like us, this is a must-visit. We also spent longer that intended marvelled through all the exhibitions. I was particularly interested with the evolution of war weapons used in the earliest years, armours worn by the warriors & war strategy adopted to win the war. "
Worthwhile visit. very interesting,We visited the war memorial prior to visiting the DMZ/JCA and found it very interesting and informative. It was great to understand more about the Korean war before visiting the DMZ area. Definitely worth a visit
Excellent emotionally touching memorial and museum,"The memorial grounds are huge. I spent approx. 3 hours there, outside and inside, and inside of the museum I only visited Korean war aka UN war exhibition. It is also one of those rare museums where you can see a real B-52 bomber. Don't miss a small media presentation that tells a story about a navy conflict between South and North Korea that took place during FIFA World Cup 2002. It is not well known. It is located inside of the navy ship located in the park.I was impressed by the Memorial. Super high quality exhibition. I was also deeply touched emotionally, especially by the Monument for killed in action and by tear drop name tags room. Those of you who have been to Korean war memorial in Washington D.C. will recognize the famous phrase written here as well: ""Our Nation honors her Sons and Daughters who answered the call to defend a Country they never knew and a people they never met"". Every single name of those killed or missing in action is written here on the walls. There is a deep sense of appreciation to all those UN Coalition soldiers who ""answered the call"" and participated. I also appreciated the fact that the exhibition's main message was not a military success or a proudness in this or that. It was about a human suffering, about the war horrors and, to some extent, about a hope for the better future for both Koreas and for a harmony in the future. Very very emotional. There are a few places to get food, one is located inside of the main building and few others are outside, close to the main parking lot. There is also a museum shop inside and another shop close to the parking lot.I highly recommend a visit. 5 stars on my scale."
Amazing place for history,"As a long time history buff, I love to see military relics from various times.This place has it all.From a B52 bomber and a Russian Mig to helicopters and Chinese and American tanks, this is the place to see.Missiles and artillery round out the showcase with a boat to tour as well.It was cold and brisk for us but the onsite coffee and snack building is perfect to offset.If looking for buses don't worry.... there is a bus stop that taxis and buses stop frequently right in front of the entrance!Kids have a small playground to play on as well."
No more war,I cried realising the historical korean war... monuments and figures are perfectly crafted with symbolics and has story to tell.. most awesome..
Just a little bit of propaganda in the English translations,"Overall a very good military museum, lots of English translations. 3 floors with some very good exhibits, good details on what went on in the war.Also has modern weapons in it, so definitely ups the points."
So much history!,"Admission is free! This is a very nice museum with history dating back to B.C. with an enormous collection of things from A.C. As well as several vehicles, tanks, etc. The iron statues outside were huge and beautiful! Many local children there on a Saturday with their teachers learning the history. Most of the displays have English buttons so you can hear the stories in English. "
Very infromative,Lots of content on the 1950-53 Korean war--very informative for westerners. Other wars covered as well. Very moving!
Great free thing to do,"It was a great learning experience and something entertaining to do, and it's free! It was very well thought out and put together, wonderful things to do and see."
"War, love, relationship, community | Tribute to our fallen soldiers who fought for democracy, peace and liberty","I felt proud of my country and the rest of the world who sent troops to help South Korea protect its people. The individual names of my countrymen who fought were written and remembered. It strengthened my faith in the goodness of mankind, his search for peace, love, friendship. Our soldiers contributed to what South Korea is now with their courage and bravery, and to many, their lives. After this tour, go to DMZ for a full circle."
Very well organised and really impressive,"I am so sorry I didn't have more time to give it at least half a day. The building is huge, so clean and nice inside, with lots of original and replica exhibits, audio, educational videos, fun stuff to do and an impressive outdoor area to see all the planes, tanks, boats and whatnot. Oh, and I think the entrance was free. They also have a kids area, didn't really visit that one."
"Some wonderful exhibits, unsurprisingly a bit biased","This museum was a must visit for me - I have a different perspective as I have travelled to North Korea and visited THEIR war museum as well.I was very touched by the famous statue of the two brothers above a split globe - one South Korean and one North Korean. The main walk to the museum is under repair so you must enter from the side, I went through the left.I agree with the reviewer a few posts down that this museum paints the USA as god sent, and while the North Korean war museum was definitely 100% propaganda, this particular museum has its fair share as well, research your subject matter, see the exhibits and then make up your own mind. My favourite exhibit was undoubtedly the large Turtle Ship reimagination and replica as well as ancient battle armour and paintings.The displays are quite comprehensive and as an Aussie it was gratifying to pay my respects on the outside Australian memorial wall as well as seeing a fine collection of ANZAC displays.This museum is a must visit, keep your mind open and be aware of what you are watching, especially on the videos with energetic motivational music and short snippets of interviews.There is an area to make your own stamped and embossed souvenir postcard free of charge. Also possibly the only openly displayed DPRK flag in Seoul is on the dummy replica of the armistice signing."
Great for Learning History of the Past,It was freezing cold but there were so much to see and learn. Felt sad knowing facts of Wars. Realized how lucky we are now. Totally worth going.
Excellent. One of the most underrated museums in the world,"We spent almost two full days in this 3 story museum. It was structured chronologically and gave insights from the ancient times all the way to today's current situation.It was a lot of information, but explained in a very uncomplicated way and not only through text, but also artifacts, visuals, videos, interviews, maps and other interactive tools. It was very well structured and we actually think we know so much more about the Korean conflict and its history now. Outside you'll find a range of military vehicles, planes etc.Definitely a must-see and not doable in just one hour if you are genuinely keen on understanding South Korea's history (not just in terms of the war, but also its evolution and development economically). "
Interesting but too American,"The museum looks interesting, but it depicts the USA as the best nation in the world and tends to overlook other atrocities. There is no entrance fee and the museum is a couple of steps away from Samgakji Station. "
Great history visit,"I had no expectation when I first arrived at the museum but to my surprise, so much history to be learn there.when you enter the place, you can see these commemoratives plates, remembering the people who died during the Korean war in the 50's (by countries).it's quite an interesting visit and learning experience.You can go there on your own or with a tour agency. I spent 90 minutes there."
Go visit,Our visit here teached us a lot about the Korean war. I recommend visit if you are in the area. Free entrance.
"Tanks, canons, planes, boats and more.","I am a history buff. Since I was a kid, I really enjoyed reading things about military hardware and seeing them up close was very exciting for me. It was some sort of a Disneyland or Universal Studios for me when I went to The War Memorial of Korea. This was the first big war museum for me. I was not disappointed because they have a big collection of equipment used during the Korean War such as tanks, canons, planes and even a patrol boat at the grounds of the museum. That experience alone was satisfying enough for me and its free. Good thing my wife and daughter allowed me to have this moment. This sort of thing is more often appreciated by men and kids. After viewing and photo ops outside, we also went inside the museum. You have to get a ticket to view the entire museum inside. We decided not to buy a ticket because our time was limited. We just visited some of the collection which was free to view. We were also lucky at that time because there were some opera singers performing inside the museum and we were able to watch them for free.Going there, we took the subway (Samgakji Station). You can also take the taxi but it depends on where you will be coming from. If you want to get an appreciation of what South Korea went through and how it is preparing to defend its present and future, a visit to the Korea War Memorial is worth your while. Make sure your wife and kids agree with you first. If they do not want to go, go by yourself."
Pretty good museum.,"Pretty decent museum with exhibits of all the wars Korea has EVER been in. Nice memorial for Americans who fought and died in the Korean War broken out by the state they were from. Nice outdoor exhibit of war planes, helicopters and boats."
Excellent museum for kids too,"Spent 4 to 5 hours exploring the place. Even then did not finish the indoor section. Has a big collection (if not the biggest in the world) of actual decommissioned war vehicles from planes to tanks, ships and artillery firearms.No admission fees. The lady at the gift shop has poor attitude. The cafe serves great pumpkin latte."
Amazing!,"If I had to choose between this museum and the National Museum of Korea, I would hands down choose the War Museum! There are so many things to look at, including a 4-D type warplane simulation room. Also, there are amazing statues outside of the museum to see. This museum is not one to miss!"
"Huge, fascinating and free. The best museum in Korea.","Huge, fascinating and free. The best museum in Korea.Has great indoor and outdoor. Also children museum inside."
Wonderful museum,Go if you want a primer on Korean war history from the last 2000 years. This place is huge. Set aside a good 3-4 hours to see everything. They even have a huge collection of life size aircraft and military vehicles outside. Best of all everything is free.
Powerful Place,Very nice place to visit. Enter the museum and you will learn a lot about the history of Korea and the wars.The Collection of war machines is impressive.
must-do this is free attraction,"Not far from central Seoul, could easily be combined with other downtown sitesThe indoor exhibits were very interesting but all that walking on the marble floors got to me after a while.There is a big display of static aircraft and artillery with English translations as well. Lots of statues, and a large, quiet hall with the names of lost Korean soldiers engraved on pillars. While you are in Korea, I really recommend taking a moment to reflect"
"Good museum, interesting artefacts and info and also free entry","I had a great time at the war memorial, and could have spent a lot longer here than the 2 hours I did, if I wasn't in a rush.It's a really big place, and there was a lot of information along with all of the exhibits. I would have loved to go into the special Da Vinci exhibit as well, but it was overly expensive - not sure how long that will be there for.Unfortunately while I was there, there was a lot of work going on outside which meant that I couldn't take any decent pictures of the memorial outside, but they won't be there forever.One thing to note is that the museum is pretty out of the way, and a long walk from the centre - as are a lot of things in such a big city. I use the hop-on/hop-off buses everywhere I go, and the ones in Seoul have a stop at this museum."
Best educational tour!,It's the best educational tour I attended. The museum walked me through time and the war that happened. Learned a lot from this place
Very informative and a must-see,"It was so much more than what I was expecting and now I'm recommending it to everyone planning on visiting Seoul. Leave enough time to explore this wonderful memorial and to see the countless multimedia displays. It's well worth the visit.Added bonus is the awesome War Memorial souvenir shop just outside the main building. Really worth it. Then, please don't leaave without having a crab bagel at the upstairs restaurant.opposite the souvenir shop. Delicious.Tip: take the Metro and get off at Samgakji station. It's only a 5min walk from there"
"Educational,Worth Visiting.","This place is filled with history not just for Korea but also from different countries,it's very educational.This place is a must visit,you will really learn about the war that happened between different races,but too bad we visited around Chuseok time and between 3 or 4 PM to 5 PM,we didn't have enough time to roam around in all areas because they close early during Chuseok."
A Worthful visit at The War Memorial of Korea,"Last October 2017 me and my sister visit The War Memorial of Korea located in Yongsan-gu, Seoul. We went there via train from Myeongdong and alight at Samgakji station. The moment I saw the picture of the Statue of Brothers it mesmerized me - I am in Seoul and I need to visit it. Like many other attractions in Seoul the attraction is free. Since we stay in the bustling district of Myeongdong this is an escape from the noise and sound of the city. Though a lot of tourists are here it is very quiet and serene. The memorial is built to commemorate the victims of war and the soldiers who served to protect the nation. We entered from the left side and the Statue of Brothers will greet you which symbolizes the Korean war and below the brothers is a dome which is a mini-museum which has a crack that depicts the division between 2 Koreas and the hope for reunification. Following your track in the center is the magnificent Memorial Hall (museum) and in front are 2 separate huge statues of Korean soldiers which is totally grand and magnificent. And to your right are the vessels and artillery used in the war which includes a lifesize replica of Navy boat used in the Second Battle of Yeonpyeong, guns, aircrafts, and tanks. You could get inside the Navy boat and see from yourself the captain's deck and what's inside and outside the boat. I really enjoyed my visit because I remembered how our forefathers fought for our freedom, unity and peace. It's worth a visit."
3D 4D for free,"There is a 3D and 4D experience hereBut it only open once in a hour (and at the same time)I recommend go directly into 4D before visiting the museum. It takes quite a long time if you really look, read, watch carefully."
An important part of Korea,"The wealth of exhibits and details about the war between South Korea, North Korea, China, US totally shock me.It is not a regular museum, that have lots to read and exhibit! It has lots of interactive movie ( 4D, with movement ) fake snow, wind ...to similate the day at war! They have lots of young students onstandby to explain the various sections , exhibits and history and it is free!Enjoy your visit and vote for me if you find this review helpful!"
An amazing memorial,Not knowing very much about the Korean war this was a great learning experience. It is a very large facility you can easily spend a whole afternoon here. 
Tour of the past,"I've been to the War Memorial several times and have always enjoyed it. It is so interesting to see all of the planes, tanks and other machines outside around the museum. Inside is just as interesting. It definitely takes some time to see everything, though. It is not a place to go when you are in a hurry, unless you just walk around the outside displays. "
Excellent museum about Korean War since the founding of the nation,"C ( 17.11.30 ) I didn't expected this museum, but the museum was very good to me. There was exhibited many things about Korean War since the founding of Korea, and the various facility and weapon was exhibited. The museum was bigger than I think, and well managed. And I reminded many nation that helped Korea on Korean War. There was good place to know about Korean War for foreigner as well as Korean."
Must see,"I've been to a few war memorials, and this one doesn't disappoint. I went to the Victorious Fatherland Memorial in North Korea, so it was good to see the otherside. Note: there is a bit of bias (as one would guess), so make sure you come in and reserch anythign that seems a bit not quite.... fully discolsed"
Great history place,Here you can learn all about the korean wars and there are tours in english. Also there is a part of the museum for little children....
very interesting,"my interest was drawn on the list od those who died in the war including those from other nations who helped Korea, its a little heartbreaking but i salute the Korean government for giving utmost importance to those fallen heroes who defended its sovereignty!! another interesting areas are the hardware like airplanes, battle ships, tanks, etc displayed outside!"
Massive place,"We found the memorial to be huge, you could easily spend several hours in here. Lots of information and history. There were lockers to store your belongings and a small cafe inside too. We were surprised to find the admission was free."
One of the World's Great War Museums,"If you are a student of military conflict or are interested in Korean, far eastern, or war history, the Korean War Memorial is a must visit attraction. It's huge. Set aside a day for a visit. "
You can spend the whole day here,"This place was amazing, I can spend my whole day here going through their exhibits and watching their videos. You'll learn a lot and enjoy yourself while doing so. The visit here was also very moving."
A Must Visit ,"This war memorial is also a war museum. I give this place a 5 stars rating for its outdoor exhibits of war ship, planes, tanks, rockets, statues and the indoor photos and exhibits. The admission is free and I would strongly suggest a 3 hours tour of this place to be able to at least cover about 80 % of the place. Strongly recommended to visit; especially if you are also planning to visit the DMZ. The indoor exhibits will give you a general view of the Korean War.  "
Must go,"You have to visit this museum if you travel to Korea. It tells you how to understand today's politics in Korean peninsula. You will find out how Koreans have been fighting internally and against foreign invasions in the past two thousand years, and why they separated into two countries in the recent seventy years. Most importantly it's all free. Is you are serious, schedule a full day tour here. Note most video shows are at the beginning of the hour, important if you want to see and hear about the history."
Amazing museum/ memorial,It's on the route of the hop on hop off bus but you will need at least a half a day to see it all. Amazing park around the huge building. The park is full of war machines starting from little small motorcycle to a bomber plane and a us navy ship
"Worth your time, take your time","It is very difficult to put the value of this Memorial into words. Perhaps it is too personal, and thereby subjective. Advice: go early, commit at least 1/2 day, take your time, and enjoy."
A must see ,"This place is awesome.It was really cool to see all the planes, tanks and boats. Such interesting history and seeing the actual boat that had bullet holes in it from the most recent run in with North Korea was fascinating "
Stark reminder of the Korean wars,"The War Memorial of Korea is located in Yongsan-gu. It is a tribute to those who died in the Korean wars. The memorial was opened in 1994. The museum houses many exhibits of war in two exhibition halls. The outside has the larger weapons, while the inside houses the smaller items in six halls namely the Patriotic memorial room, War history room, Development Hall, Expeditionary Forces Room, 6•25 Korean War Room and Large Machinery Room. The museum also holds cultural events for visitors of all ages. Admission is free – but you have to pay for special exhibitions."
I learned so much!,We learned all about the Korean War. It is a beautiful memorial for all those who sacrificed. I am glad we went. We had a guide but we didn't need one. This is one museum that has a ton of English explanations and videos. It was actually distracting to have a guide. I wish we didn't have one.
Offers a good summary of what happened in the Korean War,"Not ever knowing alot about the Korean War, my husband and I spend a full morning here and thought that The The War Memorial did an outstanding job explaining why the Korean War happened, what happened, and why the current situation exists. If you have any curiosity about the Korean War at all, don't miss this Museum. Even though it does not charge for admission, we left a donation because we were so impressed with its quality."
A must visit local,Don't know much about the Korean War...You definitely must visit this Memorial. It is full of archival footage of a terrible time in the history of this wonderful country. It is nicely set up and easy to follow all the displays. You must see it for yourself.
Great info before JSA tour!,Great place to go to brush up on your korean history. We enjoyed Our short tour here before our JSA tour. The statues outside were great. 
amazing place!,very well preserved and very well kept and provides a lot of information on the Korean war. informative and wonderful place to visit
Worth the trip,"Free entrance and a very cool experience for me to visit the place and learn more about the Korean War that my grandfather fought in as a 17 year old kid. This gave me a better understanding of what happened, the Korean conflict, the USA involvement, and the sacrifices that were made. Many vehicles, tanks, planes, etc.. to see. We happily spent 2-3 hours here. I feel privileged to be able to vist this place that not so long ago was under attack."
"Amazing, A Must-Visit","This is one of the best museums I have visited, worldwide. On the outside there's a Korean War Memorial and plenty of static military vehicles (airplanes, boats, tanks, etc). On the inside, you venture through a very interactive display of Korea's history, from very early history to modern day. Many of the key Korean battles are reenacted through props, projections, and videos. It's a very large museum, so make sure you allot plenty of time explore it in its entirety ."
A must visit in Seoul,"I only gave myself 2 hours in this Museum, so I whizzed around very quickly taking in all the highlights! I would recommend at least 3 hours, if you have the time to spare. The Museum is huge and there is plenty to see and keep you occupied. A very important place to visit if you want to get to grips with Korean history. The 'War Rooms' are curated really well, lots of interactive stuff and video installations. Two 4-D cinemas and I'd really recommend visiting the artwork called The Drop. The Museum is FREE! and they also have FREE leaflets/guides in English so it's easy to navigate."
Awesome museum,Very impressive museum about the past and current conflicts in the Korean Peninsula.Outside the museum some impressive monuments are placed to remember the Korean conflict and honor the fallen soldiers.You can easily walk for hours in this amazing museum. Outside there are some war vehicles placed. The most impressive one for me was the B-52.
Good understanding on the Korean war,Comprehensive explanation of the why and how on Korea war. Good exhibits and audio- visual presentations. Free entrance to main permanent exhibits
Korean war history in a nutshell,"Free entry to well organised war museum. We went on a Sunday and it was strangely quiet. The 4D, 3D and 2D short movies were very informative. Lot of photo opportunities for real life replica of vehicles, weapons etc"
A really interesting place to visit,"We spent half a day here looking around and checking out the vehicles in the grounds, well worth a visit."
This museum / memorial is amazing,Large amount of military equipment and other exhibits. A lot of detail and history of Korea and the war. Tip: Go on Monday if you are interested in the military equipment. The main building is closed but the outdoor military equipment and memorial are open... you'll have the grounds to yourself. 
worth visit,you should spend more than two hours there.... I was there for 2 hours and I can't finish everything therethere are too many things deserve you stay and read them all. I almost cry when I read the history of Korea....I would still visit there when I visit Seoul next year!!PS. you are allowed to enter until 5pm and they close at 6pm
Plan to spend some hours here! It's worth it. ,My husband and I went here and only planned to spend 2 hours here. We needed much more time and wish we would have planned half a day here. The whole memorial is mind blowing and inspiring. Go and visit if you can. 
Very Interesting,"Definitely a place to visit! With planes, tanks, and lots of other war and military equipments on display, it's worth a look. For someone who knew little about the Korean War, the three levelled museum (free entrance) was very captivating, informative, and English-speaking friendly. There are films and a couple 4D experiences as well. We spent over two hours and only saw the displays outside and the second level. To see the whole museum I would put aside more time if you wanted to see the whole thing. Highly recommend it! "
A Great History Lesson Awaits,"Highly recommend US visitors go early during your trip to this memorial. Great materials, shows, etc. to explain the background and details of the Korean War. This visit gave us the context to understand many of the things we saw during our stay. Expansive buildings and grounds."
History of Korean War,"Outdoor exhibition of Korean War era planes, tanks, armored vehicles, ships. Both Us, Korean, Russian and Chinese. Extensive exhibitions inside including terrific audio-video presentations. Some of the best I've seen anywhere. So much to see that it is difficult to do in one day. Recommend breaking it up so as to get the most from the experience."
Outstanding Free Museum,"Everything you might want to know about the Korean War and a large inventory of tanks, planes, helicopters and even some boats outside.Recommend spending at least an hour or two."
Museum with 4D theater!,"For every trip that I take, it is a must for me to visit a museum. This museum has not disappointed me at all. At first, I was amazed by how vast the area is and the outside area looks very clean. What amazed me though was the 4D theater! There is no entrance fee in this museum and yet I was able to experience it.It's a great way to learn about war and the not so good things that come out of it."
Must visit in Seoul,"Apart from Kpop, Kdrama and smartphones, Sokor is known for one of the most brutal and deadly civil war in history, the Korean War in 1950-53.This museum gives special emphasis and showcases the gallantry of the south as well as their gratitude to the other nations who threw their support to their cause. This is best shown by the display of colors/flags of these nations. I was just disappointed though that their records dont bear the names of soldiers who were lucky enough to go hom alive as my grandfather did. They do pay special homage to those who laid down their lives helping a neighbor repeal their brother's invasion.On display on its sprawling grounds are military relics and weaponry through the years. A trip to this museum before or after going on a DMZ tour is highly recommended for further context to understanding the Korean conflict. "
Impressive Museum,"I would definitely put this on your too do list. It not only has a focus on the Korean war but also in depth look at battles fought over the past 1500 years.There is no entry fee for this exhibit, but donation boxes are located on site. Very close to the train station and the National Museum."
Very thorough museum on korean war,"I normally don't like these types of museums much but with such a high TA rating, I figured I go. I liked the outside exhibits of the tanks and airplanes the most. They also have a boat that got shot up. I did not find the inside of too much interest but I don't have alot of interest in korean war. There were many exhibits though so if you do have interest in the wars of korea, this is definitely the place"
Very impressive ,"You can easily spend 2-3 hours between the exhibits and outdoor equipment displays. Especially liked the B-52. The exhibits cover a lot of Korean military history from ancient times. Non-native visitors will likely find the 2nd level (what Westerners refer to as the Korean conflict) the most interesting. If you're pressed for time or not a hardcore history nerd, see that area first before venturing further."
great,the very first thing to do when you in Seoul. It is all free so really a must try. highly recommend froe everyone
Blew me away!,"The museum was undergoing renovations and wasn't opened when I visited, but the display of the old artillery, tanks, guns, missiles and aircraft really was something not to be missed. From P51 Mustang, a Phantom fighter jet to an actual B52 Bomber on display, my son and I were simply in awe for the 2 hours we were there. Pity the museum wasn't opened. I'll be sure to come back again the next time I'm in Seoul.Oh, the pun in the title was really unintended..."
"Impressive, moving sight",Even if you don't visit the (free) memorial museum. the vast esplanade that surrounds it is well worth seeing. The engravings of the role call of those that died from all the nations involved is very moving. The actual memorial is very impressive and stands at the main gate.
One for the nerds - so it's lucky that I qualify ...,"Lots of history here, and not just what we Westerners call ""the"" Korean war.Well laid out exhibitions, and something for every nerd.A little heavy handed on the ""we wuz robbed"" view of history, with plucky Korea continually being buffeted by ill-thinking foreigners. Then again, I guess that isn't so far from the truth."
Well worth a visit,This excellent museum really has some accessible displays that really help one to understand the Korean war and th struggle of the Korean people. I also really enjoyed the the historical section on the lower floors. The volunteer guides are really helpful too.
Weapons weapons weapons,"If you like military stuff and you are mainly interested in weapons of all kinds starting with a real B52-D Bomber and other aircrafts, tanks, missiles etc then this is the place to visit. I was hoping to get more insights into the historical aspects why the wars were actually started, but got rather disappointed. It's more about the who and how instead of the why (in contrary to the War Remnants Museum in HCMCity). Still recommended to visit."
A different take on the Korean War,"We all learn about the Korean War (a little anyways) in high school history class. To us it is always that little thing in between WWII and Vietnam. This museum is really good at demonstrating that the Korean War was a war of survival for the people of South Korea. It also takes a different view of a lot. Americans seems to always view it through the lens of ""and then we save South Korea,"" whereas they view it as a war of survival in which others aided them. It also gives a really good idea of the international involvement. Ultimately a ""must see"" when visiting Seoul."
A reminder to choose peace,"A place to be reminded why we should choose peace. Expect to be teary eyed specially at ""the drop"". Watching and learning the different stories of heroes, kindness and selfless acts despite the ugliness of war would also restore your faith in humanity.Tip: start with the top floor; wheelchair accessible; multilingual materials available; free entrance"
Well Worth visiting,"This could b a whole days activity if u like the history of any wars that Korea has been involved in. I went because my father was a Korean War Veteran but it has three stories of history of Korean wars back to 16 BC. It has a big display of military vehicles that children can get into eg planes, tanks and a big ship. It has a children's museum as well. Well worth visiting. U could take lunch and sit in the gardens to eat."
Good museum,"It was good because throughout the museum, it gave lots of information in details how, where, when and why. The displays were good and fascinating, we were spending abt 3 hrs there and watched 2 short video in Eng, a 3D rides, looking at the guns, tanks, jets, and lots. The boys loved to feed the fishes ($1000won put in the box to get a bag of popcorns), and looking at the jets plus the museum is free entry."
Amazing,This is a very nice museum with multiple floors. Make sure that you allow yourself plenty of time as this could easily take up an entire day. You may want to get a tour as doing it by yourself can be overwhelming. 
Interesting thing to see,"We had nice visit to this memorial, know more about the war between the north & south Korea a half century before. Many war weapons. Good chance to learn about the war."
Worth the trip!!!,"More of a museum than a memorial, but it does not matter.Fascinating and emotionaly moving site everybody should visit when in Seoul. Admission is free, the visit takes about 2 hours and the exhibits are just...impressive."
Brought the Korean War to life,"Large collection of old and current planes/tanks/artillery outside and 3 floors of exhibits inside. We just Ed did the Korean War level. Lots of videos as well as items, all in English as well as Korean. Clearly and well explained the background and details of the war"
An Enlightening Experience,I truly believe that the War Memorial of Korea is a must visit location when visiting Korea. Being from a western country where war has not been waged in my country for over 150 years (Canada) it was an experience to see what Korean people have gone though for many years. And this place is free to visit!The museum focuses on war from ancient times to modern times. There are some great exhibits on the Japanese occupations and wars of Korea. but the real highlight is the modern wars. Learning and knowing the suffering that the Korean people have gone through and how far they have come from being so poor after war to where they are now is amazing. It is also good to remember that they are constantly being threatened with war again and again even today. There are many old pieces of machinery outside and there are even a few you can go inside. These are great to see up close and feel these huge machines. I really do recommend everyone to visit this location when they are in Seoul.You can check out this and other attractions like the National Museum of Korea on our website at the link in my profile.
Interesting look at war in Korea,"On my first visit, I mistakenly believed that it was a museum dedicated to the Korean War. It's actually a museum to all war in Korea, of which there has been no small amount. From stone tools to the Gulf invasions, it covers most everything. "
Unbelievable Scale and Incredible Breadth,"The War Memorial is a vast landmark that speaks volumes to the measure of feeling South Koreans have related to not only the unfinished war and all that came before and after it. The grounds alone could occupy you for over an hour and the inside could keep you busy all day. Not only does it include the three exhibits related to the Korean War, the third and final being a moving homage to the nation's who answered call to aid ""people they never met and a country they never knew"", there are also numerous exhibits on Korea's older history, including the Joseon Dynasty, the Japanese occupation and other special exhibits that change regularly. For any of the culturally curious or historically fascinated, this is an absolute must in Seoul. "
Chand,"Went here in Sept. 2017. Was a memorable experienceLovely well maintained gardens.Well laid out. Loved Indian and Great Britain areas. Would definitely recommend everyone visiting Seoul to go. I did not want to leave,it is very pleasant feeling to stay longer."
Very very big,"There's a lot to read about the Korean War.. A LOT to read. I nearly everything, but it feels like physically walking through a textbook. Some of the information repeats itself a lot thoughout the museum, but it isn't presented in interesting new ways to make you want to re-read it. The outside has some neat pieces, like the clock that will be installed at the time of reunification. The 4D movies inside are refreshing, and the historical models look nice as well. Overall not many high points for how long you will spend here. Wouldn't go again or recommend to friends, but to each his own"
A Truly Great Experience.,"I was impressed. The was it was set up, the sprawling complex was breathtaking. I especially love the collection of aircrafts. Watched the 3D movie, learned a thing or two about the Koreans sense of duty and their devotion in defending their motherland. Great experience!"
Stunning Tribute Musuem,Incredible collection of military artifacts dating back to the early medieval period. Exhibits are well layed out and varied and the grounds outside the musuem house a nice collection of vehicles. Did I mention it's free?
Not a Boring Museum,"The place is huge! My family and I didn't get to explore all the floors because we arrived there at around 2 in the afternoon and every floor got interesting memorabilia and history that it might really take a while before you move on to see another section. At the ground floor, by the way, is the imposing turtle ship (not the original one) made famous by Admiral Yi Sun-shin. If you haven't yet seen the movie, ""Roaring Currents"", watch it and you'll see how the turtle ship made an appearance there. =)At around 5:00, we decided to skip the other remaining top floors and head out to check the war ship docked outside the museum and the fleet of war planes and tanks. It was so cool, really.There's so much to see in this place and so much awe-worthy historical war items. My country was a part of it too (during the Korean War, them and the Koreans were allies) so it's really heartwarming to see that our soldiers are not forgotten. ^_^"
The War Memorial of Korea : Best Place near Iteawon,"The War Memorial of Korea: Best Place near Itaewon-Best place near Seoul to see the history-Entry is Free of cost-Explore the history about South Vs North Korea-Lot of old weapons, fighter planes, Tanks, and ships.-Don't miss the 3D video about the war history-Near to Metro/Subway station, 5 minutes walk.-3-4 Hours are good enough to see the museum"
Great museum,"This is a fantastic museum. Presents a good view of the Korean War, with heavy emphasis on the participation of other countries. Exhibits are in English, and there is a multilingual app available for other languages. Definitely worth a visit when staying in Seoul.  "
If you love history...,"We visited this place because we were with my brother-in-law and he may be interested in this museum. During our visit, there was a field trip of little kids, and they were all adorable. There are fighter planes and jets outside the museum, which would catch your interest. Inside the museum, there are different areas that would touch your interests."
You should visit ,Great place to visit the war museum done very well very big place with slot of thing to see and learn about that war in Korea in easy enjoyable way 
Landmark of world war history ,"I visited in company of friends this war museum and was amazed to see planes, vehicles, war ship etc used in the Korean War. The history is documented in every little space in the museum, and can be a source of information for both military historians and other people who are interested.You need to spend some hours in this monument whenever you visit Seoul."
Huge and interesting place,"This is a huge place so you will need to spend here at least 2 hours. The exhibitions are well explained, the building is impressive and the entrance is free. Easy to access by subway. If you would like to learn more about the Korean war, this is the place to go. If you are not into that you will find this place boring. In my opinion, this is a place you must visit while in Seoul."
Korean War History Leason!,"Sure, outside is where you take all the selfies and Instagram moments. But it is inside where you will learn all about the wars that South Korea has fought in. The War Memorial is a very big place. Make sure you get a free brochure so you know where the 7 indoor exhibits are. There are numerous artifacts, and war documents. Be prepared to a few hour here or all day. Tips:Admission is free."
Wonderful experience for war history lovers and military learners,"The biggest war museum and memorial hall in Seoul.Great for visitors who are interested in the history, especially on wars and military exhibitions.- Accessible from metro Samgakji or Noksapyeong station. Or buses.- Free entrance.- 2~3 hours to watch slowly.- Outdoor museum has aircrafts, artilleries, vessels, tanks, missiles, choppers, etc. The replica of patrol vessel, PKM-357 engaged in 2002 is allowed to enter. Some landing vehicles, too.- In memorial hall, visitors can take a tour to 1st, 2nd and 3rd floor. There are many items of Korean military history as well as Korean War.- Materials of United Nations engaged in Korean War.- Multimedia rooms.- There is a large square outside the memorial hall and it's nice to relax."
A gem in the historical heritage of South Korea,"The War Memorial of Korea is a marvelous establishment to visit. Everyone visiting Seoul should visit this memorial and remember the sacrifices our fellow women & men made to keep this world safer. The exhibits are really impressive and they have taken care of each item with utmost attention. They have honored all the countries supported South Korea in the Korean War and remember their contribution of all the philosophy South Korea stands for. Do visit, entry to this memorial is free and you can enjoy the Armed Machinery exhibits in the grounds. Cheers,BokaBoy"
A good history lesson ,"Growing up on US and European history, the war memorial provided a lot of insight into Korean and Asian history that was missing from my knowledge bank. It was interesting to walk around, I would allot a few hours for this memorial before continuing to tackle wandering around Seoul. "
Learned a lot about the Korean War,"We spent 2-3 hours walking through the museum and military equipment. Read stories about the heroic actions during the war and learned a lot more about the history before and during the war. It was Free, so very worth it."
Great learning experience,I wasn't to keen on going here but I'm glad I did. It's not just about the recent war but all wars in the history of Korea. I found the outdoor exhibits most interesting. Real planes and tanks from the war were neat to see. Lots of school children on tour here when we went. Very accessible from samgakji station...just a short walk away.
Historical,"The War Memorial of Korea (전쟁기념관) is a beautiful and modern museum dedicated to the history of the Korean War. One of my favorite aspects of the museum was when you walked up because they had all of the flags of the countries displayed and have a hallway with the list of names of every soldier, from every country, who fought and died to defend South Korea during the war. I was only here for less than an hour as a pit-stop with my tour group on our way to the demilitarized zone but from those around me, I heard that it take around 3 days to see everything inside of this massive museum. If you are very interested in the Korean War, this would be a great place to see. There is also free admission."
Interesting ,I went here with my husband (then bf) about a year ago and I loved it. It's very interesting with all the history and it's huge!
Intestering place to visit in Seoul,"A good place to enjoy Korean history. Some real models of old war machine: ariplanes, tanks, APCs, cannons, etc. Best of all, it is free of charge."
Great way to learn history of the Korean War- a must visit!,"If you want to know why South Korea is the South Korea it is today, visit this museum! I recommend going when they have a free tour in English- it is always helpful to have someone guide you through and tell you the most pertinent parts of the museum. After you can go through again and see anything you may have passed by. "
A must go if you are in Seoul! - Great museum. Very informative and interesting - And free!,"If you are in Seoul and have a few hours to spare, this museum has to be the greatest place to learn about the troubled history of this divided nation.The place is huge and you can easyly spend several hours looking at the exhibits and installations. There are loads of audio-visual exhibits too. You can see, that they really put huge efforts into making this place as interesting and informative as possible.The museum is divided into an outside and an inside part. Outdoors there is a huge collection of tanks, planes, and other vehicles from both sides. Including a 1:1 replica of the PKM-357, a South Korean vessel, sunken by the North in 2002. The bullet hole riddled hull will remind you in an impressive way, that these two countries are actually still at war to this day.On the inside there are loads of Installations and exhibits describing the whole conflict between the South and the North (and their respective Allies)."
"Very interesting, clean and friendly ",This is a great museum. The whole complex is so clean and the people are friendly. Interesting that there's no charge. There's much to do so plan a whole day. It was interesting to see that the country's in this region have been at war on and off for thousands of years. Like the Middle East and Europe. Kind of sad the no one ever figures out the was isn't accomplishing anything. 
Great overview of the Korean War,"I took the free English tour of the museum. Our guide was a little hard to understand but having her show us around was invaluable. One my own, I wouldn't have stopped to watch the short films, but I found them to be great at explaining the war and I am glad they were part of the tour. The guide mentioned several times how the UN soldiers saved S. Korea from the North and the gratitude and appreciation to the soldiers who fought for a country they didn't know was truly humbling. "
Important place to visit ,Tis is a very interesting place to visit. Both from the historical point of view and for the exhibition.
Simply Impressive!!!!,"Initially, when my cousin recommended paying a visit, I was a little skeptical..... However, we ended up spending close to 2 1/2 hours walking through the grounds!!!!! It was simply amazing.. almost to the point of information overload!!!! Being an Air Force brat, i have to say it brought back some old-time memories... but enough of memory lane.... The memorial would be a great trip.. as adults.. and especially if their kids invovled....the displays were impressive... from the displayed text for each of the artifacts.. to the interactive monitors/displays... it was extremely fascinating...... The memorial covers a fairly large extensive time-period!!! it is definitely a must see!!!!"
History and Tribute....,"There are not enough words to express how amazing and heartwrenching the War Memorial is. I think everyone should experience the journey through a war most people have limited knowledge of...but one which had/has a worldwide impact even today.Phenomenal internal design and display layout. Planes, tanks, boats, and military equipment to explore.Monuments and statues that pay honor to military and civilians alike.Displays and videos are in several languages, including English.Ohhh...and did I mention...FREE admission.O"
A pleasant surprise,"Visited this museum as we had seen the one in Pyongyang, which tells a different version of events. Heaps to see and ended up staying a few hours browsing. The outside area is good fun as you can poke around military vehicles. If your in the area the American quarter is nearby for cradt beer. We walked it in 20mins."
Worth it if you have time,"It was a very interesting memorial. It was filled with exhibits that touched on many different aspects of the war. It also had videos and 3 dimensional replicas and real souvenirs from the war, so it was constantly entertaining."
Excellent place to learn some history,"I wasn't sure what to expect but the war memorial does not disappoint. First, the place is huge. You will need 3+ hours to tour it. We spent an hour just outside of it looking at all the military hardware used during the Korean war and there is a small gunboat outside that was sunk in 2005. You get to go in it (it's a replica) and see the story behind it. Inside the war memorial, there are exhibit showcasing the story of the Korean people. Each floor is for a different period. the second floor shows the ""recent"" war of 1950. It's very chilling to see what happened. Overall I recommend it for everyone."
When the different nations come together to protect democracy,I was hesitant to come due to an aversion to anything that pertains to wars but my husband really wanted to see it. I came away with some dread regarding our future as it appears that not much has changed especially with all the posturing by North Korea happening while we were there. But it also gave me hope that the human race will again come together to oppose their aggression as they have before. 
The place to go for details on Korean War!,"A poignant memorial to commemorate the horrible war.Information and exhibits are very well displayed and informativeSituated near the city centre, it is easy to get to.Suggest spending 3hrs there for a comprehensive visit."
How records speak volumes,In a flash the museum provides much needed information about South Korea and its history. It is a must see site for every visitor to The Republic of Korea
An emotional experience,"We weren't really sure what to expect. The amount of aircraft on display was amazing. There is a ship outside by the aircraft with a great story of heroism. Make sure to catch the quick movie inside the ship. Once inside, the museum seems endless. It was emotional to see all of the hardships the South Korean people have been through. Definitely a must see while in Seoul."
Incredibly interesting. Definately a must do in Seoul.,"Definitely a must do if in Seoul. The English guided tour was incredibly worthwhile and I came away knowing so much more about the recent history of Korea which made it even more amazing to see how the country had advanced in a very short period of time. It also made my visit to the DMZ and JSA much more meaningful having this background. Even if you're not really a museum person, you will enjoy this museum."
The War Memorial of Korea to understand war history in Korea,"Nice and calm museum to understand war history in Korea. It's free admission. I've been many times with my kid. There is nice cafeteria for coffee & cookies in building. If you are lucky, you can see traditional wedding for real couple in the garden side. They have combat plane and tank for view. It's good to walk around regardless of weather."
My best ever museum,"I've seen hundreds all over the world, but nothing like this. So many exhibits (including a B52 or a military ship or plenty of other weapons), so much history from so many angles, so much multimedia including in English, free entry and free wifi. Spent 3 hours there, and could have easily spent more.Way above expectations. Must see."
MUST GO. PERIOD.,This is definitely a must go place when you visit Seoul. Free entry to the musuem and IT IS HUGE with heaps of exhibition halls! You could easily spend 3 - 5 hours should you wish to explore most of the exhibitions.It is closed on every Monday and there are free guided tour provided in different languages at a different time slot.
A Must do in Seoul,"We have visited many war memorials and museums around the world including Auschwitz, Gallipoli, Long Tan and Monte CassinoThis rates very well amongst them as a place to visit and the Koreans have done it very well and spared no expense in doing it properlyThere is a whole floor dedicated to Korean history. Another two floors dedicated to the Korean War and the role of the UN in that war. Outside is an impressive display of military hardware as well as the memorial itself which recognises not only the South Koreans who died but all of those nations that fought alongside themAllow a minimum of three to four hours for your visitEntry is free but donations are accepted. I will guarantee that once you have been through you will be sure to want to make a donation"
Highlight of Seoul,"This was our most favorite spot in Seoul. Not only did we learn about the Korean War and appreciate peace and understand how such a great nation has become, we also enjoyed the beautiful landscape, architecture and sculptures. The English tour was especially great."
"Come for the guns, stay for the propaganda","I've been to several of these War Memorials around Southeast and East Asia. The War Memorial in Seoul is no different from the other flawed sites. It's more like a graveyard for old military equipment (MiG-21, F-4 Phantom, trainer aircraft, assorted tanks), but also has its share of propaganda on the loudspeakers. And just for kicks, even the mothballed ICBMs at the Memorial are facing due north. "
Amazing museum with a fantastic tour,Whether you're interested in military history or not the War Memorial of Korea is not to be missed. The museum offers free tours regularly through out the day with friendly and knowledgeable guides. The displays are detailed and you come away having learnt a lot about the history of Korea and how it's become what it is today.
Amazing place,"My first trip to the Memorial was way too rushed, so I'm going back today to enjoy it more fully. The museum is amazing detailing all the wats that Korea has struggled through for the past 2,000 yeats. The displays are excellent and there is sooooo much to see. Give yourself a half day minimum to take it sll in!"
Fascinating and Well Assembled - A Must!,"To understand current Korea, you must understand the wars that made current Korea. This is the place to get that understanding. An impressive facade gives way to great exhibits that will fascinate you (yes, even those on ancient battles). Exhibits are well put together, multimedia and informative. Outside, there is a host of planes, tanks and boats - all fun to see. I loved seeing many Korean families here with their children, carefully explaining things to them. Take the subway and spend at least 3 or so hours."
Amazing !,Only other war museums that I have been to that compare are Canberra - Australia and Ho Chi Minh - Vietnam. This one has everything - if you love history allow 4 hours if your a skimmer then 2 hours. They have free English guide would recommend this very informative. Great outdoor section with planes and ships. Very well done and beautiful garden/building. They even have a 3D survivor story which was great. 
"Very nice, a bit to overwhelming","The place offers a great getaway from hot summer days. It is a nice place with a strong meaning (a bit too strong for my taste). There is a collection of war instruments in the backyard (vehicles, planes, ships, ...). Inside a great presentation of the Korean war is displayed in a nice way with great impact."
Great Museum. Highly Recommend,"First wonderful grounds to walk around that includes military aircraft, tanks, and artillery. Then on to the museum. Free admission and a free book as well! I thought it would just be about the Korean War; however, it was actually a wonderful surprise to go through the entire history of Korea. A great variety of exhibits,very informative, and the staff was friendly as well. Highly recommend you include this in your visit."
A Forgotten History,"It is a very good museum to understand the history of Koryo division. Although it from one side opinion, but it gives you a clear and bigger picture of the event. Well maintained museum, and it's free, audio tour also available, and for the children there is a playground at the back of the war arsenal yard. Been here several times, and I strongly recommend for visitors to come to the museum. And so they know that KOrea is not only about Halyu and K Pop."
"Very interesting, great wifi, and great place to relax a little.","I actually was in Itaewon and decided to take a walk, and I stumbled into the back entrance of this museum in the garden area. I had wanted to go anyway, so it was a pleasant surprise! The museum itself is quite large, so if you're really into seeing everything the place has to offer, you'll need to plan to spend a few hours there. I really enjoyed the exhibits and learned a lot for sure. The air conditioner was also absolutely lovely, and there's a refreshing little cafe downstairs where I bought some ice cream in between exhibits. The wifi is also great, especially since I didn't yet have a SIM card at the time so I was navigating a little bit blindly. Overall it's a really nice place and you'll learn a lot. I especially recommend going if you want to learn about the Korean war in detail, or are doing research. They were even giving out free books at the entrance with very detailed information on the Korean war that would be extremely useful for research purposes. The entrance to the museum itself is also free, they just take donations. So go, relax, learn, and have a nice time :D"
Amazing,"Great museum abouy Korean war history from the hunting and gathering era till the Vietnam War. From 4D to holograms, this museum captivates you with high quality story telling!"
Thoroughly Enjoyable,"Even if military history is not your cup of tea, I would definitely recommend a trip to this museum. It is very extensive and interesting with a range of displays and artefacts both inside and out. Leave yourself plenty of time to explore the museum. Best of all, it is free of charge!"
War museum. ,"If you are interested in Korean War, it is worthy to visit. The garden is also very beautiful. "
Great Historical Museum,"I probably spent at least 3hrs just looking at things and I'm not one that is into history. Be sure to have time to go outside. Lifesize airplanes, tanks, etc...really neat and you can step onto them. Would definitely recommend it. Easy to get to by metro."
Free and informative,"I would definitely recommend a visit to this museum while in Seoul. First of all, it's free! It's a huge museum that would probably take a few visits to really see everything. I took the English tour and that helped get some extra insight, but you could definitely just wander around by yourself. Great place to learn more about the Korean war as well as Korean history."
maybe the best place to learn about the Korean War,"I went there only for the Korean war, but this museum also about wars in ancient times. If you want to learn about every detail of the Korean war, it takes you 4-5 hours at least.The design is very good. There is a lot of interactive media for you to learn. There are also 4D and 3D movies available. From the museum, I can tell Koreans are grateful for those countries who helped. Outside the museum, there are wreaths dedicated to different countries. There is an exhibition room introducing what each country did at the war. At the entrance, you can get an English book for free about the everyday progress at the war.They even have a veteran volunteer. You can take pictures with him."
Very worthwhile,"Learn about how Korea took shape as a nation and of course the Korean War. Easy access by Metro, spend 2 hours or so here"
Great place to take the kids and learn,"The Korean War memorial was an outstanding experience.Took both my kids here during our stay in Seoul and it's a huge place. So many things to see & interact with here.Lots of history regarding Korea as a Nation and its culture. So many beautiful sculptures and historical artifacts and models dating back thousands of years.You could spend the whole day here and try to absorb it all but with 2 kids in tow, it wasn't meant to be.They have daily tours here so best to research and book yourself a tour as we just ended up going on our own. I think the tour would offer more insight into the museum.You can select the preferred languages in different sections/parts of the museum (where applicable) so that no one misses out on all the informaiton rather than staring at stuff not knowing what the h*ll it is).A great place to learn & educate yourself of Korea and its history."
Very Well Done!,"First off, it's free! Second, it is very well laid out.Third, free lockers to store your stuff.Fourth, we found it was just fine doing it on our own without a guide. All the exhibits and such are in in English so we had no problems following the history of the war. And it is great history! I had no idea why, how, and such the war began and where it is today (just a cease fire). If you are in Seoul, this is a must visit. You will learn many things about how it began, the US involvement, the UN involvement, etc. We took the subway and once outside it was a short walk around the corner to the museum. There are same great statues out front and lots of military hardware on the one side. Again, an excellent museum that is not too crowded and very well laid out and easy to understand."
Must visit,We absolutely loved the place! We engaged an English speaking guide who we met at the lobby at 10am - he was very courteous and came across as quite knowledgeable. Its a very interesting place to visit esp.to soak in Korea's historical background. Children will find the displays outside very exciting. 
I liked it.,First of all the place is huge. Expect to spend over 2 hours there. I think it is worth the time. There's lots to see and I found it quite interesting. I would definitely recommend going.
Thoughtful and respectful,"I've been to a lot of Peace Museums around the world and this may be the best. The building itself honors the military subject matter within, yet has a quiet peacefulness with fountains, spacious halls and the flags of many nations who helped during the moment of crisis for Korea. Our English tour guide covered the sequence of events well and stayed within the one hour tour time. She was professional, interesting and gave multiple perspectives. English signage was everywhere so everything was understandable. At the end, they gave away a book that covered the day by day accounts of the events of the war. That was big for my husband who will want to continue to study the details of this war. Definitely worth your time to come for a visit."
Nice Museum,"Went to the war memorial and museum last week. There is a lot of Korean history contained in the 3 floors of the museum, dealing with the military aspects of the country from its inception through the present, with about half the space dedicated to the Korean War. Most of the signs are in both Korean and English, and tours are available in both languages. There is parking available, but we actually walked there, so I couldn't price it for you. The museum itself is free. It took my wife and I about 3 hours to go through the museum, walking slowly and reading most of the signs. We didn't sit through any of the movies. There is of course a gift shop and cafe in the museum."
A great place to learn about history of Korean war,This place is close to my home and I have visited there several times. It has both free and paid exhibition halls. You can learn a lot about Korean war history as well as about its allies. You can easily get there from Samgajki station Line 4 and 6. This place is close to Seoul Station. There is a pond and fountain outside. I highly recommend to visit this place. If you are taking Seoul City Bus tour. There is a stop here.
Excellent museum,Very informative museum. Lots of detailed exhibits.We stuck to modern history and it took us ~3 hrs.Gardens /memorials outside were also very impressive.
Very Moving,I visited the museum with a group of American Korean War Veterans and found the experience very moving. The museum describes the war in a chronological order and displays some of the weapons used. The Bed Check Charlie brought back memories for some of the Veterans in our group.
Great musuem,Large museum with in and outdoor exhibition. Great place to visit while in Seoul to learn about history of the korean war. The exhibitions are well laid out and easy to navigate. A lot of reading to do though. I spent nearly 3 hours there. I personally don't appreciate this kind of topic but I'm glad I paid a visit.
Beautiful and touching,"Wonderful and large with lots to see in the museum, which is free. The memorial also has a huge display of tanks and planes, etc from the war. A must see."
38th parallel ,"Took a half day tour to the border that divides South and North Korea. Lots of history to see along the border we had four stops and each of them is historic. One of the place we visited is an Infiltration Tunnel that the North built to cross the Southern part. We went a Train Station that used to service the Korean Peninsula, and there's a hill where one can view the Northern part with their Flag flying high. Very educational trip altogether."
You must visit.,"First, you can take what you want of photos inside and out and there is a lot to photograph.Second. It is free.Third. You need 5-6 hours and can easily spend a whole day there.This is a war memorial and war museum, not only about the ongoing war. It is also about wars in Korea in general many ages back in time. Of course, as usual, it turns out to be more about glorification of war than horrification. That is the downside of history in museums, when you try to explain it in a museum the bad times and horror look like adventures. So people never really learn how bad it was. Anyway, this place is a must to visit in Seoul."
Interesting if you're into this kind of thing,I'm not a huge war fan. In fact I hate it so this place did not appeal to me. But it is interesting and well laid out. So if you're interested in the military I would recommend visiting. Entry is free and the exhibitions are displayed in multiple languages.
An Interesting Look at the Korean War.,This is a large enough museum to spend a couple of hours at least. There are displays of the weapons and equipment from the war as well as a chronology of the three years of conflict. The signage is in English so I had no trouble with the information on any of the displays. I did find it interesting that it is definitely from a Korean point of view. A few times it seemed like the Koreans had just invited NATO along for the ride as they won the war! It is a must see for anyone interested in war history.
a must visit,This memorial provided a vast background and history of South Korea. An enjoyable tourist attraction one should visit. 
"If you have only one place to visit in Seoul, come here","I typically do not spend time writing reviews for attractions, but this place blew my mind off.I am SO glad to have stumbled upon this place on the internet, since it wasn't one of the heavily advertised places when coming to Korea, as opposed to Namsan Tower, the palaces and etc. I set off slightly before lunch, and walked around the memorial halls. Take note, that you can spend the whole day here if you want to (or at least half a day) because there is so much to do. The only downside is that the food options here are really limited, there was a cafe but everything was sold out except drinks. And the convenience store outside only had cup noodles, so I decided to walk out nearby to have my lunch. If you are stuck like me, do check out Tama Pasta (opposite the route when walking back to Samgakji station). I believe it is on 1~20 Itaewon-ro. You won't miss it. They have really nice set lunches there!With each increasing floor (there are 3Fs in total), the emotions grew heavier on me. The first floor was the history and formation of Korea, second was the Japanese occupation and so on, and the third floor was specially dedicated to the UN. The amount of people that sacrificed for the sake of reunification and peace is immense, including the UN soldiers whom selflessly risked their lives for an unknown people. And if you like what you see, I recommend that you visit the UN Memorial Cemetery in Busan, where some of the bodies of the UN soldiers were cremated.There was another section on the third floor that was under construction, so do take note of that. It will only finish constructions in December. Aside from that, the war memorial has nothing but praises. Not only is the admission free, they have some activities too including several 4D theatres that you can view the shows. There was also a cinema airing different movies throughout the day which I did not get to enjoy, but I most definitely will go back another day. That does not include the outdoor exhibitions that is outside the exhibition halls, but it was too hot today to explore so that will be sufficient for another visit. Beside the information counter, there was a counter of free books (not old, torn or tattered but perfectly new books) on Korea that anyone can take. I took an English copy and am very glad.I beg to differ that if you have visited DMZ, you should not visit this place. Precisely because you have visited DMZ, you should come to the war memorial as it has comprehensive information about the Korean War that the DMZ may not have covered. If you have ONE day in Seoul, and dying to know more of Korea (and North Korea), do visit this underrated war memorial. You will not regret spending your time there. And, don't forget to put in a donation as well if you can to continue this place! ;)"
Wow.,"I normally get bored fairly quickly in museums, but this was great. Best museum I have ever visited! Loads of stuff to do and see. I learnt a lot about south Korea. Would be great for family's too. Only issue is that it closes early compared to the other museums in Seoul so we didn't get to see it all! Also it's free! But I would have happily paid to get in."
Interesting,"A real highlight at how ridiculous war is. Unfortunately it is of course not a particularly accurate account or any information about what Korea actually means when it says it wants to be re-unified. An exercise in celebrating the Korean military. Fair, but not for an accurate history lesson."
Great museum!,"Beautiful museum inside and outside (make sure to explore outside as well). There is so much to go through - you could easily spend 1 day in there. Everything is so well thought of. There are different sections and I recommend that you take the pamphlet and go through each section in the recommended order to have a much better understanding (some of the info may seem a bit biased though but that would make sense). There are also 4D films. We went to one of them and had to line up. It's not that great if you're looking for a thrilling ride but kids will enjoy it. They usually run hourly and last under 10 min but when we went on a Friday, they ran it every 15 min as of 4PM I believe, because there were a lot of people. Note that the museum closes at 6PM and they start pushing people to leave at 5:45PM :P"
Visit The War Memorial of Korea (64th anniverary of armistice),"Nice place to visit for undestanding the background of war and how much we owed to the people who served and sacrificed to protect Korea.Also giving lessons for today.Open daily 09:00~17:30 (close on Monday), free entrance.English, Japanese, Chinese guide available (10:00 am, 2:00 pm)Close to Exit No. 12 at Samgakji Station by Metro #4 & #6.Also many bus lines."
Best war museum I've been to.,"Very interesting museum, huge amount of armaments on show in the grounds and museum itself (lots of planes, tanks, guns, and a boat - even has the first MiG that the Uwest got it hands on from defecting north korean.) Interesting content, esp korean war aspect, relatively unbiased and very informative. Best war museum I've been in!"
very moving and poigniant,a very moving and poigniant memorial to this tragic and still on going conflict.Well worth a visit .This is an often forgotton conflict for Brits which is very sad
knowing deeper about South Korea,"What a great museum, big place and the i can say its one of the most great historical collection stuff in Asia, with a good condition and display. You can take subway to reach there, just a short distance from station. In the entrance gate/lobby, just find the brochure with the map, and follow the map. this museum is tourist friendly, you can find English Chinese and Japanese letter so dont worry about that. there are some mini theater and you can watch some movie , relax your feet for a while and enjoy the story. I really enjoy this museum, easier to learning about history of this country. You will find the Car, flight, and war vehicle collection in outdoor museum. Its Amazing!! Bring your phone and start snap, many Intagramable object there!"
Interesting but not great,"We enjoyed a quick visit one night while in Seoul. It was interesting but not a must see. The plans, tanks and other military equipment display was fun."
The continuing thanks and gratitude from a nation,"A MUST visit when coming to Korea, never mind Seoul!!! A sobering reminder of the sacrifices given to form the building-base for an amazing nation .... who have never forgotten the soldiers who came in their hour of need. A brilliant park filled with military vehicles and aircraft to the right of the War Memorial is totally worth while!!!"
Very large area,"We stay in Itaewon.Just take the 421 bus line towards Seoul station.On the way there, the bus stop at this place.My nephew love it here.Outside area very big filled with planes, tanks, ship, boats and helicopters that some you can go inside it.A lot of time spent outside.Didn't have time to go inside the building.Will definitely go again."
It was an Ok place to visit. Not a must-see if you intend to go DMZ tour,"Went there in the afternoon. It was raining so I didn't take much great pictures. It was a good place to visit for information of the Korea War. But having visited the DMZ, I think this pales compared to what I have experienced.Still, it was good for people who didn't go to DMZ. I compared this to my cuchi tunnel experience in Vietnam. Everything comes more alive if you go to the actual area to experience it."
Super museum!,"The museum is very informative and explains the situations very well. A lot of artifacts, video support, statues etc.One of the best war museums that I have every seen.The museum is free and I think that museums about important happenings in history should always be free for people, because it is important that you learn/know these things. "
Excellent interactive museum,"We arrived in time to take the 2pm English free tour. Our tour guide was a retired gentleman who had been volunteering at the memorial for 10 years. He gave us a brief summary of the war, then had us watch a film explaining what happened in greater detail (approx. 18 minutes long). He then took us to a 4D experience with 3D glasses and a moved platform, which we were seated and fixed into, while we watched a 7 minute video from a first person perspective of what it was like to participate in the war. He explained a few more interactive exhibits, before deposited us in another 4D movie. This time I think the 4th dimension was “freezing during winter” as the air-conditioning seemed to be turned up to maximum in the room! The story was about one gentleman’s story as he experienced the war. A few more exhibits explained and the tour was done.The memorial could be viewed without the guided tour, but I think doing the tour really brought it all together. There are many interactive displays within the memorial and one could easily spend the entire day there. There is a free audioguide system in place which can be accessed from your own mobile phone (but I didn’t personally try it out so I can’t tell you if it works or if the quality is any good); the memorial has free wifi to facilitate access.The memorial has six halls, each with their own theme: Memorial, War History, Korean War and UN Participation, Donated Relics, Expeditionary Forces and ROK Armed Forces. There's a cafeteria on-site if you're in need of a snack during your visit. The memorial is within easy walking distance from the nearest metro station (Samgakji)."
Loved it - Interesting and Educational,"I was very surprised to find that this was my favorite part of South Korea. The museum is very well done, with videos to explain all the bits and pieces. I learned so much. We couldn't finish everything and came back a second day and enjoyed it just as much the first day! The only downside is that there was no restaurant except a mini-mart that had cup-o-noodles. I would plan meals away from the museum and break it up. Free entry and ships/planes/vessels from the war that you can explore outside!"
great among museums!,"i love it, i visited it many times, even if you are not history geek you will love exposition. so don't hesitate to go + it's for free"
Best Museum in Seoul,"Having visited most of the museums in Seoul, this one was the most interesting. Great feature on the Korean War."
Korean War memorial,"Arrived late in the afternoon so did not get to go inside however, the exhibits outside we excellent and kept us engaged for well over an hour. Many planes, tanks, and even a ship can be viewed."
Good for those who like to know more about the wars Korea fought,Provides a lot of good information about the wars Korea was associated with which led to the current situation. 
6 Star Staff,"Previously I posted a review stating my disappointed in the condition of our room , yes they need refurbishing and some renovations but the hotel itself is excellent .The staff are the best in the world and we have travelled extensively . We feel like family, if you are a friendly person they will embrace you with kindness, love and sense of fun .How they remember our names I have no idea but they all greet you with that huge infectious beautiful smile that makes you feel like you are at home .The housemaids cannot do enough to ensure you are happy, the barstaff are amazing and then there is the people in the restaurants ... nothing is an effort and they make you feel like royalty  The grounds are beautiful and perhaps the best beach in Fiji( we have stayed in 4 others ) great snorkeling !!Waterfall tour is worthwhile but check with the staff who has creditability as with other tours .Great place to unwind , no stress , everything provided ... we slept 10 hrs each night despite being at maximum capacity it still has a very relaxed vibe .Talk to the staff if you want to venture out.. we were lucky to be invited to their local Rugby final ...WOW what an unbelievable experience .. thank you Shelly at The Sunset Bar I'll be very sad to leave tomorrow not just because we return to sleeping 5 hrs and working 10 hr days but we will miss their faces and the kindness of the most beautiful people in Fiji Thank you ... btw I'll be back with my grandson .. this is kid's paradise "
Visit to learn about the Korean War.,South Korea is still technically still at war with the North.It is amazing the visit the Memorial to understand the South Korea side to the story. Very well displayed in chronologically - short films are very helpful. We spent 4 hour there.It is free to visit.
A must see history of the Korean War,"This is one of the most interesting Museum's I have ever seen. It is very well designed and informative.if you want to learn about the history of America's involvement in saving South Korea from certain defeatby North Korea this is an excellent, interesting exhibit. It has many well done exhibits, photos and stories of the impact on the civilian population. It also has a lot of information about America's unfortunate use of Agent Orange and the disturbing consequences on the civilian population. "
"Really nice docent-lead tour, learned a lot about Seoul.","Spent a few hours at the War Memorial and had a lovely docent-led tour of the museum by a wonderful gentleman. I wish I could spell his name, but he provided a terrific guided tour of the War Memorial Museum and I learned a lot about the Korean War which I was interested in as my Father has served in the War and was in Korea aboard a Navy vessel. Amazing how Seoul has rebuilt their city and in general how South Korea has become such a leading industrial nation after suffering from such horrible war times. Encourage everyone to go learn more!"
Lots of information about America's forgotten war,"It's a great museum with lots of military equipment, thousands of names on the wall to remind visitors of the sacrifices of many countries, not only South Korea. The problem is that most of the signage is in Korean. There is some English, but I'd like some more. The photos are the highlight."
"Interesting, informative and moving museum","The war memorial museum is a must visit in Seoul, particularly if you are interested in history. Focussed obviously on the Korean War but also has sections on early Korean history. The museum is huge and also has a large outside areas with many aircraft and ships. I spent about four hours here but could easily spend longer. Definitely recommend this memorial to visitors to Seoul. One other thing is that entrance to the museum is free!"
Even better than Louvre at Paris and the British Museum!!,"Go early in the morning once it is open, then you can enjoy the most and take the best photos everywhere, especially with those weapons outside, about which you can get very close to them. As an Asian I were particularly attracted to the background of the Korean War, rather touching over some display and stories mentioned there."
Superb! ,If you're into korean war history this place is not enough for a day. You should bring your snacks with you if you dont want to be interrupted by your lunch. There are plenty of vending machine just in case you need a drink.
Can enjoy for free,"The outside area provides plenty of replicas and statues related to the Korean War and the armed forces in general, that a visit just to the outdoor area is worth it. The large plaza with plaques commemorating the countries which joined in the Korean War is a very informative and sobering exhibit. "
Great learning experience,"I thought the memorial was about only the Korean War in the '50s, however, it is about all the wars Korea was envolver in. Very interesting to know the Korean history, specially how the country overcame all the difficulties and become a developed country. Amazing."
Tour,Must see place while in South Korea! Huge! And very well done. Be prepared to come back though. You can't cover it all in one day and you WILL want ti see more!
"Been here 3 times, would happily go another 3 more","Went with my school 3 times as an annual trip to Seoul for MUN. Thoroughly enjoyed every time I visited. So much history of South Korea documented in such a beautiful setting. I was lucky to be able to catch different exhibitions every time I went, which was extremely enriching and enjoyable. The permanent UN exhibit is definitely worth a visit, the museum has a great collection of UN-related artefacts. The outside exhibition of war vehicles was amazing. Even if you aren't interested in history that much, the museum has amazing exterior architecture with a lake, so it's perfect to just sit on a bench and relax for an hour."
Awesome museum ,I went here with a friend and we were expecting a stereotypical war memorial. But this one was so cool! The architecture was beautiful! There was so much to see and there was a lot immersive experiences that helped you understand what was going on. There was even a 4F experience and video art installations. It was beautifully done. There were tonnes of English translations or general English as well for people like me which made my personal experience more enjoyable. Also there were stories about previous wars not just the Korean War 1950. Highly highly recommend! 
spent day there,one of the nicest museums I've been in. very educational. the ships are great to look at and the Korean War section fascinating 
Great Place to Visit!,"Out of all the places that I visited, I enjoyed this location the most. Hands down, this is a great museum. The museum is laid out very well, story of the history of Korea is very easy to follow. "
Great experience,"Hands down this is one of the best museums around. The dioramas are spectacular, the 4D war experience was a great surprise and the monuments/boats/guns are neat to stroll through."
Museum and exhibition goes together.,You can have insight about Korean war from the museum and you can also enjoy great art exhibitions too. The theme and contents of exhibition changes always.
Very Interesting,My grandfather was in the Korean War. I found it fascinating to walk through this museum and see the progression of the war and to learn about the history of the continuing war between North Korea and South Korea. 
Excellent Museum,Spent 3 hours inside an out trying to see everything. It is a very good way to learn of the conflicts that Korea has good throug for over a thousand years. Starting with external kingdoms the Japanese and Chinese and finally the 20 th century to now. Very well done
Historic place,Historic place. An interesting visit for people who wants to know about the Korea´s War and see the machinery was used in. 
The War Memorial of Korea,"Poignant exhibits, war memorabilia, art works, and military equipment make this a perfect place to learn about Korea’s history of war, most notably with North Korea. Kids will enjoy the display of actual tanks and airplanes."
Informational ,Beautiful location and so much to soak in and learn. A must see if visiting Seoul. The staff was so nice and wanted to help! 
A must visit,"After a visit to the DMZ, the logical place to satisfy one's kindled interest and get an in-depth knowledge about the Korean war is in the War Memorial of Korea. Inside this imposing structure is a museum that puts you right into the Korean War. It is so configured that one is led into halls displaying how it started, who were involved, how it progressed, how it ended. A great tribute to all nations (whose flags fly proudly outside the entrance) that sent combatants and non-combatants alike to help a nation under siege. Spent about 2-2.5 hrs here. About a 3-minute walk from the subway exit. Admission is free."
Hands down best museum,"This is a museum like no other. Although specific to the Korean War (covers the Imperial period as well but clearly the focus is the 6/25 start of the Korean War by the invasion of North Koreans) this museum seamlessly combines historical artifacts abs pieces (declassified docs) with modern day technology to give an impressive background and history of the Korean War. Exhibit signs and clips are in multiple languages (english, Korean, Japanese, Chinese) Easily accessible by the subway line. Cannot believe that this exhibit is free. Both adults and kids will thoroughly enjoy this . If there's one museum that is a must see in korea , this is it. "
Awesome Memorial!,This memorial was great to visit and well executed. Everyone in our group from 80 to 11 came away impressed and enjoyed it. We spent nearly 3 hours and could have spent more time. 
War,A fantastic tribute to all nations involved in the Korean War. Great look at Korean history. Indoor and outdoor. Great location! 100 meters from line 4.
Very Well Done and Worth the Visit,We visited this as well as the National Museum of Korea and we liked this one much better. It has a great history of Korea as well as war in general on the 1st floor and then the bulk of the Korea War was on the 2nd floor. If you only have time for one museum I would visit this one. 
A Must see!,Excellent and well designed museum! Although it includes the most of history of Korea and wars they fought the largest exhibit is about Korean War. 
Just amazing,"This place is big and amazing, and it is free... You must visit this place, it is not only a War Memorial but more a History of Korea Museum. Easy to access with subway, you will need half a day to visit this massive area."
The museum is massive and well done,The museum at the memorial is 3 stories and I spent over two hours between it and the outside exhibit. Well worth the stop and it's totally free!
Must see in Southkorea,"A must see, when you are in Seoul and you are interested in Koreas history. Don't miss it. Big open air museum about the military carpark and planes in the park, also with a children museum.Additional info:- free entry- free book about south koreas war history- informations are in english- broschures in english- regular guided tours in english, korean every day (ask for chinese and japanese, probably it is available)"
Somber Reminder of Korean History,"A beautiful military history museum adjacent to the US military compound near Itewon, Seoul. The museum is free. Outside are many displays of military aircraft, ships, and armaments. Inside are various displays of Korean military history to include the Turtle Ship. The Korean War section is elaborate and in depth. Harry Truman made the right decision to defend South Korea. A legacy we are still living today."
Must see,"A huge museum, mainly dedicated to the experiences of the Korean War, with memorials to all the countries on the Allied side and the names of all those killed inscribed on the façade, which is vast. It was quite a shock to realise how many people were killed.Outside is boy toy heaven - lots of old planes, including a B52 bomber, tanks and a replica of the ship sunk by North Korea in 2010. Inside are some beautiful symbolic sculptures and more about the Korean armed forces than you would ever want to know. We visited on a Friday afternoon, where there was an hour long demonstration on how warfare had been carried out over the centuries, a military band and a display of marching and rifle twirling. All very entertaining. My guidebook says it happens at 2pm every Friday but not sure if this is the case. Even without the show it is well worth a visit."
The BEST and FREE Museum I have seen so far,"This War Memorial of Korea was the best museum I have been in Korea and possibly elsewhere. Not only does it describe the war, it is very big. Usually with this size of museum it probably would describe the entire history of Korea. But this museum describes the history only of the Korean War which is very interesting. ALSO FREE. WOW."
Amazing memorial,"Based on our experience with other memorials, we only allocated 1 hour when planning our day's itinerary. We ended up extending our time and could easily have spent 4 hours there. There is a large air conditioned museum and outdoor exhibits. Admission free. We learned a lot about the Korean war."
Sprawling tribute to fallen soldiers of all participating countries,"This museum remembers the not too distant past in which many nations participated to help South Korea be what it is today. Entry is free and one feels the gratitude the country has for the assistance it so badly needed, layered over the national and personal pain its citizens still feel, but bravely cope with."
One of Seoul's underated attactions,"I visited on a rainy day and was a great escape from the weather, saying this thou I would highly recommend this attraction even if it was sunny. great history from the discovery of Korea right through to present day of the history war that Korea has seen. Well laid out it is easy to wander through and skip anything you dont have time for. I felt everything was done tastefully and that Korea shows their appreciation for the UN and the countries that represented them in the Korean war. Very interesting I learnt alot and came out knowing a lot more than i did going in. For some reason not a big tourist attraction seemed to be more locals here, make sure you wander outside with all the planes before leaving."
Eye opening,"One of the best museums I have ever stepped foot in. This museum is huge! There is an outdoor exhibit and several exhibits inside. You must see fit yourself, it's a great history lesson, best of all, it's FREE! But please consider giving a donation, it is a very well put together Museum."
Big museum,"We spent about 3 hours here, but didn't get to see everything. It was enough though because we felt a little like death by museum by the time we left. We took a free English tour of the museum, but didn't feel as though it was helpful. Our guide just read out the headings of the main sections that we were entering and didn't really explain much. He pointed towards major items waving his hand vaguely, greeted other guests, and then took phone calls on his cell. We felt like it was a wasted hour.We walked around the museum alone after the tour for another two hours. I'd recommend to watch the videos places strategically at each entrance to a new area instead of going on the free tour. They give u an idea of what is to come and what you're looking at because the English translations of things are brief.They have a few interactive activities there which were fun for both adults and kids. There were also two movie theaters in there that only played during specific times. They looked interesting, but we didn't get to see them. We either missed it or didn't want to wait another hour for the next showing. Probably if we spent half a day here we could have seen everything."
Interesting experience,"I haven't seen many foreigners visiting the museum but I went there with my parents after checking out reviews here, and I wasn't disappointed. It's such a meaningful and interesting experience. My grandparents are holocaust survivors and therefore every war themed museum feels very close to heart. It's also good for people who want to learn more about Korea and not just travelled there because of the hallyu wave. Totally recommend!! "
Korean War memorial ,It was a great place to visit and I was humbled by all of those who sacrificed to make South Korea what it is today. An awesome place to visit. 
Interesting war memorial,Good chance to see some of the US armoury that was left behind - including a massive B52Lots of families use the grounds for picnics over the weekend - so not a sombre place as one might expect.
Greatest War Museum in the world...,"... least this is what they claim, Really huge, with most modern technologies for visitors equipped. Shows highlights of the last 1000 years of wars in Korea."
One of the best museums I have visited.,"As a person that has traveled extensively and visited lots of museum around the world, this has to be one of top notch museums. I am very interested in history and war, so this was a must visit. The exhibits were very well designed and thought out, there are written information to read, videos to watch, and lots of 3D and 4D exhibits to make you experience and understand the Korean War. I thoroughly enjoyed this museum and learned a lot in several hours. There is also an extensive outdoor museum with displays of previous tanks, aircraft, etc."
A great educational visit,"Neither of us knew too much about the Korean war, ok, nothing really, so a visit here was mandatory for us. We got a great introduction of the history of the war and where we are now. I highly recommend a visit here. It is very easy to access and also right across from the Dragon Hill Lodge. "
A must stop,We went on Friday which is the day they have various military groups in formal outfits which I found interesting. There are a lot of military planes and equipment. There is a Korean boat that had been shot at. There is a section inside where you can get something to drink. Bathrooms are clean. We were there for about an hour and felt we saw everything.
Great Experience.,"I booked one of the day tours from the city center of Seoul. The first part of the tour stopped at the war museum in Seoul. We were given one hour to look at the whole museum and I thought it was going to be really boring and depressing. The truth was it was really interesting and I could've spent at least three hours there. I learned a lot about the war and the tragedies that happened during it. It opened my eyes to such a terrible horrific war that can never happen again. Good experience, in all should take you about three hours to see everything."
Worth a visit,"We should have budgeted 2 hours here, as we didn't have enough time to see all we wanted to. Informative and impressive collection."
Wonderful Memorial,We visited this Memorial on a Saturday morning. It took us about 2 hours to go through it. It was so amazing and informative. 
Touching,"Everything is educational about the military history of Korea. It is touching even the monument outside. Expect informative exhibits if you are interested about Korea's past. Make sure that when you go to this place the weather is nice to see the western part of the museum where there are airplanes, missiles and other large-sized weapons. So, if you want to learn and make your vacation more educational, this place is a must to see."
"Beautiful, touching",Exemplary work. The memorial is a tribute to the Korean people and all the allied nations who contributed. The attached museum is very well done as well. This should be on your must-visit lost for Seoul.
Favorite Museum in Seoul,"This is easily one of my favorite museums in Seoul. Just to clarify -- This is NOT only a ""Korean War"" museum. It is about the history of warfare in Korea's past. That means you should absolutely wander to the lower floor to see a replica of the famous Turtle Boat and predecessor of the multiple rocket launcher (which, btw, was featured in a MythBusters episode). There are some really fascinating exhibits, including an old car used by Kim Il Sung and one of the most extensive military equipment displays I've seen. There GREAT things inside *and* outside so I recommend coming on a nice day as well so as to not miss out on the airplanes, missiles, and armored equipment just to the west of the museum."
Amazing,"Where do you start! The parade was the best I've ever seen, precise precision movement and colourful costumes of every branch of their armed forces old and new.Kids kept entertained by the many mascots and lots of photo ops to be had.Watch from the step area to get the best view as they come from all directions, get there early to grab a spot.Inside the memorial great, they really showcased the help Australia gave them, our national flag flying proudly alongside theirs."
Must visit,"The museum is huge and there is outdoor and indoor area. Indoor area show the weapon and history whereby outdoor area show plane, tanks and warship. You can easily spend 4-5hrs here. Inside the museum there is a few 3Dmovies. Additional points is the museum are free of charge. "
Korean and Vietnam War ,Good to visit and free . There are lots of planes and tanks outside - mainly American - used in the Korean War . Inside there is a lot of history and very well organised with films . You can see that North and South Korea have battled for a long time and because of the geographical position of Korea it is susceptible to invasion . There also always appears to have been. a Kim in charge of the North . Or some other dictator from Manchuria . It's also about the Korean War and the battle between north and south with the UN intervention . The war lasted between 1950 and 1953 . Korea felt obliged to help in Vietnam . And it seems that participation helped its friendship with the West especially USA . There is a stark warning about nukes and Kim . Good pretzels in the cafe 
A very comprehensive and interesting museum,"My husband, teenage daughter and I visited the War Memorial of Korea on our recent trip to Seoul. This is quite a massive museum, which covers the Korean War in great depth and also various other Korean conflicts through the ages. As foreigners, we found the Korean War exhibits of greatest interest. Extensive galleries are dedicated to this conflict, with hundreds of artifacts on display all with detailed English explanations. Each of the countries that participated in the war also has its own mini-exhibit with statistics on troops served, casualties, etc. In addition to more traditional object displays, the museum also incorporates some interactive, digital elements and shorts films, which bring the history further to life, particularly for teens and young people who tend to be more screen-oriented. There is also a large outside display of military aircraft, vehicles, etc., which is quite impressive. Personally, I would have liked to hear a little more about the civilian experience of the Korean War but the military history and geo-political aspects of the conflict are extremely well covered. Note that the museum is really extensive. We spent approximately 3 hours on our visit but military buffs could undoubtedly spend an entire day, as there are so many things to see and discover. The free admission also make this a very accessible visit. Highly recommended."
Spend worth time here!,"It was a great time to explore the history and more attitude. Before that I had watch Yi Sun Shin movie, the Admiral of Navy, he was a clever in the critical time and beat Japanese navy at that time. So, I did find him here. There were many groups of students visited here as sightseeing subject of school."
Impactful,"This museum is a must see, although you have to have an interest in history and war. It does not only cover the Korean war, which saw soldiers from all continents unite to defend South Korea but basically all conflicts in Korea, from the supression of the Manchu tribes to the Imjin war and Japanese occupation during WOII. Every part has an English introduction but most of the item descriptions are in Korean.The museum is free and also has a kids museum although I did not visit it. "
Excellent rememberance to the Korean war.,"What a great museum, and I did not even get to see the inside. Unfortunately I only had the Monday to visit the museum, but most museums are close on Mondays. But this museum has so many outside displays, information, remembrances, architecture and honouring other nations that I was still able to spent about 3 hours there. Great to see a nation honouring those who came to help them in a time of need and still maintaining it so well. I will definitely come back and totally recommend this museum."
For a memorial really really good,There is so much to see and to learn. All open air and for free. Located close to the subway station Sinyongsan street with some local restaurants around.
Nice & really worth to visit when you're in Seoul,"This is really a historical place to visit, the flags of all the countries contributed or rendered support were there standing. You will see many kinds of air force planes and we're lucky that during our visit there's an exhibition which was fantastic."
Very impressive,Very impressive war museum which practicly explaines where is South Korea today with the conflicts in the erea. It is all about wars in Korea in all times. Recomanded.
Interesting Place,Good place to spend a few hours if you like history or had kin killed in the war. There is a wall listing all who died in the conflict (US dead are listed by state). There are movies and dioramas and weapons. Don't forget to get your free book inch thick which chronicles the war day by day.
Worth the time,"Need to expend at least 3 hours for the visit to be worth. The exhibitions are great, particularly the one about the Korean War. The outside sculptures are quite impressive."
Amazing,"You can spend here a couple of hours, to learn all about the korean history and wars. Very well set up , with some amazing video's and artifects."
Heart warming,"I really enjoyed this location. They have ingraved every person that died fighting in the Korea war from each country on the walls. The outside displays a lot of machines (planes, tanks, etc) used in those wars. I didnt even make it inside but the outside was great. "
A good day out,"The memorial is like nothing I have seen before and gives you a good insight into the Korean war.You really do get a sense of how proud this country is about their accomplishments from the past and you will learn a lot! I loved this place so much that I made sure I visited on my second trip too.This place is massive. Allow plenty of time to walk around. I took a packed lunch and ate near the tanks and planes. I think this place is great for anyone - families, solo or travelling with friends."
very interesting to learn about the Korean War,Have to give credit to Seoul that this museum is free. It had English translation for probably most if not all displays. it had 3d and 4d short movies for free. Best museum in Seoul according to me.
Excellent museum,We have been to numerous museums in Seoul and this is a definite one to see when in town. The museum is free and history books were also being handed out on the day we attended. One of the main points is to thank the United Nations . This is beyond just the overall general history. Most displays and videos had Korean and English options. Got a good sense of what the people in. Korea have gone through over the centuries
One of the Better Museums in Seoul,"Seoul has a dearth of quality museums, but the War Museum is one of the only must-sees in your visit."
Tanks and planes,"Put this on your to-do list in Seoul.It is a museum with free admission.The statue at the front is inspiring, and it has a huge collection of old tanks and planes and also a ship you can go through (with added dramatic effects).The indoor experience was a bit barren and didn't seem to offer as much as the vehicular display, but I'd say it is worth a visit.In early March 2017 it was not busy at all.Easy to get to via bus #421.We stayed less than 2 hours."
"Fascinating history, great presentation - and free!","This place is huge, haunting and interesting - an amazing museum experience. You should allocate at least 3 hours, so come before 3pm, as it closes at 6pm.There are three ""Korean War Rooms"", and we spent an hour or so in each.Recommended for anyone visiting Seoul."
Must See,Glad that we went to the War Memorial Of Korea !! The entrance fee was free and there were so many old fighter planes exhibited. We took so many beautiful pictures and all of the planes were still so well maintained. Nice place to visit when in Korea ! Highly recommended ! 
Good museum to see what happened in this forgotten war,"This large museum tells the story of Korean war where Soviet Union, China and North Koreans fought with the UN troops. There photos and some text in English. Museum shows many guns, tanks and airplanes inside and outside of the museum. Outside wall has names of those who lost their lives in the war. There is also a section about Vietnam war, where many Koreans served their military service. There are usually some volunteer guides able to speak English to show around. Couple hours should be enough to walk this thru. Museum is located next to Samkagji subway station and next to Yongsan US Army base. From the museum there is easy walk to Itaewon restaurant area. "
Huge must see war museum! ,This museum is very large. My husband and I were unable to see it all due to my bad back and knees. (I cant be on my feet for more than a few hrs.) What we saw was amazing. They have lots of interesting pieces and exhibits. The memorial is a powerful experience. They have outside and indoor exhibits and they are all interesting. You could easily spend a whole day here. Plenty of bathrooms and a few places to grab some quick food (as well as vending machines.) Definitely a must see if you are in Seoul!
respect this monuments,i tooke a bus to get here from Myeongdong station exit 8 infront of Migliore. get off exactly when the sign the war memorial. worth to be here as we can see the tanks ships and fighter jets used in the korean war. close to the ministry of national defence. any bus to itaewon will stop here. the subway-need to update the name- close to the ministry.but 5 minutes walk
Huge!,"I, unfortunately, didn't get to explore all of this museum but what I did see was very interesting. I particularly enjoyed the interactive exhibitions in multiple languages."
Best museum we've been to,"This museum is amazing. The way the exhibits are put together is captivating. So many mixed uses of media that work effectively to tell the story of the history of Korea and the separation into the two Koreas. The grounds around the museum are also amazing. Tanks, planes, a boat and artillery spread out on land the size of multiple sports fields. You could spend half a day to a whole day here. We ended up going back on a second day to see the exhibits we missed. Highly recommend to all. "
Brilliant!,"Incredible place to visit,The exhibits within the museum.The sculptures outside.The layout of the buildings.An awesome experience. "
Glad we visited,"For those who would like to understand better the Korean War, it is best to visit this memorial.We took a free guided tour and went around with our guide for an hour. He explained important dates and highlights of what happened from 1950-1953. I personally found it an eye opening experience, seeing Korea beyond the beautiful palaces and the brightly lit shopping areas. To hear something like this actually happen is beyond imaginable and I hope it never happens again.Perhaps a very painful event in Korea but I understood why it has to be passed on and never forgotten. It carries lessons from the past and it is part of Korean heritage that the whole world should learn from.Apart from the stories, the museum has a lot of very interesting displays, some movies are in 4D, and larger than life aircrafts, tanks and ship have been preserved for people to see. During our visit they were also distributing a free book on the Korean War for those who would like to read more about it."
Worth the trip,"We didn't have much expectation for the War Memorial but were blown away once we got there. It's near the train station so it's very easy to find. There's a lot to see on the outside, we arrived around 6 so didn't have a chance to go inside. We like how the plaques are also in English so we know what the statues mean. "
War Memorial was very well done,I have visited here a few times. The museum is well cared for and has a lot of artifacts. It is definitely a must see while in Seoul.
Great museum for kids and adults alike,"This is an excellent military history museum with a very large outdoor park that displays tanks, airplanes, and even a ship! You can learn a lot of Korean history by just walking through the permanent exhibit. For those who are interested in the Korean War, it offers a comprehensive, visceral and sobering experience. They offer 3-D virtual reality theaters and other interactive experiences. You may have to line up for these but it moves quickly. The regular exhibit and the park are free. "
History of Korea,If you are interested in korean's history this is the perfect place. The exhibition is good inside and also outside. Sometimes there are thematic exhibitions ... I really enjoy to spend one morning there ! 
An excellent museum,"On a scale of 1-10(excellent), this is an 10+ museum. My only regret was I thought an hour would be enough to spend at this museum. Boy, was I wrong. I regretted going towards the end of the day. You can spend many hours here and be prepared to be overwhelmed by the excellent exhibits. Short on time, I thoroughly enjoyed the section ""the UN in the Korean War""."
Fantastic experiece,I've been to many museums having grown up overseas and in the Washington DC area. This was one of the most impressive. I'd go back on my next trip. It's that good.
"Good place but if you have huge empathy for others, be prepared to get sad","This place discusses the history of South Korea's fight for its land. But the huge statues (or whatever they're called) outside the museum itself were mostly about the fight between the North and South. Inside, the museum is divided into three floors (if I remember correctly). It has arrows so one does not get lost. There are vending machine for drinks scattered about the place, as well as water fountains and restrooms. There's a cafe inside as well in one of its floors.Like I said in the title, if you're big on empathy, the areas discussing atrocities of war will get to you.It's a sad place that speaks of truth. ""Freedom is not free."""
good for non Koreans,Very interesting and plenty of captions in English. The DVDS and the section on UN forces contribution especially good. Highly recommended.
The best museum I've ever visited.,I was blown away by how good this was. You could easily spend hours and hours here. Couldn't fault a thing. An incredible insight into the history. 
Solo day out,"I passed by the War Memorial of Korea after visiting the National Museum of Korea. Its very close to it. and its easy to visit both in one go. If you love museums and history, this is a def worth visiting. "
Exactly what a museum should be,"This is our second visit to this excellent site. Like the Australian War Memorial, this is not a celebration of war, but rather a reminder of the costs of war spanning the history of Korea. The displays are interactive and interesting and well sign posted in English. We spent an easy 3 hours here and our 5 year old was captivated. The outside display of Korean War equipment was a highlight and incredibly informative. Highly recommended! There's a small children's museum at the end of the display and you need to reserve a time at the counter. Unfortunately no activities are in English, but you can easily interpret what it is. At the end there is a play area which was quite welcome on the rainy day we visited the museum. "
A sober visit,"This war memorial is a tribute to all who lost their lives in a crucial part of preserving Korea! The grounds are kept up well, the monuments and information were very engaging and kept the visitors moving! I highly recommend for the history or military buff!"
World Class ,I'd reckon I've likely been to more than a hundred museums in forty something countries. This was the best. Seoul is only second to London worldwide in quality of museums for me. Vital information to understand Korea and what the people have been through.
Great for war buffs history buffs and young boys,"This is my 7 year old boy's favorite museum in Korea. He loves to climb up the stairs and look inside the exhibits like planes, tanks and others. You can easily spend an hour outside just playing on the big stuff and snapping some photos. Inside has more serious exhibits and info on the UN forces and losses during the war. Also admission is free. Worth visiting at least once."
Can spend the whole day there...,"If you have interest in war history, you can spend the entire day there. However, a majority of the descriptions are in korean. It is recommended to join a guided tour in English which the memorial provides at certain times and for free, i guess. I saw ticketing booth at the entrance but the booth was closed and nobody was selling nor collecting tickets on my visit. There are 3 floors and the 3rd floor is dedicated to the Korean War. From this visit, i now understand how the war started and how the world stepped in to help via the UN, it was not just the American but they did send the largest troop. Didnt know countries like Ethiopia, South Africa, Columbia, Philippines, Thailand...etc had their troops too in action too.Now I also understand the present conflict between North & South, PRC & US, US & Russia, this conflict went all the way back to how the Korean war started. How Kim Jung Il seek agreement from Stalin & support from Mao Ze Dong to attack the South. How quickly the North overran the South, how ill prepared the South was for this war with almost no credible military assets while the North had been training under the Russians, how the UN stepped in, how they fought back and almost defeated the North, when the troops from PRC join the fight, when they called for cease fire....etc. Interesting to know that there was no winner nor loser in this war, it was only an agreement to ceasefire and a line was drawn to separate the North & South. Good education for the younger generation. It is really touching to learn how many countries step in to help, many of them are still rebuilding after WW 2 which ended about 4yrs prior. It is touching to know many thousands of young soldiers died ""...defending a country they have never seen and people they never knew"" (saw this quote in this exhibit as a tribute to the UN soldiers). "
Possibly the best museum I've ever visited ,"I spent over three hours at the museum and thoroughly enjoyed it. There are so many exhibits and I learnt a lot about Korean history, not just the war.There is a lot in English which helped the enjoyment. You could EASILY spend 5 to 6 hours in the museum if you watched all the great videos and read all the information.This is a must see in my opinion "
Please do go and see this,"It's got a lot of stuff here to see. Most memorably the aircraft, tanks and missiles in the outside exhibit. Of particular interest is the B52, the Mustang fighter and the MiG19 flown from North Korea by a defector. Inside you will find a series of rooms with information and artefacts mainly about the Korean War, but also other periods. Perhaps a little light on details ... But what I liked was the very profound way that the museum was very much a living memorial to those who had died in the war. All done with dignity and respect. Well done"
Must see place in South korea,It is a must see place in South Korea. Full Korean war history is displayed in the museum. Need almost a day if you want to cover every thing in detailed.
war Memorial,"Excellent attraction with first class exhibits inside and out and full description in multiple languages. We visited this venue with our grandson who is studying the Korean War at school.Highly recommended attraction, a definite 'Must See'."
Must see to understand Korean history,"We didn't have enough time to go to the entire War museum and will go back in the future by planning more time to see it all. We only went into the Korean War area. Very helpful in understanding the war and the peace and reunification that South Korea desires. Great displays inside and outside. Outside displays include a ship that you can go on. Also includes, planes, tanks, etc. Large memorial was very moving."
Good and vivid retelling,"Very nice museum with a lot of detailed and interactive information ! Don't wait for the 4D theatre, but if you're there on time try it. It's fun."
Touching place,"I`ve visited this place several times, each time it`s a great feeling, there are many showrooms and different items regarding the korean war. I`ve seen also represented all countries witch took part to the conflict. Outside there are all the weapons of the korean war (tanks, aircrafts, choppers etc.)I suggest yout!"
Nice museum and it's free!,"I loved the outdoor exhibits and the various exhibits indoors too. However, more labelling or explanation would have been helpful in some of the indoor exhibits"
Informative Museum,This is the place to go to learn about the Korean war history and also the current relations with North Korea. It's a very moving museum with a lot of emphasis placed on peace and reuniting with Nkorea. Definitely give yourself 2-3 hours for a decent visit.
Beautiful memorial,"Well worth a visit, ensure you visit the war museum which is located nearby the war memorial to learn more regarding the history."
"Interesting, educational visit about Korean War",I went there with my parents when we visited Seoul. My dad & I were quite blown away with the details of the permanent exhibition. The vehicles and machinery on display were really interesting. It also taught us a lot about what happened in Korea war and the role of UN in helping South Korea at that time. The personal belongings of those who fought in the war on display were very moving. Freedom is not free indeed.
The most in-depth museum of the Korean War,"The War Memorial is both a memorial and an excellent museum. From the perspective of a Korean-American, its explanation of the history leading up to the war and the phases of the war was excellent and in-depth. Although there is a definite perspective (from ROK viewpoint), the presentations were much more objective than I expected. If you are visiting Seoul, I would consider this to be one of the 3 ""must-see"" museums or palaces."
History shared in an engaging and entertaining way,"What a fantastic museum, interactive exhibitions, including a 4D cinema experience where you can get a sense for how the war would have been. A good mix of facts and personal stories/accounts to learn and keep your interest. Great for history buffs who want in depth information, but equally for families - parents can learn about Korea, while the kids are kept occupied with fun exhibitions, I believe that there is a kids museum section too. Plus it's free!! U"
Great Visit,The statues tell a very detail and sad story. It especially shows the bond between the US and South Koreans
An Interesting Historical Site,"We enjoyed our trip to the War Memorial of Korea. There's a lot to see. The outdoor exhibit is interesting, featuring aircraft, tanks and other defensive equipment. "
Huge but you have to be interested,Huge cavernous building for the exhibitions plus lots of hardware and sculptures/monuments outside. If you were really interested in the detail of war in Korea over the years it'd take a few hours to absorb everything.
Really great museum,"I learned a lot about the Korean war, info I just didn't know! Highly recommend taking the free guided tour in English!"
So much to see and understand!,"If you love the history and art of war here is where you need to come! Over 5,000 years of history in this awe inspiring place. Also if you love tanks and planes there are no shortages here! Step right upto a US B-52 bomber and explore aa Patton tank plys so many others!"
Excellent museum,"This is an excellent museum, covering South Korea's military engagements since 1945. They have an extensive collection of tanks and aeroplanes and well set out displays on the Korean War, Vietnam War and South Korea's involvement in UN operations. My husband and teenage boys all loved this museum. We spent most of the day here."
"The pride of a free nation celebrating the fight for freedom, through the military ","As the sign says FREEDOM IS NOT FREE This museum and showpiece explains the fight and Struggle. South Korea had over the last 60 odd years to be free and to build a vibrant modern industrial country where the living standards have benefited all the people.It has stories of heroism and the coming together of the nations to support Korea in the their struggle, a terrific museum with the latest Visual aids to show the story in real terms. "
Amazing and impressive museum.,"O.convenient tranceportation by subway train. 0.no entrance fee and can get useful pamplets and memorial book. 0. Great sight room on the second room - Korean War 1, 2 0.Many real used troops include Tanks and bomb airplanes. 0. Enough parking lots and cheap fee. 0. Affordable for all ages."
Sad but true ... Must see to understand!,"Great and interactive experience that all history lovers have to add to their itinerary while visiting Seoul. I was actually crying at the end but isn't this the purpose to remind us what we must not allow to happen again? Museum for adult and child, regardless of if you are into understanding or not the nature of the war itself. "
Seoul War Memorial,"This is an impressive and modern museum covering Korean history from ancient days to modern times. The centerpiece of the museum is a replica of Admiral Yi Sun Shin's turtle ship. A great deal of the museum is devoted to the Korean War period. Lots of outdoor static display pieces of aircraft, tanks and boats. A must see!"
Amazing!,Very good place for everybody whi wants to know a lot of about Korean War.Even it is closed on Monday still it is worth to come to see outsite exhibition.free
Awesome,"If you like war history this is a must see. personally, I am not in to it, but I spent 2-3 hrs exploring here without any great interest in the topic! There are loads of screens/ information documents etc to satisfy history buffs. Outside the museum are aircraft, tanks and missiles form various battles. Inside the huge exhibition halls are fantastic dioramas complimented by digital imagery to provide an experience. there are several 4D theatre experiences around the museum- unfortunately all run at exactly the same time so you can't do more than one at a time...it'd better if they scheduled these at staggered times.It was a really well done museum- some information in English, not all. "
Must go,"If you are planning on going to the border (DMZ, JSA etc) you should come here first. Also if you just want to brush up on your Korean history knowledgeThe entire museum is great, but especially the sections on the Korean War offer an easy, inspiring and educational overview of the war. There is no entrance fee!"
Great memorial,Amazing statues and museum. When I went there was a militar presentation which was so cool! Worth it!
One of the best military attractions,"Within easy walking distance from the Dragon Hill Lodge, this is a must see. Historic, well designed and maintained, it's a wonderful educational experience."
Worth a visit inside and outside ,"Great museum inside and out. As soon as I walked in I was offered a tour in English from one of the curators, which was excellent and focused on 1950-53. "
Touching Tribute ,"This is my first visit to a war museum and i am glad we included it in our itinerary. We went there at 4 pm and i was a little sad we missed the scheduled 2pm tour (the other time being 10am). But we were very happy that they arranged a special tour for us!! We appreciated the place more because of the tour guide. If you want to visit the place, pls attend the tour. It will be more meaningful that way. "
Impressive!,"There is much more here than just the statue. Impressive area with the monument, several sculptures, a USA plane, etc."
A moving memorial,"The Korean War separated numerous families, Korea is still recovering from this war and hoping for reunification. I didn't go in the museum, but did enjoy the memorial area with the sculptures as well as military equipment."
"If you only visit one palace, make it this one","Lovely palace, not especially expensive (more so if you're in traditional costume - free entry). Historical information provided all around the palace and grounds"
"Amazing, Perfect Museum on the Korean War","I was in South Korea in Seoul for the weekend i went to visit The War Memorial of Korea.The museum tells very well the history of the war of the South Korean and he is gigantic and extremely well documented.Many gifts are allowed to collect, authentic objects from different events.I made a private excursion in the DMZ: road invasions in North Korea, It was very short, I think it's too bad, I do not had them time to visit everything.I learned a lot about the history of their war, I loved how the museum was presented. I saw so much monuments, statues very pretty and War Machine it was amazing.. i saw so many cars and planes very cool, i found that awesome ! This is something you should not miss if you go to South Korea I would recommend it to anyone. I love South Korea ! Entrance is free for all ! :)"
Greay,This is a wonderful and very informative memorial I highly recommend it. Not to expensive located in town 
nice place and view,"After few days in Seoul and this place is final our my trip in Korea, though the weather is nice during I am here. Next time will stay longer to enjoy Korean food and wine.(Jinro)"
Impressive and interesting,"That the memories of the Korean War have not yet faded is clear by this monument and museum of almost North Korean dimensions. There is a large exhibition with numerous film clips about the recent war, but also about the wars ion the hundreds of years of previous history. Also the present state of the army is exhibited. The monuments show the gratitude of the South Korean people for the many countries of the UN that came to their aid without often even having an idea of whom they were helping. There was just this notion of injustice being inflicted on innocent people. Actually an example for the present day."
emotional visit,"since my grandfather participated in this war, it was an emotional moment for me. the overall ambiance is getting people to feel the history and the soul of the war. it's certainly worth to visit during your trip to Seoul."
Great reminder of the battles fought,The grounds are full of artifacts and open to the public. Great for an afternoon stroll even if you don't want to enter the museum.
A must see in Seoul. its free.,Amazing place near to a subway station. Free entrance. The place is really nice if you are interested in the korean war or if your country support south korea as Colombia did for example. You will be proud to see your flag but sad for the people who died there.
Great museum ,The museum is great especially the outside exhibition with all the ships aircraft tank and other military vehicles The inside is also well organised and with your smartphone you can enjoy explanations There are very interesting rooms. If you like history you definitely have to go there 
Must visit place,"It's must visit place if you are in Seoul, lot of things to see regarding war history of Korea. And best part is that it's free "
Korean War memorial,By visiting korean war memorial you can know the past of the koreans which is located just in front of American military base camp. 
Decent history lesson,I think it is more than just a War Memorial bec the various rooms do give a decent history of historical Korea
Great museum,"Worth spending an afternoon there. It is huge, so be prepared to walk. It's great for you to learn a bit about the Korean History. "
Educational,"Like most museums in Seoul, it's close to the subway and very reasonably priced. Lots of airplanes outside (accessible for free) including a B-52 (which was not used in the Korean War) if you're into that."
Very interesting,"This memorial has special meaning to US tourists I think, US lost lots of soldiers helping out here. Very well done, explained history well"
Very Worth my While!,"If you're a sucker for history like me and fascinated by weapons or warfare; then this place is Candy Land! everything was well organized, maintained, kept and complete. I could spend a whole day in this place and it will take a whole day off your itenerary if you want to see everything. it is just HUGE. and the bonus? It's absolutely FREE"
"Fascinating history, both military, political, and cultural","We went expecting to see some basic memorials, and was blown away by the breadth of this museum. The best no-admission-cost museum we have ever been in, and one of the best overall. Great for anyone looking to learn more about Korea. "
A must see. ,"If you are a history buff, this memorial traces Korea's military past, all the way through modern times. It is a huge facility so make plenty of time and bring comfortable shoes. "
Huge memorial/museum - very impressive,"This place is absolutely massive - both inside and out. Outside the huge forecourt with various statues is very impressive along with all the aircraft, boats, vehicles and artillery/missile pieces! There's even a USAF B52 there!Inside is absolutely huge, with impressive displays covering every single conflict Korea has been involved in over thousands of years."
Lovely Memorial,Great to walk around. Very respectful to the ones that lost their lives in battles. This Memorial is free and open to the public. 
One of the best war memorials I've been to.,"Well worth a visit if you have a couple of days in Seoul. The externals of the memorial are impressive with static displays, and tributes to all countries that played a part in the Korean war. The artifacts and internal displays are also very good. The overwhelming message of the memorial is one hopeful of peaceful re-unification with the North, which is a feeling you get speaking to most South Koreans."
Impressive outdoor display,"For those who want to see with your own eyes the history between North and South, the Korean War, this memorial is part of the war museum and it is very close to Itaewon. Easy access by public transport. Some prior reading of the Korean war would be helpful. "
Help me to understand Korean history and the Korean War,"We spent a whole day here. There is a coffee shop we can buy lunch. A very worthwhile visit. If you have time, join a DMZ tour to see the situation today."
A place to remember,"Take a visit to reminisce what happened during the times that South Korea went to war. In case you would like to shop some items, they have an available souvenir shop nearby."
Astounded,"Few of my favorite places in every destination are Parks. When my friend invited me to go to this place, i have no second thought to agree... well, being new to the place, I was curious about what the country was experience during the WWII. Well, I was so very proud to know that Philippines is part of the Korean War."
very thorough museum,"museum offers a thorough, engaging review of the many wars which have befallen Korea. We were particularly lucky and pleased that a young university student wanted to practice her English and gave us a guided tour through key parts of the exhibit (this seems to be an offer from the museum management so ask for this when you come in -- it seems they're offered in several languages). The exhibits are exceptionally well done and detailed, giving great context to So Korea's war history. "
Grand building with free admission!,"The public buildings in Seoul are on a grand scale. All the museums we have visited are impressive but because of the purpose of this building perhaps the grandest of them. We just missed the guided tour so decided to do it on our own. Which didn't strike us as a handicap.I agree with the review by 40girl, and therefore also highly recommended. The Korean War onwards I thought would be most interesting, but the history of Korea is extraordinary and extremely well presented using different media. Also provided with a free book on the Korean War in English, but numbers might be limited as there were many when we entered in the morning but got the last one when we left (2 hours later).Highly Recommended."
Interesting and sad place ,"We took the English guided tour to begin with. Our guide was very young & skipped over parts that he thought wouldn't be interesting for us (or him) which was fine with us. He told us some interesting stories & then left us to wander around at our own pace. It's a huge place & we loved wandering around taking in what interested us. The displays were really well done both inside & out & we are really glad we visited. Was really valuable especially as we visited the DMZ a couple of days later. Allow a good few hours to really see everything, we stopped for a coffee in the cafe halfway through. A highlight of our week in Seoul. "
Afternoon well spent,"Made you understand Freedom is not Free. Well laid out, very informative, very enjoyable. Outside displays of airplanes, tanks, missiles and different calibre guns was something special."
Must visit for anyone interested in history,"The War Memorial of Korea is a fantastic site in Seoul and probably one of the best military museums in the world. There are basically 2 distinct areas to the monument - inside and outside. The outside consists of many different pieces of military equipment used by both sides during the Korean War (Tanks, planes, artillery and a boat). This is all really cool and in great condition. You can really interact with some of these vehicles (e.g. Sit in the drivers seat of and armored personnel carrier, walk around the boat, etc.). There's also several statues to commemorate the war and monuments explaining the involvement and contribution of the various nations who fought with the UN against the North Koreans.The inside is an excellent museum which covers the Korean War as well as various conflicts beginning as far back as the ancient Korean kingdoms through the Japanese colonial period. Lots of cool artifacts, models and multimedia here. There's no entrance fee, which was also nice.Overall, it's a great attraction which gives a comprehensive background on the military/political history of Korea through the end of the Korean War."
Excellent museum ,Well layed out. Interesting. Lots of audio visual exhibits. Outdoor section great for kids to see real planes and tanks. 
Visited to get an overview of Korean war,In short ~ outstanding ~ highly recommend. Covers war Plus history and has best selection of planes from war and all the rest including memorial to brave souls whom scarified their lives so Korea is peaceful today
War Memorial of Korea,Awesome museum. Very nice collection of artifacts from many centuries of war and conflict in the region. 
The exhibits on the Korean War were the best,"Enjoyed our visit here. If you have limited time, skip the lower level exhibits on earlier Korean military conflicts, they are a little dry. The experience in the Korean war section was much better."
Loved it & FREE admission!,"Totally cool place to take your sons on a history tour of tanks, aircrafts, war ships! They have the famous Korean turtle ships! More of a father & son place to visit, while the ladies go off to get our hair done or go shopping. This place is free, so why not!"
Absolutely worth a visit,"The exhibit and grounds are extensive. While I thought the displays would concentrate on the Korean War, I walked away with a much better understanding of the length of Korea's history and culture and how resilient the Korean's are, having resisted countless attempts to occupy the strategic peninsula. Could spend hours here."
A Museum where the History of South Korea Comes to Life,"If you want to learn about the South Korea history and wars, this War Museum and Memorial is superb and impressive. The artifacts are detailed and comprehensive. The infrastructure and design of the museum are fantastic. My son and I spent the whole day awed by the exacting details of the museum. The clever use of the multi-media provided a very humanistic experience to the museum. I was most impressed to know that the whole of third floor was dedicated to the UN and allied forces who fought in Korea Wars. I would strongly recommend this war museum - a Must Visit place if you want to know about South Korea History."
Eductional,"The Memorial is in front of the Korean War Museum and a static display of vehicles, planes, tanks and even a boat. The museum provides in-depth information and displays about the Korea War. A must see for anyone visiting Seoul. "
a solemn experience,"I didn't realize that the museum has displays for the entire history of the Korean Peninsula. I spent 4 or so hours wandering the halls. It's a solemn experience. But it's also a must see to anyone visiting Seoul. The exterior displays are military hardware from the last 75 years. Planes, boats, tanks. Most are available for touch. I'm happy I had a chance to visit. I recommend to anyone interested in korean history. "
Amazing museum,Very nice museum.New and clean Beautiful marble. Lotst of resting places with coffee or snack.I loved it.
One of the BEST museum in Seoul,"The Admission: FREE AdmissionThe Museum: Korea's only museum that exhibits the entire history of the Korean war, housing 9,000 items of information and material related to the war. Very informative and educational. Definitely my favorite museum in Seoul. There is a 3D theater right next to where they display all the war flights, tanks, etc. It is on a small ship. It is free of charge as well. The Location: Subway Line 4 or 6, Samgakji Station, Exit 1 or 12."
"Planes, Tanks and more","If you are a history buff, or you are just interested in planes, tanks and other military equipment, this is the place for you. They have an outdoor area featuring real planes and tanks and even a ship. Inside the museum there are lots of interesting things to look at and free tours. "
Good museum ,"Well worth a visit , is military based but also reflective.Aircraft from the 50s/ 60s , if you want to see a B52 they have one!Inside calm & quiet and tasteful , good cafe .As always in Korea spotless & polite."
Atlas exposure,"Spend half a day, free, full of details, to learn a lesson of Korean history. Images and videos depicting the develop of the modern state of Korea, all the wars that surround it and the objects that mimic the environment that finally turn into this modern state. They show the power, in a poetic way, that the war with N. Korea didn't let the unification of the ideals of globalization and modernism that defines S. Korea."
"Free Guided English tour resulted in moving, memorable experience","Initially we were planning on doing this museum on our own without a guide but our hotel concierge alerted us to availability of occasional scheduled free English language guided tours so we timed our visit to coincide with this afternoon tour.. But first we visited on our own the somewhat nearby Contemporary History Museum which was a valuable preface to the memorial tour, which ably illustrated how far free Korea has come, from colonial oppression to an underdeveloped impoverished and corrupt third world country to now a leading industrial democratic nation and which is why winning the Korean War was so important in world history. The guided tour, with many interactive exhibits, was led, and I was told they are usually led, by retired Korean war army officers, adding to the sense of a living historical experience."
quite interesting to see the old war vessels and such.,"nice Sunday thing to do. It's free so why not? Though I feel like some parts of the exhibition kind of glorifies war to an extent, it is still a nice visit. "
Beautiful park,History and relics. A very nice tribute to the vets and fallen during the Korean War. A moivng and inspiring tribute.
The War memorial of KOREA,"Visited earlier this by bunking off from a Medical Exhibition.... did not regret it, I added another "" Buff "" to my collection..... I did not have the time to do a full Tour.... I left the meter running on the Taxi... because I did not know where I was.... will revist. According to Chris the inside is very much worthwhile.."
Must visit,This should be a priority on your itinerary during your visit in Seoul. We spent over 3 hours and we learned a great deal about the history of Korea. The information throughout is explained very well and illustrated clealry through diagrams and interactive resources. 
Amazing experience,"It's more of a museum than memorial. We missed the English tour, so they apologized and sent over another english speaking tour guide, a kid from stanford doing his military service. Learned so much from his enthusiastic tour. Definitely would recommend. "
Very informative,"Lots of walking very informative super static displays. Tanks, cars, planes, wepons, and boats. Many films large place and surprisingly it's free. A must see."
Amazing place and free to visit ! ,"So much to see in a day ! We visited this amazing place with family and learned so much about the country at the same time. There are a number of planes, tanks, helicopters and a small frigate along with missiles all outside the museum all with good description in English.Once inside the main building a whole history of Korea opens up and by the time you leave you have an insight into this wonderful country. An in depth understanding of the Korean War is a focal point and the memorials outside to all the country's who went to Koreas aid is interesting in its own merit.I found the work done after the war quite interesting and shows how the country changed over the years and why Korea is as advanced as it is now.I would certainly recommend a whole day at this attraction there is so much to see  "
"Free, reserve a time for the children's museum","This is a nice indoor and outdoor museum. I enjoyed the aircraft static displays. If you want to see the Children's museum, they had a reservation system on the Saturday we went to control the number of children admitted at a time. We only had to wait 20 minutes for the next window of time to open. It took less than an hour to complete the children's portion. We only went through two indoor exhibits and it is a very well done memorial. Highly recommend visiting while in Seoul."
Free for service members,"An amazing museum with too much to see in one day, but not to worry if you are military because addition is free for you and dependents, so split it up for different weekends."
Deeper Appreciation,A must visit. My grandpa was in the Korean War so it I really wanted to get pictures to send home to him. I'll never regret this and I have a deeper appreciation for Korean War vets.
Awesome summary of Korea,"Although the name suggests a focus on war, the whole exhibition is closer to a step by step of Korean history on the peninsula. Roughly three hours to do the walk through, and then a pleasant stroll around the tanks and aircrafts and ship replicas(commemoration of recent naval incident with North Korea). Tragic pieces of history, but quite romantic at the same time. Remember to be respectful on the compound."
Much more interesting than expected,"My wife, 12 year old son and I really enjoyed this museum. It covers a lot more than the Korean War and the building is quite impressive. "
"Large museum in Seoul city center, free entry.","Interesting museum to visit. Depends on what interests you have, I was mainly interested in military aviation. The museum is in three floors and on each floor there are several exhibition rooms. Many exhibits are explained in English language and there are film presentations on some topics, but these I missed, they all started on the hour. Provides insight to the Korean War and plenty of US material. Outside there is a display of various military aircraft used in Korea. The largest is the B-52 bomber, then there is the Phantom, MIG-19, AN2, small Cessnas etc. You can climb steps to see into the aircraft cockpit on most aircraft on display, including the B-52. I suggest you reserve 1,5 to 2 hours to go through everything at a reasonably quick pace."
A place where you will be transported to the past ,"As this review's title suggests, that's exactly how I felt. A wonderful guide, a uncle who is 72 years old, guided me throughout the museum. It was only suppose to be an hour, but he extended it to about 2 hours. It was great for me as I love history. And I'm very thankful for Mr Sohn Jong Hee's guide when I visited. Pre-history on Korea, Korean War, countries that dispatched resources to South Korea during the War etc. All these helped me understand Korea as a whole better. "
Must to visit,"Its most important historical place, you must visit there, free to enter. There are 4 floors. Really big museum"
A poignant and tasteful memorial,"My mother in law list her first husband to this war so this visit ad personal connections. Very tastefully and simply done. We were able to find the name we were looking for immediately. The recognition of foreign soldiers respectful.. Very moving. Further along is a giant display of military equipment, rather scary and hard to understand. A few minutes walk from the metro. Husband and I were moved and felt like we have visited the grave of a lost family member."
Not only War memorial but also concise abstract of Korean history,"Car parking was convenient and walking aroung the memorial was pleasant because the memorial was spacious still well organized. Outside of memorial building you can find the battle ships, air planes, tanks, and missiles. Also you can find the list of names from all of the world who sacrificed their lives for the peace and freedom of Korea. You'd better to wear comfortable shoes because you have to walk a lot to fully explore the memorial. In side of building, you can learn Korean history and watch the 4 D movie. This is place for all people but good for the family with young Kids."
Well worth the visit!,"This is not just about the ""last"" Korean War. It's about all of them.The museum reflects all Korea involved wars. Exterior to the museum are the armaments of war..airplanes, boats, ground transport etc.The square at the front of the museum has individual monuments and flags for all countries that participated in the last Korean War including individual regiments, number of participants and losses.The museum itself is very educational, beautifully laid out and well displayed.Though there is no entry fee, there are areas where donations can be made."
Important history!,"Visiting the war memorial of Korea is a great oppotunity to learn all about the history of Korea, the well known war and it's results on the present. Very interesting and informative."
Very interesting day ! ,I've been here with my girlfriend Minjung and she told me how is important for the Korean this place.
A must see in Seoul,I have visited the War Memorial of Korea on many occasions and always been impressed with the displays here. As a New Zealander i love the way South Korea acknowledges and appreciates the help many other countries gave during the war. A tribute that is worth visiting. A very moving experience.
Good place to visit for learning about Korean war,Good place to visit as an sightseeing. Many information for the Korean war and related real weapons and stories....
Awesome look into the history and culture of Korea,"I visited the War Memorial on a number of occasions and came away moved and impressed every time. I took students there on field trips three different times and visited with friends several other times, and I can assure you there is something for everyone. This should definitely be on your list of things to see in Seoul. Give yourself plenty of time because you'll want to be able to absorb the information and the emotional impact. A definite must see."
Tribune to the Heroic Soldiers that Defended Our Way of Life,"The War Memorial of Korea pays tribute to all the soldiers of all the nations that united in conflicts across the globe.Very hands on where you can look in the window of a real B52 Bomber, walk the decks of an ill fated Navy Frigate or feel and touch the artillery and weapons of past conflicts.Easy for kids and well catered for families. Food, drink and rest facilities.Time in right and you can see some amazing performances, depending on the holiday."
"A ""Must-See"" experience","The museum was one of the highlights of our trip. It was a bonus that there were no entrance fees. Be prepared to spend at least a few hours here as it is massive! The majority of the museum is indoors but there is also an outstanding outdoor section where you can explore the various military aircrafts/ships/tanks (and can go inside most of them too!) The majority of displays, including the videos, have English translations. There is so much history within the building and really worth visiting. The videos are also a must to watch! One tip: I wouldn't recommend the 4D video experience if you get nauseous easily as is quite full-on with lots of flashing lights and spinning experiences on the screen."
Very Interesting Museum...if a bit one sided,"Overall, the museum does a great job of explaining the history of the war. The exhibits are well labeled and detailed. I also appreciated the section dedicated to UN forces who fought to save the South from a Communist takeover. "
Get a good night rest and be prepared to spend 6-8 hours here.,This place requires a whole day commitment to get everything out of it. It's a massive 3 story museum and each floor is sprawling taking you through the entirety of the Korean War up to and beyond the ceasefire. Just the fact that this museum talks about one topic really gives you a really good understanding of what happened.
Fascinating insights,"I did nt know much about the Korean War. This museum both enlightened me about it - but also explained some of the way Korea had been created before then (battles with Japan, China and Mongol). It has made me look at Seoul differently since going there."
Beautiful museum.,We really enjoyed visiting this museum. They have many wonderful displays and it was very easy to walk through to see everything.
Very educational and inspiring,One of the best things to do in Seoul and cost nothing. Very educational and enlightening on the Korean Conflict.
"War Museum in Seoul, Korea","I visited the War Museum, in Seoul, Korea, and I would highly recommend any tourist that is traveling to South Korea this spring, to include the War Museum, in Seoul, as one of your highlight sites to visit. I went in the month of May, and it was absolutely beautiful! With their weather warming up in the month of May, and all the beautiful flowers in bloom, it was spectacular! You are able to walk around the outside gardens and water ponds, and tour the old war planes, and the battleship, and the submarine, in the out doors, and then go into the inside of the war museum, and learn alot about the history behind the Korean War. Take time to visit the simulator,and feel first hand, what it may have felt like to have been there. The temperatures in South Korea can be very cold during the winter months, and very hot during the summer months. However if you take a trip there during the springtime, or during the autumn months, you can really take advantage of the beautiful outdoor sites and wonderful weather, while enjoying the culture, and learning about the history, of one of the most beautiful cities in the world!!!"
War memorial of Korea,"Very nice place, must visit and do it for full day. Best part is it is free. English speaking guide are available."
One of the best War Memorials I have visited!,"I thoroughly enjoyed visiting his war memorial. My son was only 5 and we walked around the venue quite well. It was a very well set out memorial. The displays of planes, ships and tanks were incredible and I had not seen it anywhere else in the world."
Excellent Memorial!,"This museum is a must see to learn about the history of Korea. Beautiful museum and memorial and nice display of airplanes, tanks and equipment outside with a children's play area for the little ones. Very nice."
A CHILLING REMINDER OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF WAR,"I spent 3 hours walking around The War Memorial, and quite honestly I left this place with deep sadness, and mystified that our world is being continually decimated, in the name of WAR. Why do so many people have to suffer and die, at the hands of DICTATORS. "
Massive War Museum,"This place has it all. Covering the early paleolithic days of Korea right up to the modern day, there is nothing about Korean civilization and its various wars that is overlooked. Inside, you'll find all the expected exhibits with uniforms, guns, maps, recreations, etc. Outside though, there is a massive array of planes, tanks, missiles, and even ships. Be sure to seek shelter under the B-52 for a spell if the Seoul summer heat becomes too much. The statues and parade ground are a nice touch as well. Overall, this is a must-see if you want to get a general grasp of Korea at war."
"Great displays for ""almost reliving"" the war :)","To give ""priority"" once you get inside this vast building are the three rooms of the Korean War on the second & third floors (to put in perspective, the ""entire display area"" of each of the Hiroshima & Nagasaki A-bomb museums I'm quite sure can ""almost"" be fit into just one of the three rooms upstairs here!) where you'll learn or actually ""almost relive"" the Korean War among impressive displays of ""quite-realistic looking"" wax sculptures (especially liked how those 3-D displays kind of ""blend in"" with the big background scenes behind them; you might have a hard time looking at your own pics later to tell which of the images are sculptures & which are part of the background scene!) such as those of: soldiers crossing the 38th Parallel, General Douglas MacArthur at a table with the first South Korean President, a soldier raising the South Korean flag in front of their Capitol building, children learning at a make-shift school outdoors and some reconstruction being done by civilians & soldiers with a background scene of the devastated city - all of which in my opinion are really well-thought-out displays that portray some of the important aspects & moments of the war ""as vividly as possible"". And to top off your ""almost reliving"" experience of the war, be sure to catch the 4-D show in one of the two rooms (either the Room I or the Room II) on the second floor - an ""absolutely outstanding"" (though only for about 10 minutes) documentary of the famous Incheon Landing (that decisively turned the tide of the war) with the great opening line ""I am General Douglas MacArthur, and I will bring hammer upon anvil"", and yes I can guarantee an ""up-close experience"" of sights & sounds of that landing as you can naturally expect from a 4-D show (the sounds of bombardment & such will be ""loud""!).The first floor though, if you're ""pressed for time"" (they close at 6 pm) after the great rooms upstairs, is where you can kind of ""walk through"" since there's not much to learn at the General War History room (with like prototype soldier & equipment displays of some Western nations as well but no theme of a ""particular war"" as the rooms upstairs), and there's the ""dark room"" for memorial purposes which is just meant to kind of pay respect & pass through; and for some ""ancient history"", there's the big ""time line"" of Korea all the way from like AD 100, the big painting of a battle scene of a pre-Joseon time which is actually lit up on & off for different parts of the painting (my favorite display on the entire first floor) and a replica of the famed Admiral Yi Sun Shin's turtle boat (a ""smaller replica"", I'm sure though, than the actual turtle boat).And outside the building, be sure to get to the right side of the grounds (the right side as you're facing the building or equivalently to your left after coming out of the building) where there are ""quite a number"" of military vehicles for land, sea & air (some tanks with ""really long"" cannons that I noticed); for the sea specifically though is only one big boat but it can be gone up on board where there's a 5-minute documentary of a naval incident that actually took place not too long ago (shown in 4-D just like the Incheon Landing documentary inside the building as mentioned above). And apart from those military vehicles, there are two big sets of sculptures (I believe one set represents the South & the other represents the North) with a tall monument between them on one end of the grounds (right by the street actually) straight from the building entrance on the other end and a two-brothers statue on like a lagoon (maybe supposedly a ""hill"", can be entered but nothing much inside) on the left side of the grounds (the left side as you're facing the building or equivalently to your right after coming out of the building) which is the opposite side of the grounds from the military vehicles. Also just outside the building entrance on each side are big plates with names of soldiers who died in the war (similar to the ""big wall"" at the U.N. Cemetery in Busan although the names here are on individual plates and not on a wall).Coming by subway, Samgakji Station (on Lines 4 & 6) is where to get off followed by just about a 5-minute walk and you'll be at the two-brothers statue; just do keep in mind it takes about 4 hours in total for both inside & outside and the 6 pm closing time, and I do suggest (as mentioned above) to start with the three rooms of the Korean War on the second & third floors; the outside can be done even after the closing time actually except maybe for going up the boat."
Spent a day here!,Spent over 7 hours wandering around looking at the vast arrangement of military equipment and reading all the information inside. Well worth spending the day trudging around in snow outside. This is a must see attraction. Free entry. 
interesting,"we joined a tour in english, and it was very interesting to learn about the war of the two koreas. it adds content to the trip."
"Leave plenty of time, there is lots to see",This one of the best memorials I have been to. Not everything in in English but more than enough to keep you busy for hours. Even some of the videos had a button so you could play them in English. I had 1.5 hours here and only managed to see the first floor. Didn't even get to see the lines of tanks/guns outside. I will have to return. The building and grounds will also need a bit of time. All this and it is free.
A place for picnic,Respect to the fallen heroes and heroines. The rows and rows of fallen heroes and heroines is quite a scene. Nice place for picnic. 
Great Museum--Free,Very informative museum with great displays of Korean wars from the past. It's free--who can ask for more than that?! Three floors x2. Most everything in English as well as Korean.
Well worth visiting,"Three floors of history, taking in the whole military history of Korea. Start on the ground floor left side and then follow the arrows. Great artifacts and the videos are worth watching ( you can select language). Korea was a country beset with wars of aggression against her culminating in the utter destruction of the Korean War, which makes her current (rightful) place at the top table all the more worthy of respect and admiration. "
Beautiful and Educational,"A well crafted and laid out museum, the War Memorial gives a thorough look at the young and violent history of Korea. Tons of stories and artifacts. Definitely a full day."
A must for military history enthusiasts,"A wonderful collection, from Korea's ancient history, regional struggles, the Korean War, to modern day. There is a fantastic replica of a Turtle Ship on the bottom floor, and a touching UN Memorial.You can really see how appreciative Korea is of the assistance received by UN forces during the Korean War. The outdoor installations including a B-52, a Mig, various tanks, helos and artillery. There was also a cute family of stray cats living in one of the planes.I spent hours here, alone, totally absorbed, and left with a greater appreciation and understanding, and some tears in my eyes.The only improvement needed is to the gift shop. Some good books in English on Korea's military history would be welcome!"
Great museum - learnt a lot,"I knew very little about the Korean war, but this museum tells you all you need to know. I was welcomed with an offer of a free English guide, very friendly. Museum is well made, text and animations, all in 2 languages."
Stop here for a bit of Korean War history.,"The War Memorial of Korea is located not too far from the Itaewon neighborhood of Seoul -- which is known as an international area as it is close to various embassies and US Army Garrison Yongsan. The memorial is very interesting, and you can spend as much or little time as you like here, taking it all in. Recommended for any balanced tour of Seoul and South Korea."
"The War Museum of Korea: A melange of a memorial, history lessons and video games centre",Large and well worth visiting and provide substantial information on wars which have plagued Korea since the earliest recorded times. It would be better named as a Museum than a Memorial.I guess exhibits such as the Incheon Landing 4D ride are worthwhile for engaging teenagers but more emphasis should be on helping people to reflect what has caused war in the past and how to avoid future wars.
A thing to do,"If you have some time you must go in the War memorial, is very far from European history (I'm italian) but for me has been very intersting.Is a big place to visit so take your time."
Great place to visit!,It was really incredible all the stuffs about the korean war history that was exposed in this museum!
History,"When visiting other countries, its best to learn its history and local culture and this place is one if your in South Korea."
Learned more about the korean wars,"We took about 2.5 hours at this musuem. Went for the free English guided tour and our guide was very sweet and gave good commentary. Do join the tour if you can. There was also an outdoor area where you can see ships, planes and tanks used in the wars. Worth a visit! "
Free and educational museum for those interested in Korean history and culture,I went in solo and I learned a lot. I would suggest everyone who visits Korea to come and check the place out. It talks about wars with Japan and the most recent war. Great place to visit with friends and to take pictures. This place is well worth the time spent walking around.
Great place to learn about the Korean War,"When I visited this place, I thought this is going to be any other museum and then this turned out to be one of the most amazing museum. This museum gave insights into the Korean War and also details regarding other nationalities involved in this war. Almost spent 4 hours at this place"
A must see for any visitor to Seoul,"Large museum which spans the Korean history, but with great focus on the most recent UN War with the North. Outside has some great aircraft including a B52. Put aside the entire day, or go more than once. Oh, and its FREE."
For war and history buffs: you'll enjoy this place!! :D,"Believe me, I've been to a LOT of war memorials, and I've had my share of days in museums. But going here was different. I should have planned to go there for two whole days, instead of just half a day. I learnt much about Korea's troublous history, and appreciated how things go in our present time.. For war and history people like me, don't forget to miss this place when you come to South Korea!"
"Free, in-depth museum","This museum is bigger than I expected! I only thought there would be exhibits covering a fairly recent time period, but the bottom floor of the museum goes back much further in time. There are 3 floors inside, and a variety of monuments and replicas outside. Definitely worth a visit, especially as it is free. Some of the rooms can be a bit repetitive. Overall, the museum is well designed and makes quite good use of technology (many 3D and 4D screenings!), so I think there will be something to capture everyone's attention. "
Seoulmate,Am so amazed with the different war memorabilia displays and other equipments used during the Korean war. 
Could be better...,"From Samgakji Station, we passed the Clock Tower of Peace and The Statue of Brothers at the West Gate. These are poignant reminders for visitors that peace must not be taken for granted. The memorial did a good job to present historical accounts in a chronological order without overwhelming details. The outdoor exhibition area is interesting but I was disappointed to see the replica of the PKM-class Chamsuri Warship. I expected the actual vessel.One major improvement badly needed is to put English translation of the Korean text. I understand the challenge as there are strong demand for Chinese and Japanese as well. Another aspect to consider is to tone down the rhetoric - maybe gradually with time. Some European museums have also exhibited atrocities committed by their own soldiers during colonial period.German museums and memorials displayed balanced presentations in explaining events leading to the world wars and reunification of Germany. This Memorial has a lot of potential and can start by toning down the rhetorics.Nevertheless, it is a good place to spend 2-3 hours to gain an understanding of the unfortunate geographical position of the Koreans."
Great education!,"After 20 year overseas marriage with a Korean finally visited probably the most important site in Korea. The amount, quality and coverage of information superb! Wish we'd visited 20 years ago..."
A typical Memorial,A typical Memorial. A museum is close to it. Easy access via Subway or Bus. Not a must see but good place to go if nothing to do.
Best Museum to visit in Seoul ,"This was a great place to learn about the conflict that has been a part of this country for thousands of years. It does present a very biased view of conflict, something you would not see in other museums of this type, but a good insight into the national identity of South Korea."
War history venue,"A place to go if one wishes to understand the context and detailed information on the Korea War, known to the South Korea as ""6.25 War"" as the North Korea launched the first assault on 25th of Jun. Fantastic exhibits with several 4D experiential theater shows. Besides the Korean War, there is also another exhibition hall that display the origin of Korean dynasties and history, dating back to the prehistoric era. One will get a good overview of historic Korea such as the ""3 Kingdom period"", Goguryeo, Joseon dynasties, as well as the 36 years of Japanese occupation. A must see exhibit for history buffs."
a Must See,"Unbelievable place. The information, art, coffee shop, and outside statues are all amazing. It tells the story of the Korean War through the eyes of the people involved, including almost the whole world. We had planned on half a day, but ended up a whole day there and still felt we missed some of the exhibits. If in Seoul this has to be part of your visit nad be sure to leave enough time. "
Great Museum ,Museum was free of charge. Easy to find and was very tech savvy. There were informational screens and movie rooms in multiple languages. This was a interesting visit filled with slot of history. 
Good museum to reflect on wars in Korea,"Visited the museum, quite impressed with the information and details provided on wars in Korea. I learned more and understood the Korean War now. Many good exhibits and video presentations too"
A glimpse of Korean past,A well documented war history. Highly recommended. Please allot at least 2 hours to explore the place. 
Impressive statues! ,"If you have some spare time this place is well worth visiting! Amazing statues plus a free outdoor museum with tanks, helicopters and fighterjets! "
Interesting,We think it is very interesting to visit the museum inside. Much written and graphic info well prepared.We missed some extra exhibitions that were outdoors previous times we went there. So before going it is useful to check in case you can see them.
A must see!!!,"This fee-free museum is a must see for anyone visiting this beautiful country. While much of the museum concentrates on the Korean War, there are other venues which looks at various other conflicts with particular emphasis on the Korean peninsula. Everything is in immaculate condition and the employees are very courteous. Please plan on spending at least two hours for the full experience."
Worth to go,"This place is actually quite big, we spend approximately 2 hrs there. It's a very good place to learn more about the olden Korea, how Korea has became so successful thought wars. Very big and nice in the inside, lots of mannequin and historical stuff. "
The War Memorial of Korea (전쟁기념관),"We read that this is a very good Museum so we traveled quite a bit to Itaewon to visit it. It is grand just from the outside; very large premises with some old/smaller planes, ships and military crafts displayed!. Not replicas but war-weary ones. Just outside the Museum proper is a large podium to commerate and paying tribute to the 20 plus Nations whom has fought alongside S Korea in the 1950s Korean Way. Flags flew high and it can emotional charging when one moves round to read all the inscriptions, sad stories…It “immortalized” the military history of modern Korea. The memorial building has six indoor exhibition rooms; Memorial Hall, War History, Korean War, Expeditionary Forces Room, ROK Armed Forces Room etc. Displayed are various weapons and equipment from prehistoric times to the modern period as well as paintings of battlefields and sculptures of notable warriors. It is a Memorial to all wars experienced by Korea, including the Vietnam War and Japanese occupation.What a visual treat for a War Museum like this!It was an amazing experience and we were not disappointed having spent close to 3 hours. And we have not covered everything!! This museum definitely worth a visit. It is free entry too."
A must visit in Seoul,"I made last minute decision to drop by this highly rated destination. Since I missed the English guide session, a high school volunteer, Sally took me for a tour. Learned the history of Korea and understood why South Korea continue to defend the country.. I feel the pain of the Koreans both north and south and hope one day the history will change. .... may be tough. You could take a walk around the building. 2-3 hours visit will be sufficient. "
Quite unexpected,"The memorial is a must visit. A showcase of Korean history of battles and war. Ranging from Shilla, Goryeo, Joseon and down right to the Korean warVery valuable lessons can be learn. "
A look back in time ,Great place to visit and learn about the Korean War. Very interesting and educational. The museum is very large and will take some time to get through it. Worth checking out
Excellent Memorial/Museum,"The Korean War Memorial is part memorial and part museum of the conflicts in Korea up to and including the sinking of the Cheonan and the current homegrown defence industry exhibits. There are a variety of videos and interactive exhibits to see while you are there. The exhibits of former military vehicles, armour, artillery and aircraft outside of the main building are well maintained and well signed. All in all well worth the visit."
Very informative peek into Korean History,It was a great visit. We spent about 2 hours. There is a short animation movie about the army/ navy which has regular shows. The museum is also very informative.
Must see. On par with Marine Corps Museum in Quantico.,"Ample english placards, very friendly staff. The planes, tanks, and weapons systems on display are impressive and fun for all ages to get up close to. The war history covered inside is incredibly well displayed in multiple mediums. This is a good experience for non-military, military, and children mature enough for seeing realities of war. "
Expected more,"It was ok, but I have seen better memorials. This one seemed lacking and was mediocre. I guess it is worth seeing if you haven't but don't have high expectations. "
Special Places in my 10 year stay in the Republic of South Korea.,Great re-visit of the Forgotten War....tells the story with excellent displays. Flows well and Historically is quite accurate.
Educative,The museum has been established well. A good 2-3 hours is required to have a look around. Gives a good insight into the dispute existing within the North and South.
In memory ,A nice place to go to remember those who fell and fought in the Korean War. Everything is immaculate. There are restored planes and tanks - any young fan of planes would love this (you can go right up to the cockpit and look in). Beautiful statue - everything beautifully pays respect to the war. A must see! 
An excellent museum,"The museum takes you through the history of Korean wars, all the way from the three kingdoms period until the Korean War. The exhibits are varied and plentiful and the signs are in both English and Korean. The videos dotted around the museum are also available in English, Korean, Chinese and Japanese. In the grounds of the museum there also many replicas of planes and tanks, and a replica warship you can explore. I would highly recommend the War Memorial for any history enthusiasts, or those curious about the Korean War."
Nostalgic!,great experience to know Korea's history. The whole museum is impressive! It's worth visiting. I got lost when I went there thru Namyeong Station so I suggest to use Line 6 Samgakji Stn. exit 1. It's very near and easy to locate. Just a 5 minute wwalk from the exit.
Great museum for families and history buffs,"I have been to the War memorial or what should be called the Korean War Museum multiple times. It has great exhibits, especially the planes and tanks out front. Most of the signage is in English and Korean so self guided is no issue. It is close to metro and bus stops, so also easy to get there. Highly informative with excellent exhibits."
"Interesting, very comprehensive museum, with nationalist overtones","This museum is certainly a very interesting place to visit for those interested in military history. It basically covers all the military conflicts Korea's been involved in (with a big part of the museum dedicated to the 1950-1953 war) in a lot of detail. There is a nationalist overtone to the museum, though, that I personally found a bit surprising."
Let's not forget!,"An important chronological display of the Korean War and all the wars prior in thousands of years of history.An impressive display of artilaries, planes, tanks and warship of different era.Very well designed building in both interior and exterior. Even got a kids playground.Easily to spend 2-3 hours there. Accessible by subway.Best of all, the price is right. "" free ""."
Very impressive museum,"This museum is very well done with great interactive displays that rival the World War I museum in Kansas City that is also a top class facility. They do not just focus on the Korean War, but cover everything from the earliest conquests of the mongols until activity with the currently on ongoing operations.We brought kids ages 6 and 9 and they were interested throughout. They really enjoyed looking into the aircraft and military vehicles outside the museum as well. There were a few 4D movies that the kids enjoyed as well. Best part about it is that it is free. No charge anywhere, which makes the overall display even more impressive. If you have limited time in Seoul, I would recommend this location be on your list."
Awesome place for some History,"I supposed a lot of tourists visit South Korea because of interest and influence from K-Pop. This is 1 place with free Entrance us tourists to find out more about their history, on top of just K-Pop.I've been to South Korea many times but have never visited this attraction.After my visit, I regretted not going earlier and I will visit again my next trip.The Museum provides free Guided Tour in English. Not too sure about other languages as we happened to chance upon the Guided Tour timing.There's 3 levels in the Museum and the Guided Tour is only for Level 1. It took more then 2 hours for the tour to end as it's very informative.There's also outdoor exhibits...If you are a Museum Go-er, half a day may not be sufficient if you were to take your time to go thru everything."
"Nice, but no book shop.","Good museum. A lot of the text was translated to English. I was offered a student docent. He was not a history student, and did not know much. He thought for instance that there had only been two battles for Seoul. But it was interesting to talk to him to get a sense of what young Koreans know and what they don't know.The museums does a great job remembering the UN forces. It had the names of the three Norwegians who died, for instance.But I was disappointed that there was no Museum shop there. Would have expected a book shop, at least."
Great Opportunity to Learn and Enjoy Korea's History,"I'll be honest, I didn't want to visit another museum. I've been to plenty in my life, but this was one of the most memorable ones for me. My husband and I were in Korea for a few days in October and we walked here from our hotel one afternoon. We spent a good couple of hours walking around. It's free too! I learned so much about the Korean war. It was nice doing this before my husband and I did our DMZ/JSA tour. My favorite exhibit was actually outside the building. It was a depiction of a real life incident of two brothers in the Korean War where they were on opposite sides and reunited in combat. The crack is the separation of the north and south. It symbolizes the Korean wish for reunification. Basically, I would highly recommend walking around this museum. It's very well done without glorifying war and honors those who have fought."
Great war memorial - learnt a lot,We decided to visit the Korean War Memorial after taking a day trip to the DMZ.It was a good lesson particularly on the Korean War.The outdoor exhibition of military equipment was also very interesting.We spent about 2 hours in the museum - and could have easily spent another hour there if we were not rushing off to another place.
Wonderful balance of respect and weaponry ,"Wonderful balance of respect and weaponry. Sit under the wings of a B52, and see every piece of military hardware used in conflicts to keep the peace and make peace! Respect for those who have given their lives for the country are beautifully presented in wonderful sculptures. "
Good visit for history lovers,"I recommend this place for any visitors who wants to learn more about the Korean war.There are English tour guides but they start at 2pm, but it can be visited without a tour guide as everything is written in English."
Not Just the Big One,"FREE ENTRY! The museum is mainly focused on the Korean War. It also had exhibits for Pre-Korean War, and what the current Korean Military is doing and how they have contributed manpower to UN missions.IF YOU GO: Bring your passport. They have an audio guide for rent. From what I could tell it was about $3USD. I didn't have my passport with me, so I couldn't get it."
Awesome Museum,This museum is really great. It is huge. We really enjoyed the way it was broken up into different sections in regards to time of the war. It was very informative and interesting. Highly recommend a visit here. 
The attractions outside the museum make it worth going,"Came here on a monday when it was closed, however the museum was still good. The statues were outside, and all the tanks, cars and planes were outside so you can still have a good time"
"Expansive and Informative if You Are ""Into"" It","This place is huge. Well done sculptures of soldiers outside. Many, many tanks, missiles, planes, etc on display outside. Inside lots of munitions and Kim Il Sung's limo! Some very nicely done dioramas of the Viet Nam war inside. There is a lot to see. When we were there first week of October 2016 we were the all alone. Entry is free."
Must visit Museum - Freedom is not free,"A must visit museum in SeoulSamgakji station line 6 exit 12( exit from the train and walk straight, you will see a sign showing direction to Museum Wedding hall and just walk straight. You will see the The Statue of Brothers(Monument).Outdoor and Indoor museum. A 3 story museum(if i don't recall wrongly) need about 3-4hours(to slowly read and watch the short clips). There is theater on short movie about 20 mins. Outdoor exhibition is the airplanes, tanks used in past wars including the Chamsuri ship PKM-35. Amazing place to see and read on the experience and memories of the past wars.A place to remind us that FREEDOM is not FREE"
Very touching ,"This is a must see if you are in Seoul. It's not something I would normally go to but honestly it is so well put together it's worth every minute. It's free but of course you can make a donation. It honours not just the Koreans lost in the war but also the thousands of Americans and mentions every European by name. Very modern and interactive, I thought half an hour would cover it and an hour and a half later we left reluctantly. Very easy to get around so good for young and old alike"
Super History Complex,"This huge complex consist of indoor memorial, outdoor military gallery and kids zone. This is a must visit place if you come to Seoul. I'm using a Seoul sightseeing bus facility to reach there. "
Glad we went before our DMZ/JSA tour.,"We had booked the full day DMZ tour with JSA/Panmunjong. My husband has a good history knowledge of the Korean War, but not me. So going to the War Memorial gave me a 'crash course' on the Korean War and added value to our DMZ/JSA tour. We arrived after the English speaking tour had begun, but because we went on Sunday, they have volunteer student guides and one of them took us through the highlights of Level 2 on the Korean War. We then walked Level 3 on our own. We had skipped Level 1 which is on the ancient wars before the Korean War. Outside of the museum in the open space, there is a very good display of exhibits of the airplanes & tanks used in the War. The museum is closed on Monday. Entrance is free. Do check from their website for the timing of the guided tours."
Memories of war,"Amazing place.. you can see a lot of memories from the past war.Before you reach the building which you can see a lot of war memorial things, outside you can see first the planes which the souldiers used.Outside the building you'll see the statues of the souldiers and flags of diff. countries and inside you can see a lot of things like arcs,artifacts,dresses,guns etc."
Excellent even on a closed day.,"If you know the KR War, the memorial does not fail to impress. We went unaware it was a closed day. We still had access to the grounds. What is impressive are the military relics you'll encounter without being on a military base. The UN flags out front inform of participating nations, their input, & sacrifices. The metallic monuments are stunning & larger than life."
Propaganda palace?,"a bit of a one-sided museum, naturally but would have been good if the North Korean perspective can be elaborated and explained. "
History of the Korean War in reality,"Visited this place right after my DMZ/JSA tour with Koridoor since their office is located close by. I could spend an entire day in here going through the models of planes, tanks etc. and war artifacts displayed in this memorial. It is a VERY informative place to learn about the history of Korea and the Korean War."
Good place to learn the war history of Korea ,This place has remodel war machines used during the Korean War. Very informative place to learn about history of Korea.
Business Trip,"The War Memorial of Korea provides guided tours with guides who were directly affected by the Korean War (1950-1953). The tour guides provide a unique perspective on the ""Forgotten War."" The controversial General MacArthur, who was removed by President Harry Truman, remains a hero in the minds of many Koreans who are alive today. "
Visualizes korean war in reality,War memorial is a kind of war museum which exhibits war equipment and depicts the war field and related historical facts. War planes used during Korean are halted outside the memorial.
"Expansive, beautifully done war memorial","South Korea really does seem to do museums and memorials right. The War Memorial is in a gigantic, expansive building. It also seemed like some areas of the building were not yet completed or there was still room for more exhibits. The outside grounds were also immaculately taken care of, with numerous statues (esp. the Korean War Monument, Statue of Brothers), a humongous area (circle) in front of the museum with the flags of the nations that participated with South Korea in the Korean War, and more.The inside is quite moving in places, especially the Memorial Hall which is quite unique and haunting. There are numerous exhibits and rooms. I would suggest around at least 2-3 hours for a fairly decent circuit of the place. There is a cafe in the place, although I didn't try it. The admission was also free when I went."
Teenagers Loved It!,My teenage boys couldn't get enough of this museum and memorial. Allow enough time in your schedule - they could have stayed all day. Actual tanks and fighter jets in the outdoor part of the museum that you can access. Indoors the exhibits were state-of-the-art and you can actually experience live combat. We all left with a better perspective and understanding of why the US fought in the Korean War.
A record of suffering,The War memorial of Korea records the suffering of the Koreans during the war. The memorial also record the countries who helped Korea during the wars and their gratefulness is recorded in the Memorial Hall listing the names of those who died from the different countries. The various armaments used have been preserved for the people to be oriented and keeping the history alive. As tourist it is to appreciate their struggle to keep peace and a desire for unification with the help of other countries. It are closed on Monday. Admission is free. to really appreciate do it in a leisurely manner and read the description and history posted.
"History and Wars at the War Memorial of Korea in Seoul, South Korea","We got there in the afternoon of October 21st looking to visit this museum and we were delighted to see that there was also a free performance outside by members of the armed forces and people in traditional costumes marching and performing synchronized moves, fights with historic weapons and dancers in traditional dresses with their musical instruments. The memorial tells the history of Korea from the absolute beginning centuries ago to the independence in the 50's. There are cars, military vehicles and planes on display on the top floor and boats on the bottom one. There are many pictures, artifacts, videos and explanation panels (many only in Korean) that tell the story of battles and struggles of this beautiful country. I believe this is really a highly recommended visit for any tourist coming here."
A must see,"Both, beautiful and sad at the same time. The history behind the monument is so very touching. How families were split and to never see each other again..There is always hope. "
In memory of those who suffered,"This was a little personal.Had just lost my grandfather who was in the Army,so visiting this memorial which had a little Indian contribution in terms of Med Corps during the Korean War choked me up a bit too.There's some awesome weaponry on display such as coner-shot rifles,super soldiers etc and the Koreans are not shy of displaying them.One can even take photos of these.This coupled with a brief history of the peninsula from the Bronze Age onwards including the Goryeo,Silla,Baekje,Gaya dynasties and their wars with Japan and the Tang dynasty of China all make up for an interesting day."
Highly recommended.,"We spent 3 hours here and really enjoyed the outside exhibits, statues and memorials. Historically and culturally interesting."
"An amazing place to visit, full of history and promise for the future","Spent a whole day at this wonderful museum and could of comeback the next day too. Poignant to see the dedications to all the countries and their soldiers at the front of the museum, as my grandfather served in this war during his national service. very easy to get to and some good eating to be had in the local area. "
Worthwhile visit to the War Memorial,"The War Memorial is far from the metro station. Get a taxi. This is a very organised museum. Outside there are many planes, army tracks etc with English and Korean labels. Inside the exhibits are clearly labelled, some very good audio-visual presentations."
"Nice ""time-travel"" feel","Went here recently and it felt good to remember the sacrifices made to secure our generation's safety. Loved the vintage and historical cars, tanks and jets. :)"
Wonderful Museum,"I could have stayed here all day. There is so much to see and read. We started outside with the planes - we had a 3 year old in tow. She loved going up into the tanks and on the ship. There was a little children's play area and children's museum too, but we didn't make it into the children's museum. The museum was incredible. So much information. We didn't get to stay long looking at all the exhibits because of the above mentioned 3 year old. And, this museum was free! Amazing! Highly recommend taking the time to visit here."
very big place!,"Lots of history here. Not only to the South Korean people, but to the NATO alliance. You can spend many hours here is you truly want to, and there are large displays of military hardware to look at as well. "
Quite a History!,"The War Memorial is a museum of artifacts and displays of the fantastic history of the Korean Peninsula, including the Hideyoshi invasions of 1592 and 1598 and the Korean War of 1950 - 53 which ended not in a peace treaty but rather in an Armistice Agreement.All sorts of displays are presented, including weapons systems and the famous Turtle Boat. The museum is located near the former Japanese Army compound currently the home of the United Nations Command, the ROK/US Combined Forces Command, and U.S, Eighth Army.Well worth visiting. If you want to see it all, plan on an afternoon, since it's easy to get distracted by all the exhibits."
Historical value,"We visited towards the end of the day, but still worth it. The park in the middle of the city reminds its citizens of the devastation of war. The monuments are poignant memory for the sacrifices of the soldiers from allied countries as well. Every Koreans must visit this park!"
Lots of history and interesting presentations,If I hadn't been in a group I would've stayed here for so long. I really liked seeing the model of the turtle ship. It's wonderful.
Very Moving on the Korean War,"I went to the War Memorial for the Korean War memorials. My husband served in the U.S. Army and was part of the U.N. Forces. My trip was a tribute to his service and the sacrifices that he made during the year he spent here.I concentrated on the area about the Korean War. The story of the war was told with many pictures and artifacts. All the U.N, Forces were represented in the display.It is well worthing seeing. It helped me understand why people would stop me on the street and says thanks for our country helping South Korea retain their freedom."
Very enjoyable visit,"We arrived at 10am to get a tour of the museum by an English speaking guide. Turns out it was a volunteer Grade 10 student who was trying to share information with tourists and practice English at the same time. Kevin, the guide, was very polite and courteous. He spent time with us through many exhibitions, even though he was only supposed to take us through two. He didn't know too much about the actual history, but he was able to offer some translations and also share his personal stories about the war with us. We asked him some questions about North Korea and he provided some very interesting insights!The museum is large, and we could have easily spent over 3 hours there. The exhibitions are very informative and well designed, and certain parts can be very emotional. Great place to learn more about the Korean War and Korean history in general. One of the highlights of our Seoul trip!"
War Memorials,War memorials are normally solemn places to visit and more so this particular one as it showed how people of the same race fighting over two ideology and a nation divided between North and South Korea.
Korean History,Different periods of Korean history - take time to visit :) we spent about 4 hours both outdoor and indoor.There are many well-known retired warplanes showcase in the outdoor - great for the younger ones and even we adults took interest in it too.
Best War Museum I Have Visited,"Entrance is free,three floors inside that have very detailed history of the Korean war. Outside has lots to see including a F4 Phantom,a B52D,F101,Sabre, and lots more tanks,APC's and even a PT boat. Allow at least a full day"
Great place to learn a bit about modern Korean history,"Impressive museum of Korean history and especially civil war in 1950s. Offers really thorough explanation inside and lots of stuff to see. In front of the museum are monuments for all countries which were involved in the war, of course just the western one helping South Korea. With number of fallen soldiers or explanation how each country supported (army or engineers for example). Near the main gate are also all known names of all foreign soldiers (again, only those who helped South Korea) who fallen in this war.When your tour inside is over, you can visit open air museum with military airplanes, cars, boats. Place to spend almost one whole day! I really recommend.Just leave your political views somewhere else and don't bring it inside - I've met a group of Russian tourists and their guide told them the Soviet version of how everything happened - just telling them bullsheet and lying."
peace full,place to memorise the soldiers who die in war against japan and north koreaplease be quiet thereyou should go there if you like to fell sorry people.
A must visit with further attractions,"The memorial itself is impressive, but it also has a park of military plans next to it, which is impressive in itself.Would definitely recommend."
"excellent museum - interesting, well laid out and plenty of english explanations","we spent 2 hours here but could have spent longer if we'd not left it till the end of the day and were tired. Excellent chronology of Korea's conflicts from BC to present day. For the latter stages there are video's, tableaux and plenty of written explanations. Free to enter but well worth leaving a donation"
War history brought to life,"This is by far the best war memorial/museum I have ever been to. I suggest allowing at least half a day (preferably a full day) too see it properly as there is a lot to see, spread over 3 floors. There are 2 cafe's on site if you need a rest and food/coffee. Aside from many fascinating exhibits, there are multiple theatrettes showing short information videos, as well as 2 small cinemas, including one that offers a 4D experience of the battle to recapture Seoul. There is also an interactive photo stand on the upper floor that allows you to take your photo and put it onto a background picture of a soldier or battlefield. There are also memorials to many fallen heroes and tributes to the allied nations who helped the Koreans fight. We were also lucky to also see a military parade in progress outside before entering. Well worth it, and easy to access using public transport. Entry is free."
Lots to see,Very interesting history of the Korean war and we'll as earlier battles. Recent conflict with North Korea also covered. Lots of original military equipment outside as well as huge war monuments around the memorial.
Must See,"Must see attraction for tourists coming to Seoul. Not too difficult to find and huge array of history, weapons etc... from all eras."
Excellent tribute to the war heroes of that country.,Very well arranged. The sculptures are magnificent! There's a large variety of weaponry on display from several wars. From a vintage patton tank to a B52 stratofortess to a scud missile and a small gun boat. It was a very interesting visit.I enjoyed it very much.
Awesome place,I like that place so much. I want to visit there again. I wish I could have enough money to visit...
Must visit for all history buffs!,A huge museum on Korean history and in depth knowledge on the Korean War in 1950s. Lots of interesting artifacts and there is two 4D cinema for you to experience the Korean War.The entrance is free and is about 10 mins walk from the nearest metro subway.
Such a nice place to visit.,"The museum not only explains the most recent Korean War, but the whole war related history of Korea. The outside has real planes and tanks used during the Korean War."
"Worth visiting: Free entry, interesting exhibits, okay with kids","Great gardens worth walking around and looking at sculptures / open exhibits.Museum itself is just a short walk from the subway (take Exit 13 - which is the closest - or if you're coming from Line 4, then Exit 1 and walk towards the signs) Entry is free (donation boxes inside). You enter on the 2nd floor. The ground floor (1st floor) covers the ancient wars to Korean War, and has a great overall timeline of what was happening in Asia and the rest of the world.2nd and 3rd floors cover the Korean War. It's best if you walk in chronological direction (from the 2nd to the 3rd floor - War room 1 to 3, and then UN exhibit). There were many interesting exhibits, enough to engage children and adults alike. It wasn't as graphic and traumatising as some war memorials I've been to. There are many guns for display, in case this may be an issue (might want to have a prep talk with the kids outside about what this is about, before going in anyway).There is a coffee shop and lots of vending machines, which, at around 1200 won for Coolpis and the likes were slightly overpriced but still cheap and convenient. There's also a CU25 on the grounds.Slightly disappointed that we couldn't go into any of the cinemas (what it felt like to be a refugee with windstorms experience, a 20 minute movie, and also a 4D experience of one of the battles - the latter probably not for kids). The shows mostly started on the hour, but they needed a minimum of 5 adults in the audience for them to run the show. So mostly, it was empty and they didn't play anything. When we had gathered a big enough group, it was 1 minute past the hour and we were told we were too late and had to wait another hour, by the lady who was also chatting on her cellphone while the theatre sat empty. But there were plenty of other interactive things, buttons to press, other short films you could see in booths (including a very touching one about a Turkish soldier and his wife who had raised a Korean War orphan / and a war heroes one where an American soldier had rescued many refugees by being clever with his ship).Plan to spend about 2-3 hours here all up if you're into history / about an hour and a half (including time running around in the grounds) if you have children with you. Worthwhile visit."
Amazing and Sobering at the same time.,"This museum gives you a glimpse into the war torn History of Korea's past. It helps you to understand why things are the way they are now, the many hurdles they have had to overcome and who the Koreans are on a deeper level.The multitude of exhibits within and without will give your hours of things to explore.And as with most museums in Korea it is free!!!Oh and they have a replica of a Turtle Ship which is a major plus. Even my father who is a major war history buff learned a lot during his visit.A must see in Seoul.Sorry no pictures but the Museum respectfully asks you not to on most of the inner displays and I don't want to steal their ahow"
A must visit place if you love History.,"I'm someone who's always been interested in History especially that of a country. I didn't have much anticipation when I decided to go to the war memorial but the moment I was there, it was like a small kid being brought to a huge exciting playground. Tanks, airplanes and boats displayed outside with meaningful statues were those that appeared in sight when I arrived. I was already hyped up even before I entered. Looking through at the exhibits, I regretted for not spending more time there although I was there for more than 2hrs. I didn't go to all the exhibitions since I had other places to go but I will come back again. Even if it's for the same exhibitions. That is how awesome the place was."
Informative interesting visit ,"Well laid out museum with interesting, thoughtful exhibits. Definitely worth a visit to learn about the history of the Korean War. We especially liked the tanks, airplanes and machinery displayed outside. "
Spectacular!,"Very spectacular war memorial in Yongsan for a war that is considered the ""forgotten war"" in the US but certainly not in South Korea..."
Patriotism coupled with Technology,"If you are in and around Seoul, chop off 3 hrs from your busy schedule and do visit war memorial. Before stepping in, i had no idea of what the age old korean war is all about. Even the minute details of the war are showcased with finest clarity. They showed their respect to all the martyrs of the war. 4D film of the war proceeding was the absolute delight. Technology has been used to wide extent to portray all the information. "
everything about the korean war,"I hate wars and everything that has something to do with it, so I don't even like war museums, because they sometimes are a bit patriotic or even glorify the war.And yes, you sometimes get exactly this feeling, when visiting this musuem, but still it's a big and interesting museum, with a lot of things to look at.We didn't had much time, when we went there, but you can really get lost in all the exhibitions. The entrance is free, so you can't go wrong - leave if you don't like it."
Good to have a guide,"My time there was made meaningful with a personal guide arranged by my travel agent. Unfortunately, there were also other tour guides who had students and army boys there too and they were a bit noisy. The place is a bit warm for me as it didn't seem to have air conditioning. They offered a free book about the war. It was too heavy and thick and I didnt lug it back."
Amazing museum,"If you want learn a great deal about this incredible country, visit this museum! There are some great displays and some moving moments."
Don't miss visiting it.,I spent a day there between the outside and inside exhibits. Free tours in the main museum explaining the origins and course of the Korean War. The war Memorial of Korea was the highlight of my visit to Seoul. Well worth a visit.
Check out the military show,"I got lucky, but on Fridays (It might just be in the autumn) they have a military show which showcases the history of the Korean military. A highly orchestrated hour of the various eras of Korean war history, from ancient sword and spear demonstrations to the marching of modern military honour guards. It's done in a massive circular space in front of the actual memorial building and makes for a spectacular event to go and see. "
Awe- inspiring.," This war memorial is stunning. There is a statue of two soldiers one a South Korean in full army gear, embracing another poorly dressed North Korean soldier, they are brothers. Inside are the countries engraved in bronze with their name and the contribution of men, arms, The roof has a beautiful coloured frieze in an abstract design. The main building has the names of every military person who died fighting to keep South Korea free on bronze columns. In the courtyard are the flags and a monument, flag and contribution of each U.N. country that fought. On the grounds are many planes, guns and tanks, plus a replica of the patrol boat that was attacked by North Koreans in early 2000. It is amazing only six sailors died when the bullet holes are seen. I left the memorial thinking about all those brave men who fought and died in the name of freedom. "
Quite impressive collection of war artifacts,"Very interesting display of tanks and aircrafts from Korean War and from modern times including a huge B52. A great time to spend with your kids, specially if they are into ""Call of Duty"""
"Very interesting, well appointed and maintained","We visited this free museum and probably spent as much time outside as inside. The outside displays (planes, tanks, guns, boats, etc) are very well preserved and there was actually ongoing maintenance of one of the planes while we were there.The inside has sections for various themes such as the Korean war, captured enemy weapons and artifacts, Korea's role in foreign wars like Vietnam, desert storm, etc, and other themes. The displays were very well done and thorough. For example, providing a cutaway sample of an antitank missile. Most of the signs included at least a rudimentary English description. We spent about 3 or 4 hours there and did not see half as much as we'd like to have. We will have to go back some time."
Visit My Father-in-laws Grave.,My father in law was killed in Vietnam in 1969 and it is traditional for Koreans to honor deceased relatives. My wife is from Korea and after visiting the grave went to see the grave sites of past Presidents to include the first President of Korea Syngmun Rhee.
Very impressive museum - plan to spend 2 - 3 hrs there,very impressive and well designed museum. The history is explained via animations on several floors. There is a large car / tank / jet / ship park outside. A must visit when in Seoul
National propaganda in poor wrapping,When I visited there was no audio guide and the smart phone based system is not supported by wifi. In general the exhibition is difficult to get an overview for people new to the topic. What's worse is that it is very nationalistic in its tone and there is absolutely no self reflection on atrocities committed by the South. The North is the big Evil and the South is the rightful Hero. Tastes bad.
"Huge, moving museum.","This museum covers every conceivable aspect of Korea's military history, but focuses most on the Korean War and a consideration of the sacrifices made in that conflict. The range of weaponry is staggering, especially outside, where the scale and power of modern technology can be experienced up-close. It also contains moving tributes to fallen soldiers, art exploring war itself and in-depth looks at South Korea's modern military. AND there are parades and shows to see. All for FREE. This is a truly great, if sombre, museum."
The war that i never really knew about..,"Ok in all honesty, I've heard of the Korean war but i didn't really know much about it until i came here and boy am i glad that i did. We travelled to this memorial/war museum on our 2nd day in Seoul and it was very easy to get to, i believe we took the subway line to samgakji and walked about 5 minutes up and around the hill where we found it. There was no entrance fee which we found surprising considering the massive size and the attention to historical detail of it all (you literally have nothing to lose here, we would have been more than happy to pay at least 10$ each). There are statues depicting heroic scenes and memorial plaques to commemorate and honour the fallen in battle everywhere. The one thing that really surprised me about it was all the plaques that honoured the foreign soldiers lives that fought and gave their life for the war in Korea, I never knew how many nations were actually involved. Inside there is a museum that holds some of the historical weapons used dating back to periods 2 millennia before the birth of christ, up to modern day weapons used in the most recent conflicts. You will learn about the different korean dynasties, the different wars and conflicts with which nations which ultimately lead to the birth of the modern day Korea."
Most interesting Museum in Korea,"Very impressive depiction of the Korean separation and their suffering. It is beautifully shown how they want to be reunited again and a crucial visit to understand the Korean feelings towards war, North Korea and brotherly love. A free experience. A must-do. And pick a sunny day, then you can have a look at the backyard filled with an incredible collection of old warfighters (planes), tanks and boat and flacs."
Interesting cultural destination ,One get to know about pretty much everything on Korean War but may not be from a neutral perspective. Interesting exhibit but do expect a lot of walking though. 
Beautiful memorial,This is a very moving and beautiful memorial. It's free to see ( along with quite a bit on the property) but if you take a minute to really look at the art behind this and see the true meaning of the piece you will be moved. It is exceptional.
Fantastic - must visit,Lovely environment for a leisurely walk soaking in the history of the place with significant landmarks and accessibility. Strongly recommended.
Interesting and Moving,We went to lots to tourist attractions in the seven days we had in Seoul and I would rate this as one of the best. The old history was really interesting and there was plenty of English commentary to keep us interested. The installations that covered the Korean War were equally interesting and one - I'll call it the tear drop as I have not idea what is actually called - was particularly moving. I'd recommend adding this to your itinerary.
haunting yet respectful,"we walked around for at least 4 hours. this is an excellent memorial and museum for the wars of Korea. some rooms are haunting. all are extremely respectful. I recommend any visitor to Seoul, spend a few hours here. "
Good to see for the value! Free!,This is a must see if you're very into history of the war that has happened in Korea. We spent about a good couple hours here. Be prepared to walk a lot as this museum is HUGE. The great thing about this place was it was FREE entry. It's very easy to get here as well as we took the subway only about 10 minutes from where we stayed (Tmark Grand Hotel). 
Great museum,"It's nice that most of the museums in Seoul are free which is the same asthe museums in Washington, DC. The war museum is free to enter and a very nicely organized museum. It's easy to follow the time line and I learned a lot about the war from my visit. It is great for kids because they have a children's museum and an outdoor playground for the kids."
"Intersting, but very little in English","The outside exhibits were great. Interesting, English available, and lots to see. The inside was harder, more ancient history than I was expecting, and too many school groups. (The kids do sit on the floor and pay attention to their guides though!) I'd plan to spend a hour or two here. Lots to learn."
A great insight into Korea's history and the people's psyche,"This museum is very nicely set up. It goes through the very old history of Korea and all of its conflicts over the centuries. About half the museum focuses on the Korean War, but that's expected. They did a very good job of showing their appreciation to all the nations that helped South Korea retain independence from the North. Of course, there are things that are biased in this exhibit, but that's expected. Be sure to stop by as it's free so worth the visit."
You can learn about war & peace through various displays that are historically proven.,There you can learn about the Korean War (Forgotten War in American term) in detail if you particularly are interested and see various weapons actually actually used during the war together rwith all papers/maps etc. exhibited inside & outside of the museum.
Amazing,If your old enough to remember the war don't miss it. Every day they have several tours in English and another nice thing admission is free
Unexpected pleasure,"Having visited the Korean War Memorial in Washington DC. we wanted to visit the memorial in Seoul. We were not disappointed. It is very impressive! As we emerged from the main building we realised they were preparing for a ceremony, so we found a seat, and at 2pm promptly we watched the Honour Guard Ceremony. It was quite spectacular! So glad we were around to witness it."
"This is massive! If you want to see it all, leave enough time","We came here in the afternoon after a few other sight-seeings.The museum is huge so if you don't have a lot of time, chose which part to visit wisely!I only came here because my husband asked me to but I loved it. It has a lot on the Korean war and other things related to wars. Well worth a visit."
Interactive and Insightful,"A great place to spend a couple of hours learning about the Korean War. Loads of mock ups and interactive videos which make it all the more interesting, particularly if you have children. There is a great selection of outdoor exhibits too, including military aircraft and vehicles as well as thought provoking statutes. For real history buffs you could easily spend a whole day here, looking at other exhibits too."
Surprisingly interesting,I just went here because I was bored one day and was pleasantly surprised. The memorial is full of information that I never knew. This is recommended for history buffs or anyone who has a relative who was involved in the Korean War.
Memorable ,Recommended visit. A lot to see and learn from the war memorial. Have a better appreciation of the history and the sacrifices of the honoured
Excellent way to understand Korean history,"The War Memorial has an excellent display of historical artefacts and the outdoor exhibit is fantastic. As a tourist, this site is a must see and provides some context to the Korean War, a very important event in the history of South Korea.We were short on time but for a family, this can be a good activity for half a day. It is very easy to navigate to the site via the railway."
Fantastic Outdoor Exhibit,"Pros: Excellent collection of war planes and tank, outdoor exhibits are free to visitCons: Lots of school groupsI had a few hours while on a business trip in Seoul, and stopped by the War Memorial on a beautiful October afternoon. I had originally planned to visit the exhibition hall, but the weather was so nice I started outside and before I knew it, 90 minutes had passed.The outdoor collection of guns, missiles, tanks, planes, and a boat is very well maintained compared to other outdoor exhibits I have been to. Each item has a plaque in front with a detailed explanation of the item, its origin and history, and it's use during the Korean War. You can walk up and to in the equipment, and many items even have observation steps so you can see above or inside. There is also a boat you can tour, set above the reflecting pool next to the museum.I can't comment on the Exhibit Hall, since I ran out of time to visit it. But the outdoor exhibit alone was a great experience, and with no cost to attend it's hard to pass up."
"Solemn, yet spectacular. A must see experience.",The Korean War memorial is a massive site dedicated to those that fought and gave their lives to defend South Korea from communist North Korea and China. The displays are awesome and the sculptures capture the struggles both South Korean soldiers and civilians endured throughout the war. We saw hundreds of young military soldiers and students at the memorial probably to learn about the war and why they need to stay vigilant to protect their freedom. It's remarkable how much South Koreans suffered during the war and how they rebuilt their nation to what it is today in just 63 years. The memorial will forever remind future generations of the price of freedom. You must visit this remarkable site.
About The Korean War,"I visited the Exhibittion Hall at the War Memorial, Yongsan in Seoul. The sculptures are the memory of the Korean War, the clock stopped the hour of the beginning of the Korean War. You can see the flags and statues of many countries which joined the war. Many special exhits are at the exhibit halls and be able to see the unique ship, called Trutle Ship at Chosun dynasty. Walking around the Memorial makes you feel and think about the peace and war. Good in all season except winter."
"Great visit, even for those not interested in War Memorials","It's free to visit, so why not stop by? Even if you just go for the walk around of the mostly Korean War equipment pieces they have on display outdoors it's worth the 1/2 hour alone.One complaint, if you will, is the thin amount of material on the Korean War. I know, there are 3 entire rooms devoted to it, but in actuality there isn't all that much ( outside of the vast equipment on display outside ). For a country so war torn in it's long history, a visit here gives one perspective and appreciation for what they have gone thru, and, with the help out outside nations, retained- minus, of course, the northern half of the country."
Great kids museum and exhibits.,The entire museum is pretty great. Our kids loved the outdoor stuff and children's museum. There are weird height requirements for the children's area- but we took our baby and let him play around even though he wasn't tall enough. They didn't seem to mind. Our other kids enjoyed it a lot. They only let you in for 50 minute periods that start watching hour- and when it's busy you may have to wait to get in- but we went on a weekend morning and it was empty!
Insightful and engaging,We took up the offer of a free guide (look around at the entrance as was not clearly visible). This made our experience very insightful.
Most important historical tour place in modern Seoul,"As everyone knows, Korean war is very important historic event in Korea.This place can suggest you historical facts and circumstances of Korean war with selected references "
A spectacular show of the war history of Korea,This location is a must-visit for anyone interested in war history. The museum is well funded and laid out - going over the many centuries of battles that shaped the historical landscape of the Korean peninsula.
Impressive,"Korea underwent 50 years of brutal Japanese occupation and then, after WWII, came the Korea War. There is much to remember and it is very well displayed.Access to wheel chairs. Free admission."
Well done museum,"I only had 1.75 hours there which wasn't enough. I'd recommend at least 3 hours. Entry is free. The tanks, planes (including a B-52), missiles, etc. outside of the museum can be seen after the museum closes, so save them for last. I enjoy my history but this museum still had plenty of interesting information to offer on the Korean war. It also covers ALL Korean wars from ancient times through to today's military, but the Korean war takes up a lot of real estate as a three part exhibit (give yourself a couple hours for the Korean war exhibit if you have high interest).Some of the exhibits are interactive or moving, plus there is some sound and cinema, to make it a more interesting experience.If you enjoy history at all, you can't miss this museum."
Truly an eye opener,"An interesting place.. you can get a glimpse into south Korea's past. From the ancient eras to the Korean war. Didn't know that the nation went thru such difficult times...Really interesting exibits on display. From ancient battleship, war gear to modern tanks and bullets. It's amazing. It also showcases old antique pieces donated by those who took part in the war. The whole place is HUGE! Didn't know that a war could be so sadistic."
Huge war museum for a rainy day activity,"I have been to the Armed Forces Museum in Taipei, Taiwan before, and compared to that, I must say that the War Memorial of Korea is really huge. It is conveniently located next to either Namyeong Station or Noksapyeong Station. The museum can be a good addition as a next stop afterwards if you have a prior Koridoor DMZ or JSA tour, since the Koridoor office is very close to Namyeong Station itself.The indoor section of the museum itself consists of 3 floors of various exhibits, from the ancient period such as the Three Kingdoms of Korea to the modern day. Of course, the highlights in the exhibits are heavily focused on the Korean War, which is often known as the Forgotten War due to the more well known Vietnam War overshadowing it. There are plenty to see within the exhibits, such as firearms, uniforms and scale models of military vehicles. Sometimes, there are also special exhibits that are shown for a limited time. In our case, the museum held a special exhibition regarding firearms used by actors or actresses in Korean films. It was very fascinating to see rather unique firearms close-up first hand.There is also the outdoor section of the museum, which display various military vehicles, artillery and aircraft, and even a replica 1:1 scale of a South Korean patrol boat. The amount of vehicles here is simply astonishing and well preserved. You can see both Western and Soviet tanks and aircraft, such as the M4 Sherman and T-34, or even the massive B-52 Stratofortress jet bomber! You can even go into the back of the APCs, such as the M113, for some memorable photos. There is definitely plenty of stuff for everyone to take photos with.I would recommend at least 2 hours just to cover the inside of the museum itself, and it is very ideal for a rainy day activity. However, do take note it is closed on Mondays though. For those with an interest in military history or those who want to know more about the Cold War legacy that still continue to plague the Korean Peninsula, this is a must go. Best of all, it is free!"
Awesome museum,"Amazing exhibits with English translations. So much to see here. The collection of planes, tanks, and artillery outside the museum are great for photo ops. We came on a national holiday and unfortunately the museum closed 2 hours early. We will definitely come back to view the rest of the exhibits."
Memorable,Very well laid out museum that commemorates the war and all those who died in it. Goes through the reasons for it and the hopes for the future.
A thought provoking visit,This complex is an outstanding reminder of military conflict that has plagued and continues to plague this part of Asia. The war memorial itself is very moving and the extensive indoor and outdoor displays well worth exploring. As with everywhere in Seoul visitor facilities are outstanding with sufficient English interpretation
A refreshing and candid view of the Korean War.,"Our guide shared war and post-war experiences with Australian soldiers and his visits to Australia. A guided tour is the most efficient way to get an overview of the war. Spend 15-30min downstairs to get a quick overview of 4000+ years of Korean history at your own pace. Free book about the war available at front desk, plenty of ammenities (seem to be everywhere throughout Korea) also friendly and helpful staff. Not too crowded, we were there after lunch on a weekday."
Great memorial and museum - a must visit,"This museum and memorial is a great place. Its free of charge, got a large exhibition and is also very educating. The museum got an indoor section over 3 floors and an outdoor section. The Outdoor section is mostly a few monuments to honor the once who fought the korean war and also a section with lots of full size military vehicles used during the decades of conflict on the korean peninsula. In the outdoor part you get to see planes, tanks and even a boat from the korean war. The indoor exhibition is over 3 floors, each covering different parts of war history of korea. It goes all the war from ancient times with the three kindoms era to koreas involvement with Un relief work. In other words load of history to see and learn. Take note that this place is also a must visit for local schools so dont be surprised if you find yourself surrounded by children on a field trip. But dont fear, korean children are very well mannered and you wont see children running around and making a lot of noise.Visit this place on a cloudy day, dont go there if its rainy if you want to enjoy the outdoor exhibit."
Absolutely great place ,"I visited this place with my 2 boys. We loved it lots of information about Korea War. Also very interesting for kids as they can see the planes, ship and other weapons. The admission is free. "
Great museum that's free,Great museum. Lots of history to read and learn. Free of charge. Easy to get to via subway. Easy to navigate around with English everywhere. Lots to see. Highly recommend if you have a few hours. 
"Peaceful, respectfull and above all an informative memorial to those who suffered helping. ","A tranqiul oasis in the city that is informative and also a memorial to those who suffered and those that helped.The War Memorial is a fitting tribute, In my opinion it strikes the correct balance between being place of rememberance and a museum / park / tourist attraction, it also provdes a history lesson and optimisim for the future.I spent about 3 - 4 hours wandeing about learned much that I did not already know. There were people af all ages, families and many nationalities there at the time of my visit but the place is large and well laid out so although there were many people nothing was crowded.The 'park' is large and there are quite a lot of benches where you can rest in the shade and reflect.This is a place to visit that I would recommend anybody becase we can all learn and also be grateful that many of us never have had to be involved in such conflict.As is the case with many of the attractions the War Memorial is closed on Monday."
Great museum that would be worth paying for!,Huge FREE museum with lots of exhibits and things to see. We spent a few hours exploring the museum during a torrential downpour. This place was better then I expected. Definitely a must see during your time in Seoul!
good place when raining ,this is a very good place go when it rains but anytime is great so many attraction you can enjoy from the past to present great indoor and outdoor exhibits a good place just to chill and watch people it's free
Greatest war museum,It's a fantastic war museum. It exhibits the entire history of the Korean War that showed the materials related to the war!!It takes a few hours for tour so need to comfortable shoes! Must see!!
Memorial to Korean war heroes and patriots,"This is a large complex consisting of seven indoor exhibits including the Memorial Hall (commemorates war heroes and the Korean spirit), War History Room ((depicts some military victories and rocket launchers), Korean War Room I-II (depictnig Korean War of 1950 including a 4D visual experience), Korean War Room III (focusing on role of UN in the Korean War), Expeditionary Forces Room (activities of ROK Armed Forces). There is also a outdoor exhibit in form of the Children's Museum (including a trick art photo zone and guerilla training experience). You can enjoy the Smart Exhibition System service with your phone. The exhibitons are open from 9 am to 6 pm (closed on Mondays), admission is free for permanent exhibits."
memorial,"Some statues near eachother which reminds the Korean good people, died in war for their country. Nice really!"
Fantastic museum,"Really well put together museum with something for everyone, just be mindful there is a fair bit of bias and there is always two sides to every story. Enjoyed the inside and the outside bits - and the kids learnt heaps"
Fantastic (and free),"If you take any interest in the Korean war then this is a must. Very good collection of military vehicles outside and the museum itself is an impressive structure and experience. One of the best museums I have been to in terms of displays and information delivery. The external halls pay homage to the fallen from the various nations. Pro Tip: Even though it says 9am open, come at like 8.15/30 and see all the outside vehicle displays before the museum building opens to maximise your day and avoid the tourist crowds. Expect to spend ~3 hrs."
Total History Immersion ,"Enjoyed this place tremendously. The exhibits were very informative and gave me an idea of what it was like when Korea was at war. Many pictures, videos and relics - all of which provide new experiences of learning. The time you can spend here varies. Personally, I spent 4hrs here because I'm the sort of person who reads and studies every single exhibit, and stop to watch every show and video. But there are some people who breeze and browse through quite quickly, and could possibly finish everything in about an hour. I guess it depends on what interests you.There was a 4D show in one of the exhibits on the 2nd level that illustrated the operations of the Incheon Landing. That was rather impressive, I thought. By 4D, I mean that you will be secured to your seat because the motion chairs move according to whether you're on a boat or a plane. Another thing that was really impressive was how you could use your smartphone to read more about the exhibits - either by NFC or QR scanning. Beside the exhibits, there would be a little panel for you to scan which would automatically open a page on your phone. The page contained information about what you are seeing, and would sometimes lead you to YouTube videos to illustrate it. What a great way to learn!One of the must visit places if you're in to history."
More Peace and Less War,After visiting the Memorial I am like most of the visitors would appreciate PEACE and FREEDOM more than ever. This Memorial is so well done that I get to learn so much about Korean history and not just war. We were very lucky to have a FREE GUIDED tour at 2pm (check information for time) which lasts for 1.5 hours. You do not have to be a historian or weapon fanatic to find this place a great way to spend 4-8 hours there. 
Excellent ,This place is excellent a must visit for history lovers you will learn a lot about history and very beautiful and well funded international Musem. This is one of the best museums I ever visited in my life. The staff are extremely helpful and friendly. I am United Arab Emirates citizen o traveled numerous places this is truly a must visit experienced. I'm shocked that the entrance is free. The quality and information offered is of exceptional quality. You can spend more than 5 hours and not finish. It's that wow. 
Awesome building,"Incredible structure with a fantastic design. Web could not get inside because of a holiday but the yard had a multiple of tanks,planes and boats of both sides"
Super interesting (and it's free!),"This was an amazing experience. My friends and I are going to the DMZ in a couple of days, and we thought it would make sense to catch up on the history regarding the Korean War - and we are not disappointed! This museum has it all, and it's definitely worth a visit - take your time since it's a huge area!"
Good for all,"This was a good intro to our trip to Seoul. There is a large outside area with planes, tanks and boats plus some Memorials. Then a large (free) inside area that you could spend a few hours in. Keep in mind this is not just the Korean War Memorial but the Memorial to ALL war in Korea. Vietnam included."
Worth visit,"A place for memorial war. I visited some place in the word but this place is impressive.The aircraft, tanks, and boats displays outside were very well done. The monuments outside were unique and architecturally innovative. The building itself was beautiful inside. The displays inside were excellent. Well worth your time to visit."
Must see for your first time in Seoul,"For tourists in Seoul, especially those from one of the 20+ countries that participated in the Korean War, this is a must see location. The museum has free entry and several guided tours throughout the day. It's really, really large and even has several outside areas with old planes and ships. Most of the museum focuses on the war in the 1950s, but there is a section that talks about earlier conflicts as well. It is a very moving place to visit, especially if you have a personal connection with the conflict in some way. I think it is good to visit early in your trip since so much of modern Korean society is a response to the Korean War."
Great day out and very beautiful and interesting memorial,"Not only is the memorial amazing in terms of statues and old war vehicles, but it is also in Iteawon which is a very cute neighborhood and has great food options from all over the world. I would recommend going there after lunch, spend the afternoon there and then have dinner down the road towards the metro, tons of little shops if you are keen on that too. "
2000 years of wars encapsulated,"A lot of effort has been put in to this national museum. Entry is free and one probably gains much more understanding than by a visit to 'The Border' with the North. It is in Seoul and easily accessible so no excuse not to visit for anyone with even the slightest interest in why Korea is the way it is today.The outside displays include an array of military hardware large enough to fight a small war, collected from most of the nations which armed the 1950s conflict. All, including a full size B52 bomber, shoehorned together in to a remarkably small area to make a massive 3-D jigsaw. The best view of all this is obtained from the deck of the heavily shell and bullet-pitted gunboat which has found its way in to the ornamental lake in front of the buildings.All the nations, flags and soldiers of the UN forces are commemorated in a huge memorial area.Koreans have a history of war to equal any European nation, and this is outlined inside in an illustrated timeline covering several large rooms. The internal displays include a horrific and moving portrayal of the Japanese occupation.We also saw many groups of South Korean school children, all in their pretty uniforms, being taken around the premises being introduced to the facts of Korean life and geopolitical circumstances. Sad but essential"
A must see,This museum is really nice and you definitely learn about their culture and other things. Is big and when we went there was a woo boat in tbe middle of it inside. They do have the war memorial as well as other exhibits land actual planes and tanks outside. 
Very impressed,"I would compare this to our Smithsonian Museums in Washington D.C. The aircraft, tanks, and boats displays outside were very well done. The monuments outside were unique and architecturally innovative. The building itself was beautiful inside. The displays inside were excellent. I could not believe such a wonderful place offered free admission. Well worth your time to visit."
Worth visiting if you're a military history buff,"Great museum showcasing Korea's military history from ancient times to now. You could easily spend hours reading about all the exhibits. The variety of objects and displays is impressive, and the English translations didn't let them down. We thought the Korean War exhibit with the mock archaeological dig/remains underfoot was especially moving.Only downfall was the cafe & shop. The food is expensive and revolting, and the souvenirs in the shop can be bought elsewhere in touristy shops for half the price. Moral of the story: don't come at lunchtime like we did, there's better food elsewhere!"
Eye opening experience,"While I was in Korea on vacation I went to the war memorial with a supplier representative from a company I do business with. Toured the entire memorial, it covered the entirety of the Korean war from the origins to resolution. As you move through the exhibit you can encounter and speak with volunteers who recount their experiences either in the military or living in Korea at the time. It was truly an inspiring experience to be able to speak with people who actually lived in Korea while the war occurred and hear their stories. The memorial also covered a significant portion of Korean history as a whole it is not just dedicated to the Korean war. You can find a large amount of military hardware on site as well both inside and outside the museum. "
Understanding why we were there,You may wonder why the U.S./UN/NATO troops go into obscure countries until you go to this museum. The atrocities committed against humans anywhere is against us all. This museum is VERY nice and free. Make a point to visit it.
Ony the outdoor part. Was great,"Be aware it is closed on mondays! However it was really intersting to take photos next to a warship, and some air crafts including Really HUGE ones, and see some skud rockets, and weapons from both sides of the war ( both US and USSR made).I liked the concept of remembering all countries contrbutions to the war. The green areas around the outdoor area were great too."
Great Museum for Military History Fans,"I suggest at least a half-day visit here, because you have both a large museum building and a spacious outdoor area full of planes (including a B-52 bomber), tanks, boats, rockets and artillery pieces. You are allowed to walk around and enter many of them, so bring your cameras. The very moving ""Two Brothers"" statue is here, so be sure to look for it and read its story. The museum building is fine for a rainy day, but try to go on a clear day so you can spend a lot of time outside as well."
Excellent Place to Learn Korean History and To Pay Respect to Korean Veterans,Had a chance to visit this place. I was surprised by how big it was. The statue of the soldiers in the front as well as the planes and tanks that surround the building are amazing.
Interesting & educational,"The war memorial museum and surrounding grounds were quite interesting to walk around. It's not too large so you could cover everything in under 3hrs, I think.I viewed and read the historical exhibition on the first floor and it was well laid out and easy to navigate. It was educational, unemotive and child friendly.I found the outdoor sculptures, weapons and war vehicles were the most interesting part of the whole facility.Also, there is a cafe, a canteen and an Italian restaurant on the museum grounds."
One of the best memorials you will ever visit,"I've been here multiple times (I ran out of time the first time. Second was with my dad. Third with a friend visiting Korea for a few days and finally before I left Korea as they have renovated the basement level (Pre Korean War history).Outside you have a lot of amazing sculptures with a meaning behind all of them and also the majority of vehicles that served on both sides during the war (A favourite was the plane a North Korean pilot defected many years after the war)On the left of the entrance (before you go inside) is the memorial of names for the fallen soilders. Very powerful. Inside you have the basement level which is Pre Korean War history and Koreas first interactions with many different nations. Also pointing out important people within history.First and second floor is Korean War from the lead up to post war. A few interaction rooms/ride things. Also a lot of displays and important things within the war. EVERYTHING is in English (And some other languages) so don't worry about that.Towards the end gives the information about Vietnam, Iraq etc.Sometimes they have special exhibition's too!"
War Machines,"We do have a very good time in this museum, especially in outdoor exhibibition.Lot of war machines, such as : tanks, ships, airplane, rocket launcher, etc. My kids like it so much. They try every one of them, and take lot of photos.They also have indoor exhibition, and war memorial museum for childreen also. Indoor exhibition explains more about ancient story of Korean war.They also carve the of soldiers who died in the Korean war.And all of those thing is free. Yes, you read it right. You don't have to pay anything when visit this museum.You can reach this museum by stopping at Samgakji station, exit 1.Instagram : @adjimantoro"
"Great War museum, both outdoor and indoor -",This is probably one of the best war museums I have seen in my life. Great information provided and excellent exhibits! Take your time to visit it !!!
Visit this to understand Korea today,"South Korea is shaped by its geography, in particular the Japanese occupation and Korean war and its aftermath. This museum traces the long history of Korea's kingdoms and invasions with a particular focus on C20. It contains many moving memorials and reminders of the importance of international commitment to peace. "
Well done!,Nicely done memorial and museum. Special recognition and acknowledgement is given to each country that participated in or supported the efforts of the Korean War. Highly recommended. 
The War Memorial of Korea,"It is a peaceful and relaxing place to visit. It is also good to see the tanks, war vehicles and war planes. "
Awesome,"Lots of old war equipment you can look at...tanks, aircraft, etc. Inside are historical artifacts. free to visit. not too much in english. Not too bad but if u don't speak Korean...mostly just looking and the descriptions in English are quite sparse."
Touching and Informative,Great place for history buffs. Lots of aircraft and tanks to see. Amazing statues as well. The two brothers is a must-see when you visit.
Great trip,"It is a great museum, it shows a precise korean history. It starts from the 2000 bc until the Vietnamese war, but the focus is on the korean war. It is great but still has a little lack of english just a little. They givea book for free about the korean war. The best is that there is no entrance fee."
Worth a Visit!,"I love history and going to museum but this is definitely one of the best museums I've ever visited! In a few hours of visit, I learned so much about Korean War more than the textbook in history class in high school. Highly recommended especially for those who is interested about Korean war."
Awesome,Excellent Memorial and Museum. It helps to understand the Korean War deeply. Fantastic materiel in exhibition both outside and indoors
Must see if you are interested in knowing more about the Korean War 1950-1953,"I have visited a couple of war museums in Vietnam, London and Paris and I must say that the Seoul War Museum is outstanding by its design and the interactivity of the expositions."
Huge War Museum,"Probably one of the biggest and best war museums that I have seen. Better than Te Papa in Wellington, for instance. Quite impressive (and free)."
Humbling,"We were a group of about 50 of us (mostly kids) and very limited time, but what an amazing museum. Not everything was in English, but enough was to be able to enjoy the exhibits. "
Interactive and engaging place with a great outdoor exhibit,"We recently spent an afternoon exploring the War Memorial and found it to be a very interesting and engaging place. It is not necessary to take a guided tour, in my opinion: the exhibits are very interactive and easy to understand. There are lots of interesting artifacts to see inside the museum, wartime vehicles and boats to tour outside, and some spectacular bronze statues in the garden around the museum. We learned a lot about the Korean war and its heroes. This is an important place to see when you visit South Korea."
"It is a well organized war memorial, which provides good information on the Korean War","I enjoyed my visit. It has a lot of ""hardware"", such as tanks, planes, and even a patrol boat. But at the same time, the exhibits are very well organized. Some of the stories are also very touching. It's free, and I think it is a must-see for first timer in Seoul. "
Great museum about Korea history,This is a great museum that everyone should take the time to see. It has exhibits for Korean history and also for the Korean War. Very interesting!
Great for the history buffs,"Impressive monument & garden display outside the museum. Inside you will find detailed historical displays of various campaigns along with several planes & military vehicles . Follow along from the outside memorial area, past the museum entry, you will find a huge outdoor display area of service vehicles, tanks, guns, planes including a B52 bomber."
Excellent Museum,This museum is brilliant. The whole exhibition is really well translated into English. There are also free guided tours of the museum a couple of times a day which are worth doing. The museum is massive and takes a few hours to see it properly. There are also many army vehicles including tanks and planes outside which are cool and would be brilliant if you were with kids.
"If you near Seoul, recommend to visit",I went here with my kids and they enjoyed walking aroung and learning more about the history of the war.. they liked most the outside displayed war machines
Find your country flag and its significance,"Beyond all the war planes, tanks, rockets exhibits, & ship, i was just happy to see our flag among those of all nations that sent support to the Korean army during the war. It was a great memory."
Great way to spend an afternoon,Very impressive and well done museum. If you're a history buff and interested in the Korean War this is definitely a do not miss stop. 
A good spot to learn Korean history.,"As with most Americans, we were guilty of only being aware of Korea starting in 1950. This was a great history lesson of a country with a long history of civilization. It was a reminder of the statement, ""Freedom isn't free."""
Worth the revisit,"Haven't been for a year but I had some Turkish visitors keen to visit so off we went. I was struck at first by how interesting it is every time I visit. And, now that I am visiting through the eyes of foreign visitors, I can see how sympathetically it is set up, with equal weight given to each country that fought in this war. The outside display of decommissioned hardware was particularly notable, especially for the only B52 on view outside of the Smithsonian"
Excellent displays,Good historical outline of major wars and battles but especially the Korean War 1950-1953. Excellent selection of hardware outside. English translations available. A good museum for children of all ages.
A must see for anyone visiting or living in Korea.,This museum is dedicated to history of war on the Korean peninsula. It is an invaluable resource to anyone living or visiting the country. It helps to put the Korean psyche into perspective.
Loved it,This was an incredibly moving museum. The museum provided a very comprehensive overview of the Korean War. There are other exhibits providing a nice summary of ancient Korea history. I really enjoyed the exhibit and highly recommend it.
Learned A LOT!,"We planned on spending just a couple of hours here not knowing that this memorial/museum had a lot to offer. We spent most of our day here and hubby wanted to come back another day as we were not able to finish going through the whole building. Wear comfortable walking shoes and eat first before coming here. So much to see and learn and so little time! Most moving exhibit for me was ""The Drop"" by Dong Man Kim."
A awesome place to see and understand the military history of this country ,The Korean war museum was a place of full respect and had all the nation's that help them in the Korean war in 1956. The museum was broken up into several sections including history from the early years leading right up to the current history of the nation. This place has some great areas for kids and even a small shooting range they can go and play and pretend to shoot M16 and some other weapons in a mock shooting gallery. The Expeditions are well designed with plenty of interactive displays. This museum is designed for kids and adults and it has a lot of English translated information and you can get headphones that you can use to walk through out the place getting a full understanding of what you are looking at at. It also had a full Parade with all different types of services the parade was absolutely brilliant and I must say was the highlight of my trip in Korea it went for about 45 mins and after you could go down and speak with these people have a talk to them and even get a few photos if you like. This place was really a great area to go and explore and actually had to do it over 2 days as a was too much to see in one.
Great,"What a great work of art. When standing at the monument and looking at it, it is almost if you can feel how these men felt, while fighting the war."
Meh,"I wasn't educated on RoK history before husband took me here. The admission is free and the display of the museum was informational. However, it can be a little boring after 2 exhibit halls. "
Don't miss this incredible museum - It's world class.,"The War Memorial Museum is one of the best museums I've seen. It's very well put together and is very informative. I would suggest keeping an open mind as there is a fair bit of propaganda as well, but that goes without saying in South Korea. All in all, excellent opportunity more about the war and the history of the South Korean military."
Memory of Korean War,"It shows a typical representation about Korean War which occured in 1950. Furthermore, its narratives consist of two things: Korean nationalism and anti communism. Therefore, there is no sorry for Vietnam War and no talks about peace."
Must See in Seoul!,"The War Memorial in the Yongsan-gu area of Seoul is a must-see while in fabulous South Korea! I recently visited with my son, David to honor my father and my teen-aged Uncle David, who was Killed in Action in the Korean War. The main hall, Memorial Hall has beautiful paintings, reliefs and depicts the terrible hardships of the Korean people during, not only the Korean War, but throughout prior wars and occupations. You will need at least half a day to see the exhibits. The museum houses large weapons, beautiful sculptures and even bronze plaques that list the names of the over 33,000 Americans who were killed in combat/hostile action during the war. The South Korean people are amazingly appreciative of American sacrifice and it was immensely touching to finally see our little David's name on the Wall of Honor. Every Korean person I met there shared their gratitude for Americans like Uncle David, who gave their lives for the freedom of people they never met. God Bless America and the South Korean people-Freedom is Not Free!"
Korean War Memorial,"Awesome place, full of history. RIP to all those heroes who died for their country. I'm from Puerto Rico and was very surprised to see a wall for just for fellow countrymen who died in battle. Very modern facilities, right in the heart of Seoul. Admission is free, perfect of history for anybody interested"
Very well maintained,"Had a brief visit here. It portrays the history of war. It is well maintained. The collection includes tanks, aeroplanes, ships, rockets etc. Children will just love this place. The best part is its free entry"
Great musuem,This museum is really good and really interesting! Outside there is a collection of military vehicles including tanks and planes you can wander around. One of the more worth while musuems in Korea. 
Really big museum,"The first impression that hits you when you arrive at the museum is that it is very very big. In fact it is the largest war memorial museum in the world. It has several mini screenings about the conflicts in Korea which was quite interesting. The memorial covers wars from the kingdom periods to the Korean War. In my opinion it is less graphic as the Vietnam War Remnants Museum in HCM and takes a more subtle approach of honouring those who fought in the war rather than the graphic brutality of the wars themselves. Love the monuments in front of the building. Also the tanks, planes, helicopters and warship...Yes a warship outside the museum. Really worth a visit."
War Memorial of Korea,"Two years ago was my last visit but nothing has changed. This is a must do attraction to get a snap shot of the Korean history. There are displays of each transition of military battles to the current state of Korea. If you are a history buff, maybe a whole day is best to set aside. Great place to let the children run out all their energy. There are the typical souvenir shops and food too.Of course, this is just for snacking. There are many outstanding traditional Korean restaurants around the War Museum. And by Metro, three stops away from the infamous foreigner shopping area Itaewon. "
War,Nice Museum in Korea. The history of korean war between north and south korea. Must place to visit in seoul and free entry
Well done!,"Not quite Smithsonian quality, but a really nice job nonetheless. Sadly most of what I previously knew about the conflict came from watching the TV show M*A*S*H as a child. I learned a lot about how it really went down. Especially liked the patrol boat replica with all of its damage reproduced in detail. Standing in the wheelhouse with all the bullet holes riddling the inside, I could literally feel the terror those sailors must've faced.The B52 was also a highlight for me, though a little sad to see it deteriorating outside like that.Well done!!! Go see it for sure."
Interesting spot,"To understand nowadays Korean life and people this museum is a must see. The nation with many wars in it's history and the perseverance of the people to rebuild the country as it is now, this museum tells us the story of war and how the country is prepared to fight again. There is a guided tour at 10:00 ~ 11:00 am and 14:00 ~ 15:00 pm with the volunteer guides. I took the earlier tour with our guide of the day Mr Sohn Joong Hee on August 18th 2016. After the tour I visited the cafe and shop and bumped into Mr Sohn again and he guided me privately through the Vietnam war section and the outdoor exhibition with vehicles, tanks, field artillery, air craft, armored car, guns from warships, submarines, radar, etc. This really is the place for the whole family, despite the war theme. You can reach the place by subway lines 4 and 6 exit 12. Or buses 149, 150, 151, 152, 500, 501, 502, 504, 506, 507, 605, 750A, 750B, 751, 752, 110B, 730, 421, 600. Get off at the Samgakji bus stop and walk across the street. I took the bus there but the traffic in Soul is rather congested at all times so I suggest the subway."
Nice and intresting.,This place is free admission. A very big place where you can walk around and get information about the country. Also a great place to cool down and for the kids much more exciting then the palace.
Big place to explore,"Overall: - would highly recommend- very informative and you will learn a lot- free!Pros:- this is a huge place, so be prepared to walk both indoors and outdoors- many interactive activities like a free photo booth, and automatic projections/shows that tell stories once you enter the room- wide variety of themesCons:- hard to go to outdoor portion if it's raining hard- building is not very new, although well kept"
Very impressive - especially for History lovers!,It's a very impressive monument to just remember the cost of freedom! The area is in very good shape and walking through it will make you know what it took for Korea to achieve their independence! All the instruments of war also very impressive!
"Large Space, Lots to see",Great museum with lots to see. My favorite part was the outside aircraft expo. The inside is a nice rainy day activity. They often have pop up activities for kids as well (with a fee). Worth a visit if you have an extended stay in Seoul or if you're in the Itaewon area. Definitely go if you have kids!
Incredible,Needs about 3 hours to see wellA worth while objective in depth overview of the warThey even give free books at the entrance regarding the war history. A true gift
Free and informative,"This museum was free and pretty big. There was also an outdoor park with models of tanks, planes, etc. Lots of children running around. It is a good rainy day activity (if you stay inside the museum of course) for travelers on a budget."
Interested in anything military - here is the place!,"Located in between the US Army base in Seoul, this museum has a lot to offer in terms of hardware but also many displays of high quality. Although most of the coverage is geared more towards the modern wars, one can find plenty of artifacts and displays of the Korean battles including the famous the Turtle Ship designed and constructed during Admiral Yi's stewardship. This is definitely not the high quality war museum like Canberra, Australia but definitely worth a visit and you can spend hours inside and outside. Some of the planes and tanks, you can actually touch and climb into. B52 bomber is also displayed in its full majestic self."
Visit to the War Memorial,It is really Hot in Korea now so a visit now is very cool in their Building...Many interesting things of their past history ...Many Items that apply to their growth and things that the past wars helped to create...Take the whole family something for all to see...Have Fun...
Clean city with pleasant people,"Easy to walk around the main city center, hectic on business days. Colorful sights and sounds...wonderful harbor."
impressive,"I was impressed about this memorial. It has a lot of planes and tanks from the WWII from Korean and US. it is located near Samgakji station, very easy to reach with the subway. Good for kids too."
Highly recommend ,Great place to check out if you are interested in history and war in Korea. I was very impressed with the collections. Good place for kids to learn history 
Every time I am in Seoul I always stop here,"I am a history guy, and military history is my drug of choice. it is amazing how this place has changed of the years and it keeps getting better."
Amazing sculpture monuments,A must do in Seoul. It's a museum dedicated to some wars in the Korean past (both ancient and recent). Focus is on the Korean war (1950-1953). Very nicely displayed history facts and lots and lots of war objects actually used in the Korean war. Lots of models of actual aircrafts and ships and a bunch of real ones displayed outside. Super fun! Take a (free) guided tour. The entrance is free as well. The sculptures that welcome you before entering the museum are amazing!!
A must go place to understand Korea,You can see korean history in war perspective. History is all about war and this place is all about the wars in korea fron ancient to modern.Easily accessible by metro and bus.Free admission...Good place to take photos with old war plane and tanks if you are interested. My children were really happy.
Impressive and complete history of wars in Korea,"The memorial is actually a huge museum where the whole history of Korean warfare is displayed. It covers from the Medieval period to present day efforts of the Korean Army. Also there is a lot of attention for the UN and the nations that assisted (South) Korea during the Korean War. The museum is very interesting for all ages, there are a lot of vehicles (Tanks, cars, planes and even boats) displayed, a 3D experience and lots of other different multi-media expositions. I visited this place during a rainy day, unfortunately I wasn't able to see the vehicles in the garden well!"
Wonderful museum,"The Korean war exhibits were very informative and engaging. There are even 4D shows to simulate particular events of the Korean war. I was half-expecting the museum to be all about Korean war, but it also delves into the wars in ancient history, which were very interesting. Best of all, admission is free. Strongly recommend a visit."
Great Korean War(s) Museum,I was very favorably impressed with the careful information and graphics provided in the museum about the Korean War(s). South Korea has gone through much since the 1950s (actually 1910 with Japan) and has recovered as a country with great culture and active development of very world competitive automobiles and technological products.
Wonderful,"This is such a wonderful place to visit for a history buff or anyone that just likes to learn. Both the outdoor and indoor exhibits were excellent. You not only get to learn about the war from the Korean perspective, but you also get to learn about all the other UN forces that fought in Korea. This is a museum that I will visit more than once."
Worth It,"Very good exhibits. The park was well kept. Nice, clean and extremely educational. I highly recommend it to anyone with an interest in history."
Very Nice - Must Do,"We were on a business trip and had a free day so we visited this memorial. It was very nice and is something that should be considered a Must-Do if your are in Seoul/Incheon.We rode the rail system over from Incheon Airport and after one transfer it was about a 5 minutes walk.There are great outdoor exhibits (Airplanes, tanks, artillery, etc.), tributes to all the UN supporting countries and those that served/died in this conflict - it is very nicely done.There is also in very large in-door museum (with good air conditioning for when it gets too hot outside), again very nice with lots of history about the Korean War as well as Korea's history going back 1000's of years.When we were there there lots of people but not really overly crowded - wide range of nationalities and ages. Please visit."
A lot to see!,"The war memorial is amazing. I thought I knew a lot about the Korean war, but quickly realized that I didn't. Anyone could easily kill 3-4 hours in here, if you spend the time through the exhibits. I would say it's quite difficult if you go through here with young children, but don't let that turn you away, as I took my 2 and 4 year old through here in 1-2 hours. Definitely recommend!!"
A Must-See,"The War Memorial should be early in any Seoul visitor's itinerary. The museum, which is free, traces the history of the Korean peninsula in a clear and understandable way. Coverage of the Korean War is, understandably, very thorough, and I learned a ton about the conflict. I would set aside several hours for a visit, as it's definitely not a small museum. As an aside, there's a really good museum restaurant in a separate building on the grounds."
Good place to visit,"I enjoyed the museum, lots of good info about the Korean War and a good variety of equipments on the show, highly recommended "
Really detailed for a free musuem,"Assuming you have some interest in history, this museum highlights many parts of korean history (from 3 kingdoms in the Silla period till the korean war). Exhibitions are very organised as they go according to the timeline and prettily presented too. They have some 4D shortfilms (for free of course) and some are pretty entertaining i.e. the fighter jet 4D experience. In comparison with the national musuem, War memorial offers a wider range in the presentation of history and a more surreal experience too. Most descriptions are available in english."
A picture of Korea history,I would recommend to go for this in a day trip as you will have a much more understanding of the history and culture of the modern Korea. This museum is carefully design and try to give as much information as possible.
Must see attraction.,"If you want to learn about Korean history, this is one the most important things to do in Seoul. If you want to party and hang with friends, then still make time to see this place."
Excellent Museum,"This beautiful, modern museum is absolutely massive. It has everything that you could expect from a museum and much more.It has ancient Korean artifacts, real warships, tanks, weaponry and planes, stunning displays and many interactive exhibits.It does an amazing job of honouring the soldiers from around the world that fought in the Korean war and it explains the history of the war in an excellent manner.On our visit we were lucky to see a demonstration of formal marching and gun handling by a large troupe of soldiers.The museum is opposite the ministry of defence compound which is well fortified and is constantly guarded overhead by an armed helicopter."
One of the places you can easily visit,"Accessible, with tourists even the cold season, it helps you realize the history of Seoul and South Korea."
Very interesting and huge museum (totally free of charge),You can spend a whole day wandering through this massive modern and interesting war museum (from ancient weapons to 4D movies). A must when visiting Seoul.
Must see,I've always had a facination with war history and this museum will not fail to impress! Amazing collection of war apparatus outside that has been fielded by the Korean army over the past 60 years. They even have WW2 tanks and vehicles from both the Soviet and American armies. The exhibits inside are really in depth and do a great job at telling the story of the Korean war. We really enjoyed the museum. Don't miss out on this if you're in Seoul!
An excellent memorial,"This war memorial is a must-see when in Seoul. Allow plenty of time as it is very large. If you're interested in war planes, there are numerous ones there to see. "
Incredibly informative tour,"A free English-speaking tour was provided, and the tour guide spoke amazing English. I learned so much about the Korean war!"
You visit this with DMZ Spy Invasion Tour,"Excellent - lots of great information and great planes and other war paraphernalia. The variety of planes of many types and varieties used in the war was terrific. Also, the exhibits to demonstrate this extremely complicated conflict were excellent."
Must Do,"Great museum/memorial highlighting history of Korean warfare. I thought this was only for the Korean War, but it covers much more. Very nice displays and great examples of various uniforms, weapons, and craft. Did I mention there is no fee- this is completely free!!! We took the metro here and got a little confused where the entrance was, as it was not properly marked with signs on the street. There is a place to get a snack as well. Make sure to take a walk outside and view the aircraft and tanks."
War Memorial Museum Korea,"A place must visit , cannot be missed .Only 15 minutes from Chungmoro station - sangaji station walk about 5 minutes to the location . Big Location with big space with aircraft , tanks , ship and heavy machine guns used during Korean War Also you have 2 floor building with another memorial to be visited . Will take half day to complete the tour -worth a visit and reading all the facts of history "
"Extensive amount of info and displays, and actual tanks and planes!","The most popular attraction here was the tanks and planes available just outside the entrance. It's great for kids and enthusiastic adults, as it lets you climb up on top of a few of them, allow you to take photos in front of them, and marvel at just how huge these things look like close up.There was an overwhelming amount of information inside the memorial itself, so I spent an hour on the Korean War section and that was about all I could stand.Being Australian, it was interesting finding the list of soldiers who lost their lives in the Korean war.Just a tip: don't order any food from the nearby on-site restaurant unless you're desperate for a meal (as I was). I grabbed a beef bibimbap and while it wasn't exactly inedible, it was probably the worst meal I had in 2 weeks spent in Korea."
Impressed,"Honestly I had no clue what to expect from this visit - I only seen pictures. When you walk up to the museum/war memorial you are greeted with the sculpture of Two Brothers. Already their story is an indication of what is to come - strong emotions coming from sculptures, war equipment and finally the museum itself. The sculptures in my eyes capture the different feelings of war perfectly, from there you can walk to the war equipment used during the Korean War. You walk along tanks, airplanes, ships and more - in the end there is also a museum that is more suited for children.The museum itself is an experience. On the bottom floor you have the general history of war in Korea and it adds to the understanding of this culture. Slowly you walk towards the Korean War part and honestly it left a deep impression on me. Two sentences in the museum stayed with me:""The noble sacrifice of heros who dedicated their lives to the country will be remembered forever as a ray of light"""" Freedom is not free.""Highly recommend this place!"
Pay Your Respects to all who Sacrificed- A MUST SEE!,"As a middle aged American, married to a Korean for almost 30 years, but NOT military, I can appreciate both sides. The American military that sacrificed to save South Korea during the Korean War and the struggles of the Koreans during that period in South Korean history.It is sad that the younger generations, from both countries, either don't know or don't care about all the sacrifices during the Korean War, and they need to see this Memorial, so they can appreciate where South Korea was and is today, because of all those would suffered and sacrificed"
quite impressive,"Such a beautifully kept museum. So much has been gathered here and is spread over 3 floors. One could spend a full day in this museum and still not be done checking it out. Outside the main building you may find a children's museum, a field showing off military crafts and tanks as well as a ship. Seriously worth seeing! If you understand or speak Korean, you may also enjoy the interactive films shown every once in a while at various places within the museum."
Surprisingly Good - and free,This Museum/Memorial was a good mix of outdoor (lots of actual planes including a B52) and exhibits indoors that tells of the Korean war. I wasn't sure about going but am glad we did.
Don't miss,"Of all the places I went to in Seoul this is definitely a top 5. Be ready to spend several hours as you go in and out the exhibits and the different history war moments of South Korea. Museum has an app for free guided tours but be aware that as of Aug 2016 there is no free wifi on site. So you should download museum app before heading there. Very strange as there are free wifi hotspot almost everywhere in the city. There are also human guided tours free of charge at least 2 times in the day. Admission is free. Loved the outside exhibits is war planes, tanks, helicopters and ships. "
Insight into Korea,Museum isn't heavy even though about war. Planes and tanks outside are great. Informative even in English and some nice storytelling. It's big and by the end was a little over 'war' but worth a visit. Also free which is a bonus. 
Being A Veteran I appreacate this ploace,I have over 33 Years of living in Korea and see as many places that I can. Everyone if they have a chance should go there.Mr. P
Impressive,"One of the most impressive military displays I have seen, A must see for any historians. Covers everything from P-51's to F-4's to B-52's, Mig's, Heavy Artillery pieces to light. An Excellent afternoon well spent.The exterior is Vast and the interior is impressive all to itself. "
Extremely informative ,"I had very little knowledge of the Korean War and after leaving I felt very informed but also left with a deep sense of gratitude. I'm not a history buff nor have I been interested in learning about wars but the display and organization of the museum was captivating! There are many English translations, various formats of explaining the Korean war, and done in a way that was infused with immense gratitude to the countries and soldiers who sacrificed themselves for freedom and democracy.This museum is FREE and is a perfect rainy day activity and is pleasantly air conditioned.Take some time to look around outside - many models of aircraft and tanks. Not only for the kiddies but for adults as well.Closest subway stop: Samgakji (about a 5 min walk)Staff was super friendly.Enjoy! "
A must-see! ,"As a foreigner living in Korea, I definitely needed to find out more about the history of my new country. This place has amazing artefacts on display, along with a comprehensive story to go with each item on display. The artefact story is written in Hangul, English and Chinese - thus catering for travellers. Furthermore, the museum is very interactive and you can immerse yourself into the Korean War with a 4D presentation of the amphibious landings at Incheon. We spent a little more than 4 hours perusing the museum and were not left disappointed! This is a must-see for anyone visiting Korea! "
Amazingly Well Done Museum,Took our four kids here and spent four hours wandering around. We ran out of time or we would have stayed there all day! Get there early at 9 before Korea wakes up and the crowds begin. Take your time and follow the prompts! The museum was done to give you the full experience of war and it does so REALLY well! The UN Corridor was my kids favorite and the tear drop exhibit brought me to just that. Can't wait to go back and see more!
Fantastic exhibits and a good place to go,"The memorial has some of the most well designed exhibits I have ever seen, and is highly foreign language friendly with audio options in English, Chinese, and Japanese for many voiced exhibits and subtitles for videos. Come here if you would like to find out more about Korea's history in war. Also has an entire field of military hardware on exhibit including planes and boats, a great place to go for the history/military buff."
A must to visit ,Very interesting and well presented memorial.We can easly spend half a day in the memorial. Most interesting place visited so far in Seoul 
More than just. MASH,"I walked in and asked if they had an English speaking guide. 10 minutes later, I was introduced to my own special guide who took me around the museum. I realize that Korea has been at war many times and how many countries were involved with the current War"
A place everyone should not missed!,"I went to the war memorial with my small family.We spent like 4 hours at the memorial.We were fascinated with all the weapons, missiles, planes, tanks, war ship (not sure whether full scale or otherwise) etc as we do not have this kind of memorial in our place.Very interesting place to visit and admission was free and open to public."
외국인 친구와 다녀왔습니다,외국인 친구가 DMZ에 가고 싶어했어했는데 못가서 대신 전쟁기념관에 갔습니다.한국전쟁을 비롯 전쟁에 대해 잘 알 수 있는 좋은시간이엇네요 It's a place that you can learn about korean war and korean military.It costs free and it was much better than what i expected.Me and my friend visited here instead of DMZ.
Do not miss,"I was so surprised I spent as much time here as I did. It's well worth visiting. Outside there are various tanks and aircraft, monuments etc and lovely grounds. Inside is beautifully air conditioned and is an opportunity to reflect on the world and learn more about the war amongst some interesting displays."
The Glory of War,"If you're interested in Korean military history and its glorification, the place will definitely please you. Don't expect to see evidence of the horror that wars can cause. "
Modern!,"Only had time for a brief visit, but the exhibits were very modern and had good English information. The outside has a lot of military vehicles which is pretty cool, and would be especially interesting for children I think. Very impressed"
history,great place minimum 4 hours to see everything I got an opportunityto speak to a professor of history about the war which is better than reading a book.
great museum,"This place has large collection of tanks, planes and other war things. would recommend for kids not so much for couples. a great museum nonetheless."
Great Museum,Large variety of military memorabiliaInformational for kids Great rainy day activity Close to the base Friendly Staff
great attaraction,"large collection of military equipment including tanks,artillery and airplanes.easy to get to from subway. friendly staff"
interesting for kids,This is place that is great for kids and those who feel like kids. I wouldn't recommend this for couples. 
World Class Memorials & Museum,"The memorials surrounding the Korean War Museum are works of art that pay tribute to all of the nations that fought in the Korean War as well as seeking reunification between Koreans on both sides of the peninsula. On the left outside of the museum as you face the museum entrance there are large placards with the names of every Soldier who made the ultimate sacrifice for the United Nations Command. They are organized alphabetically and by country (and state for the US). The displays inside the museum provide an accurate and understandable depiction of why the Korean War occurred and the armistice that is still being followed today. The museum curation is world class. There are also numerous documents available for research. Other wars on the Korean peninsula are also covered but my primary interest was the Korean War. I would plan on at least 1-2 hours. If your a history buff, you could easily spend a day or two. It is a 10 minute walk from the Dragon Hill Lodge and has a subway stop right in front of it.If this review was beneficial, please click the helpful button."
Great variety of airplanes/tanks including a B52 bomber on display,"We went there one of the afternoon and were pleasantly surprised by the extensive display of old tanls/artillery/warplanes from the WWII, through Korean war to relatively more current times. "
surprised,Had time to kill so we decided to stop here. I would suggest everyone stop here. It was very nice. Very surprised
Well presented Museum.,The memorial is rather a complete museum. There are many displays and a lot of history in the place. You need a few hours to look at the display. The memorials are detailed and a great piece of art. Well worth a visit to take in the history of Korea's armed conflicts.
Recent history brought home.,Within my lifetime but before my memories.Very well put together and summarises the various years of the war in a good easy to understand manner
Very modern and interesting,"The museum is huge so be prepared to spend there at least 3 hours. Inside you can see memorials of the Korean war and learn about it not only ny reading but also with different videos, exhibitions and a 10-minute-long 3D movie.Outside is a wide exhibition of airplanes, tanks, ships and a kids area."
Thoroughly enjoyed visiting the War Memorial of Korea,Visited the Memorial with my teenage daughter. We both really enjoyed it. The Memorial gives good insight and understanding of Korea's ancient and modern history in a way which is easy to take on board. The Memorial is free to visit and you can easily spend at least half a day here. We've been here for a week now and we've visited a lot of places but this has been one of my favourites so far. 
Must see if you enjoy history,"This is probably one of the best museums I've ever visited, especially considering there is no entrance fee. Just walking around outside you could spend 1-2 hours looking at all the exhibits: planes, tanks, armament, boats, and memorials. The inside is gorgeous and has multiple floors showcasing not only the Korean War but also early Korean history. There are 2 small restaurants and a gift shop inside as well. Easy access to Yongsan Army Garrison. "
Excellent Exhibition of the Korean War,"Thoroughly enjoyed the war memorial. It showcases the Korean War in a detailed way..entry is free and it will take around 4-5 hours to see the entire memorial at a good pace. It is very well maintained and the collections are amazing with all the war planes, tanks, jeeps etc"
Excellent museum!,"I came here on my last day in Seoul and only had about four hours before I had to catch my plane, and I regret only having that long. I think it was my favorite attraction in Korea. Outside there are probably about 100 airplanes, tanks, anti-aircraft guns, armored personnel carriers, and other large pieces of military equipment. Most are American/South Korean, but there were some captured Soviet and Chinese machines as well. Inside they have a lot of information about the Korean War. What I found most interesting was the section where they had tributes and explanations of all UN nations that sent men or aid to the South Korean side during the war, but there were a lot of other exhibits. If you're interested in this type of thing, I would recommend at least 6 hours for this museum."
"Outdoors and In, something to see","The display of military equipment outdoors is 'worth the detour' itself, as well as the sculptures and inscriptions. Inside, the 4D Incheon landing show should not be missed. "
"Very, very insightful","Goes to show: I went in knowing NOTHING about the Korean War, and left completely fascinated.First of all: Free entry! And when you see the size of this thing, thats not something you see everywhere.The information and detail that they give on this devastating time is immense. So much so that I did start skipping rooms I didn't have the energy for anymore.Moral: Give yourself enough time and save up enough energy and this is a spot in Seoul you do NOT want to miss! "
Wonderful and informative museum. Must do in Seoul,"This is an incredibly informative museum that highlights not only the Korean war, but early Korean military history. The outside of the museum has a memorial and a large number of aircrafts and vehicles. The inside of the museum has 3 floors that are all incredibly informative and talks in detail about the Korean war.As someone who isn't a large fan of museums, I found myself spending 4 hours there without even realising it. This museum is incredibly interesting and a must-do if you are in Seoul."
Glorios,"A lot of army machines, very nice place for children to see the army at it's bestFoarte interesant, armament bine păstrat "
Comprehensive War History & Memorial,"Great exhibits covering past 1000+ years of Korea history with specific attention to military battles. Only had time to quickly look at the North vs South war exhibits. Many exhibits of vehicles, uniforms, weapons, etc. Outside is nice collection of planes, tanks, cannons, etc. along with a few monuments.A must see for anyone who has relatives that served in the war."
Moving,I visited the War memorial of Korea when I went to the Korean War Museum. This monument is a sobering reminder of a country torn in two. Take the time to visit this and the museum.
"Great museum, must visit while in Seoul","This museum was a wonderful stop. The buildings are beautiful and the museum is very well done. There are a number of theater rooms and a good overview of the events. The aircraft collection outside are worth a visit as well, just try to visit when it isn't peak heat time of day!"
So impressed! ,"I have never before visited a landmark where I learned so much history! I highly recommend the museum; anyone can visit: children, older folks, any nationality. Detailed documentation from the UN, pictures, lots of information about the many countries which sent troops, and the many brave men who gave all. I am so impressed with the effort to repel the aggression shown by the North Koreans, the Red Chinese, and The USSR."
Great monuments and collection of weapons,"It should be visited when you are in Seoul. It's a sacred place not only for Koreans, but for many other nations. "
Memorable,"A very memorable and educational visit to the War Memorial of Korea in Seoul. There's a haunting and solemn atmosphere on the day we went. If you wish to have a better understanding of the Korean War, you won't be disappointed. "
Compelling,"The museum is incredibly informative and well laid out. It caters for English speakers and is a fitting tribute to all those who fought as part of the UN coalition. The scale of the US contribution is staggering when you walk around the outside of the building and see all the names of those who died carved into the walls. Also impressive is the hardware parked outside. A real B52, a replica gunboat, tanks, helicopters, artillery etc. Can easily spend a day here."
Great Museum,"This is a well designed museum with a lot of interesting artifacts! Being ignorant I assumed the museum focused on the Korean War, but it is a total history of wars in Korea. I was super impressed with the design and impact of the museum."
Poigniant and fascinating,"I visited in pouring rain which distracted from the outside exhibitions. Otherwise a well laid out and professionally run exhibition on the war, ancient wars and also the UN involvement. A little thin on detail here and there but a great place to visit before going to the DMZ. Loved the limousine of Kim il Sung and the iron-clad warship of the middle ages! And it's free. A little confusing to intially get one's bearings but once sorted it is amazing."
Well worth a visit - free open air.,Easy to get to via metro. Interesting outdoor museum. Good for a couple of hours. Situated in a park area.
Bigger and cooler than I thought it'd be,"The highlights of this free museum for me really were the tanks, planes, and guns outside of the museum, but there is a large museum inside dedicated to Korea wars of the ancient past and the Korean War of the 50's. I also loved the video screens scattered around the museum were you push the ""English"" button and get a brief documentary about a Korean battle from the past (in English). Really helped me to understand some of the museum pieces I was looking at. You could spend an entire day here. Kids will love the war machines outside and the ""4D"" movie/ride experiences inside, but after that may get bored. Still, lots of cool war stuff here. "
Interesting and well-designed museum,"we could have spent many hours but only saw the highlights in 2.5 hours in this large museum with gardens and sculptures. many exhibits from the centuries ago, but best parts were the replica warship and the Korean war exhibits. make sure to spend some time in the gardens and sculpture garden too. "
Grand display of history in a modern setting,What impressed me about this grand facility is not only the massive size but also its modern presentation in a picturesque setting. Indoor displays were interesting as well as the outdoor exhibition of armament & sculptures. An impressive destination worth a visit!
A Sensitive Statement by a Divided Nation,The Memorial tells the story of Korean War that began June 26 1950 and has yet to be resolved although hostilities ceased with the armistice in 1953.However the Memorial is much more. It is also a tribute by a grateful nation to all those countries that provided assistance in their hour of need.
Beautiful Memorial ,This is a beautiful memorial to remember the fallen soldiers of the Korean War. The grounds of this war Memorial are pristine. The monuments are beautiful. If you're able to go on memorial day in Korea 6/25. There is an amazing ceremony. 
An insight into Korea,"The was memorial is both a war memorial and a museum built to commemorate the Korean War. There are a number of monuments including Korean War artwork, statue of brothers, a gallery of all the names of those killed in war a special outdoor memorials to the different nationalities who fought with the South Koreans.Inside the museum there are also some older historical artefacts including the turtle shaped battleship, rocket propelled arrows and other historical pieces. The majority of the museum is about he Korean War with exhibits of the student soldiers, the expeditionary forces , donated relics, artwork based on dead soldiers dogtags, a 4D simulation of the landings at Incheon and the other war 4D a separate female armed forces exhibit and armistice signing agreement amongst the sites to see.Outside there is also an exhibition area with planes, armed vehicles and guns plus a life size replica of a warship which fought in the war. If you want to find out more about he war this is the place to go and twin it with a visit to the DMZ for a deeper understanding of Korean politics."
"Excellent museum, good to pair with DMZ tour","We didn't know what to expect from this place, but it was a really well done museum/memorial that kept our teenage boys interest as well as ours. We went on a DMZ tour in the morning (also highly recommended if you have an interest) and the bus dropped us off (at our request) right in front of the memorial when we got back to Seoul. (Not sure if all DMZ tours offer this).If you have a relative or friend who perished in this conflict there is a kiosk to look them up. The statues were grand and moving and the interior exhibits were really well done and gave a very clear overview of the conflict. We learned so many things that we didn't know. Highly recommended to get an understanding of this war that continues to shape life on the Korean peninsula."
Free,"It was a great day in the rain, we just wondered the place. It was interesting. It is maybe a 1-2 hours visit, if the weather is good there is a lot to see outside too. I recommend to do it if you have time."
Amazing history ,"This place is a must for everyone. The place is amazing, full of history regards the forgotten war the Korean war. If you put it in your schedule allow at least 2 to 3hrs it's huge and you should not rush it. 3 levels of museum, then there is the huge outside area. 1 of the best museums I've been to out of any country. Highly recommended"
Lovely and free,"We just arrived in korea a couple of a days ago and are staying at the dragon hill. This museum is easily accessible through gate 1 or by gate 16 (but a bit further of a walk from 16). We found this museum to be excellent. Lots of areas have ramps so it is easy to have a stroller here. There is also a food court outside the museum and a small cafe with sandwiches inside. The exhibits are everywhere, outside there are tanks, planes, sculptures and memorials. Inside are displays that are relics of the Korean people that document their history. Very educational. We were able to see the description title of most objects in english, a couple of videos as well have buttons that can be clicked for English too. "
"Statues, old weapons","Interesting and outdoors, this is one of the must-see attractions in Seoul. Large scale and a good spot for photographs."
Nice Historical Place,A place to visit if you wish to have some historical view of the independence fighters. Nice place to get some snapshots.
Worth your Time and Attention,"This museum can be done quickly in two hours or all day long. Depends on how much you would like to learn. It is indeed about all of Korea's wars going back through history, not just it's most recent. Everything is titled well in English and I had random Korean veterans pop up and explain things to me about the Korean war. The Memorial room was beautiful and poignant. Also really loved the grounds and statuary. As a side note it currently has an Impressionist exhibit which you are charged for if you want something different."
Very interesting and beautifully designed ,Highly recommend visiting the war memorial. Good exhibitions internally and also outside. Suggest spending a couple of hours there at least
So much to see,"This place is almost overwhelming with content. First, there is the outdoor exhibition, which consists of numerous airplanes, tanks, mobile guns, and personnel carriers. You can't get into any of the aircraft, but you can climb into the personnel carriers, and there is a replica of a sunken patrol boat that you can explore pretty much unhindered. There is a children's museum and play ground. Playground is outdoors and unshaded, but it's something to do. I never went into the Children's museum, but my wife and daughter did. Kids are only allowed in at the top of the hour, there is limited (free) admission, and kids are asked to leave after 50 minutes. Daughter had lots of fun, but didn't get to do everything there was to do. Inside there is a section devoted to Korea's early wars, three rooms devoted to the Korean War, a room about the UN, and a room about the ROK's later military involvement. It was all well done, fascinating, and even interesting for a toddler (without being too traumatizing). Seeing everything is going to take a full day. Highly recommended. "
"Highly educational, free museum. Great way to spend a day!","Well organized museum. Very interesting and large exhibits. You can go at your own pace and take a free tour if you wish. As someone who never learned about this in school in the US, it was fascinating to learn it all from the perspective of South Korea! Afternoon well spent."
Could spend the whole day here,"This is a vast museum covering every aspect of the Korean War. The best way to get through it is with free guided tour at 10am in English which shows you the highlights. There's big tech and low tech displays, 3D theatre, VR display, outdoor ships and planes to explore. The cafe downstairs is basic but there are limited food options. A few subway stops near by depending on which line you are on: light blue track is closest, dark blue further away. Can catch the light blue line to the Korean national museum as your next destination if you have time to spare. "
"Big, loaded with school groups","Lots of exhibits but I guess more things to see instead of things to read, I like learning but with all the kids this was definitely more visual with its pieces then thoughtful. Definitely worth a stop and photos because its campus is incredible. "
Must do in Seoul,"We were greated at the door by an English speaking member of the memorial staff. He was so helpful, explaining what to do first and walking us there. He suggested seeing a short film on the third floor and then working our way around. Great advice! Plan to spend several hours there to fully experience everything. If you are looking for lunch, most of the food is actually outside of the building, to the left of the front entrance. "
A Must See,"This modern museum fully captures the Korean, US and UN contributions to the Korean War. Exhibits are artful and informative. While most exhibits are presented in Hangul, many have English translation. English tour guides are also available. "
Definite yes for travelers on a budget,"Not only does the War Memorial of Korea allow for much learning about Korean history, but it is a great museum for keeping attention. There are activities for children outside as well as all the old planes and tanks to climb on. There are also numerous exhibits that everyone in our group, children and adults, enjoyed like the Turtle Ship and Vietnam war dioramas. Because it's free, it is possible to split into a couple visits if you are visiting many museums to void getting museum weary here, because all of the museum is really worth time to see."
War Memorial,Big museum with extensive historical information on the Korean War. I was surprised that Koreans also like to hold their weddings here.
Great place to know Korea history ,"The war of memorial ok Korea is near to where I'm stay in Seoul, so I go visit here during my last day, my flight day. I'd check official web site of the museum, noted there is free introduction tour at certain time. So on the day, I just go to the information counter and ask for it. The volunteer who bring us around and telling history is a vigorous retired history teacher. She do introduced how war is being start in Korea and how's the latest relationship of south and North Korea. It is quite interesting to know Korea from South Korean aspects.I do enjoy my visit here."
What a place,Travelled the world one of the best places been to. Many historical facts and displays. Great weaponary on show from many wars in particular the Korean one. Very peaceful and humbling.
Memory Tour,Great review all the history btw North and South Korea War. Can imagine the people life is full of pain and hard during the period.
First rate experience,A very well laid out and complete memorial. Could have spent a full day here but didn't have the time. A must see for any visit to Seoul.
A big space with very little in it,"With all respect due to those who gave their lives in the Korean War, this museum is a waste of time. A massive space that just gives propaganda about the victory of 'democracy' over 'communism'. Very little about the lives of non-combattants. If you really want to feel the raw emotional power of what soldiers went through, visit the memorial to the Gloucester regiment in their defence of Hill 235 in Paju, north of Seoul. The only good thing for me in the memorial was the mockup of a turtle ship used by Admiral Yi to defeat the Japanese invasion of Korea in the 16th century. Korea deserves a better memorial than this."
Informative Place ,You shouldn't miss this place. They have already exhibit of actual guns and tanks that you can have photo opportunities. 
Great place,It's a wonderful place to learn about Korean War. Be ready to spent at least half a day. Cafeteria has great food. It's a great way to spent a rainy day n best it's FREE
A good place to start your trip to Seoul,"This museum has a huge outside component with monuments and military machine museum which includes a variety of aircraft, tanks, and missiles. A good place to learn about Koreas troubled past and appreciate how far this country has come. "
Worthwhile inside and out,"With lots of military equipment outside and historical information inside this museum has something for all military enthusiasts. Leave plenty of time to walk around the outside and inside. If you have time, take the English language tour inside and hopefully you will get as well informed guide as I had. I wanted to focus on the Korean War and he really wanted me to understand who the Korean people were and how the war fitted in their view of themselves."
Go!,"We really enjoyed this museum. We went on a rainy day, it had cleared up in the afternoon for us to go out and see the outside planes and ship. There is a lot to see in this museum. It can move you to tears at times. If you enjoy this type of museum, I highly recommend going. And it is FREE. "
Outdoor exhibit area 1 of the best,"Firstly, this place is incredibly big! I went with friends and we spent almost 2hours just on the outdoor exhibit area alone. Displayed in the outdoor exhibition area are all manners of tanks, planes, AA/AT guns, and helicopters. For those interested in war history/machines but not served in military, I feel this is the best place to see some of these up close and personal. The collection included US/Korean/Soviet/Chinese models as well.Inside the museum itself, I found the section on the Korean War really informative and fascinating. Having grown up in a country not involved in the war, it was interesting to get an introduction to some of the issues, key dates & personnel. It sparked my interest to read more about it now that I'm back home.Well worth a visit for the military history buffs"
Awesome,This place is giant. Tons of things to see with many years of war history inside. We got there towards the end of the day so we were a little rushed. The exhibits were way cool.
A Must See Site,This amazing museum gives travelers a great feel for the history of Korea. A history of fighting for their land for centuries. A country that has been taken over many times. It has one of the largest displays of military hardware I have ever seen displayed. Allow 2 to 3 hours to take in the sculptures outside and all the galleries.
Very historic,"A must for history buffs. It is free and easy to access by the Seoul subway. The memorial is for the many folks who died in the Korean War which took place from 1950-1953. South Korea was helped by many countries during the war as part of the United Nations. All the names of folks who died are inscribed on the walls.Also, there are many aircrafts, tanks, and other vehicles used during the war are on display. "
Probably the most underrated place we visited in Seoul,"The memorial and grounds are beautiful, but the museum is really what should not be missed. It's free, the collections are vast, and it provides not only the historical context for the Korean War, but an excellent tutorial on Korean history in general. I'd recommend planning about 2 hours for a visit."
Informative and amazing,"For all history buffs and cultural enthusiasts, this memorial which is free to enter is a great place to spend hours getting lost in their Korea's extensive history. What is more remarkable is their extensive coverage as well as use of eye catching videos, visuals, statues, 4D rides, models, posters, real life relics. Amazing place!"
Surprised ,A lot more here than expected. Very large and beautiful. Great history exhibits. Walkable from Itaewon metro station 
Well worth a visit,"A nicely laid out exhibit, very educational and I had no idea how many nations were involved in the Korean War.Very peaceful and you can walk around at your own pace.A big selection of wartime hardware on display outside, too."
RELIVE THE KOREAN WARS FROM ANTIQUITY TO THE LAST KOREAN WAR,"You get to see paintings and dioramas associated with different wars in the Korean Peninsula. You even get to feel all the action with a 4D Simulation and all of this is for free.If you like boats and planes the museum garden is full of them, besides having tanks and even Mig planes"
A Must-Go - a real look at Korean Psyche,"A must-visit at Seoul, the museum really showcases the warring histories of Korea from the beginning of time till today.A large majority of the displays are dedicated to the Korean War period and even a history buff like myself saw so many things that I never knew existed, including telegrams to Stalin from Kim, or if that doesn't appeal to you, there are multiple 4D shows and modern exhibits including recent conflicts with the North."
Interesting and Sad,"You want to visit this place to better understand the conflict between North and South Korea. There's an AVP in one room where you can watch some old footages. They also have a hallway that displayed names of fallen soldiers from different countries etched in granite stones. It's terrible to see though how many people suffered, but it's a good education. When we were there, the place was packed with students. "
The War Memorial of Korea - the Korean People's Heroic Fight for Freedom,"In a country that has had more than its fair share of warfare and suffering, the War Memorial should be at the top of every tourist's itinerary in South Korea. It takes the viewer back in time to explain how the Goguryeo General Eulji Mundeok's troops had routed a 300,000 strong Sui army in 612 AD. There are interesting early examples of Korean weapons systems that had changed the course of Korean history.The Shin Gi Geon Hwa Cha was a wheeled rocket launcher than could fire 100 rocket-propelled arrows simultaneously.The carnage at the receiving end must have been terrible.The most outstanding Korean-designed weapon system was the famed Turtle Ship, A 1:2.5 scale model of it is on display It was brilliantly well designed by Admiral Yi Sun-sin. It was fully enclosed to protect the crew, while the roof was covered with sharp nails to prevent an enemy boarding party from getting a foothold. The very small sail probably meant that it could not travel very fast. These ships had won Korea many a sea battle against the Japanese.A large number of exhibits naturally cover the Korean War when Communist North Korea had made a surprise attack on the South, and had over-run it in a matter of a few days. The Republic of Korean (RoK) troops, later jointed by the United Nations troops, had fought back heroically to turn the tide. It was General Douglas McArthur's famous Incheon Landing on 15 September 1950 that had turned the tide of war, which later moved for the first time north of the 38th parallel .The war finally ended when an armistice was signed. Among the displays are captured North Korean weapons, including a Russian-made MiG-19 and an An-2 transport aircraft. Numerous poignant photographs of the people's suffering form a wrenching experience.There are numerous exhibits on the Korean armed forces of today. An interesting one is a Korean-designed light, unmanned attack vehicle.Outside the main building,in the open, are a range of aircraft that had been used by South Korea during the war. These include a Cessna T-37 trainer, F-5, F-86 and F-86D fighters, A Curtiss C-46 Commando and C-123 transport aircraft, and - amazingly - even an eight-engined Boeing B-52 bomber. It is quite a sight. It is quite an experience for those -like this writer - who had lived through the Korean War.Hormuz Mama."
Great Display of Honor,This is one of the most impressive memorials I have ever seen. You can feel the great-fullness had by the Korea people for the sacrifices so many have made in the years of conflict. The displays are incredible both inside and outside the building. 
A must visit in Seoul!,Visit this instead of paying huge money for the DMZ tour. You'll learn a lot more about the history and the culture of the korean people plus access is FREE! We hightly recommend it! 
Engaging and educational ,"I found the Memorial very good with lots of history easy to understand and learn. The videos were enjoyable. The war machinery outside was great to be able to touch and climb in and on for some. I may not like seeing any war occur, however it is a reality that they are some evil and greedy people and we need to defend freedom and equality. "
Very educational,"I didn't know much about Korea upon arriving so me and a friend decided to visit the war memorial. If you're on USAG Yongsan, it's within walking distance. Outside the museum, once you walk through the statue listed in the thumbnail for the museum there's an assortment of airplanes, tanks, artillery, ground vehicles, and a replica of PKM-357. Within the ship, you can see a video that outlines what happened to the ship during the Second Battle of Yeonpyeong and see the memorial to the six Sailors that were killed.Inside the museum, once you figure out which time period you want to brush on, head in that direction and prepare to be immersed in a visual history lesson. It took me about an hour to rush through half of the Korean War section. The museum does have exhibits that are put on from time to time that you have to pay to see, but the museum as a whole is free to explore. There's a diverse refreshment stand near the front entrance and lockers for bags and coats you don't want to tote throughout the day (bring a 100 piece for the locker).Unless you come when they open and stay until they close, covering the entire museum is a multi-visit endeavor."
Wonderful museum and admission was FREE!!!,This was a great indoor activity on a cold December day in Seoul. The museum has many wonderful exhibits that movingly portrayed the events and human cost of the Korean War.
"Interactive, Informative, Accessible and Fre",Really enjoyed my morning at the Memorial. There are several floors and exhibits inside and outside of the museum. The facility is quite accessible and is not far from an elevator from the Samgakji station. All exhibits and video presentations are translated or subtitled into several languages and I really felt the appreciation for international support provided to Korea during the war. There are free luggage lockers and a few cafes and you can easily spend 2-4 hours roaming around. 
Blown away by quality and size of the museum and grounds,Very impressed with the quality of the displays and presentations. You can use your cell phone to scan a code at different displays to get translations. Many sections have 4 language options. There is plenty to read and see in English without the cell phone scans.Great use of technology and visual displays. The sculptures and military equipment surrounding the museum are moving and interesting as well.Only had time to go through the Korean War sections but there are many more sections to see. Museum is closed on Mondays but the grounds are always accessible.
A large war museum that helps you understand Korea today,"I wasn't initially planning to go, but when my wife proposed a visit, I thought why not? Visiting this museum was the right decision!This is one of the largest war museums in the world, with displays of ancient Korean weaponry to modern equipment. They even have a B52 bomber outside, and a replica of a salvaged South Korean naval vessel sunk by the North (with damage and bullet holes marked in red). Much of the museum is taken up by very informative displays on the Korean War. It was a real education.There was a '4-D' simulator ride that took visitors back to the bold 1950 Incheon landings, complete with water and air-sprays.Outside there was a memorial hall listing the names of soldiers killed in the Korean War and a static display of military vehicles.And it is all free! Well worth a visit!"
Extensive museum about the korean war,"The museum is easily accessible, its free entry, free tour guides, a lot of history and culture can be learned here, not just about the Korean War but also how the evolution of Korean weapons and vehicles were made, as well as how Korean army would look like in the future. Really cool stuff."
Very informative,It takes three or four hours to finish the exhibition. Very informative and much fun for learning Korean history.
Touching,It was touching to see the tribute of the Korean Government to the Filipino soldiers who died during the war.
Helps you understand the North/South Situation,"South Korea are a very proud nation and extremely proud of their armed forces; national service is still in place. A museum that tells a storey, the past and potentially the future, with thanks and praise to those countries who helped them during the invasion. Very good!"
"Often called the ""forgotten"" war","This is a huge museum and memorial. While the museum focus is on the Korean War with its ongoing issues, it also contains displays and information on the history of the Korean peninsula, its peoples and culture and its interactions with its neighbours. It provides an insight to the anguish the South Koreans suffer by being split into two and their desire for reunification.The museum has an comprehensive explanation on the causes of the Korean War, its progress ( and how close it came to be over-run) and the final outcomes. Add to this the extensive display of military machines, aircraft and ships inside and out. All the display boards are multi-lingual.The memorial wall lists all those that gave their lives from all the participating countries along with country specific markers around the central courtyard listing the sacrifices these countries made to the war.Plan for a long day to explore all that it has to offer including some of the ever popular ""3D"" experiences that are run regularly. It has a number of small cafes for food and drinks. Oh and don't forget - while it is free, it is closed Mondays."
Very humbling experience ,"My wife, son and I were excoriated by our Korean exchange student and his mom. The Korean's are very thankful for the Americans help. I was moved at the respect for America by the Koreans. I hope everyone has a chance to experience this and never forget the sacrifice made. May God continue to bless America and South Korea!! "
Worth a visit,"This is a beautiful, big, well played out museum. It's certainly worth a trip. There's a fantastic collection of vehicles and planes outside, and a ship to go on. Inside, it's interactive, and informative. We wished we'd timed the 3D shows, but we missed them each time and didn't feel like going back for them. As the Korean War is technically not over, the Korean War section helps you understand past and present of Korea."
Fascinating place!,"Lots of history here, going back to ancient times and up to the present. Lots of airplanes, as well as ships and tanks. Gives thorough history of Korean War."
Chronicles the rich history of Korea,"Due to shortage of time, we couldn't visit all of the sections of the museum, but it has a fascinating collection of war history and memorabilia. The outdoor display of warships, tanks and planes was very interesting. "
It definitely deserves to be no.1 attraction in Seoul and Tripadvisor,"If you love history, you can spend a day in the war memorial. The memorial offers an english tour at 10 AM. Our tour guide was really good and explained the whole Korean war really well. The tour is free. "
A great story well told,"A great museum, well laid out and tells the fascinating story of the Korean War. We were lucky enough to be shown around by an English speaking volunteer who spent almost 2 hours with the 2 of us - and it was for free. Recommend this to anyone - just ask about the free guide"
"Amazing and interesting way to know Korea/World war history, good activity for kids","-Interesting and thrilling museum that contains everything you wanted to know and more about the history of war, cold war and it's effects.Is totally suitable for kids, but expect a lot of question that will be though to answer (like why many people had to die??!!)-Kids will have so much fun with the planes, tanks, and all the war gear that is available to jump on and take a picture.-Plan for aprox 3 hrs to spend here.-Place is suitable for strollers-Entrance is free"
Would have been awesome!,Was only lucky enough to see the museum from the outside as I wasn't aware they closed their doors on Monday. Putting it out there so no one misses out like me. Will be my must do's when I come back to Seoul
Awesome museum,"It’s always great to visit museums in other countries because the history of the nation can be viewed through the eyes of the people. Too often, the war memorials in some places such as Vietnam and China, are full of propaganda. Here, the people just want their country to be unified and free from tyranny. There is so much to see and do here. I especially liked the planes and tanks. The signs are bilingual so it is easy to understand the history. It’s still sad to think about the lives that were lost on both sides and it is a great place to reflect upon our own individual freedom!"
Outstanding,"An expansive and very impressive memorial. We spent 5 hours at the war memorial but could have spent more time. There is an extensive outdoor display of aircraft (including a B52), tanks, missiles and a exact replica of a Korean patrol boat.In the time we had we focussed on the outdoor displays together with the 3 halls devoted to the Korean War.A MUST do when visiting Seoul."
Best thing to visit in seoul,Huge and well done explanation of korean war nice to see all the materiel outside. Best thing original documents and communications around the secret agreements before the war
Good for both young and old,"Both my dad and young son loved this place especially the outdoor area where we could go up close to planes, helicopters, tanks, etc. Good photo opportunities and best of all, all free! Exhibits indoors were informative and the 4D experience rather memorable. I was able to really feel the realities of war and the current need to preserve peace going through them. Stroller was available for rent (free) and premises stroller friendly. My dad also managed to collect a free book on the history of Korea and the war, making him a very happy man."
Absolutely amazing,"Been to a number of similar museums throughout the world, but this one is one of the best. The place is enormous, you could spend an entire day here. Free entry. Asked about English guide thinking electronic device and had this young student Amanda take us around free of charge again. Her knowledge and insights were amazing. A must see"
Learned a lot!!!!,If you want to learn about the Korean War then this is the place to go they have all of the planes and tanks ever used in the war on display it's huge I would recommend spending three to six hours it's intense it's very well done and you learn a lot it's very informativeIt's also good for any age little kids who love it too old people so anybody will love coming here
Amazing presentation of Korean War history,"Don't think that this war memorial is just a cenotaph with lists of the war dead. It is far more than that. It is a major museum with extensive displays and video presentations of events leading up to and following this war that ended in 1953. The museum includes a collection of the weapons of war from that period. You will find many displays that recognize the military contributions of many countries that helped prevent the entire Korean peninsula becoming like North Korea. You will also walk away with an appreciation of the amazing achievement that is modern Seoul, a city built from nothing but war since 1953."
Truly Amazing! ,"This is a must do for history buffs. We really enjoyed the planes, tanks, and boats. This is one of those tours that you can do on your own or with a guide. I wasn't thrilled when we stopped here, but I have to admit it didn't disappoint. Each room gave a glimpse to what was happening during the way. An amazing collection of memorabilia. "
A must if visiting Seoul,"Myself and my partner arrived knowing next to nothing about the Korean war and left feeling like experts but without ever being bored or having too much information forced upon us. The grounds the memorial is in are great to walk around, the statues and flags around the entrance are interesting enough themselves for half an hour to an hour. The museum itself is very well done and respectful, it takes visitors through the war from the very beginning to the present day situation - this is done without too much of a feeling of propaganda or bias. We tagged along half way through a free tour in English and the guide was informative and spoke excellent English. The ground floor is a bonus and gives a good overview of Korean history from 0 AD up until the war beginning 1950 (which is then covered on the top 2 floors). Anyone visiting Seoul should make this a priority."
Historical learning experience,I recommend the War Memorial of Korea as a must-see on anyone's list of things to do. The Memorial offers such an intense learning experience.
Good museum; Avoid volunteer tours,"The museums is very good and you can spend a few hours here. We took a volunteer student tour, which was very very poor. We actually had to read everything ourselves. The museum otherwise is impressive"
Good for knowledge,"Spent about 3.5 hours here. Very good for a history lesson. There are indoors and outdoors. On the outdoors, you can see tanks and planes that were used in the warOn the indoors there are 3 levels here so take your time to walk around. There are information on every display. Take your time to read or take a picture. Some rooms have a short 3-D movie about 5 mins. Its really exciting. Please be quiet here (especially if you are indoors) and if you have children because this is not allowed for kids running around or talking loudly"
One of the best museums I have ever visited.,"As an American sometimes i get caught up in thinking that the world revolves around us. This museum was a great reminder that Korea was a country with a military history long before the Korean war in 1950. However, the section of the museum dedicated to that portion of history represents itself very well. "
A Place In History,It is an interesting and informative institution to visit. A place full of Korean modern history. It show case the pain and suffering of the Korean people. One just wonders how mankind could destroy each other just over different ideology and influence. Friends and families were permanently separated. War is not an alternative to peace. 
inspiring reflections,"An interesting juxtaposition of ancient military technology with the modern one, including B-52 bomber. An eye-opening historical account of the Korean War and the international support and participation. Need 3-4 hours to visit. "
excellent and extensive,"This museum will keep you very busy. Key battles are explained with short videos and plenty of information. Several pieces of military equipment, including tanks and planes are here. I can't think of anything more you could ask for in a military museum. Even non-military or history buffs will find it fascinating. The most extensive part is the Korean War section but my favorite area was the area covering the wars between the 3 kingdoms and Koreans defense against the Japanese in the 16th century. Plan 2 hours for non-history lovers, military and history lovers will need 4 or more hours."
Interesting look into the history of Korean warfare,"Korea's museums generally aren't the best, but this war museum at Samgakji breaks the mold. As well as a fascinating insight into the Korean War, there are exhibits showing a replica of Yi Sun-shin's turtle boat, and when I went there, they had the remnants of the North Korean missile that sunk the Cheonan. If you're only in Seoul for a few days, this should definitely be on the 'must-do' list."
War Memorial ,Very touching and emotional one if you lost a loved one during the Korean War...we did rubbings of our loved ones names on the bronze Wall of Remberance on mulberry paper. Museum was very historical. Great visit!
The best war museum in the world! ,"I love the history between North and South Korea and looked very much forward to the visit. Had 3 hours spared just for this museum and turned out I was there fore 4 hours. It is that amazing in my opinion! So many different exhibits explaining the build up from the Japanese invasion to the regain as Korea, to Kim il sung's invasion and the support from the UN, down to how the DMZ was formed and for the thoughts of reunification. Learnt so much from this visit!"
Worth to visit with kids ,"I've been there several times with my family. Good interesting and peaceful place :). Have different kinds of military transport like ship, airplanes and tanks displayed outside in the park near museum. Your kids gonna love it 'cuz they can touch and try everything. They hold the traditional wedding ceremony sometimes it was interesting to look at for us one day. And the museum inside is good as well. Not the best one I think but worth to visit. In the same building you can find different expositions not related to war. "
Awesome museum,Loved this museum as there was so much to see and learn. Kids (ages 11 and 9) came away with alot of new knowledge. Took 4 hours to go through it all. Highly recommend for age - awesome place. 
The War Museum and festival,"I visited during May and there was a festival going on....families, kids, picnics. Such a sight to see! The museum and memorial was comprehensive, very informative and quite moving. Go!"
The place to be for everyone wanting to know more on the history of the Korean war,"If you are interested in military stuff you can easily allocate 1 whole day for this site.So much to see and so much to read!Be sure not to miss the 4D movie theaters on level 3 (1 show per hour)Best of all, its free! :)"
Understanding Korean Culture,"A visit to The War Memorial of Korea helps give insight to the Korean Culture of today. After all, the War happened in a not so distant past. There are guided tours in English at 2:00pm and some time in the morning, as well."
Fitting to visit during (USA) Memorial Day Weekend,Great museum. Huge place. Free!Impressive museum albeit a sad 'event.'It was warm inside although comfortable temps outside.
surprisingly interesting,"Lots to see outdoors and indoors, we were not planning to go but our tour bus was letting some people out at the end of the day so we jumped out. One of the few free attraction and we were not disappointed. "
A very interesting place to visit,Spent almost 3 hours walking around and found it very interesting and informative. Would highly recommend
Really moving and learning experience,"Since my father was in the Korean War, it was a must see for me. It is great to know that so many countries came to the aid of a country and people that they had never met. This has the history of south Korea through various wars, and also many monuments to honor the soldiers who died, from the US and other allies to protect them."
Poignant,Interesting museum with some great exhibits outside including a B52 bomber. Well laid out inside telling the whole history of Koreas past and not just the 1950/53 war. The tear drop made from dog tags was especially thought provoking.
A military mustsee,"If you are into Military History then you will enjoy this site. I had 2.5 hours there and it wasn't nearly enough. Well laid out with a really nice outdoor exhibit featuring a lot of ""hardware"" I found it very fascinating. Myonly disappointment was there wasn't a lot of information on our Australian involvement that I could see; but I may have missed it on one of the numerous audio visual . Theere are English Speaking Guides if required but I just wandered around and still enjoyed it."
Absolutely amazing place,"A very moving experience. It was fabulous would recommend anyone any age to visit. So much history. The displays are brilliantly done and the voice-overs make the displays better including the aircraft,military vehicle etc.Well worth a visit."
History history history,Enjoyed this museum tremendously. This is so informative and loved that mostly all provided English information. There are 3 D films and so many items to see. Family friendly and FREE!! 
Great Visit,"Right up there with the Imperial War Museum London and the Australian War Memorial, Canberra. Many exhibits of the surprising violent Korean past (outside of the 1950 war). Lots of exhibits, with strong focus on the north/south divide. It takes a good couple of hours to see the place in full including the array of aircraft and armored vehicles outside including a B52!"
Not just one war,"This is a museum about all Korean wars since before history. And this country has gone from one war to another. It is an imponent place from the outside and big enough inside to accomodate ancient ships, helicopters, anti-aereal defense, tanks and others. But what I liked the most was a great panel that shows parallel historical landmarks happening at western and eastern worlds. "
Beautiful and Meaningful,"Originally, I went along to see the War Memorial of Korea because my husband wanted to go. I was pleasantly surprised at how lovely the museum was. The entire museum is based on the single phrase that ""Freedom is not free"". Not only is the historical portrayal well done, back into the early Korean dynasties, but the Korean War section itself shows not only the military history, but also the impact of the many countries that helped South Korea win was, and how thankful the Koreans are for the assistance. The art was high quality, and evoked a deep and thoughtful emotional response that surprised me! My son-in-law is an officer in the US Marines, and my father fought in the Korean War, and I found the exhibit a pleasant complement to the exhibit at the Marine Corps Museum in Quantico, VA."
Truly amazing.... You could spend so much time here,"Truly an amazing experience. This country has so much war history, to even have the chance to learn a small bit about it while I was here was unbelievably fascinating. You couldn't visit South Korea and not make a trip here. Well worth it!!"
If you like history its a must visit,"I was exploring the outside with all the airplanes, rockers and armored vehicles. Took lots of photos. I run out of time inside so next time i will visit again. Its sad to see how many people died because of this nonsense war."
Incredible site ,"We went to the Korean War memorial, it is very nice. The site has many static display's of aircraft and tanks from the Korean War. The monuments are inspiring and very thoughtful. It is a short walk from Iaetwon."
"Very Interesting, Humungous, Museum","Spent the morning going through the museum among Korean kids on a field trip who were delighted to practice their English on us with many ""Hellos"" and giggles. This museum covers wars in Korea from the very beginning with many interesting exhibits. Me, my sister and nephew were mostly interested in the Korean War as our father (grandfather) served in that war. We were glad we visited and this is a museum not to be missed if you are in Seoul for any length of time."
Good Museum,"i love this museum. i could find all information about war memorial between south and north korea. the place are big, from inside and outside are awesome place, i could find movie 3D about war memorial of korea "
Top in Korea for history and culture. ,"I have traveled throughout Korea and this is my favorite place. It's magnificent and solemn. The lessons I learned about the struggles of the Korean people for freedom and the Alliances and sacrifices that earned their freedom opened my perspective not only about the Korean War, but the world. I fell in love with the Korean People. I highly recommend this visit as one of your first experiences in Korea. Especially if you are unfamiliar with the Korean War or you think you are. It is impossible to see the entire museum in one day, so we picked a section indoors and out and plan on returning with family and friends. Noksapyeong station exit 2 or samgachi exit 1/2. It's a quick cab ride from itaewon or Yongsan stations. "
Excellent museum ,We had 2 hours to spend and ran out of time. This is an interactive and huge museum with lots of nice + real objects!!Truly the best in Seoul and free of charge even!We certainly plan to go back. 
Awesome very important memorial. Must see!,"Spent a couple hours here and never even made it inside. Great exhibits with statues, aircraft, vehicles, tanks, missiles...even a Korean Navy ship! Can't wait to go back to fully explore this place. #1 stop in Seoul for a reason folks."
Really great historical review,"This museum is very well done and very interesting for a subject that's mostly about dates and events and historical figures. My favorite part was the timeline that compares Eastern history, Western history and Korean history during the same time periods back to paleolithic period. The Korean war section is very moving and is full of memorabilia from the UN countries who helped during the war."
Great selection of military machines!,"We chose to go to the museum on a Monday !... Don't it's CLOSED!!... But you can walk around the grounds and see the war memorials of all the countries who have served during all the battles over the decades. Great presentation of air- land and aquatic machines used during the War... Great photo opportunities to get a picture of you in a tank or playing ""Top Gun"" with the various helecopters on display.. Disappointed the museum was closed but wasn't a wasted visit ... Very touching and humbling experience .."
Spend an hour spend a day,"This war manorial offers a great guide into the dark history of Korea.Showing the times of fear and joy during the Korean war, the Japanese invasion and dating all the way back to the Joeson period too.Free admission buy I usually give a donation.There are free tour guides and almost all of the objects and exhibits are in English too.Depending on how much of a history or military buff you are, this may be a 1hr visit our a whole day trip. There is also a reasonable priced cafe to take a rest and lockers to store your bags for those who have travel or shopping bags. "
Essential part of any Seoul itinerary,"Came here after visiting the National Museum (it's one stop away), and I enjoyed this museum more. Not a fan of military history, but the details of the horrors of war and the memorials make this a memorable and sobering visit. I was there for 1.5 hours so I didn't have time to dawdle around the various individual exhibits/military vehicles outside the museum, but I did go for the 4D experience room. I would recommend a longer stay. The effects are not the best, but it is chilling to watch the clip because it really does try and place you in the midst of the war and imagine the various struggles the civilians and soldiers had to go through. The surroundings of the museum is really beautiful in the late afternoon light during spring, and the flowers are gorgeous.An essential part of any Seoul itinerary, because it is necessary to remember that beneath the glitz and glamour of modern day South Korea, such a war happened and is still happening."
Spending half day for one museum,"I love visiting museums and South Korea established many interesting ones. As a university student, I learned so much from here. Exhibition is well arranged with clear English translation and directions. Situated not that far from subway, it is walking distance. I would recommend this museum to other friends."
Definitely worth a visit,When rain descended on Seoul we decided to visit this museum and it was incredible. The museum is free although donations are appreciated. A lot of the museum is dedicated to the war in the 50's and this is clearly set out with lots of information and many interactive exhibits. It's truly humbling. The upper floor is almost solely dedicated to outlining the support relieved from their allies and everyone country is thanked in detail showing how their individual support helped the effort. The memorials outside are equally thought provoking and stunning. If you visit Seoul this is a must see to help you understand the incredibly history of Korea which affects them to this day.
Interesting,A good museum with many good displays. Unfortunately the changing of the guard did not take place when we thought it would.
"Interesting museum, but try to go on a guided tour ","I visited this museum on my own. It's large and has extensive exhibits about various wars that Korea has been involved in over thousands of years. The largest component is the exhibits about the Korean War in the 1950s. As I walked through the exhibits on my own, I felt overwhelmed by the quantity of information and was having a hard time taking it all in. I caught up with and joined an English-language tour guide and found that to be a better experience. The guide was very good; he was knowledgeable, his English was excellent, and he picked out highlights from the exhibits to show and explain to us. I certainly learned a lot about Korean history from him and from my visit to the museum--I recommend visiting and joining a guided tour!"
Humbling Experience,"I wish I had more time to spend at this War Memorial. I have always looked up to those men and women who have served our country. Great information and fun war equipment (artillery, vehicles, aircraft, etc.) to see."
AMAZING!!,"This is a fascinating look at the history of War in Korea. Only knowing about the history of US War, I was not prepared for how long a society can be at war and still survive. The Korean people are resilient! There are other exhibits there that we didn't have time to get to. Outside on the grounds is quite extraordinary as well. "
Memorial museum ,"Worth to see it, pretty big museum and a lot of trucks and pieces to see outside. It's easy to go there with the subway from Seoul station for example. They have guided tours or you can explore it for yourself. "
Awesome,"Huge place....more like a complex than museum. Excellent presentation of Korean War info, and really good info on early Korean war history. Lots of English provided. Outdoor museum as well. Spent 5 hours inside and outside and still didnt see it all. Free. English speaking guides provided for free periodically too. Fantastic."
Impressive - A Must See,I've been to the War Memorial on two separate trips to Seoul. It's British Museum - Smithsonian caliber and impressive by any account. Very well done and an incredible look at Korea's tumultuous past. A real testament to a determined and proud people and how far the country has come. 
Fascinating!!,"I am always interested in war memorial because it is an amazing thing to learn the history and constantly reminding us the importance of peace. My favourite exhibition hall was Hall 3, the United Nations. All the tanks, aircrafts and warships would fascinate you and I reckon kids would like to see those big planes. It is a great place to visit and spend the day and actually learn something."
Superb!,You can learn so many things about korea and its history here. Free entry. Need to spend at least one morning to complete. 
It's Not All about the Korean War,Did you know that Ethiopia sent troops to Korea during the war? Nope.....neither did I. And do you know how the war started and finished? No? Well I'm not telling so you will need to visit to find out. It's not all about the Korean War though and there is a lot of ancient history around conflict to view as well. Entry is free. Exhibits are well presented and there are a few surprises (like Ethiopia). A must do on your visit to Seoul and a great way to spend a rainy day as well.
Korean History,Best War museum of the world........from the begiining of the Korean History to modern times. The outsiden exhibition of war-machines is of high quality.
Inspiring.,A wonderful tribute to the people of Korea and the UN who assisted in protecting the people of the South from the invading. Makes you feel lucky to have not lived in such a treacherous time and environment. 
Museums ,"I visited a lot of Museums and this is one of my favorites. you can see the actual tank, aircrafts used during the war. All types of guns, grenade. it's better to have a Korean friend with you because they don't offer English Tour guide and almost all writings in the display was in Korean. so I just walked around. You will see how Korea was totally wreck during the war and you will appreciate how progressive the country now. it's near itaewon you can just walk going to itaewon. "
Korean War memorial and museum,"This is a top military museum and memorial in one. Kind of like if the National World War 2 museum in New Orleans was next to the National WW2 Memorial in Washington, DC.Great exhibits and an outdoor park with planes,, tanks, etc in a truly great collection. The building itself is amassive, impressive structure on par with one of the Smithsonian buildings."
Huge range if giant boy toys.,This and the dmz tour would be my highlights of seoul. Every tank and aircraft used in the korean conflict are parked at the front if the museum and the information inside is amazing with free guided english speaking tours also. 
"High Quality, High Information Museum","I have long had a basic understanding of the Korean War. This free museum gives a very thorough trip through the war. The museum is very well done. Most signs include English translations. The exhibits are high quality and well organized. I learned a great deal. (The museum also covers Korean military history beyond the Korean War, although the focus is on 1950-53.)The museum also includes artwork honoring the sacrifices of the soldiers and people in both the North and South. It also reflects a yearning for eventual unification. It's moving to see groups of school kids learn their country's culture and history."
Our ES/MS boys spent three hours there and didn't want to go!,"It's a great museum for all ages. You can ask at the desk for a bilingual guide. The museum covers Korean history from 1000 AD to the Korean War and has lots of planes and tanks for kids to touch and go inside! A sunny day is best, but still lots inside to see as well."
A big surprise on the positive side,"I had read some reviews, but still did not know what to expect. It was so much more than I expected. I did not know much of the History behind the Korean was, but this was really interesting. They had so many different ways of showing it, from videos to big screen cinema and a lot of weapons and stuff from the war. It was all made exciting and a lot of museums around the world, could learn from this place. Well done. The museum is also bigger than I thought. The section outside with tanks and planes was fun as well, that part is sure to be a hit with children. And the whole thing is FREE. I would not mind paying some money to see it, but that was a nice touch. Outside they have a memorial stone for the different countries that helped during the war. Nice touch ."
"Fascinating, Large Scale Memorial",This memorial is huge compared to anything in the USA for war memorials. Has great information and visuals/videos about the Korean War starting with end of WWII through the war in the '50's
One of place i must visited.,My grandfather is a Korean war memorial. I want to visited this place . It was big and very historical.
The Two Brothers Statue is the perfect opener for this superb intro to Korean warring history,"Keep two hours at the very least( I spent a full day here) if you want a real sense of Korea's own history, South Korean version. Seoul is full of museums which also have entry fee, but this superb one is free. Has guided tours, big sized lockers for you to keep your rucksack and an ongoing parade at 2 pm ( check online before reaching at that time) and many cafes in all directions within the campus, should you get museumitis and want to just take a break. From the quivers to the bomb caskets to the UN interventions, Indians will find the Indian Flag flying outside, in a wonderful surprise and true spirit of gratitude and formality on Korean behalf."
Interesting place,"A very good and informative place. Have to visit it with kids, can climb some airplanes to see what's inside. For adults will be interesting too. A lot of different countries' equipment.Free to visit."
"Best part, not just the Korean War",The name of the museum can be confusing since this place hols much more than just information on the Korean War. Spend the day here travelling through the world of Korean history
Amazing ,I recommend everyone take the time come here and see this. It so moving. It puts into perspective what we may not have been alive to understand
With DPRK not too far away and rattling the cage a country like Korea needs a museum like that,"For us Europeans it is a bit too much and too extensive the description of the Korean War. Remarkably, lots of korean-style new media is applied to keep young generation interested (4D room with real snow, e.g.) as the current youngsters might feel much different towards the North (why should we care, is the question). So conclude w/o DPRK story told would sound different. Its a great museum and tells of a nation that underwent a horrible time post WW2, and the combined effort of UN Forces to keep the freedom and not let it go the sowjet-style way..."
Fantastic Museum,This is probably one of the best museums ive been too. So many interactive models and so much to see. Very interesting to way to find out about the Korean War
Great museum ,Great museum and if you go in a weekend they provide free English tours by students. I went on a raining Saturday so the museum was not very crowded so I ended up with my own personal tour guide and he was very friendly.
not that special,"Nothing really special about it, I have seen more impressive Korean war memorials in several locations in US."
"Very large, easy with kids","We visited as a family of 3 with a 2 year old in a stroller.I was very impressed with the size and quality of this museum. There were three floors of detailed exhibits, detailing Korea's involvement in international conflicts. Highlights:Outside they have many life-size airplane, tank, and ship models.There is an outdoor play facility for children, as well as a children's museum of sorts.The whole facility is easily accessible for those using a pushchair/stroller, including lifts and ramps.Exhibits:They are mostly in both English and Korean. Most of the signage around the facility is as well. Most are very detailed and well thought out. Very informative without going overboard.The exhibits are mostly not opinionated - they just state facts: dates, locations of conflicts, number of trips involved, etc.I would definitely recommend visiting. We were here almost a whole day and didn't see everything. We had a really nice time though!"
Very interesting Museum .,"Is similar to other Memorial , but inside you feel immediately the sensation of how much is till actual the idea and the presence of the war in Korea . Very wide collection of aircraft . Not loose if you visit Seoul . "
Poignant memorial,"The Korean War memorial is definitely worth a visit when in Seoul, and preferably before the visit to the DMZ.There are many multi-media displays, including a 4D theater (with limited seating) which puts the audience in a first person point of view to experience Operation Chromite, the audacious amphibious landing attempted by General Douglas McArthur, which turned the tide of the Korean War.It also clearly spell out the cause of war and the evils the far eastern communist bloc which shattered dreams of Korean unity.A 5-star attraction that helps one appreciate the fragility of the freedom we enjoy, and the price paid by those who gave the ultimate sacrifice."
Make the Time to Visit (just not on Mondays),"This was a beautiful place that shows so much of the history of Korea. There are exhibits about more than just the 20th century, which I found especially informative. The outside has equipment from the war efforts (planes, tanks, etc.) which give you a feel for what soldiers went through and fought with. Plan to spend 2-4 hours depending on your level of interest and prior knowledge."
Huge museum!,My family enjoyed going here. It is huge and all free! Lots of military memorabilia to see. Loved seeing the B52 up close!
Best Museum ,"I'm not a HUGE museum person, but I fell in love with this place. It's built for people with short attention spans who still want to see a lot of history. A must stop in Seoul. "
Half day museum ,Great visit for a half day activity. The outdoor area has several static displays and the inside museum area provides a thorough history of the Korean War. Really wonderful for veterans and history enthusiasts. 
Moving and very well done.,"This museum is an incredibly well put together history of military engagement in Korea, with an emphasis on the Korean War. It manages to set a tone that is somber but hopeful, grateful to Korea's allies yet proudly strong and independent. I have made a point of visiting this museum on every trip to Korea and will likely visit again. While this museum is a great rainy day activity, it's worth stopping by during nice weather to roam around the outdoor park with static displays of various military equipment."
Rainy afternoon activity,"War memorial of Korea is a very well laid out museum of the Korean war. It caters for both Korean and English speakers. The museum had multiple levels and very clean facilities, It can be done in a short time or if you wish to see as much as possible a few hours could be spent here as well. "
Short Visit,"Called in here as part of another tour, so spent about an hour here. I am sad to admit, I had very little knowledge of the Korean War, so spent a while getting myself up to speed. Fantastic displays, the information is well presented, and very easy to get your head around Well worth it"
Interesting to learn about the Korean War,"we did not know a lot about the war, took the English tour and it was very informative and well organised. I also really enjoyed the outdoor exhibits. "
My Dad and My Daughter in Law's Grandfather were on opposite sides,"If you want to understand the Korean War, this is the place to go. My Korean Friend took us here and it was a highlight of our visit. My dad served in Korea. My daughter in law's grandfather was a General under Chairman Mao. It's a small world. "
Good history,Inside and outside impressive monument and Museum. Very pretty. Great information and displays. It is a memorial to all koreans that died and the UN forces. Reminder that Colombia was the only Latin American Country to send help; and why Truman was right.
One of best museums ever.,"This musuem is a real gem. It is very insightful, and has some powerful and moving testimony of what happened during various invasions of the country and of course the war with the north. There are 2 movie theatres with 4D experience, they have a minimum requirement of people to run and limite seats, We went during lunch when they were shut. the museum is free. There is a leaflet guiding you to the different floors and rooms in order of history. the outside is also amazing to see but best to leave enough time for inside which is easily a 2 hour effort. "
It was ok,Not the best thing to see in seoul in my opinion...if you wanted to know more about the war...this is place to be...full of tanks ships and planes used in the war....the statue is nicely done...
Fantastic Museum,"We were led by a wine-loving, multi-linguistic, enthusiastic Veteran named Kim. Our tour was for an hour. I wish I could have stayed longer. The exhibits are fantastic, emotive, informative. Kim was able to give us explanations about specific military tactics as well which was great. I unfortunately got there a bit late so wasn't able to stay as long as I wanted.At 4pm there was a military performance which was pretty much the coolest thing i've ever seen. They only run them in certain months though (April being one of them)"
Worth the time,Worth the visit. It's free and very well maintained museum. The outdoor exhibitions of tanks and planes actually made our stay enjoyable. 
A Sobering Reminder of the Cost of War,"I had no preconceived notions of what to expect prior to my arrival. It was a rainy April day, and I just wanted to spend some time better understanding the history of US involvement in the Korean War. From the moment I hit the outdoor grounds, I was in awe of how elegantly and profoundly the Koreans have chosen to reflect on their Great War. The statues, sculptures, and monuments are breathtaking.Inside, I found a rich history and story behind the war and later efforts at unification. I highly recommend taking two hours (at a minimum) if your time in Seoul to experience, and to truly understand the origins of some of the more contemporary crises on the Korean Peninsula."
Profoundly moving and highly informative,Extremely well laid out and presented and with all English sub titles. The hands on experience outside with a vast array of military vehicles and planes was really great.
"Wow, fantasic","This is a great museum, lots of information on the Korean war, plenty of information in English, interesting exhibits and videos. The real highlight was the amazing array of War hardware, Tanks, Jeeps, Helicopters, Jet fighters, Anti air craft guns, canons and even a life size replica of a Navy Patrol boat PKM 357 (that the North sank during a conflict in 2002) that you can climb all over. The kids will love it! And it's all free. Caught the metro from Seoul Station and then a short walk. Afterwards walked all the way back to Seoul Station, It's an easy walk, passing lots of interesting restaurants."
"A bit sombre, but a great insight to the many injustices and wars that the S Koreans have had to endure","For an outsider, it's a bit of an eye opener. The history of Korea is quite shocking, and for such a small nation, they have had to endure perpetual persecution and wars. If you are a history buff, it's a must see."
Very interesting,"I am gonna be very short on that review but this place is a MUST see i repeat i MUST see , if you have at leat even a little interest in history you have to go there.I skiped a fews parts from the middle age and still took me almost all day , so do not plan any other big thing the day you go there.The tour is a must, the tour only concern the part of the musseum that is about the north and south Korea war, so reserve this part for the tour and do the rest of the musseum on your own.There you can try to really understand what happened during that war and also have a change to look at the big picture.A MUST SEE"
Well worth the time!,"Our intent was to visit the National Museum but got off at the wrong stop and so happy that we did. This place is so well organized. Incorporates the history and experiences so well. You can feel the pride, hope and gratitude of the Korean people here. The outdoor exhibits with lots of tanks, planes and other war vessels are a must see. Well worth the accidental stop!"
How war memorials should be done,"I've seen several memorials commemorating only a particular person/persons or just the country on which it was built. The War Memorial of (South) Korea though, gives praise and gratitude to the nations that assisted in that bloody war.Flags of more than 10 nations including the Philippines are erected lining up the center. So tourists from other nations can have a taste of pride taking pictures of themselves beside their flagpoles.The memorial also exhibits more than a dozen of war machine artillery (planes, jets, ships, tanks, and my personal favorite, an apache helicopter), which is the most I have seen.And the best thing is, the place, monuments and exhbits are well maintained and kept clean."
Weeping Cherry blossom,"I went only because of the cherry blossom. But the way they respect their brave, it's a honourable site. It is next to a subway station and easily accessible. "
A must do in Seoul,"Site includes an extensive museum with very interesting and informative exhibits as well as a large outdoor collection of military hardware, including tanks, boats and planes. Memorial covers numerous statues and grounds. Can easily spend a few hours there. We walked there from city centre but it would be worth getting the subway."
Beautiful open air museum,"I visited on Monday. The museum is closed. But on the yard there are some amazing monuments, as well as outdoor museum of weapons including B52 aircraft . recommended."
Definitely a must see museum in Seoul,Such an interesting presentation to make you feel the atmosphere of Korean war time. This place not only shows very informative details but also presents many aspects of the war. Totally recommended.
Very delusional,The Korean perspective on the war is in line with the typical Korean perspective on things. They were getting beat down; which they do admit a little. They do recognize the help they received from nations throughout the world but they minimize the American involvement that turned the war around. The minimal recognition of the American effort and loss is disrespectful and insulting. But that's Korean. 
It's like a box of chocolate,"Since I went with a tour guide, I can’t really speak for everyone because it all depends on the service. And since I can’t speak for anyone, I’ll be talking about how my trip went. So when we first arrive, it was crowded, full of people, and full of liter. But I thought it was just little things, and that I can worry less about it.  While just looking through away, the buildings are really interesting and massive, I have gone through the history of Korea and the origins of time. There’s only a little bit of English translation so if you’re a foreigner you might get bored easily."
an amazing place,i really liked this place. its good for history seekers surely they will love it. also there are things thats belong to the museum but outside. You can ride it 
A place worth the effort to visit,"We joined the Seoul city tour and this was our second stop. This place is really big and it is so well displayed for all that we needed to know about warfare, weapons and vehicles. We didn't managed to go through the entire site coz it was really big. We missed the outside monuments coz we concentrated on the inside. I really would recommend this place very much evening though I don't like to see about the effects of war and combat. Every single persons who were perished where were taken into account and their names were engraved on the wall. Well done. "
War what is it good for,A great place to learn about the harshness and the reality of war. Free entry for the exhibition and lots of activity on the outside.
Interesting but poorly organized ,Probably a must see but I was not really thrilled. Building is massive and you will go through the entire history of Korea through the wars that they fought since the origine of time. Very little translation in English so you get bored rapidly. There are some old military junk outside which probably will make kids happy. 
"Interesting, honest, engaging","So much to see! Open and honest representation of the war, how it affected Korea and the world. Dioramas and exhibits and films are detailed, sometimes hard to watch, but very interesting. Rooms dedicated to peace and reunification are beautiful. Really a must-see."
Impressive place ,Very impressive facility. Outside are displays of aircraft and tanks and more. Inside is a beautiful museum consisting of three floors displaying history of all wars korea has had to fight through dating back to pre dynasty up to present. 
"Cool exhibitions, heavy on the propaganda","Place is alright. It's free and definitely had some pretty impressive exhibitions - especially if you're a military history buff. Ultimately the place felt way too propaganda-y for me. It is quite apparent that the history is more about narrative. More like something I'd expect north of the border. Still, probably worth an hour or 2."
Huge museum. Very interesting,Very interesting and well laid out museum. You end up walking a lot as the museum is so big. Lots of military hardware in the outside space too. It's also free to visit. Well worth a visit.
Don't go on a Monday!,Unfortunately we made the mistake of not doing our research and going on a Monday when it is closed! However we were still able to access all the outdoor exhibitions and monuments. Luckily it was a beautiful spring day and we enjoyed viewing the replica aircraft.
Lots to see,"The War Memorial of Korea had a lot for our family to see. It gave a great background to the war in Korea along with videos, testimonials, and lots of information. We rushed through it, but could have easily spent 4 hours there."
Very nice museum,"Very informative material and smartly exhibited. There ' s a huge space outside with war airplanes, fountains and two museums for kids. The entrance is free and everything has an english translation or version, including the interesting and touching videos on the top floor. The architecture and the way the space inside is managed is, as in each korean museum that I ' ve seen, beautiful. "
Fascinating!,"A must see to help understand Korean history as well as the Korean war. Nicely done and very interesting. As an American, it helped my better understand the pride that Koreans have in their country and in their military. "
A must see when visiting Seoul ,"The war memorial is a great place to learn about the history of Korea throughout its existence, especially the part detailing the Korean War. Spent about 2 1/2 hours moving through the various exhibitions and spent most of the time enjoying the Korean Conflict displays. Most of the exhibits are printed in English, Hangul, Mandarin and Japanese. Outside there are numerous planes, tanks, military equipment and statues to observe. There is also a kids park attached to the memorial. Not sure how often they occur but was luck enough to watch a presentation of pageantry by the ROK armed forces at 1:30pm on Friday."
Incredible ,"This museum has pulled out all the stops. Retired military aircrafts, tanks and even a ship decorate the lawn outside. Entrance into the museum is free. Full background to the war is provided along with current relations with countries worldwide. Documents, clothing, weapons from the war are on display. Models illustrating Korea's involvement in the Vietnam war are very insightful. Short movies and clips captivate tourists as they move through the museum. We spent 4 hours there and could have easily spent longer. Definitely a must if in Seoul. "
bits of tears in my eyes...,"worth a visit... join the free guided tour. shows how much south koreans appreciate the global help during the korean war. good on ya south korea for being so advanced after being destroyed during the war!!! tears in my eyes and goosebumps for me, seeing many of the exhibit...some moving stories. "
Very interesting and relatively extensive collection of aircraft,"This is a nice opportunity to look at some of the military vehicles, aircraft and other equipment and events that Korea has experienced through war. This is well worth the visit. I recommend this and think it is a great place to start your view of Seoul."
So much more than I expected!,"I thought it was going to be like one of those war memorials you can find in the USA. And it's so much better!For starters, out side, you find a huge exibition of real tanks, missils, war airplanes from different decades. Then you enter the museum and you have lots of interesting exibitions, plus three 4D movies simulating battles in different momments of Korean History.This place is amazing and I recommend everybody to go there."
Informative,"This museum does an undoubtedly good job telling the story of the Korean War and of paying tribute to victim on both sides. Great efforts have also been made to show appreciation for international involvement and aid. I did however find the militarism a little disturbing after a while. There were certainly some stories about the war that were upsetting (appropriately enough), but there also seemed to be a glorification of the military that I found somewhat unsettling. "
Well documented part of history,This memorial is a very well documented and presented part of history. Outside the buildings is an overview of different kinds of transportation and defense equipment. The memorial at the front of the grounds are a piece of art and are highly recommended to be visited.Inside the buildings the layouts present a good overview. To see all I recommend to plan at least for half a day. Several places show videos. The exhibition is kept up to date and show also more recent historical events including samples of drones.The place is next to Samgakji station and therefore easy to reach.A highly recommended place to understand that part of history.
Fascinating,The attached museum is closed on a Monday but the outdoor area is permanently open. Really interesting and emotional place to visit if you are interested in the history of the Korean War. Drinks machines available and toilet and cafe facilities. 
Educational stop over to understand the war history,This is a good stop over if you have half a day to spare during the trip. You get to understand how the civil war started between North and South Korea after WWII. 
Lessons from the Past,"War Memorial of Korea is a place where we are reminded of the past. This is a huge place were war relics are kept. You can see vintage airplanes and rockets, navy boats and tanks in one place (open grounds). There are several ways to go there. One is by subway, line 4 exit Samjakji Station. The other is through bus. I was fortunate to ride a bus, No.73 which passed by this museum (there are other buses but i don't know). There are many out door sculptures and monuments. You can spend at most 2 hours in this place. "
Gracious Memorial to the Korean War and interesting place to view all things Military for Korea.,"Very big memorial , with touching lists of the many men and women who perished in the Korean War. It also is a museum with a floor dedicated to Korean Military History and other floors for the Korean War. There is also a modern era which highlights the Korean Militaries current equipment, complete with static and dynamic (including films, 3D, 4D films!) displays and a huge outdoor yard filled with planes including a B52 , a whole patrol boat! and lots of military vehicles like tanks, APCs, Canons etc. "
Did not know war could be this interesting!,"Went here because my husband insisted we do. At first I was not too keen after all, war is about death and destruction and I have zero interest in guns or tanks, right?Wrong. There is a lot of history in this place and it is actually very well presented that I could not help but be sucked in that by the end of the tour managed to gain a little more appreciation and respect for world history."
Interesting,The War Memorial of Korea Museum is very interesting to see. It explains the history of Korea in an pleasant way. It is quite big so plan 2h to do it. Outside of the museum you have the opportunity to see war machines.
Breathtaking Display of Hope and Horror,"Overwhelming in size and intensity, this Memorial is a stark reminder of Korea's still painful recent history and the unsettling fact that nothing is settled. The Museum is free and takes a couple of hours to absorb it all."
One-of-a-kind memorial!,"This is not like any other museums/ memorials. This one is nicely done up, carries you through the whole journey from the 3 kingdoms all the way to the U.N. involvement. Simply more than graphics on the wall, it is interactive and done up in a way that it's as if you have turned back time and relieved those historical moments. Some goosebumps moments as well, there's even a 4D cinema to allow you to experience how it is like to be in a war zone! We spent a good 3 hours there. Recommended for last day of travel, it is quite a distance from central Seoul, so plan your itinerary for this and head to Gyeongbokgung area for the Korean Ginseng chicken! And a few stops away from Hongdae station for the shopping streets!"
A must see.,I am a little biased because I am a history buff but the war is so crucial to understanding modern life in S Korea that visitors should learn as much about it as possible and this is a great place to do that. The exhibits are very informative and superbly layed out. I have been to many history museums but have never seen such amazing animated dioramas. There is also a very impressive collection of military vehicles outside including a complete B52 bomber. Definitely a must see when you are in Seoul.
Good historical museum,Very sad to see the names of the dead from all the different countries that helped during the war. Very well laid out and concentrated on Korean war and older wars in basement.
Good exhibition,This is one of the good exhibition about the war. The visualization and information will made you deeply into the war period. Need about 2 hours or more if you really want to study the study the war history. 
Pleasantly surprised,"We visited this museum because my father-in-law was interested in S.Korean history and we had 4 kids in tow ages 7-14. I thought they would be so bored but instead I was pleasantly surprised that they liked it. This is due in most part to the excellent exhibits that made the Korean war very interesting. An English-speaking guide gave us a 1hr tour. Although his English was a bit difficult to understand at times, we gathered enough information. They had many videos (one in 3d) and art installations that the kids thoroughly enjoyed so make sure you watch those. Then go out to the Peace Plaza and marvel at all the different planes and tanks, very well maintained I might add. Oh and did I mention that entrance is free?"
Interesting for all ages,"This is my favorite museum in Seoul. The displays are well done and labeled in English as well as Hangul. There are lots of interactive displays making it engaging for all ages. Some activities require a wait or time slot (the shooting range and the MacArthur 4D movie come to mind) but are usually worth it if you have the time. There are also beautiful statues and monuments outside, as well as a ton of old war planes, tanks and big guns outside that you can climb on and in. Highly recommend you give it at least 3-4 hours. "
Great lesson on the History of Korea!,"This was my first time here and I have to say I was quite impressed. From this visit you get a full understanding of the history of Korea, the dynasties, all the occupations from other countries, and what was happening in the rest of the world during these events. There's a children's museum that is good for young kids. The outdoor part with the planes, tanks, and ship is also a bonus. The entrance is free and they were giving out books on the history of Korea! Access to the museum is about a 5-10 minute walk from the subway station."
excellent life sized walk through memorial,"Loved this place!! Totally worth going to see, even if you aren't a History buff!! I had such a great time looking at all the warplanes, ships and tanks. It's great that you can actually go inside the tanks and aboard the ship!! was such a fun afternoon activity!! The memorial also is filled with cool information about the war - some of which i never knew before. Honestly - go see and experience it!"
amazing for everyone,"not only for boys, huge museum with great exterior exhibit and nice view, definitelly worth a visit, save at least 3 hours"
Nice stop if you're in the area,"Huge area showcasing the war history of Korea. Our group stopped by after we paid for our DMZ tour at Koridoor Tours. Did not go inside (it was Monday and it seemed empty) because we didn't want to spend money but there was plenty to see outside. Huge statues and there were old planes, tanks, etc. a beautifully designed memorial. Recommend stopping by for half an hour if you're in the area."
Airplanes and Tanks galore!,"If you are a history buff, this is a great place to visit! The museum is free to the public and there's a lot of history to go through. The structure is beautiful and very serene especially if you go right when they open at 9am. "
Must visit.. loved it!!!,"I visited war memorial with my family in the month of June. Make sure you visit the place when its not raining and the weather is sunny or atleast favourable. It's free of cost which was pretty amazing. History of korea is very well preserved. Loved the giant military statues of men outside the museum. They have a lot to cover outside as well as inside. For an outdoor view, you can have a look at various models like a giant military ship, military tanks and planes. And get yourself clicked. Indoor, they have a museum which showcase the korean war history. It was quite an interesting and a knowledgeable tour and we got to learn a lot about the korean history and war. They also have a canteen outside to sit and grab your meals. We carried out our own lunch so dont have much idea about the food services there. It took us about 4 hours to cover the entire place. All in all, a pretty amazing outing and definitely worth a visit."
"A must visit, very powerful museum","The War Memorial of Korea is must see for anyone who loves history. It is a lot to take in and spans the complete history of the Republic of Korea and tells one story that defines the nation. Definitely a s secret place that you would want to spend as much time as possible looking around and taking in the pride that the people of South Korea feel for their continued struggle for independence with a special emphasis on the Korean War.In addition to what seems like an limitless supply of relics dealing with Korea's military past, they have a collection of sculptures that will invoke a powerful emotion in almost all who see them. I suggest that everyone take the day and visit this museum. Even if you have young children this is a great place to take them. As you walk though you have a good chance to see this the museum full of elementary age school children from local schools learning from all the great exhibits.The museum was recently updated in March 2016 and like most all attractions in the Republic of Korea, this museum is English friendly."
Honor and Respect,"Our family trip to Seoul meant that we needed to pay our respects to all who served in the War. My father was in the 75th Mountain Div. and my wife's father was in the Navy, participated in the Inchon landing and received the Inchon Landing Commendation Medal. For us, and for our children, this was something we needed to see. What impressed us was the honor and respect shown by the Korean people for the sacrifice of those who participated in the War. There were several statements about how the United Nations forces responded and fought for people they did know, and a country they never heard of. Every MIA was listed, by State, on bronze tablets which paid respect to our soldiers, sailors and marines. I came away with the feeling that Koreans are truly grateful for the sacrifices our Country made. The Government spared no expense, and exhibits were very well done. Skip the 3D video of the Inchon landing as it is waste of time. It takes you through an animated bombardment. Instead, spend your time in seeing the history of the struggle. It was very well done. "
Great place to visit ,Great place to learn more about Korean history. It's really impressed. They protect and keep the objects very carefully. We learned a lot from this trip!
A must see during your trip to S Korea.. History impressively captured,"Beautiful and sacred war memorial dedicated to the struggles of North and South Korea. One cannot help but be moved by the sculptures and their descriptions. There is no fee to tour the grounds and the museum closes at 5PM. You will have an opportunity to walk amongst tanks and airplanes. In addition, you can view a replica of a boat that came under fire by the North Koreans as recent as 2002. Hot chocolate and coffee beverages are available for purchase through vending machines throughout the park."
Coolest Museum,"I learned so much about Korean military history in this museum, They even provide free books. There is a large display of equipment and aircraft including a B-52 bomber."
"War Memorial: a Museum, not a monument","The name may be slightly putting you in the wrong direction. It's a very big museum with a lot of information about Korea and it's wars from prehistoric ages untill the Korean War in the 1950's. It's impressive and very good if the whether is bad. It's also the only place I know to buy pins with the Korean flag and the different allied troops flags (like the Netherlands, Australia, Turkey, Luxemburg etc). "
Racist and sexist tour guide,"We visited on Sunday morning and were lucky enough to get a tour. Whilst we greatly appreciated the tour from the elderly tour guide, Lee, he ignored the two females in the group of four of us, only introducing himself to the two males in the group, and also only asked for the names of the males of the group. I may be wrong and maybe not addressing the women is a cultural thing? He also assumed the females in the group did not know anything and made some racist and sexist comments. He missed a lot of the features of the war museum. It's a shame as other tour guides we observed seemed to give a great tour of the museum. We went around the museum ourselves afterwards and were impressed with the free exhibition and the vehicles outside which could be climbed into by visitors."
A great museum,One of the best put museums I have even been to. With story telling exhibits. Numerous historical documents. Allow at least 3 hours to go through it. It is well worth it. It is also free of charge.
Absolutely brilliant!,"We never expected to stay here for 4 hours or more, but the War Memorial of Korea was massive, and very well done. And it's free.It is a huge complex - numerous statues outside and three storeys of displays inside the Memorial building, covering not only the Korean War (though this takes up the majority of it, for obvious reasons), but also South Korean involvement in the Vietnam War and other conflicts, as well as the early military history of the Korean Peninsula.The father of a friend of ours fought with the Australian Army in Korea (and indeed met his wife on R&R in Tokyo, married her and brought her home to Australia), so it has additional resonance for us Aussies. There is a lot of love for the members of the armed forces of other nations who fought for a people they didn't know in a country they'd never heard of in that 3 year war, and much is set aside for that purpose in the War Memorial of Korea.There are displays of current weaponry (guns that can shoot around corners, night vision equipment,,,).There are inside exhibitions of vehicles and planes, as well as a huge area outside with a selection of planes and artillery, tanks, missile launchers, helicopters, submersibles, and even a full-size replica of a warship damaged in a 2002 conflict between the North and the South. You can board the ship, look into the cockpit of planes, marvel at the size of a B-52 and transport planes, and see how cramped it was/is in troop carriers.There are statues depicting the meeting of two bothers on the battlefield - one from the North and one from the South, and of the Clock Tower of Peace (with one clock at the current time and one frozen at the time the Korean War started).There's the original cars presented by the USA and Russia respectively to the heads of State of South Korea and North Korea (a little one-upmanship, perhaps!).There's a moving display depicting the 2008 burial of an Australian wife, finally placed in the UN Memorial Cemetery, Korea, with her husband who died in the Korean War 58 years previously. There were a few of those stories.There's uniforms and other memorabilia from very other country involved in the conflict. And plenty of video, dioramas, 4D movies, etc, to experience.There's a rather telling display of the damage a nuclear weapon would do to Seoul, accompanied by current news reports of the North's continued advances in nuclear technology and military testing.On a brighter note, there are cafeterias and souvenirs, as well as toilets.Well worth a visit and a tribute to the Government of South Korea."
Must See the War Memorial of Korea,"Be sure to make time and visit the War Memorial if Korea when you are in Seoul! The exhibits and tie in with the living history is outstanding, Allow at least 3 hours for a full visit."
Learn history from the land of the people,"We took our time. There is a lot to look at some very graphic, but war is so it is to be expected. I wouldn't bring a young child. There are outside exhibits but it was raining the day we were there so I am not sure what all is out there. I think they had planes. So I will go back just to find out."
A definite to understand the psyche - this should be on your top 3 to visit,"We spent 5 hours here and could have been longer. It's an excellent museum. The outside exhibits are fantastic and set in an area that is easy to navigate and extensive. The only minus was the presence of the American elementary school. They seemed to think the exhibits were a modified theme park, they were noisy and disrepectful. There was an international school who were well behaved and there was also an Korean school who were clealry there to learn, but the American kids were simply there to shout and scream and Create a scene. On the plus side there is a dedicated children's museum and so we could shake them off. The inside exhibits were very much on a didactic model ( tell 'EM. What you're going to tell 'EM, tell 'EM and tell 'tell 'EM again ' but it simply works, there are lots of exhibits and the assortment of media really adds to the story of the 1950-53 war. The exhibits were a good combination of traditional and IT media. Overall excellent - this should be a must when visiting Seoul as it explains the current psychi of the south Koreans and understanding that peace was never achieved.It's easy to navigate on the excellent metro - we went from city hall. Only took about 20 mins in total . The metro is cheap and simple to get around . Personally I would allow at least 3.5 hours although we did much longer."
Great place to learn about the Korean War,"If you're a war buff, the War Memorial of Korea is a great place to visit. I'm amazed by how much the Korean government went through to preserve this critical moment in history so that new generations will never forget."
One of the best Museums,"Must watch for any war enthusiast and kids... What a museum. The planes, tanks and artillery kept outside is unbelievable. Must watch if you visit Seoul. Keep 4-5hrs spare time for this. "
OK if you are in the area and need to burn a half hour of time.,The most interesting part to me was seeing copies of American Military communications equipment. Some still in use in our military.
Peaceful and powerdul,A Korean friend took me to this museum when I first moved to Seoul. It's a really beautiful campus with a very serene atmosphere where you can learn a lot about the war history or take a relaxing stroll. Worth visiting if you have a lot of time in Seoul and if you enjoy museums and parks. 
Excellent Education,"Spent a few hours at the museum. Very educational, told the horrific story of the Korean War. Well worth a visit."
Great way to learn about the War History of Korea,A great place to understand what happened in the Korean War. Make sure you join one of the free tours (available in English). Personally think it's better than simply wandering around the museum on your own. Tip: Make full use of the free lockers opposite the information counter so you don't need to carry any bags or jackets!
National treasure,"Place of pride for the locals and a lesson in history for visiting tourists. No entrance fees, great exhibits. Some planes and cars to keep the interests of the young visitors."
A must see for anyone in Seoul,"A poignant reminder of the war that affected the Korean Peninsula almost 70 years ago. A sad sight to see the statues of brothers fighting brothers on different sides. The War Memorial's exhibits are very well done, informative about both sides in the Korean War and kids love the model US and NORK military hardware outside. You can even go inside one of the USAF planes. Best to go on a sunny day. "
Very educational,"This is definitely worth a visit. The museum is well laid out and there are directional signs to indicate the direction of flow. It is in a story telling approach which lets you learn a lot about the tumultuous past of South Korea, and how the world rallied together to stand behind her. There is also an outdoor area that displays the weapon system and armoured vehicles and planes used during the war, which I am sure even the little ones will approve of."
worth a visit,Entrance is free. it has outside area where all types of tanks and planes used in Korean wars are presentd. inside area is devided into wings for different war periods of korean history. worth a visit
The War Memorial in Seoul,It is located between the US military base at Yongsan and Itaewon (shopping and entertainment district).There are numerous planes and military hardware on display just outside of the museum. Inside you'll find a very good exhibit of the Korea War and other replicas from Korean military experiences thoughtout the centruies.Entrance is free and I believe it's closed on Mondays.I would say you need at least half a day to properly tour the museum.
Actually its great,"I was shocked that this was one of the best/top places to see in Seoul, but it's totally worth it. There are lots to do and see there plus its really beautiful. There's also an indoor part of the museum that has exhibitions at times. It's a great free activity to do."
Big statues and nothing else,theyre big statues and then theres a museum which is a war museum. it was eh at most theres not really anything around the war memorial. 
Must-see attraction,"Worth a visit to get a historical perspective of Korean war history. Lots of hands-on display (both indoor and outdoor) and entertaining videos,including some 3D movies. Huge place and need at least 3 hours to explore all the exhibits. Very well presented. Highly recommend it. "
Awesome,This is the place to go if you want to know about the Korean War. I was amazed by this place it was incredible!! It is a MUST see attraction.
The War Memorial,This place makes you to think about wars and offer many things that you did not know about Korean war
