Bus from Buan to Naesosa,"Thanks to Amanda for directions to local bus stop in Buan. The one for Naesosa is directly outside the Hi Dental Clinic and the timetable is attached. On the first Saturday of November there was a concert at Naesosa, only one a year apparently, brilliant. Lovely (but steep) trails around."
Beautiful temple,"It's one of my favorite 5 temples. Buseoksa, Gaesimsa, Muwisa, Nesosa and Unmunsa. I can feel comfortable whenever I'm here, it always makes me think who I am, where I am from and where I'm going to. It would be better sitting at front yard chair, simultaneously looking at the main building Daewoongjun and thinking of what I said above for a while."
Naesosa Temple,"This is my favorite temple to visit in the area, I have actually visited this temple in every season, from the car park it is a nice walk past the many restaurants and through the woodland to the temple, I am sure you can even have a nights stay at the temple and experience the way the monks live, it is not free but if you are interested in it why not give it a try, I personally haven't done this but I was told you can do it, on the way back from the temple stop of at one of the restaurants, have some food and if you are not driving have some Makgeollie. One piece of advise during Korean holiday this Temple is very busy, best to avoid travel at this time"
Naesosa Temple Stay,"Did a free-style temple stay and it was a very enriching experience. The Templestay coordinator (who speaks English) was helpful and thoughtful. The surrounding area is very good for walking/trekking. The landscape is pretty and the air is refreshing. The temple food is tasty. Indeed a rewarding trip. We travelled from Seoul To Jeongup by KTX, and then by bus to Naesosa."
Day Trip,"Okay so getting here was tricky. If you can it seems that you can see so much more more convuebtly if you have a car. I don't have a car. I took the interxity bus to Buan. After a short walk across the street, to the four way untersection, cross and then walk down the row of local buses on the right of the street. Then took the number 300 local bus to Naesosa. It takes about 1 hour and there is a ten minute break 30 minutes into the ride but you don't neet ro get odd there. The local bus is about 2,200 won. "
Serene and quiet,"Excellent location , between the mountains and natural beauty. Highlights of byseonbando national park. Offbeat location but beautiful. Other than the old temple the hike to jisokonpopko falls is tough but great. You need to be in good physical condition to do it "
Enjoyed my visit,I went to this temple with my school when first arrived in Korea. It was really nice and scenic. Great for pictures and taking in the sights.
"Good atmosphere, old temple..","CY ( 2015.12.30 ) This temple located in Byunsan National park, and had old main temple. The road to temple was very good and not so far. I couldn't find special thing, but all was good. Except tout in entrance, the road, atmosphere and temple was good. If you visit Byunsan National park, go this temple."
Beautiful Temple,"There is a very old tree at the entrance to this temple. Plenty of restaurants at the entrance too. When you pass the entrance, you will walk for about 15 minutes before reaching the temple. A great place."
