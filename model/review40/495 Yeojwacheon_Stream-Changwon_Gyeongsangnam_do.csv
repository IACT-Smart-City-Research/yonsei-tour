Lovely to See,"This a very photogenic area. There are beautiful statues and/or light structures in the riverbed that look nice in the day and would probably look amazing at night. Definitely bring a good camera, as there's many great photo opportunities. Going during the cherry blossom festival is quite nice, but be prepared for crowds. Many of the trees are intentionally situated to create specific spots for pictures, but it's still beautiful with full blooms out. Highly recommend going, but be patient."
Not as good as reviewed,Pictures on most reviews seem to let you see alot more cherry blossoms but in reality by walking along the bridges you can only see hanging cherry blossoms dangling along the stream. Too far for nice pictures. If you cannot wait for the lights to be up after 7pm then there is no need to spend alot of times walking through all the 3 bridges despite the different statues under the bridge as they dun look different. 
Romantic Bridge,"Super romantic when the cherry blossoms are in full bloom. I went third week of March and there were a few blooms seen. I guess it will be full in April.Nice to walk along or at the bottom.Just be careful as there are lots of small bees collecting nectar from the flowers. I am not sure how it will be when the whole stretch is blooming with flowers. How many bees will be buzzing about.Directions:. Jinhae Bus Terminal. Blue bus 160. You can take 150, 162 or Green bus 307, 309, 31. I used Blue 160. Alight at the 8th stop.. Walk to the traffic junction. Cross the road to the left. Walk straightThe stream is right ahead. "
jinhae in september,I am going to south Korea september 2018 and I will visit Jinhae. Is it beautiful that time? and can I see cherry blossom?
Beautiful Stream,Must go personally in order to have first hand experience of seeing and feeling the cherry blossom in full bloom.
Romantic ,Cherry blossom was awesome. This place felt very festive with food stands and cherry blossoms along a stream.
Beautiful Cherry Blossoms,"I heard that the Jinhae Cherry Blossom Festival is one of the best, so I booked a tour with Trazy. We took the KTX train from Seoul Station to Daegu and then took a bus to Changwon. Once we got to Changwon, we used a combination of taxi, rental car, local bus, and walking to get us to various sites.Yeojwacheon Stream is a beautiful little stream and walkway that is lined on both sides with beautiful cherry blossoms. It is a sight to behold when it’s in its full glory and loaded with blossoms. Unfortunately, it is a very popular destination, so be prepared to share the stream with throngs of people all trying to take selfies and get that special photo. Because of the crowds, it is better to visit during the week and very early in the morning, if possible. Having said that, I never found the crowds to be rude or unpleasant in any way. Everyone is there to enjoy the spectacular flowers and the warmer weather.The blooms only last a few days, so keep close tabs on the blossoms forecast to avoid disappointment. Also, there are beautiful cherry blossoms on Anmin road driving up the hill or mountain. There is a walking path if you can find a place to park your car (that’s why we had a rental car for part if the day). The cherry blossoms that line the road are gorgeous, and there are no crowds, at least none when we were there on a Wednesday. It is a great thing to do after visiting the Stream for a different perspective."
Beautiful day & night,"We arrived Yeojwacheon stream at 2nd of April, start with a sunny day, what we have seen was flowers every where!!! although there are all fill up with people, but at the phone zone, people will automatically queue up. At night some of the location will have light show. Highly recommended visit there both day and night."
Wish we could have seen it when the cherry blossoms were in bloom!,It was beautiful even when the trees were not in bloom. There is a nice wooden path lined on either side by cherry trees all the way. 
Breathtaking ,"The whole stream was covered by Cherry Blossoms and they even decorated it with artworks, there was a lit of food stalls on the street next to the stream, I would suggest to come here in the morning during the festival to avoid the crowded scene. Definitely one of the most magical experience I've ever had. :)"
cherry blossoms in a different light,Spent a day in Jinhae during the cherry blossom festival.. you need gps to get around! Our wifi egg wasn't working so no gps for us. We followed the sounds from the festival and asked around for directions. Jinhae people are very very friendly and will help even if there was a language barrier. A local gave us directions to the stream in the evening and we saw cherry blossoms in a different light - the flowers looked spectacular even at night. Beautiful but very very crowded.
Cherry Blossom Festival,I live here; quiet small area most of the year and very busy during the festival. Do not attempt to park in the area. For residents only during Cherry Blossom festival
Revisiting a memorable place,"To escape from the weekend crowds, we visited Jinhae on 31 Mar 2017. The flowers were beautiful although they were not in full bloom. What was different this time; we chose to make a day trip from Busan, taking the intercity bus from Seobu. The yellow flowers that used to line the little stream when we first came in 2014, however were no longer there. We saw what looked like fake tulips planted instead. Not sure why. Still a nice visit. "
Cherry blossoms' City Jinhae,"벚꽃축제기간에 유명한 장소이다. 저녁에는 아름다운 빛과 벚꽃이 어우려져 환상의 뷰를 자랑한다. 여좌천을 따라 올라가면 내수면 연구소에도 들를 수 있고, 예전 드라마 로망스로 유명해진 로망스 다리가 있다. 그 다리가 사진촬영의 핫스팟이다. There are many cheery blossom trees along the stream and some small bridges during cherry blossom festival. The bridgies is famous for Korean drama titled Romance. Especially the stream is the most beautiful at night. When you visit there at night, you might find beautiful illuminations on the stream. So I strongly reccommand this place."
Excellent place to visit,"The best time to visit is late March/ early April when the cherry blossoms flourish. Take the subway to Sasang station and then the long distance bus to Jinhae. From the bus station, walk to Yeojwacheon. It has a long stream with numerous crossing bridges. There is not much water in the stream so one can walk close to the stream. Avoid going there on the weekends or April 1 when the crowds are huge. The decorative lights come on at around 7 pm and the place is stunning. Leave by 8 pm to walk back to the Jinhae bus station to catch the last bus. One should see the cherry blossoms in the afternoon and then continue on to see them at night, to gain the full experience of the excitement. There are big crowds during the cherry blossom period (late March to early April) but the place is quite orderly (the visitors have good manners and do not push around)."
Beautiful Photo Spot,"I visited this spot during the annual cherry blossom festival. It was incredibly crowded. If you attempt to visit during festival time, please go early to make the beautiful photos possible. "
Beautiful Place for Cherry Blossom,"A beautiful place to watch the cherry blossom. Whole street are the cherry make the view very romantic. This place need to visit for both day and night. In the morning, you can see the beauty of the cherry. At night, there are the light with the cherry blossom, that make another picture of the place."
A must-visit in Spring!,"If you're looking for a place to really experience the cherry blossom season in Korea, then Jinhae is a must-visit. The best places to go are Yeojwacheon and Gyeonghwa Station. We went on the first day of the festival, just before the opening, and even though it wasn't a weekend, the place was packed with families and couples. There's lots of street food, but for Muslims and vegetarians, finding suitable food is not easy so I'd advise you to pack some bananas or sandwiches before coming down for the day ^^ For people staying in Busan, the best way to get here is by taking the bus from the Seobu Inter-city Bus Terminal."
Love it,We were there for the cherry blossom festival and it was great!! Loved the variety of street food and it wasn't that crowed the stream. We took a lot of good pictures to remember the good time we spend there.It is a must!
Breathtaking,We visited in April during the Cherry blossoms Festival. It's far from Seoul but the entire trip was so worth it. The entire place was filled with Cherry Blossoms in full bloom. Simply breathtaking!! The place is even more beautiful when the wind blows and the petals start to fall.. like snowing of petals... indeed a place not to be missed during Spring.
Awesome view of cherry blossom,"Went from seoul to masan by ktx 3hrs 40mins ride and from masan take bus to jinhae another 30mins ride . Although is v far , but the view there is awesome . The cherry blossom is v pretty . In deed worth visiting despite long journey ride . "
So photogenic with the blooming cherry blossoms,"We just visited this stream in Jinhae when the cherry blossoms were in full bloom. Simply amazing - the dense beautiful flowers were blocking most of the sky. So pretty that it would make girls scream and most jumping with joy and amazement. Well worth visiting during the 10 days to 2 weeks in beginning of April, but expect crowds, starting from queuing for the bus from Busan (at Sarsong Station). Still, not to be missed."
Beautiful cherry blossoms,The stream is beautiful during the cherry blossom seasons. Breathtaking views. There is a lot going on around the stream also. Tons of street food and vendors
Wonderful,"I come here in Spring Season - April 2015... The Cherry Blossom Festival, i go with my friends and fact.. Oh My God.... it's very AMAZING place with the Cherry Blossom around the bridge. If i have a time, next time i would like take my family for go there."
Brook Yeojwa in Changwon. ,"In spring, lots of people all around country come to see cherry blossom when a festival, Gunhangje (Navy Port Festival), is held in Changwon. At night, it is gorgeous to see cherry blossoms with colorful led lights."
Amaaazing,Don't ever miss April in this place.... It's more than wonderful. You will take At least 200 pictures in it and also you will enjoy street food
Blossoms Galore,"If you're anywhere in Korea during Cherry Blossom season you must make your way down to Jinhae. They are extraordinary! You will not be disappointed. The whole city becomes a festival. Lots of street vendors but most of all beautiful Cherry Blossoms. Walking along the stream provides an interesting perspective as you are much lower than the blossoms. A beautiful stream and bridges make for amazing photo opportunities. Really, don't miss it. If you've ever been to Washington, DC during the Cherry Blossoms you have some idea of the their beauty. Go, and take lots of pictures."
Great in the morning (during cherry blossom period),"During cherry blossom period, do come early in the morning before the crowd arrives. You'll get great photos / landscape scenaries as 1) there are less (or really a few) people and 2) petals of flowers will still be on the ground/walkway. The negative side is you'll not be able to get photos of the decorations with lights. We reached at about 10am and it was drizzling. We got great photos in the morning. The next day we came again in the evening to get photos with lights. Hence, we could compare. There were just too many people in the evening. The end of stream near Jinhae Train station side will have all the decorations like the colourful heart shapes, colourful umbrellas and floats. You can only walk on the road level and take photos from the top. The 2nd half of the stream, there are pathways where you can walk at the bottom along the stream. This is where we got great landscape photos. The best time to visit this stream is during the annual cherry blossom festival week. It was like a fair - many vendors along road selling food/drinks. There are also two tents managed by the tourism organization. Staff are very helpful. One of the tents provide help in English. Near the start of the steam, there is a road perpendicular to the stream (where there is a high school). There are rows of cherry blossom trees and benches along the road which would also good for photo taking."
Yeojwacheon Stream,"Yeojwacheon Stream (여좌천) area is well known as one of Jinhae’s best spots for viewing the famous cherry flower blossoms. It is also the location of the bridge where the two leading characters (Gwanu and Chaewon) of ‘Romance’, MBC’s TV series, first met as tourists who came to Jinhae to watch the Naval Port Festival. After the episode was aired, the bridge instantly became popular and widely known as the ‘Romance Bridge’. Each April the whole city of Jinhae is filled with cherry blossoms, but the Yeojwa Stream area has the most beautiful cherry blossom which makes it a prime tourist attraction."
A walk with romance feel,"Highly recommended during cherry blossom season. A long walk by the wooden path above the stream, with abundance of flower above and a cool breeze, perfect moment to calm your mind and enjoy the serenity. Listen to the stream of water, enjoying flowers, wonderful.https://vinshengloh.exposure.co/cherry-blossom-busan"
Beautiful in spring,"I loved walking along the stream during cherry blossom season! We took the train from Masan to Jinhae, and spent about 3 hours in Jinhae before returning to Masan. It's doable, because the next train would have had us spend 6 hours in Jinhae, which is really too much."
Do not miss this place during the cherry blossom season,"We planned our trip to Busan sometime in mid-2014 after some in-depth research on the blooming of cherry blossoms in Jinhae. We finally decided on early APR15 and arrived in Busan on 05APR15 and stayed for 4 nights. Unfortunately, it rained on and off almost every day and we were afraid that the cherry blossoms flowers may have dropped due to the rain. We went on the 3rd day when the weather was better. We took the metro to Sasang station and thereafter about 45 minutes bus ride from Seobu Bus Station (located just next the metro station) to Jinhae bus station. I would recommend that you travel on a weekday as the bus interval is 20 minutes instead of 1 hour during the weekends. Better to go early as boarding is first come first served.It was unbelievable that there were rows and rows of cherry blossom trees in the town. We had a bit of problem finding Yeojwacheon Stream but followed some of the other tourists who were more prepared then us. We arrived at about 10.00 am and there were already many visitors who started their journey earlier then us. The flowers were beautiful and you can take many photos at different locations along the stream. I really love this place which is so beautiful notwithstanding the crowd.There are many food stalls in the surrounding area if you feel hungry, and if you need assistance there are lots of booths for tourists and the people manning the booths can speak english and very helpful."
simply beautiful,"It was fortunate that our trip to Seoul was just in time for the blooming of Cherry Blossoms at Yeojwacheon Stream.To get to this wonderful place, go to Seoul station. From there, locate the Korail ticket booth. Remember your destination route should be SEOUL TO MASAN TO JINHAE. It is just a one way ride and though there are stops in between, your final exit is at Jinhae. You don't have to transfer from one train to another. From Jinhae station, you can walk all the way to Yeojwacheon Stream.Don't worry, they have lots of booths for tourists asking for directions who can speak english and are very courteous.Just to play safe, from Seoul Station buy a round trip ticket, not unless you are planning on an overnight stay. In our case, since our plan is to wander for just one whole day, we already bought tickets round trip to avail seats.Though it was a bit crowded, a lot of the groups come from tours so they do not really stay long due to time constraint.After the Yeojwacheon Stream, make sure to visit the Ecological Park, which is also a free attraction. Also a very beautiful place to just walk and admire God's creations."
A Walk to Remember Along Cherry Blossom Road (Yeojwacheon Stream),"Multitude of cherry blossom trees are lined on each side of Yeojwa Stream, forming a tunnel with pretty pink roof.. making it one of the top destinations in South Korea during Spring, well not to mention it was one of the locations of the Koreanovela ""Romance"" - the reason why there's this so-called ""Romance Bridge"". From Busan, take the bus from Seobu Bus Station bound for Hadong/Jinhae (Jinhae Intercity Bus Station is the last stop). Fare is W5100 and it will take an hour or so to reach Jinhae. You can take a cab from Jinhae Bus Station. But if you can, it's best to take a stroll going to the stream. It may take up to 30 minutes leisure walk, but since Jinhae's streets are actually packed with cherry blossoms, you won't notice the time. You will pass by their City Center, where the festivities actually happen - lots of events and FOOD! And then you'll pass by Jinhae Tower as well where you can see a 360-view of the town.From Jinhae Intercity Bus Station (last stop for the Bus coming from Busan - Seobu Bus Station), just walk back to where the bus came from... walk straight until you reach the intersection where the supermarket is. Cross the road then continue walking to your left towards Jinhae Train Station... right after the train station, turn right on the first block."
Must see during cherry blossom season!,"Just went. Must see!!!Cherry blossom festival runs for the first 2 weeks of starting 1st of April each year.Amazing to see the tree lined streets in full bloom. Jut note that where the bus takes you, is full of tents selling food as part of the festival. Just go to the info desk show a photo of the bridge and they will give you a map and mark directions.I wrote up some directions on how to get there:http://blog.fuelip.com/2015/04/seoul-to-busan-to-jinhae/"
Jinhae Yeojwacheon,"I put Jinhae in my Busan trip’s itinerary as I saw the beautiful picture on travel websites and found this breathtaking stream called Yeojwacheon. The Yeojwacheon Stream’s Wooden Walkway offers a unique view of the cherry blossom on top and canola flowers at the bottom along the stream. Taking photos in the middle of the footbridge across the stream, the far end is just perfect as a vanishing point of the photo ... http://wp.me/p5Lw9a-3H"
Cherry Blossoms Paradise!,"I went there for the Cherry Blossoms festival in the beginning of April with my classmates (a bus full foreigners!) and Korean Language teachers. We planned this trip since March but in the last minutes we got the information that the Cherry Blossoms were not fully blooming. Due to our very important examinations schedule in April, we can not delay the trip. When we came the festival is already began with various art performance, booths with local deliciacies and craft. Eventough all we saw around were only the baby cherry blossoms, but still, everything was beautiful, pink, calming and romantic! The Horse Drawn Wagons in the streets made Jinhae looks really like a fairy tale city. The main attraction beside the festival itself is of course the famous Yeojwacheon bridge. You'd better find a place for breakfast or lunch since you have to walk a bit far to the bridge and will spent hours to walk beneath the trees. You can find local restaurant very easily. I can't really remember how we get to the bridge (thanks to the guide of our native teacher). All I remember is I kept shooting with my pocket camera and can't stop seeing around. Next time I really have to come when the cherry blossoms fully blooming."
Beautiful walk even in September,"Knowing how beautiful it looks in Spring makes me want to come back. I have walked in this area today and it is still very special. Green and lush, well worth it. It looks as though the leaves are starting to turn and fall... Autumn on the way..very easy to get to, just turn right up the road after the Jinhae train station. Walk under the bridge and you are nearly there. Part of the walk has the massage foot stones! Most of the walk is on a wooden footpath."
Amazing!,"I visited Jinhae during the traditional Cherry Blossom Festival and was blown away at the amount of cherry blossom trees there. The tone was transformed into a big party where everyone was enjoying the festivities. After making my way through thousands of Koreans taking selfies with lovers or by themselves, I finally saw the stream and can vouch that it is very selfie worthy! A must to see if you are in Korea during the festival period. "
So beautiful during cherry blossom season!,"I visited Yeojwa Stream during the second week of April. Even though the cherry blossom has passed their peak, they are still beautiful. A must visit place for cherry blossom. The cherry blossom trees lined beside the stream with rapeseed flowers growing by the water. A really pretty sight!I traveled to Jinhae by bus from Busan via Seobu bus terminal which take about 1 hour to reach. Walking to Yeojwa Stream from Jinhae Intercity Bus Terminal took about 30 minutes. Seems long right? But you won't feel it because the whole town is painted with cherry blossom. Just enjoy your walk. :)"
Spring Like No Other,"Jinhae is the second out of Seoul place I have been in South Korea. This year marked my 6th time to be in this beautiful country and this is the first time that I have experienced an extra ordinary Spring. Jinhae is a small town near Masan and Busan within the the province of Gyeongsangnamdo. Luckily our period of stay is close to the biggest cherry blossoms in South Korea which coincides with the Gunhangjae festival which was set to happen April 1-10. We took a bus from Nambu Bus Terminal which took us straight to Jinhae in 4 hours travel. Since the festival is yet to start there is not Korail route straight to Jinhae. One has to take Masan and transfer to Jinhae. According to my friend the train ride saves you one hour but this is when the route directly takes you to Jinhae. I learned they make a special rail trip only during festival and so on an ordinary day, another one-hour bus ride from Masan is needed. Nevertheless, being in Jinhae a day before the actual festival was a good choice. First, we never encountered the traffic that is being mentioned on reviews. Second, the cherry trees are almost in full bloom already. Third, there is an opening activity prior to the actual festival so all the food stalls are already in place and there were programs as well. From the moment we got off the bus in Jinhae Terminal, cherry blossoms welcomed us. Because cherry blossoms were everywhere we never took a bus or taxi to go to Yeojwacheon (stream where the cherry trees are abundant). We walked around and returned to the bus station by foot as well. We almost failed to to take our lunch in awe to the place. The street food kept us fuelled enjoying our leisurely walk. The government did a lot of preparation for the festival. Portable comfort rooms were set up on strategic locations. There were also uniformed marshal whom i think are police. These marshals despite limited English communication were very helpful. A trip to Jinhae on a spring is definitely a must!"
"Awesome, super amazing and never let me down","Due to my last year experience, I really enjoyed the cherry blossoms in South Korea. So thankful that I managed to visit Busan, Gyeongju and Seoul again between 1-5 April 2014. I went to Jinhae, that is a city near Busan and a must visit for cherry blossoms, the full bloom of cherry trees all over the city, it was awesome, amazing and stunning."
Beautiful but crowded,"Very beautiful when the flowers blooming. Please go earlier, say before 9:00, in order to enjoy the beautiful scene quitely."
A visit to Jinhae -it is about timing right and the cherry blossoms are breath taking,"Found out Jinhae is 'the' place for cherry blossoms and this stream is a not-to-be missed.The stream is really beautiful with cherry blossoms lining the tiny boardwalk on either sides. For certain sections, you can walk down to the banks and see pretty little yellow flowers along the stream for some 1.5 km.We spent a good time of our day visit to Jinhae along this stream, basking in the sights of the plentiful cherry blossoms that lined almost all streets in this tiny town, and not just along the stream.You would not be hungry here - it is a street food paradise - so many of them - even the ubiquitous turkish kebab and icecream, and even barista-brewed coffee - alongside the stream. A little bit pitiful that the tops of the colorful tents somewhat marred the breath taking views of the cherry blossoms when photograph taking but then again, it kind of added to the charm.At the end of the stream is the entrance to the ecopark. Worth a visit too - free entrance. There are more cherry blossoms and those by the small lake, in the early evening with the low sun, provide opportunities for lovely photo shoots. While strolling around the lake, you can see the slopes of the surrounding mountains having huge pockets of pinkish white of cherry blossoms trees. We were really fortunate that we got our timing right and we were blessed with such beautiful sights of cherry blossoms that this must be the highlight of our entire 7-day trip to Seoul (we made a return day trip here, taking the KTX and Mugunghwa at 9 am from Seoul and back to Seoul, slightly past midnight). It was worth the numerous attempts on Korail website to reserve the tickets as up to two weeks before, no suitable tickets were available, and just one week before the trip, we managed to reserve them online.If only Trip Advisor could let me rate this 7 stars, I would."
Most Beautiful Spot to See Cherry Blossom Festival,"Yeojwacheon Stream is located in Jinhae, famous for cherry blossom festival in South Korea.The stream goes around 2km with beautiful trees on both sides. you can walk along the stream and see the magnificent view of a city turning into white because of the blossoming flowers!Prepare for traffic in advance, and choose the right time to visit (it's only beautiful when the cherry blossom already out). Commitee provides free shuttle bus but not all places is covered by the routes. On weekend, you will easily find street food nearby with dozens of options. Tourist information (english speaking) also available. Not so many restaurant available here, so you have to walk to Jungwon-rotary to get some meal."
MUST SEE,"The Cherry Blossoms in South Korea are a HUGE hit and very beautiful. As a resident of the area I can tell you that it gets extremely crowded and traffic can be a nightmare. There is virtually NO traffic in this quiet section of South Korea, but when the Cherry Blossoms are out.... what is usually a 20 minute drive is now more of a 4 hour crawl. The good news is that you get to see all of the Cherry Blossoms while you are crawling along. Plenty of time to get out and take pictures without holding anything up. Just leave your car in the street... Like everyone else!"
