Gondola to Dragon Peak/ Rainbow Slopes,"If you are skiing at Yongpyong, riding this gondola is included in your lift ticket (but closed to the public for the olympics until summer 2018). Non skiiers can also buy tickets. The ride is about 15 minutes one way, so you def get your money's worth. During winter, the snow scenery is amazing. Peak is at 1450 m above sea level so even when there isnt much snow at the base, there is usally snow up here. VERY windy, dress warm! Good place to play in the snow, drink a coffee and of course access rainbow slopes, the best skiing in Korea. Nice views in summer too!"
