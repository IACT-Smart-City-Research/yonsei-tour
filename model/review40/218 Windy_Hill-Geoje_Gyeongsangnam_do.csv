very windy,"it was amazing view, but very very windy. no wonder why they named it “windy hill”. oh and there are many stairs, so if you are carrying little baby, i do not recommend coming here :( "
the place to be seen,the place to be seen. the best gate away in geoje. you will experience fresh and cool air in December to march
Great views from what is basically a windy sight,Its a windmill similar to that you would see in Netherlands but much smaller. It is not operational and looks to b more of a model. But there are some lovely cliff side walks along the bay and the wind is a constant cool stream off the sea. Go eraly in the morning in order to get a parking space as its always been busy when I have visited.
Windy Hill,"The view was very good.. One of the must visit places in Geoje. I have visited twice and when compared to other places, this one is always a little crowded."
Lovely view of the coast line,"It was a beautiful spring day very little wind, we drove down the coastline from Okpo-dong to Windy Hill, parking was scarce as the place was so busy. We decided to park up at the coffee shop Angel in us. You get a great view of the bay and the windmill from inside nice to sit and chat over a coffee with a great view on the side. We left the car there and took the quick walk to the windmill, its there you feel the sea breeze, fresh and lovely views. You can walk on further but we did not want to hog the parking slot at the coffee shop so we returned and left. The drive back we took the mountain inner road route the roads sidelined for the climb with beautiful cherry blossom trees. A lovely drive back with spectacular high point views along the way."
"Quaint village, amazing views!","The fishing village at the end of our drive to Windy Hill was very quaint! Locals with nets laid out in the sun checking (repairing), anchovies laid out to dry. Very helpful & polite man whose van was setup with travel brochures. The walk around the area & up to the windmill was very well maintained & an easy walk. Several flights of steps, concreted pathways.Views were stunning on the clear, sunny day we went, although the temperature was very cold. Recommend wrap up warm, if visiting in the winter months."
A must visit for nature lovers,We visited Windy Hill as part of a tour package and it was easily the best part of the tour. The views were stunning and the seafood restaurants nearby were all delicious. A must visit if you wish to impress your partner. 
love this place and the sea,The view is the highlight from this view point. I got my driver to drop me at this point and it was a exhilarating view seeing the blue sea and enjoying cool wind here. Would return here again if i return to this side of korea.
"Refreshing breeze, fabulous panoramic views and beautiful windmill from a hill top","My family and I spent a wonderful 2 hours at Windy Hill after our Oedo Botania trip.Getting there:We drove 2 hours on a AJ (Avis) rental car from Busan city centre to the peaceful Dojangpo village of Geoje Island, where Windy Hill is situated. No fees for car park and similarly no entrance fee for Windy Hill. The attraction: Before 2002, Windy Hill was used to be known as “Ttibatneul” (meaning “vast green field”). It became famous after a few popular Korean dramas (e.g. Garden of Eve, Wooden Horse Carousel) as well as the entertainment program Two Days and One Night were filmed here. As with all visitors who were there, an easy climb (walk) to the windmill – synonymous with Windy Hill – is a must-do activity. From the top, we enjoyed the fabulous panorama of the south east coast of Geoje Island covering the Hallyeohaesan National Park, Dojangpo Wharf (ferry departure for Oedo Island), Hakdong village, Oedo Island, lalang fields, Sea of Japan and the surrounding cliffs. You could go further behind the windmill and you get a great photograph of the windmill sitting amidst the surrounding landscape. At the base of the attraction (i.e. the land tip), you could see shades of blue, turquoise and green of the sea water where the sea touches the rocks – really beautiful. The best part was while we were enjoying the panorama, the gentle sea breeze kept blowing at us – and it’s so refreshing such that we forgot our stress and tiredness! If you are hungry, thirsty or tired after the walk, you could go to the restaurants at the Wharf as well as at The Twosome Place. If you would like to buy dried fish (not sure what the name of the fish is), then there is also a shop selling these and sunning the fish. If you are travelling to Geoje Island for the first time (like me) or if you are wondering where to get great photographs and Instagram-worthy wefies and selfies of fabulous landscapes in South Korea, then Windy Hill has to make it on your list. Don’t miss this iconic attraction!"
Geoje Blue City Tours,"I used Geoje Blue City Tours to get around the eastern side of the island and enjoy must-see places like Windy Hill, which was stunning. For 15,000 won I took an 8 hour bus ride that included not only Windy Hill but the western-style botanical garden in Hallyeohaesang National Park on Odeo island, and the stunning Sinseondae Windmill. My charming guide Mr. Kim spoke English and went out of his way to include me as I was the only non-Korean. Although the traditional lunch of anchovies three ways nor the price of admission to some of the sights were included (All together the day cost about $50), it was an awesome, easy way to see the major attractions. Because I was traveling solo, the website wouldn't allow me to make a reservation. I called and was instructed by the guide to just show up at the main bus terminal which made me a little nervous but everything was above board. If you have only a few days and want to see as much as you can without stress, I highly recommend this tour."
Windy Hill with beautiful view and cool wind..,"CY ( 18.05.16 ) I and my wife visited this attraction because there was landmark in this area. The hill was good mood with windmill. We appreciated there's view and mood, that's good. The cool wind was more good to us. There was very good point to walk with wind. If you bring a car, must park in yellow line. If you park white line, someone come and ask parking fee because there was private land."
Any time in year... Good to Go,Want to come here one more time with family. Nice place. Scenic view from top. Quite and calm. Remote place so might not have fetch foreigners attractions but one of those most places in Korea
Truly windy area,It;s a very windy area where some of the famous Korean movies took significant scenes. It starts with a coastal walk then uphill to a windmill where most tourists will spend majority of their ime taking photos.
Nice view at the southern end of Gojae,"A good stop if you drive around, less so for a special detour. Pretty views in clear days. There are boats leaving from here to sail around the nearby islands. Coffewshops too."
Unusual Dutch windmill in Korea,Dutch windmill situated on a headland towards the south of Geoje Island. Pleasant drive to see the site and easy walk to view the windmill and coastal scenes. plenty of food outlets on hand for a lunch and makes for a nice relaxing day away from work
"True to its name, great view of the sea","We were driven here, so I'm not sure if there is a bus available as a local told me that buses in Geoje may not be reliable or punctual. You get a good view of the sea, and we went close to sunset time so our photos turned out very nice! This is a famous photo spot so you'll see many people taking a photo with the windmill, or depending on the weather, they may even just sit and enjoy the view. Not recommended to go when it is cloudy or misty, as your photos won't turn out nice, and the islands won't be as visible. "
A scenic vantage point,"Windy Hill lived up to its name; it was quite blustery at the top. The windmill is a novelty in itself, but you also get a great view out over the sea. There's also a walkway that takes you a little bit out into the sea."
Good views from the top,Today weather helped us to enjoy this place. From here you can take boats for fishing or ferry to Oded island or have lunch. 
Windmill out of place,"Stunning views from the windmill hill, but the windmill itself just seems oddly out of place to me. Hordes of people, even on a weekday, didn't improve my impressions."
A windmill in South Korea!,"It seemed unusual to see a windmill in South Korea, but as a tourist attraction it was very busy. It has lovely views from the area around the windmill. "
Lovely walk. Fantastic views,Quite the drive to get there but the views and photo ops are amazing. A fair bit of a hike to get to the windmill but it's a nice stroll through a small art village.The sea views are incredible. A must do if visiting Geoje Island.It is WINDY hill so take a cardigan or sweater.
Great view,This place gives you a 360 degree view of the see. Many people are there with their selfie stick for their phone. Its great to stop by if you are driving that area but not a place to make a trip for it. 
Definitely Windy,"Just make sure you've got a coat & a camera, then you're set. Definitely steep & hilly with lots of steps, plus need to watch your step as some areas are uneven. "
Beautiful place to visit if you like nature. A windmill at the top of a hill with blue sky. Looks fantastic. ,Should visit if you like nature. A windmill at the top of the hill with blue sea. Looks stunning if you visit in sunny weather.. 
Let the wind blow in your gold-i-locks!,"I met some older Korean ladies and they extended the opportunity to explore the island with them and go to the windy hill in particular. There were a lot of people in the area but it wasn't too crowded, and there were a bunch of small little spots to stop and grab some food. It's a wonderful little port to see some boats and enjoy some fresh air at the top of the landmark. I went with a woman who was in her 50's and she beat us to the top! Lovely place for a day trip "
Might be interesting for kids,"It's a small hill with a wind mill on top. The amount of wind is nothing astonishing. Maybe a worth visit if going to the southern part of the island (Hakdong and below). Easy way to spend 30 minutes if there's nothing else to do. There were no activities and not many people in the middle of october, though the whole south-east side of the island was quite abandoned."
a pretty one in geoje,"I came there on a rainy day, but still fascinating, the view was pretty enough, and instagramable. If you go there don't forget to wear your jacket because it was so windy."
Pretty views,"This is a nice little scenic spot and I would recommend it to anyone doing a tour around the island. Don't go out of your way to do this alone but make it part of a few things to do in a day or two as its a bit out of the way too. And yes, it can be very windy so hold onto your hats!"
it is really a windy location,The location is amazing and cold ..recommend you to wear a warm clothing to survive.. The road to the windy Hill is also surrounded by nice cafes 
A very not typical Korean place to visit,"Contrasts, that is the most specific word to be used for this place. A Dutch type windmill in the middle of a steep hill, plenty of wind at times & a gorgeous view of the surrounding Korean sea. A must place to visit"
그냥 그래요 soso,바람이 많이 불긴 하지만 태양이 강해서 여름에는 좋지 않아요. 바다 보는 데에는 괜찮은 곳입니다. 그렇지만 언덕 밖에서 언덕을 보는게 가장 괜찮고 언덕 자체는 그닥인 것 같아요. Visit other place if you want to enjoy the sea.
best place.,if you really want to visit this place then i must suggest you to go weekdays rather than weekend . busan to geoje road drive will make you feel like osm.
Relaxing place,Been here 3 times enjoyed the view everytime. Drove to get there nice views on the way too. Public transportation here is not tourist friendly. Better to rent a car and drive.Most rental cars have gps in them
Just a windmill... ,"For Europeans it is just a faked windmill but for Koreans it seems to be the most amazing thing in the world. We spend more than one hour in the traffic jam on the way to windy hill and finally we just got a copy of an European windmill. Anyhow, we had a good time and got a coffee in one of the surrounded coffee shops. "
Must visit place,We visited Windy Hill last January 2. The weather is fair but temperature is at -1 degrees. It is a nice place to see the small community onshore and to feel the cool breeze of fresh air. We reached the area by taxi. This place is quite popular attraction so expect some traffic while traveling here.
Must be at the top of your itinerary...,"After my recent trip to Mundong Waterfall, we were craving for a more natural outing. So we decided upon Windy Hill this time around. Its a small peninsula with a beautiful windmill, spectacular water & cliff to complete the picture. Geoje is abundant in natural beauty. There are many places to visit. There is a regular bus service from Gohyeon Bus terminal. But the frequency is low. You will have to wait at least for 45 minutes to an hour for a bus. You can also hire a taxi. A must visit place!"
Refreshing view,"From a fishy village, you can walk up to see the windmill. It feels like europe for once! The view from top is refreshing with a mix of small town, hills & the sea, if you turn 360 degrees. Don't forget to bring your camera with you, although nowadays a smartphone can do just fine!"
Amazing views,Worth the trek to get there. Views are gorgeous and the water is as others have said turquoise. Hiking shoes are preferable as it is hilly terrain 
Refreshing Sight,"The hill took its name from strong gusts of wind rolling in from the southern seas of Korea. The highlight of Windy Hill is a huge wind mill surrounded by vast greeneries. From its gentle slope you can get a refreshing view of surrounding islands, the seemingly endless stretch of turquoise water, the fishing village of Dojangpo, and the wharf from where one can take a tour ferry to Oedo Island and Haegeumgang River.Travel Info: Open daily // Admission is freeTo Get There: From Express Bus Terminal in Seoul, take an express bus bound for Gohyeon Bus Terminal. Take a taxi to the venue."
