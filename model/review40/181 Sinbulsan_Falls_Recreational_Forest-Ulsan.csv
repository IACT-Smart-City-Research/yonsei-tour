Waterfall inside forest,"This waterfall is located inside the forest, barely 30 mins from parking area. Great for long walks and family outings."
Great hiking trails with easy as well as more advanced options.,Shinbulsan has great hiking trails with easy as well as more advanced options. There is plenty of natural scenery to be found at Sinbulsan. It's the perfect place to get out of the city for some fresh air. 
Nice waterfall,30 minute walking distance from the parking lot. Very nice and calm place. Surroundings are very beautiful. Enjoyed it. Good place for the people who love nature and hiking. 
Sinbulsan Reed PArk,"An interesting complex. in the middle of nowhere (so to speak) a huge car park, a Korean theater and access to one of the beautiful areas to walk. Excellent parking and good walking, nice waterfall. gets a bit crowded on Sundays"
