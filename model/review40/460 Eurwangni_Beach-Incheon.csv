"Small, dirty, and overcrowded","1. The beach itself is poor. Do not go there after the low tide: the water is really muddy. Well, there is a shower, and it helps, but do you really want to swim in a muddy puddle like Peppa Pig?2. The infrastructure is great. Around the beach, there is a playground, a sports area, two bus stops (you can reach Incheon by bus!), several beach shops."
Small beach in comparison to the other beaches in Korea,Smaller in scale but a nice beach to visit. It's fairly clean and the water is a little dingy but there was a lot of young people swimming and playing in the beach. Parking in the beach is pretty accessible but not free. If you want to park close to the beach you have to be a customer of one of the restaurants there. The FREE parking lot is a little bit tucked away from the beach and a little bit of a walk. So wear comfortable shoes. Oh and I don't think there's showers there either.
For a Californian that needed a beach fix!,"It was a satisfying beach day for us. We played and had plenty of sun and water. A few notes. Look at the tide charts and come at high tide as low tide has wire traps exposed. Also, some discuss the cleanliness if the Incheon coastal water. We did not fuss about that and had a fantastic day. Fun rocks and coves to climb on. Enjoy!"
Nice Simple Beach. Great for eating Clams. ,Simple beach. Great for eating clams. Not too great for swimming - dirty. Advise going in season and having fresh clams. 
The absolute worst,"If i could give this a -20 I would. Do not believe those that are saying this is a nice spot. This is the most polluted beach I have ever seen. I have never seen a beach with brown water. There is small dead fish all over the place. I couldn't believe people were actually in the water and I couldn't believe people were letting their kids in that nasty water. The boardwalk area at 1st seems like a good place to shop. Do not, I repeat DO NOT, waste your time. The only thing they sell is things for the beach ie beach balls, etc. This old lady tried to charge me $30krw to rent an umbrella. The whole place is garbage. Do not waste your time on this place. It is disgusting. "
Nice beach,"Although a small beach, it's a nice place to visit. Lot of crowd during the weekend. Lots of sea food restaurants."
Nice enough Beach to visit for the day but don't stay overnight.,"It's nice enough Beach to visit for the day. Full of expensive seafood restaurants. Also lots of nice coffee bars. A cappuccino costs 4,000, around £3.00. Visit for the day but don't stay overnight. We made the mistake of doing so. People come and camp out on the beach and then set off fireworks all night long. We stayed 2 nights. The first night, fireworks were going off till 0330. The second night, 0500. How can anyone sleep? We couldn't wait to leave."
Explore area surrounding beach,"Many coffee shops surround beach. Follow cement path leading to popular fishing spot (also a small seafood & coffee shop there). If you're adventurous, head up (from the cement path) steep unmarked trails to a rocky outlook with excellent views of beaches in both directions."
one of the very few good beach when escape from Seoul,"Very few good beaches around Seoul, if you do not go Busan, or Eastern side of the country. This beach is close to the airport, if you have time either before or after going into Seoul, this is one of the choice to walk on the beach. The sand quality is acceptable, there are many clams hidding under. Also many seagull will chase you for food. Sunset should be beautiful from the direction, but we're on the cloudy day. Many many seafood stalls there, if you parked opposite to their stall, the staff will come out and walk across theroad to greet you, if you just want to walk on the beach, they will ask you to park other place even there are many empty space. Finally, I parked on the beach side, again a man came to greet me and lead me to a stall. I understand if I don't eat something I can't park the car there and walk on the beach, so I ate something cheap, half kg of middle size prawn cost50000won, steamed, taste ok, but understand this is a touist price.After the meal, the man is very nice to help us taking photos, and suggested us to feed the seagull. It is really enjoyable."
THE beach of Korea,This beach is so lovely and enjoyable! It's crazy to think that Incheon is quite north (korea and worldwide speaking) but there is this south-asia alike beach with very warm water on summer!Just grab a bus from Songdo to reach this beach in about 1h30
Really great Korean beach on airport island!,The beach is very clean and clear of rocks or trash. The restaurants along the beach and the convenience stores have recently been renovated and updated so everything is looking very new and upscale. This wide beach has enough room for everybody! You can even set up your tent and grill. When the tide is in the swimming is lovely- when it's out forget about it. So check tide times. In summer they float a dock out in the water and you can rent ski-doos or be towed behind a motor boat on a float of your choosing.
Turist trip,Just taking rest. But water wasn't as much as clean. But suitable time to swim and warm water. Easy to get from Incheon airport
Not a beach to layout on but to go for seafood and relax,"I wouldn't consider this a beach I would layout on (rocky, pebbly sand) or go in the water for a swim (kinda dirty, not-blue water), but perfect for going to one of the seafood restaurants right on the beach for a Korean style clambake. We checked out of our hotel and since our flight wasn't until 7pm and Eurwangni Beach is near the airport (~40 min; ~1-1.5 hrs from Seoul), we went here for something different and outside of Seoul. We randomly picked one of the many seafood places on the beach and got various kinds of clams to grill up as well as squid, scallop and shrimp, which went perfectly with some cold beer. We lucked out with perfect weather and since it was a Monday not in the middle of summer, the area was empty. I'm not sure I would come here for more than what we did but all the factors lined up for us and it was a great relaxing way to end our trip."
Low-key but still quite enjoyable,"Located close to Incheon and at a reachable distance from Seoul. There are many seafood restaurants and convenient stores around, where you can just grab a drink and some snacks. I wouldn't call it a white sand beach, however, there are lots of white shells washed upon the shore, so you should wear appropriate (aka safe and comfortable) footwear. Sadly, the beach is quite dirty, people tend to leave their plastic utensils and even their socks on the shore, which is quite disappointing.. Even though, if you're staying in Seoul but lack the time/energy to make a trip to Busan or Jeju, to see the other popular beaches around, then it can be a satisfying option for a day trip, just to breath some fresh air. We went on a Saturday and it wasn't too crowded, a few campers and a very few tourists were roaming around."
so beautiful,beautiful beach!!! we saw the sunset here with awesome horizon!!! so nice place if you could visit summer time due to seal is so cold in winter
1 night 2 days trip,"Take Line no. 1 Subway to Dong-Incheon Station, then take no. 306 Bus in front of that station. This bus is reached directly to Eurwangni Beach. You can choose any small motel, hotel or pension when you arrived at there. For our case, we made online booking in one pension. The quality of the pension is just so so but we can enjoy the BBQ dinner in front of our room. In that case, needed to buy meat and some vegetables before taking the bus. The time walking along the beach is so nice as there are so many sea birds and you can feed snacks to them. After that we went to fairy rock which is also the land mark of Eurwangni Beach. At night, we played firework on the beach. Next day morning, we rent the ATV bike and move around the whole island. The price is 30,000 Won per hour. Then went to sea shells bbq restaurant for lunch. By the time waiting the bus to go back, enjoyed the umbrella hook ice-cream which is popular in Korea these days. An enjoyable trip but some places are needed to keep to be clean for natural beauty."
Crowded and dirty!,"It's nice to take a break from city life but the place is extremely crowded on weekends and it's difficult to move around, let alone find a nice spot to lay your towel or swim in the ocean. The beach was dirty with rubish everywhere and the colour of the water was not inviting. There are plenty of restaurants and cafés in the main street. It's sifficult to move around with a car / find a parking place."
Too much people,"It is close to the airport and the beach is ok, but a lot of people there, I didn't enjoy it that much, my kid loved play with the sand. It is clean and a lot of restaurants there, so just to visit to eat and spend a little time there is a good option"
Not good,1. Muddy beach2. Some kind of oily feel after touching the sea water for 5 minutes.3. Found difficulty in finding a car parking placeOverall we did not like the beach.
