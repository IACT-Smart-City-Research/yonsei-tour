Visit Hwaseong Fortress and Haenggung Palace,"This UNESCO world heritage site is about an hour and a half south of Seoul. I did this on my own. You can take the metro to Suwon station and then take a bus. Check with the tourist information office at Suwon station for details of the bus if you are confused.You need atleast half a day to do justice to this attraction. Entry ticket to the palace is 1,500 Korean won. There is a lot of walking and steep climbs, so be prepared. Don't miss the delicious dumplings sold in tiny restaurants in Suwon. On the way back I entered the food hall at Suwon station, a haven for yummy Korean food."
Must do,"Just wonderful on fine day. Great to walk around the walls, stop and see the towers, bells and view points. The marsall arts display is free and worth watching. "
A must see,"It is easy to get there. Just need to take the bus from the suwon train station, or you can go by foot and take a look at the city.The long walk is definitely worth it. Lot of nice point o view."
Beautiful views from the old city walls,"Suwon is easy to get to from Seoul on Line 1 of the metro. At Suwon station pop into the tourist information and they'll give you the info for the bus to the fortress. Once at the city gate walk round the roundabout and you'll see the path leading up to the city walls where you pay the booth, then just get hiking! The first bit is pretty steep with steps but that's the worst bit and the rest if fairly level. It's quite a walk the whole way round but worth it, if you get tired you can stop halfway and walk along the river back to where you started. A nice walk on a sunny day with good views and history."
A significant taste of history in modern Korea,Travelling south on Seoul's metro system your will reach Suwon station. From there a short bus ride will take you to a major gate on the cities former outer wall. After paying a token 1000 won you can explore the walls for as long as you like. The walls and fortifications are in pretty good condition and run for kms . In places there are canons and structures where soldiers would watch for trouble. In most places you can safely walk along the ramparts but if you tire of that there are adjacent pathways. Well worth a visit and even better if you have children. There is plenty to see and it's well worth the effort.
Nice place but takes time to completely tour the area,"We went there expecting an ordinary looking place but to our amazement, the place is very big that it will take long for you to completely cover the whole area. There are rides for touring the whole area so I suggest you get one of those."
Excellent fortress and view from the mini-peak,"Since you can access the fortress by subway anyway from Seoul, it is definitely worth making the approximately one hour journey to this fortress. It was recommended to me by a friend of mine living in South Korea, and it definitely did not disappoint! It costs 3,500 won per person to enter the palace area and the museums (though we didn't go into the museums). The palace area is worth exploring, and you can drink from the spring water there and see what Korean life was like in the 1500s there. After looking around the palace, you should head up to the top of the fortress overlooking the palace and the city. I also recommend walking a short distance away to ring the bell. You can ring the bell three times (once for parents, once for family, and once for yourself) and it costs 1,000 won. Then go back the other way and climb down. You can get a great view of the old wall, and there is a lookout point where you have to remove your shoes, and you can get a good view from there. Since it was early fall, we were able to see some of the trees just changing color and it was quite beautiful. A must-do day trip from Seoul!"
Beautiful on a clear fall day ,What an amazing place to visit. You forget how big and busy the City is that you are in the middle of. The day was cool and clear. Lots of amenities like bathrooms and food options.
Quiet and interesting walk ,Suwon isn’t far from downtown Seoul and it provides a relaxing time combining history and nature (as long as you stay in the western/upper side of the fortress). It is better to bring a guidebook as explanations on the spot are rather limited. Nice for kids. 
"Impressive historic site, be ready to walk a lot","This place is really impressive and very well maintained. It´s a walled city where the wall and all it´s adjacent building remain, but the inner city has been replaced with 20 century buildings. Most of the fortess is located on the hill, between trees (at least in september) most of the town is hidden and you can really make a trip to the past, when this fortress protected the innercity and the Hwaseong Palace. This place was in my top 3 of things to do and was well worth the 1 hour metro ride (don´t be mistaken, Tripdavisor said half an hour but this is not true). Take the blue line (1) or the yellow line (B) to Suwon station. There you look for the Novotel busstop and take busline for about 15 minutes (6 stops) and you are there. I walked the entire walled city and that is easily a 2 -3 hour walk, with many stops along the way, many photo opportunities and just in general a really nice escape from busy Seoul. Make sure to visit the archery site at Yeonmudae, which is a fun stop to practice your bow and arrow skills for only 2USD."
Wonderful Walk,"Spent the day here as part of a group... we had the added bonus of a tour guide which I think was helpful to understand some of the history of the Fortress. It is a UNESCO World Heritage site dating from the Joseon Dynasty-era. Out visit started at the Paldalum and we enjoyed a performance by the Martial Arts Trial group. Interesting show and impressive feats by the artists. We hiked the short but steep trail to Seo Jangdae - (west command post) and Hwaseo-mun gate. The hilltop is not to be missed as it has a wonderful view over the city. We followed the path along the fortress walls - seeing the various gates and appreciating the endurance of the double-walls. The full walk is 5.7km (estimated at 3 hours) though shorter options and a fortress trolly are available. Covering the diverse areas of Suwon with this walk there are a variety of options to get lunch/snacks and drinks. I would recommend water for the walk as it gets quite warm with little option for shade. There is a nice rest spot near the Banghwa Suryu-jeong (North-East pavilion) with a small pond and shade trees. Great for people watching here as well... The Sundae Market near Paldalmun has some small gift shops with handmade trinkets and ice cream/cookies. There is an option to try your hand at archery near the Hwaseong Yeonmudae Post, just 2,000 won for 10 arrows! The Hwaseong Fortress is easy to reach from Suwon Station (exit 4) - maybe a 20-30 minute ride on bus 11, 13, or 13-4 to the Hwaseong Haenggung, Suwon Seongji bus stop. This is a great option for seeing some Korean history without venturing into Seoul or for a quick trip outside of Seoul to see a bit of the ""countryside"". I would recommend to friends, Families, and children would enjoy the tour - just make sure you are prepared to walk!"
Tiring but definitely worth it,We were there in May and it happened to be some spring week so entrance was free. the climb of the stairs can be tiring for people who are not used to it. But the scenery was definitely worth the effort.
Be ready to walk..,"It's a must visit if you're in Seoul. it's not far from the capital city: it is reacheable by metro. The fortress is an impressive structure, a Unesco World heritage.The fortress wall stretches more than 5 km and has a great variety of military facilities. There are 4 gates face each of the cardinal directions.it's a challenging walk, but it is absolutely beautiful!"
Hwaseong Fortress Visit,Excellent place to visit. You get great views of the city and it’s an astonishing mix of old and modern. There’s an small archery class and also a trolley if you don’t feel like doing all the walking. I plan on redoing the trip but running the fortress instead! 
Superb fortress,"Suwon's Hwaseong Fortress protects the south approach to Seoul and was constructed in the 18th century. It is UNESCO World Heritage listed. The walls are over 6km long and can easily be walked along allow 2 - 4 hours to complete the curcuit.. There are several gates, watch towers and observation posts enroute. Access to the walls costs 1000KW."
A must visit place,I would recommend this place to everyone. I was staying in suwon so this was the first place to visit. I went there by bus. Took ticket and started walking inside the fortress. Its a great place learn the history of suwon. And a nice place for hiking as well. From the top of the fortress you can see the suwon city.
Great place to visit! Especially for fans of K-dramas,"Really beautiful place to visit! The highlight of my trip to Korea. If you love Korean Drama, you can visit the palace where they filmed Jewel in the Palace."
Great must-see!,"Absolutely loved this fortress. The lady at the tourist centre next to the train station recommended going to Seojangdae command post first, and follow the walls clockwise from there. I'm glad I followed her advise, because then you start with the steepest part of the walls and go down from there. The views from the wall are great, but make sure to walk outside of the walls too. The golden statue at Daeseungwon temple is definitely worth a look too."
Walking through the wall outside is also recommended,"This is the no.1 landmark of Suwon City and it's must-visit.- Tourists normally stay inside the fortress. But, watching from outside is also nice. I recommend trying Tourist Trolley(Hwaseong Eocha) or walking through the wall.- This is in a huge area. Northwestern part is on Paldalsan Mountain. I think just wall walking including destructed parts takes longer than 6 hours. Take much time and enjoy. I definitely recommend northeastern part(Yeonmudae Area) for tourists who don't have enough time to see them all. Except mountainous areas, Banghwasuryujeong Pavilion(Dongbukporu) is the best place to watch the scenery.- It felt like Suwon Hwaseong Fortress is a minor version of Seoul Fortress(Hanyang Doseong).- Hwaseong Hanggung Palace is in the center. But, there's nothing spectacular since Joseon palaces used to be humble."
Nice way to see the old fortress and to walk through town,Walking along the old walls is a really nice way to see the city in a relaxing way. It’s cheap and nicely kept and you can go on and off the wall where you want for a quick bite to eat etc. 
"Great view of Suwon, amazing at sunrise","I've been to Suwon twice in the last four months, and made the walk/run to Seojangdae, the Western Command Post which is part of the fortress wall, and around part of the wall surrounding the fortress. Wathcing the sunrise is just breathtaking,definitely worth the early wake-up (I use the photos as the background on my office computer). I've also jogged up the hill and around the wall for 2km, then back down thru the fortress along the river walk, and past the south gate (amazing and imposing!) Excellent walking/jogging area, lots of paths and minimal streets to cross. I'll return to the fortress anytime I return to Suwon, still so much to see,"
Impressive,"A beautiful place to visit in all seasons. It is family friendly and easy to access. Part of the wall requires no entry fee whereas a small portion does. I personally love the history and architecture of the various places I visit, and this place has a lot to appreciate regarding both. Wear comfortable clothing as it covers a lot of ground if you wish to see all or most of it. "
Even more stunning at night,"The fortress is an impressive site to see during the day, but at night it is even better. The night lights just shines upon each detail of the wall and the intricate colors of the towers. Never thought to go there at night, but we were happy we did."
"Hawseong Fortress, Suwon","This Fortress, built more than 200 years ago in 1796 built by by King Jeongjo of the Joseon dynasty, houses the King's palace Haenggung. It was designated as a World Heritage site by UNESCO in 1997. The Palace and the defensive Wall which stretches around 5.7 km, are very well kept and maintained.There are also very good information of the history when you stroll and climb up to the defensive walls, these information are well placed at strategic points."
Winter in Hwaseong Fortress,No entrance fee when just walking around the areas of the fortress. Very pretty at night on a snowy winter.
A Fortress of yesteryears,Those fortress of yesteryears are now a fortress of modernisation. Interesting history between Korea and China. After which northern part of Korea was under the Soviets and Chinese while the south was under the Japanese and Americans. These explained the separation. South Korean still bow to show respect just as the Japanese culture and inculcated American English in their English communication. 
A beautiful easy to walk fortress smack bang in the middle of town,"Suwon is an easy to get to city just 45 mins outside of Seoul. We opted to take the regular subway all the way from central Seoul. It was completely worth the trip out! The fortress wraps around the centre of town so it is very easy to navigate and get round. In some of the fortress pagodas you have to take your shoes off before going in. I think during high season there are some places you where there are displays as some sections of the wall was closed when we visited during winter!If you follow the city walls, you can take a circular route hitting all the sites and sounds ending around the market area - where there is a fried chicken street!"
I find it hard to imagine...,"... that someone would come to Korea and not visit this place. While I was walking around I was actually thinking that if I lived in Korea, I wouldn't want to live anywhere else. I pretty much walked around the whole fortress. It has a serious wall. Trump would be crazy jealous if he saw it. I especially like the part with little pond (Yongyeon) outside the wall. By the way, Hwaseong is exclusively restored and maintained. Considering their history and hardships, I think the Korean people should be applauded and have great pride in this achievement."
Beautiful ,"Very nice place and easy to access. On top of that, the entry is free of charge. You can enjoy a walk on the fortress, the complete tour is about 5km.You’ll find there typical Korean architecture and several statues. A must see if you’re around Suwon"
Suwon Fortress,I visited the Suwon Fortress last December. It only took me 30 mins from Seoul station to Suwon via train. The peak of the fortress is worth climbing because you'll see a glimpse of the city. I went around the whole fortress and there are plenty of things to see and good spots for taking pictures.
Slow and peaceful place in suwon,"The place is really peacefull, many coffee shops are located near the paldalmun gate, this is the best place for the healing revreation"
Explore the Fortress,"Hwaseong Fortress is a very interesting place to explore in Suwon. Don't forget to visit the Temporary Palace and Museum when you are visiting there. You can buy packaged ticket for that. There are also many activities you can do around the fortress such as flying kites, trying archery, and eating the famous Korean fried chicken"
An interesting walk and to take in the sights,"We arrived here on a Wednesday morning, which took us quite while using a combination of metro and bus. Admission charges to the site is not expensive, and is not strictly enforced as there are various points you can access the path along the walls.The various gates are majestic, and various structures complement the overall fortress. It is an interesting walk and to take in the sights, and certain parts of are quite a climb. You will be motivated to climb when you see the locals, some elderly, walking and climbing the footpaths with ease.A friendly warning - this place may not be suitable for those with walking difficulties (or the young in prams) as it involves climbing stairs or going upslope. "
fortress wall with small restored fort,Its a long line of wall within the city and have some remains being restored. very near to the Paldamun gate and Paldamun market (local market not mall) of Suwon. I was lucky to see their weekly act where change of guards show and king/queen appear. It gives you good drill view of how actauls may have happned in older times. you should have a couple of hrs to walk on the wall. and couple of hrs more to visit the remaining fort inside the wall. Walking on wall costs 1000 Won and separate charges to go inside. Bicycles are available.
Splendid Fortress of Historic Suwon,"You can see the extensive walls of the past, with its various platforms, command posts, etc. While I didn't walk the complete round with my family, the fortress is magnificent. Be prepared to walk significantly to go round the entire fortress. While I was there in the afternoon, I can imagine it will be a good place to take a evening stroll. From the top of one of the gates uphill, you can have a good view of the current city."
"Spent a half day here, nice walk around ","Would be an idea to plan your trip a little as the fortress is huge and the walk can take a long time. Transport is quite limited in the area (buses) and it may take you some time to get back to where you need.We did this trip with a trip to chicken street for fried chicken. Although it rained, we also got to see some traditional parade which was quite cool.Overall, an ok half day but may be a little boring for some. "
Historical must-see,"We were pressed for time so we took the trolley to take us around the city wall. This is the first place that got me interested in the Joseon Dynasty. A UNESCO World Cultural Heritage Site, it is very rich in history. If and when I go back to South Korea, I would visit this place again and spend more time there."
Only if you have the time to spare for it,"Hwaseong fortress is one of those places that you come across in every country which you can visit if you have time to spare and have seen it all before. By this I mean, it’s pretty far from Seoul’s city centre and therefore will take you quite some time to get to it. But, if you can combine it with something like the “Korean Folk Village” in Yongin, then, the trip starts to make sense.It’s a nice place to take a stroll trough the battlements on a nice weather day, but a definite no on a rainy or snowy day.If you have been to the Great Wall of China, then, this might seem like its little brother. "
Walk the city wall for a fantastic day trip from Seoul,"We visited Suwon as a day trip from Seoul. The train from Seoul station to Suwon is only 30 minutes. Then we got a taxi to Paldalmun, the southern gate of the wall. We walked the wall starting at Paldalmun & going clockwise, so we did the uphill bit through the trees first, getting the hard part out of the way at the start. It took us 2.5 hours to walk the full length, walking moderately quickly with lots of short stops for photos & to look at the sights. We loved the Suwon city wall & would recommend it as a day trip to anyone visiting Seoul. It would be easy to walk a shorter section of the wall, or to only walk the flat, eastern section, for anyone who doesn't have the time or energy for the full walk."
Long long day walk,"A very nice place to visit. Easily 2-3 hours. As we have 5 person in total, so we take bus. Although is cheap but very tough as our first time taking bus in Seoul. We under estimate the walking path and really really tired for a long long walk."
Great half-day visit from Seoul,Take the train to Suwon and explore the remains of the fort walls. At night it is illuminated and provides even nicer views.
Stunning Fortress,"This was a stunning place to visit. I was actually there on a holiday Sunday and the place was a hive of activity. The walk up to the walled fortress was a nice climb up many steps, once on the top there was a beautiful view of Suwon and the wall itself. I didn't walk the whole circular route but dud most of it. It was a great day out. I ate food at the festival area. Was a great day out. Highly recommended."
"History, Culture , City Wall and a Palace Combined With Some Exercise","Located at least an hour drive from Seoul, the Hwaesong offers a massively long city wall, a Palace for a Korean King and a beautiful surrounding cityscape. Read on for details.A wildly popular destination, for locals as well as tourists as we were hugely outnumbered by school tour groups, the Hwaesong Fortress includes a 3+ mile city wall. Walking the wall allows you to see its unique design features as you overlook a varying cityscape and surrounding parks. The interior of the fortress includes a palace with many rooms accessible for viewing, arranged with furniture and attired mannequins in diorama fashion. If you are not going with an informative guide, bring some informative literature as the descriptors by the various aspects of the fortress are minimally informative."
stunning fortress,"This is a very attractive fortress and worth walking along the whole way if you have the time and energy. Bring plenty of water if you do this. When you enter, you are given a sticker to show you paid. Don't lose the sticker-it allows you to enter and exit the place the whole day. It is not as peaceful or attractive as the Gongju fortress due to the surrounding buildings but it is still impressive. The fortress walls are high and strong and the gates are powerful. After hiking the fortress, I recommend exploring the surrounding neighborhood as well which is also enjoyable."
UNESCO World Heritage near Seoul,"This fortress is a UNESCO World Heritage which has nearly 6 Km. length surround the center of Suwon city (the capital city of Gyeonggi Province.) There are 4 main gates that face to the 4 main directions. It's good to walk around the fortress and going up to the peak of the Paldal mountain to see the whole city of Suwon. If you don't want to walk, you can ride the 'Suwon Hwaseong Tourist Tramp'. (It takes around 30-45 mins per 1 round.)"
Historical Place that you can't missed.,There is big place. You must take 2-3hrs. for walk around there. I recommend you walk all places and read history.
Hwaseong fortress and Palace,Hwaseong Fortress is a wall around the city if Suwon. It is about 5.5 km long and has interesting views of the city while you walk the old city wall. It also provides interesting pieces of information about the fortress and the structures that make the wall. Definitely worth a visit if you are in Suwon. The Palace is a beautiful peak into what life looked like for the elite in South Korea in the 18th Century. It is open only until 5:00 pm and costs about 2USD to visit. The fortress and the palace are very close from the suwon station/ak plaza. Taxi would cost about 5USD. Its approx 2 mile walk from Suwon station if you prefer to walk.
Interesting historical site half day trip from Seoul,"An interesting visit not too far from Seoul, it’s located in Suwon. It’s like a mini Great Wall and it’s a great walk on a sunny morning. The fortress is about 5.7km in length with nice view of Suwon and it’s surrounding. Take their tour bus (with a chargeable fee) if you do not want to walk as the route will be the same around the fortress as well."
Lovely walk,Very interesting visiting Suwon and the historic Fortress which was right near our Hotel Dono.Beautiful autumn day walking along the fortress and through the 18th century gates reading about the reason for their construction at a time when the King was to move the Court to Suwon. His death brought change in Seoul and the move never eventuated.
Suwon: Hwaseong Fortress - easy day trip from Seoul,"An easy day trip from Seoul (by subway/light rail is cheapest.)Turn left out of the station where the tourist office provides excellent information and how to catch the W1,300 public bus to Paldalmun to start the tour.It is a very quiet and un-crowded 2-3 hour walk around the walls. I suggest buying the combined ticket for entry to all structures there, including the Palace and museum.Thoroughly recommended!"
Really awesome walled city with a river running through it,"The medieval fortifications surround the entire city and you can walk the entire length of the wall. Each gate offers something unique to see and at any point you can get off the wall to grab a bite to eat or something to drink in one of the neighborhoods bordering the wall. The battlements have all been refurbished, so they, like the wall, are beautiful. Part of the wall climbs a mountain, so expect some sweat there. But, that portion is wooded, so even it’s not too bad. A river runs through the middle of the city, and its worth a walk as well."
This fortress was built to impress ... ,"And it does! It is an UNESCO world heritage site and for good reason, this was an absolute gem! It was a great way to spend a day or a few. You can hike the wall and then take a break and tuck into a local establishment for a bite to eat. It is fun for all ages. I will let my photos do the rest of the talking. "
Lovely hike,"I stopped by the Hwaseong Fortress after my business trip. I started my day at the Paldalmun (South Gate), walked to the Palace, did a free tour with a volunteer guide who works at Samsung, and then took the route from west to east. I went to all four of the main gates. It is definitely worth a visit."
Must Visit on a Trip to Suwon,"A perfect weekend hangout, Hwaseong Fortress presents you with a nice hike around the city with amazing views and a beautiful sunset.You get to see the amazing skyline of Suwon Si.The bell at the top represents such a noble way of faith & trust among the residents :)"
A trip,"I like this place. It's so Korean traditional culture. I can compare it with many same period place in Vietnam, China and Japan. I wish i can come back here next time."
"45min with subway (line1) from Seoul, worthful day trip","Take the walk (beware of the sun) around the fortress, you will feel like a guard in Joseon dynasty. The palace is beautiful. You can take the train to tour a part of the city. A map is very useful to avoid loosing time (tourist office or from internet)."
One of my favourite Korean sites,"Hwaseong fortress can be walked around almost in it's entirety. A pleasant walk with only a few sections with steps, and a wonderful view of the old and new city of Suwon. If the walk is too long, you can catch a tourist train, or local buses."
Worth the hike!,Pros:- day trip from Seoul (roughly 1 hr local train ride per way)- scenic walk (forest and city) either on top of the wall or beside itCons:- requires a bit of an uphill walk for the walls on top of the mountain- requires 4 hrs to walk the entire wall circumference
Take a walk along the walls,"This was one of the highlights of our stay in Suwon, after all how many cities today have an old wall round them. I think it was about a 5 km walk but there are many places to stop including 5 gates, pavilions, the old bell and several statues. If you start from the information shack at the bottom of the hill you will have to climb a few hundred steps to begin with but after that it is not so difficult."
Route March @ Suwon fortress city!,"We took a day trip out from Seoul to northern region of suwon city. Also known as the fortress city as its city surrounded by fortified wall all around it. Travelled by train from Seoul station it like taking a train out from London to Bath to see the Romans bath ruins. Suwon main station is large and extensive. Our first stop was the visitors info centre to get all info needed in local transport and to help us fine tune our day trip itinerary. Got the maps, bus numbers to take and we set off!The weather was hot (summer) but we were in right gear of shots and tees. Here we go. It was a 8km route March all along the fortress wall. It’s on high ground and we can see the entire city built up within. Different sections of the wall had different Color flags to mark the group the soldiers guarding it. It was a good form of exercise too. Take a look at the pics posted for sense of the place and views. Suwon is worth a day trip. Back to the town centre there are the usual mom and pop stores and markers to browse and shop. We ate at a popular deep fried chicken restaurant to reward our selves after the route march!"
sunset,it was Wonderfull to visit this place the moment of sunset. all around the place was so calm and quiet. nice atmosphere and good spot for tourist.
Would Like to Return,"I was tight on schedule and only got to see the outskirts of this fortress but I would definitely like to return and take my time touring around. Just at looking from the outside, it seems they have been maintaining the fortress well so I'm curious as to what is inside too."
Our day trip from Seoul,"From Seoul, the city of Suwon was ideally located for a day trip as there was plenty to occupy our time, but the main reason for our visit was to hike along the old Hwanseong fortress walls. Suwon is easily reached by public transport, we caught the metro down which took roughly one hour. Just outside the entrance to the Suwon Train Station is a tourist information centre which we visited and were given a map of Suwon, the fortress wall as well as a slip of paper with the number of the buses which would take us closer to the fortress (11,13,36 and 39). Instead we walked, taking us around thirty minutes.Once we reached the impressive Paldalmun Gate we turned left up a narrow street to the Paldalmun tourist information office which is also the ticket office where you need to purchase a ticket to walk the walls for 1000 wons. Near the office is a small park with toilet facilities.We have chosen to walk the wall in an anti-clockwise direction, this initial part of the walk to the west gate was the steepest of the climbs for the day, but easily achievable if one goes at a slower and normal pace. It did not take too long to reach a good height to start taking in the lovely views of the city of Suwon. The fortress wall is from the Joseon Dynasty (1392-1910) and has been lovingly restored and maintained ,the wall is 5.52 kms long and the estimated time to walk it in full is 2-3 hours.The wall is well signposted, marking turrets, guard houses, Hyowon's Bell and major gates, there are many places to stop and take a break as needed, photograph the changing views of the city. We encountered very few people on the morning of our hike, all up it took us 1.75 hours with many stops. I don't recall seeing any water fountains so it is best to take your own water and snacks."
Moderately interesting,"My seventeen year old and I decided to take the subway from Seoul to see this city on our 4th and last day in Seoul. It was underwelming and not worth the hour trip. It's a bit neglected and if you've been to any of the palaces in Seoul and the N Tower, you don't need to see this."
An important piece of history,"Much of Hwaseong has been rebuilt but you get a sense of how impressive the fortress was in its day. We started at the North gate and went clockwise. The fortress was built by King Jeongjo who had moved the remains of his father, Prince Sado, nearby. The story of Sado is very haunting as he was killed by order of his father who starved him in a rice casket. My friend explained the flags explain the directions - black for North (turtle), blue for East (dragon), red for South (phoenix) and white for West (tiger). It was a nice stroll and you get views of the city and also important buildings like the palace, training ground, pavilions etc. After lunch we went from the South to the West and that was the steepest bit of the climb - a bit challenging in the summer heat. A must-visit as you feel the sense of history. Allow for most of a day to walk the entire circuit of the fortress and visit the palace. Would love to return when next in Seoul. "
beautiful place to be at,Beautiful and well maintained. Have all kind of ammeneties for a family with small children. If you looking for a day to relax and enjoy. You must have a look
"Good daytrip from Seoul, full of history and great views","About an hour from Seoul, this is a good trip option. The fortress takes a good long walk to go around if you want to hit all the gates, and there are great spots for photos."
Unesco heritage site,"This fortress was built by the 22nd king of joesan dynasty and parts of it were destroyed during the japanese invasion and korean war. It was restored and now one of the unesco world heritage city. The fortress is magnificent and picture worthy. Best to go with a guide or read up before going to appreciate the site more. After visiting this fortress, you should visit the ‘moving palace’ which is nearby. Pls wear a hat/cap/ sunglasses and sunblock if you are visiting during this time of the year. "
Magnificent Fortess,It was a hot day. Worth the visit but no shade to cover when is hot. Being witness a piece of history. 
Very interesting tour,We had a 1/2 day tour of the Fortress. Weather is generally somewhat cooler here than Seoul. We walked all around the fortress walls. Houses inside the fortress walls are all a more traditional style than those outside the fortress walls. Liked seeing a couple of the “secret” doors for bringing in supples and people. Differing flag colors around the top of the walls were used to designate the four directions. About a 25 minute exhibition with actors to showcase military prowess of the Jueon Dynasty.
Top attraction near Seoul ,"This is a crown attraction of suwon, and possible one of the top in Korea. I arrived in perfect weather, not too hot to do all the walking and little climbing The Fortress is well preserved, with explanation signs in English as well The surrounding forest and gardens are beautiful If you walk all the way its 5-6 kilometers There are many pavilions on the wall where you can take rest and shade from the sun If you like to know more about the history of this place, you can take a private tour guide near janganmun gate I arrived with bus 3000 from Seoul, which drops you near the janganmun gate, it took around 40 minutes ride on weekend "
Nice walk,"The fortress walls surround a reasonable sized modern town, intermingled with other historical sites. I didn’t visit the other sight but enjoyed the walk around the north and east half of the walls. Views are pleasant if urban. Some nice grass areas and odd cafe along the way. Certainly worth a few hours of your time if you need somewhere to stretch your legs: very cheap to get into for what is a UNESCO site."
A revelation ,"This is a wonderful fortress, though we believe heavily restored in modern times.You can walk around the walls, recommended of you have the time, or take the tourist buses around, less recommended "
Unique to the history of Suwon,Had the privilege of checking out Hwaseong Fortress today. Truly wonderful place. Very well kept. The walls of the fortress immaculately preserved. Very useful signage giving us relevant info and history about different sections of the fortress. Very scenic. Very easy to get to. A must see and must do when in Suwon City.
a sight to behold,always wanted to come here. it is really an amazing walk up and around the fortress. do visit the small palace within as well.
Amazing free hike along the only walled city fortress in Korea,"I am so glad to have taken this half-day opportunity to hike along the only walled city fortress in Korea. The scenery is so beautiful on this sunny spring day. Definitely bring your comfortable walking/hiking shoes, quite a bit of steep steps to the top."
Beautifully preserved,"This is a lovely place to visit as it is well laid out, preserved and clean.There is lots to see and there are many displays that depict how life was at the time."
UNESCO World Heritage,Really nice view and it goes all over the city. It will not take too much of your time as seeing it completely is difficult. Take a few snaps and go to the Haenggung Palace. 
A scenic walk,It is a scenic walk. On the top you get a nice overview of the city. Do not forget your walking shoes.
Good any time of year.,"Hwaseong is our favorite historical fortress or palace to visit. There are museums, reataurants, arts and craft areas, and boutiques that offer experiences you are unlikely to find at other sites. It is also a wonderful place to take a walk or jog. You could easily spend the better part of a day in the area. If you want to take the guided train tour though, you need to go early. Also, the parking lots fill up fast. We usually park at the governmemt comlex or the museum area. It is a huge area, so wear something comfortable."
Outdoor exercises ,Good place for a scenic walk. Places along the trail to stop and rest. Mostly flat walking but some hills and steps but option to avoid steps and hills avilable. I would return again. I visited in Jan so 42 degrees with mild wind and sunny. 
Best thing what I saw in South Korea!,"So I did 15 days of travel around South Korea and this attraction was the best I saw. It is far for mine train station, so I recommend to take bus to there. You can enter in territory from 4 sides though gates. I chose gates on the east side. At first I went to have coffee there (have lovely coffee place) and after that I went to information stand, where I met the most wonderful people what worked there. So go to meet them. So friendly, good English, even asked me to join for lunch.. They explained me that hike should take approximately 3-4 hours. I did it in 2,5 hours. So the goal is to walk hole cycle around gates. I paid 2 EUR for entering (1500 won). It was just so quiet there and calm, the view was amazing. Just be aware that it is not easy hike, so wear sth comfy, but you can quit any time. In the middle of the fortress is old town and market place. You can enter to area where is transnational dances, but it costs extra. After rush in Seoul, I think this was the best place to be, felt so relaxed. But wanted to mention that I really dont recommend staying night at Suwon, just go there for the day. I stayed in city for two nights and dint felt safe at all. Just a lot of drunk people. But beside that, this was the best thing what I saw, so very happy that I went."
Catch a glimpse of Korea’s past,Take the metro out from central Seoul and then a short walk/taxi ride to the fortress entrance and walk around the palace and grounds
Traditional Market,"Traditional Market has seafood, lots of kimchi and other ingredients. Also has some of Street food. "
Not bad - ready first,"This is not a bad place, but if you are limited on time in Seoul, you can skip it. We spent about 1 hr there."
jinan's home meal + Hwaseong tour,"it was very special experience. Hwaseong tour with native Koreanwe went his home, ate samgyeobsal. I experienced native korean culture:)"
August 2014,My husband and I went on the Die in your bus to see this place. It was a fantastic tour but the tour guide's English was difficult to understand.I also wish we could have had more time here. I recommend it anyways.
Beautiful scenery from the top,We arrived late in the evening but was still able to spend some time inside the palace. We made our way up to the mountain. The scenery of the night skyline of Suwon was beautiful and worth the climb up. Wouldn’t recommend the climb up if u are with senior and carrying infants. It could get tiresome. We climbed down along the wall and made our way back to the night market. 
Blend of traditional and modern,"Designated as a world heritage site for its originality and superiority, this is a top tourist attraction in Korea. You can travel along the fortress walls on Hwaseong Train. Bike rentals are also available.The integrated pass is more affordable"
Great bit out outdoor space,"I love this place, and not just because my wife and I had our first date there! It is an amazing green space in Suwon. Any day you have blue skies, you definitely should go for a hike here!"
Great walk,"Obviously, this is *the* thing to do and see in Suwon. The wall has been restored nicely and offers a great 6 km walk. Most of it pretty flat, but the Western side goes over the top of the hill and that is a short but steep rise with a slow descend (coming from the East, and vice versa when coming from the North). Lots of interesting history to experience and read. Price: only 1000 or 1500 Won, so very affordable (but don't throw away your receipt and sticker as there are a few checkpoints underway)."
"Combined with the palace tour, a great day out","We walked about 5km around the fortress wall, walking from the Hwaseong Palace up to the Seojangdae command post, then clockwise round to the Paldalmun gate (we skipped the bit from the Paldalmun gate to Seojangdae), From the Hwaseomun gate to the Janganmum gate we walked outside the wall, which gave a very different persepective of the size of the wall compared to walking on top of the wall. There is a motorised tour (called the Trolley) around part of the fortress walls for those who do not walk."
An impressive insight of the ancient Korean history ,Its a UNESCO heritage site.Greeneries everwhere.Korean ancient architecture and breataking view of the surroundings once you reach at the top of the hill.A must go place if you are around Dongtan or Suwon
Beautiful,Very well maintained fortress wall with amenities well spaced for access to water/drinks and toilets. Beautiful
Enjoyable walk around the fortress walls,"My son and I had walked the fortresses in Ganghwa and Seoul the previous year, and were looking forward to hiking along the walls of Suwon Fort. Suwon fotress is the only remaining walled city in Korea. The walls were badly damaged in the Korean War, and there was extensive repair done, so the walls do not have an ancient weathered appearance. The fortress is beautiful, and we enjoyed our hike around which took a little less than three (3) hours.We started hiking early in the morning, and there were many locals exercising on the paths next to the wall. Our starting point was the South gate (Palsalmun), and our plan was to walk in an anti-clockwise direction. The most difficult section of the wall, is the hilly section between the Southern and the Western gate (Hwaseomun). There are many directional signboards along the walk, and not many bathrooms, which are usually located near to the tourist information centers. Please carry any water bottles or other waste with you until you are off the wall, as I do not remember seeing any waste receptacles.It takes approx. 15 minutes to hike to the first landmark, which is the southwestern secret gate and sentry gate. The path takes a turn to the left where the sentry post offers views of the city below.Almost immediately opposite this area are the independence monuments which commemorate Korean independence from Japan colonialism at the end of World War 2. The next major landmark is the Suwon Bell which is rung every hour between 10am and 6pm. Visitors may pay W1,000 each to ring the bell.If the path leading down to the right of the bell is taken, after a short walk you will reach an asphalted path. Go across the path, and down the steps and the Sungshinsa Temple with the huge golden budha will come into view. It is possible to enter the small temple which is underneath the statue.We then had to climb the steep path back up towards the Bell to continue our hike.The next landmark is the Western gate, which is a pleasant downhill stroll, and the end of the hilly section of the wall. Just before completing the downhill walk, to the immediate right there is a recreation of the tools that were used in building the fortress, and signage explaining how they were used.If you take a short walk on the road opposite the West gate, take a right,walk uphill, then a left, and you will be in a small park, and facing the huge statue of King Jeongjo. There are steps behind the statue, which you may climb to get a better photo.The next landmark is the Northern (Janganmun) Gate, where there are a few cannons. The northern flood gate, which is probably the most photographed gate will be passed next.The Eastern Command Post is next, and there are a few historical items on display here to your left after walking through the main gates.To the rear of the command post are a few small cannons, and samples of rocks that would have been used as catapults to defend the fortress.The archery area will be in view in the large open field below the command post.The Eastern gate (Changnyongmun) is the next landmark. If you walk through these gates, and to the right a hot air balloon should be in view. This is a great way to see the fortress and Suwon city, and I regret missing this, as we did not have enough time. The Suwon Church, with it's gothic appearance makes for a great photo amidst the ancient structures on the wall. The smoke signal structure is the last major landmark. After walking over the southern flood gate, you will be back at the start of the hike at the South Gate. We found the walk to be pleasant, and should not be a problem if you are relatively fit. There is a trolley between the Bell and Archery section if you do not want to walk the length of the wall. It should be noted that there are three (3) areas along the wall which a ticket can be purchased to walk the wall.We had almost completed our walk by the time we reached the last ticket office, which opened at 9am. We found the cost of W1,000 each to be very reasonable."
It is so long......but intersting,"I visited Hwaseong Fortress two times, once it October and once in January. In October it was so beautiful and you could see so many flowers. In January it was good but cold....just a bit ....... it was good for walking."
"Beautiful and historic, be prepared to walk","We saw this on Trip Advisor and had an afternoon/evening to kill. We started by doing a short archery lesson which you had to buy tickets to participate in but it was fairly cheap, maybe a couple thousand won per person. Our 8-year-old was able to do it and the whole family had a lot of fun. The woman teaching it was wonderful. We then walked around looking at the beautiful structures and followed the wall around. There are a lot of locals walking dogs or taking an evening stroll. Saw some people flying some pretty impressive kites. Not a lot of tourists when we were there but that is not a problem for me. I kept marveling at Daeseungwon Temple in the distance. It is beautiful, especially as it starts to get near dusk and the golden statue really tends to glow. We drove here and ended up walking a long way, not sure how far but we ended up near a local market where you can shop and eat. We then made our way back to the car. We were tired and walked out by then. We spent a good few hours there and could have spent more. We saw only a small portion of the wall. Be sure to bring sunscreen and a hat depending on time of day you go. Comfortable shoes are a must. Our whole family really liked this beautiful, historic place."
Beautiful at night!,"We had planned to go here when the sun was still out, but for several reasons we ended up going at night, which turned out to be perfect! The walls were beautifully lit, and there was a hot air balloon that was also lit up so it was a magnificent view against the night sky. The walk was not bad as the weather was cool. It was amazing to see how far the walls went around the city because of the lights. This is a great place to visit if you like learning about history or even if you just want to see an architectural beauty. The only thing I wished I was able to do was the archery. We were able to see the area where they did it, but it was already closed due to the late hours."
Nice Day Trip,"We were visiting Seoul, but our Korean friend is from Suwon and he was eager to show us his hometown. We spent the main part of our day at the fort. We were there on a weekend (when he had time off work) and it was fairly busy in some of the areas of the wall, mostly where I think parking/bathrooms/snacks are, and we mostly had the rest of it to ourselves. Originally he was going to bring us up on the silly train thing (mostly for kids I think, but we were just gonna do it for fun) which I think brings you to one of the main areas of the wall, but there was huge kids' event going on and the little train was booked up. So we just ended up walking pretty much the entire wall. Being from the area, he gave us a bit of a tour as we walked. There are also a few little covered areas along the wall, and we stopped in one for awhile to cool off and have a little picnic. Please note there is nowhere to throw your trash out along the wall, you will need to carry it with you in a plastic bag until you get somewhere to toss it out.If you decide to do the whole thing (which we didn't plan on, but did anyways), I would suggest going in the morning or evening when it's a bit cooler. Also, bring lots of sunscreen and hat if you can, as you will mostly be exposed to sun the whole time, aside from the occasional little covered area (which usually have other people in them and might not have room to sit in)."
Historical Place,"Good information about Korean culture, kings and royal families.must see family place to know about ancient korea."
A must see!,"A must see when travelling in South Korea, travelling by bus or subway. Subway stop about 20min walk to Fortress but you can get a bus. Small fee for access and the market after doing the hike around the fortress was great to visit."
Great day trip to Suwon from Seoul,"Take bus 11 13 36 or 39 from the Suwon train station and alight at the massive and striking Palduman Gate. The visitors centre is located on the western side where you get a map and buy your combination ticket. We arrived from Seoul on a day trip at 0800 and enjoyed walking the wall visiting each gate, some which commanded great views. The walk was OK albeit slow and steep in a couple of places, but these two old ducks and their knees made it. We finished around 1600 and headed back. A great day out.Thanks for the vote if you found this review helpful."
Be ready for stairs climbing,"Took a bus from Seoul to here. The admission was free because of certain festival (can't remember). It's a steep walk uphill from the entrance at Padalmun Gate. The fortress was magnificent. Had a nice walk here.Outside the fortress, there's a lot of student group with their teacher having picnic. From kindergarten till teenager. Also there was a group of people had traditional dance practice."
Great Hike to the Top!,This is a great cultural experience that is not to be missed. Hike to the pavilion at the top for a great view of downtown Suwon!
Walk around fortifications,"It is reachable by public transportation, you need to take the subway then a bus during more than one hour. However it is worth walking around. You can take some nice pictures from the fortress."
A place to visit if you are in Suwone,"This is a UNESCO Heritage site. When I first took interest in visiting this site, I did not realize it would involve lots of walking and occasionally climbing. Be warned if you want to walk the walls you would likely need to be fit and have a good walking shoes. The walk stretches a vast area and end back up to almost the same spot. I started from the west wall which is not pave as well as the east wall. The total time I took is 3 hours which is pretty short as far as what I found. If you preserve, the journey is well worth it.There are exit points along the way if you decide not to continue. Well written signage tells the history and stopping to read it do help put colors to the places we stopped. Overall a must if you are in Suwon."
Boring...,It's worth seeing...but we spent an hour walking around then left. It gets repetitive and there's an actual town inside now. There's not much to see and it gets boring. 
11:00 AM.,Throughly enjoyed the trip around the Fortress but the icing on the cake was a display of period marshal arts at the front of the Fortress at 11:00 am but not Monday's but please check.
A nice walk,A nice walk along the restored fortress from the eighteen century which got the recognition from Unesco as a world caltural heritage sight. 
A beautiful part of South Korea,"This fortress is like nothing you have seen before. It extends around the entire city with many different buildings and entrances. The views from the top are amazing so its great for photography. Be warned, the first initial climb can be quite taxing but there are plenty of places to take a break. Take a packed lunch with you and plenty of water. relax at the top with a camera and take in the view.Very easy to get to Suwon from Seoul."
Really Nice Walking Area,"This was worthwhile to go to Suwon to see. Large, vast open spaces and a nice path along the fort walls to walk upon. We did not have much time here since we were on a excursion arranged by the cruise ship. Luckily we had good weather (no rain) to visit. It was not very busy which made it much nicer."
Great light-trail course!,"It was fantastic! I could see the whole area inside the fortress on the posts, pavillions, and gates. I hiked along the fortress facing cool breeze under blue sky. I was informed the whole path takes about three hours and is 5.7 km. But it took for me to hike a half course about three hours. I enjoyed the scenery sitting in a wooden floor at gates. I was great! I would go again at day and night."
wide open space,"Really not much to see inside the fort walls. Climb to the top of the hill to walk along the ramparts inside the wall, peak out the archer slits to view the town. In the large field inside the walls people can pay 2000KRW (about $2 US) for 10 arrows & try their archery skills. We were there on a Saturday & lots of kids were enjoying archery."
Nice walk,"Nice walk in Suwon that offers a kind of smaller version of the Chinese wall, it gives nice view over Suwon and is much quieter than the rest of the city."
Fantastic few hours on half day trip from Seoul,"Zipped off down to Suwon in the morning and was back in Seoul by 3pm having walked the entire fortress wall, rung the bell, tested my skill at archery and wandered the palace.I agree with others comments about getting there 9 or 930 ish to start. Recommend heading up the steep part first which is to your left down the side street near burger king as you face Padalmun gate.I was staying near Seoul station so i opted for a 'regular' train rather than the subway train as i got an assigned seat, took only 35 minutes and cost 2700krw. The subway takes just over 1hr and is 2050 krw (i took that back to Seoul but wished i hadn't. After walking all morning then having to stand up on that subway for an hour... Should have paid 10k and taken a ktx!!)From Suwon station you can come outside and get on a bus from the stop on the left (follow signs to tourist information,the buses stop just past there). You can take bus 11, 13, 36, or 39. The fare was 1300krw. Can't vouch for all buses add i only took 2 but both of them announced the stops which made it super easy. (Basically get off when the bus stops in front of a big big gate as seen in the photos!)You can get the same bus numbers back from opposite where you get dropped off, near the street that takes you to the steep climb of the wall. Go inside and outside the wall to get pictures from both angles as you go along. And make sure you try the archery! Only 2000krw!"
Beautiful landscape and easy to walk,We took our family of five including a five-year-old child and we had a wonderful day walking around the Fortress. The complete complex is very easy to walk around we found parking easily by the entrance near the palace it only cost us 2000 won to park. I suggest getting there first thing in the morning like it 9 930 and walking the complete complex you could spend a whole day there easily having a picnic. They do have clean restrooms and they have places to eat inside the Fortress like a convenience store that sold soft drinks and coffee and beer and snacks and souvenirs. I extremely highly recommend this as a day trip for anyone who wants to get outside and spend some time in a beautiful place that is not crowded but offers convenience. I suggest taking extra batteries for your cameras and your phones there are so many different picture opportunities it's just truly amazing. 
Catch the tourist train for a lovely ride around the whole site.,Nice way to spend an hour or so if you catch the little train. The whole site is quite large and spread out.
Romantic walk along the wall and kite flying,Great date spot for an afternoon. We started at the gate and culture centre and walked all the way to the fortress where we could buy a cheap kite and catch some nice winds. Worth the visit to Suwon.
"Very nice, but not as much as Namhansanseong","A very pleasant hike with some nice views, but little additional info provided. Subway + bus took a total of some 70 minutes from downtown Seoul. Very worth seing, but if you have time to see only Hwaseong OR Namhansanseong (the other unesco listed fortress in the area - bus no 9-1 from Sanseong metro station), most definitely go to the latter."
Impressive and very well taken care of,Impressive big and has been repaired presumably being anstructure built in 1778 i think. The walk was very good as it was covered properly. The view from above is very nice. Stairs are appropriate distance for people with some disabilities. Wow the nearby archery is very impressive as it allows disabled people and seniors to try. 
Enchantment in the city,"The Hwaseong fortress is a must see attraction if visiting Suwon. It can be easily accessed via a short bus trip from Suwon station too. Hiking to the top is a must, even if you don't have time to fully explore the entire length (which can take several hours). Sadly, I had only 45 minutes due to other commitments but I was still able to hike to the top, explore some of the fortress wall and gates, as well as take in views of the surrounding city. Well worth it. Next time I will allow half a day to explore."
The path to wonderland ,"Such a enchanting place when cherry blossoms are in bloom you feel like your in another world. There a giant bell you can ring for less than 5,000₩. Parts of the wall have real battle damage to them. "
Weekend trip,Suwon is the best place ever. I took the bus and the subway to get there from Osan AB. I walked around the wall and also toured the musuem there. I ate and the food was good. Please go there. It is a not to be missed place.
Great visit outside Seoul,"For this type of area we had to take a personal one full day tour which is actually not expensive is about $50 per person including the lunch, but you do need guide since is far from the main areas and it is worth the visit. It was actually very cold the day we arrived but we made sure we were warm enough. It is beautiful you get the most pretty pictures ever. Our guide schedule a trolley ride because the walk is really long. Once in the trolley you take your own earphones and listen to the description in english about this fortress. If you have time take a chance and visit this place is worth it."
A challenging place,This place requires a lot of physical activity as it is mostly uphill and a bit of downhill. It's long a walk if you intend to walk the whole wall and can be quite exhausting after some bit.
"Great Place to Visit, Walk, Relax","Hwaseong Fortress is located about 15 minutes by bus away from Suwon Station. It's about 4-5 miles long and has great views of Suwon City. There are trolley's that you can ride but I prefer the hike. However, make sure you've got comfortable shoes for all of the steps."
Great hike around the walls,"This was a lovely walk. We had hiked the northern walls of Seoul but Suwon is better. The hike is easier in distance and exertion but most importantly it is more visually striking. From many locations you can see long sweeps of the wall and distant gates and sections. It is much easier to grasp the scale and intent. Large sections are treated as park land and well maintained and planted. Overall, a delight. "
Nice for a day trip,Hwaseong Fortress is a good thing for a day trip. Either with kids or without. Would recommend to go only during nice weather. Sometimes you can see a lot of locals with paperdragons etc. Nice to walk on the wall around the area.
Quite a challenging hike along the fortress wall,"Took the blue Line 1 subway from City Hall station to Suwon station ( 1.5 hours ). Although the announcement at City Hall station was that the train was going to Sinchang, when we were approaching Guro station, there was an announcement that those heading towards Sinchang had to transfer at Guro. ( The train we were on was heading towards Incheon ) From Suwon station we took Bus 11 ( 13, 36 & 39 also go ) to Paldalmun gate situated in a roundabout ( 15 mins KRW 1 100 using T Money card ) After getting our Hwaseong Fortress tickets ( KRW 1 000 for adults ) we had to walk up a steep 40 degrees slope ( 50 m ) followed by 300 + steps. Those with mobility issues can take the sight-seeing train."
Best place in Suwon to get away form hustle and bustle,"Nice place to go for a walk - to circle the whole 3.7 mile wall takes about 3 hours. Wear warm clothes in winter and good walking shoes. There is a staircase with about 300 steps , so don't attempt the whole route unless you're ready for it. It's nice to see the city surrounding the fortress, and there are several opportunities to go outside and walk through neighborhoods, markets, places for lunch, etc. If you have some free time it is a good place to slow down a bit. - I really didn't find much else in the 'tourist' category in the Suwon area."
Place to visit to see Korea,"Hwaseong is built by King Jeonjo for multi purpose. It is for battle castle as well as memorable palace for father of king Jeonjo, Sadoseja, who died at wooden rice chest from the farther king Youngjo. Once you visit Hawseong, you must visit museum and you will know more history.All the walls of castle are connected now and if you like to have a full round walk on the top of the wall, it takes around 3 hours including mountain-like course about 30 min. You also have one of the famous place Korean folk village, Minsokchon, 45 min by public transportation, so I recommend stay one night in Suwon to visit both place. And there is famous Suwon Galbi restaurants as well in Suwon. If you want to have Galbi in Seoul, Suwon is the place to eat. Most of Suwon galbi restaurant have US, Australia, Korea beef. My recommendation is to have no Korean (US either Australian)beef (cost effective) with marinated. It is cheaper than Korean beef.Enjoy ! "
Amazing construction,"Its hard to believe that this fortress is still standing after all this time. It is a steep walk up the steps. We also did the archery, which was lots of fun. It was hard to get to the archery place so i would look into how to get there if you are interested in it. An easy day trip from Seoul. We took one of the train lines with the reserved seats, which made it a comfortable journey."
Great walk,"This place is very good escape from the busy metro life of Seoul. Since the fortress demands walking, it's best NOT to go there during summer season. Well there's a train-like vehicle that you can ride to tour you around but it's best to do some walking to appreciate the place. We went there during Autumn season and it was very nice. Take a picture of the guards wearing traditional uniforms. They're mostly elders and very friendly. And try the classic archery at the end of the walk. You can also feast from the local food being sold in their market just outside the fortress."
Walk around the fortress,"I spend half day in the fortress. I arrive at Suwon at noon, then go here and walk around. First, I went to Haenggung Palace. Then walk from Paldalmun Gate to Janganmun Gate.. The weather is nice, not too hot and not too cold. I came here at winter and really enjoy walking around. If you like to walk and hike, then I suggest to walk from one gate to another gate while enjoy the scene. Especially those who like historical place. Use the map, and you can know the name of some building. It's very interesting."
Great afternoon hike,"The Hwaseong Fortress is a must see. There are a few fortresses in Korea but this fortress is well maintained and with nice flourishes like flags and on the weekends and holidays, actors in costume round out your photographic experience. Several of the information plaques are in English but I recommend getting a guide or a really good guidebook. There is so much to see and if you are unaware, you'll miss out on a lot of the rich history of this fortress."
Do NOT go during summer,"Had a great time at Hwaseong Fortress, though if you're not into walking I can see this being a bit of a bore to some.Also, do not make the mistake I did of going during the summer. It gets incredibly hot and cold water seems to just vanish within the first hour.Do yourself a favor and visit during spring or fall when the weather isn't so hot and humid."
South Korea Great Fortress @ Mini Great Wall of China,"It was a good long walk on this Hwaseong Fortress. We were brought by our private tour guide that we hired to this historical place.it was designated a UNESCO World Cultural Heritage Site and the wall is still strong and firm. Double layers of wall to ensure the enemies will not be able to attack them during war time. A brilliant construction and still siting there firmly. Hwaseong Fortress surrounded this city and protecting it until today. Hwaseong Fortress is an impressive structure from the latter part of the Joseon Dynasty (1392-1910). The fortress wall was built using Seokjae and Jeondol (bricks) and the holes between the bricks are just big enough to fire guns, arrows, or long spears through in case of an attack. You will also see whether that is the outside or inside of where you stand. Confuse? Go and explore with this special built up for so many centuries ago. Remember to drop by Uncle Coffee at Goyang-si, Gyeonggi-do for a cup of good coffee like what we did. My mom and I really enjoy it and hope you too!Enjoy and get hold of every scene!"
Great day trip historical visit,"A must see for first timers in Korea. It's just an hour or so travel outside of Seoul. This is good for a day trip since you will be walking and enjoying the view of nature and Korean history and the great view of Suwon province. The air smells fresh and clean. Since it was autumn when we went, it was relaxing to walk."
Heritage,This fortress is a heritage of Choseon Dynasty. It is pretty big compared to other heritages that are in Seoul. A lot of history tales are involved so you can have better view if you know some of them.
City Trip,A must place visit if you live while visiting South Korea. You can either walk or use the trolley. Enjoy it!
Nice place to re-live old Korea,Good to stroll along the fortress and re-live the old Korean. Good that it has been restored from all the wars in Korea
Detailed directions here. ,"This World Heritage Site is well worth a visit, but the directions I found on a different site were incorrect, so here's what I did today (twenty-eighth of December). Take subway line one all the way to Suwon (takes at least thirty-five minutes from Seoul station). Then follow the signs for the tourist info center, where you can get a free map. Outside the centre and to the left is where the buses leave from. You can take buses １１,１３,３６ or ３９ to Paldaimun (easy to spot, it's the big gate in the middle of the roundabout). It's only a five minute journey on the bus. Once you get to the gate, it's very easy to find the walls to either side. The steps can be steep at times, so be sure to bring a drink with you. There are free public toilets at the bottom of the wall to the left of the gate. I hope this makes someone's visit much smoother! "
Fortress wall with a fantastic view,"This underrated attraction is just about an hour from Seoul and a good day trip. The view from the top of the fortress wall is fantastic. We went on a weekday with hardly a crowd in sight. Consider buying the combined ticket which allows admission to the fortress wall, palace, museum and another attraction."
Nice visit,Nice place to visit while in Suwon. Beautiful world heritage site in the middle of the city of Suwon.
Spectacular scene of fortress,nice big rock at the entrance. You need to take a few hundred stairs/steps to walk from one end to the other. Spectacular views!
Wonderful Site and Huge!,"This is a tremendous site and spectacular sight! The walls extend for around 6km. Unfortunately time did not allow for the full circuit, but you can get good views and experience the walls defensive capabilities from walking just a part. See the walls four gates, artillery towers, archery turrets and guardhouses along the way. Part of the city has grown up within the walls and it is interesting to see the old and new juxtaposed.The walls were originally created at the end of the 18th century to surround the tomb of King Jeongjo's father.Near the information office there is an archery school and it is fun to see people having a go. No wonder South Korea excels at archery in the Olympics!"
Fortress,"Amazing place! I live in Seoul, been to Busan, Daegu and Jeju but this fortress is Top-20 attraction is all Korea unarguably! So much history. Surrounds the city, great for pictures, a small hike. Entrance fee is 1,000 KRW which is great. There are bikes for rental too at very cheap prices."
Second Time Visiting Here,Very interesting piece of history-lots to see here. We walked to top obervation lookout (about 500 steps) well worth it for the views and photo ops. Check out what happened to Prince Sado!
"Great place, less tourist, huge area, well protected","It is a huge place, you need basic fitness here. The wall is very interesting. I walked the entire wall and mostly by myself. I spent a day to relax and look around. Very nice day out from Seoul. There is a archery club inside the wall.Suwon is easily reach from Seoul by train, then 30 minutes walk to the wall. A lot of lookouts along the wall, you can sit, relax, even take a nap (as I saw someone did), enjoy the view with cool breeze..."
Keep Hwaseong Fortress in my memory!!!,Hwaseong Fortress is one of the world cultural heritage of South Korea. beautiful and interesting place. I recommended to came here during sunset because it was the best time for relaxing with excellent atmosphere and nice weather. Around the fortress there are shops selling souvenirs and they are available for archery service as well. I thought here suitable for talking a photo and chill out !!!
For only 1000 yuan this cannot be beat,I spent the day here after arriving on the train. It took 20 minutes to walk here and 3.5 hours to walk the wall. It is beautiful. There is so much culture and the views are wonderful. There are plenty of places to exit the wall to get a drink or eat and you pass through a very nice Korean market. They have a trolly that drives around and drops you off if you don't want to walk the whole way. There are stairs and plenty of steep hikes so you do have to be in decent shape if you want to walk it quickly. Otherwise take your time and take a few breaks. Take your shoes off and sit in one of the lookouts and see the city. This isn't the Great Wall of China but it is here and I would say it is nearly as nice. 
Enlightling,"Our two day stay in Suwon only allowed us a limited time for attraction, and found the Hwaseong Fortress well worth the time to visit. Not only does the Fortress have historical significance, it’s also used on a daily basis by the local community for outdoor walking activity. It’s a historical artifact located and used by the city on a daily basis. History comes alive here and is celebrated by the locals"
Veery Interestring,"We walked up and down a lot of this magnificent structure, admiring the views of the city, and the architecture of the wall and fortress itself.THIS IS A FUN ACTIVITY!"
Big fort ,Fort is the most attractive point of suwon city. You can see full city view and architecture of Korean civilization. It is covered with local markets and famous donuts shop.
Korea's Almost Capital,"Very interesting history! A great way to spend a fall day. With almost 6km of walls to walk over steep hills, you certainly get some exercise. The signs are in English as well as Korean, Chinese, and Japanese, so it's easy to navigate. The only challenge is the small section of wall that was not repaired after the Korean War, but it's not too challenging to find the next section to continue the walk around the city. "
Stunning,A real little find while in South Korea; we walked along the wall which gave us some great views of the city as well as the rest of the twisting fortress wall. The history is also very interesting and to walk along on a nice bright sunny day is incredibly enjoyable!
Partly rebuilt fortress from the 1700s,The site offers wide open views not common in a city of high-rise buildings. A nice escape from an otherwise very busy place. Worth a visit. 
Walk up and around the fortress,"If walking is preferred, it will take about twenty minutes from Suwon Station. Directions to the place are aided by the fortress symbol on overhead street-signs and additional tips provided by helpful locals and if non-English-speaking, like those encountered in the trip, will still assist through mime. The summer heat will bring some discomfort but upon reaching the site, it is a well-earned sight to explore. Climb the steps and get inside to enjoy the well-maintained linear park within the walls. At designated areas are several watchtowers to view cityscapes. With these, the traditional and the contemporary are combined."
Amazing spot,Visited with some friends one evening. The signs indicate it is free after 6pm. Easy to find from all parts of suwon. Pictures from the western command post of the sunset are stunning! About 5km round trip but you can get on and off anytime. A must see if you have time! 
Definitely worth it!,"We didn't walk the whole perimeter (it was too hot) so we started at Yeonmundae and did the archery (KRW2000 for ten arrows) - it was so much fun! From there we boarded the trolley (KRW 1500 each) and got off near the Hyowon's Bell. It's a steep walk uphill to toll the bell but so worth it! (KRW 2000 for two people).Afterwards we walked down to the Gongbang Arts and Crafts Street to get a cold drink - there are some lovely quirky cafes. Personally, I prefer the range of souvenirs sold here to Insadong as so many are handmade and unique pieces unlike what you get in many Insadong shops."
Fortress,It is good for a 2 or 3 hr trip but always combine with other activities in the area such as a visit to Golden Buda or archery at the fortress. Sounding the bell is around $5 and uou get 3 turns (closes at 5pm). Hike to temple is like a 10 to 15 min stair climb. Wear comfy/sporty clothes. 
Huge Palace,Huge palace situated at the center of city. You can enjoy train ride there. It is very huge and natural. It needs 3-4 hours to visit. Entry fees is less around 1000 won.
The Fortress as an UNESCO World Heritage,"The circumference of the fortress is 5.7km. The fortress walls remain intact almost as the original form as it was constructed 200 years ago.Flat and mountainous fortress, which cannot be found in other neighboring countries like China and Japan. It was constructed for dual functions ― military defense and commercial functions. With its scientific, rational, and practical structures, it can be called the finest among the fortresses in AsiaWalking around the fortress, you can see various posts, pavilions, gates"
Going in through a rabbit hole,"I visited the fortress alone from Suwon Station and got lost because I got off from the bus earlier than it should be. I got off at Paldalmun Market, I walked a while and found a ""rabbit hole"" to go to the inside of the fortress. It was winter yet the sky was crystal clear. It took about 3 hours of walking to go back to Paldalmun Junction. The view was great, and please do find a park behind a bungalow watch tower. The park was very pretty. Unfortunately, I started walking at 3pm, and it got dark very quickly. So, I could not explore the whole fortress. If I could go back, I would."
Time travel,"I've been there on Aug 2014, summer time in South Korea. Too hot (over 36 °C) and too dry at this time.Be prepared... It's a long walk around the walls, it takes about half day but it really worth. Lots of ups and downs. Nice buildings along path. Old and well preserved structures. Amazing gardens. Historic places that let you to a time travel.Hint: Don't forget to make a wish when you go to ring the giant bell 3 times.Unfortunately you can't find souvenir shops easily around the Fortress."
Escape to the past,It was a wonderful walk with lots of history. The steps up to the top are challenging if you are not in shape. Once you reach the top the views are wonderful and the walk easy.
Even more beautiful in the evening,"It's a beautiful and historic place. It takes about 1.5~2 hours for one lap by foot. And there's Korean traditional market place on the way walking. You can get something to eat there. Admission fee is only $1.00/person. And if you're not into history and just want to see exotic scenery, I recommend not to use tour programs."
Great Glimpse of History,I thoroughly enjoyed this park. This buildings are beautifully preserved / Renovated and you get a glimpse of what it was like in the 1600's
Really cool,"Walked about half of the wall it was very nice and relaxing with lots of scenery. Just an fyi there is a steak place right by the Janganmun gate the building has a picture of what i think is superman with a burning S on his chest, the place is amazing! Awesome halfway food stop"
Hwaseong fortress : A must visit,"Hwaseong fortress, A UNSESCO World HerItage,is located in Suwon. It is an hour journey from Seoul .Its rebuilt after Korean War. Its in the middle of the city & is a 5.5 km hike to do the complete circle. Lots of gates & turrets with lots to explore.A Great place to roam with friends . At the top gives a nice view. A must Visit in suwon"
One hour is fine to see the main fortress,"Hwaseong is the wall surrounding the center of the city of Suwon, the provincial capital of Gyeonggi-do, South Korea. The fortress was part of a 2 site cruise ship tour.We visited for 3 plus hours - and 1 hour was more than enough to see the main site. The views from the main fort were just OK - perhaps, had we had the time to walk to the far outpost - the views would have been much better.The fortress has an archery range. One pays to shoot arrows at large targets, if archery is a hobby."
Great day trip from Seoul,"It takes an hour or two via metro, then bus to the town centre, but it is worth it for a great day trip. The info office by the metro station and main bus terminal will give you free maos and info in English.You can walk up the hill following the line of the restored wall. There are lots of gates and turrets, and wonderful views of the city and countryside. Costumed guards greetvyou as you walk around: ""Welcome to Suwon"". A lovely day out."
A Nice Piece of History,"Korea does have history other than the Korean War. This fortress provides a strong link to the past and most of the wall is intact. We walked it easily in 3 hours with plenty of breaks. There is a small fee but on certain days access is free. You'll need to check though. Oh, and for another small fee you can ring the massive bell at the top of the hill. It's well worth the effort."
Great for exercise and taking pictures!,"I've been here twice. When I went the first time, I was amazed at the wall and some of the flowers planted near it. It's an amazing place to go to during spring. But I didn't go to the top of the wall. I did just that the second time. I went with my fiancé and climbed up to the top, saw different views of the wall, a pagoda and bell at the top, and then came back down the other side. It was convenient because it led us back to where we originally started. It was a moderate hike up the mountain and great for exercise. Since few people actually want to attempt to reach the top (it's a moderate hike but not impossible), it's surprisingly very peaceful once you get to the top of the wall. I also took at least 50 pictures because you can also get a great view of Suwon from the top.This place is also near a small temple, which is free if you add them as a friend on Kakaotalk. "
THE WALL for a prince,"Great history behind this UNESCO site. Its in the middle of the city & is a 5.5 km hike to do the complete circle. Lots of gates & turrets with lots to explore. Worth the 'dragon wagon' ride to drive around part of it. We were lucky to time it & see a cultural display and musical presentation - put on for the (costumed) prince & his mom. Very well done. Lots of amazing pictures. We had purchased archery tickets, but it started raining as our time approached...so, had to get a refund. Took in the museum though, as part of our entry fee & learned a lot by walking thru the displays about the Joseon dynasty there. Nice way to spend a day."
what does tourists think?,"Hello guys, my name is MJ I will talk about ""what does tourists think?"" Moset tourists go to there because that is a famous place. It is good to know korean history. It has a old castle "
nice trip,"It's a nice place for a day trip outside Seoul. The walls are well restored and you can walk around them for even a few hours, also checking out activities like archery going on inside the walls or a traditional performance from the guards."
More real than Seoul,"When you are travelling to South Korea you might notice that everything seems unreal, like made just for tourists in order to attract more visitors. It is 100% true for most of historical places in Seoul, which look like just been drawn from some cartoon: so colorful and new. There is no a real feeling of history and time.However, Hwaseong in Suwon really surprises with its old and initial atmosphere. If you manage to walk through the whole fortress (it is quite long: 5,5 km), you might see different faces of the city and how the wall survives between modern parts. Usually there are not so many people, so it is possible to take good photos without some strangers.Some part of the fortress is located on the top of mountain, which is definetely worth to climb to see a great view on the city. During spring and blossom period, there are many magnolia and cherry trees. So the best time to visit the place is at the beginning of April."
Hwaseong Fortress,"Its a nice place to explore for those who love to walk. It has 4 gates in four directions and entry is possible from every gate. You can walk along the wall of the fortress and enjoy good views of Suwon city from an altitude. The buddha statue is visible from every corner of the fortress and when you get near it, you will be in awe. Don't miss the Bell of filial piety. You are allowed to ring this huge bell for a nominal fee and it is said that during old days, this bell was heard even from the farthest corner of the fortress."
What an amazing experience=== for Fortress Geeks of all ages.....,"Of all the things we did while staying in Seoul, this Fortress was clearly the highlight of our visit.Only a 90 minute subway ride from our Metro station in Gangnam, the one-way fare is about 1,850 won ($1.70 US).Expect to pay another $1.10 each way for the bus ride from Suwon station to the Fortress entrance.Admission to the Fortress is only 1000 won (about 90 cents US) for the entire day.Add another 1000 won for ""Ringing The Bell"", and we ended up paying about $5 (US) per person for an entire afternoon's entertainment.Expect to do lots of walking --- the entire wall is about 5.5 km circumferance.We did about 3/4 of the actual wall."
Wonderful walk around the wall,You can make a lovely walk around the wall surrounding the fortress in several hours. There are some great views and interesting sights.
Enjoyable area - make sure to ring the bell!,I had a really nice time exploring the Hwaseong Fortress area with my friend before it started raining. I liked being able to ring the bell - I think it sounds a bit better if you don't try to hit it as hard as possible.
A fortified history,"A fantastic journey back to times in South Korea when the city was secured by towering archers towers and a wall still routing through Suwon. Atop the towers you can visualize civic security in one of it's earliest forms as you overlook the sparwling and booming city of Suwon. Of course, the Cherry Blossoms predominant in South Korea's beckoning call line the paths and historic sites. Truly a place to visit and tour for an appreciation of South Korea's vitality and intense will to sovreignty!"
Fine Example of an Oriental Fortress,"The fortress is actually very big with the high walls stretching some 5.7 kilometers in circumference. The north, South, East and West gates were the entrance points on the time the fortress was occupied by the King. The gates are impressive and worth seeing each one as they are different. Inside the fortress there are people dressed in period garb as guards and such. There is some flat ground but also some hilly terrain through the forest area. Good news for a small fee you can take the little train with the dragon head front up the hilly area and then walk down. The views alone are worth the train ride.The current King still visits the fortress several times a year. Definitely worth a visit."
Excellent biking/hiking place.,"You can either hike on foot or rent bikes (Very Cheap! 1000 Korean won for 1 day and ensure you have your passport with you). Lots of hangout options, eateries. "
Trip with toddler,This place was great because my 2 year old could run around while we enjoyed the sights. Be sure to bring your walking shoes and to take the shuttle if you aren't up for the walking challenge. 
A gem just 1 and 1/2 hours south of Seoul,This is the first time I'd been to Suwon and besides being a delightful smaller city it is filled with history. The Suwon Hwaseong (Fortress) is a well preserved historical site that is easily accessed and has a number of walking options. It was a great discovery and provides views of the city but more importantly takes you back centuries to let your imagination run wild. Well worth spending a few hours there. There's also a small souvenir shop with a delightful couple selling local goods.
Historic!,"It's amazing to see the structure of the fortress, albeit and reconstruction I believe. At the top of the fortress is a great view of a palace at the bottom and onto the local area of the city. It's very nice and well looked after! "
Nice,"I would have loved to have hiked the fortress but as we had an 85yr old and 4 kids aged from 7-14, we opted to ride the trolley instead. The English commentary during the ride had limited information. The archery field is at the end of the ride. Kids and adults enjoyed that activity. A bit disappointed that they temporarily canceled the military arts performance. Had an excellent galbi meal in Suwon as they are known for their bbq. Best and cheapest Korean bbq meal we had during our whole trip to Seoul."
"Good, but nothing spectacular","Looks cool and a nice walk in good weather. Wouldn't come here especially to see it, but if you're in the area it's worth visiting."
A MUST,We went there on a Sunday afternoon! quite a lot of people in there mostly families. We were able to fly a kite which is the highlight of our visit! A very nice place to relax and enjoy! It's not everyday you can fly a kite on a fortress!
Wonderful history in our backyard,"Went to Suwon for a small trip from Songdo, Incheon. Beautiful crisp early spring day. A lovely place to walk, some little pieces of history to learn on the way. There is inexpensive archery to try, as well as a trolley to move you from one side to the other of the larger wall and complex. Full map of things in the area once there. I recommend it for a walk/learn outdoor museum kind of morning :)"
beautiful site,"Took bus 11 and got off at paldalmun gate, there was no signage on where to go so I turned right and walked up the wall, without seeing any ticket office i basically walked 1/3 without paying the KWN$1000 (this is not intentional, it's just they really don't have any ticket booth nor people to check along the way!) I started off from check point #43 and walked backwords, as mentioned this is the easiest path as check point #1 started with at least 200 steps! Spent 2hrs finishing the whole trail, easy!"
Beautiful fortress,"Place to go when staying in Suwon, great hike when it's not too hot day. Plenty pf history and architecture."
Cultural delight,We were fortunate enough to arrive just before a display of military exercises took place. It was a great introduction to life as it would have been when the Fortress was built. After that we were free to wander around the entire complex which is well kept and has signage in English.
Perfect day trip from Seoul - take your time! ,"Easy to reach in Seouls metro system (just takes time) - this fortress is incredible, a near complete wall system with 4km diameter rivaling the best of Europe! I loved that you could walk the entire thing and enjoy different views and perspectives of the surrounds! It is so beautifully well done and preserved it is no wonder UNESCO has declared it heritage of the world! Be sure to take your time and appreciate and don't forget there is a palace and tomb in the middle which is what the fortress was guarding in the first place! So quiet and peaceful I am glad I went !!"
Beautiful,"Very beautiful fortress, mist definitely worth a visit. You must pay 1,000 won to enter the grounds and walk along the fortress, but can pay 3,500 to enter the various areas like the palace too, which I would recommend. There are also cultural staff walking around the grounds, and very happy to give you a tour and talk to you about the history of the fortress. They may be a little shy to approach English speakers, but their English is actually very good. Just ask them to take your photo and they will offer to show you around after :) "
A wonderful fortress,"A must-do in Suwon, that is only one-hour away by subway from Seoul. It is a two-hour wlak along the fortress. I really enjoyed the tour"
Nice day out at Hwaseong,"Family of three was there just after Christmas 2015. Wonderful place I would say and is very good to have such fantastic place still nested in a developed city. Had lunch in one of the restaurant in the food street before completing a walk round the fortress. As it was winter, weather was perfect for the walk. Also strolled through the local markets where locals visit after the walk. A place not to be missed if you do visit Korea. Give yourself enough time to walk, enjoy the view from various spot along the fortress."
A great walk,"I went here during the summer. Hwaseong fortess was beautiful. There weren't a lot of people, and I didn't spend a dime. Apparently they charge people, but on the day I went everything was free! I walked around the fortress by myself, taking pictures and listening to music. It was wonderful having that time to myself while looking at nature.  And after walking the whole fortress, I went to looks at the Hanok I had seen while walking up Hwaseong Fortress. I'm really glad I was able to come here. And I recommend it to people who just want to have a quiet walk!"
"Good walk along the wall, but palace is plain.","Palace was about 1,500 to get in. It only took about 10 minutes for people who have seen other palaces. It's not the biggest.However, the wall paths was well maintained and relatively easy to walk on. One or two parts are rather steep. But at about 5.6km, it's easy to wall the whole path if you have the time. Some parts do have good view of the surrounding areas."
Very peaceful and scenic walk,"The greatest thing about this gem of an attraction is that it was not filled with tourists. It was probably because we went on a weekday morning, but I thoroughly enjoyed my visit to this peaceful part of the city.The climb up to the top of the fortress was not too challenging, and the view from the top was great, you could see almost the entire city! Walking along the fortress walls was also enjoyable as it was peaceful and scenic, dotted with interesting features (e.g. temples, bells, look-out towers).Best time to go is in the morning at around 10am. The car park was empty when we arrived at 10am, but was very full when we left at about 1pm. To avoid the crowds, come early. It is really worth it.The parking at the attraction was on a 3-hr basis, so if you may wish to plan your route within 3 hrs."
Nice fortress with good view of the city,Enjoy walking along the fortress. You can choose some part of the fortress. The north gate is nice and peacefull. Take 30 mins to walk from the gate to the pavillion and see some shop. Tpilet is not far from this.
Nice walk on the old wall,A nice 2-3 hours stroll on the old wall of Hwaseong fortress will take you through many gates and buildings that are well preserved. And don't forget to visit the palace in the middle of the fortress.
History and a good walk,"The fortress is large. Be prepared for a bit of a walk. We initially saw the palace, looked around the well preserved wooden structures. Then we climbed to the ridge where the wall runs, first seeing a guard tower. There we had a magnificent view of Seoul. Walking along the wall, we passed by various sites. It was a fun visit."
Great wall to walk through time and history,"We took the Mugunghwa Train from Seoul Station to Suwon Station - about half hour at KRW4000+ per person. We then went to the Tourism office (take exit 4 and the office entrance is just across the exit) and the staff said it was half hour's walk to the fortress. It being a beautiful late morning, we decided to walk. Quite straightforward - went back to exit 4, down the stairs and turned left, took exit 3 to cross to other side of main road (underground). Walked past exits 7, 8, 1 and 2 until a building with a giant tv screen on its rooftop - could be seen from the tourism office. Took a left and walked along the road for quite a stretch. Passed the Faith Baptist Church (red brick building) on other side of road. Walked some more and passed the Lee Chun Tek Hospital on other side of road. Took a left and walked straight on until a sort of roundabout which was Paldalmun Gate. Took a left and we could see the uphill steps to the fortress. Entrance fee is KRW1000 per person. Uphill climb, to say the least, was not easy. Good thing we had a hearty lunch of budaejigae (army stew) at a small eatery next to the entrance. It was about 5km around the fortress, about a 2+hour walk. Excellent view of the city of Suwon. We were there on Wed ie. missed the Saturday cultural show. But we did a bit of traditional archery KRW2000 per person for 10 arrows. Good fun! The walk ended at the markets - plenty of eats to replenish burnt calories.We then took a taxi to Bonsuwon Galbi (about 15 mins away, KRW4000+ fare) and took the train back to Seoul after. One of the best day trips ever!"
"Brief visit, would've liked more time","I was only here for a few hours, went to see the martial art display they do most days. Martial art display was very impressive and worth going to see, also because it is free to watch. Tried walking alone the fortress wall but had to give up as it was in the rainy season and it was pouring down."
"Well Preserved ""Great Wall of Korea""","We took the 30-min rail from Seoul to Sueon (costs 4800 won). We visited the Korean Folk Village before making our way to Hwaseong. To go to Hawseong Fortress, go to the bus stop near Suwon Exit 4, take bus number 11, 13, 36 or 39 from the same side of the road. The buses use T-money. Drop off at Paldalmun, which is a fort like structure on your life in a small roundabout so you won't missed it . Walk in the direction in the attached map. Do note that the last trolley (tram) leaves at 445pm. We had to run up the stairs to make it in time for the last trolley as we left Korean Folk Village on the 330om shuttle. So if you intend to visit both the Korean Folk Village and Hwaseong Fortress, start your day early by taking the 1030am shuttle to the village and return to Suwon on the 2pm shuttle. You can make a stop mid of the trolley ride to take photo and hop on again the next trolley. The Trolley ride costs 1500 won. You can walk to Paldalmun Market to do some shopping or dinner before making your way back to Suwon Station. The fare back to Seoul from Suwon was 2700 won. The buses going back to Suwon is also stated in the attached map，."
Amazing trip,"It take some time to go all of the wall, but it wort it. Take your kids, let them try bow shooting for free with a guide."
Good view point for Hwaseong,"The old fortress since Joseon dynasty is a good point for viewing the whole city. You have to climb the stairs up the hill which is very steep but very good for exercise. On the top, you will find the old stone wall, small observatory and a small building. Walking along the stone wall to the gate is pleasant. Picnic up there is OK. But if you don't have enough time, just skip this fortress."
Interesting place and lots of walking,"We went here as part of a Veltra tour. Lucky for us, it was just the two of us. Guide was very nice and bubbly.It is about a 40 minute drive here from Seoul.We took a train ride to the look out point. Not sure how many steps it was to the top, but it definitely is not for those who don't like hiking. It was quite a mini work out. We unfortunately did not have time to see the statues.From there, we walked to the palace replica. It was nicely done. Hopefully in the future they would make more figurines depicting the way of life in the palace.Around the palace, there are a lot of quaint shops to browse in."
"""The great wall of korea""?","Its like ""the great of wall of china"" korea versionnice view from the topnegative: need to climb steep stairs ."
Must Visit UNESCO site in Suwon!,Amazing fortress with great history and performances. Don't miss out on the Stream that runs through both ends of the fortress. About less than an hour train journey from Seoul. Worth a visit.
Hwaseong fortress Festival!!,This year I was in South Korea during the Hwaseong Festival. It is an amazing fortress and has great historical value. From traditional dances and archery courses to round trips with the train cart. The most amazing was going up the mountain. The view and size of the fortress then become really visible.
Fortress,"A very different feeling from the other palaces. It does not feel very majestic like the other palaces. More towards a heavy feeling. A place of defense. Watch towers on hill tops. High walls along the hills. Still, it is an interesting place to visit. Beautiful architecture as always!"
Well worth the trip from seoul,"Beautiful place, but be aware - it takes a lot of walking and step climbing to really appreciate this site. There is a trolley that you can ride around the fortress , but it takes away the ability to visit all the places of interest. Take line 1 on the subway to Suwon, but be careful to make sure you are on the right train destination as it divides down the line. Many bus lines then take you to the south gate.. With a short walk to the fortress. Ask the very friendly tourist office just to the left of the main station exit for guidance."
A Great Day Trip,The Hwaseong Fortress is a great day to visit in Suwon. It is free and it will take more than 30 minutes to go through the whole thing. It a sense it similar to a mini Wall of China because it cover a lot of space in Suwon. It also not a bad stop before going to Seoul since Suwon is only 30 minutes from there. I highly recommend this trip for anyone that want to check out the History of Korea in this city.
Great surroundings ,Some good surroundings with good views good for taking photos see that the day is a good.it hss a lot of heritage too.
Nice to visit,This is a little out of the way from Seoul (an hour or so from the Myeongdong area) but it's very nice. Walk through the walls of the fortress and enjoy!
"Make sure to go around the entire fortress, there is so much to see","Suwon Hwaseong Fortress is an amazing sight. First and foremost, it's been preserved perfectly. Not only the walls, but the gates, paintings, pagodas as well as the surrounding lawns and river streams. I would absolutely recommand going around the entire circuit, as each side offers different sights. There are numerous gates on the fortress, all of them seemingly very different in their design. Also, don't miss out on the Stream that runs through both ends of the fortress. There are also lawns that were used for archery that fit in very well with the Fortress. But the topography of the wall is definitely what makes it a must-see. You have some small hills every now and then, and obviously the much bigger Paldalsan, which offers a gorgeous panorama of the city. Each location offers a different facet : the shaman village, the dormant old city of Suwon, the surrounging mountains, the lively areas near the main gates, and the truly bustling areas that you can see from afar such as Suwon Station or the Suwon World Cup Stadium."
Historic Experience,The fort requires a climb but the views are worth the effort!Don't forget to experience the various cultural shows at the base of the fort.
MUST SEE THIS,This fortress is worth the walk up-if you can handle it. We got to the top and hung out up there for a long time. It was so beautiful and there is so much to see here. Pictures cannot capture the beauty here.
UNESCO World Heritage in Suwon,"Restored well in its original shapes. So many interesting stories to be shared. It is about an hour and a half circumference walk. Some activities include ring the bell, riding a dragon train, watch martial arts performance of royal guards, shooting traditional archery and on the weekend, there are some activities for children. It is a good place for a family visit. "
The Fortress,"When I arrived to the fortress, I was very surprised to be informed that it's free during that day. I am still not sure what was the occasion but I was glad. I went on a very hot day though, so it was very difficult to even just simply walk around. I was practically bathing in my own sweat. Luckily, you can take a break in the fortress towers and posts. You take off your shoes and sit on the floor. It was really relaxing with the shade and breeze, I could sleep there. At one of the gates, very nice guard dressed in traditional garb, told me not to walk anymore and just take the Dragon train, which also happened to be free on that day. So I did and it was good decision. I did some sightseeing in the centre and then walked back by the fortress to the dragon train gate from the other side. I enjoyed this trip because I was by myself but I met bunch of very kind and helpful Korean people on that day so i have only the best memories of this place."
Nice place for easy trek,It is a nice walk uphill exploring the fortress. I would recommend not going on a hot day. It is enjoyable with good company.
Relaxing walk,"A really nice walk for a beautiful day on the wall around the old City. Goes a bid up and down, reserve at least 2 -3 hours."
be ready for a walk,"this fortress is a workout, i was taken here by surprise and at first i was miserable walking up so many stairs or rather in general but once i got to the top, i honestly felt great and i got to ring the bell at the top. it was fantastic."
A lovely fortress ,"Spent a wonderful few hours wandering around. Mostly original so very old...a lot has been restored so was brightly coloured and lovely to look at.The palace within the walls is definitely worth a visit.Suwon is an easy train journey from Seoul. If you've got a few hours to spare, Suwon makes a pleasant and relaxing change to the hustle and bustle of Seoul. "

First UNESCO fesignated World Heritage in South Korea,"This modern 18th century city development project by the order of King Jeongjo who constantly struggled with those in authority in late Choseon dynasty. Though this creature has never used as the fortrees but precious and another proud UNESCO heritage, the records and all the documents for the building is not-to-be-missed. If you compare this with other huge stone wall like Great Wall of China, this is not even tiny bulding but the history and design and building stiry and related documents cannot be defeated. One of the must-visit in South Korea. Do not forget to check the construction history and 華城城役儀軌, The Construction Records of Hwaseong Fortress before the visit. http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/817"
"Beautiful fortress, nice walk","Great venue. Well maintained and a very nice stroll when the weather is good. Plenty of nice spots for a picnic, too!"
Ancient sights to stir your imagination,"This fortress is 5km to complete with lots of interesting stops along the way. There are lookouts, an incredible view of the city, a palace, and even a place to try your hand at archery. If you are going to visit Suwon, this is a place to see!"
Hwaseong Fortress,Excellent day! The fortress sites are scattered throughout a small area so you can choose which parts to visit. Some have short hikes in order to reach them. The gate with the waterfall/canal was beautiful. Definitely worth seeing if you have a day to spare. Bare in mind that it is quite far outside of the city cener.
"Fortifications, Gates, Palace","This is a complex object, consisting of a very long wall around the old town, a number of gates, fortifications, and a palace. Perhaps it is not worth to come here as a tourist, but when you are on a business trip this is pleasant weekend target."
Ancient city walls to walk along,"This fort is spread out throughout much of Suwon, and you can walk along the ancient walls for miles. In some areas there are lookouts, vendors, park-like areas where families are walking, flying kites, and picnicing."
Fortress in CONJUNCTION with Korean FOLK VILLAGE!,"Took the bus from GangNam to the Korean Folk Village. Hung out there for some time exploring how Koreans lived back in the day and ate some yum food in the food area. After, we took another bus to the Fortress area. We walked and walked and walked the Fortress and took a billion pictures. It's a cool place to see if you're in the neighborhood. I would definitely make an early day of it at the Korean Folk Village and stop by here ~~ doubt I would come just to see this though...as cool as it is. AND if you do come here -- do NOT forget to stop by and check out a GALBI place in this area ... SUWON is known for their GALBI!!! I travelled here in NOV 2011 ... not 2014. :)"
"Amazing, but not too ancient history","We traveled to Suwon on a guided USO tour on Saturday and found the experience a great cultural event. The highlight was the martial arts demonstration at the 'Temporary' palace at 11:00 am. The fortress and palace were built in three years in the 1790s by the 23rd Emperor of the Jeoseon dynasty as a tribute to his father who was murdered by his grandfather. Our tour included a walk on the ramparts, views of the gate structures, a ride on the tram to the gilded Buddha within the palace, then a trek downhill to the 'Temporary' palace and a walk through the intricate structure. The palace tour was apparently the priciest part of the trip, but you are paying for the upkeep of the place as well as the martial arts performances."
A good walk but nothing special,"I would only recommend a visit if you have extra time to spare and have not ever visited an Asian fortress. The view was not particularly spectacular and the fortress not impressive.The fortress could be done one-way - there are multiple points of exit where you could leave to catch a bus or run across to a convenient store to buy a bottle of water and return to the walk. If starting from the visitor's booth, the initial climb was steep but not very long. The rest was fairly easy. There was a segment with a long descent which I am glad I did not have to climb up on return (one left after Yeonpo Galbi :)). "
Not much to see,"It is not worth a trip just to see Hwaseong Fortress. After 1/2 hour what else do you do? Add the Korean Folk Village, where you will spent more than 80% of your time there. "
Nothing to write home about,"The best part of Korea is its people. The country is totally underwhelming for us the jaded travelers. Japanese destroyed almost everything historic and every heritage property and symbols during their brutal occupation. Then the Koreans followed the lead and kept on destroying until someone woke up and started protecting some of the things still semi-leftover. In the middle of the concrete jungle in every city of South Korea one can not find anything really worth saying ""wow"". Actually the same is true in countryside as well because there is almost no real country side left anymore. Everything is industrialized.As some travelers wrote here, most of the buildings except a tower are rebuilt and it shows. Yes, if you have extra time in life, it is worth an hour or two to walk around this fortress but it is not a place we will ever want to come back.Easy to go there by visiting the Tourist Information Center next to Suwong Station and get the bus numbers and a map. The nearby local market area is way more interesting that the fortress ground and walls itself."
Nice one day Trip,Its a very good landscape. Bow and arrow experience was good. The place is not that big. But well maintained. Nice place to visit on a day trip. English guide available.
Definitely worth a trip from Seoul,One hour by train (line 1) from the centre of Seoul. Then 2 km walk from the railway station (or by taxi/bus).Very nice fortress and wall. We actually liked it more than some places in Seoul. The fortress itself requires no effort. The walk over the wall includes steep climb to the top. The path is however excellent and it does not appear to be as demanding as some other reviews suggest.
Wonderful Day Trip,"My husband and I spent an entire day there, walking around the fortress. It was beautiful and very relaxing. We did the archery and rang the big bell, both very reasonably priced. The lady that instructed for the archery was very nice and informative. She also gave instructions in both Korean and English. There was also a dragon trolley you could ride around the park. We did not ride this, but it was cool watching them drive around. You could very easily spend an entire day there."
"LOTS of stairs, but INCREDIBLE (almost 360º) views @ King's Summer Place lol","Let me start by saying if you are physically challenged or older and not good at climbing you may want to make alternate plans....I am 29 years old and in amazing shape (not trying to toot my own horn, but I run a mile in about 5:30) and muscularly I was incredibly sore after spending the day here climbing the zillions of stairs, however it was well worth it to see something so neat! There were a few spots off the stairs with seating where you could rest, but we chose to climb quickly since we intended to save as much time for eating and visiting the toilet museum afterwards.There was a small fee for entering the fortress and looking at the rooms etc, but I recommend skipping that and going straight for the stairs (unless you speak Korean fluently and are really interested in looking at museum style exhibits of where the people sat in the rooms and what they did etc. kinda boring). Aside from the awesome views atop the hill, you can watch cultural demonstrations including martial arts and historically dress performers, ring the gong, plus there was an adorable trolley ride (I forget the exact cost but it was reasonable...maybe $10?) which cuts down on a whole lotta walking and takes you to another park inside the huge wall encasing most of the city where you can sign up to shoot a bow and arrow for something like 2,000KW or about $2 USD....but sign up early for the trolley and archery though because the time slots fill up quickly! Across from the archery area you can see more of the wall that surrounds the city and watch dozens of locals flying kites! There was even a booth with 2 women handing out FREE hand wipes and seat cushions so we could sit and watch/picnic for awhile!"
Amazing history - best seen on foot,"I was able to see a bit of the Korean history and Hwaseong Fortress for a couple of hours only. I would love to go back and spend a good part of the day however. There is a combined ticket that lets you get into various attractions and I suggest getting that. One could walk for miles along the fortress wall which of course isn't high or imposing but the whole fortress, palace and museum is very enchanting. Not many people (tourists and workers) speak English and few of the detailed information boards are in English but still one can enjoy the history. I wanted to take the trolley/tram as well but the timing didn't suit."
Start Early! There's so much to see!,"We travelled from central Seoul to Suwon by train and bus and it took us almost 2 hours to get to the fortress. There's a trolley that takes you around the area. But we decided to go around first by foot so we can have more time to take photos and enjoy the beautiful flowers. There are benches everywhere, and a food stall. But I have not seen any restaurants within the fortress. Outside, maybe? Although it's spring time, walking around the pathway surrounded by walls can get very hot. Get a map from the information tourist center. Entrance is KRW 1,000. The trolley takes you to the gate where there is the traditional Korean archery. It's a must try!"
Very Impressive,"The wall is amazing and long. You could do a lot of walking here if you wanted too. We went when the cherry blossoms were in bloom. Very pretty time of year. Take a kite and fly on the grounds. It's very breezy here. Try some archery for a small fee. The guides will tell you exactly how to handle your bow and arrow so that if you might hit the target.There is a little train ride which we did not take, but I hear it isn't very long and not that great. The English translations on the signage around the fortress is good."
Endless wall....,"Impressive stone walls but a bit dull. there is a little tram that takes you around a section of the wall, worth taking. But the attraction is not thrilling and not worth a special trip from Seoul. The cultural Village nearby is fun; add that to the day trip and it will be a better plan."
A Must Day Trip From Seoul,"This is a highly recommended day trip from Seoul, you can take the metro all the way there on a line, takes up to about an hour to get there.The fortress is huge and takes a whole day to walk the whole fortress but it worth it. At one point you can buy a combo ticket to see the extras, which I highly recommend to see the entire area, as it is needed. Go on a clear day though as it would make it much more pleasurable. At some parts of the wall walk, there are quite a lot of steps (going up and down), but there are ramps as well if you hate walking up steps. Along the way there are shops and little cafes, and it does end one section in the a part of Suwon where you can get a nice meal for real cheap (and do some shopping while you are at it). If you look at the ground at some parts, there will be little plaques that say ""Photo"", this would be one of the best areas to take a photo of said area. Keep an eye out for that."
Take the Dragon tram,"The fortress covers a big area and taking the Dragon tram/trolley will be a good time saver. To take the tram, you must walk up a slope for 10 mins. Find the tourist information centre near palalmun to ask for direction to the tram stop. We took a taxi from Suwon station and the taxi dropped us right outside Hwaseong Haenggung, and we paid for admission without realizing that it is for the palace. Visit to Suwon fortress is free and it surrounds a big area. All you need to pay is for the tram. There is nothing much to see in Hwaseong Haenggung, especially if you have already visited other palaces like Changdeokgung."
A Unique Fortress Complex (a World Heritage Site),"You may take the MRT to Suwon Metro Station on Line 1. You are advised to ask your hotel to print out a small map showing the location of the fortress town in Korean which is not far from the Suwon Station. Then emerging from this station, ask any Korean at the bus stand there which bus to take. The bus fare is just 800 won. Show the bus driver the map and ask him to indicate to you when to get down. Virtually all the buses pass through this town. Of course you may opt for a taxi if you wish. Upon reaching the place, look for a tourist information office and ask for a brochure in English. You need to buy a ticket to enter the Hwaseong Haenggung complex. After your tour of the buildings in this complex, upon exiting the complex, it is free of charge to walk a complete loop along the rather low fortress wall. Just look at the brochure you had obtained from the information office and you may walk a clockwise loop and you will find interesting/lovely structures such a the Main Fortress Gates, Command Posts, Sentry Posts, Turrets, Observation Towers, Secret Gates, Pavillions. I had seen the Great Wall of China, the fortress walls and main gates at Xian and other cities in China which are rather similar. The China fortress walls are high and would be tough to climb and by comparison I reckon it would be very much easier to scale this Korean fortress wall! Good luck to this fortress's attackers! However the architecture of the structures is rather admirable. By the way there are many restaurants near the fortress and you can ask the locals which bus stand to wait for bus back to Suwon Metro Station. Virtually all the buses goes to Suwon Station. An enjoyable sight."
A UNESCO WHS - western influence,"A neat fortress built in the 1700's with an influence of European military tactics. The walls circle nearly 6km, so there is plenty of variety amongst the different gates."
A sight of an orient fortress, Impressive old long wall with curious military buildings. Quite different from European castles and city walls that are normally much larger and higherUK . The monument is considered a world heritage. 
Imagination required,"On a chilly February afternoon, we took the Seoul Metro out to the busy Suwon station. We opted for a taxi (4000₩) to reach the Hwaseong Fortress and its defensive walls. I admire the reconstructive restorations that have been completed to portray this part of Korean history, but despite being designated a World Heritage Site, it simply just does not possess the aura of history that permeates one's pores in such awe-inspiring sites such as Les Remparts de St. Malo or of those in la ville de Quebec. These two latter sites, by the way, are also free of charge.Nonetheless, it was pleasing to walk up along the walls, read the explanations provided and snap some lovely shots of the town below, which ultimately proved to be the saving grace (exploring the streets and markets) of this outing."
Very interesting,"I live in Suwon and went for the guided tour of the fortress. The tour lasted about 4 hours or half a day. There is a great deal of walking as you will visit various parts of the fortress scattered over the city of Suwon, so be sure to wear comfortable shoes. You can request for a rather informal guided tour in several languages - English and Japanese by, I think, volunteer guides. There is also an archery filed that you can try if the weather is OK."
beautiful historical monument,"It's beatiful historical place in the city. Wall is 5km long with some a sections and we can see the old history at this place :) ... Suwon is nice city but Hwaseong Fortress ist the best monument in the city. You have to visit this place, if you wanna to feel a part of history :)"
Awesome afternoon,"It was a Korean friend's suggestion to visit Suwon for an afternoon and it was really great. We went by bus from Seuol and the way there didn't take too long. The fortress is actually pretty long, it goes up a mountain and through some streets, but it you have the physical energy it is worth it pursuing it. From the mountain you can have a great view of the city, including the palace, which is great. At sunset some lights start to get on and turn the place even more attractive."
Expected more,"Took a day trip from Seoul by subway/metro to Hwaseong Fortress in Suwon and liked the overall experience of the Fortress and the surroundings, not just the Fortress. The fortress is an easy 1-2 hour walk inside and around the perimeter. Perhaps I had been to quite a few castles and fortresses, and so I was expecting more as a UNESCO Heritage Site. Recommend that you visit the Tourist Office before visiting the Fortress to obtain information about the Fortress, which you can locate just outside the subway station upon arrival. The Tourist Office was extremely helpful; at least one staff spoke English, and they will point directions on how to find buses to the Fortress from the subway station, as well as provide explanations of the Fortress. Besides the Fortress, there are very interesting wet markets nearby the Fortress which I recommend a visit if you have time. I was also fortunate to chance across one cart-pusher selling raw ginseng near to the markets. Although the Tourist Office recommended nice beef barbecued eatry in the Fortress, I preferred the many eatries outside the Fortress."
Beautiful,We took a 50mins slow walk along the fortress instead of a more direct route of 15mins walk to the Paldamum market. The scenery and the fortress is beautiful. We went around 2.30pm. there wasn't a lot of people. We took our time to enjoy the serenity and the scenery. 
A must for history buffs,"Located in Suwon, Hwaseong Fortress is rich in history and significance. The climb up is totally worth it (easy if you're fit and a good work out if you're not so fit) as it leads you to a panoramic view of Suwon city."
From the past of Korea,It was amazing. It was a huge fortress built many years ago. A long walk to know everything but it is worth.
The best castle in Korea.,This is the first time I visit this place and I like it more than the castle in Seoul. There is a small train to take and you could look all around the castle. There are also some activities and show to attend. I will come back again.
Great walk,"Beautiful walk around the fortress walls at Suwon. The walls are over 5km long and have some very steep sections, but if you can cope with the steps you get a wonderful view over the city.Easily accessible from seoul by train or metro, you can walk to the fort in about 30 mins, or take a bus. If you don't fancy the climb up to the top, take the dragon train."
Good Day Trip in Suwon,"Given the UNESCO Heritage site status, we knew we had to visit the Hwaseong Fortress at Suwon. We took the 35 minute regional express train to Suwon (KRW2,700 with a reserved seat and comfortable leg room) as compared to the subway (at least an hour's ride). Just outside the Suwon station, we got our maps and directions from a friendly guide at the Suwon Tourist Information Center who basically planned the route of our Suwon escapade (what's you'll see, buses to take etc). It is about a 30 min walk to the fortress if you decide to be adventurous - I will suggest you keep that enthusiasm for the fortress walk and take a bus. At the fortress, we saw the various command sentry and military commands posts, Hyowon's Bell (ring the bell for the experience!!), the imposing Hwaseomun Gate, Janganmun Gate and the Hwahongmun Gate. We had high expectations for the last gate as articles were written how beautiful it was with the stream flowing. But alas, there was hardly any water. In its place, cheesy statues were placed in the dam area.Overall, a good walk but it does get a bit monotonous after a while ..."
UNESCO,The fortress is located in Suwon. It took us about 1h from Seoul by metro. It has a great view over the city. It's interesting the mix of architectures: ancient and modern. The fortress is nice. There are several gates and towers along the wall.
Unesco Heritage Site in Suwon,"I would take the City tour bus for easy access to the fortress. I just hope they skip the toilet tour, such a waste of time. "
Must Visit this City,"Its an interesting city with the historic fortress surrounding the modern city. I will recommend that you take a korail rain (2,700 won) to Suwon (Go to the website to check out the train timing: www.letskorail.com/ebizbf/EbizBfIndex_eng.do) and thereafter take bus 11 or 13 or 36 or 39 (left side of the exit of the station) to Paldalmun (or when you see the big fortress Entrance). You can use T money for the bus. To view the whole fortress, I recommend that you take the Hwaseong Trolley. It is very popular 54- seat train and ticket sold out fast and so take note to buy the ticket first when you arrive at Suwon. There are 2 ticket booth. One is at the upslope hill near the Hwaseong Haenggung Palace and the other at Yeonmudae. So do visit the tourist Information booth for the direction. There are 2 interesting performance during Sat (24 Martial Arts at 11am & 3pm and Traditional drama performance at 2pm). And so I recommend that you go Suwon on Sat. The performance is held infront of the Hwaseong Haenggung Palace. The Haenggung street (aka Insadong) is also an interesting shopping street selling handmade crafts, workshops. I will recommend this place to you if you are interested about historical & cultural place."
18th century city wall,"Hwaseong Fortress is the wall surrounding the old city center of Suwon, about 1 hour from Seoul by train or bus. I was orginally built at the end of the 18th centuryand it has been well restored (rebuilt?) in recent years. It is a UNESCO site and well worth a trip if you are in Seoul.The entire length is about 10km in circumference and there is a good path around the wall, although south east section of the wall is off limits at the moment. The total length is about 10km and it would about 3 hours, including the hilly section along the western section.There are many turrets, towers and gates along the wall but after a while it can get a bit monotonous. If pressed for time, the best features are between the Hwaseomun gate and Hwahongmun gate, along the norther section."
One of the best in Suwon probably,"The fortress covers a large area, so just be ready to walk and climb up and down the stairs a lot. But once, you reach the top, it's a beautiful view. It gives a complete view of the Suwon city which is really enjoyable. "
Not bad,"It's a huge area, you should wear a sneaker. If there is a chance, i want to go back.. I definitely like Korea (south)."
Suwon UNESCO,"Many people don't know Suwon Hwaseong is UNESCO world heritage. But when visit Suwon all visiter understand why Suwon Fortress became UNESCO world heritage.You will keep full 1 day for Suwaon trip and must stay until after Sunset, can enjoy really beautiful night view. Here from Seoul 1 hour's drive distance and from Seoul station can ride train, it spent less 30 minute."
Introduction of Suwon Hwaseong,"Suwon Hwaseong, which is UNESCO World Heritage, is made in times of King Jeongjo. Baebong mountain loacted in Yangju to Suwon Hwaseong . He thought that he had to move his father's grave to Suwon is to make a new political place to enhance his regal power. He needed three conditions, servant military power and money to handle them smoothly to actualize his ideal. Jeongjo got a conclusion that it is hard to get these three conditions in Seoul and it is best to build a new city. If he had achieved both goal connected to his father's commermorating work it counldn't have been more perfect. Because Suwon is a major transportation point that links Seoul and southern region of Koreans peninsula, and Sado seja's Hyunrungwon was near there. Jeongjo assigned Jeong yagyoung a work to accomplish his ambition. The construction was expeected to take ten years to complete but it didn't. October, 1796, Nakseongyeon was run in only 34 months. The reason why giant construction like building Suwon Hwaseong took only half and two year is young silhak scholars like Jeong yagyong had participated to build it unlike the old day's plan. The one of amazing things about Hwaseong is that all of process of building Hwaseong is written perfectly. From preparing step to completion, lots of books and reports were written and Hwaseong is the only city which has specific data about construction. If you look at the <화성성역의궤>, you can see there was a big change in building materials and technique. It was the first time to use bricks in construction, though it was some pars of Hwaseong. The beauty of carve and ruggedness which bricks have, it could be built strong and beautiful. Also it was designed to use natural enviroment and show the beauty of Hwaseong. Hwaseong is Korea's typical castle city of the Joesun era's essence of construction culture. This showed us new figures about meaterials to building techniques, scale, and shape unlike other castles that has built before Hwaseong. Pictrues Suwon Hwaseong is our proud cultural heritage which is orients and wetern's architectures are in harmony."
A Very Scenic Walk,I were lucky enough to both be staying inside the wall and be with a history buff. You should consider checking out the Suwon Hwaseong Museum inside first or at least reading a bit of history about it (very interesting family behind its construction).Starting by the south gate and heading west up the hill seems to be the best place to start as it's right by a major bus connection. It took my friends and I about 3 hours to walk slowly along the wall taking lots of pictures. There's a fee to charge the bell at the top of the hill but it was well worth it as I did not encounter another bell that size that I was allowed to ring on my trip.At the end there's a market to look around and if you head towards the middle there's plenty of restaurants and shops to keep you occupied.Aside from the first hill it's a relatively easy walk with lots of things to see and I consider it a must-do if you visit Suwon.
Easy Day Trip from Seoul,"Easy trip on the metro to Suwon station. I was all excited to ask the taxi driver to take me to Hwaseong Fortess in Korean but to my dismay he seemed to have no idea what I was talking about. Then I realized since it is so large he didn't know where exactly. Luckily I had the tourist map and picked a spot. Walking along the wall is beautiful along with the palace, I took the tourist train from the palace to the wall and walked back. It was pretty hot so it was nice to be in the shade of the train. On the way back I couldn't find a cab so I just started walking towards the station and found one on the way."
Worth devoting a day for it!,"This is a must-see, especially if you're into history!However, I recommend devoting an entire day for this amazing place! I went in mid-afternoon after I got back to Suwon Station from the Korean Folk Village via free shuttle bus at around 2:30pm, so by the time I got there to start off, it was close to 3pm. If you start in the morning, you'll be able to walk the whole thing, take your time, and really see and experience everything. Make sure that you wear good running shoes/comfortable walking footwear. You'll be walking a lot and climbing a lot of stairs, depending on where you start off. Also, you can ride the cheap, cute dragon trolley that they have, but if you do so, you'll miss out on major photo opps."
Walking on Hwaseong Fortress,"We arrived at our hostel in Suwon early afternoon and after visiting Hwaseong Palace in the old center we headed to climb the Fortress. We started our walk around 4:30 pm which was nice because it was cloudy and it wasn't too hot anymore. The walk took us approximatively one hour and a half and gave us a beautiful view of the city, with a strange contrast between older traditional constructions and modern buildings. We really enjoyed it and I definitely recommend paying the Won 1,000 fee to walk along the fortress. (For those who really don't enjoy walking there is a little train that can take you along the Fortress!)"
"Plan a lot of time, great for an extended walk","The fortress is beautiful and it's wonderful to walk along the fortress walls. (Maybe choose a time that's not as hot and humid, it was pretty exhausting ). We did not have enough time to see the inside of the palace but the whole fortress looks nice and has lots of things to do. You can take the stairs up the hill to have a beautiful 360 degree view on Suwon and Seoul, pay a little fee to ring the big bell or try the archery (only available once or twice per hour). We went on a Saturday and there were people in historical costumes as well.Hint: Don't rely on the trolley or go there first to buy the tickets and spend some time at the station. We skipped it as the waiting time for the next available tickets was too long."
UNESCO rated place,"Like mini copy of Chinees great wall, but with own history and architecture. Wery long area, to walk it around you need something like one and half of hour."
The little wall of Korea,"Be prepared to walk! There is a trolley that will drive you around, but you can see so much more by walking. At the east gate they have archery festivities and drum festivals. On the inside of the fortress is the old town. A living center that was not destroyed. It's wonderful to see the juxtaposition of the urban center against the ancient history. The palace is also the setting for a lot of period K-dramas!"
The place you have to go in Korea,"This fortress was made in the end of 18c, the period of Choseon dynasty, and it shows very technical and artistic scene for us. It was built on the plane, not on the mountain, and stones, brick used to make. The King, Jeong-jo, want to make a ideal new town in here, then this place was just a plane where being always wet like swamp. Nowdays, there are fortress, traditional buildings that restored, and also museum. If you get a chance to visit Suwon city, don't forget going to this fortress. Just a hour, you can finish to walk all around the fortress. Also special guide cars are there."
